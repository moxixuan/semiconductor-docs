All\nappropriate precautions to avoid contamination should be followed.\n6. 1  Reagents  and  Standards  \u2014  Reagents  and  standards  used  should  be  of  the  same  high-purity  as  used  in  the\nanalysis  of  samples.  Accurate  standard  solutions  of  trace  contaminants  are  needed  for  the  preparation  of  the\ncalibration standards. Commercially available standard solutions are suitable. These solutions should be traceable to\nNIST standards. Working standard solutions should be prepared on the day of use by dilution of the stock standard\nsolution. Standards and blanks should be matrix-matched to the sample to be analyzed.\n6. 2  Operating Conditions\n6. 2.1  Instrumental  \u2014  Principles  of  instrumental  analysis  are  provided  within  many  monographs.  No  general\noperating  conditions  are  given  here  since  these  will  vary  with  the  instrument  type  and  design;  consequently,  the\nmanufacturers manual should be followed.\n6. 2.2  Standard  and  Sample  Preparation  \u2014  With  certain  methods,  the  achievable  MDL  can  be  improved  by  pre-\nconcentration. Some methods require matrix dilution to run some analyses and may also affect the MDL.\n6. 2.3  Calibration  \u2014  Calibrate  the  instrument  for  all  specified  trace  contaminants  using  measurement  and\npreparation  protocols  identical  to  those  used  in  sample  preparation  and  measurement,  wherever  appropriate.  The\ncalibration data structure used to determine the MDL should be as close to identical as possible to the data structure\nnormally  used  for  calibration  in  the  laboratory.  Minimum  data  requirements  should  be  determinations  at,  at  least,\ntwo concentration levels (standards), each independently sampled 3 times. The lowest concentration standard should\nbe at, or below, the specification and give a measurable signal. The blank may be used in the calculation of the MDL\nif its variability is judged to be representative of that of a very low-level standard. All instrument response data used\nin  the  analysis  should  be  measurable.  The  calibration  range  can  be  adjusted  for  instrument  sensitivity  by  pre-\nconcentration or dilution to match with how the samples are analyzed. Use the data collected to calculate the MDL\nusing the formulas in the next section.\n6. 3  Quantification of the MDL\n6. 3.1  The  MDL  is  calculated  by  using  the  results  from  a  regression  analysis  of  the  calibration  data  to  obtain  a  3\nsigma equivalent (in probability) upper confidence limit of individual measurements. Two alternative computational\nmethods  are  provided  for  linear  calibration  models.  One  provides  the  MDL  based  on  an  ordinary  least  squares\n(OLS)  regression  analysis;  the  other  on  a  weighted  least  squares  (WLS)  based  regression  analysis.  These  two\ncomputational  alternatives  do  not  provide  the  same  MDL.  The  OLS  algorithm  is  appropriate  when  signal\nuncertainty  remains  relatively  constant  over  the  window  of  calibration;  otherwise,  the  WLS  algorithm  is  more\nappropriate. A third alternative allows the use of similar regression-based approaches for MDL determination in the\npresence of a more complex calibration model (e.g., nonlinear, multivariate), or when distributional assumptions of\nthe  other  alternatives  are  not  appropriate.  Many  software  packages  perform  regression  analysis,  and  their  use  is\nrecommended.\n6. 3.2  Statistical Definitions\n6. 3.2.1  Method  detection  limit  (MDL)  \u2014  The  level  at  which  the  errors  in  the  measurement  method  become  large\nenough such that the preset maximum acceptable risk of seeing the quantified level, when none of the contaminant\nin question is present in the sample, is exceeded.\n6. 3.2.2  risk \u2014 This guide uses 0.13% as the maximum acceptable risk. This is the probability of observing a given\nresult  from  a  normal  distribution  that  is  3  or  more  standard  deviations  above  the  average.  Risk  is  set  on  a  per-\ncontaminant basis.\n6. 3.2.3\ncalibration curve \u2014 An estimate of the relationship between concentration and instrument response (signal\nintensity).
