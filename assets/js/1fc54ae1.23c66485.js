The  data  required  in  such\ncases   is   very   dependent   on   equipment   type,   host\ninformation  requirements,  and  alarm  situation.

SPOOL   ACTIVE   has   two   components:\nSPOOL UNLOAD and SPOOL LOAD. These are each\nbroken  into  substates.  A  description  of  all  spooling\nstates,    substates,    and    applicable    state    transitions\nfollows.  The  POWER  OFF  and  POWER  ON  parent\nstates  are  common  to  all  equipment  subsystems.  They\nare  shown  here  to  illustrate  the  retention  of  spooling\ncontext during a power down situation.\nNOTE  20:  Disabling  SECS  communications  does  not  affect\nthe  current  spooling  state  since  no  messages  are  generated\nuntil  communications  are  subsequently  enabled.  Spooling  is\neffectively frozen in this case.\nPOWER OFF\nThe  equipment  has  lost  power  for  any  reason  (e.g.,\npower failure, power switch set to off).\nPOWER ON\nThe equipment is powered up.\nSPOOL INACTIVE\nThis is the normal operating mode. No spooling occurs.\nThe spool area is empty. Primary SECS-II messages are\ntransmitted normally.\nSPOOL ACTIVE\nAll  primary  SECS-II  messages  ready  for  sending  and\nfor which spooling is enabled (see S2,F43) are directed\nto  the  spool  area.  All  other  primary  messages,  except\nStream 1, are discarded. The equipment shall attempt to\nsend  any  secondary  messages  that  are  generated  and\ndiscard these messages should the attempt to send fail.\nSpool  state  transitions  from  SPOOL  INACTIVE  to\nSPOOL  ACTIVE  if  the  communications  state  changes\nfrom    COMMUNICATING    to    NOT    COMMUNI-\nCATING (Communication State Transition Table, #14)\nor     from     WAIT     CRA     to     WAIT     DELAY\n(Communication STATE Transition Table, #6)."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E30-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1992, 2003\n64"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Figure 4.11\nSpooling State Diagram"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Once  communications  are  established,  the  host  must\ninitiate   the   spool   unload   sequence   to   restore   full\nfunctionality  (see  below).  Since  the  equipment  will\ndeliver  secondary  messages,  the  host  may  inquire  for\ninformation or send commands as needed.\nThe   SPOOL   ACTIVE   state   has   two   AND   states:\nSPOOL  LOAD  and  SPOOL  UNLOAD.  This  means\nthat  they  operate  independently,  though  sharing  data\nand  some  state  change  stimuli.  See  Section  3.1  for\nexplanation of state model terms and notation.\nSPOOL LOAD\nThe  SPOOL  LOAD  component  enters  messages  into\nthe spool area. It is divided into two substates: SPOOL\nNOT FULL and SPOOL FULL. SPOOL NOT FULL is\nthe  default  entry  substate  of  the  parent  state  SPOOL\nLOAD.\nSPOOL NOT FULL\nAs primary SECS-II messages are directed to the spool\narea, the equipment shall \u201cwrite\u201d the SECS-II message\nto     the     end     of     the     spool.

Status\nvariable     SpoolCountTotal     shall     be     incremented\nwhenever  a  message  is  submitted  to  the  spool  area.\nStatus variable SpoolCountActual shall be manipulated\nto  keep  an  accurate  count  of  the  number  of  messages\ncontained  in  the  spool  area.  For  example,  if  it  is\nnecessary  to  delete  three  messages  in  the  spool  area  to\nspool   one   message,   SpoolCountActual   would   have\nthree subtracted and then one added to the total.\nOverWriteSpool   is   False:   Any   subsequent   primary\nmessages  shall  be  discarded.  When  such  a  message  is\ndiscarded, SpoolCountTotal is incremented.\nSPOOL UNLOAD\nThe SPOOL UNLOAD component of SPOOLACTIVE\ndeals  with  movement  of  messages  out  of  the  spool.  It\nhas   an   active   substate   (SPOOL   OUTPUT)   and   a\npassive  substate  (NO  SPOOL  OUTPUT).  NO  SPOOL\nOUTPUT   is   the   default   entry   substate,   since   the\nequipment  is  NOT  COMMUNICATING  at  the  time\nspooling  is  initiated.  When  communications  between\nequipment and host are restored, there is an opportunity\nfor  the  host  to  recover  spooled  messages.  No  action  is\ntaken  until  the  host  initiates  the  spool  output  process\nvia  the  S6,F23  (Request  Spooled  Data).  The  host  has\nthe  option  to  either  receive  the  spooled  messages  (see\nsubstate  TRANSMIT  SPOOL)  or  discard  all  messages\nin the spool (see substate PURGE SPOOL).\nNO SPOOL OUTPUT\nIn this state, no messages are removed from the spool.\nSPOOL OUTPUT\nThe  SPOOL  OUTPUT  state  encompasses  the  removal\nof  messages  from  the  spool.  Its  substates  are  TRANS-\nMIT SPOOL and PURGE SPOOL.\nTRANSMIT SPOOL\nThe host elects to receive all messages contained in the\nspool area. The equipment is expected to keep track of\nthe  oldest  record  (i.e.,  message)  within  the  spool  area.\nWhen  communications  are  re-established  with  the  host\nand transmission of the spool area is started, the oldest\nrecord  must  be  the  first  record  transmitted,  then  the\nnext  oldest  record,  etc.  There  is  no  prioritization  of\nmessages to be sent from the spool.\nAs each spooled message is successfully transmitted to\nthe  host,  it  is  removed  from  the  spool  area  upon\nsuccessful    completion    of    the    transaction.

First,  only  one  open  transaction  on  the\nequipment  is  allowed  during  spool  unload.  Thus,  if  a\nmessage  requires  a  reply,  the  equipment  shall  wait  for\nthat reply before transmitting the next spooled message.\nMessages  which  require  no  reply  may  be  transmitted\nsequentially    as    rapidly    as    the    message    transfer\nmechanism will allow.\nThe second flow control method is to allow the host to\nlimit  the  maximum  number  of  messages  sent  from  the\nspool in response to the S6,F23 request. An equipment\nconstant  named  MaxSpoolTransmit  may  be  set  by  the\nhost  to  achieve  this  behavior.  If  MaxSpoolTransmit  is\nset  to  five,  for  example,  the  equipment  will  send  the\nfirst five messages from the spool and then transition to\nthe  NO  SPOOL  OUTPUT  state,  awaiting  the  next\nS6,F23  request.  There  is  no  event  report  generated\nwhen   MaxSpoolTransmit   is   reached.   The   host   is\nresponsible   for   determining   this   situation   by   a)\ncounting  the  messages  received,  b)  timing  out  waiting\nfor the next message, c) inquiring to the equipment for\nthe   curent   value   of   the   SpoolCountActual   status\nvariable,  or  d)  some  combination  of  the  above.  If\nMaxSpool-Transmit  is  set  to  zero,  the  spool  shall  be\ntransmitted completely in response to S6,F23.\nNormal  spooling  continues  during  the  spool  transmit\nprocess.   If   the   SPOOL   LOAD   component   should\ntransi-tion to SPOOL FULL, it shall not have any effect\non  the  SPOOL  UNLOAD  component.  Once  full,  the\nspool cannot make the transition back to SPOOL NOT\nFULL  except  via  the  SPOOL  INACTIVE  state.  Space\nmade  available  due  to  the  spool  unload  process  shall\nnot be used in this case.\nWhen  a  multi-block  message  is  to  be  transmitted  from\nthe  spool,  any  required  inquire/grant  transaction  shall\nbe initiated. If the host\u2019s response denies permission to\nsend the multi-block message, the equipment shall dis-\ncard  that  message  and  continue  with  the  transmit  pro-\ncess.  This  sequence  shall  count  as  one  message  in  the\nMaxSpoolTransmit count.\nThere  is  one  area  where  SPOOL  LOAD  and  SPOOL\nUNLOAD  may  interact:  When  the  spool  is  full  and\nOverWriteSpool is True. During the spool transmit pro-\ncess, spooled messages are being removed and new pri-\nmary  messages  are  being  written  to  the  spool.  These\nnew  messages  are  overwriting  the  oldest  messages\navailable, unless the unload process has freed sufficient\nspool  space.  There  is  a  possibility  that  the  unload  and\noverwrite  processes  may  compete  for  control  of  the\nsame  message  area.  For  example,  if  the  spool  holds\nmessages  ABCDE,  with  A  oldest  and  E  newest,  A\nmight  be  sent  to  the  host,  B  (and  the  space  from  A)\noverwritten by the new message F, C sent to the host, D\nand  E  (and  the  space  from  message  C)  overwritten  by\nG,  etc.  The  loss  of  continuity  may  be  \u201cdisorienting\u201d  to\nthe host program receiving the messages. It is expected\nthat  the  unload  process  will  be  fast  relative  to  the\ngeneration  of  new  messages,  so  that  this  occurrence\nwill be rare.\nShould a communication failure occur during the spool\ntransmit  process,  spooling  shall  continue  as  before  the\ntransmit  process  began.
