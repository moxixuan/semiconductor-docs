Bottom View of FOSB

5. 14  Retaining  Features  — Figure 13 and 14 show two features on the bottom of the FOSB that may be used for
retaining  the  FOSB  onto  the  kinematic  couplings.  Retaining  features  are  option  for  the  FOSB  with  manual  door,
however those are required for the FOSB with automated-shippable door. This may be needed to prevent the FOSB
from  being  knocked  off  the  kinematic  couplings  by  the  action  of  pushing  the  FOSB  against  the  front-opening
interface.  The  front  retaining  feature  contains  a  ramp  that  a  wheel  might  roll  up  while  the  FOSB  is  being  pushed
toward the front-opening interface. The arm with the wheel (not specified here) then holds the FOSB down on the
kinematic couplings. The center retaining feature consists of an oblong slot with a chamber above it. The FOSB can
be clamped onto the kinematic couplings by inserting an oblong head on a shaft (not specified here) through the slot
and rotating it 90° in either direction. Either retaining feature would only engage after the FOSB is fully seated on
the kinematic coupling pins. Either retaining feature must be able to withstand a force in any direction of at least f60.
It is recommended that SEMI E15.1 tool load ports be designed to accommodate the minimum hole dimensions of
the  retaining  features  to  ensure  carrier  interchangeability.  Projections  on  the  tool  load  ports  that  mate  with  the
retaining features should also not interfere with the misalignment correction function of the kinematic couplings.
5. 15  Sensing Pads — As shown in Figure 12, when the FOSB is fully down on the kinematic coupling, the carrier
sensing  pads  must  be  z2  above  horizontal  datum  plane.  It  is  recommended  that  the  areas  surrounding  all  of  the
carrier  sensing  pads  be  designed  in  conjunction  with  the  features  that  mate  with  kinematic  coupling  pins  so  that  a
mechanical  sensor  pin  cannot  interfere  with  the  lead-in  function  of  the  kinematic  couplings.  Other  sensing  pads
(called info pads and given letter names) communicate information about the carrier. Note that since this is a bottom


SEMI M31-0705 © SEMI 1998, 2005 15
view,  the  positions  of  sensors  on  a  load  port  will  be  switched,  with  the  sensor  for  info  pad  A  on  the  right  and  the
sensor for info pad B on the left as one faces the tool from the front.  Table 3 defines all dimensions.

APPLICATION NOTES
NOTICE:  This  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  M31  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot  procedures  on
July 15, 1999.
A1-1  Although  FOSB  parameters  supporting  effective  reuse  and cleaning (washing/drying) are not defined in this
document, it is essential that these capabilities be considered for a successful overall shipping box design.
A1-2  It  is  important  to  note  that  shipping  boxes  containing  wafers  are  typically  bagged  for  shipment  to  the  IC
manufacturer.  It  is  therefore  important  to  design  the  outer  surfaces  of  the  shipping  box  to  be  compatible  with  this
common practice.
A1-3  Information about Automated-shippable Door
A1-3.1  When Automated-shippable door is used, the following contents should be understood for wafer quality.
A1-3.2  Rear  of  Door  (y51):  Increasing  the  value  of  y51,  might  have  impact  to  the  capability  for  absorbing  drop
shock and wafer rotation during transportation, especially for x-direction since decreasing the area of holding wafer
by front wafer retainer.
A1-4  Items which need to be considered for automated-shippable door closing and opening process:
A1-4.1  When close or open the automated-shippable door by SEMI E62 compliant load port, not only SEMI E62
defined f30 and f34, but also consideration of other factors which may not be defined by SEMI E62, such as speed,
acceleration and deceleration of door closing and opening, are needed.
A1-4.2  Excessive f34 may cause deformation of the box, as well as breakage of wafers which are contained in the
box.  Door  may  be  closed  with  lesser  f34  by  deploying  designs  which  utilize  door  and  box  related  forces,  such  as
latch key torque.
A1-4.3  It needs to be considered that door may rebound at door opening process.
A1-4.4  Retaining features force (f61): It is noted that strong clamping force may produce plastic deformation.

GUIDE TO STATISTICAL SPECIFICATIONS
This guide was technically reapproved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  reapproved  by  the  North  American
Regional  Standards  Committee  on  March  14,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  May  2004;  to  be
published July 2004. Originally published September 1998.
1  Purpose
1. 1          Specifications     are     based     on     requirements
negotiated  between  trading  partners.  This  document
describes an explicit specification form that defines the
risk  level  as  a  part  of  parametric  specifications.  This
approach  uses  process  capability  information  to  focus
quality   improvement   efforts,   reduce   sampling,   and
maintain low risks. It is based on the fundamental belief
that   specifications   should   facilitate   the   movement
toward   processed-in   quality   instead   of   inspected-in
quality.
1. 2        It    is    important    for    users    and    suppliers    to
acknowledge  and  mutually  agree  on  quality  levels  so
the  methods  employed  will  satisfy  their  expectations.
Statistical  specifications  provide  a  convenient  way  to
do this.
1. 3    Statistical  specifications  are  designed  to  facilitate
the  movement  toward  processed-in  quality.  They  are
most    appropriate    for    processes    that    have    been
statistically  characterized.  This  means  the  shape  of  the
statistical distribution that created the product is known,
or  can  be  approximated  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  user
and  the  supplier.  It  also  implies  that  the  statistical
control of the process and the measurement systems are
defined to the level that is necessary to meet the current
needs.
2  Scope
2. 1    This  guide  may  be  used  when  changing  or  adding
specifications to SEMI M18.
2. 2  Statistical  specifications apply  to  all  processes  that
have   been   statistically   characterized.   Solutions   are
given  for  two  product  distribution  shapes  (normal  &
lognormal),  and  the  advantages  of  these  solutions  are
explained.    Appendix    3    shows    the    statistically
characterized  shape  for  many  common  silicon  wafer
processes.
2. 3      This   guide   applies   to   processes   related   to   the
production  and  use  of  silicon  wafers.  It  may  also  be
applied to the production and use of other materials.
2. 4  This approach implies that the quality level shipped
is the same as the quality level produced.
2. 5    This  methodology  can  be  an  effective  tool  for
driving quality improvement.
2. 6        This    procedure    can    be    coupled    with    other
techniques  for  centering  the  mean  and  reducing  the
variation  within  the  process  distribution  as  deemed
necessary by the user and supplier.
2. 7    Appendix  4  further  explains  the  rationale  for  this
approach.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

6  Solutions
6. 1          The     following     are     examples     of     statistical
specifications for normal and lognormal distributions.
6. 1.1  Normal   ó   The   normal   distribution   describes
processes   that   target   a   specific   value   and   have
symmetric  random  variation  about  that  value.  The  first
portion  of  the  normal  statistical  specification  is  the
familiar  tolerance.  It  uses  an  upper  specification  limit
(USL)  and  a  lower  specification  limit  (LSL),  or  the
target  plus  and/or  minus  a  value.  The  second  portion,
after  the  @  sign  below,  is  a  measure  of  the  quality
level, in ppm.
LSL to USL @ yy ppm, or
Target ± xx @ yy ppm

6. 1.2  Lognormal  ó  The  lognormal  function  describes
many    of    the    one-sided    distributions    that    are
encountered  in  the  silicon  industry.  It  applies  to  those
parameters  such  as  flatness  and  warp  that  are  bounded
by   zero.   For   lognormal   processes,   the   value   of   a
parameter could be specified as:
≤xx @ yy ppm

6. 2    More  details,  and  examples  of  use,  are  shown  in
Appendix 1 for normal applications and Appendix 2 for
lognormal applications.
6. 3    For  process  distributions  not  following  normal  or
lognormal forms, Pearson or other distributions may be
used.

APPENDIX 1
USING STATISTICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR NORMAL PROCESSES
NOTICE: This appendix was approved as an official part of SEMI M32 by full letter ballot procedure.
A1-1  Statistical Specification Format for
Normal Distributions
A1-1.1  The normal distribution is quite well-known. It
describes processes that target a specific value and have
symmetric  random  variation  about  that  value.  Below
are  examples  of  statistical  specifications  for  normal
processes.  The  first  portion  is  the  familiar  tolerance,
and the second portion is a measure of the quality level.
LSL to USL @ yy ppm, or
Target ± xx @ yy ppm

Other     standard     tolerance     definitions     could     be
substituted, or other definitions of the quality level such
as Cpk, Z-value, or percent could be used.
A1-1.2    Adding  the  quality  level  removes  the  potential
for misunderstanding and makes the specification more
meaningful.
A1-2  Example of Use
A1-2.1          Functionally,     statistical     specifications     are
similar   to   conventional   tolerances,   except   that   the
quality level is stated rather than just implied. They can
be  directly  substituted  for  tolerances  or  other  forms  of
specifications.  Statistical  specifications  are  especially
useful    for    focusing    quality    improvement    efforts,
achieving     ship-to-stock     relationships,     promoting
processed   in   quality,   and   reducing   after   the   fact
inspection.  In  this  environment  they  could  be  used  as
follows:
A1-2.1.1    Through  audits  and  capability  reporting  a
particular  parameter  is  targeted  for  improvement  or
chosen as a ship-to-stock candidate.
A1-2.1.2    The  control  methods,  distribution  shape,  and
statistical  specification  are  agreed  upon.  The  tolerance
and  quality  level  defined  in  the  statistical  specification
completely define the needed process capability.
A1-2.1.3    Once  it  is  shown  that  the  required  capability
is   consistently   exceeded   then   reduced   inspection
sampling  can  be  implemented  without  increasing  the
risk to the customer or supplier. In this way the process
controls   can   gradually   become   the   guarantee   for
quality,  and  after  the  fact  inspection  can  be  gradually
reduced  to  the  level  that  is  needed  for  outgoing  quality
reporting.
A1-3  Discussion
A1-3.1      Statistical   specifications   remove   ambiguity,
allow  small  risks,  and  promote  the  movement  toward
better process controls and less after the fact inspection.
The   quality   level   (i.e.,   the   yy   portion)   is   often
misunderstood.  Some  people  say  they  want  ppm  level
quality  but  introduce  methods  that  allow  50,000  to
200,000 ppm in error. This causes confusion.
A1-3.2      Many   people   have   the   misconception   that
tolerances  are  goal  posts  that  require  100%  of  the
material  to  fall  inside.  Processes  are  usually  described
by  statistical  distributions,  so  specifications  have  little
meaning  if  a  quality  level  is  not  defined.  For  many
years,  99.73%  (i.e.,  ±  3  sigma)  was  considered  to  be
satisfactory.   ìWithin   toleranceî   was   understood   to
mean  within  tolerance  with  a  99.73%  confidence,  or  a
0. 27%  quality  level.  Later  the  99.73%  process  was
defined  as  ìcruelî.  0.27%  was  no  longer  an  acceptable
quality level, and process drift was understood to cause
even  higher  reject  rates.  This  led  to  the  demand  for
better  process  capabilities  (i.e.,  higher  Cpkís),  which
demanded   corresponding   improvements   in   process
characterization   and   control   methodologies.   At   the
same  time  other  users  tightened  their  tolerances  to  the
point that led to over-control. Either extreme can cause
a mismatch between expectations and capabilities if the
risks are not carefully evaluated.
A1-3.3    Capability-based  sampling  is  perhaps  the  only
way   to   rigorously   transfer   from   inspection-based
quality    to    process    control-based    quality,    without
incurring high risks. Statistical specifications create the
environment  for  this  to  work.  Once  the  specification  is
clearly  defined,  it  can  be  clearly  achieved.  The  details
of  capability  based  sampling  are  beyond  the  scope  of
this   document,   but   the   basic   concept   is   easy   to
understand. If a process is very capable and controlled,
then   the   system   can   be   relied   upon   to   create   the
necessary   quality   level   with   less   after   the   fact
inspection.  This  is  good  for  both  sides.  Users  get  more
reliable   quality,   and   suppliers   get   the   information
needed to focus quality improvement efforts and direct
resources at the most critical processes.



SEMI M32-0998 © SEMI 1998, 2004 4
A1-3.4          Once     a     process     has     been     statistically
characterized,    everything    becomes    much    easier.
Calculations  can  be  done  in  milliseconds  instead  of
minutes.  This  includes  spec  acceptance,  comparisons,
and many forms of analysis. Multiple levels like % < A,
%  <  B,  and  %  <  C  are  also  clearly  unnecessary  if  the
distribution  shape  is  known.  This  prevents  a  large
amount of duplicate work.

APPENDIX 2
USING STATISTICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR LOGNORMAL
PROCESSES
NOTICE: This appendix was approved as an official part of SEMI M32 by full letter ballot procedure.
A2-1  Statistical Specification Format for
Lognormal Distributions
A2-1.1  The lognormal probability distribution function
describes    many    of    the    one-sided    distributions
encountered  in  the  silicon  industry.  It  applies  to  those
one-sided  parameters  like  flatness  and  warp  that  are
bounded  by  zero.  Below  is  an  example  of  a  statistical
specification for a lognormal process.
≤ xx @ yy ppm

A2-1.2    Other  standard  tolerance  definitions  could  be
substituted,  or  other  quality  level  definitions  such  as
ECPK, Z-value, or percent could be used. Again, ECPK
is  the  Equivalent  normal  Cpk  that  corrects  for  non-
normality.  More  information  on  the  Equivalent  Cpk  is
shown at the end of this appendix.
A2-1.3    As  with  the  normal  distribution,  adding  the
quality       level       removes       the       potential       for
misunderstanding  and  makes  the  specification  more
meaningful.
A2-2  Example of Use
A2-2.1  Again, the major objectives are to focus quality
improvement        efforts,        achieve        ship-to-stock
relationships, promote processed in quality, and reduce
after  the  fact  inspection.  The  steps  are  the  same  as
shown in Section A1-2 for the normal distribution. The
major  difference  is  that  only  the  upper  tail  needs  to  be
considered.  However,  since  the  lognormal  tail  goes  so
much farther out, it might be necessary to accept a less
critical quality level.
A2-3  Discussion
A2-3.1    Statistical  specifications  work  very  well  for
processes  with  lognormal  distributions.  They  have  all
the  benefits  described  for  normal  distributions,  and  in
some  respects,  they  are  even  easier.  Since  lognormal
processes  only  have  one  tail,  checking  each  tail  to
decide which is the most critical is not necessary. Also,
it   has   been   empirically   observed   that   lognormal
processes are not as prone to mean drifting, so they tend
to  be  more  stable.  The  main  hurdle  is  realizing  how
much  error  is  introduced  if  the  distribution  shape  is
assumed to be normal when it is not.
A2-3.1.1  Figure A2-1 illustrates the difference between
a lognormal and a normal process. The curve which has
a  solid  line  (and  is  clearly  not  symmetrical)  is  the
lognormal  distribution.  The  curve  with  the  dashed  line
is  the  normal  distribution.  The  error  when  mistakenly
using a normal distribution to characterize a lognormal
process   is   shown   in   Table   A2-1.   For   values   that
increment  by  1  sigma  from  the  mean,  the  ppm  greater
than   that   value   is   given   for   each   curve,   and   the
difference  (or  error)  is  calculated.  To  make  it  easier  to
visualize,  increments  of  the  simple  normal  mean  and
sigma  (1.8263  and  0.7568  respectively)  are  used  in  the
ìvalueî column. For calculating the lognormal statistics
the  correct  lognormal  geometric  mean  of  1.8258  and
the lognormal geometric sigma of 0.7550 are used. The
error  between  the  curves  increases  as  the  point  of
interest moves toward the center of the distribution, but
the  most  important  issue  is  the  length  of  the  tail.  The
right  tail  of  the  lognormal  distribution  extends  along
with the histogram, but the normal distribution is much
shorter.  Visually,  the  significance  might  be  overlooked
in  Figure  A2-1,  but  when  the  tail  probabilities  are
shown  in  ppm  (Table  A2-1)  the  difference  is  very
apparent.

A2-3.2        Lognormal    distributions    can    be    handled
mathematically  as  easily  as  normal  distributions,  if  the
formulas are known. The difficulty in the past was that
many  of  the  calculations  developed  for  the  normal
distribution   were   not   available   for   lognormal.   The
equivalent   normal   Cpk   (ECPK)   was   developed   to
address   this   issue.   For   the   lognormal   distribution,
ECPK  is  calculated  as  shown  below.  It  is  an  exact
mathematical    derivation    with    no    estimations    or
assumptions. It was designed to allow people to see real
data   and   keep   all   transformations   and   conversions
inside  the  computer  where  they  are  totally  invisible.
Two  cases  are  presented.  Section  A2-3.3  describes  the
case   where   a   statistical   software   is   available,   and
Section  A2-3.4  describes  a  shortcut  that  may  be  used
when  the  computation  is  derived  from  scratch.  In  both
cases,   it   is   important   to   remember   that   only   the
computer will see these formulas.
A2-3.3        Statistical    software    packages    will    usually
output the geometric mean and geometric sigma. If μ is
the lognormal geometric mean, σ is the lognormal geo-
metric  sigma,  and  1n  is  the  natural  log  function,  then
ECPK is calculated as:
ECPK=
1n [USL]−1n

For   the   example   in   Figure   A2-1   the   lognormal
geometric  mean  is  1.826  and  the  lognormal  geometric
sigma  is  0.755.  If  an  upper  spec  limit  (USL)  of  6  is
applied,  then  the  ECPK  is  1.06.  This  will  usually  be
done  in  a  computer.  A  programming  version  of  this
formula is written as:
ECPK= ((log (USL))−log (Gmean**2 / (sqrt
(Gmean **2 + Gsigma * *2)))) / (3 * sqrt (log
((Gmean * *2 + Gsigma * *2) / Gmean * *2)))

A2-3.4  If the computation is programmed from scratch
for  raw  data,  it  may  be  convenient  to  take  the  natural
log  of  each  data  point  (i.e.,  do  a  log  transformation)
then   compute   the   mean   of   the   transformed   data
(Tmean)  and  sigma  of  the  transformed  data  (Tsigma).
Again,  ln  is  the  natural  log  function.  In  this  case,  the
ECPK formula can be written as:
ECPK= (1n(USL)−Tmean)/(3* Tsigma)

The geometric mean and geometric sigma could then be
calculated as follows:
Gmean= exp(Tmean+ (Tsigma* *2)/2)
Gsigma = sqrt((exp((2 * Tmean) + (Tsigma * *2))) *
(exp((Tsigma * *2))−1))

A2-4  Conclusion
Lognormal   calculations   can   be   as   easy   as   normal
calculations.  Again,  the  formulas  reside  only  in  the
computer  where  they  are  never  seen  by  the  user.  They
allow  the  user  to  view  the  actual  measures  and  the
actual distributions.

APPENDIX 4
RATIONALE FOR STATISTICAL SPECIFICATIONS
NOTICE: This appendix was approved as an official part of SEMI M32 by full letter ballot procedure.
A4-1  Introduction
A4-1.1    The  purpose  of  a  specification   is   either   to
define   acceptance   criteria   or   to   assist   in   quality
improvement  planning.  The  basic  intent  is  to  quantify
user  need  so  suppliers  can  accommodate  that  need.
Developing  a  clear  link  between  user  needs  and  the
control  methods  used  on  the  production  floor  is  one  of
the  most  critical  steps  for  creating  a  Total  Quality
Management  (TQM)  environment.  Following  are  some
key   background   concepts   that   allow   the   reader   to
understand the conclusions drawn in this document.
A4-1.2    For  most  manufacturing  processes  there  is  no
such thing as ìzero defectsî. Processes are described by
statistical probability distributions, and the tails of these
functions can go all the way to infinity. For many years,
99. 73%  (i.e.,  ±  3  sigma)  was  used  as  the  basis  for
tolerances. ìWithin toleranceî was understood to mean
within tolerance with a 99.73% confidence, or a 0.27%
quality  level.  When  users  requested  better  levels,  then
new  standards  such  as  33  ppm  or  3.4  ppm  were  made.
In  any  case,  this  quality  level  needs  to  be  agreed  upon
for  a  specification  method  to  have  meaning.  It  can  be
measured in terms of ppm, Z, Cpk (which is equal to Z
divided by 3), or percent. Z tables or Cpk tables can be
obtained which provide this information.
A4-1.3    Errors  in  the  10%  or  higher  range  can  be
generated  if  a  percentile  specification  is  based  on  the
central portion of the distribution. An example of such a
specification  is  ì50%  ≤  1.2  micronsî.  These  errors  are
not   obvious   and   require   careful   statistical   analysis
based  upon  real  process  variation.  Multiple  percentile
specifications are also difficult to apply. Paragraph A4-
3 provides more details on these issues.
A4-1.4    Conversely,  if  specifications  get  too  far  out  on
the  tail,  they  tend  to  become  abstract  and  are  not  used
as  the  primary  factor  driving  quality  improvements.
This  is  especially  true  for  non-normal  processes  where
the  tail  of  the  distribution  goes  out  much  farther  than
expected   from   a   normal   distribution.   Figure   A4-1
shows  where  a  3.4  ppm  specification  would  be  on  a
lognormal  process.  Users  usually  will  not  allow  that
much   tolerance.   However,   if   the   specification   is
tightened   while   the   process   capability   remains   the
same,  then  the  consequence  is  a  degradation  in  the
quality level.

A4-1.5    The  mean  and  sigma  specification  is  another
proposed  approach.  Intuitively,  this  seems  promising,
but  it  has  many  of  the  same  problems  as  multiple
percentile   specifications.   More   details   are   given   in
Paragraph A4-4.
A4-1.6    Errors  in  the  5%  to  10%  range  can  also  be
generated  if  process  distributions  are  assumed  to  be
normal   when   they   are   not.   Knowing   the   actual
distribution  shape  is  a  key  factor  that  opens  up  a
tremendous  amount  of  knowledge.  Figure  A4-2  shows
an  example  of  real  data  that  illustrates  a  lognormal
process.  In  the  past,  this  was  considered  to  be  difficult
because  non-normal  distributions  were  only  supported
by     high-level     statistical     software.     Now     even
spreadsheets  have  them.  It  should  also  be  noted  that
once  the  process  characterization  has  been  done,  the
shape  of  the  distribution  typically  does  not  change,  so
this  knowledge  can  be  shared  throughout  the  industry.
Regularly  monitoring  the  process  by  overlaying  the
distribution  on  the  process  histogram  or  cumulative
frequency plot is extremely valuable to confirm that the
process  is  not  taking  on  unnatural  bimodal  or  outlier
effects.  One-sided  distributions  such  as  flatness  and
warp   are   so   well-characterized   by   the   lognormal
distribution that ìgoodness-of-fitî results are very close
to  100%.  Again,  the  error  gets  larger  as  the  point-of
interest  moves  toward  the  ìcenterî  of  the  distribution,
but  the  major  concern  is  the  length  of  the  tail.  The
lognormal distribution in Figure A4-2 (the curve with a
solid  line  which  is  clearly  not  symmetrical)  has  a  tail
that  extends  much  farther  to  the  right  than  the  normal
distribution  which  is  shown  with  a  dashed  line.  This
effect,  and  the  impact,  is  shown  in  more  detail  in
Appendix 2.

Normal vs. Lognormal Shape
A4-1.7    Statistical  specifications  quantify  the  quality
level   so   it   is   not   an   abstract   assumption   left   to
conjecture.  This  allows  both  the  user  and  supplier  to
optimize  their  control  systems  to  that  level.  Capability
based sampling is one example. Simply put, this means
to use process capability information to help define the
sampling  plan  for  a  process.  A  detailed  discussion  of
this  subject  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  document,  but
the  basic  concept  is  easy  to  understand.  If  a  process  is
very  capable  and  controlled  it  does  not  need  as  much
sampling  as  one  that  is  not.  Implementing  this  strategy
is a big step ahead of standard sampling theory. It might
be  the  only  way  to  rigorously  transfer  from  inspection
based  quality  to  process  control  based  quality,  without
incurring high risks. Statistical specifications create the
environment  which  facilitates  this  improved  strategy.
Hopefully, the quality levels would be defined in ppm,
but  any  level  agreed  upon  by  both  the  user  and  the
supplier would work.
A4-2  Tolerance Specifications
LSL to USL, or Target ± xx

A4-2.1        The    main    problem    with    a    conventional
tolerance is that many people perceive it as a goal post
that  requires  100%  of  the  material  to  fall  inside.  This
document  has  shown  in  detail  that  this  is  simply  a
wrong   perception.   Stating   the   quality   level   in   the
specification,  instead  of  just  implying  it,  corrects  this
problem.
A4-2.2        Another    common    misconception    is    that
tolerances  and  tail  probabilities  divert  attention  away
from  centering  the  process.  Of  course,  centering  is
important. Considering the impact of poor quality on all
customers, it is clear that a well centered process is far
more  efficient  than  one  that  is  not.  It  is  also  generally
true    that    the    suitability    of    the    product    is    not
significantly  different  immediately  on  one  side  of  a
tolerance  line  compared  to  the  other.  However,  there
are a number of issues that warrant discussion.
A4-2.2.1    First,  centering  is  usually  not  difficult,  so  it
usually does not need a major emphasis. Those who are
experienced  in  quality  improvement  techniques  would
certainly   not   forget   to   center   the   process.   Simply
monitoring  the  mean  trend  gives  an  excellent  measure
of  centering,  and  it  keeps  the  focus  on  the  process
rather  than  the  specification.  Industry  carries  a  long
history where specifications prevented the attainment of
good  process  control.  Many  of  the  issues  have  been
explained   earlier   in   this   document.   To   summarize,
process  controls  are  the  only  way  to  truly  maintain  a
centered  process,  and  these  controls  can  only  work  if
there   is   enough   tolerance   in   the   specification   to
accommodate  the  sensitivity  limitations  of  the  control
methods.
A4-2.2.2    The  second  issue  is  that  it  might  not  be
possible  to  center.  This  is  clearly  the  case  in  one-sided
processes   that   are   bounded   by   zero.   Optimizing
multiple   parameters   might   also   dictate   that   some
parameters get worse.
A4-2.2.3    The  final,  and  most  important,  issue  is  the
challenge  of  teaching  statistical  methods  to  the  factory
population.   It   is   very   easy   to   teach   averages   and
centering since they tend to be well understood already.
It  is  not  as  easy  to  teach  sigma  and  the  fact  that  sigma
trends  must  be  thoroughly  understood  before  much  of
anything  can  be  said  about  averages.  Confirming  that
the  R  or  S  chart  is  controlled  before  studying  the  Xbar
chart  and  doing  an  F-test  before  doing  a  t-test  are  just
two  examples.  These  are  very  important  concepts  that
must  be  fully  understood  in  order  to  apply  statistical
methods. Over-stressing centering de-emphasizes sigma
and creates an environment where it is not appreciated.
Thinking  in  terms  of  sigma  is  the  most  important
concept   that   most   people   will   learn   about   process
control methods. It deserves a major emphasis.
A4-2.2.4    Of  course,  centering  would  be  a  concern  if
mixing  and  matching  of  lots  is  the  control  method,  but
this    can    be    easily    spotted    in    the    statistical
characterization  process.  The  fact  that  some  of  the
alternatives to tolerances are much more likely to cause
this practice will be further explained in Paragraphs A4-
3 and A4-4.
A4-3  Multiple Distributional Percentile
Specifications
%≤A,  %≤B,  and %≤C

A4-3.1    Errors  in  the  10%  or  higher  range  can  be
generated if a specification in the central portion of the
distribution is used. An example of such a specification
is ì50% ≤ 1.2 micronsî.



SEMI M32-0998 © SEMI 1998, 2004 10
A4-3.2  No control method can hold a process perfectly
still. Even the best real-time control methods can allow
a  process  to  drift  as  much  as  ±  1.5  sigma.  For  this
reason,  a  6-sigma  design  was  defined  as  4.5  sigma  to
the nearest tolerance.
A4-3.3    Sampling  issues  are  a  major  concern.  Many
kinds   of   variation   can   be   quantified   by   rigorously
studying   the   appropriate   samplings   (within   batch
samples  for  batch-to-batch  variation,  monthly  samples
for month-to-month variation, etc.). However, there are
practical  limits  on  how  many  kinds  of  variation  can  be
continuously  monitored.  There  is  a  large  amount  of
work  involved,  and  there  are  hundreds  of  potential
sources  of  variation.  Resource  restrictions  regularly
force   suppliers   to   concentrate   on   the   known   key
variables  and  leave  the  rest  as  error  in  the  system  (at
least  for  now).  As  sample  periods  get  longer,  there  is
more  statistical  sensitivity,  but  also  more  probability
that   the   drift   will   be   confounded   with   user-driven
process  improvements.  For  example,  month-to-month
random  drift  is  hard  to  quantify  because  production
processes  are  often  improved  before  many  months  of
data  can  be  observed.  Measurement  error  is  another
main  contributor  which  further  complicates  the  other
sensitivity  issues.  These  factors  all  combine  to  allow  a
certain   amount   of   undetectable   process   drift.   This
process  drift  needs  to  be  considered  when  defining  the
specification approach.
A4-3.4  These variations cannot be detected because of
statistical  sensitivity  limitations.  Table  A4-1  shows  the
sample sizes needed to detect different levels of process
shift.  Delta  will  be  defined  as  the  number  of  sigma  of
undetectable mean drift. For simplicity, a one-way shift
is shown, but in most practical cases, the shift could go
plus  or  minus.  Using  the  old  standard  of  5%  supplier
risk and 10% user risk, 72 samples are needed to detect
a  delta  of  0.25  sigma.  This  example  (0.25  sigma  of
mean  drift)  has  been  used  throughout  this  document.
Since most of the discussion will relate to process drift,
the     terms     ìdriftî     and     ìshiftî     will     be     used
interchangeably. Clearly, 72 is too large a sampling for
most   real-time   control   systems,   but   it   is   still   an
understatement  of  the  problem.  Most  users  currently
expect their risk to be much smaller than 10%. The last
row shows that the sample size would need to be 311 to
reach  0.1%  user  and  supplier  risks.  It  is  generally
agreed  that  0.1%  (i.e.,  1000  ppm)  is  the  lowest  level
that  is  feasible  using  standard  probability  theory.  For
lower  levels,  it  is  necessary  to  move  farther  out  on  the
distribution  tails  where  it  is  necessary  to  rely  on  more
than just stndard sampling probabilities.

A4-3.5    Figures  A4-3,  A4-4,  and  A4-5  show  the  error
generated  by  0.25  sigma  of  undetectable  mean  drift.
Again, the number of sigma of undetectable mean drift
will be defined as delta. Notice how the error grows as
the  point  of  interest  moves  toward  the  center  of  the
distribution.  At  the  four  sigma  point  (out  on  the  tail)
there  is  very  little  error,  so  suppliers  can  be  generous
with  internal  buffer  specifications  to  protect  the  user.
This  is  not  as  feasible  in  the  center  of  the  distribution
because there is so much material at stake. A percentile
specification  in  the  center  of  the  process  shown  would
have  about  1000  times  more  undetected,  out-of-spec
product than a specification at the 4 sigma point. Since
the  shift  could  go  either  way,  this  could  also  be  1000
times  more  material  that  was  rejected  and  should  not
have been.

below  the  specification  for  the  distribution  that  has
drifted.  The  error,  shown  by  the  area  between  the
vertical  lines  and  below  the  right  curve,  is  9.87%  or
98,700 ppm.

Percentage Error
A4-3.10    Please  note  that  this  is  a  very  conservative
example. The delta and the resulting error can get much
larger.
A4-3.11    A  major  concern  is  what  to  do  when  the
specification is not met. Users would certainly not want
suppliers   to   reject   material   in   the   center   of   the
distribution.  Alternatives  are  to  (1)  reject  the  whole
shipment, (2) reject nearby lots, (3) mix and match lots,
or (4) translate the percentage hypothetically lost in the
center  back  out  to  the  tail  in  order  to  reject  the  worst
material.  The  first  two  alternatives  are  really  more  like
penalties  and  would  lead  to  unnecessary  loss  of  good
material.  The  third  is  the  worst  form  of  inspecting  in
quality. It is generally agreed that this is the main thing
to   avoid.   Translating   the   error   back   to   the   tail   is
possible  but  not  necessarily  a  good  approach.  This
would  involve  translating  a  reject  percentage  with  a
large  potential  error  back  out  to  a  region  that  would
have  had  a  very  small  error.  A  multiple  percentile
specification  can  also  be  quite  difficult  in  a  production
environment.  Each  of  the  percentile  criteria  must  be
evaluated  to  determine  which  one  requires  the  highest
reject rate. That reject rate must then be translated back
to  the  tail,  and  100%  sample  data  must  be  used  to
determine which actual pieces to reject. If the statistical
distribution is defined, one specification would give the
same  amount  of  information  with  much  less  work.  If
only  one  criterion  is  used,  and  it  is  well  out  on  the  tail
(hopefully  in  the  ppm  range)  then  this  method  is  very
similar to a statistical specification.
A4-3.12  A commonly stated goal of multiple percentile
specifications   is   to   focus   on   centering   rather   than
distribution  tails.  All  of  the  discussion  in  Section  A4-
2. 2  concerning  centering  is  equally  applicable  here.
Multiple  percentile  specifications  are  more  likely  to
cause  inspected-in  quality  which  detracts  from  process
control based centering.
A4-3.13    Ease  of  use  is  another  stated  goal,  but  for  all
of  the  reasons  stated  above,  this  method  is  one  of  the
most  difficult  to  use.  Statistical  calculations  can  be
done   in   milliseconds   while   the   potential   of   large
samplings,  raw  data  manipulation,  and  duplicate  effort
associated    with    multiple    distributional    percentile
specifications  create  much  more  work.  Characterizing
with percentiles is an alternative for processes that have
not  yet  been  statistically  characterized,  but  once  that
hurdle is crossed, everything gets many times easier.

A4-4.1      First,   please   note   that   the   term   ìsigmaî   is
intentionally  used,  rather  than  ìstandard  deviationî.
This   does   not   in   any   way   imply   100%   sampling.
Instead,  the  implication  is  that  the  process  would  need
to be monitored long enough to understand the ìprocess
sigmaî  (i.e.,  the  state  at  which  the  process  can  be
controlled).
A4-4.2  Mean and sigma specifications intuitively seem
very   promising,   but   they   have   many   of   the   same
problems     as     multiple     distributional     percentile
specifications. Here, the issue of statistical sensitivity is
particularly  important.  Table  A4-1,  and  the  discussion
in  Section  A4-3.4  concerning  sampling  requirements,
explain  the  central  issue.  The  sample  sizes  required  to
detect  smaller  mean  shifts  are  very  large,  so  they
usually are not feasible at the process control point. As
a  result,  mean  and  sigma  specifications  could  lead  to
much  more  sampling  in  an  inspection  area  or  in  the
warehouse,  where  larger  quantities  are  available.  To
keep  the  sample  sizes  small,  it  is  necessary  to  allow  a
specified amount of process drift. Therefore, some form
of tolerance is necessary.
A4-4.3    Another  factor  that  needs  careful  consideration
is the movement toward controlling surrogate variables
instead of outgoing parameters. Many types of variation
can be controlled by carefully applying the appropriate
samplings   (within   batch   samples   for   batch-to-batch
variation,  within  lot  samples  for  lot-to-lot  variation,
etc.).  However,  there  are  practical  limitations  on  how
many types of variation can be continuously monitored.
There is a large amount of work involved, and there are
hundreds  of  potential  sources  of  variation.  Resource
restrictions  regularly  force  suppliers  to  concentrate  on
the  known  key  variables  and  leave  the  rest  as  error  in
the  system  (at  least  for  now).  This  practice,  called
homogeneous  sampling,  is  designed  to  continuously
home  in  on  the  variables  that  have  the  greatest  impact
on the distribution. Strictly speaking, for characterizing
process  capability,  a  random  and  over-time  sampling
which covers all sources of variation should be used. In
practice, this is difficult to do, so engineering judgment
is  needed  to  select  the  most  appropriate  homogeneous
sampling.  This  is  yet  another  issue  that  could  generate
significant errors if it is not fully understood.
A4-4.4      From   an   ease-of-use   standpoint,   mean   and
sigma  specifications  have  many  of  the  same  issues  as
multiple distributional percentile specifications. Mixing
and matching of lots would be especially tempting with
this  approach  because  it  might  be  the  only  practical
alternative.

TEST METHOD FOR THE DETERMINATION OF RESIDUAL SURFACE
CONTAMINATION ON SILICON WAFERS BY MEANS OF TOTAL
REFLECTION X-RAY FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY (TXRF)
1  Purpose
1. 1    The   test   provides   the   analytica l   procedure   to
determine  the  trace  level  of  contaminating  elements  of
an   atomic   number   higher   than   15   on   polished   or
epitaxial  silicon  wafer  surfaces  in  native  or  thermally
grown  or  tetraethylorthosilicate  (TEOS)  oxide  or  in
residues   of   microdroplets   of   process   chemicals   or
media as analyzed with TXRF on silicon wafer surfaces
as described in Sections 15.1 and 15.2.
2  Scope
2. 1   This  document  specifies  a  VPD -TXRF  (Vapor
Phase     Decomposition     Total     Reflection     X-Ray
Fluorescence   Spectroscopy)   method   to   analyze   the
elemental  composition  and  areal  density  of  impurities,
that  include  cations  and  anions  with  atomic  numbers
between   16   (S)   and   92   (U)   independent   of   their
chemical  state,  with  the  exception  of  the  X-ray  source
material, on polished or epitaxial silicon wafer surfaces
in  native  or  thermally  grown  oxide  or  in  residues  of
microdroplets   of   process   chemicals   or   media   as
analyzed with TXRF on silicon wafer surfaces.
2. 2  This test is especially useful fo r analyzing metallic
elements such as K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu,
Zn, (Mo), Pd, Ag, Sn, Sb, Ta, (W), Pt, (Au), Hg, and Pb
and  non-metallic  elements  such  as  S,  Cl,  As,  Br,  and  I
through their characteristic K and L lines. (Elements in
brackets are usual X-ray sources.) For limitations in the
nature of analytes refer to the note in Section 14.7.
2. 3   This  test  method  can  be  used  t o  analyze  areal
surface   contamination   that   can   be   collected   in   a
microdroplet during the specified VPD preparation and
the  collection  of  the  digested  surface  contamination  in
the range of 5 × 10
8
through 5 × 10
12
atoms/cm
2
.
2. 4   Theoretically,  the  detection  lim it  (LOD)  of  each
analyte depends upon its atomic number. As defined by
DIN   32645   “Limit   of   detection,   determination   and
quantification”  the  LOD  of  TXRF  is  also  depending
upon many parameters, such as:
—  excitation energy,
—  intensity of incident X-ray,
—  instrumental background,
—  crystallographic   interferences,   such   as   Bragg
diffraction conditions,
—  impurities in the beam path,
—  contamination  of  the  blank  scanning  solution
(see Section 4.5),
—  contamination level in the analytical ambient,
—  surface    microroughness    of    wafer    at    the
microdroplet (see Section 6.7), and
—  integration time.
2. 5  Concerning the surface conditi ons to be analyzed,
the  VPD-TXRF  method  is  invasive.  Nevertheless,  the
TXRF  analysis  of  the  microdroplet  residue  can  be
repeated   many   times   provided   that   the   prepared
specimen   is   stored   in   a   clean   environment.   The
substrate  and/or  surrogate  wafers  can  be  recycled  for
monitoring purposes.
2. 6   The  user  of  this  test  method  m ust  assure  that  the
metrology equipment is under control by the procedures
commonly  utilized  in  the  performing  laboratory.  In  the
absence  of  established  control  procedures  the  use  of
4. 11.2 EN-ISO 9001 is recommended.
NOTICE  SAFETY  PRECAUTIONS  —  This  standard
does   not   purport   to   address   the   safety   concerns,
associated  with  its  use.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the
user   of   this   standard   to   establish   and   maintain
appropriate safety and health practices and comply with

15. 4,  or  15.5  (also  see  Sections  5.1  and  11  of  this
document).
5  Summary of Method
5. 1   The  native  or  thermally  grown   oxide  layer  of  the
silicon  surface  is  converted  with  HF  vapor  into  fluid
droplets  that  contain  the  impurities  of  the  oxide  layer.
With  a  scanning  droplet  the  fluid  reaction  products  are
collected  in  one  microdroplet.  That  microdroplet  is
dried  on  the  wafer  under  controlled  conditions  and
analyzed with TXRF.
5. 2   Similarly,  a  microdroplet  of  pr ocess  chemicals  or
media   can   be   dried   on   hydrophobic   polished   or
epitaxial  silicon  wafer  under  controlled  conditions  and
analyzed with TXRF.
5. 3   Preferably,  monochromatic  an d  collimated  X-rays
irradiate a planarized and chemi-mechanically polished,
monocrystalline   silicon   wafer   surface.   The   X-rays
impinge the surface at a glancing angle that is below the
angle for total reflection of the X-rays, preferably, at an
incident  angle  70%  of  the  angle  of  total  reflection  [1.3
mrad  (or  0.07  degrees)  for  Mo  target  and  2.0  mrad  (or
0. 11 degrees) for W target].
5. 4   The  evanescent  waves  excite  t he  fluorescence
energy  levels  of  the  surface  atoms,  which  then  emit
fluorescence   X-rays   characteristic   of   their   atomic
number.  The  emitted  X-rays  are  detected  by  a  solid
state detector that is an energy dispersive spectrometer.
In  the  range  of  specified  areal  density  (compare  with
Section  2.3  of  this  document)  the  integrated  count  rate
(cps)  is  linearly  proportional  to  the  elemental  areal
density.
5. 5   For  quantification,  the  linear  re gression  must  be
established     (c.f.,     Section     15.6)     or     a     linear
proportionality  is  anticipated  between  the  cps  data  that
are     measured     above     the     certified     reference
microdroplet(s)  and  the  cps  data  that  are  measured
above   the   microdroplet   of   the   unknown   analytes
without  changing  the  anglescan  conditions,  according
to Sections 9.1, 13.6, and 15.7.
6  Interferences
6. 1   The  known  interferences  in  X-r ay  fluorescence
spectroscopy   also   affect   TXRF.   Thus,   overlapping
fluorescence lines, escape peak, energy gain drift, X-ray
source  stability,  beam  path  background  contamination
must  be  evaluated  according  to  Section  15.7  of  this
document.
6. 2   Baseline  corrections  due  to  va rying  background
contamination   must   be   controlled   by   the   rules   of
statistical analysis (e.g., as described in Section 15.8 of
this document).
6. 3   Under  the  specified  conditions ,  no  corrections  are
required  for  secondary  fluorescence  or  for  oscillations
or for matrix absorption as described in Sections 15.9–
15. 11 of this document.
6. 4   Accuracy  of  the  standard  refer ence  specimen  and
positioning   accuracy   and   precision   of   the   detector
define the bias in the assigned areal density.
6. 5   Mechanical  vibration  may  deg rade  the  detector
resolution and it can also decrease the selectivity.
6. 6   Multielement  contamination  d egrades  the  LOD
compared with monoelement contamination.
6. 7   Increased  surface  microroughn ess  and/or  high-
total  signal  count  rates  result  in  high  deadtime  and  can
lead  to  non-linearity  of  detected  fluorescence  signal
versus areal density (i.e., to degradation of LOD).
6. 8    Under   optical   conditions   satisf ying   the   Bragg
reflections  the  background  noise  depends  upon  the
azimuthal     orientation     of     the     sample.     Before
quantification, a determination of the azimuthal angular
range,     that     shows     minimum     Bragg     reflection
background, is recommended. Otherwise the LOD may
degrade due to high background and spurious peaks.
6. 9   During  handling  and  measurem e nt  particles  or
volatile  contamination  (e.g.,  NH
3
)  from  the  analytical
environment must be controlled and avoided.
6. 10   During  measurement  Ar  must   be  excluded  from
the analytical ambient (e.g., by evacuating the chamber
or flushing it with He).
6. 11  Curve smoothing and evaluatio n algorithms with
controlled  Fourier  parameters  or  Digital  Filtering  are
preferred  to  direct  count  rate  evaluation  because  these
algorithms    provide    a    higher    level    of    statistical
confidence  than  a  software  that  directly  quantifies  cps
as described in Section 15.12 of this document.
6. 12  Recovery rates as defined in S ection 4.13 of this
document  depend  upon  the  distribution  of  the  analytes
between  the  scanning  solution  (solubility)  and  silicon
surface  (adsorption  and  plating).  Therefore,  recovery
rates depend on the:
—  applied scanning solution (Sections 4.5, 8.3),
—  chemical        nature        of        the        different
analytes/elements, and
—  physical and physicochemical state of the silicon
surface.
6. 13   Automated  contamination  coll ection  procedure
(scanning)  increases  the  wafer-to-wafer  reproducibility

of the described method as reported in Section 15.13 of
this document.
7  Apparatus
7. 1   The  VPD  treatment  and  contam ination  collection
particularly,  but  also  the  handling  and  measurement  of
the  specimen  wafer  is  to  be  carried  out  in  a  specified
and   controlled   ambient   (e.g.,   Cl.   10   (U.S.   Federal
Standard 209)).
7. 2  TXRF system equipped with:
—  an X-ray source,
—  a monochromator (preferable),
—  a sample stage capable of manipulating in the x-,
y-, and z-direction,
—  automated test specimen handling,
—  an      energy-dispersive      spectrometer      X-ray
detector,
—  software     sub-routine     for     glancing     angle
calibration,
—  software for baseline setting and for peak-fitting
and/or   range-of-interest   (ROI)   peak   finding
identification and evaluation, and
—  analysis  ambient  without  Ar  background  (see
Sections  6.10  and  7.1  of  ASTM  F  1526).  The
system  is  preferably  equipped  with  a  flat/notch-
finder  and  quick-search  option.  For  details,  see
Section 6.10 of this document and Section 7.1 of
ASTM F 1526.
7. 3  The VPD and the advisable dr ying chamber(s) will
have     opening(s)     made     of     polyvinylidenfluoride
(PVDF),  polyfluoroalkoxyethylene  (PFA),  polyfluoro-
ethylene  (PTFE)  or  similar  resistant  and  pure  polymer
materials   that   will   not   be   attacked   by   HF.   The
chamber(s)  may  contain  one  or  more  wafers  on  stacks.
The  use  of  a  drying  chamber  is  advisable  for  the
preparation  of  the  calibration  reference  microdroplet
(c.f.,   Section   10.1),   but   optional   for   the   analysis
procedure.  When  a  drying  chamber  is  used,  it  must  be
evacuable   to   below   1   kPa.   After   evacuation   the
chamber  is  to  be  flushed  with  filtered  N
2
until  the
complete drying of the microdroplet residue is achieved
(see Section 9.1 of this document).
7. 4   For  the  aliquots  of  standard  sto ck  and  scanning
solutions    validated    micropipettes    must    be    used.
Validation  procedure  can  follow  the  requirements  of
DIN 12650 Part 6.

during   drying.   They   should   not   exceed   an   areal
dimension of 1 mm in any direction. Elements forming

volatile compounds must not be applied (see the note in
Section 14.7).
10  Calibration Procedure
SAFETY   PRECAUTIONS   —   X-ray   irradiation   is
dangerous.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  user  of  this
standard  to  establish  and  maintain  appropriate  safety
and   health   practices   and   comply   with   the   local
regulatory   ordinance.   The   X-ray   source   must   be
inactivated  when  beam  path  is  unshielded.  Operators
must be trained to avoid exposure to X-ray irradiation.
10. 1  The calibration standard is a m icrodroplet of 100
μL  of  a  diluted  certified  standard  reference  “stock”
solution.  Note  that  the  shelf  life  of  diluted  solutions  in
the sub-ppb-range of μg/L or ng/mL is less than 2 days.
10. 2    Locate   the   calibration   standard    microdroplet
residue  and  place  it  under  the  detector.  Adjust  the
glancing  angle  into  the  range  where  the  fluorescence
count  rate  is  independent  of  varying  incidence  angle
(see Section 8.5 of this document).
10. 3   Position  the  detector  window  a s  follows.  Set
mapping  or  quick  search  parameters  for  covering  the
residue(s)  with  3  ×  3  detection  spots  (see  Figure  1),
which  are  placed  around  the  residue(s)  as  described  in
Section  15.6  of  this  document.    The  mapped  surface
must  cover  at  least  95%  of  the  square  around  the
residue(s)  that  is  lying  about  in  the  center  of  the
detection  spot.    The  analyzed  part  of  microdroplet
residue  under  the  detection  spot  must  be  higher  than
95%.
Figure 1
VPD-Search VPD/TXRF
10. 4  Set for mapping around the mi crodroplet residue
with   a   50-sec   integration   time   program   at   each
detection spot. Integrate at the maximum position(s) for
at least 1000 sec. These data provide the final result of
calibration due to the algorithm given in Section 13.6 of
this document.
10. 5  Repeat calibration cycle (load-a nalyze-unload) at
least 3-times.
10. 6    In   order   to   distinguish   relevan t   results   from
particle  contamination  from  the  environment  and  from
inefficient        contamination        collection,        repeat
measurement    on    blank    surface    adjacent    to    the
microdroplet solution. The data are to be considered as
background  data  in  the  quantification  algorithm  (see
Section  15.12  of  this  document).  For  valid  calibration,
background  fluorescence  counts  must  remain  less  than
20%   of   the   fluorescence   counts   of   microdroplet
residues, particularly, at lower areal densities (< 1 × 10
9
atoms/cm
2
).
10. 7    The   integrated   fluorescence   co unts   measured
with   the   specified   Ni   calibration   standard   can   be
converted   by   known   sensitivity   factors   into   other
elements  of  interest  as  described  in  the  References
section    (see    Sections    15.14    and    15.15    of    this
document).
10. 8     Keep    the    calibration    standards     in    closed,
identifiable  wafer  holders  in  a  clean  room  at  room
temperature  under  conditions  that  will  not  change  the
fluorescence reproducibility.
10. 9    Optional   linearity   tests   should    deploy   the
methods  described  in  References  section  (see  Section
15. 16  of  this  document).  Similar  statistical  linearity
tests can also be applied.
10. 10     Upon    the    users    request,    the    ab solute
instrumental  calibration  factor  can  be  obtained.  Due  to
the     Fresnel     theory     of     X-ray     absorption     and
enhancement  on  pure  metal  (Ni)  surfaces,  the  absolute
calibration  can  be  carried  out  under  specific  optical
conditions.  (See  Referenced  Documents  section  and
specifically    Section    15.17.).    Then,    that    absolute
calibration    can    be    correlated    to    the    external
microdroplet calibration.
11  Preparation Procedure
11. 1   VPD  treatment  of  the  wafer  su rface  (Section
4. 16)  and  the  collection  of  contamination  collection
with a scanning microdroplet (Section 4.5).
SAFETY    PRECAUTIONS    —    Handling    HF    is
dangerous.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  user  of  this
standard  to  establish  and  maintain  appropriate  safety
and   health   practices   and   comply   with   the   local
regulatory ordinance. Operators must be trained to wear
protective  garments  and  glasses  when  handling  HF
under efficient exhaust.
11. 2   In  the  VPD  chamber  wafers  ar e  treated  with  HF
vapor  (e.g.,  isothermally  distilled  at  room  temperature
from an aqueous solution (20–50 volume %) within the
VPD chamber). The analytical specimen, the calibration

SEMI M33-0998 © SEMI 19986
droplet  and  the  scanning  droplet  must  be  handled,
prepared   and   dried   under   specified   and   controlled
conditions.   Drying   means   the   evaporation   of   the
solvents  on  the  wafer  surface  in  a  clean  and  controlled
environment    without    loosing    analytes    from    the
microdroplet residue.
11. 3   The  wafers  are  exposed  to  the   HF  vapor  in  the
VPD chamber at room temperature. The exposure time
depends on the concentration of the HF used and on the
preceeding  wafer  treatment.  The  time  has  to  be  long
enough  to  ensure  that  the  wafer  surface  will  become
hydrophobic.  After  the  HF  treatment  the  solubilized
reaction    products    are    collected    by    scanning    a
microdroplet    over    the    whole    surface.    Automatic
scanning   is   preferable   (see   Section   6.13   of   this
document). The composition of the scanning solution is
optional but its volume and drying conditions should be
the   same   as   under   the   preparation   of   calibration
standards (see Sections 8 and 15.18 of this document).
11. 4   An  example  for  tested  prepara tion  conditions
according  to  Section  15.18  of  this  document.  A  PTFE
or  PFA  petri  dish  of  a  diameter  >  25  cm  is  filled  with
20 volume % HF by mixing DI ultra pure water and 40
volume  %  HF  of  ULSI  grade  in  a  clean  room  ambient
of Cl 10 by U.S. Federal Standard 209. The petri dish is
positioned  in  the  bottom  of  the  VPD  chamber,  loaded
with  specimen  wafers.  The  wafers  are  exposed  to  the
HF   wafer   at   room   temperature.   Exposure   time   is
between  30  minutes  and  6  hours.  Longer  exposure
times  can  lead  to  deliberate  etching.  After  the  HF
treatment    the    solubilized,    reaction    products    are
collected  by  rolling  a  scanning  microdroplet  over  the
whole surface. Automatic scanning is preferable. Please
refer also to Section 4.5 and Section 8.3 of SEMI E45.
11. 5   Rinse  the  validated  micropipet te  at  least  5  times
with  ultra  pure  water  or  with  the  selected  scanning
solution.  Then  fill  the  micropipette  with  the  required
amount   of   ultra   pure   water   or   with   the   scanning
solution.  For  scanning  surfaces  with  thicker  silicon
oxide   (>   300   nm)   only   about   50   μL   of   scanning
solution  is  sufficient.  The  microdroplet  to  be  dried  for
analysis should not extensively (+10%) exceed 100 μL
together with the VPD reaction products.
11. 6    Put   the   scanning   microdroplet    on   the   wafer
surface  and  roll  the  scanning  microdroplet  around  the
wafer edge 2 times and then over the whole surface in a
zigzag  pattern.  Automatic  equipment  can  scan  in  a
spiral pattern with overlapping paths (see Section 6.13).
An  edge  exclusion  of  less  than  1  mm  is  attainable  for
manual  or  automatic  scanning.  Edge  exclusion  is  well
below 1 mm at automatic scanning.
11. 7   Position  the  scanning  microdro plet  in  the  center
of the wafer.
11. 8    For   monitoring   the   cleanliness    of   the   VPD
preparation and contamination collection and that of the
analytical  ambient,  put  the  same  volume  of  the  blank
scanning  solution,  as  applied  to  the  preparation  of  the
calibration  standard  (100  μL  under  tested  preparation
conditions),  with  the  validated  micropipette  onto  the
scanned specimen surface at least 3 cm off the position
of  the  scanning  solution.  For  valid  results  fluorescence
counts  above  the  blank  must  remain  less  than  20%  of
the fluorescence counts above the droplet residues. Use
ultra   pure   water   (100   μL)   for   blanks   of   process
chemical  and  media  samples.  If  the  scanning  solution
consists  only  of  ultra  pure  water  of  controlled  quality,
no blanks are required.
NOTE:  In  the  absence  of  oxidation  agent(s),  Cu  recovery
rates can be reduced (see Section 15.18).
11. 9   Dry  the  wafers  as  specified  in   Sections  7.3,  9.1,
and 11.2 of this document.
12  Analysis Procedure
12. 1    Localize   the   microdroplet   resid ues   of   the
collected scanning solution or the microdroplet residues
of  the  liquid  process  medium  and  the  microdroplet
residue    of    the    blank    scanning    solution.    Detect
fluorescence  counting  rates  above  these  microdroplet
residues and above the scanned blank surface under the
instrumental  parameter  adjusted  for  calibration.  The
quantification   algorithm   is   given   in   Section   13.6.
Integrated  counts  above  both  the  blanks  and  the  VPD
prepared surface must not exceed 20% of the integrated
counts  above  the  microdroplet  residue  of  the  collected
scanning solution (see Section 9.6 of this document).
13  Quantification Procedure
13. 1    The   instrument   must   run   unde r   established
statistical  process  control  (e.g.,  as  described  in  Section
15. 19 of this document).
13. 2    Before   releasing   results,   quote    instrumental
parameters such as:
• rotating or sealed anode,
• voltage and current applied to the X-ray source,
• characteristic  excitation  line(s)  of  the  incident  X-
ray,
• glancing angle(s),
• type of monochromator,
• amount [ng] or [number of atoms] of e.g., Ni in the
calibration standard reference microdroplet,
• location of the microdroplet(s) analyzed,
• peak evaluation technique (ROI or peak-fitting),

SEMI M33-0998 © SEMI 19987
• measurement time,
• analysis results on the blank microdroplet,
• compositions and amount of the scanning droplet,
• running  time  since  last  calibration  or  frequency  of
SPC measurement,
• lab   environment   classification   by   U.S.   Federal
Standard 209,
• edge exclusion, if any (c.f., Sections 4.2 and 11.6).

13. 4   Detection  spot  area  is  the  surfa ce  area  where

14  Bias and Precision
14. 1    Relative   error   of   the   described    VPD-TXRF
method must be assessed according to Section 15.11 of
this    document.    Under    the    given    measurement
conditions  the  accuracy  of  the  results  is  limited  by  the
error summarized in Section 14.2.
14. 2
Under  given  solute  amounts  an d  measurement

14. 4   The  relative  error  of  areal  conc entrations  below
the  concentration  of  the  calibration  standard  reference
are  strongly  dependent  upon  the  relative  error  of  the
micropipette  aliquots.  In  the  given  range  bias  due  to
crystallization     and/or     mass     absorption     can     be
anticipated  to  be  less  than  1%  as  described  in  Sections
15. 6 and 15.11 of this document.
14. 5
Reproducibility of the measure ment system must
be  tested  with  calibration  standard  reference  in  five
complete  analysis  cycles  (load-analyze-unload).  The
standard  deviation  of  the  5  results  shall  not  exceed
more  than  10%  of  the  theoretical  value  of  the  standard
deviation  of  the  respective  Poisson  statistics
Nx.  For
long term reproducibility, please refer to Section 2.6.
14. 6
The  minimum  sample  size  for   controlling  the
wafer-to-wafer     reproducibility     of     the     complete
procedure  must  consist  of  a  group  of  3  wafers  of  the
very same polishing and/or cleaning batch as described
in  Section  15.20  of  this  document.  Tolerated  standard
deviation   of   3   groups   should   be   defined   by   the
interested parties.
14. 7
In   interlaboratory   tests   (round    robin),   the
reproducibility   of   the   method   can   preferably   be
evaluated in accordance with DIN ISO 5725 or ASTM
E 691.
NOTE:   Report   reproducibility   in   accordance   with   this
document.  Calibration  accuracy  was  found  to  be  within  10%
relative  standard  deviation  for  K,  Ca,  Ti,  Cr,  Fe,  and  Cu
among  five  TXRF  stations  as  stated  in  Section  15.21  of  this
document. W and other compounds forming volatile fluorides
shall  not  be  analyzed  after  VPD  because  of  low  recovery
rates.

GUIDE FOR SPECIFYING SIMOX WAFERS

# 1

1.   Purpose
1. 1    This    guide    is    for    specification    of    SIMOX
(separation by implantation of oxygen) wafers with less
than    0.5    μm    silicon    film    thickness    used    for
semiconductor    device    manufacture.    These    speci-
fications  define  the  generic  characteristics  of  SIMOX
SOI    wafers;    the    specific    values    for    measured
parameters  will  be  determined  by  agreement  between
the  user  and  supplier  for  the  application.  By  defining
parameters,   inspection   procedures,   and   acceptance
criteria,  both  users  and  suppliers  may  uniformly  define
product characteristics and quality requirements.

7.   Test Methods - Dimensions
7. 1 SIMOX Layer Thickness Measurements
7. 1.1 Measurements   Methods      Two   non-contact,
non-destructive    optical    characterization    techniques,
spectroscopic      reflectometry      and      spectroscopic
ellipsometry,  have  proven  useful  for  SIMOX  layer
thickness  measurements.  Both  techniques  use  reflected
light  to  allow  deduction  of  the  thickness  and  refractive
index  of  thin  film  layers.  In  both  cases,  film  thickness
and index of refraction data must be "backed out" of the
measured   optical   data   by   a   process   of   successive
approximation.  In  both  cases,  the  fitting  procedure  is
more straightforward and more accurate the as-annealed
SIMOX wafers with abrupt silicon/oxide interfaces than
for   the   implanted   SIMOX   wafers   with   extended
interface     zones.     Silicon     islands     and     interface
nonuniformities  make  these  techniques  problematic  for
SIMOX  wafers  with  oxygen  implant  doses  below  the
"stoichiometric  dose",  roughly  1.6  ×  10
18
O
+
/cm

for  a
375 nm oxide layer.
7. 1.1.1   The measurement strategy is to make a detailed
measurement with an accurate fit on at least five wafer
sites, including the center as illustrated in Figure 1. The
number of wafer sites to be monitored should be agreed
on between customer and vendor. Generally, the greater
the  variability  relative  to  the  mean,  the  larger  the
number of sites that should be monitored. In each case,
the  measurement  system  supplies  a  "goodness-of-fit"
parameter  which  indicates  a  level  of  confidence  in  the
fit to the measured data.

SEMI M34-0299 © SEMI 1999 3
7. 1.2 Spectroscopic  Ellipsometry  Measurement  —  In
this  measurement,  white  light  from  a  xenon  arc  lamp
passes    through    a    polarizing    rotating    filter    and
illuminates  the  sample  site  under  study;  reflected  light
passes  through  an  analyzer  to  a  monochromator  and
photomultiplier     detector.     For     each     wavelength,
reflectivity    oscillates    with    polarizer    rotation;    the
magnitude   and   phase   of   reflectivity   changes   are
measured  to  determine  ellipsometric  angles,  δ  and  ψ.
The   two   measured   spectra   are   fit   by   successive
approximation to allow determination of the silicon and
oxide     layer     thickness     and     oxide     composition.
Ellipsometry  measurements  are  only  specified  for  the
annealed      SIMOX      wafers.      For      spectroscopic
ellipsometry,  the  choice  of  instrument  and  associated
model  and  fitting  parameters  affect  the  confidence-of-
fit,   so   they   should   be   taken   into   account   in   the
user/supplier agreement. For example, with the SOPRA
SE  system,  the  goodness-of-fit  error  estimator  shall  be
less than 0.025 for accurate structural models.
7. 1.3 Optical  Reflectance  Measurements  —  In  this
measurement,   light   from   a   xenon   arc   lamp   passes
through  a  grating  monochromator  and  illuminates  the
sample  site  under  study;  reflected  light  is  gathered  by
an  intrinsic  silicon  detector.  Specular  reflectivity  is
plotted as a function of wavelength from 0.4 micron to
1. 1    micron.    The    analysis    proceeds    by    making
successively   better   approximations   to   the   oxygen
content,  index  of  refraction,  and  absorption  of  each
layer  until  an  acceptable  fit  is  achieved.  Measurements
are     made     with     a     reflectance     mode     optical
interferometer.
7. 1.4 Optical  Model  Fitting  and  Correlation — There
are    slight,    systematic    differences    between    layer
thickness measured by reflectance and by spectroscopic
ellipsometry  (SE).  Because  of  this,  user  and  supplier
should  specify  the  actual  measurement  method  to  be
used.   The   two   methods   offer   results   which   are
reproducible and well-correlated with each other over a
wide    range    of    conditions.    If    both    measurement
techniques   are   used,   it   is   recommended   that   the
reflectance system measurements be calibrated to fit the
results of the SE. Figure 2 shows conversion curves for
top  silicon  and  oxide  layer  thickness  measurements
made with the two measurement techniques.
7. 1.5 Top  Silicon  Layer  Thickness  —  See  Section
7. 1.4  on  correlation  of  reflectance  and  spectroscopic
ellipsometry   (SE)   measurements.   Optical   measure-
ments  will  be  made  on  five  wafer  sites  as  shown  in
Figure 1. Spectra for each site will be fit independently
with  both  the  top  silicon  and  oxide  layer  thickness  as
adjustable parameters. Both the mean thickness and the
uniformity  should  be  specified.  Depending  on  the  type
of SIMOX wafer being specified, the mean thickness of
the  top  silicon  layer  will  be  from  50  nm  to  500  nm.
Following is an example specification: Mean top silicon
layer  thickness  for  the  five  sites  will  be  215  ±  10  nm
with  acceptable  goodness-of-fit  at  all  five  sites.  Top
silicon non-uniformity will be less than ± 5 nm.
7. 1.6 Buried  Oxide  Layer  Thickness  —  See  Section
7. 1.4  on  correlation  of  reflectance  and  spectroscopic
ellipsometry   (SE)   measurements.   Optical   measure-
ments  will  be  made  on  five  wafer  sites  as  shown  in
Figure 1. Spectra for each site will be fit independently
with  both  the  top  silicon  and  the  buried  oxide  layer
thickness   as   adjustable   parameters.   Both   the   mean
thickness   and   the   uniformity   should   be   specified.
Depending   on   the   type   of   SIMOX   wafer   being
specified,  the  mean  thickness  of  the  buried  oxide  layer
is  from  50  nm  to  500  nm.  Following  is  an  example
specification: Mean buried oxide layer thickness for the
five  sites  will  be  380  nm  ±  20  nm  with  acceptable
goodness-of-fit at all five sites. Buried oxide uniformity
will be less than ± 10 nm.
7. 2 Crystallographic   Defect   Measurements   -   Test
Methods  —  The  evaluation  of  threading  dislocation
density  in  the  top  SI  layer  will  be  made  by  destructive
chemical   etching   and   microscopic   etch   pit   density
measurements.  The  appropriate  evaluation  procedure
for   given   SIMOX   wafer,   which   depends   on   the
threading dislocation density and the thickness of top Si
and  buried  oxide  layers,  will  be  determined  by  the
agreement between user and supplier.
7. 2.1   Optionally,  other  crystallographic  defects  which
may  be  formed  in  the  top  Si  layer  of  SIMOX  wafers,
such  as  oxide  precipitates  or  micro  stacking  faults,
silicon crystal defects induced by surface particles prior
to epi growth when epi is used to increase the thickness
of   the   top   silicon.   A   sampling   plan   should   be
established based on experience with the supplier.
7. 2.2   Following  are  examples  of  the  evaluation  of
threading dislocations in two kinds of SIMOX wafers:
7. 2.2.1   Example 1. Threading dislocation evaluation in
SIMOX wafers with 200 nm thick top Si layer and 400
nm thick buried oxide: Samples are handled with plastic
tweezers throughout the etching procedure. Samples are
first stripped of native oxide by dipping in Bell 2 or HF
stripping  solutions.  Immediately  after  stripping,  wafers
are dipped in freshly prepared standard Secco Etch: one
part (by volume) of a 0.15 molar solution of K
2
Cr

O
7
in
distilled  water  and  two  parts  HF  (49%).  Samples  are
dipped in the Secco etch until 50 nm of silicon remains,
and  then  they  are  rinsed  thoroughly  in  distilled  water
and  blown  dry.  The  thickness  of  the  remaining  silicon
ensures  that  stacking  fault  pyramids  found  in  multiple
implant material are counted. The threading dislocation
density  may  vary  over  a  wide  range,  depending  on  the



SEMI M34-0299 © SEMI 1999 4
type  of  material.  The  Secco  Etch,  as  described,  creates
etch  pits  that  appear  as  dark  circles  roughly  50  nm  in
diameter,  and  pictures  should  be  taken  at  2500X  to
20,000X   magnification   in   order   to   unambiguaously
identify and count the etch pits. This is suitable for high
density  defect  samples.  For  lower  dislocation  densities
typical  of  recent  SIMOX  material,  a  third  etch  in
buffered  HF  (1  HF  (49%):  6  NH
4
F  (40%))  for  10
minutes  will  etch  the  buried  oxide  under  each  Secco
etch  pit,  creating  a  char-acteristic  circular  shape  2  μm
in diameter that can be seen at 500X magnification.

7. 2.2.2   Example  2.  Threading  dislocation  eval-uation
in  SIMOX  wafers  with  170  nm  thick  top  Si  layer  and
100 nm thick buried oxide: Samples are first immersed
in  HF  to  remove  oxide  from  the  surface.  Then  the
samples  are  etched  for  30  seconds  in  the  solution:

O   4g].   The
thickness  of  removed  silicon  is  about  1/3  of  the  initial
top Si layer thickness, i.e., about 60 nm. After rinsing in
water,  samples  are  dipped  in  HF  (49%)  for  5  minutes.
The  HF  etches  the  buried  oxide  and  creates  cavities
under  the  etch  pits.  The  cavities  are  around  10  μm  in
diameter.  Each  cavity  corresponds  to  one  dislocation
threading  the  top  Si  layer.  The  cavities  can  be  seen  at
50X magnification.
7. 2.2.3    A  recommended  protocol  for  the  micro-scopic
etch pit density measurement is to take enough pictures
to  count  at  least  50  etch  pits,  and  then  divide  the
number  counted  by  the  area  scanned  to  get  the  defect
density.  The  pictures  taken  should  be  non-overlapping
areas of the sample far from the tweezer marks and far
from the edges of the sample. Following is an example
specification: Of the five samples prepared from the test
wafers,    none    should    have    threading    dislocation
densities higher than 1 × 10
7
cm
-2
.
7. 3 Buried Oxide
7. 3.1 Buried  Oxide  Pinhole  Measurements  —  Buried
oxide  pinhole  evaluations  shall  be  made  by  CuS0
4

plating or copper decoration methods.
7. 3.1.1   In   the   evaluation   done   by   CuSO
4
plating
method  the  wafer  under  study  is  placed  (front  face
down) on a paper towel soaked in 20% CuSO
4
solution
on  top  of  a  copper  plate.  An  aluminum  plate  is  placed
on the back of the wafer. The copper plate is grounded,
and  -25  VDC  is  applied  to  the  aluminum  plate.  Small
(sub-micro    Angstrom)    leakage    currents    through
pinholes in the insulator cause copper to plate out onto
the towel at the pinhole density.
7. 3.1.2   In  the  evaluation  done  by  copper  decoration
method  the  top  Si  layer  is  first  etched  off  by  KOH
solution  to  expose  the  buried  oxide  layer.  Then  the
wafer  is  immersed  in  methanol  and  brought  downward
into  direct  contact  with  the  gold-coated  cathode.  A
copper  mesh  as  an  anode  is  immersed  in  the  liquid  5
mm above the wafer. Required voltage is applied, such
as   the   electric   field   in   the   buried   oxide   layer   is
1MV/cm. The voltage is measured at the oxide surface
with    a    surface    voltage    probe.   Localized   copper
decorations  at  pinhole  sites  in  the  oxide  are  observed
with a low power optical microscope.

Chemistry and Physics, 1993, vol. 35, p. 129
7. 3.1.3   Allowable   pinhole   density   depends   on   the
application  for  SIMOX  wafer  and  will  be  determined
by  the  agreement  between  user  and  vendor.  Typical
allowable pinhole density is 0.1/cm
2
.
7. 4 SIMOX Wafer Surface Inspection
7. 4.1 Total   Reflectance   X-Ray   Fluorescence   Mea-
surements   —   The   preferred   test   methodology   is
described in ASTM F 1526.
7. 4.1.1   The  instrument  provides  a  map  of  impurity
element   distribution.   As   an   example   specification,
surface contamination for elements within the detection
limits (typically S to Zn) shall be less than 10
10
cm
-2
per
element or < 10
11
cm
-2
total.
7. 4.1.2   The customer and vendor should be aware that
most  TXRF  systems  will  contaminate  a  wafer  -slightly
on  front  and  significantly  on  the  back.  (Reference:
DXRC, Denver CO, July 1996, abstract 5.1 "Particulate
Contamination  from  TXRF  Instru-mentation",  Dennis
Werho, et al.)
7. 4.2 Automated  Particle  Counter  Measurements  —
Automatic  production  tools  are  available  for  accurate
particle counting on fully processed SIMOX wafers for
particles   greater   than   0.25   micron.   Alternatively,
particles  down  to  0.1  micron  can  be  detected  on  as-
implanted    SIMOX    wafers    prior    to    anneal.    Any
specification  of  particle  count  should  include  the  point
in the process at which the measurement is to be made.
Following is an example specification:
7. 4.2.1   Instrument  settings  shall  allow  detection  of
particles  from  0.3−10  micron  size.  Maximum  allow-
able  particle  count,  with  a  6  mm  edge  exclusion,  is  20
particles  greater  than  0.25  micron  size  per  150  mm
wafer, or 0.1 particles/cm
2
, just prior to shipping.
7. 4.3 Visual  and  Microscopic  Inspection  —  Visual
inspection techniques will be in accordance with ASTM
F    523,    when    possible,    by    automatic    inspection
equipment.   Alternatively,   slices   will   be   inspected
visually  under  fluorescent  light  for  chips,  fractures,
scratches,  fragmentation,  saw  marks,  grinder  marks,
and   dimples   and   also   under   a   narrow   beam   high
intensity  light  (>  6000  footcandles),  for  fractures,  film
haze,   contamination,   and   scratches.   SIMOX   wafers
typically   exhibit   uniform   light   haze   due   to   light
scattering  from  the  rough  silicon/oxide  interface  and
from  silicon  precipitates  in  the  BOX.  A  light,  uniform
haze is typically acceptable, while patches of moderate
or heavy haze typically are not acceptable.
7. 4.3.1   Standards   for   specification  of  haze  are  being
developed  for  bulk  silicon.  A  modification  of  that
specification  will  be  required  for  SIMOX  material.  It
may  be  necessary  to  iterate  between  customer  and
vendor to agree on specification of acceptable haze.



SEMI M34-0299 © SEMI 1999 6
7. 4.4 Surface  Roughness  —  Surface  roughness  is  a
measure  of  the  microscopic  topology  of  the  wafer
surface.  The  effect  of  this  parameter  may  be  in  Gate
Oxide  Integrity  (GOI)  on  MOS  devices,  depending  on
the  design  and  process.  The  measurement  of  surface
roughness  is  done  on  an  atomic  scale  by  an  Atomic
Force  Microscope  (AFM).  With  AFM,  it  is  suggested
that  four  measurement  areas  of  greater  than  2  μm
2
be
measured  at  each  of  five  measurement  locations,  with
the  measurement  locations  distributed  as  in  Figure  1.
Because   of   the   expense   of   this   measurement,   a
sampling plan should be established with the supplier.
7. 4.4.1   Standards  for  specification  of  surface  rough-
ness  are  being  developed  for  bulk  silicon  and  shall  be
applicable here when adopted.
7. 4.5 HF  Defect  Measurements  -  Test  Methods

Measurement   of   the   microscopic   etch   pit   density
following  an  HF  etch  is  a  method  commonly  used  to
disclose  defects  in  SOI  material.  Pitting  of  the  top
silicon surface may be present before the HF etch or be
caused     by     HF     etching.     For     this     destructive
measurement, at least one quarter of a wafer should be
used  and  preferably  a  whole  wafer.  The  sample  is
placed in concentrated (49%) HF for 10 to 15 minutes,
then  removed,  rinsed  and  dried.  If  there  are  pits  in  the
SI  surface,  metal  particles  embedded  in  the  surface  or
silicides formed in the top Si layer, the HF will etch the
metals/silicides  and  then  etch  the  buried  oxide.  This
results in a section of the buried oxide being etched out
that is 25−50 μm diameter (depending on the etch time)
centered  on  the  original  pit  or  particle.  The  defect
density is then measured in an optical microscope using
a  5X  objective  and  10X  eyepiece  or  comparable  setup.
The  sample  should  be  scanned  2−3  times  near  the
center  of  the  wafer  if  a  whole  wafer  is  used  to  get
sufficient  statistics.  If  a  piece  of  a  wafer  is  used,  the
scan  should  be  adjusted  accordingly.  The  total  area
scanned should be at least 10 cm
2
. Care should be taken
to  exclude  edge  density  depending  on  the  expected
impact   on   yield   versus   material   cost.   A   typical
specification is that the HF defect density should be less
than 1/cm
2
.

8.   Electrical   Parameters
8. 1 Photoconductivity Lifetime — This is measured by
creating an excess of carriers (typically by using a light
source)  and  measuring  the  slope  of  the  decay  curve.
Several  pieces  of  commercial  equipment  are  available
for  this  purpose.  This  requires  that  polysilicon  is  not
deposited  on  the  backside,  as  is  sometimes  done  for
gettering.  Also,  surface  passivation  may  be  needed  for
lifetime     measurements.     Backside     measurements
indicate   the   quality   of   the   substrate   and   can   be
performed      by      traditional      methods.      Frontside
measurements are more difficult and must be performed
using  incident  light  which  can  be  entirely  absorbed
before reaching the underlying substrate.
8. 1.1   Typically, the sample is placed on a micro-wave
wave  guide  post,  forming  part  of  a  transmission  line
circuit.  The  microwave  reflection  is  determined  by  the
total conductivity of the sample and the conductivity is
modulated  by  an  intense  light  pulse.  When  the  light  is
turned off, the microwave detects an exponential decay
in   conductivity   from   which   a   decay   constant   is
determined.  The  photoconductivity  lifetime  is  a  result
of  the  recombination  velocity  at  the  surfaces,  volume
recombination  in  the  silicon  layer,  and  any  trapping.
Measurements are made independently on the front and



SEMI M34-0299 © SEMI 1999 9
back   sides   of   the   wafer.   The   mean   value   on   the
backside  of  the  wafer  will  typically  be  at  least  10
microseconds  for  N-type  material  and  3  microseconds
for P-type material. These values correspond to about a
100 micron diffusion length (SPV value).
8. 1.2   The  relevance  of  photoconductivity  lifetime  to
the  users  requirement  should  be  discussed.  The  use  of
this    measurement    should    be    negotiated    between
customer and vendor.
8. 2 BOX   Breakdown    This   parameter   can   be
measured  with  a  buried  oxide  capacitor  (BOX-CAP).
The buried oxide thickness and the intended application
will  affect  both  the  test  procedure  (such  as  capacitor
area  and  voltage  criterion)  and  the  allowable  values  of
measured  parameters.  These  should  be  determined  by
agreement   between   the   user   and   vendor.   Example
procedure and values for standard evaluation of 400 nm
thick    buried    oxide    are    given    in    the    following
paragraphs.
8. 2.1 Test  Structure  —  Buried  oxide  capacitor  (BOX-
CAP) having an area of 0.01 cm
2
for standard (400 nm)
BOX.  The  electrode  material  and  thickness  affect  the
breakdown  phenomena  due  to  thermal  effects,  and  so
should be included in the agreement between customer
and vendor.
8. 2.2 Test   Method:   Staircase   I-V   Measurement   —
Voltage  is  stepped  in  one-volt  increments  from  zero  to
400  volts,  or  until  destructive  breakdown  is  sensed.
Tests  are  done  for  both  bias  polarities.  The  test  detects
the  onset  of  high  field  conduction,  as  well  as  the  point
of destructive or massive charge injection and trapping.

8. 3 BOX  Pinhole  Density   This  parameter  can  be
measured  with  a  buried  oxide  capacitor  (BOX-CAP).
The buried oxide thickness and the intended application
will  affect  both  the  test  procedure  (such  as  capacitor
area  and  voltage  criterion)  and  the  allowable  values  of
measured  parameters.  These  should  be  determined  by
agreement   between   the   user   and   vendor.   Example
procedure and values for standard evaluation of 400 nm
thick    buried    oxide    are    given    in    the    following
paragraphs.
8. 3.1 Test  Structure  —  Buried  oxide  capacitor  having
an area equal to or greater than 0.05 cm
2
.
8. 3.2 Test   Method:   Staircase   I-V   —   Measurement
testing can be done for both Type I and Type II defects
where  Type  I  defects  are  silicon  pipes  traversing  the
buried  oxide,  and  Type  II  defects  are  local  regions  of
thin  buried  oxide.  If  Type  II  defect  density  is  sought,
capacitors  are  subjected  to  a  series  of  30  voltage  steps
of  3.3  volts,  with  current  monitored  after  each  step,
using a failure criterion of 1 nA.
8. 3.2.1   Arrays of at least 200 capacitors per wafer are
tested. Bias polarity of the voltage ramp is chosen so as
to  accumulate  the  substrate  portion  of  the  capacitor
(positive for n-silicon, negative for p-silicon).
8. 3.2.2   Type  I  defect  density  is  determined  using  the
same  test  procedure,  except  that  the  failure  current
criterion is 1 μΑ.
8. 3.2.3    Any  capacitor  displaying  the  failure  current  or
more  for  voltages  less  than  100  volts  is  considered
defective.  Defect  density  of  either  type  is  calculated
from  the  yield  of  good  capacitors,  (Y  =  1  −  #  failed/#
tested), using Poisson statistics;
D = -1n (Y)/A,
where A is the total area of the capacitors tested.
8. 3.2.4   For thin buried oxide (films less than 360 nm),
the voltage criteria above need to be adjusted to account
for  the  onset  of  high  field  conduction  in  defect-free
capacitors.
8. 3.3 Values
D (Type I) < = 0.2 defects/cm

8. 3.3.1   No  standardized  criterion  for  Type  II  defects
has been established.
8. 4 Buried  Oxide  Charge   This  parameter  can  be
measured  with  a  buried  oxide  capacitor  (BOX-CAP).
The buried oxide thickness and the intended application
will  affect  both  the  test  procedure  (such  as  capacitor
area  and  voltage  criterion)  and  the  allowable  values  of
measured  parameters.  These  should  be  determined  by
agreement   between   the   user   and   vendor.   Example
procedure and values for standard evaluation of 400 nm
thick    buried    oxide    are    given    in    the    following
paragraphs.
8. 4.1 Test  Structure  —  Buried  oxide  capacitor  having
an area of 0.01 cm
2
.
8. 4.2 Test   Method   —   MOS   high   frequency   C-V
measurement   of   a   buried   oxide   capacitor   normally
yields   a   flat   band   voltage   less   than   one   volt   in
magnitude. For a previously untested 400 nm film, this
implies  an  effective  fixed  charge  density  of  less  than  5

8. 5 Buried Oxide Fast Interfaces State Density  This
parameter   can   be   measured   with   a   buried   oxide
capacitor  (BOX-CAP).  The  buried  oxide  thickness  and
the   intended   application   will   affect   both   the   test
procedure (such as capacitor area and voltage criterion)
and   the   allowable   values   of   measured   parameters.
These should be determined by agreement between the
user  and  vendor.  Example  procedure  and  values  for
standard  evaluation  of  400  nm  thick  buried  oxide  are
given in the following paragraphs.
8. 5.1 Test  Structure  —  Buried  oxide  capacitor  having
an area of 0.01 cm
2
.
8. 5.2 Test Method — High-Low Frequency MOS C-V.
If  care  is  taken  in  their  fabrication  to  minimize  oxide
surface   damage   and   contamination   during   silicon
etching, good quality quasi-static MOS C-V curves can
be measured on BOX-CAP's. From comparison of high
and  low  frequency  C-V  curves,  midgap  interface  state
density  can  be  determined  exactly  as  for  normal  MOS
capacitors.

8. 6 Doping Density in the SIMOX Layer
8. 6.1 Test Structure — The untreated SIMOX wafer.
Substrate: Buried oxide capacitor, area = 0.01 cm

8. 6.2 Test  Method  —  Spreading  Resistance  Probing
(SRP) offers a way of determining the resistance profile
in  the  Si  layer  as  a  function  of  distance  from  the  top
surface.  The  carrier  concentration  can  be  calculated
directly from this data.
8. 6.2.1   The four point probe method of SIMS can also
be  used.  The  four  point  probe  test  is  liable  to  punch
through and should be considered a destructive test as is
SIMS.   SIMS   will   allow   for   an   understanding   of
compensation effects, if any.
8. 6.3 Values  The acceptable dopant values are to be
determined by agreement between the user and vendor.
8. 7 Doping Density in the Substrate

8. 7.2 Test  Method   The  electrically  active  dopant
concentration  in  the  substrate  immediately  beneath  the
buried  oxide  can  be  determined  from  the  standard
analysis  of  high  frequency  MOS  C-V  curves  measured
on   BOX-CAPs,   dependent   on   oxide   charge   and
interface properties.
Values  —  The  acceptable  dopant  values  are  to  be
determined by agreement between the user and vendor.

GUIDE FOR DEVELOPING SPECIFICATIONS FOR SILICON WAFER
SURFACE FEATURES DETECTED BY AUTOMATED INSPECTION
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved by the North American Regional
Standards  Committee  on  August  16,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  September  2004;  to  be
published November 2004.  Originally published February 1999.
1  Purpose
1. 1  Inspection  of  silicon  wafer  surfaces  is  a  standard
outgoing test on all commercially sold silicon wafers.
1. 2  Older specifications referred to visual inspection of
wafer  surfaces,  but  with  advanced  technologies,  the
sizes  of  many  important  surface  features  are  too  small
to   be   seen   visually   and   so   other   types   of   surface
inspection become necessary.
1. 3  This  guide  provides  a  specification  framework  for
reporting    measurements    of    silicon    wafer    surface
features  through  the  use  of  scanning  (or  automated)
surface inspection systems (SSIS).
2  Scope
2. 1  This   guide   addresses   specifications   related   to
localized  light  scatterers  (LLSs)  as  well  as  extended
light scatterers (XLSs).  Examples of LLSs are particles
and  pits.    Examples  of  XLSs  are  scratches  and  regions
of high roughness (surface haze).
2. 2  Surface    scanners,    which    have    discriminated
between  XLSs  and  LLSs  for  several  years,  are  now
discriminating   (and   selectively   reporting)   between
different   types   of   LLSs   (for   example:   pits   and
particles).
2. 3  Specific   numbers   limiting   feature   levels   and/or
densities  are  to  be  agreed  upon  between  suppliers  and
customers.    This  guide  provides  a  framework  for  that
communication.
2. 4  The resulting specifications will be flexible enough
to   accommodate   variations   in   measurement   due   to
different SSIS models.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the  applicability  of  regulatory  or  other  limitations  prior
to use.
3  Discussion
3. 1  Discussion of LLS Measurement Issues
3. 1.1  Because  there  is  considerable  variation  in  the
scatter characteristics of different LLSs, they have been
historically sized in latex sphere equivalents (LSE).  In
other words, the signal received from an unknown LLS
is  equivalent  to  that  which  would  be  obtained  from  a
polystyrene latex (PSL) sphere of known size.
3. 1.2  Automated  scanning  systems  typically  display  a
map  of  LLS  location  as  well  as  a  histogram  of  LSE
size.
3. 1.3  The  instrumentation  industry  is  building  SSISs
that  discriminate  some  LLSs  from  others  based  on
differences  in  measured  scatter  that  depend  on  feature
size,  shape  and  material.    This  raises  the  question  of
whether  identified  LLSs  should  continue  to  be  sized
using  latex  sphere  equivalents,  or  if  some  new  (more
accurate)  standard  would  be  more  acceptable.    For
example, if an LLS signal could be identified as coming
from a pit, then it might become appropriate to develop
a   standard   pit   wafer.      In   this   case,   pits   (either
manufactured  or  found  naturally)  could  be  measured
via   atomic   force   microscope   (AFM)   and   be   made
available  on  a  calibration  wafer  to  size  pits  via  their
measured  scatter.    Another  option,  would  be  to  use  a
model-based standard that resides in the SSIS software.
3. 2  Discussion of XLS Measurement Issues
3. 2.1  Identification  of  scratches  is  typically  done  (in
part)   through   software   that   identifies   a   string   of
connected  LLS  signals.    Defects  with  dimensions  such
that  the  length  is  at  least  five  times  the  width  are
defined  as  scratches.    Customers  and  suppliers  may
agree on scratch aspect ratios different from 5:1.  SSIS
software   often   provides   a   customer-settable   aspect
ratio,  as  well  as  a  minimum  overall  length,  as  criteria
for  classification  of  an  SSIS  defect  or  group  of  defects
as   a   scratch.      Depending   on   SSIS   design,   scratch
sensitivity may also be a function of scratch orientation.
Currently,  scratch  signals  are  also  calibrated  in  latex
sphere   equivalents;   however,   in   the   future   it   may
become   useful   to   calibrate   scratch   signals   with   a
standard  obtained  from  a  scratch  that  has  been  either


SEMI M35-1104 © SEMI 1999, 2004 2
manufactured  to  a  known  size,  or  has  been  measured
via AFM.
3. 2.2  Haze  is  specified  as  parts  per  million  (ppm)  of
measured   scattered   optical   power   relative   to   the
incident  optical  power  on  the  surface.    All  of  the
associated  measurement  conditions  must  be  given  (or
implied)   with   the   specified   haze   value.      These
conditions  include:  source  incident  angle  (measured  as
a polar angle from surface normal), source polarization
(S,  P,  other),  source  wavelength  (or  wavelength  band),
nominal  source  spot  size  at  the  wafer,  haze  collection
angles  (given  as  solid  angles  with  directions).    All  of
these  quantities  must  be  part  of  a  haze  specification,
either  by  description,  or  by  implication  to  specific
instrumentation (with known or fixed parameters).
3. 2.3  Haze  is  quantified  by  measuring  scattered  light
power   over   one   or   more   solid   angles   and   then
normalizing by the light power incident on the surface.
It  is  nothing  more  than  the  diffuse  reflectance  of  a
surface  in  specified  directions  for  a  known  source
(incident   angle,   polarization,   spot   size,   wavelength
band)  and  receiver  (or  detector)  configuration  (solid
angles  and  locations).    Measured  haze  can  be  expected
to  change  if  the  surface  is  changed,  or  if  any  of  the
measurement parameters change.
3. 2.4  Under special conditions, where the source of the
haze  is  known,  it  may  be  possible  to  use  a  model  to
predict  the  haze  reading  on  one  instrument  from  the
haze reading on another.  For example, if on the basis of
product experience and measurements on a few wafers,
the  surface  power  spectral  density  function  can  be
determined, then the haze due to surface roughness can
be    calculated    for    an    instrument    with    different
parameters.    Haze  caused  by  a  large  number  of  small
particles  and/or  film  contamination  is  more  difficult  to
model.
3. 2.5  An  SSIS  often  reports  haze  as  the  arithmetic
average of a grid of local haze measurements taken over
the  FQA.    This  average  can  be,  and  often  is,  biased  by
wafer  haze  distributions  that  exhibit  long,  positively
skewed  tails.    SSIS  software  is  being  developed  that
automatically  calculates  other  haze  statistics,  such  as
the  median  haze  value,  the  standard  deviation  of  the
haze distribution, and so on.
3. 3  The  SSIS  used  for  automated  inspection  of  silicon
wafer  surfaces  should  be  calibrated  in  terms  of  latex
sphere  equivalents  in  accordance  with  SEMI  M53  or
another   method   agreed   upon   between   supplier   and
customer.
4  Limitations
4. 1  The  following  measurement  considerations  impose
limitations on the guidelines.
4. 1.1  Histograms calculated in latex sphere equivalents
may be distorted, because a given surface has in general
LLSs of different size, shape, and material.
4. 1.2  Measurement results do not always compare well
between   systems,   because   different   SSIS   designs
employ  different  geometries  and  gather  light  scattered
in  different  directions.    Haze  maps  may  have  different
levels and localized surface features may have different
calculated sizes.
4. 1.3  All  scanning  systems  have  a  minimum  LSE  size
of  LLSs  that  can  be  reliably  mapped  and  sized.    The
limitation  is  due  to  a  combination  of  system  electrical
noise  and  the  detection  of  non-particle  light  scatter
signals,  such  as  those  created  by  Rayleigh  scatter,
surface  roughness  and  system  optics.    Operation  near
this noise floor limits the utility of this guide for LLSs
of those sizes.
4. 1.4  Measurements  made  near  the  wafer  edge  often
result in large numbers of false counts called edge blast.
These counts are caused by small amounts of stray light
propagating near the incident beam that scatter from the
relatively  rough  wafer  edge  back  into  the  detector
optics.    Under  certain  combinations  of  sensitivity  and
edge  exclusion,  light  scattered  from  these  effects  may
cause false counts within the FQA.
4. 1.5  Types  of  LLS  signals  that  may  be  mis-identified
as scratches include lines of particles, pits, false counts,
stacking faults, slip, and spin dry residue.
4. 1.6  Closely  spaced  features  may  be  counted  as  a
single scattering event because the scanning spot size is
generally much larger than the feature diameter.
4. 1.7  Scratch    orientation    usually    affects    scanner
response.    Thus  the  minimum  detectable  scratch  cross-
section may vary with orientation.

SEMI M1 and/or SEMI MF1241.
6. 2  Other terms are defined as follows:
6. 2.1  extended light scatterer (XLS)
⎯ a feature larger
than  the  spatial  resolution  of  the  inspection  equipment,
on  or  in  a  wafer  surface,  resulting  in  increased  light

4  Apparatus
4. 1  Microscope - Measuring field  should be 1 mm
2
or
larger.
NOTE:  For  accurate  EPD  measurement,  accurate  area  of  the
measuring field should be measured by a standard scale.
5  Procedure
5. 1  The counting positions for 50  mm diameter wafers
and  for  76  mm  diameter  wafers  are  shown  in  Figure  1
and  Figure  2  respectively.  The  counting  points  are
located  in  the  center  of  each  mesh.  In  the  case  of  a  50
mm  diameter  wafer  the  mesh  size  is  5  mm.  The  total
number  of  counting  positions  is  69  and  position  35  is
located at the center of the wafer. In the case of 76 mm
diameter  wafer  the  mesh  size  is  10  mm,  and  the  total
number   of   counting   position   is   37.   Position   19   is
located at the center of the wafer.
5. 2   Count  and  record  the  number  o f  etch  pits  for
which  the  cores  are  in  the  measuring  field.  If  the  pits
are  crowded  and  are  difficult  to  count,  increase  the
magnification. After that count the etch pits and record
the results as well as the microscope magnification.
5. 3    Repeat   Section   5.3   for   all   othe r   positions,   2
through  69  positions  in  the  case  of  50  mm  diameter
wafers and 2 through 37 positions in the case of 76 mm
diameter wafers.
6  Calculations
6. 1  The EPD in each measuring fi eld is the number of
pits counted divided by the area.
EPD = (Number of pits) / Area
For example, if the size of measuring field is exactly 1
mm × 1 mm, the area is 0.01 cm
2
.
7  Report
7. 1   There  are  several  forms  that  ar e  possible  for
reporting the EPD, for example the average EPD of all
the positions or the area less than some specified value
or map of EPD for the entire wafer, etc. An appropriate
report form should be decided between the supplier and
the user.
