5  Analytical Procedures
NOTE    1:    Samples    of    octafluorocyclobutane    should    be
equilibrated  at  no  less  than  30°C  (85°F)  for  at  least  24  hours
prior   to   analysis   to   ensure   adequate   vapor   pressure   for
analysis and consistency.
5. 1  Acidity  ó  This  procedure  is  for  the  determination
of acidity in octafluorocyclobutane utilizing an aqueous
conductivity   measurement.      Calculations   are   made
relating  sample  conductivity  to  free  acidity,  calculated
as hydrochloric acid, in the sample.
5. 1.1  Detection Limit ó 30 ppb as HCl.
5. 1.2  Apparatus:    A  conductivity  bridge  and  cell,  heat
gun,  graduated  cylinders,  gas  dispersion  tube,  wide-
mouth    polyethylene    bottle,    hypodermic    syringes,
polyethylene beaker, water purification system.
5. 1.3  Reagents
5. 1.3.1  Hydrochloric acid, 0.01 N standard in SDA-2B
ethyl  alcohol  (store  the  standard  in  separate  50-mL
serum capped vials).
5. 1.3.2    CFC-11,  special  (analyzed  to  have  an  aqueous
conductance  of  <  0.5  μmho/cm).      If  CFC-11  is  not
available,    a    similar    degreasing    solvent    can    be
substituted, such as HFC-43-10.
5. 1.3.3        Distilled    and    de-ionized    water,    aqueous
conductivity  <  0.5  μmho/cm,  prepared  immediately
prior  to  use  by  passing  distilled  water  through  a  water
purification system and analyzing it with a conductivity
bridge.  DO NOT STORE DE-IONIZED WATER FOR
USE IN THIS ANALYSIS.
5. 1.3.4  RBS-35 cleaner.
5. 1.4  Operating Procedure
5. 1.4.1      Attach   a   suitable   regulator   to   the   cylinder
outlet.


SEMI C3.58-0303 © SEMI 2000, 2003 2
5. 1.4.2  Conductivity     bridge/cell     ó     Store     the
conductivity  cell  in  a  polyethylene  beaker  containing
de-ionized water when not in use.
5. 1.4.3  Calibration
5. 1.4.3.1  Add CFC-11 to the 20 mL calibration mark of
the  polyethylene  (PE)  bottle.    Immediately  cap  the
bottle  and  shake  contents  vigorously  for  approximately
30 seconds.  Discard the CFC-11.
5. 1.4.3.2    Fill  the  bottle  again  with  CFC-11  to  the  20
mL mark.  Immediately add 100 mL of de-ionized (DI)
water   to   the   bottle,   cap   and   shake   vigorously   for
approximately 120 seconds.
5. 1.4.3.3  Rinse the conductivity cell with DI water and
shake   it   dry.      Uncap   the   PE   bottle   and   dip   the
conductivity cell into the water layer (top layer).  Read
and  record  the  conductivity  value.    This  reading  will
serve as the ìBLANKî value.  Remove the conductivity
cell from the solution, rinse with DI water and store in a
beaker  containing  DI  water.    Immediately  cap  the  PE
bottle.
5. 1.4.3.4    Fill  and  flush  a  clean,  dry,  50  microliter
syringe   several   times   with   the   0.01   N   standard,
hydrochloric  acid  in  SDA-2B  ethanol.    Fill  the  syringe
to  a  volume  of  30  microliters.    Holding  the  syringe
vertically with needle pointing up, tap the barrel gently
to permit air bubbles to rise to the top.  Slowly depress
the plunger until the plunger tip is aligned exactly with
the  20  microliter  mark.    Immediately  uncap  the  PE
bottle  and  inject  the  syringe  contents  into  the  bottle.
Immediately cap the bottle.  Shake the bottle vigorously
for  approximately  120  seconds.    Uncap  the  PE  bottle
and dip the conductivity cell into the water layer.  Read
and   record   the   conductivity   value.      Remove   the
conductivity cell from the solution, rinse with DI water
and store in a beaker containing DI water.
5. 1.4.3.5  Calculate the nanograms (ng) of hydrochloric
acid used in the standard from the following equation:

ng HCl  =   V  ◊  N  ◊  MEQ  ◊  10
9

10

Where:  ng HCl  =  nanograms of HCl in
the standard

V  =  HCl volume, microliters

N  =  HCl normality

MEQ  =  HCl milliequivalent weight
(g/meq)  =  0.036461

5. 1.4.3.6  Calculate the calibration factor as follows:

ng                      HCl/μmho  =   A

(C2-C1)

Where:                      ng                      HCl/μmho  =  calibration
factor

A  =  ng HCl in standard

C1  =  blank conductivity, μmho

C2  =  standard conductivity, μmho

5. 1.4.3.7    Repeat  procedure  at  least  six  times.    Use  the
average   of   the   six   calibration   factors   for   sample
calculations.
5. 1.4.4  Samplying and Analysis
5. 1.4.4.1    Add  CFC-11  or  a  similar  degreasing  solvent
to the 20 mL calibration mark of the polyethylene (PE)
bottle.    Immediately  cap  the  bottle  and  shake  contents
vigorously  for  approximately  30  seconds.    Discard  the
CFC-11.
5. 1.4.4.2    Fill  the  bottle  again  with  CFC-11  to  the  20
mL mark.  Immediately add 100 mL of DI water to the
bottle, cap and shake vigorously for approximately 120
seconds.
5. 1.4.4.3  Rinse the conductivity cell with DI water and
shake   it   dry.      Uncap   the   PE   bottle   and   dip   the
conductivity cell into the water layer (top layer).  Read
and  record  the  conductivity  value.    This  reading  will
serve as the ìBLANKî value.  Remove the conductivity
cell from the solution, rinse with DI water and store in a
beaker  containing  DI  water.    Immediately  cap  the  PE
bottle.
5. 1.4.5    Weigh  the  sample  cylinder  and  record.    Attach
PE  gas  dispersion  tube  to  the  sample  cylinder  valve.
Uncap  the  PE  bottle  and  lower  the  gas  dispersion  tube
into  the  water.    Open  the  cylinder  valve  and  purge
sample  through  the  bottle  such  that  about  150  g  of
sample are added to the bottle over a 60 minute period.
Close  the  cylinder  valve  and  immediately  remove  the
gas dispersion tube and cap the bottle.  Record the final
weight of the capped sample cylinder.
5. 1.4.6          Shake     the     PE     bottle     vigorously     for
approximately   120   seconds.      Read   and   record   the
conductivity value as done previously.

4. 5   Assay  of  Oxygen  —  This  procedure  describes  the
assay  of  oxygen  using  an  “Orsat”  device.  This  is  a
volumetric   determination   of   nonabsorbable/reactable
gas.
4. 5.1   Method Capability — 99.9% Oxygen.
4. 5.2   Instrument Parameters — See Diagram A.
4. 5.2.1   Equipment:

# 1

1.   1-100 mL calibrated certified buret, calibrated every
0. 1  mL  for  the  top  5  mL  equipped  with  a  3-way
stopcock on the top.

# 2

2.   3-250 mL aspirator bottles.

# 3

3.   1 one-hole rubber stop.

# 4

4.   1-1/16  in  OD  soft  copper  wire  made  into  hollow
coils 3/8 in OD by 3/4 in long.

# 5

5.   Sufficient 3/8 in OD tygon tubing.

# 6

6.   Sufficient surgical rubber tubing.

# 7

7.   1 gallon distilled water.

# 8

8.   2 lbs technical grade ammonium chloride.

# 9

9.   1 gallon 27% ammonium hydroxide.
4. 5.2.2   Test Solution Preparation
4. 5.2.2.1    Two  pounds  of  technical  grade  ammonium
chloride  are  dissolved  in  one  gallon  of  distilled  water
and stored in a glass jar. One-half gallon of this solution
shall   be   combined   with   one-half   gallon   of   27%
ammonium hydroxide.
4. 5.3   Equipment  Assembly  —  The  equipment  is  to  be
assembled,  as  per  Diagram  A,  in  a  suitable  wood  or
metal   frame   so   arranged   that   the   aspirator   bottle
connected  to  the  buret  can  be  raised  and  lowered,  as
required, to transfer the gas being analyzed to and from
the  center  aspirator  bottle  which  is  filled  with  copper
coils. The two leveling bottles should be filled half full
of  testing  solution  and  the  buret  and  aspirator  bottle,
which  contains  the  copper  coils,  should  be  completely
filled.
4. 5.4   Operating Procedure
4. 5.4.1    Before  analyzing  the  sample,  perform  a  series
of  analyses  using  a  source  of  oxygen  of  which  the
purity  has  been  previously  determined.  This  procedure
is   necessary   to   age   the   test   solution   properly   and
eliminate any air bubbles which may become trapped in
the  apparatus.  Only  after  three  consecutive  analyses
have been run, indicating the known purity, should you
proceed with testing. (See Note 7.)
4. 5.4.2    Attach  rubber  tubing  from  the  regulator  of  the
cylinder  being  tested  to  the  stopcock  of  the  buret.
Rotate  the  stopcock  so  as  to  draw  the  sample  into  the
gas measuring buret. Collect a little more than 100 mL
(i.e., below the zero mark) in the buret, and then rotate
the  stopcock  so  as  to  shut  off  the  oxygen  flow  and
remove  the  rubber  tubing  attached  to  the  intake  of  the
buret.  If  the  gas  sample  in  the  buret  is  below  the  zero
mark  raise  the  leveling  bottle  #1  so  that  its  “water”
level is even atmosphere so as to raise the “water” level
in the buret to exactly zero (Diagram B, Fig. #1).
4. 5.4.3    Rotate  the  stopcock  to  connect  the  aspirator
bottle  #3  containing  the  copper  coils,  and  transfer  the
oxygen into this aspirator bottle by raising the leveling
bottle   #1   (Diagram   B,   Fig.   #2).   Invert   bottle   #3
containing the copper coils so that both the inlet stopper
and  the  sided  outlet  are  in  a  downward  position  and
shake gently for 1 to 2 minutes. Stand test bottle #3 on
its base and lower the leveling bottle so as to withdraw
any   residual   gases   into   the   gas   measuring   buret
(Diagram  B,  Fig.  #3).  Transfer  at  least  25  to  30  mL  of
test  solution  from  the  left-hand  leveling  bottle  #2  into
the right-hand leveling bottle #l, through the copper coil
bottle  #3,  and  the  gas  buret  while,  at  the  same  time,
gently  rocking  and  tapping  the  center  bottle  (Diagram
B,  Fig.  #4).  This  will  move  any  bubbles  which  might
cling to the copper coil into the gas measuring buret.
4. 5.4.4    Turn  the  stopcock  off  and  raise  the  leveling
bottle #l so that its liquid level is the same as the liquid
level  inside  the  upper  portion  of  the  gas  buret.  When
the levels of the leveling bottle and the gas buret are the
same,  read  the  gas  purity  markings  on  the  buret  at  the
liquid level at this point.
4. 5.5   Maintenance
4. 5.5.1   Copper coils should be added to the test bottle
as required to keep the bottles completely full. The gas
buret  should  be  kept  clean  with  a  strong  detergent
solution to eliminate drops of liquid that might hang up
in  the  gas  space  and  give  incorrect  purity  readings.  No
readings  should  be  taken  when  the  space  above  the
liquid  level  of  the  gas  buret  has  any  liquid  drops
hanging  in  it,  as  this  will  give  an  erroneous  purity
reading.
4. 5.5.2    The  solution  must  be  replaced  occasionally  as
it  becomes  exhausted.  The  necessity  of  replacement
may be determined when the color begins to turn green,
and by the increased length of shaking time required to
get  a  minimum  acceptable  purity  from  the  oxygen  in  a
cylinder of known purity. Suspect an exhausted solution
if  analysis  of  a  cylinder  of  known  purity  does  not  read
the correct purity.



SEMI C3.22-1000 © SEMI 1983, 2004 4
4. 5.6   Standardization
4. 5.6.1    The  method  of  analysis  stated  above  can  be
used as a primary standard, meaning cylinders analyzed
by    this    method    can    be    used    as    standards    of
measurement  on  electronic  analyzers  used  to  measure
oxygen.
4. 5.6.2   This method is specific to oxygen when carbon
dioxide  is  not  present  in  the  sample  gas.  When  carbon
dioxide is one of the components of the sample gas, the
carbon dioxide must first be scrubbed from the sample.
4. 6   Notes
Note  1:  The  0–1  range  can  be  used  provided  that  zero
and span gas standards in oxygen with known levels of
hydrocarbons   between   0–1   ppm   are   used   in   the
calibration of the analyzer.
Note 2: As the flow rate and heat capacity of the matrix
gas  affect  the  instrument  output,  the  zero  and  span  gas
matrices must coincide with that of the sample gas.
Note  3:  The  effective  response  of  a  flame  ionization
detector-equipped    total    hydrocarbon    analyzer    to
different    hydrocarbons    can    vary    and    must    be
approximated.   However,   the   response   of   the   most
common   hydrocarbon   impurities   in   oxygen   can   be
accurately totaled and compared to methane.
Note  4:  The  sampling  system  and  hygrometer  must  be
designed  to  operate  under  the  sample  pressure,  or  the
sample  pressure  must  be  reduced  (by  a  regulator  with
diaphragm  of  stainless  steel  or  other  suitable  material)
to   accommodate   the   pressure   restrictions   of   the
analytical hygrometer.
Note   5:   The   National   Institute   of   Standards   and
Technology (NIST) provides calibration services for the
thermometers used in dewpoint/frostpoint hygrometers.
Note   6:   This   method   is   not   applicable   if   other
constituents  in  the  gas  will  condense  before  water
vapor, e.g., carbon dioxide and/or oil contamination.
Note    7:    This    procedure    will    be    required    only
immediately    after    changing    the    test    solution    or
contaminating the apparatus with air.

exposed  to  ambient  moisture,  it  must  be  purged  with
dry gas prior to use.
4. 7.4.2    Flow  the  sample  gas  through  the  hygrometer
until  the  sampling  system  and  instrument  have  reached
equilibrium with the gas.
4. 7.4.3    After  equilibrium  has  been  reached,  cool  the
mirror    of    the    hygrometer,    as    specified    by    its
manufacturer,  to  determine  the  dewpoint/frostpoint  of
the sample gas.
4. 7.4.4    Verify  the  dewpoint/frostpoint  reading  for  at
least 30 minutes after it becomes stable.
4. 7.4.5    Correct  the  dewpoint/frostpoint  reading  to  1
atm  pressure.  Convert  it  to  ppm  (vol/vol)  using  an
appropriate   table.   The   result   may   not   exceed   the
specification in Section 2 of this standard.
4. 8   Notes
Note  1:  Introduce  the  calibration  standard  as  many
times as necessary to achieve the desired precision.
Note  2:  All  gases  used  in  the  analysis  of  the  sample
should  not  contain  more  than  10%  of  the  specified
value  of  the  component  of  interest,  unless  otherwise
stated.
Note 3: A flow restrictor should be installed on the vent
from port 8 to match the pressure drop of the detector.
Note  4:  A  flow  controller  is  required  on  each  carrier
inlet.
Note  5:  An  example  of  an  operating  procedure  is
outlined  below  for  the  sample  system  shown  in  Figure
1. This procedure is appropriate only when the infrared
gas  cell  is  designed  to  withstand  the  200  psig  sample
pressure.
Note  6:  Operating  procedures  for  other  non-dispersive
infrared  analyzers  vary  depending  on  manufacturer.
Refer  to  individual  instrument  vendor  instructions  in
each case.
Note 7: As the flow rate and heat capacity of the matrix
gas  affect  the  instrument  output,  the  zero  and  span  gas
matrices must coincide with that of the sample gas.
Note  8:  The  effective  response  of  a  flame  ionization
detector-equipped  total  hydrocarbon  analyzer  can  vary
among     different     hydrocarbons     and     must     be
approximated.   However,   the   response   of   the   most
common   hydrocarbon   impurities   can   be   accurately
totaled and compared to methane.
Note  9:  The  sampling  system  and  hygrometer  must  be
designed  to  operate  at  the  sample  pressure,  or  the
sample  pressure  must  be  reduced  by  a  regulator  with  a
diaphragm of stainless steel or other suitable material.

NOTE  1:    Before  performing  this  or  any  other  analytical
operation it is necessary to perform the following:
• Familiarize  yourself  with  the  products  involved  and  the
potential   hazards   by   consulting   the   MSDS's   for   all
hazardous  substances  involved  and  by  consulting  the
CGA’s  “Handbook  of  Compressed  Gases”  for  all  gases
involved.
• Know how to safely handle and store each hazardous gas
by consulting the applicable CGA pamphlets.
• Use  all  necessary  and  applicable  personal  protective
equipment.
• Follow  all  instructions  relative  to  the  safe  operation  of
the equipment by consulting the LAC Safety Manual and
applicable equipment manufacturers manual(s).
It must be noted that silane is a pyrophoric gas and all sample
plumbing must be purged of air completely before introducing
silane.    Extra  special  attention  must  be  paid  to  leak  checking
all  connections  and  checking  the  vent  plumbing  to  be  certain
that   effluents   are   vented   properly.      If   there   are   any

SEMI C3.55-0200 © SEMI 20005
questionable connections or leaks, report this to the supervisor
immediately and do not proceed with the analysis.
NOTE 2:  Introduce the calibration standard as many times as
necessary  to  achieve  the  desired  precision.    Detection  limit
calculated  on  these  calibrations  should  achieve  at  least  that
listed for this procedure.

4. 3  Notes
NOTE 1: Tungsten   hexafluoride   interferes   with   the   direct
absorbance  reading  for  silicon  tetrafluoride.  The  absorbance
for silicon tetrafluoride is determined by compensating for the
interfering    absorbance    from    the    tungsten    hexafluoride.
Compensation   is   made   by   subtracting   the   absorbance
contributed to this band by tungsten hexafluoride band at 930
cm
-1
. This absorbance is halved and subtracted from the total
peak   absorbance   at   1040   cm
-1
,   resulting   in   the   peak
absorbance for silicon tetrafluoride.
NOTE 2: Actual  detection  limits  will  be  determined  by  the
noise level and the resolution of the spectrometer. One way is
to  reduce  the  noise  level  is  to  use  a  Fourier  Transform
Infrared Spectrometer.
NOTE 3: All  gases  used  in  the  analysis  of  the  sample  should
not  contain  more  than  10%  of  the  specified  value  of  the
component of interest, unless otherwise stated.
NOTE 4: As  tungsten  hexafluoride  has  a  low  vapor  pressure,
the cylinder should be kept at room temperature (20°C) for at
least 8 hours prior to analysis.
NOTE 5: Observe  proper  safety  procedures  for  handling  and
disposing of tungsten hexafluoride.
NOTE 6: Prior to introducing tungsten hexafluoride purge the
sample  lines  and  instrument  tubing  with  helium  to  remove
moisture.
NOTE 7: Upon completing the analysis, cap off the manifold
and instrument lines or purge the system with helium.

Other  elements  can  be  analyzed  using  a  single  point
calibration.    Elements  for  which  stable  standards  can
not  be  obtained,  can  be  analyzed  using  interpolation
and  a  knowledge  of  the  instrument  response  function.
The  ICPMS  should  be  calibrated  using  matrix  matched
multielement  standards.    At  least  one  spiked  sample
should  be  analyzed  as  part  of  the  analytical  procedure.
The recovery of the spikes should be within ± 25%.  At
least three standards and a blank should be used for the
calibration.  Regression based approach should be used
to calculate the response factors. The limit of detection
(LOD)   should   be   calculated   following   SEMI   C10,
Guide for Determination of Method Detection Limits.

PARTICLE SPECIFICATION FOR GRADE 20/0.2 HYDROGEN (H
2
)
DELIVERED AS PIPELINE GAS
This specification was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility of
the North American Gases Committee.  Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards
Committee on October 25, 2002.  Initially available at www.semi.org December 2002; to be published March

# 2003

2003.  Originally published in 1989.
1  Purpose
1. 1    The  purposes  of  this  document  are  (1)  to  set  a
maximum  permissible  particle  concentration  for  Grade
20/0.2  hydrogen  gas  and  (2)  to  describe  a  reference
method for its verification.
2  Scope
2. 1      This   document   applies   only   to   hydrogen   gas
delivered   through   pipelines;   it   is   not   applicable   to
cylinder gases or gases in their liquid state.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Referenced Standards
None.
4  Terminology
4. 1  Definitions
4. 1.1  background count — The total number of counts
registered by a specific particle counter within the time
needed  to  sample  1.0  SCF  of  gas  under  conditions
where  zero  particles  transverse  the  sensing  volume,
averaged   over   at   least   a   sequence   of   twenty-four
consecutive  sampling  periods  of  1.0  SCF  each  or  eight
consecutive  periods  of  30  minutes  each,  whichever  is
longer.    The  background  count  is  to  be  reported  as
mean number of count per SCF; the number of hours on
which the average is based is also reported.
4. 1.2  gas sample volume — The volume of the sample,
expressed  in  standard  cubic  feet  (SCF)  is  the  volume
occupied  by  the  gas  sample  at  standard  conditions,
20°C (68°F) and 1.00 atmosphere pressure.
4. 1.3  particle  concentration  —  The  total  number  of
particles   counted,   divided   by   the   total   gas   sample
volume, and corrected for background count as defined
in  Section  4.1.1,  rounded  to  the  nearest  integer,  for
particles equal to or larger than the specified size.
4. 1.4  particle   size/particle   diameter   —   The   optical
equivalent   diameter   as   detected   by   a   given   light
scattering particle counter.
NOTE 1:  The optical equivalent diameter varies from counter
to  counter  and  with  differing  particle  shape  and  refractive
index.
4. 1.5  sampling  period  —  The  time  needed  to  sample
1. 0 SCF or 30 minutes, whichever is longer.
5  Apparatus
5. 1  Light  Scattering  Optical  Particle  Counter  —  With
a lower detection limit of 0.2 micrometers or less, based
on  a  calibration  with  polystyrene  latex  spheres;  and
with  a  maximum  background  of  2  counts/SCF  at  0.2
micrometers.  It should be suitable for use in hydrogen
service per the manufacturer's specifications or encased
in an explosion-proof enclosure which satisfies Class I,
Division I of the NFPA Code.
6  Test Method
NOTE  2:    The  precise  details  of  any  sampling  configuration,
measurement    procedure,    or    any    instrument    calibration
procedure  and  frequency  must  be  agreed  upon  between  user
and supplier, taking into account good engineering practice.
6. 1    The  sampling  point  should  be  as  close  as  practical
to the downstream side of the supplier's final gas filter.
Sampling lines should be as short as possible.
6. 2        Suggested    sampling    probe    configuration    for
turbulent main line flow:
Alternative a: Figure 1a (preferred)
Alternative b: Figure 1b
Alternative c: Figure 1c
Alternative d: Figure 1d
6. 3    For  configurations  1a,  1b,  and  1c,  the  flow  rate  in
the  sampling  tube  at  pipeline  pressure  should  be  set  so
that  the  mean  sampling  flow  velocity  at  the  probe  inlet
matches as closely as possible the axial flow velocity in
the pipeline.  Sampling tube ID should be no less than 2
mm (0.08 in).


SEMI C6.3-89 © SEMI 1989, 2003 2
6. 4    Determine  the  background  count  for  the  particle
counter by using the standard method recommended by
the instrument manufacturer using hydrogen gas.
7  Specification
7. 1      Maximum   permissible   total   concentration:   20
particles   per   SCF   equal   to   or   larger   than   0.2
micrometers,   after   subtracting   background   count   as
defined in Section 4.1.1.
7. 2    The  specification  will  be  considered  as  met,  if  the
particle  concentration  does  not  exceed  20  particles  per
SCF   in   any   five   consecutive   sampling   periods   as
defined in Section 4.1.5.
8  Report
8. 1      Report   each   of   the   five   consecutive   sampling
periods to read as total number of particles per SCF7 of
gas,  equal  to  or  larger  than  0.2  micrometers  optical
equivalent  diameter,  without  reference  to  any  specific
size  distribution  function.    The  background  count  shall
be reported as defined in Section 4.1.1.
9  Calibration
9. 1    The  optical  particle  counter  is  normally  calibrated
using latex spheres of a known diameter suspended in a
gas.    Since  the  gas  density  and  refractive  index  enter
into    the    amount    of    scattering    detected    by    the
instrument, hydrogen should be used for calibration.
10  Safety
10. 1    The  lower  explosive  limit  (LEL)  for  hydrogen  in
air is 4%; therefore, proper precautions should be taken
to  insure  that  the  maximum  possible  concentration  of
hydrogen  in  air  does  not  exceed  2%.    The  particle
counter  and  any  other  ancillary  equipment  must  be
checked   for   leaks   and   the   hydrogen   exiting   the
equipment  must  be  disposed  of  appropriately  to  insure
that its concentration in air at any point does not exceed
2%.

and sampling lines should be as short as possible.
5. 3      A   suggested   sampling   probe   configuration   for
turbulent main line flow is shown in Figure 2. The flow
rate in the sampling tube at pipeline pressure should be
set so that the mean sampling flow velocity at the probe
inlet  matches  as  closely  as  possible  the  axial  flow
velocity  in  the  pipeline.  The  pitot  sampling  tube  ID
should  be  no  less  than  2  mm  (0.08  inch).  The  orifice
and  sampling  horn  should  be  sized  so  that  the  mean

of a Gaussian (Normal) distribution.
4  Apparatus
4. 1  Particle  Counter  —  An  instrument  suitable  for
counting  particles  in  gaseous  nitrogen  or  argon  with  a
lower  detection  limit  of  0.2  micrometers  or  less,  based
on calibration with polystyrene latex spheres.

4. 2  Pressure  Reducer  —  An  accessory  required  for
counters  operated  at  atmospheric  pressure,  it  should
preferably  use  expansion  of  the  gas  through  a  critical
orifice.
5  Test Method
NOTE      2:            The      details      of      sampling      configuration,
measurement procedure, and instrument calibration procedure
and frequency must be agreed upon by the user and supplier,
taking into account good engineering practice.
5. 1    Determine  the  average  observed  concentration  of
counts in the background (
B
X) by passing air, nitrogen
or   argon,   believed   to   be   free   of   particles   of   0.2
micrometers    or    more    in    diameter,    through    the
instrument and recording the total number of counts. A
suggested assemby for perfoming this test, using a filter
which  removes  particles  in  this  size  range,  is  shown  in
Figure  1.  A  method  recommended  by  the  instrument
manufacturer,  such  as  internal  recirculation  through  a
filter, may be substituted for the system shown. Count a
minimum of 8 sample intervals, each at least the time to
sample  25  standard  liters  (0.95  SCF)  or  30  minutes,
whichever   is   greater.   Calculate
B
X   as   defined   in
Section  3.
B
X  must  not  exceed  2  particles  per  25
standard liters.
5. 2    The  sampling  point  should  be  at  outlet  of  system,
and sampling lines should be as short as possible.
5. 3      A   suggested   sampling   probe   configuration   for
turbulent main line flow is shown in Figure 2. The flow
rate in the sampling tube at pipeline pressure should be
set so that the mean sampling flow velocity at the probe
inlet  matches  as  closely  as  possible  the  axial  flow
velocity  in  the  pipeline.  The  pitot  sampling  tube  ID
should  be  no  less  than  2  mm  (0.08  inch).  The  orifice
and  sampling  horn  should  be  sized  so  that  the  mean
flow velocity at the particle counter probe inlet matches
the   axial   flow   velocity   in   the   horn   as   closely   as
possible.
5. 4    Count  the  particles  in  each  of  at  least  8  sample
intervals. Each sample interval must be at least the time
to sample 25 standard liters or 30 minutes, whichever is
greater.  Record  the  number  of  counts  and  the  sample
volume  for  each  interval.  Calculate
C
X  and  S
C
,  as
defined in Section 3.
6  Specification
6. 1  Maximum  Permissible  Particle  Concentration  —
10 particles per 25 standard liters as determined by the
instrument specified in Section 4.
6. 2    The  specification  will  be  considered  met  if  the
calculated  concentration  of  particles  plus  two  standard
deviations does not exceed 10 particles per 25 standard
liters, i.e.:
