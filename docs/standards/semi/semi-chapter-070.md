SEMI E134-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 4 6 Conventions6.1 Terms6.1.1 Class, Data Type, Stereotype Name  This specification uses the terms class, data type, type, or theclass stereotype name interchangeably to refer to a UML class.6.1.2 Consumer  This specification uses the term consumer to refer to any software entity that uses theDataCollectionManager interface to manage data collection on the equipment.6.1.3 Built-in DCP  This specification uses the term built-in DCP to refer to pre-defined DCPs that areprovided with the equipment. Built-in DCPs can be activated by any consumer, but can not be changed or deletedby any consumer. See Section 11.1.2.1 for details.6.1.4 Reporting, Buffering, Sending  This specification uses the term reporting to refer to the act of collectingevent, exception, or trace data values to later be sent to a consumer. The term buffering is used to refer to the actof storing a data report on the equipment for some period of time before sending to a consumer. The term sendingis used to refer to the act of sending a report to a consumer.6.2 Notation6.2.1 Unified Modeling Language Notation  All class and sequence diagrams in this specification make use of theUnified Modeling Language notation.6.2.1.1 UML Stereotypes  This specification uses the following stereotypes in class diagrams: &lt;\&gt;  Classes with this stereotype identify an abstract privilege concept that grants permission to aconsumer to perform an activity or operation. &lt;\&gt;  Classes with this stereotype define a collection of operations and their semantics. It is theresponsibility of the equipment and its consumers, where specified, to provide implementations of these classes. &lt;\&gt;  Classes with this stereotype identify data types that have a finite set of discrete values thatcan be assumed by instances of the class.6.2.2 UML Associations  The mechanism used for realizing UML associations between classes is implementationdependent. This document is abstract in nature, and does not specify or imply any such mechanism. Any adjunctstandard that provides an implementation of this specification must include a description of the mechanism used forrepresenting the UML associations shown in this document.

Unadorned associations are not used,for economy of notation. All role names are public by default, therefore the visibility symbols are not used. See theUML 1.4 specification, Section 3.43 for details.

SEMI E134-0305 © SEMI 2004, 20055 6.2.3.1 Open diamond adornments indicate that instances of the target class may be shared among aggregateclasses. Closed diamond adornments indicate that target instances belong to at most one composite class. The part-whole semantics of the aggregation/composition symbol is not significant in this specification. See the UML 1.4specification, Sections 3.43.2.5 and 3.48 for further information.6.2.3.2 Some diagrams use the UML ordered or XOR constraints where applicable. An ordered constraint onan association indicates that the order in which the target instances appear in the aggregation is semanticallysignificant, and is described in the supporting text of the diagram. See the UML 1.4 specification, Section 3.43.2.2for further information.6.2.3.3 An XOR constraint indicates that only one of many possible associations can be instantiated at any onetime for a given instance of the association class. See the UML 1.4 specification, Section 3.42.5.1 for furtherinformation.6.2.4 Association Tables  The table below provides an example of the tables used to list and describe associationsbetween classes defined in this specification.Table 1 Association Table Format AssociationRole NameDefinition Comments 6.2.4.1 Association Role Name  The name of the association role being specified.6.2.4.2 Definition  Describes the function or purpose of the association.6.2.4.3 Comments  Any additional comments or notes regarding the association.6.2.5 Attribute Tables  The table below provides an example of the tables used to list and describe attributes ofclasses defined in this specification.Table 2 Attribute Table FormatAttribute Name Definition FormSee list below 6.2.5.1 Form  Defines the data type of the attribute. The terms used to describe data types in this column aredefined in the SEMI Compilation of Terms, or are included as part of the specification. Refer to the compilation ofterms for the definition of SEMI type name meanings.6.2.6 Operation Definition Tables  The table below provides an example of the tables used to list and describe theinterface operations defined in this specification.Table 3 Operation DefinitionOperation Description Type Requestor/Sender Responder/ReceiverSee list below 6.2.6.1 Operation  Specifies the name of the operation.6.2.6.2 Type  Specifies the messaging semantics of the operation. Only Request-Reply (RR) and Fire-and-Forget(FF) semantics are used in this specification. Request-Reply messages are messages that involve an initiator and areceiver. In a Request-Reply exchange, the initiator sends a single request message to the receiver, and the receiversends a single reply message to that request back to the initiator. Fire-and-Forget messages are messages thatinvolve a sender and a receiver. In a Fire-and-Forget exchange, the sender sends a single message to the receiver,with no associated response.6.2.6.3 Requestor/Sender  For RR semantics, identifies the entity that makes the request, for FF semantics,identifies the entity that sends the message. Can be either consumer or equipment.

Can be either consumer or equipment.6.2.7 Operation Argument Definition Table  The table below provides an example of the tables used to list anddescribe arguments for interface operations defined in this specification.Table 4 Operation Argument DefinitionsArgument Description Kind FormSee list below See list below 6.2.7.1 Argument  Specifies the name of the argument.6.2.7.2 Kind  Specifies whether the argument is an in, out, or error argument for the operation. errorarguments always function as out arguments, but indicate that the operation did not complete successfully. Allpossible errors that could be returned by an operation are listed in these tables. Unless otherwise indicated, only oneof the listed errors can be returned by an operation in a single invocation.6.2.7.3 Form  Defines the data type of the argument. The terms used to describe data types in this column aredefined in the SEMI Compilation of Terms, or are included as part of the specification. Refer to the compilation ofterms for the definition of SEMI type name meanings. 7 Background7.1 Equipment Data Collection7.1.1 Manufacturing equipment can be comprised of hundreds or thousands of components that interoperate inorder for the equipment to perform its intended function. The volume of information that such equipment canproduce, and the variation among equipment users in the data used for process control and other applications, makesit impractical to send all equipment data off-tool all the time, or to agree on a fixed set of data to make available foreach equipment type. It is therefore important for the equipment to support the ability for consumers to dynamicallydefine the data that is of interest to them (see Figure 2). Wafer HandlingSubsystem Pump Subsystem Mass FlowController others Consumer Equipment Requested Data Figure 2Consumer Specifies What Data Should Be Sent Off-Tool 7.1.2 In addition to declaring interest in specific data that a consumer is interested in, different consumers havedifferent requirements for the acceptable latency with which data should be reported off-tool. For example, aconsumer that is monitoring a trace of several process variables in order to detect an excursion needs to have thisdata available off-tool almost as quickly as the equipment can produce it (see Figure 3). A consumer that ismonitoring low-level sensor/actuator activity for later diagnosis prefers not to have all of this data transmitted as it isproduced, but buffered on the tool and transmitted at periodic intervals (see Figure 4).

An example of this organization is shown in Figure 5.

When the equipment detects that this is occurring, it should be able toprovide a warning to consumers that a performance threshold is being reached. Consumers can respond to thesewarnings by adjusting or disabling the active data collection requests. In the worst case, if the equipment determinesthat continuing to operate under degraded performance conditions may seriously jeopardize its ability to perform itsintended function, the equipment can terminate all data collection activity.7.1.5 This specification describes the concepts and behaviors necessary to facilitate these capabilities on equipment. 8 Overview8.1 Data Collection Concepts8.1.1 This specification allows consumers to describe a set of data in which they are interested, and to ask theequipment to send only that data off-tool, according to a buffering policy specified by the consumer. The types ofdata that are supported by this specification are described in the following sections.8.2 Trace Data8.2.1 Trace data allows data acquisition consumers to request the collection of data values that are continuouslychanging, or that change frequently such as pressure, temperature, RF power, magnetic field strength, or individualactuator state changes, etc. This document defines a mechanism for specifying when trace data collection beginsand ends, what the collection frequency is, and what variables are to be collected in the trace (see Section 11.1.5).8.2.2 This specification defines a mechanism for specifying when to start tracing (see Section 11.1.5.6): On the occurrence of a specific event or exception from a set of possible events and exceptions As soon as enabled8.2.3 This specification defines a mechanism for specifying when to stop tracing (see Section 11.1.5.7): On the occurrence of a specific event or exception from a set of possible events and exceptions After a specified number of collection results have been accumulated As soon as disabled8.2.4 This specification defines a mechanism for identifying parameters to be included in trace data collection (seeSection 11.1.9). Consumers can use any naming convention supported by the equipment, provided that suchconventions can support the concept of a parameter source and a parameter name represented as text fields.8.2.5 This specification defines a mechanism to support on-tool buffering, allowing trace reports containing manycollection results to be sent off-tool at a regular interval (see Sections 11.1.2.3 and 11.1.5.3).8.3 Events8.3.1 Events allow data acquisition consumers to determine when a subsystem, process job, sensor/actuator, orother modeled system undergoes a state transition. Events may have data variables associated with the occurrence

&lt;!-- Page 6 --&gt;

SEMI E134-0305 © SEMI 2004, 20059 of the event. Such variables can include process data such as pressures, temperatures, or voltages, or context datasuch as job related data, recipe IDs, equipment configuration or offset values. Typical consumers need to be able tospecify which variables are to be provided with the event when it is communicated.8.3.2 This specification defines a mechanism for identifying events and parameters to be included in data collection.Consumers can use any naming convention that is supported by the equipment, provided that such convention cansupport the concept of event sources and event ids, and parameter sources and parameter names, each representedas text fields (see Sections 11.1.3 and 14.1.3).8.3.3 This specification defines a mechanism to support on-tool buffering of events, allowing a periodic report ofany events that occurred during a specified interval to be sent off-tool (see Section 11.1.2.3).8.4 Exceptions8.4.1 Exceptions allow data acquisition consumers to know when errors, warnings, or alarms occur on theequipment. These may indicate conditions which affect processing, safety, or the proper operation of the equipment.Exceptions may have data variables associated with the occurrence of the exception. The list of these variables willbe fixed by the equipment implementation.8.4.2 This specification defines a mechanism for identifying exceptions to be included in data collection.Consumers can use any naming convention that is supported by the equipment, provided that such convention cansupport the concept of exception sources and exception ids, each represented as text fields (see Sections 11.1.4 and14.1.4).8.4.3 This specification defines a mechanism to support on-tool buffering of exceptions, allowing a periodic reportof any exceptions that occurred during a specified interval to be sent off-tool (see Section 11.1.2.3).8.5 Data Collection Plans8.5.1 A data collection plan assembles all of the related trace, event, and exception data that may be required for aspecific consumers purpose. For example, a consumer interested in tracking the utilization of the equipment mayonly be interested in specific events that mark actions the equipment takes that indicate how it is being exercised,certain exceptions that may interrupt the equipment, and no trace data. Such a data collection plan might be in effectat all times the equipment is running.8.5.2 A fault detection consumer may be interested in trace, event, and exception data for a specific processing run,and may change the collected data depending on the recipe used. Such data collection plans may only be in effectwhile specific jobs are in process on the equipment. Coordination of data collection plan activation with job activityon the equipment is the consumers responsibility, and is not specified in this document.8.5.3 This document specifies a mechanism for consumers to define one or more data collection plans off-tool andsubmit those definitions to the equipment (see Sections 9.1.2.2 and 11). This document specifies a mechanism fordetermining what plans have been created on the equipment, how they are defined, and whether or not they areactivated (see Sections 9.1.2.3, 9.1.2.4, and 9.1.2.6). A mechanism for activating, deactivating, and deletingindividual plans is also specified (see Sections 9.1.2.5, 9.1.2.7, and 9.1.2.8). The required behavior of datacollection plans is specified in Section 12.8.6 Equipment Operational Performance Monitoring8.6.1 It is possible for consumers to submit data collection requests which, when executing together, significantlytax the equipments computing resources, in addition to any load placed on the equipment by jobs that are inprogress. This document specifies a mechanism for notifying all DCP consumers when such a condition has beendetected, to identify what DCPs and jobs are in progress at the time, and to identify the specific equipmentcomponents that are being adversely affected (see Sections 9.1.2.11, 13, 15.1.5, and 15.1.6).8.7 Ad-hoc Data Requests8.7.1 Ad-hoc data requests are used in cases where the value of some data items is needed at a specific instance intime, and which may not be associated with a specific event or exception. As a simple example, consider anapplication that monitors equipment utilization. Such an application may have an initialization procedure thatincludes determining the current state of each monitored component on the equipment. Without a mechanism forrequesting this information at initialization, the application would instead have to wait for state change events fromeach component before it could determine their state. This may not be acceptable if the application provides a

If &gt; 0, the trace shall continue until a stop trigger (see Section 11.1.5.7) isdetected or until the total number of collection results obtained is equal to collectionCount, whichever occurs first.For example, the consumer may wish to provide both a stop trigger and a non-zero collectionCount in order to limitthe total number of collection results to report regardless of whether or not the stop trigger occurs, or in case an errorcondition on the equipment prevents the stop trigger from firing.11.1.5.3 groupSize11.1.5.3.1 Depending on the buffering capacity of the equipment, the DCP may send a TraceReport beforegroupSize results have been obtained. A TraceReport must not include more than groupSize collection results(excluding groupSize = 0). See Section 12.3.13 for a description of the effect of this setting on DCP behavior.11.1.5.4 isCyclical11.1.5.4.1 At least one start and one stop trigger must be supplied for a trace request to be cyclical. If this attributehas the value true, the trace shall be restarted if any one of the start triggers is detected after termination.

Either the occurrence of a start trigger defined for the trace request wasdetected, or there was no defined start trigger and the DCP began tracing immediately after activation. If the DCPentered this state due to the detection of a start trigger, it shall record the specific trigger that was detected and thetime at which it was detected for inclusion in a trace report (see Section 14.1.5).12.3.6 Waiting forInterval  The DCP is waiting for a time period equal to the TraceRequest attributeintervalInSeconds (see Section 11.1.5) to expire before collecting the data associated with the trace request.12.3.7 TraceRequestBuffering  This is the top level state for trace request buffering activity. Buffered tracerequests store the results of each trace interval as a CollectedData entry within a single TraceReport (see Section14.1.5). Each CollectedData entry appears within the TraceReport in the order the collection results were obtained.12.3.7.1 When a stop trigger is detected, or the total number of results collected since the trace was enabled is equalto collectionCount, or the number of results collected since the last send is equal to groupSize, or the DCPs tracebuffering capacity has been reached, the DCP creates a single DataCollectionReport and makes it available forsending. The DataCollectionReport contains a single TraceReport that contains two or more CollectedData entries,in the order in which the results were obtained (see Section 14.1.5).12.3.8 NotBufferingTraceResults  The trace request is not buffering collected results into a single TraceReport,because groupSize is ≤ 1. Each collected result is added to a new TraceReport and either made available forsending with a DataCollectionReport, or added to the DCP buffer in the order the TraceReport was completed.12.3.9 BufferingTraceResults  The trace request is buffering collected results into a single TraceReport becausegroupSize is &gt; 1.

Each time the performance is evaluated, the equipment shall store in non-volatile memory the job and DCP identifiers that were active at the time the evaluation was initiated (see Section15.1.6.1.1). The equipment shall use this information as the basis for replies to the GetCurrentPerformanceStatusoperation of the DataCollectionManager interface, and for the PerformanceWarning and PerformanceRestorednotifications sent via the DCPConsumer interface (see Section 15.1.5).13.1.3 The equipment shall include the following minimum set of conditions in determining the performanceconditions to monitor: Impairment of the equipments ability to properly control its components for their intended purpose. Impairment of the equipments ability to process/measure/test material at its intended throughput rates. Impairment of the equipments ability to deliver data from active DCPs to consumers.13.1.4 If at any time the equipment determines that continuing to operate under degraded performance conditionswill endanger people, the equipment (including its ability to sustain the transmission of data, or the processing ofdata collection management operations), or the material being processed, measured, or tested, the equipment shallterminate all active DCPs, and notify each client accordingly, using the DCPDeactivation message (see Section15.1.6.2).13.1.5 Note that this specification does not define a mechanism for establishing operational performance thresholds,or any technique for detecting when an equipment systems operational performance is degrading. It is assumed thatequipment performance can be quantified, that it is possible to detect when such performance degrades below somesupplier-defined threshold, and that it is possible to identify which components of the equipment are affected by theissue.13.1.6 Normal  The equipment is operating within supplier-specified performance parameters.13.1.7 BelowThreshold  One or more components of the equipment system is operating below supplier-specifiedperformance parameters.
