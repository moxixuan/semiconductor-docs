SEMI G11-88 © SEMI 1981, 19961 SEMI G11-88RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR RAM FOLLOWER GEL TIME ANDSPIRAL FLOW OF THERMAL SETTING MOLDING COMPOUNDS 1 ScopeThis method describes a procedure for measuring theflow and gel characteristics of semiconductor gradetransfer molding compounds using a ram followerdevice. 2 Applicable Documents 1ASTM D 3123  Plastics, Molding, and Extrusions 3 Significance3.1 The flow of a molding compou nd depends on theinteraction of several variables, and is a measure of thecombined characteristics of speed of gelation and meltviscosity of the particular compound under thespecified conditions. The test is not a valid method forcomparing the moldability of different compoundssince a spiral flow test cannot duplicate actual moldingconditions in different types of molds.3.2 The moldability of thermosetti ng moldingcompounds has generally been defined by a singlespiral flow number. The ram follower device followsgraphically the molding compound as it melts and therate of flow increases, as viscosity builds up due toresin polymerization, and as the flow of the compoundceases. Thus, it measures the gelation point of thecompound, or the point where the material ceases toflow. This information can be an aid in characterizingthe rheological behavior of the molding compound. 4 Apparatus 4.1 Transfer Molding Press  Wi th a platen areasufficient to maintain a uniform mold temperature andhaving (1) a transfer piston pressure potential of 1000psi on the material; (2) sufficient clamping pressure toprevent flashing of the molding compound; and (3) aminimum plunger speed of 25.4 mm (1 inch) persecond without load. The pot diameter shall be 31.75 to44.45 ± 0.635 mm (1.250 to 1.750 ± 0.025 inch) and theclearance between pot and ram shall be sufficientlysmall that flashing does not occur above the firstsealing groove on the ram.4.2 Standard Spiral Flow Mold  Per ASTM D 3123.4.3 Ram Following Apparatus  Consisting of adisplacement transducer attached to the transfer ram of 1 American Society for Testing and Materials, 100 Barr HarborDrive, West Conshohoken, PA 19428-2959 the press in such a way as to accurately record itsmovement, suitable power supply for the displacementtransducer, and a recorder capable of recording thesignal from the displacement transducer and preferablyhaving a chart speed of at least 10 mm per second. Anoptional velocity transducer can also be used as ameans of directly measuring ram velocity and verifyingthe starting and ending of the flow process. In this case,a 2-channel recorder is needed.4.4 Thermocouple and Potentiome ter  Calibrated inthe 149° to 177°C (300° to 350°F) range. (Calibrationto be checked every six months.) 5 Test Conditions5.1 Molding Compound  Refrig erated shipment andstorage of some molding compounds is necessary. Themolding compound is to be at room temperature beforethe container is opened. Once the compound hasequilibrated to room temperature, the test should be runwithin 16 hours. Care must be taken to preserve theoriginal moisture content. The material should be inpowdered form, unless otherwise specified.NOTE: Room temperature defined to be 23° ± 5°C.NOTE: Refer to manufacturers' recommendations regardingshelf life differences which may exist between moldingcompounds. 5.2 The Spiral Flow Mold  Shal l be clean and freefrom any mold release agents or lubricants. A standardmold cleaning compound can be used to insure moldcleanliness.5.3 Molding Conditions5.3.1 The temperature of the mold s hall be measuredusing a thermocouple inserted in the mold. The ramshall be kept at the mold temperature. Moldingtemperature is to be as recommended by the materialspecification unless otherwise specified. Temperaturemust be maintained within ± 3°C (± 5°F) of thespecified temperature.NOTE: Flow duration is strongly influenced by temperature.For critical determinations, the temperature should bemaintained as close to the nominal temperature as practical,preferably within ± 0.5°C (± 1°F). 5.3.2 The weight of the charge shall be adjusted togive a molded cull thickness of 3.302 ± 0.254 mm(0.130 ± 0.010 in.), excluding vertical flash.

&lt;!-- Page 29 --&gt;

SEMI G11-88 © SEMI 1981, 1996 2 5.3.3 The free running ram speed sh all be at least 25.4mm/sec (1"/sec). Recommended speed is 100 ± 25mm/sec into the pot and application of pressure on thecharge shall not exceed 5 seconds.5.3.4 The transfer pressure measured under thetransfer plunger is to be 6.895 ± 0.177 mpa (1000 ± 25psi) unless otherwise specified.5.3.5 Unless otherwise specified, a minimum of 1.5minutes close and cure time shall be used.5.4 Flow Length  Read the spira l flow lengthdirectly from the molded specimen at the point offarthest continuous flow to the nearest 6.35 mm (0.25in).5.5 Flow Duration  The flow du ration or gel time isdefined as the time interval between the moment whenthe ram contacts the charge and the time the ram stopsmoving. The contact and gelation points are determinedfrom the ram follower trace. 6 Procedure for Spiral Flow6.1 Thoroughly clean the ram, pot , and mold of anycured compound, or other foreign matter.6.2 Heat the mold and ram to with in (± 3°C) of thespecified temperature.6.3 At the beginning of each series of tests and at eachchange of compound, check and set the transferpressure using the force gage. The proper force gagesetting can be determined from the formula: F =D2 P4 where F is the force in pounds, P is the desired pressureon the material in psi and D is the ram diameter ininches. 6.4 For each material change, mak e at least threeclean out runs using the material to be tested beforerecording data. These runs may be used to determinethe charge weight.6.5 Weigh out the compound to th e nearest 0.1 g aspreviously determined to yield a cull of 3.302 ± 0.254mm (0.130 ± 0.010 in.).6.6 Raise the ram, add the compou nd to the pot, andimmediately activate the transfer cycle. If the recorderdoes not have a remote on-off that is activated by thecycle start, then it should be started before the cyclestarts. After the ram motion ceases, the chart may bestopped.6.7 Open mold and remove cured material. Measurecull thickness. If the cull is not within 3.302 ± 0.254 mm (0.130 ± 0.010 in.), discard run and repeat the test,adjusting the charge weight as necessary.6.8 Read the flow length to the ne arest 6.35 mm (0.5in.).6.9 Mark the point on the chart wh ere the ram contactsthe charge. This point is identified on the displacementtrace as the point at which the rate of displacementinitially changes.6.10 Mark where the ram stopped moving. Cautionshould be exercised where significant flashing occurs.Count the number of divisions between the two pointsand divide by the chart speed. The result is the flowduration or gel time in seconds. Record this time to thenearest second.6.11 If the optional velocity trace is available, markpoint on the chart where the ram contacts the charge.This point is identified on the velocity trace as the pointat which the transfer velocity transducer initially detectsa significant reduction in velocity output.6.12 Mark where the ram stopped moving. In order todetect the point of zero (0) velocity, the signal must beof sufficient magnitude. Count the number of divisionsbetween the two points and divide by the chart speed.The result is the flow duration or gel time in seconds.Record this time to the nearest second.6.13 If both displacement and veloc ity transducers areused, the starting and ending points should agree,therefore yielding the same gel time.6.14 Repeat step 6.5 at least 3 times for repeatability. 7 Reporting of Results7.1 Report the material designatio n and lot number.7.2 Report the average and standa rd deviation of theflow length and gel time.7.3 Report the temperature and pre ssure used for thetests.

Measure the height of the sample witha micrometer to the nearest 0.0001 inch.5.2 Place the sample into the TMA sample holder andbring the expansion probe down slowly until it justmakes contact with the sample. Place sample on fixtureper Instruction Manual. Add 3.05.0 grams to weighttray. Adjust the Linear Variable DifferentialTransformer (LVDT) to bring the recorder pen on scale.The LVDT is then zeroed with the zero switch.Readjust LVDT, if necessary, to bring pen on scale.5.3 In a nitrogen atmosphere, heat the sample at a rateof 20°C/min. to its post-cure temperature. 5.4 Without changing LVDT or pr obe position, useliquid nitrogen to cool the sample to a temperature atleast 100°C below the deviation from 1.1.5.5 Heat the sample at a rate of 5° C/min. to at least200°C.5.6 Calculate (CTE), using the f ormula: CTE = DL( ) DY( )DT( ) L( )°°° °°° where: L (T+10°)=Length at Temperature 10° higher thantemperature at which CTE is being measured. L(T-10°) =Length at Temperature 10° lower than temperatureat which CTE is being measured Y = Y axis sensitivity in mils./in.T = change in temperature (20°C)L = initial sample height (mils)K = LIT CTEEXP.CTE for aluminum standard 5.7 Run two (2) samples for each lot and record theaverage.5.8 An aluminum standard should be run to determinethe calibration factor K for the Y (length) axis per 5.4above, as necessary to insure the accuracy of theinstrument's calibration.5.9 Temperature readings should b e calibratedperiodically per manual instructions. 6 Report6.1 Data is to include the orientati on for which thesample is measured (e.g., perpendicular to flow).6.2 CTE is reported as a function o f temperature. CTEis to be reported every 10°C increments.6.3 Report molding conditions and post-mold cureconditions.6.4 Report specimen size.NOTE: For many materials, the Glass Transition Temperature(Tg) may be determined by drawing tangents to the curve atthe points of minimum and maximum slope. The point atwhich the tangents intersect is the Tg. The slopes of the linesare referred to as  1 (below Tg) and 2 (above Tg).

Theabove parameters are applicable only so long as the flatsurface area is obtainable using the formula of Figure 4.The radiusing effect of the etching process will roundoff the tips and, therefore, the length of the flat areashould be measured by starting back from the tip 0.254mm (0.010").NOTE: 0.008" flat is desirable. In order to achieve 0.008" flat,on 0.010" thick material, it is necessary to have a designwidth of 0.022" center to center, giving a 0.012" wide leadand 0.010" wide space. 6.2 Horizontal Lead Spacing and Location6.2.1 Spacing between leads to be 0. 152 mm (0.006")minimum after plating.6.2.2 Metal to metal clearance (Dim ension WFigure 7) minimum clearance shall be the greater of0.152 mm (0.006") or the drawing dimension Wminus 0.102 mm (0.004"). In determining dimensionW, the tolerance limits (max. vs. min.) shown on thedrawing shall be used in the calculation.
