SEMI P24-94 © SEMI 1994, 20041 SEMI P24-94 (Reapproved 1104)CD METROLOGY PROCEDURES This standard was technically approved by the Global Micropatterning Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Micropatterning Committee. Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on July 11, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org September2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published in 1994. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this document is to establishuniform procedures for metrology systems for the litho-metrology task. It does not address how these systemswill be applied to solve problems, nor does it addressother contributors to process variations such as thermalwafer processing, exposure tool focus control,materials, etc.1.2 Background  Fundamental to manufacturing isthe gauging or measurement process. It is requiredinitially to develop a usable manufacturing capabilityand then to verify that what is being manufacturedconforms to specification/expectation. 2 Scope2.1 This document discusses determining theperformance of gauging/measurement systems for avery specific application  the lithography section ofintegrated circuit wafer fabrication. This document inmany cases, will be applicable to IC mask-making, inwhich case the word mask can be substituted forwafer.2.2 It is acknowledged that the final measurement for afabricated wafer is the electrical functionality.However, the intermediate lithographic measurementscan be useful in prediction and control of finalfunctionality. This document is intended to be usefulfor this litho-metrology application, irrespective of thetechnology employed.2.3 Measurement results and system performancedepend on the sample(s) used. Therefore, performancefor different systems or the same system at differenttimes can only be appropriately compared when themeasurements are obtained with a sample of the samematerial composition.2.4 The parameter addressed is precision. Additionalimportant parameters are reliability and cleanliness,which have been addressed by other SEMI standards. NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E10  Standard for Definition and Measurementof Equipment Reliability, Availability, andMaintainability (RAM)SEMI P19  Specification for Metrology Pattern Cellsfor Integrated Circuit Manufacture3.2 ASTM Standards1 ASTM D 1129  Standard Terminology Relating toWaterASTM C 609  Standard Test Method forMeasurement of Small Color Differences BetweenCeramic Wall or Floor TileASTM D 4790  Standard Terminology of AromaticHydrocarbons and Related ChemicalsASTM E 180  Standard Practice for Determining thePrecision of ASTM Methods for Analysis and Testingof Industrial and Specialty ChemicalsNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 4 Applications4.1 linewidth measurement  this task is to measurelinewidths as defined by SEMI P19.NOTE 1: Pitch is not addressed in this document.4.2 contact hole measurement  contact and via holearea measurement is a different application which mayuse the same definitions and procedures as line-widthmeasurement. 1 American Society for Testing and Materials, 100 Barr HarborDrive, PO Box C700, West Conshohocken, PA, 19428-2959, Phone:(610) 832-9585, Fax: (610) 832-9555, http://www.astm.org/

SEMI P24-94 © SEMI 1994, 2004 2 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 precision  the degree of agreement of repeatedmeasurements of the same parameter expressedquantitatively as the standard deviation, computed fromthe results of a series of controlled determinations\[ASTM D 1129, D-29\].5.1.2 A frequency plot of measurements taken withrandom error illustrates precision. The spread orvariation of measurement in test A is smaller than thatin test B. The results of test A are more precise than theresults from test B. See Figure 1.NOTE 2: Any test procedure used needs to differentiatebetween system and wafer contribution. Frequency MeasurementSA SB Figure 1Generic Frequency Plot 5.1.3 repeatability  the standard deviation of resultsobtained by the same operator using the sameinstrument in successive measurements \[ASTM C 609,C-21\]. The same system parameters need to be used.The degree to which the individual operator affects themeasured result is a critical parameter and must beidentified and benchmarked.NOTE 3: The degree to which the individual operator affectsthe measured result may be a critical parameter and must beidentified.5.1.4 reproducibility  the precision of a test methodexpressed in terms of agreement expected betweenmeasurements made in different laboratories usingsimilar apparatus and the same procedure \[ASTM D4790, D-16\].5.1.5 stability  the standard deviation of means ofgroups of measurements taken at specified intervalsover an extended period of time.NOTE 4: The means are used to avoid including themeasurement precision. Stability is a characterization of thesystem independent of precision. It is important to use a stable sample so that system stability, independent of the sample, isdetermined.5.1.6 standard deviation  a measure of the dispersionof a series of results around their average, expressed asthe square root of the quantity, obtained by adding thesquares of the deviations from the average of the resultsand dividing by the number of observations minus one.It is also the square root of the variance and can becalculated as follows: s = x i  x( )2 n  1 1( ) Where:s = estimated standard deviation of the series of resultsX i = each individual valueX = average (arithmetic mean) of all values, andn = number of valuesThe following forms of this equation are moreconvenient for computation, especially when using acalculator: s =x2  x( )2/ n n  1 2( ) or s =n x2  x( )2 n n  1( ) 3( ) where:s = estimated standard deviationx2 = sum of the squares of all the individual valuesx( )2 = square of the total of the individual values,andn = number of valuesNOTE 5: Care must be taken in using either of theseequations that a sufficient number of decimal places is carriedin the sum of the values and in the sum of their square so thatserious rounding errors do not occur. For best results, allrounding should be postponed until after a value has beenobtained for s \[ASTM E 180, E 15\].

SEMI P24-94 © SEMI 1994, 20043 6 Procedures to Benchmark Precision6.1 Precision Types6.1.1 Static Precision  A series of measurementsmade of a single feature where, for each measurement,the information is reacquired and reprocessed. Theminimal intervention required to repeat themeasurement will be used. The standard deviation willbe calculated based on the sample data.6.1.2 Z (Axis Adjustment) Precision  A series ofmeasurements is made of a single feature where it isnecessary to refocus before each measurement (withoutintentional movement in the x and y axes before eachmeasurement). The standard deviation will becalculated based on the sample data.6.1.2.1 Dynamic Precision  Make one measurementof grouped line and space features at n number of siteson a focus/exposure matrix wafer, which includestypical size and side wall angle variations. Remove thewafer from the system, then reload and remeasure.Compute the dynamic precision, 3s, by the doublesample method (see Section 8.1.3).6.1.2.1.1 A total of 1 size  n sites  2 repeates = 2nmeasure-ments per wafer  3 passes = 6nmeasurements required.6.1.2.1.2 10 is a minimum recommended value for n.6.1.2.1.3 This may also be redone for differentthicknesses of lines to be measured and repeated foreach of the wafer types in the process. 7 Precision Test7.1 Test Methods7.1.1 Stability Test Method  Makes a group of fivemeasurements of a stable feature, such as etchedpolysilicon, at the same position, daily. Any systemadjustment, maintenance, environment variation isallowed, but noted. Recalibration is optional, but isnoted. Use a feature which doesnt change over time,or with repeated measurements. Plot the daily averageson an individual control chart with control limits basedon the moving range of the daily averages.7.1.2 Sequence Test Method  A series or sequence ofmeasurements is taken of the same physical location.Any change between measurements determines the typeof precision tested.7.1.3 Double Sample Test Method  Twomeasurements are taken at separate times within the testrun at a number of different physical locations. Aseries of sites is used which have: same nominal size, same proximity of other features, similar side wallangle, etc.7.2 Test Duration7.2.1 Short Term  No system calibration, adjustment,or maintenance will be done. The period should beshort enough to minimize the effect of environmentalvariations. See R1-1.7.2.2 Long Term  Any system adjustments,maintenance, environment variation is allowed. SeeR1-2. Recalibration is optional.7.2.3 Presentation of Results  Some information,relative to the data, must be included to qualify theresults. Graphical representation of the data isrecommended.7.2.3.1 The following must be included: The estimated (1, 2, or 3) standard deviation(s), Short or Long Term Confidence interval (see Application Note A.3) The number of measurements or sample size (n) Describe the feature film and substrate film Nominal or average measurement Feature Type: line or space or hole, grouped orisolated The frequency of recalibration Test identified as the type performed7.2.3.1.1 Additional information which should also beincluded, particularly with unusual conditions, are: Metric units are recommended, such as nanometer\[nm\] or micrometer \[m\] Feature characteristics, such as: sidewall angle,wall profile, corner radius, materials, thickness,index of refraction, edge waviness, edge roughness Duration of the test The sample frequency Significant parameters such as operator, systemmodel, serial number, pertinent environmentalconditions, etc.

SEMI P25-94 © SEMI 1994, 20041 SEMI P25-94 (Reapproved 1104)SPECIFICATION FOR MEASURING DEPTH OF FOCUS AND BESTFOCUS This specification was technically approved by the Global Micropatterning Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Microlithography Committee. Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.orgSeptember 2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published in 1994. 1 Purpose1.1 This document provides a common descriptivevocabulary and outline of basic technique for use byphotolithographers in the IC industry to gauge andreport the depth of focus, astigmatism, and fieldcurvature of IC photolithographic instruments (e.g.,scanners, steppers). \[Hereafter referred to asinstrument or instruments.\] 2 Scope2.1 This specification is limited to the measurement offocus and depth of focus for photolithography as usedin the manufacture of integrated circuits and closelyallied technologies. Because of the wide variation inequipment techniques, it is not possible to provide adefinitive measurement procedure for these parameters.Rather, in this document, a basic guideline is offered.NOTE 1: This technique has value in determining the bestfocus setting for a given application, however the mainconcern will be the determination for the depth of focus,astigmatism and field curvature for the purpose of comparingdifferent instruments and processes.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 It must be emphasized that the values of depth offocus, astigmatism, and field curvature cannot bedetermined for a given instrument independent of theeffects of the image geometries and the image transferprocess. The values will have to be determined underthe constraints of a practical application process,suitable for the instrument, illumination, process, objectpattern, and environment. Thus, the process to be usedfor a fair measure of instrument performance must beone that is appropriate and has been optimized for thegiven instrument and application. Comparison of theperformance of two different instruments willinherently be a comparison of the the total application,instrument specific processes included. A description of the process is a necessary part of the report of a depthof focus, astigmatism or field curvature measurement.Relying on values that were obtained undersignificantly different application conditions from thedesired application will result in error and potentialunexpected process failure. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI P19  Metrology Pattern Cells for IntegratedCircuit ManufactureNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 DefinitionsNOTE 2: The scope of the following definitions does notnecessarily cover application outside of the proceduresdiscussed herein. For more universal definitions anddiscussion, the user is referred to any of the standard opticaltexts.5.1.1 image (micropatterning)  any single geometricform appearing in a layout: (1) drafting  as a part of amaster drawing or layout; (2) optical  as projected ona screen or viewed, usually at some magnification orreduction; (3) oxide  as etched in the silicon dioxidelayer on an oxidized silicon wafer; (4) photographic as in a photomask or in the emulsion of a photographicfilm or plate; (5) as a photoresist, an exposed anddeveloped coating on a substrate.5.1.2 processed image (micropatterning)  any singlegeometric form appearing in the realized pattern ortopographical variation in a material surface or materialconstitution, obtained by a physical process of patterntransference from an optical image.NOTE 3: This definition is intended to extend the discussionof depth of focus and focus to include both cases where theimages are realized in photoresist films, per the imagedefinition given above, and cases where there may not in factbe a photoresist film involved in the optical patterntransference process. Examples include photoactive chemicalvapor deposition and photo ablation.

SEMI P25-94 © SEMI 1994, 2004 2 5.1.3 standard coordinates  a system of Cartesiancoordinates with the z axis along the optical axis of thesystem and with the x and y axes in the flat planeperpendicular to the optical axis. The system user or thesupplier will specify the x and y directions in this planefor any particular equipment studies.NOTE 4: Upon occasion, cylindrical coordinates may beused for special discussions, for example, mappingastigmatism. The standard transform is used between theCartesian (x,y) and the cylindrical (r,) is used.NOTE 5: The x and y coordinates are taken as displacementsfrom the optical axis along a flat plane. Thus, if the imageplane is curved, the x and y coordinates are taken from theprojection of the curved image plane onto a flat plane.Consistently, r is taken as the distance along a perpendicularto the optical axis.NOTE 6: A displacement along the z axis (and hence theoptical axis) from a reference position will be negative fordisplacements toward midpoint of the optical system andpositive for displacements away from the midpoint of theoptical system, regardless of whether the reference position ison the object side or on the image side or coincident withsome portion of the optical system.NOTE 7: For folded optical systems, the coordinate system isallowed to rotate with position along the optical axis so thatthe above definition holds at any given position along theaxis. Alternately, it may be assumed that for purposes of usingthis coordinate system, all optical paths are represented asunfolded.5.1.4 image field  the extent of the image along the xand y axes. It may be defined by the limits of imagequality, as a practical matter, for the intendedapplication.NOTE 8: Definitions 5.1.1 and 5.1..2 in combination with5.1.4 define the drafting image field, the optical image field,the processed image field, etc. The term image refers to asingle geometrical form. The term field refers to thecomplete set of forms.5.1.5 practical use  the conditions of photoprocess,image geometries, etc. that are required for the intendeduse of the instrument. The practical use is specified bythe following: process  photoresist type and chemicalprocessing, exposure conditions, andenvironmental conditions (temperature andhumidty setpoints and stability). pattern  description or diagram of the teststructures, including the choice geometricaldimensions, orientations, positions. substrate  the substrate quality andspecifications, including all pre-existing structuresand layers on the substrate.  leveling  the leveling mechanism used to holdthe substrate at the desired position and angle withrespect to the optical image plane. site  list or map of the image sites in theprocessed image field used for the tests. criteria  the acceptance criteria used in theevaluation of the processed images.NOTE 9: Typically, the instrument vendor will indicate arange of practical use parameters and the instrument user willselect from this range the actual conditions, as is appropriateto the users needs.5.1.6 resolution, practical  the minimum line widththat reproduces the mask (or drafting) dimensionsfaithfully. \[SEMI Micropatterning  Terms andDefinitions Relating to the Microlithography Industry\]NOTE 10: The practical resolution is a number specified bythe equipment vendor.5.1.7 point-like object  A circular or square form inthe image where the diameter or width is equal to thepractical resolution.5.1.8 evaluative line pattern  A pattern in the imageconstructed of 3 to 5 straight parallel lines where thelines are oriented at some specified angle with respectto the standard coordinates and where the width of thelines is equal to the practical resolution and the pitch ofthe lines is twice the practical resolution. (See SEMIP19.)5.1.9 saggital lines  An evaluative line pattern wherethe lines lie along a radius to the optical axis. (SeeFigure 1.)NOTE 11: Saggital lines are primarily formed from light raysthat do not lie in planes containing the optical axis. For opticalsystems having cylindrical symmetry, such as some reductionsteppers, the saggital lines will be radial lines from someparticular point of the image field. For other systems the linesmay not be radial. For example, the saggital direction forscanners is perpendicular to the direction of the scanthroughout the image field.5.1.10 tangential lines  An evaluative line patternwhere the lines lie perpendicular to a radius to theoptical axis. (See Figure 1.)NOTE 12: Tangential lines are primarily formed from lightrays that do lie in planes containing the optical axis. Forsystems having cylindrical symmetry, tangential lines lie uponcircles about some particular point of the image field. Forother systems, the lines may not be so arranged. For example,the tangential direction for scanners is parallel to the directionof the scan throughout the image field.5.1.11 focus  a condition of geometric adjustment ofthe lenss object, the optical system and the image planesuch that the optical image rays originating from agiven point in the object converge to the smallest

It is always given as a numerical displacementof the optical image point along the optical axis fromsome arbitrary reference such as an optical exit surface,optical center, conjugate plane, etc. Focus may varyacross the image field and is properly given as a z axisvalue for a specified image site in the image field. (Seethe definition for Focal Surface.)NOTE 13: Point-like objects will have the sharpest opticalimage at this z-axis position. The z-axis position for thesharpest processed image of point-like objects will usuallyhave a constant offset from the z-axis position for the sharpestoptical image for point-like objects. (See mean focus andbest focus definitions that follow in the text.)NOTE 14: This is also the position which yields the highestcontrast in the photon flux at the given point in the opticalimage.5.1.12 line focus  the z axis position where forevaluative lines in the image, the optical image has thehighest contrast and the evaluative line pattern willconsequently appear with the correct width and pitch.Line focus may vary across the image field and isproperly given as a z axis value for a specified imagesite in the image field. It also varies with the line angle,and the line focus must, therefore, include aspecification of the angle (e.g., saggital, tangential, orsome other angle).5.1.13 focal surface  the surface determined byfinding the focus for each point-like object in theoptical image field, with the object fixed with respect tothe lens. The focal surface is then the map of z axisdisplacements for the highest contrast at each point inthe optical image field as a function of the (x,y) or (r, )coordinates.NOTE 15: It is important to remember that the unqualifiedfocal surface is determined using point-like objects, not linesor gratings. Separate determinations must be made for non-point-like objects.5.1.14 field flatness  the difference between themaximum and the minimum z axis positions over thefocal surface.5.1.15 saggital focal surface  the focal surfacedetermined by examining only saggital lines.5.1.16 tangential focal surface  the focal surfacedetermined by examining only the tangential lines.5.1.17 normal astigmatism  the difference in z axisposition at each image site between the saggital focalsurface and the tangential focal surface. Astigmatism isa map of scalar values over the (x,y) coordinates of theimage field.5.1.18 rotated astigmatism  at each image site, the zaxis difference for the line focus of two evaluative line sets, oriented at right angles to each other and at somespecified angle to the coordinate system, where thespecified angle is selected so that the z axis focusdifference is a maximum at the given image site. Thespecified angle may vary from image site to image site.NOTE 16: This is called rotated astigmatism because thespecified angle is not necessarily the saggital or tangentialdirection.5.1.19 mean focus  the z axis position representingthe area average focal surface for point-like objects inthe optical image.5.1.20 best focus  a position of the processed imagesurface such that the best compromise of focus acrossthe whole of the processed image is obtained, asdefined by the application requirements upon theprocessed image. The best focus is a single numericalvalue for the processed image surface displacement.The best compromise may be such as to optimize thepossible defocus range or may optimize the line widthvariations or may minimize the deviation from sometarget width or may relate to some other processedimage parameter.NOTE 17: Because of processing effects, this may or maynot correspond to an optical conjugate plane coincident withthe photoresist film or other processed layer  top, middle, orbottom.NOTE 18: Because the processed image surface willgenerally have a curvature that is not adjustable, it is not usualfor the processed image surface to fully correspond to any ofthe focal surfaces. Focal surfaces are defined by determiningthe z-axis position for a given focus condition, as a functionof the image position. A processed image surface is thereforeset at a z axis position that provides the best compliance to thefocal surface.5.1.21 defocus  the distance, perpendicular to theimage plane, between the processed image plane andthe plane of best focus.NOTE 19: A defocus of zero is the best focus position, apositive defocus places the optical image plane further fromthe lens, a negative defocus places the optical image planecloser to the lens.5.1.22 focal range  depth of focus  the totaldistance of defocus where over the whole of theprocessed image field, the processed image issufficiently resolved for practical use.5.1.23 depth of focus map  a plot, for each positionin the image field, of the greatest defocus in the positivedirection and the greatest defocus in the negativedirection, where the processed image is sufficientlyresolved for practical use.NOTE 20: As stated previously, the focal range or the depthof focus are dependent on the process, upon the imagegeometries (especially the line width), and upon the

&lt;!-- Page 18 --&gt;

SEMI P25-94 © SEMI 1994, 2004 4 permissible deviations. The depth of focus maps may bedependant, among other things, on the process, line width,and image geometry, especially the choice of point-likepatterns or line-like patterns along the saggital, tangential, orother directions. Several maps may be produced as part of atest, covering these variations. 6 Procedure6.1 Pattern  See SEMI P19. A pattern and patterndimensions are to be selected in accordance with themost reasonable correspondence to the intendedapplication of the equipment. Typically, the pattern willconsist of two sets of evaluative lines. A sequence ofpatterns of varying line widths may also be employed,in which case the depth of focus may be reported as afunction of the line width. The pattern selection anddimensions must be included as part of the report.6.2 Test Sites  The pattern is to be repeated at leastnine times over the image field. The minimum of ninesites will include the four corners of the image, the fouredge midpoints of the image field and the center of theimage field. Whichever many sites are used, the sitesmust be distributed symmetrical and uniformly over theimage field, giving no special weight to any portion ofthe image field. For examples, see Figure 2.6.3 Process  A test image will be printed under thesame conditions and processes to be used in thepractical application (see Section 2) of the instrument(stepper, scanner, etc.). The process description will beincluded in the depth of focus and best focus report.6.4 Focus Steps  The image will be printed severaltimes, varying the defocus by a fixed amount betweeneach print. The amount of variation of defocus betweensteps and the limits of the defocus will be selected so asto bracket the expected best focus position and to reachbeyond the depth of focus at the extremes of the imageseries, as best as can be determined. The number andsize of the defocus steps must be specified in the report.6.5 Image Array  These multiple images can be arow of separate exposure fields on one substrate,multiple stepped displaced exposures of the testgeometry within one image field region, or evenexposures on entirely separate substrates. The particularstrategy is usually constrained by the functions of theinstrument under test.6.6 Test Measurements  For each image site for bothtest pattern orientations and at each value of defocus,the processed image geometries will be examined andeither accepted or rejected on the basis of imagesharpness, image size or some related imagecharacteristic. Usually this examination will use the linewidth as the acceptance criteria. The total number of the measurements will be twice the number of sites timesthe number of defocus steps.6.7 Quantitative Image Evaluation  The photoresistimage patterns will be examined or measured fordeviation from the target, in a manner specified by thevendor or user of the instrument. An acceptable imageis where the variation of the pattern is not outside thepermissible deviation under the conditions of theintended use of the equipment. The defocus values forwhich the image is usable will be determined at eachimage site within the image field.6.8 Depth of Focus and Best Focus Determination The defocus variation over which there are usableimages at simultaneously every test site within the field,by the above criteria, will be reported as the practicalfocal range. In accordance with the definition, the bestfocus will be the z axis position where some targetspecification is met or the possible defocus ismaximized or the line deviation minimized, etc. If thereis no common range of usable defocus across the field,the depth of focus is zero and the best focus isundetermined. This can occur due to, among otherthings, a large plane tilt of substrate to the optical axis,high aerial image focus surface curvature, highastigmatism, and auto focus system instabilities.6.9 Focal Astigmatism Determination  The testmeasurements are separated into two groups, one groupfor each of the two different orthogonal orientations ofthe test pattern. These groups are referred to as the Sand T groups, however the saggital and tangentialorientations have not necessarily been used inaccordance with the definition of rotated astigmatism.6.9.1 For each group separately, the focal surface isdetermined by using for each site the midpoint of thedefocus values where the processed image is found tobe acceptable, in accordance with Section 6.7.6.9.2 The difference in z position between thesesurfaces for each image site is calculated. Thesedifferences are plotted as a function of image position.This map of values is the astigmatism.6.9.3 The maximum of the absolute values is themaximum astigmatism.6.9.4 The average of the absolute values is the meanastigmatism.6.10 Field Flatness Determination  Two alternativebut essentially equivalent methods of determining thefocal surface are allowed:a. The focal surface which is the midpoint of the S andT focal surfaces is calculated.

Alternatively, if point-like objects are available inthe image for evaluation, the focal surface may beobtained by finding the z displacement for the bestprocessed point image at each image site. 6.10.1 This focal surface is reported as a map of zdisplacements as a function of image position. Thismap is the curvature of field.6.10.2 The difference between the minimum zdisplacement in the focal surface and the maximum zdisplacement in the focal surface is the maximumcurvature of field.NOTE 21: This includes optical image curvature, wafercurvature, fixture curvature, etc. This procedure for the sakeof simplicity does not separate these effects. It is an error toconsider this measure of field flatness equivalent to a measureof the optical image focal surface. 7 Report7.1 The depth of focus, best focus, etc. reports willinclude a description of the practical use, per definition5.1.5. In addition, the report should include mention ofany special mechanical considerations  in particular,among others, mention should be made if a chipleveling scheme is used and whether this scheme is siteby site or global.7.2 List of report contents: Process: substrate and layer types and processing,exposure conditions Pattern: description or diagram of the teststructures, including the choice of S and T or X andY orientations Wafer: the wafer quality and specifications.

SEMI P28-96 © SEMI 19961 SEMI P28-96SPECIFICATION FOR OVERLAY-METROLOGY TEST PATTERNS FORINTEGRATED-CIRCUIT MANUFACTURE 1 Purpose1.1 This document defines several standard overlay-metrology patterns that are used by metrologyequipment users to evaluate and test micropatterningequipment and processes in integrated circuit (IC)manufacturing. These overlay cells may be placed byoptional patterning methods onto substrates during themanufacturing process. Usage of the standard overlaypatterns is an attempt to provide consistentindustrywide use of automated metrology equipment. 2 Scope2.1 This specification defines general designs thatdescribe the shape, size, design rules, and placementconsiderations (where appropriate) of several basicpatterns for overlay metrology. These standard testpatterns can be used for optical, scanning electronbeam, and other types of metrology. 3 Limitations3.1 The patterns described in this document representthe first pass at an industrywide commonality for thepurpose of compatibility among various types ofautomated metrology equipment. It is not suggested,however, that these test patterns are a full complementor are optimal for all overlay-metrology applications.This document does not attempt to specify how thepatterns are to be imaged or measured on the substrate. 4 Referenced Documents4.1 SEMI DocumentsSEMI International Standards Handbook  Section E:Compilation of TermsSEMI P6  Specification for Registration Marks forPhotomasksSEMI P18  Specification for Overlay Capabilities ofWafer SteppersSEMI P19  Specification for Metrology Pattern Cellsfor Integrated Circuit Manufacture 4.2 ASTM Standard1F 127-84  Definition of Terms Relating toPhotomasking Technology for Microelectronics 1 American Society for Testing and Materials, 100 Barr HarborDrive, West Conshohoken, PA 19428-2959 5 Terminology5.1 centerline  a reference line t hat is equidistantfrom opposite edges of a feature.5.2 feature  areas within a singl e continuousboundary (for example, an aggregate image) that haveany physical property that is distinct from thebackground area outside the feature (e.g., the simplestelement of a test pattern, such as a single line or bar).Some physical properties that may distinguish thefeature are the refractive index, surface roughness, etc.5.3 feature dimension  the dime nsion of interest;such as, the side of a box , bar width, and/or length.5.4 overlay (micropatterning)A vector quantity defined at every point on the wafer.It is the difference, O , between the vector position, 1P ,of a substrate geometry, and the vector position of thecorresponding point, 2P , in an overlaying pattern,which may consist of photoresist. \[SEMI P18-92\]NOTE: All overlay test patterns are designed to provideboth X and Y components of the vector overlay. 5.5 pattern, overlay test  a grou p of features foroverlay metrology.5.6 pitch  the distance between a point on an imageand the corresponding point on the correspondingimage in an adjacent functional pattern.5.7 substrate (materials)  in sem iconductortechnology, a wafer that is the basis for subsequentprocessing operations in the fabrication ofsemiconductor devices or circuits. \[ASTM F 1241-89\]NOTE: The meaning of substrate is not limited towafers. 6 General Specification6.1 Introduction6.1.1 This specification describes th e overlay testpatterns that are illustrated in the figures at the end ofthis document. The imaging means by which these testpatterns are defined on the substrate may be selected bythe user (see 6.2.1).6.1.2 Characteristics of the overlay p atterns, such asmaterials, topography, polarity, and method of patterntransfer will be defined by the user unless otherwisenoted. When reporting measurements extracted fromthese overlay test patterns, the user should state the

&lt;!-- Page 26 --&gt;

SEMI P28-96 © SEMI 1996 2 physical conditions (e.g., photoresist island on metalover an oxide window). The user should further statewhich features constitute the substrate geometry andwhich constitute the overlaying pattern (terms as usedin the definition of overlay in 5.4). In general, thevectors P1 and P2 terminate at the geometrical centersof the substrate pattern and the overlaying patternrespectively.6.2 Applications6.2.1 The overlay test patterns are in tended to be usedin a variety of applications. The following applicationslist shows some uses for the overlay test patterns. Primary Pattern Generation Lithography & Metrology EquipmentCharacterization In-Line Process Overlay Monitoring Manufacturing Characterization Process Transfer Between Manufacturing Sites6.3 Guidelines6.3.1 The overlay test patterns descr ibed hereinrepresent a basic metrology set from which compositepatterns may be constructed.6.3.2 Each overlay test pattern has a fundamentaldesign. The user may adjust the dimensionsappropriately as they apply to the users specificprocessing/equipment situations.6.3.3 It is required that labels, borde r lines, indicatormarks, or any other adjacent features be avoided, or atleast separated by a minimum of ten (10) micrometersfrom the overlay cell. This proximity guideline isdefined to remind the user that patterns intended to beindependent and symmetric be designed ascircumstances permit. The user should determine actualspacing values, because spacing may be level-, process-, and/or tool-dependent.6.3.4 It is recognized that there are d esign limitationsdictated by the equipment and processes used togenerate the pattern (e.g., computer aided graphics(CAD) grids, pattern generation (PG) rectangles, E-beam spot sizes). The user may modify the overlay testpatterns in order to meet equipment limitations (e.g.,stay on grid) provided that the resulting patterns or theirrepresentations retain the designed structures andsymmetry. 7 Detailed Specification7.1 Introduction 7.1.1 The figures provided within th is document areintended to illustrate sample layouts of several overlaytest patterns, and to define appropriate design elementsused within each. The overlay test pattern dimensionsare provided when appropriate. It is understood that, tooptimize the test patterns performance in a specificapplication, the user may deviate beyond this standard.7.2 Specific Overlay Patterns  A ll patterns have 90°rotational symmetry.7.2.1 Box-in-Box (see Figure 1)7.2.1.1 The box-in-box test pattern is designed to be atest pattern for overlay measurement on metrologyequipment. This is the simplest possible designpresented.7.2.1.2 The box-in-box test pattern co nsists of twosquare features. Each box is normally defined by adifferent imaging step; that is, one box corresponds tothe substrate geometry and the other box corresponds tothe overlaying pattern (5.4). The two boxes aredesigned to be concentric.7.2.1.3 The design elements are the fe ature dimensionsof the outer box, B o, and of the inner box, B i. Thedimensions should follow these guidelines:outer box: B o = 12  30 micrometers (m)inner box: B i = B o/2These specifications define a range of box sizes andtheir interfeature spacing. Users should modify the box-in-box dimensions as dictated by design rules, process,and/or measurement equipment requirements. The usershould recognize that edges in close proximity maycause measurement errors. 7.2.2 Frame-in-Frame (see Figure 2 )7.2.2.1 The frame-in-frame test patter n is designed tobe a test pattern for overlay measurement on metrologyequipment. It has two designed edges per axis on eachside of each imaged step. The additional informationgained by having two features on each level, each witha centerline, may reduce the measurement uncertaintyas compared to the box-in-box design.7.2.2.2 The design elements are the pi tch of oppositemembers of the outer frame (Fo), the pitch of oppositemembers of the inner frame (Fi), and the widths of theframes (W o and/or W i) as shown in Figure 2. Eachframe is normally defined by a different imaging step;that is, one frame corresponds to the substrate geometryand the other box corresponds to the overlaying pattern(see 5.4). The frames are designed to be concentric.7.2.2.3 The design elements are the ou termostdimension of the outer frame (Fo), the outermost

&lt;!-- Page 27 --&gt;

SEMI P28-96 © SEMI 19963 dimension for the inner frame (Fi), and the width(s) ofthe frames (W o and/or W i). The dimensions shouldfollow these guidelines:outer frame: Fo = 1530 micrometers (m)inner frame: Fi = Fo/2width: W = 1.01.5 m for Fo ≤ 24 m, or 1.52.0m for Fo ≥ 24 mNOTE: The width of the inner and outer bars may differ.These specifications define a range of frame sizes andtheir interfeature spacing. Users may modify the frame-in-frame dimensions as dictated by design rules,process, and/or measurement equipment requirements. 7.2.3 Bars-in-Bars (see Figure 3)7.2.3.1 The bars-in-bars test pattern is designed to be atest pattern for overlay measurement on metrologyequipment. Each axis has two designed edges per axison each side of each imaging step. The additionalinformation gained by having two features on eachlevel, each with a centerline, may reduce themeasurement uncertainty as compared to the box-in-box design.7.2.3.2 The overlay test pattern consis ts of two sets ofbars, the outer set and the inner set. Each set of bars isarranged to form an overlay measurement frame asshown in Figure 3. Each bar-in-bar set is normallydefined by a different imaging step; that is, the set ofinner bars corresponds to the substrate geometry andthe set of outer bars corresponds to the overlayingpattern (5.4), or vice versa. The two sets of bars aredesigned to be concentric.7.2.3.3 The design elements are the pi tch for the outerset of bars (B o), the pitch for the inner set of bars (B i),the length of the outer bars (Lo), the length of the innerbars (Li), and the width(s) of the bars (W o and/or W i).The overlay test pattern dimensions should follow theseguidelines:outer bar set: Bo = 1530 minner bar set: B i = B o/2outer bar length: Lo = 50%70% B oinner bar length: LI = 50%70% B iwidth: W = 1.01.5 m for B o ≤ 24 m, or 1.52.0m for B o ≥ 24 mNOTE: The width of the inner and outer bars may differ.These specifications define a range of box sizes andtheir interfeature spacing. Users may modify the box-in-box dimensions as dictated by design rules, process, and/or measurement equipment requirements. The usershould recognize that edges in close proximity maycause measurement errors. 7.3 User Considerations for Overl ay-MetrologyEquipment7.3.1 Pattern Acquisition  To ensure automaticacquisition of the desired overlay test pattern by animage-based automated overlay metrology equipment,one or more of the following may be required:1. Separation of each overlay test pattern as requiredper metrology equipment specification.2. Use of only one overlay test pattern in themeasurement field-of-view.3. Printing unique labels next to each overlay testpattern using the proximity guideline in Section6.3.3. 7.3.2 Feature Dimensions  For ea ch overlay testpattern, only a range of feature dimensions is defined(e.g., paragraph 7.2.2.3). The user and supplier togethershould determine that the dimensions of the overlay testpatterns they select are those that consider design rules,the users process capability, and limitations of themicrolithography and measurement equipment.7.3.2.1 Width Dimensions (frame-in-f rame or bars-in-bars test patterns)  When all features of the overlaytest pattern are imaged at the same process step, thewidths of the inner and outer features are recommendedto be equal, and of the same polarity, in order tominimize overlay-measurement errors.

This guideline useshalftone phase shift masks as the nomenclature.2.3 Items not described in this gui deline shall conformto SEMI P1. 3 Referenced DocumentsNOTE: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 3.1 SEMI DocumentsSEMI P1  Specification for Hard Surface PhotomaskSubstratesSEMI P22  Guideline for Photomask DefectClassification and Size Definition 4 Terminology4.1 Terms for General Description4.1.1 halftone phase shift mask  a photomaskdesigned to increase resolution through intentionalcontrol of light transmittance and phase against atransparent part by replacing a conventional opaquepattern with a thin, partially transmitting film (halftoneshifter film) that controls light phase difference andtransmittance.4.1.2 phase shift mask  a photoma sk designed toincrease resolution through intentional control of theexposure light phase. 4.2 Terms for Structural Descripti on4.2.1 additional film type opaque rin g  an opaquering composed of light shield materials other than theshifter.4.2.2 embedded shifter type opaque ring  an opaquering composed of small rectangles or line/space patternsin a shifter.4.2.3 multilayer halftone phase shift mask  ahalftone phase shift mask having multiple thin films ofdifferent material compositions to give a certain phasedifference and transmittance. The layer that adjoins thesubstrate should be called the first layer.4.2.4 opaque ring  an area of a ce rtain width,adjacent to the periphery of the desired exposure areaon a reticle, located in the non-exposure area of thereticle to obtain a dark portion required in a waferlithography process.4.2.5 single-layer halftone phase shi ft mask halftone phase shift mask having a thin film of uniformmaterial composition to give a certain phase differenceand transmittance.4.3 Terms for Description of Optic al Characteristics4.3.1 glass side reflectivity  a ratio of intensity ofreflected light to intensity of incident light into the glassside that is the backside of the shifter film. Theintensity of incident light is usually calculated by theintensity of reflected light measured using a referencemirror. (Figure 1 illustrates the glass side reflectivity.) Figure 1Glass Side Reflectivity

SEMI P29-0997 © SEMI 1997 2 4.3.2 opaque ring transmittance  a ratio of intensityof light transmitted through the additional film typeopaque ring area to intensity of incident light measuredwith air reference. (Figure 2 illustrates the opaque ringtransmittance.)NOTE 1: For a halftone phase shift mask with embeddedshifter type opaque ring, transmittance of the opaque ring areais not defined in this guideline because it depends heavily onthe characteristics of the optical systems used. Figure 2Opaque Ring Transmittance4.3.3 opening area transmittance  a ratio ofintensity of light transmitted through an opening area ofa patterned halftone phase shift mask to intensity ofvertical incident light measured with air reference.(Figure 3 illustrates the opening area transmittance.) Figure 3Opening Area Transmittance4.3.4 phase difference  a differenc e in phase of lightgenerated by vertical transmission through a shifter areaand an opening area with air equivalent to the shifterfilm in thickness.4.3.5 relative transmittance  a rat io of intensity oflight transmitted through a shifter area to intensity oflight transmitted through an opening area. (Figure 4illustrates the relative transmittance.) Figure 4Relative Transmittance4.3.6 shifter side reflectivity  a rat io of intensity ofreflected light to intensity of incident light onto thesurface of a shifter film. The reflected light is the sumof the reflected light from the shifter surface andreflected light from the boundary between shifter andglass, and the boundary between glass and air. Thereflectivity depends on the incident angle, thewavelength of the light, and the extent of polarizationof the incident light. The intensity of incident light isusually calculated by the intensity of reflected lightmeasured using reference mirror. (Figure 5 illustratesthe shifter side reflectivity.) Figure 5Shifter Side Reflectivity4.3.7 shifter area transmittance  r atio of intensity oflight transmitted through a shifter area of a halftonephase shift mask (blank) to intensity of vertical incidentlight measured with air reference.
