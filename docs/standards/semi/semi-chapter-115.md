The normality (meq/mL) is thencalculated by the titrator using the data obtained. 2 Apparatus2.1 Autotitrator2.2 Glass combination electrode2.3 Class A grade volumetric pipe ts in 1 to 25 mLsizes2.4 250 mL beakers 3 Reagents3.1 1.0 N Hydrochloric acid (from concentrate orready to use 1.0 N)3.2 Primary Standard  High-pu rity sodiumcarbonate is available from most chemical supplyhouses, but must be dried at 400 degree centigradebefore use. TMAH (tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) is also available from the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology (StandardReference Material 723a) for this purpose.3.3 Buffer solutions, pH 4.0, 7.0, 1 0.0. 4 Procedure4.1 Standardize the 1.0 N Hydroch loric acid with theprimary standard.4.2 Standardize the titrator by perf orming a two pointcalibration with pH 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0 buffer.4.3 Pipette an appropriate aliquot (1 to 25 mL) ofsample into a 250 mL beaker containing a magnetic stirbar. Sample size should be determined according to theexpected normality and the amount of titrant to bedispensed that will give the optimum precision andaccuracy. Generally this is between one-half and three-quarters the capacity of the burette. (See the instrumentmanual for the recommended optimum range.)4.4 Add deionized water to bring t he volume toapproximately 150 mL.4.5 Without delay (to prevent carb on dioxideabsorption), begin stirring without a vortex and titrateto beyond the inflection endpoint. 4.6 Determine the exact endpoint and record thevolume of titrant consumed at the middle of theinflection endpoint. This will be done automatically onmost newer digital titrators. On analog titrators, theinflection point can be determined by using the firstderivative mode, or accurately determining the middleof the inflection. 5 Calculation5.1 Calculate the normality of the sample by thefollowing equation.

SEMI P12-0997 © SEMI 1991, 19971 SEMI P12-0997DETERMINATION OF IRON, ZINC, CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, COPPER,BORON, ALUMINUM, CHROMIUM, MANGANESE, AND NICKEL INPOSITIVE PHOTORESISTS BY INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMAEMISSION SPECTROSCOPY (ICP) 1 Scope1.1 This procedure is an ICP plasma emission analysisfor determination of iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium,copper, boron, aluminum, chromium, manganese, andnickel in photoresist. The applicable concentrationrange is 0.1 to 1 ppm when the sample is diluted 1 to 4.The precision was found to be within 0.1 ppm in around robin analysis between four laboratories. 2 Spectrometer2.1 A grating instrument with reso lution sufficient toseparate the analytical emission lines in Table 1 isrequired.Table 1 Analytical Lines of the Elements ElementsAnalyticalLine, nm ElementsAnalyticalLine, nmAluminum 309.271 Magnesium 285.213Calcium 317.933 Nickel 231.604Copper 324.754 Zinc 213.856Iron 239.562 Chromium 283.563Boron 208.960 Manganese 257.610 3 Sample Preparation3.1 The sample is diluted 1/4 (1 pa rt of sample plus 3parts of solvent weight/weight) in 2-methoxyethanol oranother suitable solvent for positive resist. The solventshould contain less than 0.03 ppm of the aboveelements. 4 Standards4.1 The standards should be weigh t/weight (mg/kg)and should be diluted weight/weight since results willbe expressed in mg/kg.4.2 The standards are prepared by diluting aconcentrated standard of organic-soluble metals in 2-methoxyethanol or other suitable solvent. For example,a 500 ppm standard is diluted to 50 ppm with xylene.This solution is then diluted to 0.25 ppm with 2-methoxythanol. 5 Plasma Conditions5.1 The sample is pumped on the r egion of 0.7mL/min, usually with a perstaltic pump attached to the nebulizer. Choose a tubing that is not attacked bymethyl cellosolve (for example, polytetrafluoro-ethylene). The argon plasma flow rate and RF powershould be optimized for the sample using settingsrecommended in the manufacturers manual. Generally,a plasma gas flow rate of 16 1/min. is necessary toionize organic solutions and an RF power of 1.7 wattsis required. 6 Quantitation6.1 The detector gain is set by mea suring the 0.25 ppmstandard. The background is measured with the solventand several sample measures. The standard and blankshould be run intermittently to satisfy reasonableprecision. Standard and sample readings should berepeatable within 0.03 ppm. The effect of sampleviscosity on delivery of diluted resist to the plasma wasnot found to be a factor for the resist tested for thisprocedure. This effect can be checked by adding aninternal standard of an element known not to be presentin the resist (such as Yttrium) at ppm and checking theemission response vs. external 1 ppm Yttrium standardin the diluting solvent. 7 Calculation7.1 ppm element (mg/kg = ppm m easured  delutionfactor (weight/weight)7.2 Detection Limit  The detecti on limit is afunction of the dilution factor and can vary byinstrument. The dilution factor should be taken intoaccount in calculation of detection limit.7.2.1 Detection limit (ppm) = s  dil ution factor wheres = standard deviation of instrument readings in ppm.

Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on July 11, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org September2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published in 1991. 1 Scope1.1 This procedure is a flame atomic absorptionanalytical method for sodium and potassium analysis inphotoresist. The applicable concentration range is 0.1 to1 ppm when the sample is diluted one to four. Theprecision was found to be within 0.1 ppm in a round-robin analysis between four laboratories.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 2 Referenced Standards2.1 None. 3 Terminology3.1.1 Detection Limit  the detection limit is afunction of the dilution factor and can vary byinstrument. The dilution factor should be taken intoaccount in calculation of detection limit. 4 Atomic Absorption Spectrometer4.1 The analytical wavelength for sodium is 589.0 nmand for potassium is 766.0 nm. The instrumentconditions (i.e., slit width, burner gas flow rates) shouldbe set according to the manufacturers manual (the fuelflow should be set to approximately 1/2 the air flow tooptimize for organic solvent). Optimize the nebulizerand lamp alignment to maximize the absorbance of the1 ppm standard. 5 Sample Preparation5.1 The sample should be diluted 1/4 (1 part resist and3 parts of solvents weight/weight) in 2-methoxyethanolor another suitable solvent for positive resist. Thesolvent should contain less than 0.1 ppm of the elementbeing analyzed. 6 Standards6.1 The standards should be weight/weight (mg/kg)and should be diluted weight/weight since results willbe expressed in mg/kg.6.2 The standards are prepared by diluting aconcentrated stock of organic-soluble sodium andpotassium. For example, a 500 ppm standard of sodiumis diluted to 50 ppm with reagent xylene. This solutionis then diluted to 1 ppm with 2-methoxyethanol oranother suitable solvent. 7 Procedure7.1 Set the absorbance reading to zero with the flameignited and no sample aspirating. Measure theabsorbance of the solvent blank. It should not be morethan 0.04. Measure the absorbance of the 1 ppmstandard and samples. The absorbance of the standardshould be in the region of 0.4. Duplicate sample andstandard readings should be within 0.01 absorbance. Arecovery of 88% was determined when a 1 ppmpotassium internal standard was added to the resisttested. The effect of viscosity on delivery to the burnercan be determined by adding 2 ppm of a potassiuminternal standard to the sample and checking theabsorbance versus an external 2 ppm potassiumstandard in the diluting solvent. The potassium level inthe resist, if any, should be subtracted. 8 Calculationppm (mg/kg) =Abs. Sample  ppm Standard  dilution factor  RAbs. Standard R = Recovery factor due to sample viscosity ifapplicable, for example 1.136 in above example.Detection limit (ppm) = s  dilution factor where s =standard deviation of instrument readings in ppm.

SEMI P17-92 © SEMI 1992, 19991 SEMI P17-92 (Reapproved 0299)DETERMINATION OF IRON, ZINC, CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, COPPER,BORON, ALUMINUM, CHROMIUM, MANGANESE, AND NICKEL INPOSITIVE PHOTORESIST METAL ION FREE (MIF) DEVELOPERS BYINDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY (ICP) This standard was technically reapproved by the Resist Committee and is the direct responsibility of the NorthAmerican Microlithography Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee in October 1998. Initially available at www.semi.org February 1999; to be published February 1999.Originally published in 1992; previously published in 1996.1 ScopeThis procedure is an ICP plasma emission analysis fordetermination of iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium,copper, boron, aluminum, chromium, manganese, andnickel in photoresist MIF developers. The applicableconcentration range and detection limit will dependupon the element and instrument. 2 SpectrometerAn instrument with resolution sufficient to separate theanalytical emission lines in Table 1 is required. Table 1. Analytical Lines of the Elements Elements Analytical Line nmAluminum 396.152Calcium 317.933Copper 324.754Iron 239.562Boron 208.960Magnesium 285.213Nickel 231.604Zinc 213.856Chromium 283.563Manganese 257.610 3 StandardsThe standards should be weight/weight (mg/kg) andshould be diluted weight/weight since results will beexpressed in mg/kg.The standards are prepared by diluting a concentratedstandard. For example, a 500 ppm standard is diluted to50 ppm with deionized water. This solution is thendiluted to 0.25 ppm. 4 Plasma ConditionsThe sample is pumped in the region of 0.7 mL/min.usually with a peristaltic pump attached to thenebulizer. The argon plasma flow rate and RF powershould be optimized for the sample using settingsrecommended in the manufacturer manual. Generally, aplasma gas flow rate of 12 L/min and an RF power of1.25 kW is required. 5 QuantitationNo sample preparation nor dilution is required.The detector gain is set by measuring the 0.25 ppmstandard. The standard should be run intermittently tosatisfy reasonable precision. Standard and samplereadings should be repeatable within 0.03 ppm. Theeffect of sample viscosity on delivery of diluted sampleto the plasma was not found to be a factor for thisprocedure. This effect can be checked by adding aninternal standard of an element known not to be presentin the sample (such as Yttrium) at 1 ppm and checkingthe emission response vs. an external 1 ppm Yttriumstandard. 6 Calculationppm element (mg/kg) = xs  0.25 ppm Where x = emission intensity of samples = emission intensity of 0.25 ppm standard

SEMI P18-92 © SEMI 1992, 20041 SEMI P18-92 (Reapproved 1104)SPECIFICATION FOR OVERLAY CAPABILITIES OF WAFERSTEPPERS This specification was technically reapproved by the Global Micropatterning Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Microlithography Committee. Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.orgSeptember 2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published in 1992. 1 Scope1.1 Definitions for the overlay capabilities of wafersteppers are established, consistent with the primaryapplication of wafer stepper (i.e., the manufacturing ofvery large-scale integrated circuits). Also included aredefinitions for associated parameters: registration,exposure field, good fields, and alignment.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 2 Referenced Standards2.1 Statistical methods shall be used in accordancewith the procedures in NBS Handbook #91(Experimental Statistics, by M.G. Natrella) and ASTMSTD 15D (Manual on the presentation of data andcontrol chart analysis).NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 3 Terminology3.1 Definitions3.1.1 overlay  a vector quantity defined at everypoint on the wafer. It is the difference, Or , between thevector position, 1Pr , of a substrate geometry, and thevector position of the corresponding point, 2Pr , in anoverlaying pattern, which may consist of photoresist: Or = 1Pr  2Pr 3.1.2 interfield overlay (also referred to as field-to-field overlay)  The center of the lens is chosen to be areference point. The overlay at the reference point ineach exposure field is the interfield overlay.3.1.3 exposure field  the area of a wafer covered by asingle exposure.3.1.4 intrafield overlay (also referred to as within-a-field overlay)  the overlay within an exposure field, relative to the overlay at the center of the lens referencelocation.NOTE 1: From these definitions, it follows that the overlay atany point on the wafer is the vector sum of interfield andintrafield overlays.3.1.5 registration  a vector quantity defined at everypoint on the wafer. It is the difference, Rr , between thevector position, 1Pr , of a substrate geometry, and vectorposition of the corresponding point, 0Pr , in a referencegrid: Rr = 1Pr - 0Pr 3.1.5.1 The reference grid must be clearly specified inany specification of registration.3.1.5.2 Interfield and intrafield registration are definedin a manner similar to interfield and intrafield overlay.3.1.5.3 Overlay may be computed from registrationmeasurements if the same reference standard is used onall systems for determining registration.3.1.6 alignment  the mechanical positioning ofreference points on the wafers (alignment targets) tothe corresponding points on the reticles. The measure ofalignment is the overlay at the position on the waferwhere the alignment targets are placed.3.1.7 Registration and overlay vectors shall bedecomposed into orthogonal components, X and Y,along the directions of the stepper stage motion.3.1.8 good fields  exposure fields in which themagnitude of the overlay at every point within the fieldis less than a specified value, V, in both the X and Ydirections, exclusive of contributions to overlay fromthe reticles and non-linear deformations of the wafersduring non-stepper processing.NOTE 2: It should be recognized that contributions fromreticles are non-statistical in nature, and that a particularreticle will make the same contributions to overlay andregistration in every exposure field in which it is imaged.

SEMI P18-92 © SEMI 1992, 2004 2 3.1.9 fraction of good field  the overlay capabilitiesof wafer steppers shall be quantified in terms of thefraction of good fields, F, out of the total number offields on the wafer: F = Number of good fieldsNumber of total fieldsGood fields may also be quantified as a percentage(100  F%).3.1.10 Any specification of overlay must define theapplicable exposure field size and the stepping patternson the wafers over which the specification applies.From Sections 3.1.8 and 3.1.9 it follows that thespecification of the overlay capability of wafer steppersconsists of at least two additional numbers, the overlayvalue, V, and the fraction of good fields, F. It isconsistent to characterize stepper overlay capability formultiple overlay values, V1, V 2, ... with correspondingmultiple fractions of good fields, F 1, F 2...

SEMI P19-92 © SEMI 1992, 19961 SEMI P19-92SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY PATTERN CELLS FORINTEGRATED CIRCUIT MANUFACTURE PurposeThis document defines several standard test patterns toprovide consistent industrywide evaluation and testingof micropatterning equipment, metrology instruments,and processes used in integrated circuit manufacturing. 1 General Specification1.1 Scope1.1.1 This specification defines the s hape, generalsize, and recommended placement and design rules(where appropriate) of several basic pattern cells forlinewidth metrology, resolution testing, and proximitytesting. These standard patterns include cells that can beused for optical microscopy, electron microscopy, andelectrical probe testing.1.1.2 This document does not attempt to specify themeasurement techniques to be used in verifying criticaldimensions for these test patterns on the reticle.Similarly, this document does not attempt to specifyhow the printed patterns are to be measured on thewafer. This document specifies only what the patternsare supposed to be; it is left to the user to ensure thatthe actual pattern conforms to this specification, subjectto all other applicable SEMI specifications. A separateSEMI document will specify CD measurementconditions (see Section 1.2.1).1.2 Applicable Documents1.2.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI P24  CD Metrology Procedures 1.3 Definitionslinewidth  In semiconductor technology, at a givencross-section of the line, the distance between theairline material boundaries at some specified heightabove the interface between the patterned layer inwhich the line is formed and the underlying layer (seeFigure 1). Figure 1Linewidth (X 0, Z0) = Y 2 - Y 1 NOTE: The physical basis for various methods of measuringlinewidth may result in the measurements being carried out atdiffering heights for the same line at the same cross-section.For this reason, substantial method-dependent differences inmeasurement results may be expected and it is convenient toidentify the method used in expressions such as SEMlinewidth, optical linewidth, or electrical linewidth(ASTM F 127). Furthermore, the height at which themeasurement is taken shall be qualitatively stated, even if itcannot be quantitively determined.feature  areas within a single, continuous boundary(for example, an aggregate image) that have an optical-density value (gray-level range), that is distinct fromthe background area outside the feature (ASTM D3849, D 24) (e.g., the simplest element of a pattern,such as a single line, space, or L-bar).feature group  a small assembly of one or moresimilar features arranged together, such as three nestedL-bars.nominal feature dimension  the linear dimension ofinterest, such as the linewidth or contact hole width.basic cell  an arrangement of features or groups, asdefined by this document, based upon a specific,nominal-feature dimension.composite cell  an arrangement of several basic cells.
