times\nin succession.\n9. 8  An Algorithm for Error Detection\n9. 8.1        When    implementing    error    detection,    it    is\nconvenient  to  imagine  a  checksum  for  each  individual\ncharacter position. This partial checksum forms a check\non  all  preceding  characters,  as  well  as  the  present\ncharacter.  Then  using  Horner's  Rule,  one  can  calculate\na  running  checksum  (that  is,  calculate  each  partial\nchecksum   in   order).   This   leads   to   the   following\nalgorithm.\n9. 8.2    Add  the  checksum  (or  the  previous  character\nposition  to  itself.  (For  the  first  character  position,  the\nvalue of the previous checksum is zero.) If the result is\n59  or  greater,  subtract  59.  This  leaves  a  value  in  the\nrange 0\u201358.\n9. 8.3  Add the result of step 1 to itself. If the result is 59\nor greater, subtract 59.\n9. 8.4  Add the result of step 2 to itself. If the result is 59\nor  greater,  subtract  59.  The  result  of  this  step  is  eight\ntimes the previous position checksum, modulo 59.\n9. 8.5  Add the result of step 3 to the numerical value of\nthe  character  in  the  present  position.  If  the  result  is  59\nor  greater,  subtract  59.  The  result  of  this  step  is  the\nchecksum for the present character position.\n9. 8.6      Repeat   steps   1   through   4   for   each   character\nposition. If the checksum for the final character position\nis nonzero, an error has occurred.\n9. 9  An Algorithm for Generating the Check Characters\n\u2014 The check characters can be generated as follows:\n9. 9.1  Initially, assume that the check characters are A0\n(the  first  check  character  is  the  letter  A,  the  second  is\nthe numeral 0).\n9. 9.2      Calculate   the   final   checksum   in   the   manner\ndescribed above for error detection. If the result is zero,\nthe  check  characters  are  correct,  and  the  algorithm\nterminates.\n9. 9.3  If the result of step 2 is nonzero, subtract it from\n59, yielding a number in the range 1\u201358.\n9. 9.4  Convert the result of step 3 to binary.\n9. 9.5    Add  the  least  significant  three  bits  of  the  binary\nnumber  to  the  numerical  value  of  the  second  assumed\ncheck  character  0  (numeral  zero).  This  will  yield  a\nvalue  that  corresponds  to  an  ASCII  character  in  the\nrange 0\u20137.\n9. 9.6  Add the next higher three bits of the binary num-\nber  to  the  numerical  value  of  the  first  assumed  check\ncharacter  A.

This partial checksum forms a check on all\npreceding  characters,  as  well  as  the  present  character.\nThen,  using  Horner\'s  Rule,  one  can  calculate  a  "run-\nning"  checksum  (that  is,  calculate  each  partial  check-\nsum in order). This leads to the following algorithm.\n7. 8.2    Add  the  checksum  for  the  previous  character\nposition  to  itself.  (For  the  first  character  position,  the\nvalue of the previous checksum is zero.) If the result is\n59  or  greater,  subtract  59.  This  leaves  a  value  in  the\nrange 0-58.\n7. 8.3    Add  the  result  of  Step  1  to  itself.  If  the  result  is\n59 or greater, subtract 59.\n7. 8.4    Add  the  result  of  Step  2  to  itself.  If  the  result  is\n59 or greater, subtract 59. The result of this step is eight\ntimes the previous position checksum, modulo 59.\n7. 8.5  Add the result of Step 3 to the numerical value of\nthe  character  in  the  present  position.  If  the  result  is  59\nor  greater,  subtract  59.  The  result  of  this  step  is  the\nchecksum for the present character position.\n7. 8.6    Repeat  Steps  1  through  4  for  each  character\nposition. If the checksum for the final character position\nis nonzero, an error has occurred.\n7. 9  An Algorithm for Generating the Check Characters\n\u2014 The check characters may be generated as follows:\n7. 9.1  Initially, assume that the check characters are A0\n(the  first  check  character  is  the  letter  A,  the  second  is\nthe numeral 0).\n7. 9.2      Calculate   the   final   checksum   in   the   manner\ndescribed above for error detection. If the result is zero,\nthe  check  characters  are  correct,  and  the  algorithm\nterminates.\n7. 9.3  If the result of Step 2 is nonzero, subtract it from\n59, yielding a number in the range 1\u201358.\n7. 9.4  Convert the result of Step 3 to binary.\n7. 9.5    Add  the  least  significant  three  bits  of  the  binary\nnumber  to  the  numerical  value  of  the  second  assumed\ncheck  character  0  (zero).  This  will  yield  a  value  that\ncorresponds to an ASCII character in the range 0\u20137.\n7. 9.6  Add the next higher three bits of the binary num-\nber  to  the  numerical  value  of  the  first  assumed  check\ncharacter  A.  This  will  yield  a  numerical  value  that\ncorresponds to an ASCII character in the range A\u2013H.\n7. 10  An  Illustrative  Example  \u2014  For  the  purpose  of\nillustrating  the  check  character  generating  algorithm,\nassume    that    the    message    consists    of    only    two\ncharacters,  the  digits  2  and  3.  Initially,  assume  that  the\ncheck   characters   are   A   and   0   (zero)   yielding   the\ncomposite message 23A0.\n7. 10.1  Initially, assume that the check characters are A\nand 0 (zero) yielding the composite message 23A0.\n7. 10.2    Using  the  algorithm  described  above,  the  final\nchecksum is found to be 33. Since this is nonzero, it is\nsubtracted  from  59,  yielding  26  in  decimal,  or  011010\nin binary.\n7. 10.3    The  least  significant  three  bits  010  (decimal\nvalue  2)  added  to  the  numerical  value  of  the  ASCII\ncharacter 0 (zero), which is 16, yields 18 (the numerical\nvalue of the ASCII character 2).\n7. 10.4  The final composite message is 23D2. The next\nhigher  three  bits  (011)  (decimal  value  3)  added  to  the\nnumerical value of the ASCII character A, which is 33,\nyields  36  (the  numerical  value  of  the  ASCII  character\nD).\nTable 4  Character Values\nASCII Character    ASCII Decimal Value   Numerical Value\n\u2013                                45                                13\n.                                46                                14\n0                                48                                16\n1                                49                                17\n2                                50                                18\n3                                51                                19\n4                                52                                20\n5                                53                                21\n6                                54                                22\n7                                55                                23\n8                                56                                24\n9                                57                                25\nA                               65                               33\nB                               66                               34\nC                               67                               35\nD                               68                               36\nE                               69                               37\nF                                70                                38\nG                               71                               39\nH                               72                               40\nI                                73                                41\nJ                                74                                42'),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M13-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1988, 2003 8\nASCII Character    ASCII Decimal Value   Numerical Value\nK                               75                               43\nL                               76                               44\nM                               77                               45\nN                               78                               46\nO                               79                               47\nP                                80                                48\nQ                               81                               49\nR                               82                               50\nS                                83                                51\nT                               84                               52\nU                               85                               53\nV                               86                               54\nW                               87                               55\nX                               88                               56\nY                               89                               57\nZ                               90                               58"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M13-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1988, 2003 9\nAPPENDIX 1\nSEMI OCR CHARACTER OUTLINES\nNOTICE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  M13  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot  procedures  on\nJuly 12, 1998."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M13-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1988, 2003 10"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M13-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1988, 2003 11"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M13-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1988, 2003 12"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for any\nparticular  application.
