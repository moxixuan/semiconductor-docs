SEMI S17-0701 © SEMI 2001 4 8 Emergency Shutdown8.1 Emergency Shutdown for both Space-Travelingand Floor-Traveling Vehicles  In addition to theemergency shutdown provisions of SEMI S2, UTVequipment should also conform to the followingprovisions.8.1.1 The UTV should be equipped with an emergencyoff (EMO) circuit that, when activated, immediatelystops the operation and motion of the UTV, includingboth travel and load/unload operation. The EMO circuitshould be activated whenever the following actionsoccurs:a) An EMO button on the UTV is pressed.b) An EMO at a fixed floor location is pressed.NOTE 4: See Section 9.2 for handheld remote control.8.1.2 Once an EMO circuit has been activated, theUTV should not move under its own power until thecause of the emergency condition has been resolved andthe system has been reset by a human operation. Thesystem should not reset or restart automatically.8.2 Position of EMO Buttons on F loor-TravelingVehicles  Structure-mounted EMO buttons should belocated for easy accessibility by factory personnel.8.2.1 Vehicle-mounted EMO Button s should beaccessible and visible from all sides of the vehicle,typically on the four-corners of a floor-travelingvehicle.8.3 Position of EMO Buttons for S pace-TravelingVehicle Systems EMO buttons should be located foreasy accessibility by factory personnel, for example: Near control panels or operator terminals includinghandheld vehicle remote controls. Near process equipment load ports or stations. On walls or other fixed locations in the factory areawhere space-traveling vehicles operate.NOTE 5: Some end user customers may request EMO buttonsincluded on the space-traveling vehicle.8.3.1 Since space-traveling vehicle E MO buttons aretypically remote from the vehicles, space-travelingsystems should provide a method of determining thelocation of the activated EMO button. This will ensurethat the emergency condition can be identified andresolved prior to resetting the system per Section 8.1.2. 9 Manual Operation9.1 Manual Movement of both Spa ce Traveling andFloor-Traveling Vehicles  When the EMO is activated, the UTV should be capable of brake releaseto allow for release of a potentially trapped person.9.1.1 The UTV should be equipped with a manualmovement function that permits a human operator tomaneuver the vehicle in the event of a problem. In theevent of a problem, manual movement of all vehiclefunctions including travel and load/unload should beallowed.9.2 Manual/Remote Operation of b oth Space-Traveling and Floor-Traveling Vehicles  Except forEMO and E-Stop, any control of a vehicle outside ofautomated operation should be exclusive. Otherdevices should not override vehicle control or causemovement of more than one vehicle at a time.EXCEPTION: Those controls that do not cause motion.9.2.1 Manual control of a vehicle motion that couldpresent a hazard if control is lost should be controlledwith an enabling type switch, such that movement isenabled only when a switch is continuously held(pressed) by an operator.9.2.1.1 Handheld remote controls shou ld have an E-Stop or EMO function to allow operators to stopmovement that could cause risk to themselves or others.If remote control is wireless, this function should not bemarked or labeled as an EMO.9.2.1.2 During handheld remote contr ol operation, theUTV should stop any vehicle motion that could create ahazard if power or the communication signal is lost. 10 Vehicle Travel10.1 Collision Avoidance for both S pace-Travelingand Floor-Traveling Vehicles  UTVs should providefor protection of persons in the same traveling spacefrom injury. Damage to property or equipment fromtraveling vehicles should also be prevented.10.1.1 The UTV system supplier shou ld providedocumentation specifying safe practices for workingwithin traveling space of the UTVs, to includedocumented administrative procedures necessary towork safely while performing maintenance on or nearoperating UTV systems.10.1.2 UTVs should be equipped with non-contactapproach sensing system so those vehicles do notinadvertently contact people or other obstacles duringthe traveling motion of the UTV. Non-contactapproach sensing systems should consist of eitherelectromechanical (preferred) or solid-state devices andcomponents and be designed to be fault-tolerant.10.1.2.1 If an overhead vehicle is provi ded with afault-tolerant contact sensing system (such as a bumperswitch), as primary safety protection for people, the

&lt;!-- Page 7 --&gt;

SEMI S17-0701 © SEMI 20015 circuitry of the secondary non-contact system is notlimited to electromechanical or solid state devices andcomponents.10.1.2.2 Where solid-state devices and componentsare used in an approach sensing system circuit, thesystem and relevant parts of the system should beevaluated for suitability for use. Abnormal conditionssuch as overvoltage, undervoltage, power supplyinterruption, transient overvoltage, ramp voltage,electromagnetic susceptibility, electrostatic discharge,thermal cycling, humidity, dust, vibration, and jarringshould be considered.EXCEPTION: When the severity of a reasonably foreseeablemishap is deemed to be Minor per SEMI S10, a softwarebased control may be considered suitable.10.1.2.3 Upon request by the user custo mer, suppliersshould provide a test piece or set of test pieces(appropriate to the sensor device provided) along withprocedures for testing and calibration.10.1.3 When a UTV detects a vehicle or obstacle, theUTV should decelerate and stop automatically before ittouches that vehicle or obstacle. If the non-contactapproach sensing device should be disabled (forexample because the UTV is negotiating a sharp turn),the UTV should decelerate and issue a warning (seeHazard Alarms and Displays section of this document)to indicate that the sensing device has been disabled.10.1.4 In an area where multiple UTV s are operating,the capability to prevent the collision of one vehiclewith another should be provided and to satisfy Section10.1.3, should consider the following conditions:a) The distance between a given vehicle and thevehicle that follows it.b) The timing at which one stream of vehicles mergeswith another.c) The timing at which a vehicle branches out from astream of vehicles to pass another vehicle movingtoward it.d) The distance that separates two vehicles when theypass each other.10.2 Collision Detection for Floor-T raveling Vehicles In addition to Section 10.1, floor-traveling vehiclesshould also be equipped with a contact sensing device(such as a bumper switch) capable of detecting collisionin the direction in which motion can create a hazard.10.2.1 The bumpers should have a sh ape and structurethat does not pose a risk to personnel or to objectsaround the floor-traveling vehicle.10.2.2 The bumpers should be equal t o or larger thanthe width of the floor-traveling vehicle body, as measured perpendicular to the direction of its travelingmotion.10.2.3 The maximum allowable dista nce between abumper and the floor is 15 mm (0.6 inch).EXCEPTION: If this provision cannot be maintained, (suchas when the floor-traveling vehicle enters an elevator, orchanges in floor height) the distance should be explicitlystated in the operation manuals (and the specifications) as analert or warning notice to appropriate personnel.10.2.4 If an obstacle contacts a bump er, the floor-traveling vehicle should be able to stop within thebumper stroke, irrespective of the speed at which thevehicle is traveling. If this provision cannot be met fortechnical reasons, the floor-traveling vehicle suppliershould clearly indicate the maximum speed at which thevehicle can stop within the bumper stroke.10.2.5 There should not be any devic e that disables thefunctionality of the bumper switch or sensor on floor-traveling vehicles.10.2.6 If a bumper switch or sensor h as been activatedby contact, a floor-traveling vehicle should not restartuntil the system has been reset by a human operation.NOTE 6: Since space-traveling vehicles travel in dedicatedspace above the heads of factory personnel, criteria for space-traveling vehicle bumpers are not included.10.3 Protective Zones for Space-Tr aveling Vehicles Written administrative procedures for creating aprotective zone around personnel, required to workoverhead in the path of space-traveling vehicles, shouldbe included in documentation provided by the UTVsystem supplier.NOTE 7: Implementation of these administrative proceduresis the responsibility of the end user customer.10.4 Travel Speed of Floor-Travelin g Vehicles Floor-traveling vehicles, intended for use in areaswhere there are both operating vehicles and personnelpresent, should be equipped with a variable speed-setting mechanism.10.4.1 The variable speed settings de signed for use inareas with both operating vehicles and personnel shouldnot exceed 60 meters/minute (196 feet/minute). Anyvariable speed settings exceeding 60 meters/minute(196 feet/minute) should be reserved for use indedicated and unmanned areas for which personnelsafety can be assured.10.4.2 The variable speed setting mec hanism of afloor-traveling vehicle should be designed so that onlyauthorized personnel, following access controlprocedures, can change the vehicles speed setting.NOTE 8: Criteria for traveling speeds of space-travelingvehicles are not included in this sub-section.

If these gases are mixed withstronger oxidizing gases than air, combustion andexplosion energies can radically increase.6.1.2 Dichlorosilane (SiH2Cl2) is pyrophoric andtrichlorosilane (SiHCl3) is flammable. Dichlorosilane(SiH 2Cl2) and trichlorosilane (SiHCl3) are alsocorrosive gases. If these gases are mixed with

&lt;!-- Page 16 --&gt;

SEMI S18-1102 © SEMI 2002 4 moisture, corrosivity can radically increase andpyrophoric byproduct gases might also be produced.NOTE 2: The most recent and best research on DCS puts theAIT (Auto Ignition Temperature) at 44 degrees C plus/minus3 degrees C, or about 111 degrees F. It should be notedhowever, that unlike silane, DCS is not expected to autoignitein almost all ambient conditions where we would find it inuse. For fire protection purposes it can be treated as a highlyflammable gas.6.2 Risk Management Strategies  Fundamentalconcepts of safety and accident prevention are:6.2.1 An understanding of facilities, piping andequipment, from storage to gas abatement, is essentialfor safe handling of silane family gases insemiconductor or FPD manufacturing facilities.6.2.2 The safety of facilities can be enhanced byimplementation of designs for sources, piping andequipment that use devices with fail-safe, foolproof,self-diagnostic and predictive functions.6.2.3 Safety systems should detect current safety statusand generate notices that indicate conditions of elevatedrisk, through computer self-diagnosis and dedicatedSSCS devices. If the SSCSs cannot confirm normaloperation of assigned silane family gas handling systemor unit, the silane family gas supply shouldautomatically be shut off.6.2.3.1 SSCSs can determine if a safe status has beenachieved before proceeding to the next step in a silanefamily gas handling process.6.2.3.2 SSCSs should be provided in distributionfacilities, cylinder cabinets, process equipment, gastreatment systems, and the like.6.2.4 Safe design depends on equipment designers andfacilities designers understanding of silane family gasproperties and hazards. Design methods for controllingthese hazards require full integration of measures fromall portions of the delivery and use systems.NOTE 3: Information on silane family gases hazards isavailable from various sources, including: regulations,MSDSs, Factory Mutual Loss Prevention Data Sheets, NFPAStandards, consensus Building Codes, and various researchpapers.6.2.4.1 The supplier should complete, prior to use, ahazard identification and risk assessment \[such asProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA), Hazard andOperability Analysis (Haz-Op), Failure Mode EffectsAnalysis (FMEA)\], for all silane family gas systems.6.2.4.2 The results of the analysis should be reportedusing the SEMI S10 risk matrix. 6.2.5 Minimization of Quantity  The quantity of anysilane family gas online and in use should be limited tothe smallest amount necessary for effective production.NOTE 4: Separation and setback considerations for silanefamily gas storage and dispensing areas must be inaccordance with jurisdictional requirements.6.2.6 Periodic accident prevention assessments shouldbe performed to assist in minimizing incidentfrequency.6.3 Isolation (Lockout/Tagout)  Isolation (lockout/tag out) capability should be provided for all silanesources at all levels necessary to perform service ormaintenance safely on silane family gas systems.6.3.1 Energy isolation of all other energy sources (e.g.,electrical, mechanical) should be performed, asappropriate, to provide safety for personnel working onenergy systems associated with silane family gases.NOTE 5: Maintenance on energized non-hazardous electricalsystems may not be safe when a silane family gas is present inthe system.6.4 Access Control6.4.1 Multiple level access control, to each point whereany hazard may exist in a normal or failure state, shouldbe provided for all silane family gas systems.6.5 All personnel concerned in silane family gashandling should be trained for the jobs they are toperform and hazards to which they will be exposed. Allsuch training should be formally documented and ifregulations apply then the documentation should be inaccordance with the regulations.6.5.1 Audits of system status and equipment conditionshould be performed and documented on a periodicbasis.6.5.2 The operator or technician should be capable ofchecking the current status and any abnormal conditionbefore beginning work on any system or sub-system.6.5.3 Evacuation and Purging6.5.3.1 When connecting silane family gas piping toequipment, the air in the piping should be purged outwith inert gas such as nitrogen into a safe location toprevent reaction with silane family gases.6.5.3.2 To enable purging without venting into unsafelocations, a purge port should be installed at locationswhere sealed systems require purging. Purge portsshould have a stop valve and, if not connected to thepurge gas, should be sealed with a cap or plug.

&lt;!-- Page 17 --&gt;

SEMI S18-1102 © SEMI 20025 6.5.3.3 The user should introduce silane family gasesonly after purging oxidizing gases and otherincompatible gases, materials or substances from thesystem.6.5.3.4 Silane family gas systems should haveprocedures based on calculated minimum purge cycles,minimum purge-gas pressures, and necessary vacuumlevels to insure the system has been adequately purgedbefore being opened to atmosphere. Calculations areneeded to define minimum number of cycles. Processpurges typically far exceed this number of cycles,therefore testing is usually not necessary.6.5.3.5 An adequate means should be provided to avoida cross contamination of purge gases and the processgases by accidental backflow.6.5.3.6 Separation of purge gas and silane family gasesshould not solely depend on check valves. A controlvalve, such as a pneumatic valve placed before or afterthe check valve, is preferred for isolating silane familygases from other gases during procedures that mightallow reverse flow.6.5.4 The purge gas for silane family gases should besupplied from dedicated source containers.NOTE 6: Some regional codes (e.g., Japans High PressureGas Safety Law) require a purge gas source which is totallyseparated from the purge gas source for oxidizer gas lines.6.5.4.1 Purge lines from dedicated bulk supplies(where allowed at all by the jurisdiction) should havemulti-level back-flow and pressure differentialprotection to prevent potential back-flow of pyrophoricgases into bulk systems.NOTE 7: Back-flow into these bulk purge systems has beenknown to generate ignitable mixtures when the inert gas isexposed to atmosphere far from the source of contamination. 7 Education and TrainingNOTE 8: It is important for managers as well as employeesto deepen their understanding of the characteristics of gasesthat they handle, so as to ensure safe work practices.

The back up power should be periodicallytested or inspected and the test or inspectiondocumented.NOTE 16: The testing, the inspection, and the documentationmust be in accordance with any applicable regulations.8.7 There may be a need for gas detection in someexhaust treatment systems to detect breakthrough. Seethe Exhaust Treatment System section for details.NOTE 17: Gas detector monitoring in ducts may be requiredby regulation or permits. 9 Fire Detection, Suppression, and AlarmSystems9.1 Alarms should connect to the facility under theguidelines of SEMI S2.9.2 Fire Detection and suppression system(s) whereused should be operational at all times, including whenequipment or facilities are shut down or in maintenancemodes. See SEMI S14 for guidelines for determiningwhether such systems are appropriate and for designingthem.EXCEPTION 1: Maintenance of the fire detection system.EXCEPTION 2: Activation of the fire detection systemshould not remove power from fire detection system andsafety systems.9.3 Fire Detection and Suppression for Bulk SilaneSystems9.3.1 An automatic fixed water spray system should beprovided for any bulk silane system for purposes ofcooling the system only.9.3.1.1 The regulator station and control panel areasshould also be protected by a water spray system forpurposes of cooling the system only.NOTE 18: Design density, area and duration should becalculated appropriate to the surface area of the containerusing a method such as the one provided in NFPA 318.9.3.2 Activation of the optical flame detectors, manualactivation, or heat-link activators should initiate thewater spray system and should close emergency shutoffvalves (ESOVs). ESOVs should be located directly onthe source or on the piping, as close to the container aspossible. 9.4 Fire Detection and Suppression9.4.1 Fires within valve manifold boxes (VMBs) mayimpinge on other lines within the VMBs. If this isassessed as an unacceptable risk, there may be a needfor fire protection.9.4.2 When fire protection is installed, it should remainactive during all conditions such as maintenance andservice.EXCEPTION: Maintenance of the fire protection system. 10 Emergency Response10.1 Exhaust and abatement systems should be leftrunning during any emergency event, including fire inthe facility.10.2 Evacuation of Personnel10.2.1 Procedures for evacuation, as a result of a gasleak, should be developed based on a hazard analysisand should be appropriate to the level of hazard.10.2.2 After an evacuation, no one should re-enter thearea until the exposure risk has been reduced to anacceptable level.10.2.3 All personnel in the facility should be trainedregarding proper evacuation procedures.10.3 Leak Identification and Isolation10.3.1 If the appropriate method of achieving a safesituation is for a response team to enter, only authorizedand trained response personnel may enter to locate andfix the leak.10.3.2 If the leak location can be accuratelydetermined, the specific source supplying silane familygases to the leak location should be automatically shutdown.10.3.3 If the leak location cannot be accuratelydetermined, all of the systems supplying the area wherethe leak was detected should be shut down.10.3.4 Do not enclose a silane installation whereadequate exhaust flow can not remain during a leak.This could lead to an explosion.10.4 Recovery from Leaks10.4.1 Trained personnel should investigate theincident until the original or root cause is determined.Systems should not be restarted until the safety of theentire system is confirmed.10.4.2 Sufficiently purge all affected systems with aninert gas.

Perform corrective actions if necessary.10.5 Fire and Explosion10.5.1 The only safe way to extinguish a gas fire is toshut off the source.NOTE 19: Do not attempt to extinguish any gas fire exceptby shutting off the source. Many countries require fireextinguishers at gas storage areas, but these should be usedfor extinguishing things other than the gas, or for escape.10.5.2 Water spray or deluge systems should be usedonly to cool the container or adjacent containers toprevent other cylinders from heating or over-pressurizing.10.5.3 Accidental extinguishing of a gas fire withoutshutting off the gas presents an unacceptable risk ofexplosion.10.5.4 When fire is suspected, contact the emergencyresponders.NOTE 20: Local fire departments may not be trained insilane family gas fires. The emergency responders shouldinclude plant emergency response teams or public hazardresponse teams, as well as fire departments.10.5.5 Only trained personnel should enter an areaaffected by a silane family gas fire.10.5.5.1 Trained responders to a fire event should bewearing appropriate protective equipment beforeentering the area.10.5.5.2 After a fire event, check the reliability ofinstalled fire detectors. Change the detectors ifnecessary. 11 Materials, Components, and Constructionsfor Silane Family Gas Handling Equipment andFacilities11.1 Material  Material used for piping andcomponents for silane family gas should be suitable formaintaining structural integrity.11.1.1 Combustible materials (as defined in SEMI S2)should not be used in constructing assemblies thatcontact, support or make up structural components ofsilane family gas handling equipment, unlessspecifically designed as safety devices.11.1.2 Materials such as SUS304, SUS316, SUS316L, Monel, Hastelloy or XM-27 may be needed to provideadequate protection from corrosion related tochlorosilanes.11.1.3 Dust caps for chlorosilanes, plastic gaskets orO-rings for secondary seals should be made ofchemically stable and heat-resistive materials (e.g.,PTFE) of a suitable size to fit the cap.11.2 Components11.2.1 Components should be nationally approved,conform to national standards, or be accompanied bydata that demonstrates safety and compatibility.11.2.2 When cylinder connection gaskets are used theyshould be single-use metal-surface compression gaskets(unless incompatible) that do not provide a source ofadditional fuel.11.2.3 Components used in the piping should beselected with structures that minimize dead leg sections.11.2.4 Gas cabinet or equipment suppliers shouldprovide the user with reliability data for repeatedoperations, so the user can schedule replacement of thecomponents within their expected lifetimes.11.2.5 If a pneumatic valve is used, the operating gasshould be nitrogen (N 2) or another inert gas.11.3 Construction11.3.1 Equipment, facilities and piping should beprotected from electrostatic discharge.11.3.2 Assembly of stainless steel components shouldbe by welding wherever possible to reduce the need forexhausted enclosures.11.3.3 Fittings  Fittings should be welded,(preferably orbital-butt-welded) wherever possible.Mechanical joints (metal-gasket face-seal fittings)should be used when disassembly will be required.NOTE 21: Compression fittings lead to increased risk ofleaks, especially when subjected to expansion and contractionby temperature changes.11.3.4 Only cylinder connections approved by arecognized authority such as the Compressed GasAssociation (CGA) should be used on gas cylinders, toprevent connection of a cylinder containing anincompatible gas.NOTE 22: Special style connections such as CGA-DISS canprovide added protection by their use of keyeddifferentiation between gas types. 12 Pressurization and Leak Testing12.1 Each supply piping system should be bothpressure-tested and leak tested.

Air flow should be directed acrosspotential leak points to prevent pocketing.NOTE 40: Recommendations for cabinet exhaust areprovided in RI-2.14.3.8.1.1.1 The forced exhaust system for silanefamily gas should have capability of treating worst caseleak. The treatment may be accomplished by either anabatement system or dilution of silane family gas tobelow 25% of the lower flammable limit.14.3.8.1.1.1.1 A worst case leak is typically a full-flowrelease rate from the largest cylinder installed throughthe Flow Limiting Device at full cylinder pressure.14.3.8.1.2 The exhaust system should be provided withautomatic emergency source of backup power.NOTE 41: Jurisdictional requirements may define backuppower.NOTE 42: Many jurisdictions require sensors, detectors, andlighting fixtures all to be of electrical construction meetinghazardous location requirements (e.g., not less than NECClass 1 Div. 2.) in rooms classified as flammable rooms.NOTE 43: In some jurisdictions, the exhaust and abatementsystem may not be required to operate continuously, providedwhen a leak is detected, the forced exhaust and abatementsystem be activated to abate the leak.14.3.8.2 Mechanical ventilation should be provided forthe gas cabinet to keep inner pressure of the cabinetnegative to atmosphere. The effectiveness of theventilation should be monitored.14.3.8.3 Vent lines of the high pressure side of theregulator of silane family gas cylinders should berouted to an abatement system when applicable to meetjurisdictional requirements. The system should have thecapability to abate the largest possible flow through thecylinder flow restrictor.14.3.8.4 Excess flow switches should be providedupstream of the regulator, either in conjunction withhigh pressure process valves or on the pigtailimmediately downstream of the cylinder valve. This isto limit the maximum flow of gas to the regulator. 14.3.9 Special Cylinder Issues14.3.9.1 Cylinder Change Procedures14.3.9.1.1 A well defined method of leak checkingshould be performed after a new cylinder is installedand prior to final pigtail purging to insure cylinderconnection leak-tight integrity.14.3.9.1.2 Appropriate personal protective equipment(PPE) should be worn during cylinder handling andchanging.14.3.9.1.3 Before opening the cabinet door to replace acylinder, a visual inspection for silicon dioxide (SiO 2)powder should be performed. If SiO 2 is present, it isevidence of a leak in the system, and the door shouldnot be opened until the gas supply is shut off and, ifpossible, purged remotely. Adequate precautions shouldbe taken as trapped pockets of silane may ignite.14.3.9.2 Cylinder should be transported with thecylinder valve plug securely tightened and the cylindervalve protective cap in-place.14.3.9.3 Cylinder replacement should be performed bytwo persons. Each should have received appropriatetraining to perform their tasks safely.14.3.9.4 Cylinders should be transported onappropriate carriages with adequate means for fixingthe cylinder to the carriage.14.4 Changing Sources14.4.1 To prevent air from entering a silane family gassystem during container change, a constant purge of theconnection should be operating during the entire timethe supply is not connected.14.4.1.1 To prevent accidental intake of air into thesource container, the source container pressure shouldbe maintained above atmospheric pressure and replacedby new one before the pressure drops to atmosphericpressure.14.4.1.2 At a certain minimum pressure, a warningshould be provided to an attended location and the gasshut down.14.4.2 Auto-sequence Controllers  Auto-sequencecontrollers are recommended whenever possible toreduce the potential for human error in supply change-out.14.4.2.1 When an auto sequence controller is used, theleak test after replacement of the cylinder should bedesigned to monitor the pressures continuously withinthe purging supply system. Interrupted monitoring maynot capture a pressure change that indicates ineffectivepurging.

&lt;!-- Page 24 --&gt;

SEMI S18-1102 © SEMI 2002 12 14.4.2.1.1 The design of automatic-sequence controlsystems for cylinder cabinets should incorporate thefollowing features:a) Fault-tolerant design,b) The ability to perform a leak check of thecontainer by measuring pressure rise in thesystem, with the container valve closed, underthe condition that the container has beenconnected and the purge gas eliminated,c) Continuous pressure monitoring of the systemduring all purges and operating conditions, andd) Written procedures for safe source containerreplacement including verificationrequirements for the leak testing andverification of the sensing system function.NOTE 44: All tasks assessed as high risk (from the riskassessment) should minimize human interaction as much aspossible. 15 Distribution Systems for Gas Supply15.1 General Considerations15.1.1 To enable purging without venting into unsafelocations, a purge port should be installed at locationswhere sealed systems require purging. Purge portsshould have a stop valve, if not connected to the purgegas, should be sealed with a cap or plug.15.1.2 Dead leg sections (internal piping which cantrap silane family gases) should be minimized to thesmallest volume possible.15.1.3 An excess flow control valve should be installedon every silane family gas piping system as close aspractical to the source. The excess flow control valveshould be sized to deliver only as much gas asnecessary to the process requirements.NOTE 45: See Related Information 3 for an example.15.1.3.1 Silane family gas delivery systems should beequipped with the following controls and safeguards:a) Excess flow protection,b) A manual shutdown valve at both the point ofdispensing and in the distribution line near orin the equipment gas box, andc) Over-pressure monitors with pressure reliefand automatic gas shutoff when pressure isdetected above the designed limit. 15.2 Location and Construction15.2.1 Piping General15.2.1.1 Piping should be welded throughout orcontained within an exhausted enclosure.EXCEPTION: Non-welded piping, outdoors, may not requirean enclosure.15.2.1.2 Piping should be labeled with the gas nameand flow direction.15.2.1.3 If the piping diverges into two or more lines,each line should be provided with a shut off valve.NOTE 46: Some jurisdictions require both manual andautomatic shut off valves.15.2.1.3.1 These valves should enable cycle purging ofeach line.15.2.1.3.2 These valves should be provided with anexhausted enclosure.15.2.1.3.3 The enclosure should be monitored withdetectors for the silane family gases present.15.2.1.4 The ventilated enclosures should have exhaustmonitoring per SEMI S2.15.2.1.5 The piping of oxidizer gases should beisolated from the piping of silane family gases. Theisolation should also be applied to silane family gaspurge lines.15.2.2 Coaxial PipingNOTE 47: Some jurisdictions require building-runs of silanefamily gas piping to be of secondarily contained (coaxial)construction. Some believe there is little evidence thatcoaxial piping for these gases is appropriate, as long as non-welded fittings are within secondary enclosures. Coaxialpiping may add substantial costs and other hazards whichshould then be addressed. However, pressurized, monitored,and interlocked coax lines provide a local warning to personswho accidentally damage the jacket. The sound of theescaping inert gas used to pressurize the jacket alerts theworker. The interlock alerts the facility of the breach, andreduces the total amount of process gas lost if the inner line isdamaged.15.2.2.1 When coaxial piping is installed, the annularspace should be pressurized with helium or other inertgas, purged, or maintained at a vacuum.15.2.2.2 If a purge method is used, the purge gasesfrom the coaxial piping should be monitored withdetectors for the specific silane family gas.15.2.2.2.1 This detector should shut down the sourcewhen a leak is detected.15.2.2.3 If a pressure or vacuum method is used, thepressure or vacuum in this annular space should be

&lt;!-- Page 25 --&gt;

SEMI S18-1102 © SEMI 200213 monitored and should alarm at a constantly attendedlocation when a change occurs.15.2.2.3.1 The alarm should also shut off the silanefamily gas at the nearest up-stream valve.15.2.2.4 A procedure for responding to an annularspace alarm, and determining the nature of the hazardcondition, should be created.15.3 Flow Components15.3.1 The state of a valve (open or closed) should beindicated through display or on the valve itself. Thesupplier should provide the user with reliability data forrepeated operations, and the user should replace thevalve within its expected lifetime.15.4 Heaters and Heat Insulation Materials External heating of piping and regulators may berequired in outside locations or long distance lines toprevent re-liquification. In such cases, the followingshould be considered:15.4.1 If electrical resistance heating is used withinsulation, the insulation should be visually inspectedperiodically for degradation or exposed wiring to avoidelectrical arcing and damage to the piping.15.4.1.1 Electrical resistance piping heating systemsshould not be placed in wet areas because of theincreased possibility of damage from corrosion.15.4.2 Electrical resistance piping heating systemsshould be monitored. Monitors should alarm in theevent of over temperature, an open circuit or a shortcircuit and should shut off the power supply and gassupply.15.4.2.1 Gas supply shutdown may be required bysome jurisdictions.NOTE 48: Heaters must conform to jurisdictionalrequirements for the device type. 16 Equipment Using Silane Family Gases16.1 Design16.1.1 Coaxial piping within process equipment is notusually practical, but piping between equipment gasbox and process chambers should be coaxial piping ifthe piping is both pressurized and outside of exhaustedand leak-monitored enclosures.16.1.2 Safe State  Equipment should be designed sothat detection of a silane release immediately sends theequipment into a safe state. Safe shutdown of theequipment itself or silane family gas sources may beappropriate.16.1.2.1 Any silane process vacuum pump, when used,should be maintained and monitored for its ability to safely remove potentially hazardous silane family gasesfrom equipment for maintenance and repair.NOTE 49: For fire detection, suppression, and alarm criteriasee Section 9.16.1.3 Fire detection system activation should shut offflammable and pyrophoric gases supplying theequipment being monitored, as this is the only safemethod of extinguishing gas fires.16.1.4 Equipment using silane family gases should becapable of performing a purge/vacuum sequence topurge the silane family gas to prevent chemical reactiondamage before service or maintenance.16.1.4.1 The minimum number of purge/vacuumcycles should be decided according to the results oftests that evaluate the sequence effectiveness.16.1.4.2 The equipment supplier should provide theminimum safe number of cycles to the user based uponthe baseline process.16.1.4.3 If adjustable, this minimum number of cyclesshould be controlled in such a way that the user isaware of the consequences of changing the cycle count,and access to the means of changing the cycle count islimited to maintenance or service personnel, but notoperators.16.1.5 When the appropriate number of purge cyclesfor the users own process are determined by the user,the number should not be less than the minimumnumber of cycles recommended by the equipmentsupplier.16.1.5.1 If unusual circumstances appear to reduce thenumber of cycles needed, the supplier should beconsulted for a recommendation specific to thecircumstances.16.1.6 If a system is designed to supply a silane familygas and a gas with which the silane family gas canreact, to a chamber simultaneously, the flows should becontrolled to avoid concentrations and pressures ofthose gases that would pose unacceptable risks.16.1.6.1 The equipment should be designed so that itwill not initiate the next process step if a gas mixturecondition that would pose unacceptable risks exists.16.1.6.2 The equipment should not allow additionalgas to flow until any unsafe gas condition alarm hasbeen manually reset.16.1.6.3 Silane family gases and incompatible gasesshould have separate piping up to the point where asystem EMO or a safe-state function can shut them off.

SEMI S18-1102 © SEMI 2002 14 16.1.6.4 A hazard analysis of the system, beyond thesafe-state shut off, should be used to determineadequate protection.16.1.6.5 No single component failure should allow forincompatible gases to mix, in manifolds or other areas,in pressures and concentrations that would poseunacceptable risks.16.2 Construction16.2.1 Equipment interface points for the gas supplypiping should be designed with seismic bracing asneeded to achieve the seismic protection detailed inSEMI S2.16.2.1.1 The external force on the bending point shouldbe minimized by use of reverse bending or othermethods.16.2.1.2 The tensile strength of joints should becompliant with the appropriate piping standard for thejurisdiction (such as ASTM/ANSI, ISO, or JIS).16.2.2 Dead leg sections (internal piping which cantrap silane family gases) should be minimized to thesmallest volume possible.16.2.3 Chambers intended for silane family gasprocesses should be evaluated for their ability towithstand reasonably foreseeable events related to thesilane family gases such as fire or explosion that arisefrom single point failures.16.2.3.1 If viewing ports are used they should bedesigned to the same capability as the chamber, or beprovided with safety devices to capture any potentialflying debris before it affects personnel or otherequipment.16.2.3.1.1 If viewing ports are intended to be userreplaceable, the user documentation should specify thepart and the change procedure and warn the user of thepossible consequences of using an alternate part.16.2.3.2 If an enclosure is required to contain chamberrupture, such an enclosure should be ventilated andevaluated per SEMI S2 and SEMI S6.16.2.3.2.1 If the chamber rupture protection is anenclosure, the enclosure panels should be interlocked toprevent process initiation or continuance if theenclosure is open.16.2.4 Flame sensors or leak detectors should beinstalled in all areas that may accumulate silane familygases from a leak.16.2.5 The results of the tracer gas tests specified inSEMI S2 and SEMI F15, should indicate that ambientconcentration of silane family gases will be less than the level specified in SEMI S2 during maintenanceactivities or delivery system failure.16.3 Vacuum Pump Systems16.3.1 Materials of construction for vacuum pumpsthat are exposed to the gas stream should be compatiblewith the gas stream.16.3.2 Vacuum pumps that are exposed to the gasstream should be dry type or use inert (non-hydrocarbon) oil.16.3.3 Purge gases for vacuum pumps should benitrogen (N 2) or other inert gas. The flow rate of thepurge gas should be sufficient to dilute the silane familygas to below the lower explosive limit until the gas hassafely passed into the burn box or abatement system. Ifa combined pump/abatement system is used, thiscriterion is not applicable.16.3.3.1 The flow rate of purge gas flow should beinterlocked to shut off the silane family gases if thepurge gas flow drops below the amount needed toinsure adequate dilution.16.4 Protection16.4.1 Fire Detection and Suppression16.4.1.1 Use the results of the risk assessmentdescribed in SEMI S14 to determine the need for firedetection and suppression.16.4.1.2 Fire detection and suppression system(s)should be operational at all times, including whenequipment or facilities are shut down or in maintenancemode.EXCEPTION: Maintenance of the fire detection system.16.4.2 As for any other safety design considerationaspect of process equipment, SEMI S2 provides criteriafor assessing and managing safety risks.16.5 Information on Exhaust16.5.1 The equipment supplier should provide exhaustinformation to the user. The information should bebased on the baseline process including: the chemicals and their composition, compatibility requirements and type of connectionexpected at outlet of the vacuum pump, the potential hazards expected if duct is open to airduring the maintenance, recommended maintenance procedures when theequipment is connected to a point-of-use gastreatment system,

&lt;!-- Page 27 --&gt;

SEMI S18-1102 © SEMI 200215  recommended duct size and flow volumes, basedon the suppliers recommended base process, information on potential maintenance issuesassociated with the process (such as silicatedeposits and reactive by-product generation), The probable hazards that would be generated byexposure of open ducts to air during maintenanceactivities, maximum distance from the reaction chamber tothe vacuum pump, and maximum distance from the pump to the exhaustconnection or the point-of-use abatement.16.5.2 The need to route the residual gas and by-products to the proper gas treatment system may requireconsideration of separate pump systems forincompatible gases.16.6 Other Information16.6.1 Manuals as defined in SEMI S13, shouldinclude information and training requirement on silanefamily gases, their hazards, and recommendedprotective measures.16.6.2 Hazard warning labels should be designed inconformance to SEMI S1. Where such labels are to beplaced should be decided per SEMI S2. 17 Exhaust Systems and Plumbing17.1 Design17.1.1 Enclosure Exhaust System  Exhaust piping forthe gas panel enclosure or the pump enclosure may berequired to be separated from heat exhaust line toprevent the possibility for mixing of incompatiblechemistries before dilution.NOTE 50: Separation of exhaust systems may be required bycertain jurisdictions.17.1.1.1 Air velocity for an enclosure should becalculated to minimize collection of silane family gasesinto pockets.NOTE 51: Information to decide what amount of air velocityshould be needed is provided through Related Information 2.Document such as CGA P32-2000 and NFPA318-2000provides similar information.NOTE 52: Some regulations may require minimum velocitiesuntil new research (SSA Journal, Spring and Winter 1998)can be incorporated into the regulations. This minimumvelocity is not less than 1.0 m/sec for the overall enclosure,and air velocity across any potential leakage point is not lessthan 0.5 m/sec.NOTE 53: Recommendations for gas cylinder cabinetexhaust provided in Related Information 2 can also be used for enclosures within process equipment. For the purpose ofenclosure exhaust calculations, gas delivery pressure to theenclosure should be used as the source pressure in Figure 3of Related Information 2.17.1.2 Process Exhaust Systems17.1.2.1 Materials of construction should becompatible with the hazards presented by the silanefamily gases present.17.1.2.2 Materials for exhaust piping containing silanefamily gases should be compatible with the byproductsand should provide protection from heat and reactions,which may be present when silane family gases exit areaction chamber.17.1.2.3 No combustible joint compound (includingadhesive or tape) should be used to seal joints.17.1.2.4 Process exhaust piping should withstand themaximum potential pressure generated by the reactionof respective silane family gases in a reasonablyforeseeable worst case, single-point failure at theprocess equipment.17.1.3 Metal-gasket face-seal fittings should be usedwherever possible. Compression fittings lead toincreased risk of leaks, especially when subjected toexpansion and contraction by internally burning andextinguishing silane family gases.17.2 Protective Devices17.2.1 Mechanical fittings in pressurized exhaust ortreatment system should be enclosed in exhaustedenclosures, like any supply piping. Leaking can becaused by the result of assembly and disassemblyduring pump and treatment system maintenance.17.3 Maintainability17.3.1 Maintenance personnel should inspect forliquids and solids collecting in exhaust ducts to preventaccidents resulting from the build-up of reactionproducts.17.3.2 Ports for chemical sampling should be providedin order to enable inspection of deposits and samplingof gas composition and concentration in the exhaustduct.17.3.2.1 Ports, if not connected to a sampling device,should have a stop valve and should be sealed with acap or plug.17.3.2.2 This monitoring should be performedperiodically to insure gas composition and quantitieshave not generated new hazards and to characterize gasdeposits and ensure they are being removed.17.3.2.3 View ports also require periodic cleaning toprovide for adequate viewing capability. If the gas is

&lt;!-- Page 28 --&gt;

SEMI S18-1102 © SEMI 2002 16 corrosive, these ports should be compatible with thehazards presented.17.3.3 Due to the hazards associated with silane familygas deposits, only maintenance workers trained tohandle the potential for reactions, small fires orexplosions should be allowed to perform maintenanceon exhaust ducts for silane family gases.17.3.3.1 Maintenance management should investigatethe thickness and composition of the deposits andestablish the proper method of maintenance.17.3.3.2 If the investigation indicates the deposit isreactive or unstable, a procedure to stabilize orneutralize the deposit before opening the duct to airshould be implemented.17.3.3.3 Equipment suppliers should also notify usersthat stabilizing or neutralizing procedures provided inthe maintenance manuals might not work for exhaustlines with multiple silane family gas-using systemsattached.17.3.4 The exhaust piping should be designed to have ameans of monitoring the exhaust line for determining ifthe exhaust line is blocked. 18 Exhaust Treatment Systems18.1 Selection18.1.1 Refer to SEMI F5 for techniques andinformation to determine the appropriate abatement(exhaust treatment) system.18.1.2 The user should determine the composition,concentration, absolute amount per minute and possiblephases (solid, liquid or gas) of all chemicals, to betreated, before requesting quotations on abatementsystems. This information is very important to designan appropriate abatement system.18.1.3 The information should be provided for normaloperation and all reasonable foreseeable failures.18.2 Absorbent Systems  Gas leak detection mayalso be needed as breakthrough detection for absorbentsystems. To ensure that each gas treatment systemfunctions properly, it should have a gas detection andalarm system that detects breakthrough of absorbent.The location of sample points should be appropriate todetect breakthrough of the absorbent according to thetreatment system instructions. 18.2.1 When breakthrough is detected, the gas sourcewhich supplies silane family gas or other hazardous gasto the equipment connected to the failed abatementsystem should be shut off. Absorbent in the failedabatement system should be replaced immediately.Alternatively a switching system can be employed toswitch to a back-up absorbent bed or redundanttreatment system.18.3 Design18.3.1 Point-of-use gas abatement systems aredescribed in SEMI F5.18.3.2 A gas abatement system should be selected withconsideration for both equipment and facilities.18.3.3 Some gas abatement systems need enclosures.Such enclosures should be monitored for leaks. Uponleak detection, an alarm should be activated and the gassource should be shut down.18.3.4 When abnormal status of an abatement systemis detected, the gas source(s) which supply gas to theequipment connected to the gas abatement systemshould be stopped.18.3.5 In a combustion-type gas treatment system, aflame detector, an airflow rate sensor, an exhausttemperature monitor and a gas concentration monitor atthe outlet could be used for detecting abnormal status ofthose parameters.18.3.6 If a wet-type gas abatement system is useddownstream of an adsorbent or combustion gastreatment system, it should be designed to preventreverse flow of water into the upstream system.Monitoring to determine any abnormal operatingcondition of the wet-type system should be provided.18.3.6.1 The system should also be equipped with awater leak sensor.18.4 OperationNOTE 54: The concentrations of exhaust gas at the outlet ofa gas abatement system must not exceed the maximumallowable concentrations established by laws and regulationsof the region where the system is used, even in an emergencysituation.18.4.1 Adequate performance of the abatement systemshould be ensured at all times.NOTE 55: Constant monitoring of the concentration at theoutlet may be required by some jurisdictions. The source gasmay also have to be shut down if the emissions reach themaximum allowable amount.NOTE 56: It may not be necessary for abatement systems tobe constantly on-line in some jurisdictions when gas isstored and not dispensed. In such a situation, the

&lt;!-- Page 29 --&gt;

Reprinted with permission from FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheet 7-7Semiconductor Fabrication Facilities R2-2 Explosion PotentialsR2-2.1 Silane Ventilated Enclosure ExampleR2-2.1.1 Consider the case of a ventilated enclosure of 25.9 ft (0.73 m) volume, swept by a ventilation flow of 450scfm (12,744 lpm). Silane is supplied to the enclosure by a 1/4-in. (6.3 mm) (OD) line at a regulated pressure of 50psig (3.4 bar). This line is in turn fed from a source at 1450 psig (100 bar), through a 10-mil restricted flow orifice(RFO), located at a distance of 80 ft (24.4 m) from the ventilated enclosure. Safe operation of the system isdetermined by the evaluation of two conditions: the magnitude of the initial silane inventory in the 1/4-in. (6.3 mm) line relative to the size of the enclosure, and the magnitude of the RFO-controlled flow relative to the ventilation in the enclosure. The first conditiondetermines the severity of a potential ignition transient at flow start-up. The second provides a measure of thepressure development at flow shut-off.R2-2.2 The standard silane inventory in the line is calculated by first determining the volume of the line \[assume0.035 in. (0.9 mm) wall thickness\]: V line =  / 4 (0.25-20.035) 2  80  12 = 24.43 in 3 The silane volume, when expanded to standard conditions, is given by (cf. Eq. 1): Vstd = 24.43  0.0708  50 (1 + 8.19 10 7  50 2 ) = 86.66 in 3 = 0.05 ft 3 The ratio of the volume of the enclosure to the standard volume of silane is: Vencl / Vstd = 25.9 / 0.05 = 518 R2-2.3 Since this value is greater than 100, the situation is acceptable from the point of view of potential pressuretransients caused by ignition of the release at flow startup.R2-2.4 Verifying the second condition requires calculating the RFO-controlled flow. By interpolation of the data inTable 2, the flow through a 10-mil orifice from a source at 1450 psig (100 bar) is estimated to be equal to 2.41 scfm(68.25 lpm). Since the maximum silane flow rate that can be accepted for a ventilation of 450 scfm (12,744 lpm) is1.8 scfm (51 lpm) (450/250, see recommendation 3 above), this situation is not acceptable. It would becomeacceptable if the ventilation flow was increased to 600 scfm (16,992 lpm) (2.41  250) or if the explosion ventingconditions shown in Figures R2-2a and R2-2b were to be satisfied.

These instructions should state thatthe protection depends on the means ofdisconnection remaining in the immediate controlof the personnel performing the work, attempting to restart the equipment or re-energizethe system(s) that is/are to be isolated fromhazardous energy, and verification that there is no hazardous residualenergy in the system.NOTE 9: An example of minimum Hazardous Energy ControlProcedures can be found in 29 CFR 1910.147 Appendix A.NOTE 10: The intent of instructions is to meet the need for avalid verification method that energy is isolated and to ensurethat proper procedures are provided. An instruction is not required if the condition is not present or possible or themethod is not technically feasible. 7 Energy Isolation Device Identification7.1 Each LOTO EID should be uniquely andconsistently identified on the system, drawings,schematics, procedures, etc. to reduce confusion.EXCEPTION: Equipment consisting of a grouping offunctional modules (e.g., a cluster tool), where morethan one module is used in the same grouping, may usethe same identifying numbers in each module.NOTE 11: Where there are multiple control devices such thatone or more operating devices might be confused with theLOTO EID, a differentiation marking may be used to preventconfusion. One example of such a differentiation marking isshown in Related Information 3.7.2 All LOTO EIDs integral to the equipment shouldbe marked on the equipment.7.2.1 LOTO EID markings should be located on theequipment adjacent to (not on) the EIDs they identify.NOTE 12: Marking directly on the EID can mean thatreplacement of the EID will also remove the EID marking.7.2.2 Where the LOTO EID marking is obscured(covered by wiring, tubing, installation hardware, etc.),an additional marking should also be placed on the EIDitself.7.3 For LOTO EIDs required by the supplier butprovided and installed by the user, the supplier shouldspecify the requirements for such devices.7.3.1 When such devices are specified, users shouldprovide lockable EIDs.7.3.2 Users should provide to the supplier, if requested,the location of the device.7.3.3 Utility connection points for which LOTO EIDsare located external to the equipment should be markedto indicate that a user-provided EID is the method ofenergy isolation. Space on the equipment should beprovided for the user to indicate the location of theLOTO EID.7.4 The style and size of letters and numbers on LOTOEID markings should meet the criteria of SEMI S8 inorder to be readable from the normal viewpoint ofaccess to the LOTO EID.7.4.1 The LOTO EID marking (as it appears on theequipment) need not be colored according to Table 1 inSection 9.

Generic LOTOprocedures should also be included where the suppliermaintenance procedures require isolation of thatequipment.NOTE 13: A graphical reference placeholder can be providedby any method that allows space for the user to identify user-installed support equipment and its associated LOTO EIDS(e.g., a blank outlined space, a blank underlined space, anumbered line with space for inserting text).8.3 The size of the LOTO EID identifiers on thegraphical representation of the equipment should belarge enough to indicate the EID in question, but not solarge as to confuse location of the device in relation andorientation to the rest of the equipment.8.4 Each of the LOTO EID physical locations on theequipment should be identified on a graphicalrepresentation of the equipment with an image similarin shape and text to the marking on the equipment.8.5 LOTO EIDs that are not provided by the supplierbut are necessary to complete the associated task safely,as defined by the supplier, should be graphicallyidentified as a generic external device in theprocedures. The procedure should mention that the enduser provides these devices.8.6 For each specific task, the graphical representationshould illustrate at least the portion(s) of equipmentinvolved in the specific maintenance task.EXCEPTION: Graphical representation need not beduplicated for each task, but may be referenced by morethan one instruction.8.6.1 The representation should be easily capable ofbeing associated with the LOTO procedure for the taskbeing completed or include the procedure text in writtenform at the bottom of the graphical representation.8.6.2 Task level instructions should identify thoseLOTO EIDs that are required for the specific task beingcompleted and link them to the graphicalrepresentation. 8.7 Energy isolation instructions for equipment optionsor nonstandard procedures should be provided with theequipment option or nonstandard process change aspurchased from the supplier.NOTE 14: Nonstandard procedures include customer specifictasks such as chamber cleaning for unique chemistries, use ofspecial lifting devices for single customers, and other tasksthat are not part of the standard procedures for the normalsupplier-delivered configuration.8.7.1 The graphical representations should capture theoptions LOTO EID in the representation for the overalltask it affects (e.g., if a UPS is offered as an option, theLOTO procedures for the UPS option should beprovided and the UPS LOTO EID included in thegraphical representation). 9 Graphical Reference Guides for use at theEquipmentNOTE 15: Graphical reference guides are intended to make iteasy for personnel to locate and isolate sources of hazardousenergy associated with the tasks they are performing.9.1 Graphical reference guides should be provided foreach task where LOTO is used. LOTO EIDs should begraphically identified on these reference guides.Instructions for controlling each source of energy asoutlined in Section 6.1.2 should also be provided on thereference guides. The reference guides should be taskspecific.NOTE 16: See Related Information 1 for example.EXCEPTION: A single graphical reference guide maybe used for more than one task, provided it can beeasily determined from the text instructions, whichLOTO EIDs are used for each task.9.2 It is recommended that the graphical referenceguides include a color representation of the overallequipment, as well as individual task-specificrepresentations, as they would be found in themaintenance manual.EXCEPTION: If manuals are printed only in black andwhite, the color representation may be specified asprinted by the user from the electronic copy.9.3 If the supplier has no standard for coloring theindicators of the LOTO EID locations on graphicalrepresentations, they should be colored according to thetype of energy being isolated. See Table 1,Recommended Identifying Color Matrix.
