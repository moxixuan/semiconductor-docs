SEMI P24-94 (Reapproved 1104)
CD METROLOGY PROCEDURES
This  standard  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Micropatterning  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Micropatterning  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  July  11,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  September
2004; to be published November 2004.  Originally published in 1994.
1  Purpose
1. 1  The   purpose   of   this   document   is   to   establish
uniform procedures for metrology systems for the litho-
metrology task.  It does not address how these systems
will  be  applied  to  solve  problems,  nor  does  it  address
other contributors to process variations such as thermal
wafer    processing,    exposure    tool    focus    control,
materials, etc.
1. 2  Background  —  Fundamental  to  manufacturing  is
the  gauging  or  measurement  process.    It  is  required
initially  to  develop  a  usable  manufacturing  capability
and  then  to  verify  that  what  is  being  manufactured
conforms to specification/expectation.
2  Scope
2. 1  This     document     discusses     determining     the
performance  of  gauging/measurement  systems  for  a
very  specific  application  —  the  lithography  section  of
integrated  circuit  wafer  fabrication.    This  document  in
many  cases,  will  be  applicable  to  IC  mask-making,  in
which  case  the  word  “mask”  can  be  substituted  for
“wafer.”
2. 2  It is acknowledged that the final measurement for a
fabricated    wafer    is    the    electrical    functionality.
However,  the  intermediate  lithographic  measurements
can   be   useful   in   prediction   and   control   of   final
functionality.    This  document  is  intended  to  be  useful
for  this  litho-metrology  application,  irrespective  of  the
technology employed.
2. 3  Measurement   results   and   system   performance
depend on the sample(s) used.  Therefore, performance
for  different  systems  or  the  same  system  at  different
times  can  only  be  appropriately  compared  when  the
measurements  are  obtained  with  a  sample  of  the  same
material composition.
2. 4  The  parameter  addressed  is  precision.    Additional
important  parameters  are  reliability  and  cleanliness,
which have been addressed by other SEMI standards.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

5  Terminology
5. 1  Definitions
5. 1.1  precision — the degree of agreement of repeated
measurements    of    the    same    parameter    expressed
quantitatively as the standard deviation, computed from
the  results  of  a  series  of  controlled  determinations
[ASTM D 1129, D-29].
5. 1.2  A  frequency  plot  of  measurements  taken  with
random   error   illustrates   precision.      The   spread   or
variation  of  measurement  in  test  A  is  smaller  than  that
in test B.  The results of test A are more precise than the
results from test B. See Figure 1.
NOTE 2:  Any   test   procedure   used   needs   to   differentiate
between system and wafer contribution.

5. 1.3  repeatability  —  the  standard  deviation  of  results
obtained   by   the   same   operator   using   the   same
instrument  in  successive  measurements  [ASTM  C  609,
C-21].  The same system parameters need to be used.
The degree to which the individual operator affects the
measured  result  is  a  critical  parameter  and  must  be
identified and benchmarked.
NOTE 3:  The degree to which the individual operator affects
the  measured  result  may  be  a  critical  parameter  and  must  be
identified.
5. 1.4  reproducibility  —  the  precision  of  a  test  method
expressed  in  terms  of  agreement  expected  between
measurements   made   in   different   laboratories   using
similar  apparatus  and  the  same  procedure  [ASTM  D
4790, D-16].
5. 1.5  stability  —  the  standard  deviation  of  means  of
groups  of  measurements  taken  at  specified  intervals
over an extended period of time.
NOTE 4:  The   means   are   used   to   avoid   including   the
measurement  precision.  Stability  is  a  characterization  of  the
system independent of precision. It is important to use a stable
sample so that system stability, independent of the sample, is
determined.
5. 1.6  standard deviation — a measure of the dispersion
of a series of results around their average, expressed as
the  square  root  of  the  quantity,  obtained  by  adding  the
squares of the deviations from the average of the results
and dividing by the number of observations minus one.
It  is  also  the  square  root  of  the  variance  and  can  be
calculated as follows:
s=
x
i
− x ()
2
∑
n−1
1()

Where:
s = estimated standard deviation of the series of results
X
i
= each individual value
X= average (arithmetic mean) of all values, and
n = number of values
The   following   forms   of   this   equation   are   more
convenient  for  computation,  especially  when  using  a
calculator:
s=
x
2
−x
∑

∑

or
s=

−x
∑

∑

where:
s           =           estimated           standard           deviation
x
2
=
sum of the squares of all the individual values
∑
x
∑
()
2
=
square of the total of the individual values,
and
n = number of values

NOTE 5:  Care   must   be   taken   in   using   either   of   these
equations that a sufficient number of decimal places is carried
in the sum of the values and in the sum of their square so that
serious  rounding  errors  do  not  occur.    For  best  results,  all
rounding  should  be  postponed  until  after  a  value  has  been
obtained for s [ASTM E 180, E 15].

6  Procedures to Benchmark Precision
6. 1  Precision Types
6. 1.1  Static  Precision  —  A  series  of  measurements
made  of  a  single  feature  where,  for  each  measurement,
the  information  is  reacquired  and  reprocessed.    The
minimal     intervention     required     to     repeat     the
measurement will be used.  The standard deviation will
be calculated based on the sample data.
6. 1.2  Z  (Axis  Adjustment)  Precision  —  A  series  of
measurements  is  made  of  a  single  feature  where  it  is
necessary to refocus before each measurement (without
intentional  movement  in  the  x  and  y  axes  before  each
measurement).        The    standard    deviation    will    be
calculated based on the sample data.
6. 1.2.1  Dynamic  Precision  —  Make  one  measurement
of grouped line and space features at n number of sites
on   a   focus/exposure   matrix   wafer,   which   includes
typical size and side wall angle variations.  Remove the
wafer  from  the  system,  then  reload  and  remeasure.
Compute  the  dynamic  precision,  3s,  by  the  double
sample method (see Section 8.1.3).
6. 1.2.1.1  A  total  of  1  size  ×  n  sites  ×  2  repeates  =  2n
measure-ments    per    wafer    ×    3    passes    =    6n
measurements required.
6. 1.2.1.2  10 is a minimum recommended value for n.
6. 1.2.1.3  This   may   also   be   redone   for   different
thicknesses  of  lines  to  be  measured  and  repeated  for
each of the wafer types in the process.
7  Precision Test
7. 1  Test Methods
7. 1.1  Stability  Test  Method  —  Makes  a  group  of  five
measurements   of   a   stable   feature,   such   as   etched
polysilicon,  at  the  same  position,  daily.    Any  system
adjustment,   maintenance,   environment   variation   is
allowed,  but  noted.    Recalibration  is  optional,  but  is
noted.    Use  a  feature  which  doesn’t  change  over  time,
or with repeated measurements.  Plot the daily averages
on an individual control chart with control limits based
on the moving range of the daily averages.
7. 1.2  Sequence Test Method — A series or sequence of
measurements  is  taken  of  the  same  physical  location.
Any change between measurements determines the type
of precision tested.
7. 1.3  Double     Sample     Test     Method     —     Two
measurements are taken at separate times within the test
run  at  a  number  of  different  physical  locations.    A
series  of  sites  is  used  which  have:  same  nominal  size,
same  proximity  of  other  features,  similar  side  wall
angle, etc.
7. 2  Test Duration
7. 2.1  Short Term — No system calibration, adjustment,
or  maintenance  will  be  done.    The  period  should  be
short  enough  to  minimize  the  effect  of  environmental
variations.  See R1-1.
7. 2.2  Long    Term    —    Any    system    adjustments,
maintenance,  environment  variation  is  allowed.    See
R1-2.  Recalibration is optional.
7. 2.3  Presentation  of  Results  —  Some  information,
relative  to  the  data,  must  be  included  to  qualify  the
results.      Graphical   representation   of   the   data   is
recommended.
7. 2.3.1  The following must be included:
• The estimated (1, 2, or 3) standard deviation(s),
• Short or Long Term
• Confidence interval (see Application Note A.3)
• The number of measurements or sample size (n)
• Describe the feature film and substrate film
• Nominal or average measurement
• Feature  Type:  line  or  space  or  hole,  grouped  or
isolated
• The frequency of recalibration
• Test identified as the type performed
7. 2.3.1.1  Additional  information  which  should  also  be
included, particularly with unusual conditions, are:
• Metric  units  are  recommended,  such  as  nanometer
[nm] or micrometer [μm]
• Feature  characteristics,  such  as:  sidewall  angle,
wall  profile,  corner  radius,  materials,  thickness,
index of refraction, edge waviness, edge roughness
• Duration of the test
• The sample frequency
• Significant  parameters  such  as  operator,  system
model,   serial   number,   pertinent   environmental
conditions, etc.

R1-1  Short Term Test Duration
R1-1.1  It  is  recommended  the  short  term  test  duration
be  30  measurements  done  in  the  shortest  possible  time
under   the   most   limited   of   conditions   to   eliminate
extraneous sources of variation.
R1-2  Long Term Duration
R1-2.1  Common  practice  requires  about  30  degrees  of
freedom  in  the  highest  level  of  sources  of  variation.
For  example,  one  should  continue  a  long  term  study
over  30  working  days,  if  days  is  the  highest  level  of
variation.

SPECIFICATION FOR MEASURING DEPTH OF FOCUS AND BEST
FOCUS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Micropatterning  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Microlithography  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  16,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org
September 2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published in 1994.
1  Purpose
1. 1  This   document   provides   a   common   descriptive
vocabulary  and  outline  of  basic  technique  for  use  by
photolithographers  in  the  IC  industry  to  gauge  and
report   the   depth   of   focus,   astigmatism,   and   field
curvature  of  IC  photolithographic  instruments  (e.g.,
scanners,     steppers).     [Hereafter     referred     to     as
“instrument” or “instruments.”]
2  Scope
2. 1  This specification is limited to the measurement of
focus  and  depth  of  focus  for  photolithography  as  used
in  the  manufacture  of  integrated  circuits  and  closely
allied  technologies.  Because  of  the  wide  variation  in
equipment  techniques,  it  is  not  possible  to  provide  a
definitive measurement procedure for these parameters.
Rather, in this document, a basic guideline is offered.
NOTE 1:  This  technique  has  value  in  determining  the  best
focus  setting  for  a  given  application,  however  the  main
concern  will  be  the  determination  for  the  depth  of  focus,
astigmatism and field curvature for the purpose of comparing
different instruments and processes.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  It  must  be  emphasized  that  the  values  of  depth  of
focus,   astigmatism,   and   field   curvature   cannot   be
determined  for  a  given  instrument  independent  of  the
effects  of  the  image  geometries  and  the  image  transfer
process.  The  values  will  have  to  be  determined  under
the   constraints   of   a   practical   application   process,
suitable for the instrument, illumination, process, object
pattern,  and  environment.  Thus,  the  process  to  be  used
for  a  fair  measure  of  instrument  performance  must  be
one  that  is  appropriate  and  has  been  optimized  for  the
given  instrument  and  application.  Comparison  of  the
performance    of    two    different    instruments    will
inherently  be  a  comparison  of  the  the  total  application,
instrument specific processes included. A description of
the  process  is  a  necessary  part  of  the  report  of  a  depth
of  focus,  astigmatism  or  field  curvature  measurement.
Relying    on    values    that    were    obtained    under
significantly  different  application  conditions  from  the
desired  application  will  result  in  error  and  potential
unexpected process failure.

5  Terminology
5. 1  Definitions
NOTE 2:  The  scope  of  the  following  definitions  does  not
necessarily   cover   application   outside   of   the   procedures
discussed    herein.    For    more    universal    definitions    and
discussion,  the  user  is  referred  to  any  of  the  standard  optical
texts.
5. 1.1  image (micropatterning) — any single geometric
form appearing in a layout: (1) drafting — as a part of a
master drawing or layout; (2) optical — as projected on
a  screen  or  viewed,  usually  at  some  magnification  or
reduction;  (3)  oxide  —  as  etched  in  the  silicon  dioxide
layer on an oxidized silicon wafer; (4) photographic —
as in a photomask or in the emulsion of a photographic
film  or  plate;  (5)  as  a  photoresist,  an  exposed  and
developed coating on a substrate.
5. 1.2  processed image (micropatterning) — any single
geometric  form  appearing  in  the  realized  pattern  or
topographical variation in a material surface or material
constitution,  obtained  by  a  physical  process  of  pattern
transference from an optical image.
NOTE 3:  This definition is intended to extend the discussion
of  depth  of  focus  and  focus  to  include  both  cases  where  the
images   are   realized   in   photoresist   films,   per   the   image
definition given above, and cases where there may not in fact
be   a   photoresist   film   involved   in   the   optical   pattern
transference  process.  Examples  include  photoactive  chemical
vapor deposition and photo ablation.


SEMI P25-94 © SEMI 1994, 2004 2
5. 1.3  standard  coordinates  —  a  system  of  Cartesian
coordinates with the z axis along the optical axis of the
system  and  with  the  x  and  y  axes  in  the  flat  plane
perpendicular to the optical axis. The system user or the
supplier will specify the x and y directions in this plane
for any particular equipment studies.
NOTE 4:  Upon   occasion,   cylindrical   coordinates   may   be
used    for    special    discussions,    for    example,    mapping
astigmatism.  The  standard  transform  is  used  between  the
Cartesian (x,y) and the cylindrical (r,ø) is used.
NOTE 5:  The x and y coordinates are taken as displacements
from  the  optical  axis  along  a  flat  plane.  Thus,  if  the  image
plane  is  curved,  the  x  and  y  coordinates  are  taken  from  the
projection  of  the  curved  image  plane  onto  a  flat  plane.
Consistently,  r  is  taken  as  the  distance  along  a  perpendicular
to the optical axis.
NOTE 6:  A  displacement  along  the  z  axis  (and  hence  the
optical  axis)  from  a  reference  position  will  be  negative  for
displacements  toward  midpoint  of  the  optical  system  and
positive  for  displacements  away  from  the  midpoint  of  the
optical system, regardless of whether the reference position is
on  the  object  side  or  on  the  image  side  or  coincident  with
some portion of the optical system.
NOTE 7:  For folded optical systems, the coordinate system is
allowed  to  rotate  with  position  along  the  optical  axis  so  that
the  above  definition  holds  at  any  given  position  along  the
axis. Alternately, it may be assumed that for purposes of using
this  coordinate  system,  all  optical  paths  are  represented  as
unfolded.
5. 1.4  image field — the extent of the image along the x
and  y  axes.  It  may  be  defined  by  the  limits  of  image
quality,    as    a    practical    matter,    for    the    intended
application.
NOTE 8:  Definitions  5.1.1  and  5.1..2  in  combination  with
5. 1.4  define  the  drafting  image  field,  the  optical  image  field,
the  processed  image  field,  etc.  The  term  “image”  refers  to  a
single   geometrical   form.   The   term   “field”   refers   to   the
complete set of forms.
5. 1.5  practical  use  —  the  conditions  of  photoprocess,
image geometries, etc. that are required for the intended
use  of  the  instrument.  The  practical  use  is  specified  by
the following:
• process    —    photoresist    type    and    chemical
processing,         exposure         conditions,         and
environmental      conditions      (temperature      and
humidty setpoints and stability).
• pattern   —   description   or   diagram   of   the   test
structures,    including    the    choice    geometrical
dimensions, orientations, positions.
• substrate      —      the      substrate      quality      and
specifications,  including  all  pre-existing  structures
and layers on the substrate.
• leveling  —  the  leveling  mechanism  used  to  hold
the substrate at the desired position and angle with
respect to the optical image plane.
• site  —  list  or  map  of  the  image  sites  in  the
processed image field used for the tests.
• criteria   —   the   acceptance   criteria   used   in   the
evaluation of the processed images.
NOTE 9:  Typically,  the  instrument  vendor  will  indicate  a
range of practical use parameters and the instrument user will
select  from  this  range  the  actual  conditions,  as  is  appropriate
to the user’s needs.
5. 1.6  resolution,  practical  —  the  minimum  line  width
that   reproduces   the   mask   (or   drafting)   dimensions
faithfully.   [SEMI   Micropatterning   —   Terms   and
Definitions Relating to the Microlithography Industry]
NOTE 10:  The  practical  resolution  is  a  number  specified  by
the equipment vendor.
5. 1.7  point-like  object  —  A  circular  or  square  form  in
the  image  where  the  diameter  or  width  is  equal  to  the
practical resolution.
5. 1.8  evaluative line pattern — A pattern in the image
constructed  of  3  to  5  straight  parallel  lines  where  the
lines  are  oriented  at  some  specified  angle  with  respect
to  the  standard  coordinates  and  where  the  width  of  the
lines is equal to the practical resolution and the pitch of
the  lines  is  twice  the  practical  resolution.  (See  SEMI
P19.)
5. 1.9  saggital lines — An evaluative line pattern where
the  lines  lie  along  a  radius  to  the  optical  axis.  (See
Figure 1.)
NOTE 11:  Saggital lines are primarily formed from light rays
that do not lie in planes containing the optical axis. For optical
systems having cylindrical symmetry, such as some reduction
steppers,  the  saggital  lines  will  be  radial  lines  from  some
particular point of the image field. For other systems the lines
may  not  be  radial.  For  example,  the  saggital  direction  for
scanners   is   perpendicular   to   the   direction   of   the   scan
throughout the image field.
5. 1.10  tangential  lines  —  An  evaluative  line  pattern
where  the  lines  lie  perpendicular  to  a  radius  to  the
optical axis. (See Figure 1.)
NOTE 12:  Tangential  lines  are  primarily  formed  from  light
rays  that  do  lie  in  planes  containing  the  optical  axis.  For
systems having cylindrical symmetry, tangential lines lie upon
circles  about  some  particular  point  of  the  image  field.  For
other systems, the lines may not be so arranged. For example,
the tangential direction for scanners is parallel to the direction
of the scan throughout the image field.
5. 1.11  focus — a condition of geometric adjustment of
the lens’s object, the optical system and the image plane
such  that  the  optical  image  rays  originating  from  a
given  point  in  the  object  converge  to  the  smallest


SEMI P25-94 © SEMI 1994, 2004 3
possible  area  at  the  corresponding  point  in  the  optical
image.  It  is  always  given  as  a  numerical  displacement
of  the  optical  image  point  along  the  optical  axis  from
some arbitrary reference such as an optical exit surface,
optical  center,  conjugate  plane,  etc.  Focus  may  vary
across the image field and is properly given as a  z axis
value for a specified image site in the image field. (See
the definition for Focal Surface.)
NOTE 13:  Point-like  objects  will  have  the  sharpest  optical
image  at  this  z-axis  position.  The  z-axis  position  for  the
sharpest  processed  image  of  point-like  objects  will  usually
have a constant offset from the z-axis position for the sharpest
optical  image  for  point-like  objects.  (See  “mean  focus”  and
“best focus” definitions that follow in the text.)
NOTE 14:  This  is  also  the  position  which  yields  the  highest
contrast  in  the  photon  flux  at  the  given  point  in  the  optical
image.
5. 1.12  line  focus  —  the  z  axis  position  where  for
evaluative lines in the image, the optical image has the
highest  contrast  and  the  evaluative  line  pattern  will
consequently  appear  with  the  correct  width  and  pitch.
Line  focus  may  vary  across  the  image  field  and  is
properly  given  as  a  z  axis  value  for  a  specified  image
site in the image field. It also varies with the line angle,
and    the    line    focus    must,    therefore,    include    a
specification  of  the  angle  (e.g.,  saggital,  tangential,  or
some other angle).
5. 1.13  focal   surface   —   the   surface   determined   by
finding  the  focus  for  each  point-like  object  in  the
optical image field, with the object fixed with respect to
the  lens.  The  focal  surface  is  then  the  map  of  z  axis
displacements  for  the  highest  contrast  at  each  point  in
the optical image field as a function of the (x,y) or (r,
ø)
coordinates.
NOTE 15:  It  is  important  to  remember  that  the  unqualified
focal  surface  is  determined  using  point-like  objects,  not  lines
or  gratings.  Separate  determinations  must  be  made  for  non-
point-like objects.
5. 1.14  field   flatness   —   the   difference   between   the
maximum  and  the  minimum  z  axis  positions  over  the
focal surface.
5. 1.15  saggital   focal   surface   —   the   focal   surface
determined by examining only saggital lines.
5. 1.16  tangential  focal  surface  —  the  focal  surface
determined by examining only the tangential lines.
5. 1.17  normal  astigmatism  —  the  difference  in  z  axis
position  at  each  image  site  between  the  saggital  focal
surface and the tangential focal surface. Astigmatism is
a map of scalar values over the (x,y) coordinates of the
image field.
5. 1.18  rotated astigmatism — at each image site, the z
axis difference for the line focus of  two evaluative line
sets,  oriented  at  right  angles  to  each  other  and  at  some
specified  angle  to  the  coordinate  system,  where  the
specified  angle  is  selected  so  that  the  z  axis  focus
difference  is  a  maximum  at  the  given  image  site.  The
specified angle may vary from image site to image site.
NOTE 16:  This  is  called  “rotated”  astigmatism  because  the
specified  angle  is  not  necessarily  the  saggital  or  tangential
direction.
5. 1.19  mean  focus  —  the  z  axis  position  representing
the  area  average  focal  surface  for  point-like  objects  in
the optical image.
5. 1.20  best  focus  —  a  position  of  the  processed  image
surface  such  that  the  best  compromise  of  focus  across
the   whole   of   the   processed   image   is   obtained,   as
defined   by   the   application   requirements   upon   the
processed  image.  The  best  focus  is  a  single  numerical
value  for  the  processed  image  surface  displacement.
The  best  compromise  may  be  such  as  to  optimize  the
possible  defocus  range  or  may  optimize  the  line  width
variations  or  may  minimize  the  deviation  from  some
target  width  or  may  relate  to  some  other  processed
image parameter.
NOTE 17:  Because  of  processing  effects,  this  may  or  may
not  correspond  to  an  optical  conjugate  plane  coincident  with
the photoresist film or other processed layer — top, middle, or
bottom.
NOTE 18:  Because    the    processed    image    surface    will
generally have a curvature that is not adjustable, it is not usual
for the processed image surface to fully correspond to any of
the  focal  surfaces.  Focal  surfaces  are  defined  by  determining
the  z-axis  position  for  a  given  focus  condition,  as  a  function
of the image position. A processed image surface is therefore
set at a z axis position that provides the best compliance to the
focal surface.
5. 1.21  defocus  —  the  distance,  perpendicular  to  the
image  plane,  between  the  processed  image  plane  and
the plane of best focus.
NOTE 19:  A  defocus  of  zero  is  the  best  focus  position,  a
positive  defocus  places  the  optical  image  plane  further  from
the  lens,  a  negative  defocus  places  the  optical  image  plane
closer to the lens.
5. 1.22  focal  range  —  depth  of  focus  —  the  total
distance   of   defocus   where   over   the   whole   of   the
processed    image    field,    the    processed    image    is
sufficiently resolved for practical use.
5. 1.23  depth  of  focus  map  —  a  plot,  for  each  position
in the image field, of the greatest defocus in the positive
direction   and   the   greatest   defocus   in   the   negative
direction,  where  the  processed  image  is  sufficiently
resolved for practical use.
NOTE 20:  As  stated  previously,  the  focal  range  or  the  depth
of  focus  are  dependent  on  the  process,  upon  the  image
geometries   (especially   the   line   width),   and   upon   the


SEMI P25-94 © SEMI 1994, 2004 4
permissible  deviations.  The  depth  of  focus  maps  may  be
dependant,  among  other  things,  on  the  process,  line  width,
and   image   geometry,   especially   the   choice   of   point-like
patterns  or  line-like  patterns  along  the  saggital,  tangential,  or
other  directions.  Several  maps  may  be  produced  as  part  of  a
test, covering these variations.
6  Procedure
6. 1  Pattern  —  See  SEMI  P19.  A  pattern  and  pattern
dimensions  are  to  be  selected  in  accordance  with  the
most    reasonable    correspondence    to    the    intended
application of the equipment. Typically, the pattern will
consist  of  two  sets  of  evaluative  lines.  A  sequence  of
patterns  of  varying  line  widths  may  also  be  employed,
in  which  case  the  depth  of  focus  may  be  reported  as  a
function  of  the  line  width.  The  pattern  selection  and
dimensions must be included as part of the report.
6. 2  Test  Sites  —  The  pattern  is  to  be  repeated  at  least
nine  times  over  the  image  field.  The  minimum  of  nine
sites will include the four corners of the image, the four
edge midpoints of the image field and the center of the
image  field.  Whichever  many  sites  are  used,  the  sites
must be distributed symmetrical and uniformly over the
image  field,  giving  no  special  weight  to  any  portion  of
the image field. For examples, see Figure 2.
6. 3  Process  —  A  test  image  will  be  printed  under  the
same   conditions   and   processes   to   be   used   in   the
practical  application  (see  Section  2)  of  the  instrument
(stepper, scanner, etc.). The process description will be
included in the depth of focus and best focus report.
6. 4  Focus  Steps  —  The  image  will  be  printed  several
times,  varying  the  defocus  by  a  fixed  amount  between
each print. The amount of variation of defocus between
steps and the limits of the defocus will be selected so as
to bracket the expected best focus position and to reach
beyond the depth of focus at the extremes of the image
series,  as  best  as  can  be  determined.  The  number  and
size of the defocus steps must be specified in the report.
6. 5  Image  Array  —  These  multiple  images  can  be  a
row   of   separate   exposure   fields   on   one   substrate,
multiple   stepped   displaced   exposures   of   the   test
geometry   within   one   image   field   region,   or   even
exposures on entirely separate substrates. The particular
strategy  is  usually  constrained  by  the  functions  of  the
instrument under test.
6. 6  Test Measurements — For each image site for both
test  pattern  orientations  and  at  each  value  of  defocus,
the  processed  image  geometries  will  be  examined  and
either   accepted   or   rejected   on   the   basis   of   image
sharpness,    image    size    or    some    related    image
characteristic. Usually this examination will use the line
width as the acceptance criteria. The total number of the
measurements  will  be  twice  the  number  of  sites  times
the number of defocus steps.
6. 7  Quantitative  Image  Evaluation  —  The  photoresist
image   patterns   will   be   examined   or   measured   for
deviation  from  the  target,  in  a  manner  specified  by  the
vendor  or  user  of  the  instrument.  An  acceptable  image
is  where  the  variation  of  the  pattern  is  not  outside  the
permissible   deviation   under   the   conditions   of   the
intended  use  of  the  equipment.  The  defocus  values  for
which  the  image  is  usable  will  be  determined  at  each
image site within the image field.
6. 8  Depth  of  Focus  and  Best  Focus  Determination  —
The  defocus  variation  over  which  there  are  usable
images at simultaneously every test site within the field,
by  the  above  criteria,  will  be  reported  as  the  practical
focal  range.  In  accordance  with  the  definition,  the  best
focus  will  be  the  z  axis  position  where  some  target
specification   is   met   or   the   possible   defocus   is
maximized or the line deviation minimized, etc. If there
is no common range of usable defocus across the field,
the   depth   of   focus   is   zero   and   the   best   focus   is
undetermined.  This  can  occur  due  to,  among  other
things, a large plane tilt of substrate to the optical axis,
high   aerial   image   focus   surface   curvature,   high
astigmatism, and auto focus system instabilities.
6. 9  Focal   Astigmatism   Determination   —   The   test
measurements are separated into two groups, one group
for each of the two different orthogonal orientations of
the test pattern. These groups are referred to as the “S”
and  “T”  groups,  however  the  saggital  and  tangential
orientations    have    not    necessarily    been    used    in
accordance with the definition of “rotated astigmatism.”
6. 9.1  For  each  group  separately,  the  focal  surface  is
determined  by  using  for  each  site  the  midpoint  of  the
defocus  values  where  the  processed  image  is  found  to
be acceptable, in accordance with Section 6.7.
6. 9.2  The   difference   in   z   position   between   these
surfaces   for   each   image   site   is   calculated.   These
differences  are  plotted  as  a  function  of  image  position.
This map of values is the astigmatism.
6. 9.3  The   maximum   of   the   absolute   values   is   the
maximum astigmatism.
6. 9.4  The  average  of  the  absolute  values  is  the  mean
astigmatism.
6. 10  Field  Flatness  Determination  —  Two  alternative
but  essentially  equivalent  methods  of  determining  the
focal surface are allowed:
a.   The focal surface which is the midpoint of the S and
T focal surfaces is calculated.


SEMI P25-94 © SEMI 1994, 2004 5
b.   Alternatively,   if   point-like  objects  are  available  in
the  image  for  evaluation,  the  focal  surface  may  be
obtained  by  finding  the  z  displacement  for  the  best
processed point image at each image site.
6. 10.1  This  focal  surface  is  reported  as  a  map  of  z
displacements  as  a  function  of  image  position.  This
map is the curvature of field.
6. 10.2  The    difference    between    the    minimum    z
displacement  in  the  focal  surface  and  the  maximum  z
displacement   in   the   focal   surface   is   the   maximum
curvature of field.
NOTE 21:  This   includes   optical   image   curvature,   wafer
curvature,  fixture  curvature,  etc.  This  procedure  for  the  sake
of  simplicity  does  not  separate  these  effects.  It  is  an  error  to
consider this measure of field flatness equivalent to a measure
of the optical image focal surface.
7  Report
7. 1  The  depth  of  focus,  best  focus,  etc.  reports  will
include a description of the practical use, per definition
5. 1.5. In addition, the report should include mention of
any  special  mechanical  considerations  —  in  particular,

leveling scheme is used and whether this scheme is site
by site or global.

PARAMETER CHECKLIST FOR RESIST THICKNESS MEASUREMENT
ON A SUBSTRATE
This  checklist  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Micropatterning  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  Japanese  Micropatterning  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  Japanese
Regional  Standards  Committee  on  April  28,  2003.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  June  2003;  to  be
published July 2003. Originally published in 1996.
1  Purpose
1. 1    This  checklist  identifies  the  parameters  for  the
thickness   measurement   of   single   layer   resist   on   a
substrate.  Several methods are known for the thickness
measurement  of  thin  films,  among  them  two  methods
are widely used for the thickness measurement of resist
films.
1. 2      They   are   the   surface   profilemeters   which   use
mechanical  contact  method  to  detect  the  topology  of  a
surface, and the light interference method which can be
used only for transparent films.
1. 3    The  contacting  method  has  more  accuracy  than
light   interference   method,   but   the   precision   of   the
measurement  is  limited.    The  light  interference  method
shows  much  more  precision  than  the  other  but  the
results depend on measuring conditions.
2  Scope
2. 1    This  guideline  describes  on  the  parameters  for  the
thickness    measurement    of    single    layer    resist    in
lithography process.
2. 2          For     example,     pre-expose     resist     thickness
measurement  on  a  bare  silicon  wafer  for  the  QC  of  an
optical  resist,  or  the  resist  thickness  measurement  of
partially    exposed    and    fully    exposed    films    after
development  for  the  determination  of  a  characteristic
curve of a resist.

SPECIFICATION FOR OVERLAY-METROLOGY TEST PATTERNS FOR
INTEGRATED-CIRCUIT MANUFACTURE
1  Purpose
1. 1    This  document  defines  several  standard  overlay-
metrology    patterns    that    are    used    by    metrology
equipment  users  to  evaluate  and  test  micropatterning
equipment   and   processes   in   integrated   circuit   (IC)
manufacturing.  These  overlay  cells  may  be  placed  by
optional  patterning  methods  onto  substrates  during  the
manufacturing  process.  Usage  of  the  standard  overlay
patterns     is     an     attempt     to     provide     consistent
industrywide use of automated metrology equipment.
2  Scope
2. 1    This  specification  defines  general  designs  that
describe  the  shape,  size,  design  rules,  and  placement
considerations   (where   appropriate)   of   several   basic
patterns  for  overlay  metrology.  These  standard  test
patterns  can  be  used  for  optical,  scanning  electron
beam, and other types of metrology.
3  Limitations
3. 1    The  patterns  described  in  this  document  represent
the  first  pass  at  an  industrywide  commonality  for  the
purpose   of   compatibility   among   various   types   of
automated  metrology  equipment.  It  is  not  suggested,
however,  that  these  test  patterns  are  a  full  complement
or  are  optimal  for  all  overlay-metrology  applications.
This  document  does  not  attempt  to  specify  how  the
patterns are to be imaged or measured on the substrate.

semiconductor  devices  or  circuits.  [ASTM  F  1241-89]
NOTE:  The  meaning  of  substrate  is  not  limited  to
wafers.
6  General Specification
6. 1  Introduction
6. 1.1    This   specification   describes   th e   overlay   test
patterns  that  are  illustrated  in  the  figures  at  the  end  of
this  document.  The  imaging  means  by  which  these  test
patterns are defined on the substrate may be selected by
the user (see 6.2.1).
6. 1.2
Characteristics  of  the  overlay  p atterns,  such  as
materials,  topography,  polarity,  and  method  of  pattern
transfer  will  be  defined  by  the  user  unless  otherwise
noted.  When  reporting  measurements  extracted  from
these  overlay  test  patterns,  the  user  should  state  the

SEMI P28-96 © SEMI 19962
physical  conditions  (e.g.,  photoresist  island  on  metal
over  an  oxide  window).  The  user  should  further  state
which  features  constitute  the  substrate  geometry  and
which  constitute  the  overlaying  pattern  (terms  as  used
in  the  definition  of  overlay  in  5.4).  In  general,  the
vectors  P1  and  P2  terminate  at  the  geometrical  centers
of   the   substrate   pattern   and   the   overlaying   pattern
respectively.
6. 2
Applications
6. 2.1  The overlay test patterns are in tended to be used
in  a  variety  of  applications.  The  following  applications
list shows some uses for the overlay test patterns.
• Primary Pattern Generation
• Lithography         &         Metrology         Equipment
Characterization
• In-Line Process Overlay Monitoring
• Manufacturing Characterization
• Process Transfer Between Manufacturing Sites
6. 3
Guidelines
6. 3.1    The   overlay   test   patterns   descr ibed   herein
represent  a  basic  metrology  set  from  which  composite
patterns may be constructed.
6. 3.2
Each  overlay  test  pattern  has  a   fundamental
design.    The    user    may    adjust    the    dimensions
appropriately   as   they   apply   to   the   user’s   specific
processing/equipment situations.
6. 3.3
It  is  required  that  labels,  borde r  lines,  indicator
marks,  or  any  other  adjacent  features  be  avoided,  or  at
least  separated  by  a  minimum  of  ten  (10)  micrometers
from   the   overlay   cell.   This   proximity   guideline   is
defined  to  remind  the  user  that  patterns  intended  to  be
independent     and     symmetric     be     designed     as
circumstances permit. The user should determine actual
spacing values, because spacing may be level-, process-
, and/or tool-dependent.
6. 3.4
It  is  recognized  that  there  are  d esign  limitations
dictated   by   the   equipment   and   processes   used   to
generate  the  pattern  (e.g.,  computer  aided  graphics
(CAD)  grids,  pattern  generation  (PG)  rectangles,  E-
beam spot sizes). The user may modify the overlay test
patterns  in  order  to  meet  equipment  limitations  (e.g.,
stay on grid) provided that the resulting patterns or their
representations   retain   the   designed   structures   and
symmetry.
7  Detailed Specification
7. 1  Introduction
7. 1.1   The  figures  provided  within  th is  document  are
intended  to  illustrate  sample  layouts  of  several  overlay
test patterns, and to define appropriate design elements
used  within  each.  The  overlay  test  pattern  dimensions
are provided when appropriate. It is understood that, to
optimize  the  test  pattern’s  performance  in  a  specific
application, the user may deviate beyond this standard.
7. 2
Specific Overlay Patterns — A ll patterns have 90°
rotational symmetry.
7. 2.1
Box-in-Box (see Figure 1)
7. 2.1.1  The box-in-box test pattern is  designed to be a
test  pattern  for  overlay  measurement  on  metrology
equipment.   This   is   the   simplest   possible   design
presented.
7. 2.1.2
The  box-in-box  test  pattern  co nsists  of  two
square  features.  Each  box  is  normally  defined  by  a
different  imaging  step;  that  is,  one  box  corresponds  to
the substrate geometry and the other box corresponds to
the   overlaying   pattern   (5.4).   The   two   boxes   are
designed to be concentric.
7. 2.1.3
The design elements are the fe ature dimensions
of  the  outer  box,  B
o
,  and  of  the  inner  box,  B
i
.  The
dimensions should follow these guidelines:
outer box: B
o
= 12 – 30 micrometers (μm)
inner box: B
i
= B
o
/2
These  specifications  define  a  range  of  box  sizes  and
their interfeature spacing. Users should modify the box-
in-box dimensions as dictated by design rules, process,
and/or  measurement  equipment  requirements.  The  user
should  recognize  that  edges  in  close  proximity  may
cause measurement errors.
7. 2.2
Frame-in-Frame (see Figure 2 )
7. 2.2.1   The  frame-in-frame  test  patter n  is  designed  to
be a test pattern for overlay measurement on metrology
equipment.  It  has  two  designed  edges  per  axis  on  each
side  of  each  imaged  step.  The  additional  information
gained by having two features on each level, each with
a  centerline,  may  reduce  the  measurement  uncertainty
as compared to the box-in-box design.
7. 2.2.2
The  design  elements  are  the  pi tch  of  opposite
members  of  the  outer  frame  (F
o
),  the  pitch  of  opposite
members  of  the  inner  frame  (F
i
),  and  the  widths  of  the
frames  (W
o
and/or  W
i
)  as  shown  in  Figure  2.  Each
frame  is  normally  defined  by  a  different  imaging  step;
that is, one frame corresponds to the substrate geometry
and the other box corresponds to the overlaying pattern
(see 5.4). The frames are designed to be concentric.
7. 2.2.3
The   design   elements   are   the   ou termost
dimension   of   the   outer   frame   (F
o
),   the   outermost

SEMI P28-96 © SEMI 19963
dimension  for  the  inner  frame  (F
i
),  and  the  width(s)  of
the  frames  (W
o
and/or  W
i
).  The  dimensions  should
follow these guidelines:
outer frame:  F
o
= 15–30 micrometers (μm)
inner frame:  F
i
= F
o
/2
width:  W = 1.0–1.5 μm for F
o
≤ 24 μm, or 1.5–2.0
μm for F
o
≥ 24 μm
NOTE: The width of the inner and outer bars may differ.
These  specifications  define  a  range  of  frame  sizes  and
their interfeature spacing. Users may modify the frame-
in-frame   dimensions   as   dictated   by   design   rules,
process, and/or measurement equipment requirements.
7. 2.3
Bars-in-Bars (see Figure 3)
7. 2.3.1  The bars-in-bars test pattern is  designed to be a
test  pattern  for  overlay  measurement  on  metrology
equipment.  Each  axis  has  two  designed  edges  per  axis
on  each  side  of  each  imaging  step.  The  additional
information  gained  by  having  two  features  on  each
level,    each    with    a    centerline,    may    reduce    the
measurement  uncertainty  as  compared  to  the  box-in-
box design.
7. 2.3.2
The overlay test pattern consis ts of two sets of
bars, the outer set and the inner set. Each set of bars is
arranged  to  form  an  overlay  measurement  frame  as
shown  in  Figure  3.  Each  bar-in-bar  set  is  normally
defined  by  a  different  imaging  step;  that  is,  the  set  of
inner  bars  corresponds  to  the  substrate  geometry  and
the  set  of  outer  bars  corresponds  to  the  overlaying
pattern  (5.4),  or  vice  versa.  The  two  sets  of  bars  are
designed to be concentric.
7. 2.3.3
The design elements are the pi tch for the outer
set of bars (B
o
),  the  pitch  for  the  inner  set  of  bars  (B
i
),
the length of the outer bars (L
o
), the length of the inner
bars  (L
i
),  and  the  width(s)  of  the  bars  (W
o
and/or  W
i
).
The overlay test pattern dimensions should follow these
guidelines:
outer bar set:     B
o
= 15–30 μm
inner bar set:     B
i
= B
o
/2
outer bar length:   L
o
= 50%–70% B
o
inner bar length:   L
I
= 50%–70% B
i
width:  W = 1.0–1.5 μm for B
o
≤ 24 μm, or 1.5–2.0
μm for B
o
≥ 24 μm
NOTE: The width of the inner and outer bars may differ.
These  specifications  define  a  range  of  box  sizes  and
their  interfeature  spacing.  Users  may  modify  the  box-
in-box dimensions as dictated by design rules, process,
and/or  measurement  equipment  requirements.  The  user
should  recognize  that  edges  in  close  proximity  may
cause measurement errors.
7. 3
User Considerations    for    Overl ay-Metrology
Equipment
7. 3.1    Pattern   Acquisition   —   To   ensu re   automatic
acquisition  of  the  desired  overlay  test  pattern  by  an
image-based  automated  overlay  metrology  equipment,
one or more of the following may be required:
1.   Separation  of  each  overlay  test  pattern  as  required
per metrology equipment specification.
2.   Use   of   only   one   overlay   test   pattern   in   the
measurement field-of-view.
3.   Printing  unique  labels  next  to  each  overlay  test
pattern  using  the  proximity  guideline  in  Section
6. 3.3.
7. 3.2
Feature  Dimensions  —  For  ea ch  overlay  test
pattern,  only  a  range  of  feature  dimensions  is  defined
(e.g., paragraph 7.2.2.3). The user and supplier together
should determine that the dimensions of the overlay test
patterns they select are those that consider design rules,
the  user’s  process  capability,  and  limitations  of  the
microlithography and measurement equipment.
7. 3.2.1
Width  Dimensions  (frame-in-f rame  or  bars-in-
bars  test  patterns)  —  When  all  features  of  the  overlay
test  pattern  are  imaged  at  the  same  process  step,  the
widths of the inner and outer features are recommended
to  be  equal,  and  of  the  same  polarity,  in  order  to
minimize overlay-measurement errors.

GUIDELINE FOR DESCRIPTION OF CHARACTERISTICS SPECIFIC TO
HALFTONE/ATTENUATED PHASE SHIFT MASKS AND MASK BLANKS
1  Purpose
1. 1   This  guideline  defines  the  char acteristics  specific
to   halftone/attenuated   phase   shift   masks   and   mask
blanks.
1. 2  This guideline is intended to p rovide a baseline for
specification  of  phase  shift  masks  and  mask  blanks  to
be agreed between the supplier and user.
Because    the    phase    shift    mask    is    still    under
development, it may be needed to continue the research
activity to standardize a final specification.
2  Scope
2. 1  This guideline applies to halfto ne/attenuated phase
shift  masks  and  mask  blanks  for  g-line,  i-line,  KrF,
ArF, and/or DUV wavelengths.
2. 2  These types of masks can be c alled either halftone
or  attenuated  phase  shift  masks.  This  guideline  uses
“halftone phase shift masks” as the nomenclature.
2. 3  Items not described in this gui deline shall conform
to SEMI P1.
3  Referenced Documents
NOTE:  As  listed  or  revised,  all  documents  cited  shall  be  the
latest publications of adopted standards.

4  Terminology
4. 1  Terms for General Description
4. 1.1    halftone   phase   shift   mask   —   a    photomask
designed   to   increase   resolution   through   intentional
control   of   light   transmittance   and   phase   against   a
transparent  part  by  replacing  a  conventional  opaque
pattern with a thin, partially transmitting film (halftone
shifter  film)  that  controls  light  phase  difference  and
transmittance.
4. 1.2   phase  shift  mask  —  a  photoma sk  designed  to
increase  resolution  through  intentional  control  of  the
exposure light phase.
4. 2  Terms for Structural Descripti on
4. 2.1   additional  film  type  opaque  rin g  —  an  opaque
ring  composed  of  light  shield  materials  other  than  the
shifter.
4. 2.2  embedded shifter type opaque  ring — an opaque
ring composed of small rectangles or line/space patterns
in a shifter.
4. 2.3    multilayer   halftone   phase   shift    mask   —   a
halftone  phase  shift  mask  having  multiple  thin  films  of
different  material  compositions  to  give  a  certain  phase
difference and transmittance. The layer that adjoins the
substrate should be called the first layer.
4. 2.4   opaque  ring  —  an  area  of  a  ce rtain  width,
adjacent  to  the  periphery  of  the  desired  exposure  area
on  a  reticle,  located  in  the  non-exposure  area  of  the
reticle  to  obtain  a  dark  portion  required  in  a  wafer
lithography process.
4. 2.5    single-layer   halftone   phase   shi ft   mask —
halftone phase shift mask having a thin film of uniform
material  composition  to  give  a  certain  phase  difference
and transmittance.
4. 3  Terms for Description of Optic al Characteristics
4. 3.1   glass  side  reflectivity  —  a  ratio   of  intensity  of
reflected light to intensity of incident light into the glass
side   that   is   the   backside   of   the   shifter   film.   The
intensity  of  incident  light  is  usually  calculated  by  the
intensity  of  reflected  light  measured  using  a  reference
mirror. (Figure 1 illustrates the glass side reflectivity.)
Figure 1
Glass Side Reflectivity

SEMI P29-0997 © SEMI 19972
4. 3.2  opaque ring transmittance —  a ratio of intensity
of  light  transmitted  through  the  additional  film  type
opaque ring area to intensity of incident light measured
with  air  reference.  (Figure  2  illustrates  the  opaque  ring
transmittance.)
NOTE  1:  For  a  halftone  phase  shift  mask  with  embedded
shifter type opaque ring, transmittance of the opaque ring area
is not defined in this guideline because it depends heavily on
the characteristics of the optical systems used.
Figure 2
Opaque Ring Transmittance
4. 3.3    opening   area   transmittance   —    a   ratio   of
intensity of light transmitted through an opening area of
a  patterned  halftone  phase  shift  mask  to  intensity  of
vertical   incident   light   measured   with   air   reference.
(Figure 3 illustrates the opening area transmittance.)
Figure 3
Opening Area Transmittance
4. 3.4  phase difference — a differenc e in phase of light
generated by vertical transmission through a shifter area
and  an  opening  area  with  air  equivalent  to  the  shifter
film in thickness.
4. 3.5   relative  transmittance  —  a  rat io  of  intensity  of
light  transmitted  through  a  shifter  area  to  intensity  of
light  transmitted  through  an  opening  area.  (Figure  4
illustrates the relative transmittance.)

Relative Transmittance
4. 3.6   shifter  side  reflectivity  —  a  rat io  of  intensity  of
reflected  light  to  intensity  of  incident  light  onto  the
surface  of  a  shifter  film.  The  reflected  light  is  the  sum
of   the   reflected   light   from   the   shifter   surface   and
reflected  light  from  the  boundary  between  shifter  and
glass,  and  the  boundary  between  glass  and  air.  The
reflectivity    depends    on    the    incident    angle,    the
wavelength  of  the  light,  and  the  extent  of  polarization
of  the  incident  light.  The  intensity  of  incident  light  is
usually  calculated  by  the  intensity  of  reflected  light
measured  using  reference  mirror.  (Figure  5  illustrates
the shifter side reflectivity.)

Shifter Side Reflectivity
4. 3.7  shifter area transmittance — r atio of intensity of
light  transmitted  through  a  shifter  area  of  a  halftone
phase shift mask (blank) to intensity of vertical incident
light  measured  with  air  reference.  (Figure  6  illustrates

approximate  line  defined  between  the  nominal  and
measured dimensions.
4. 1.9.2  linearity  —  variations  in  measurement  values
without changing device and wafer conditions.  This is

wafer unloading.
4. 1.9.4  static  repeatability  —  variations  in  average
measurement   values   acquired   in   a   sequence   for   a
pattern.  This is the closeness of agreement between the
measured  values  obtained  by  measuring  a  pattern  with
wafer  loading,  wafer  alignment,  stage  traveling  to  a
measurement  site,  positioning  of  a  measured  pattern,
measuring, and wafer unloading.

operation  sequence.    There  are  three  methods:  auto,
semi-auto, and manual.
4. 1.11.1  automatic  operation  method  —  the  operation
method controlled by a computer automatically, after an
operator sets a carrier on the equipment.  The computer
follows  the  commands  written  in  a  recipe.    Uses  a
recipe on a computer.
4. 1.11.2  manual  operation  —  the  operation  method
controlled  by  an  operator  without  a  recipe.    Uses  an
operator.
4. 1.11.3  semi-auto  operation  —  the  operating  method
controlled by a computer and an operator.  The operator
confirms the results of each command in a recipe using
an automatic operation.  Uses a recipe with an operator.
4. 1.12  pattern  edge  determination  method  —  uses  a
computer  or  an  operator  to  look  at  the  image.    This  is
the method for determining the edge position of a given
pattern,  which  is  calculated  by  computer  algorithm  or
by operator instructions.
4. 1.12.1  automatic pattern edge determination — there
are  several  methods,  such  as  the  threshold  method,  the
linear   approximation   method,   and   the   curve   fitting
method.  This is the method used to determine the edge

TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF TRACE METALS IN
PHOTORESIST
This  test  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Micropatterning  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  Japanese  Micropatterning  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  Japanese
Regional  Standards  Committee  on  July  23,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  August  2004;  to  be
published November 2004.  Originally published September 1998.
1  Purpose
1. 1        This    document    describes    an    outline    of    a
quantitative     analysis     method     on     trace     metal
concentration.  This  standard  is  intended  to  promote
communication between users and suppliers.
2  Scope
2. 1    This  document  applies  to  a  measurement  of  trace
metal   concentration   in   ppb   level   in   photoresist   by
instrumental  techniques,  such  as  Atomic  Absorption
Spectrometry,  Plasma  Ion  Source  Mass  Spectrometry,
and   Inductively   Coupled   Plasma   Atomic   Emission
Spectrometry.
2. 2    Object  metals  in  this  measurement  are  Al,  Ca,  Cr,
Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, K, and Na.
2. 3    Either  additional  metals  or  fewer  can  be  agreed
upon  between  users  and  suppliers  and  are  added  to  the
measurement list.
2. 4  The following method has given satisfactory results
in  determining  trace  metal  impurities  at  the  specified
value  for  each  of  the  target  trace  metals.  Alternative
methods   or   conditions   may   be   used   as   long   as
appropriate   studies   demonstrate   recovery   between
75%ñ125%  of  a  known  sample  spike  for  half  the
specification  value.  The  results  should  be  reported  as
within  specification  (below  a  certain  value)  or  not  in
specification only (SEMI C1).
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

4  Summary of Method
4. 1    Photoresist  test  solution  is  prepared  by  dry  ashing
method  or  direct  method.  Then  trace  metals  in  the  test
solution     are     measured     by     Atomic     Absorption
Spectrometry,  Plasma  Ion  Source  Mass  Spectrometry,
or   Inductively   Coupled   Plasma   Atomic   Emission
Spectrometry.    The    trace    metal    concentration    is
determined using a working curve, which is obtained by
measuring a standard solution.
5  Terminology
5. 1  Definitions
5. 1.1  blank  test  ó  a  measurement  without  the  object
photoresist,  which  is  performed  under  the  standard
procedures.
5. 1.2  dilution    factor    ó    numerical    number    that
indicates final amount of solution divided by the initial
amount of solution in the preparation of the photoresist
process.
5. 1.3  direct  method  ó  a  sample  preparation  method
for   preparing   samples   for   direct   trace   metal   in
photoresist. The materials are diluted with a solvent and
then analyzed by the appropriate analytical instrument.
5. 1.4  dry   ashing   method   ó   a   sample   preparation
method  for  preparing  samples  used  in  measuring  trace
metals  in  the  photoresist.  The  photoresist  is  evaporated
and decomposed to ash by heating. The ash is dissolved
in  a  volumetric  flask  with  acid  and  aqueous  reagent,
and   then   analyzed   by   the   appropriate   analytical
instrument.
5. 1.5  plasma   ion   source   mass   spectrometry   ó   a
method  that  isolates  and  measures  quantitative  metal
element    by    mass    spectrometer    using    plasma    as
excitation  source.  Inductively  Coupled  Plasma  Mass
Spectrometry    (ICP-MS)    and    Microwave    Induced
Plasma  Mass  Spectrometry  (MIP-MS)  belong  to  this
category.
5. 1.6  working curve ó the relationship between known
metal concentrations prepared by standard solutions and
the observed values of instrumental analysis.

4  Terminology
4. 1  230 mm — the nominal edge l ength for the reticle
generation  defined  in  this  specification.    Also  referred
to as “9 inch” size.
4. 2  critical side — major side inte nded for patterning.
The   critical   side   has   no   chamfered   corner(s)   (see
Section 9.2), and has flatness equal to or better than the
non-critical side (see Section 8.1).
4. 3   non-critical  side  —  major  side   not  intended  for
patterning.    Any  and  all  chamfered  corners  are  on  the
non-critical side (see Section 9.2, Figures 5 and 6).

substrates  furnished  to  this  specification  shall  include
the following:
5. 1.1 Nominal     edge     length,     nominal      thickness
dimension, edge criteria, and parallelism of major sides
(see Section 6);
5. 1.2  Material (see Section 7);
5. 1.3  Flatness quality area and flatne ss Total Indicated
Reading (TIR; see Section 8);
5. 1.4  Visual quality area (see Sectio n 9); and
5. 1.5  Lot acceptance criteria (see Se ction 10).
6  Dimensions and Permissi b le Variations
6. 1   The  substrates  shall  conform  t o  the  dimensional
tolerances  appropriate  to  the  nominal  edge  length  and
thickness   as   listed   in   Table   1.      Dimensions   are
illustrated  in  Figure  1,  and  a  fixture  for  measuring  the
squareness dimensions is shown in Figure 2.
6. 2   Substrates  shall  have  beveled  e dges.    The  edges
shall conform to the dimensional tolerances appropriate
to the nominal thickness listed in Table 2.  Dimensions
are illustrated in Figure 3.
6. 3   The  major  sides  of  square  subs trates  shall  be
parallel   within   5.0   μm   along   both   major   axes.
Measurements are taken within the quality flatness area,
along  both  major  axes.    Calculation  of  parallelism  is
illustrated in Figure 7.
7  Material Specifications
7. 1   Substrate  materials  shall  be  sp ecified  “ultra  low
thermal  expansion”  (ULTE).    An  example  of  ULTE
material is fused silica (quartz).
7. 2  Selected physical properties of  ULTE materials are
provided for information only in Appendix 1.
8  Flatness Specifications
8. 1   Substrates  shall  be  supplied  w ith  two  major  sides
having  flatness  (TIR)  of  1,  2,  or  5  μm  over  a  square
quality  flatness  area  as  defined  in  Figure  4.    Sides  are
not  required  to  have  equivalent  flatness.  (NOTE:  0.5
μm  is  not  yet  available  but  is  widely  expected  in  the

SEMI P33-0998 © SEMI 19982
near  future.    Flatness  of  0.5  μm  is  very  desirable  for
semiconductor   production,   and   equipment   suppliers
may want to consider this in their designs.)
9  Visual Criteria
9. 1   A  visual  quality  area,  which  m ay  or  may  not
correspond with the flatness area, shall be agreed upon
between the user and supplier.
9. 2   Fused  silica  (ULTE)  substrates   shall  be  identified
with   one   corner   chamfer   as   shown   in   Figure   5.
Dimensions  of  the  chamfer  shall  be  as  specified  in
Figure 6.  The corner chamfer is made only on the non-
critical side of the substrate.
10  Sampling
10. 1   Unless  otherwise  specified,  ap propriate  sample
sizes shall be selected from each lot in accordance with
ANSI/ASQC Z1.4.  Each quality characteristic shall be
assigned    an    acceptable    quality    level    (AQL)    in
accordance   with   ANSI/ASQC   Z1.4   definitions   for
critical,  major,  and  minor  classifications.    If  desired,
and  so  specified  in  the  contract  or  order,  each  of  these
classifications may alternatively be assigned cumulative
AQL  values.    Inspection  levels  shall  be  agreed  upon
between user and supplier.
