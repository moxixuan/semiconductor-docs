TEST METHOD FOR ESCA EVALUATION OF SURFACE
COMPOSITION OF WETTED SURFACES OF PASSIVATED 316L
STAINLESS STEEL COMPONENTS
This test method was technically approved by the Global Facilities Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Facilities  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North  American  Regional
Standards  Committee  on  November  22,  2000.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  December  2000;  to  be
published March 2001.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1   The  purpose  of  this  document   is  to  define  a
method   for   testing   passivated   316L   stainless   steel
components  being  considered  for  installation  into  a
high-purity gas distribution system.  Application of this
test  method  is  expected  to  yield  comparable  results
among    components    tested    for    the    purposes    of
qualification for this installation.</li><li>2   This  document  defines  a  meth od  of  testing  the
interior   surfaces   of   stainless   steel   tubing,   fittings,
valves,  and  other  components  to  determine  the  surface
composition   and   chemistry,   as   a   measure   of   the
effectiveness of passivation processes.</li><li>3   The  objective  of  this  method  is   to  describe  a
general set of instrument parameters and conditions that
will  achieve  precise  and  reproducible  measurements  of
important   surface   chemistry   within   the   chromium-
enriched oxide layer.
2  Scope</li><li>1    This   document   describes   a   test    method   to
characterize   “as   received”   surface   composition   and
chemistry     encompassing     all     chromium-enriched
stainless  steel  surfaces  in  tubing,  fittings,  valves,  and
other     components.          This     procedure     involves
measurement   of   total   Cr/Fe   ratios,   Cr
ox
/Fe
ox
oxide
species  ratios,  and  the  surface  elemental  compositions
by   Electron   Spectroscopy   for   Chemical   Analysis
(ESCA),  also  called  X-ray  Photoelectron  Spectroscopy
(XPS).</li><li>2  This document also describes  the test method for a
compositional ESCA depth profile measurement for Cr,
Fe,  Ni,  O  and  C  from  the  as-received  surface,  through
the  oxide  layers,  and  extending  into  the  base  metal.
The  depth  profile  measurement  evaluates  the  oxide
thickness  and  the  relative  composition  throughout  the
modified  surface  layer  as  a  result  of  the  passivation
process.</li><li>3   This  standard  does  not  purport   to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1   This  test  method  is  intended  to   be  used  by  ESCA
analysts    familiar    with    the    instrumentation    and
technique.    The  ESCA  instrument  must  be  calibrated
and      maintained      to      pertinent      manufacturer’s
specifications.  The method is not intended to preclude
the  use  of  any  particular  brand  or  model  of  surface
analysis    equipment.        While    most    of    the    test
methodology    has    been    developed    using    specific
instrumentation,  this  method  can  be  adapted  to  most
surface analytical instrumentation.</li><li>2    The   effects   of   the   depth   of   ana lysis   of   the
technique  and  surface  contamination  affect  the  results
of this test method.  These are discussed in the attached
appendix.      Surface   roughness,   non-planarity   of   the
surface, and differential sputtering rates for the different
chemical  species  also  cause  measurement  uncertainties
in this test method

5. 2  Definitions
5. 2.1   sampling  volume  —  the  volum e  from  which
photoelectrons are detected.  The x-ray spot size and/or
the  lens  and  aperture  system  of  the  electron  analyzer
determine  lateral  dimensions.  A  length  of  three  times
the  photoelectron  mean  free  path  is  considered  the
maximum    depth    sensitivity.    Sampling    volume    is
dependent  on  the  sample  material  and  TOA.    The
acceptance angle of the analyzer will also influence the
distribution of the depth information.
5. 2.2    take-off   angle   (TOA)   —   the   an gle   that   the
collection lens forms with the sample plane.
6  Summary of Method
6. 1 Data Acquisition
6. 1.1     Acquire    elemental    survey    and     calculate
elemental composition of “as received” wetted surface.
6. 1.2   Acquire  chromium  and  iron  re gions  at  high
resolution.    Calculate  total  Cr/Fe  ratio  and  Cr  oxide/Fe
oxide ratios from these regions.
6. 1.3    Acquire   a   compositional   depth    profile   to
determine  the  relative  abundance  of  C,  O,  Cr,  Fe  and
Ni.    Additional  elements  may  be  included  as  desired
(i.e.,  molybdenum,  silicon  and  nitrogen).    If  minor
elements  are  included  in  the  profile  the  instrument
parameters  should  be  chosen  to  allow  for  a  detection
limit of 1 atomic percent (at%) or better.

7  Possible Interferences
7. 1  Mo (3d) and S (2s) — use S (2 p) for quantification
of  sulfur.    Molybdenum  will  appear  as  a  doublet;
quantity may be overestimated.
7. 2  Fe (2p
3/2
) and Ni Auger — ign ore.
7. 3   Mo  (3p)  and  N  (1s)  —  the  abil ity  to  accurately
quantify  the  nitrogen  will  depend  upon  the  chemical
state  of  both  the  nitrogen  and  molybdenum.    In  some
cases  the  nitrogen  will  be  overestimated  from  a  survey
scan quantification.
8  Apparatus
8. 1   Instrumentation  —  Any  ESCA   i nstrument  with
definable  area  of  analysis  approximately  1  mm  or  less
and  sufficient  count  rate  to  provide  detection  of  low
level contaminants at one atomic percent or greater.  A
count  rate  of  at  least  100,000  counts  per  minute  for
clean Au (4f
7/2
) should indicate sufficient sensitivity.
8. 2   The  instrument  should  have  pe ak  resolution  of  1
eV  FWHM  Au  (4f
7/2
)  or  better  (i.e.,  &lt;  1  eV)  to  ensure
species   separation   of   metallic   and   oxide   forms   of
chromium and iron.
8. 3   If  the  instrument  is  of  a  variab le  take-off  angle
(TOA) design, the geometry should be set to a TOA of
approximately   35
o
.      Instruments   with   geometries
significantly   different   from   this,   or   with   magnetic
electron  collection  lens  may  provide  analysis  from  a
different  sampling  volume.    The  angle  of  the  incident
X-ray  irradiation  with  respect  to  the  sample  plane  and
TOA must be recorded.
8. 4   Data  reduction  software  must   have  the  ability  to
select an iterated Shirley-curve background.
9  Reagents and Materials
9. 1    Instrument   Calibration   Materi als   —   Refer   to
instrument  manufacturer  recommendations  or  ASTM
E902.  A measurement of the binding energy difference
between  the  Au  (4f
7/2
)  at  84.0  eV  and  Cu  (2p
3/2
)  at
932. 6   eV   is   an   acceptable   method   of   calibrating
analyzer  linearity.    A  value  of  ± 3σ  based  upon  a
minimum  of  10  historical  measurements  of  less  than  ±
0. 25 eV is acceptable.</p><p>SEMI F60-0301 © SEMI 20013
9. 2  Statistical Process Control Ma terial — A nominal
316L  material  with  a  composition  range  within  the
guidelines  of  ASTM  A276.    The  composition  of  the
bulk   material   should   be   determined   by   methods
consistent with ASTM A751.
10  Safety Precautions
10. 1   This  test  method  does  not  purp ort  to  address  the
safety   considerations   associated   with   use   of   high
voltage,  vacuum,  and  X-ray  producing  equipment.  The
method  assumes  an  ESCA  analyst  with  knowledge  of
instrumentation and associated safety precautions.
11  Test Specimen
11. 1  Specimens are to be sectioned  to appropriate size
for  the  particular    ESCA  instrument  using  a  clean,  dry
hacksaw  or  dry  low  speed  bandsaw.    Any  sample
preparation  shall  avoid  introducing  contamination  onto
the  surface  to  be  measured.    In  addition,  preparation
must  avoid  excessive  heating  of  the  sample,  i.e.,  the
surface  temperature  shall  not  exceed  50
o
C,  to  avoid
oxide growth or change in surface composition.
11. 2  Sample preparation should pre ferably be done by
the component manufacturer.  Following sectioning the
sample(s)  are  to  be  cleaned  and  packaged  per  the
manufacturer’s  standard  final  cleaning  and  packaging
procedures.
11. 3   If  sample  preparation  is  done  b y  other  than  the
manufacturer,  the  sample(s)  may  be  cleaned  in  DI
water.      If   the   sample(s)   are   not   to   be   analyzed
immediately  they  should  be  packaged  by  wrapping  in
clean  metal  foil  or  sealing  in  cleanroom  quality  nylon
bags.
11. 4   If  sample  preparation  is  done  b y  other  than  the
manufacturer this shall be stated in the report narrative
and  the  analytical  results  are  not  to  be  interpreted  as
indicative of the manufacturer’s quality of cleaning and
packaging  procedures.    A  note  to  this  effect  shall  be
included   in   all   tables   of   reported   results   of   the
composition of the surface.
11. 5   After  preparation,  samples  sho uld  be  analyzed
promptly,   with   allowance   for   shipping   times   and
queuing time at the analyst.
12  Preparation of Apparatus
12. 1     Instruments    shall    be    routinely     tested    in
accordance   with   manufacturer   recommendations   to
assure  proper  performance.    The  instrument  vacuum
shall be 1.0E-7 Torr or better during the analysis.
13  Calibration and Standardi zation
13. 1    Proper   instrument   calibration   i s   necessary   to
provide  the  most  accurate  and  reproducible  results,
particularly  if  results  are  compared  among  different
laboratories.      Instrument   calibration   for   sensitivity
factors  and  binding  energies  shall  be  performed  in
accordance     with     the     instrument     manufacturer
recommendations  or  other  accepted  method,  such  as
that provided in ASTM E902.
13. 2     The    general    ESCA    calibration     procedures
described  above  are  suitable  for  most  analyses  and
provide    reasonably    accurate    relative    quantitative
information regarding the surface chemistry.  However,
in  order  to  establish  the  most  accurate  measurement
practical    and    to    maintain    the    desired    level    of
reproducibility    over    time,    an    application-specific
statistical process control (SPC) shall be established for
this test method to determine the appropriate sensitivity
factors  for  Cr,  Fe,  Ni  and  Mo  in  316L  stainless  steel.
The  bulk  composition  of  the  SPC  material  should  have
an  assay  consistent  with  the  acceptable  composition
range  of  316L  for  Cr,  Fe,  Ni  and  Mo,  as  set  forth  in
ASTM   A276.      The   bulk   composition   of   the   SPC
material  should  be  determined  by  methods  consistent
with  ASTM  A751.    The  relative  sensitivity  factors
established  for  the  quantification  of  data  should  reflect

standard  after  a  sputter  cleaning  sufficient  to  remove
any  surface  contamination  and  the  oxide  passive  layer.
A  ±  3σ  relative  precision  should  be  established  from  a

tolerances:

standard.    A  minimum  sputtering  etch  cleaning  of  the
SPC    sample  of  ≥  10  nanometers  is  recommended  in
order   to   remove   surface   contamination,   the   oxide
passive  layer  and  establish  equilibrium.    Note  that  the
degree  of  preferential  sputtering  and  other  ion  etching
artifacts  are  a  function  of  the  matrix  material  and  the
ion gun conditions.
13. 4   Calibration  frequency  of  the  ap plication  specific
SPC  should  be  designed  to  establish  a  record  of  the
reproducibility  and  accuracy  of  the  measurement,  as
reflected   by   the   nominal   composition   of   the   316L
standard.    A  minimum  frequency  of  one  per  week  is
recommended,  or  immediately  prior  to  performing  a
measurement in accordance with this test method.
13. 5  A sputter rate calibration shall  be performed prior
to    an    ESCA    profile    measurement    conducted    in
accordance  to  this  test  method.    The  ion  sputter  rate
determination  shall  be  made  using  standard  thin  films
of 100 nanometers or less of SiO
2
on Si.  The method of
determining  the  thickness  of  the  oxide  film  shall  be
based  upon  the  oxygen  concentration  profile.    The
oxide  –  substrate  interface  shall  be  specified  as  the
point at which the oxygen concentration decreases to ½
its  maximum  value  in  the  SiO
2
film,  ignoring  the  first
sputter cycle.
13. 6   Multiple  samples  may  be  analy zed  following  a
single   sputter   rate   determination   if   the   ion   gun
parameters  have  not  been  adjusted  and  the  ion  gun
performance is documented as stable over the period in
question.
14  Procedure
14. 1  As-Received Surface Analysis—  T he sample is to
be    mounted    in    accordance    with    manufacturer&#x27;s
recommendations and in a manner consistent with ultra-
high  vacuum  surface  analytical  procedures.    Some  of
these practices are detailed in ASTM-E1078.  The area
to be analyzed should be mounted parallel to the sample
holder surface so that TOA is well known.
14. 1.1   Place  the  sample  in  the  ESCA   introduction
chamber  for  pump  down.    Transfer  to  the  analytical
chamber   at   the   manufacturer&#x27;s   recommended   base
pressure.    Align  the  sample  with  respect  to  the  X-ray
beam and analyzer so that optimum count rate from the
desired  analytical  location  is  obtained.    The  use  of  a
collimated  high  voltage  electron  beam  to  align  the
sample should be avoided, as this may pyrolyze surface
carbon  and  potentially  alter  surface  oxide  chemistry.
The  surface  area  to  be  analyzed  should  be  free  of
visible particles and large defect features, if possible.
14. 1.2   A  beam  size  as  close  to  1  mm   as  possible
should    be    used    to    ensure    measurement    of    a
representative  surface.    If  surface  curvature  is  great
(e.g., &lt; 1/4&quot; tubing), a smaller beam may be employed.
Elemental survey data (0–1100 eV) are to be measured
from  the  sample  surface  to  determine  the  elements
present  and  their  approximate  surface  abundance.    A
high throughput analyzer setting may be used to obtain
a signal to noise ratio (S/N) sufficient to detect common
surface  contaminants  such  as  sulfur  and  phosphorus  at
one atomic percent or better.
14. 1.3   Using  instrument  settings  suffi cient  to  provide
a  FWHM  peak  width  of  1.0  eV  or  less  on  Au  (4f
7/2
),
measure chromium, iron, and carbon regions.  A typical
region width is 20 eV.  Suggested ranges are as follows:
Cr  (2p
3/2
)  from  570  to  590  eV,  Fe  (2p
3/2
)  from  700  to
720 eV, and C (1s) from 275 to 295 eV.  Signal to noise
ratios of greater than 20 are suggested.
14. 1.4  A consistent method of data re duction of high-
resolution   surface   spectra   is   necessary   in   order   to
provide  meaningful  comparison  of  the  relative  Cr:Fe
ratios.
14. 1.5   The  spectra  shall  be  charge  co mpensated  with
respect to the maximum of the Cr (2p
3/2
) set to 577 eV.
An  iterated  Shirley  method  of  background  subtraction
shall be applied to the Fe (2p
3/2
) and Cr (2p
3/2
) spectral
regions, using a minimum of three iterations.
14. 1.6   The  curve  fit  regions  shall  typi cally  extend
from:
Cr (2p
3/2
)570–582 eV
Fe (2p
3/2
)704–717 eV
14. 1.7    The   curve   fit   peak   parameters    should   be
initialized as follows:

)Peak PositionFWHM% gaussian

37101. 480

14. 1.8 The curve fit routine should ap ply the following
tolerances  for  the  band  limit  parameters  of  all  peaks
defined above:
FWHM delta
≤ 0.2 eV
% gaussian delta
≤ 10%
Curve fit position delta
≤ 0.25 eV
14. 1.9    An   automated   form   of   data   red uction   is
recommended to enhance reproducibility and minimize</p><p>SEMI F60-0301 © SEMI 20015
analyst   subjectivity   associated   with   the   curve   fit
procedure.    If  it  is  necessary  to  deviate  from  the  curve
fit   parameters   outlined   above   in   order   to   obtain   a
satisfactory  curve  fit  it  should  be  noted  in  the  formal
report.    Possible  sources  for  the  anomalous  behavior
include  an  excessive  concentration  of  iron  oxide  or  a
sufficiently  aged  sample  surface,  such  that  the  oxide
surface chemistry and structure has modified.
14. 2    Depth   Profile   Analysis—   The   E SCA   depth
profile  may  be  performed  following  acquisition  of  the
initial   as-received   surface   survey   scan   and   high-
resolution  spectra  using  the  same  sample  x-y  position
and take-off angle of 35°.
14. 2.1   The  depth  profile  may  be  acqu ired  in  either
continuous mode (simultaneous sputter etching and data
acquisition)  or  alternating  sputter  etch/data  acquisition
mode.        The    following    acquisition    windows    are
recommended:
Spectral lineLower limitRange
C280 eV15 eV
O525 eV15 eV
Cr570 eV15 eV
Ni848 eV15 eV
Fe700 eV25 eV
14. 2.2   If  only  an  elemental  compositi onal  profile  is
acquired,  any  pass  energy  may  be  selected  as  long  as
the  remaining  acquisition  parameters  defined  by  the
number  of  sweeps,  step  size  and  dwell  time  result  in  ≤</p><ol><li>0at% detection of the matrix elements followed in the
depth profile.</li><li>2.3    The   composition   profile   shoul d   extend   far
enough  into  the  depth  of  the  sample  to  reach  the  base
metal composition of the 316L material, but a minimum
of 100Å from the surface as referenced to the calibrated
sputter rate in SiO
2
.
15  Calculations and Interpret ation of Results</li><li>1     Most    manufacturers    supply    so ftware    for
determination of elemental composition.  The elemental
composition   should   be   calculated   using   sensitivity
factors appropriate to the instrument, each element, and
resolution settings for each measurement.</li><li>2  The total Cr/Fe ratio is calcula ted by adding peak
areas  from  all  species  of  each  element,  adjusting  for
different  numbers  of  scans  and  sensitivity  factors,  and
dividing  the  Cr  result  by  the  Fe  result.    The  Cr  oxide/
Fe oxide ratio is calculated in a similar manner, except
that only peaks 2 and 3 for Cr and only peaks 3 through
5 for Fe (oxide species) are used.  The formulas are as
follows:
Total  Cr/Fe  =  (Σ  Cr  peak  areas)/#  Cr  scans/Cr  sensitivity  factor
(Σ Fe peak areas)/# Fe scans/Fe sensitivity factor
Cr  Oxide/  =  (Σ
Cr  oxide  peak  areas)/#  Cr  scans/Cr  sens.  factor
Fe Oxide           (Σ Fe oxide peak areas)/# Fe scans/Fe sens. factor
16  Reporting Results</li><li>1    As-Received   Surface   Results   —    A    tabular

supplied with the associated elemental survey spectrum.
If  sample  preparation  has  been  done  by  other  than  the

procedures.”</li><li>1.1   Tabular  summaries  of  total  Cr/ Fe  ratio  and  Cr

determined   as   the   sputter   time/depth   at   which   the
oxygen  concentration  decreases  to  ½  the  maximum
value.      The   carbon   thickness   may   be   determined

APPENDIX 1
DISCUSSION OF EFFECTS OF DEPTH OF ANALYSIS ON DEPTH
PROFILE ANALYSIS BY ELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY FOR
CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF PASSIVATED STAINLESS STEEL
NOTE: This appendix is being balloted as an official part of SEMI F## by full letter ballot procedure, but the recommendation in
this appendix are optional and are not required to conform to this standard. This appendix is derived from presentations made to
the SEMI Surface Analysis Task Force.
A1-1.1  The purpose of this appendix is to describe the
ESCA  (sometimes  referred  to  as  X-Ray  Photoelectron
Spectroscopy    (XPS))    technique    and    explain    the
interpretation  of  the  depth  profile  analysis  with  respect
to  the  structure  and  composition  of  the  passive  oxide
layer  on  stainless  steel.    The  effect  of  the  depth  of
analysis  on  the  measured  chromium  to  iron  ratio,  the
oxide   thickness,   and   the   depth   of   enrichment   is
discussed.    The  discussion  applies  to  depth  profile
analyses  performed  by  Auger  electron  spectroscopy,
also.
A1-1.2  ESCA — The ESCA technique makes use of an
X-ray  beam  for  a  probe.  The  surface  of  interest  is
illuminated   with   X-rays,   typically   Al   kα radiation,
which  has  a  well-defined  energy  of  1486.6  eV.  When
an  x-ray  photon  and  an  electron  interact,  the  electron
adsorbs  all  of  the  energy  of  the  photon,  1486.5  eV;  it
cannot  react  with  it  partially.    The  electron  then  has
sufficient  energy  to  leave  the  atom  and  move  into  the
matrix.    The  electron’s  energy  in  the  matrix  is  1486.6
eV  minus  its  binding  energy  to  the  atom  from  which  it
escaped. Its binding energy is indicative of the element
or  compound  from  which  it  came  and  the  orbital  from
which  it  was  removed.    Such  an  electron  is  termed  a
“photoelectron”.
A1-1.3          In     a     typical     ESCA     instrument,     a
monochromatic beam of x-rays is focused at a point of
interest  on  a  surface.  A  cloud  of  electrons  is  generated
at  the  surface  by  the  x-rays.    This  electron  cloud  is
made  up  of  secondary  electrons,  Auger  electrons  and
photoelectrons.   (NOTE:   The   generation   of   Auger
electrons   is   a   byproduct   of   the   process.   If   the
photoelectron  was  an  inner  shell  electron,  when  it
leaves  the  atom  it  creates  an  ion  in  an  excited  state.
Once  the  ion  is  created  it  can  de-excite  via  the  Auger
process.  The  presence  of  Auger  electrons  in  an  ESCA
survey  can  be  used  to  determine  what  elements  were
present.)  The mechanisms of ESCA photoelectron and
Auger  electron  generation  are  illustrated  in  Figure  A1-</p><h1>1</h1><ol><li>Figure A1-1
Schematic representation of the ESCA
photoelectron and Auger electron generation
processes.
A1-1.4 An electron lens is focused at the same point as
the  x-ray  beam  and  a  portion  of  the  electron  cloud
enters  the  lens.  From  the  lens,  the  electrons  enter  an
electron analyzer that measures the number of electrons
as a function of their kinetic energy. The kinetic energy
is subtracted from the incident x-ray photon energy, and
the resulting binding energy is then plotted as the x-axis
with  the  number  of  electrons  at  each  energy  on  the  y-
axis.  An  example  is  shown  in  Figure  A1-2.    The
binding   energy   can   be   indicative   not   only   of   the
element  from  which  the  electron  came  but  also  the
chemical bonding state of the element.</li></ol><p>SEMI F60-0301 © SEMI 20017

surface of stainless steel
A1-1.5 Illuminated  Volume  and  Surface  Sensitivity  —
The  incident  x-ray  beam  penetrates  well  below  the
surface.    Photoelectrons    and    Auger    electrons    are
generated  all  through  this  illuminated  volume.  The
inelastic mean free path (IMFP) of an electron in a solid
is  the  mean  distance  through  the  solid  that  an  electron
can travel before losing some of its energy (suffering an
inelastic  interaction).    The  IMFP  is  a  function  of  the
electron’s  energy  and  the  matrix  through  which  it  is
traveling.  Electrons  with  an  energy  of  approximately  1
keV have an IMFP of about 10 Å.  That means that a 1
keV  electron  will  travel,  on  average,  10  Å  before
interacting  with  the  matrix  and  giving  up  some  of  its
energy.    In  other  words  it  will  be  scattered  to  lower
energy  and  will  not  be  part  of  the  photoelectron  or
Auger  electron  line  for  its  element.    The  IMFP  is  a
statistical parameter and an electron may travel several
IMFPs  before  having  a  collision.  The  “several  IMFPs”
is  called  the  escape  depth  of  the  electron,  or  the  depth
of analysis, as shown in Figure A1-3.  Although ESCA
and Auger are considered surface analytical tools, their
depth of analysis is on the order of 50 Å, or about one
to  two  times  the  depth  of  the  oxide  film  found  on  a
typical passivated stainless steel surface.
Figure A1-3
The electron escape depth of low energy electrons in
some metals.
A1-1.6 Depth  of  Analysis  Function  —  There  has  been
some discussion with respect to the “Depth of Analysis
Function”.  There  is  one  school  that  believes  that  it  is  5
IMFPs  and  another  that  uses  3  IMFPs.    These  two
functions will be referred to as 5λ and 3λ respectively.
It  will  be  seen  that  it  makes  little  difference  which
function  is  used  even  though  the  depth  of  the  oxide
films  is  of  the  order  of  the  functions.    These  functions
are seen in Figure A1-4, which shows the proportion of
the  total  signal  generated  from  each  depth  below  the
surface.    The  y-axis  is  in  decimal  and  the  x-axis  is  in
angstroms  from  the  surface.  The  first  point  of  the  5λ
curve is 0.16 at the 1
st
angstrom level. That means that
16%  of  the  signal  comes  from  the  1
st
angstrom,  14%
from the 2
nd
angstrom level and so on down to 1% from
the  25
th
angstrom  level.    Thus  elements  that  do  not
appear  on  the  surface  or  in  the  first  24  angstroms  in
from the surface, but do exist at the 25 Å level will be
detected.

A1-1.7    Modeling  —  Figure  A1-5  is  the  composition
profile of a “perfect” oxide.  It represents 25 Å of pure
Cr

O

on an atomically flat 316L stainless steel surface,
with  no  surface  or  interfacial  contamination  present.
Figures  A1-6a  and  A1-6b  are  the  theoretical  depth
profiles  derived  by  assuming  a  depth  of  analysis  of  5λ
and  3λ  respectively.  The  first  factor  to  note  is  that  Fe,
Ni  and  Mo  appear  most  or  all  of  the  way  through  the
depth profile of the oxide due to the contribution of the
metal  substrate  to  the  detected  signal,  the  “depth  of
analysis”  effect  as  introduced  above.  1  keV  electrons
can  escape  from  as  deep  as  25  Å.    This  must  be
appreciated when interpreting these depth profiles.

A1-1.8    The  second  factor  to  notice  is  the  thickness  of
the  oxide.    Historically,  the  FWHM  of  the  oxygen
profile has been used as the measure of oxide thickness.</p><p>SEMI F60-0301 © SEMI 20019
It  is  apparent  in  Figures  A1-5  and  A1-6  that  this
underestimates the oxide thickness by 15 to 20%.
A1-1.8.1    It  should  also  be  noted  that  the  Cr:Fe  ratio
measured   from   Figures   A1-5   and   A1-6   has   its
maximum  value  at  the  initial  surface,  decreasing  as  the
depth profile progresses, whereas the actual Cr:Fe ratio
in  Figure  A1-5  is  infinite  down  to  25  Å.    Most  actual
depth  profiles  exhibit  a  maximum  of  the  Cr:Fe  ratio  at
some  depth  below  the  initial  surface,  referred  to  as  the
depth  of  maximum  enrichment.    This  is  a  consequence
of  variation  in  the  actual  composition  of  the  oxide,
possibly  having  a  higher  concentration  of  Fe  near  the
surface,  a  phenomenon  commonly  termed  a  “detached
iron  oxide  layer”,  or  of  contamination  on  the  surface,
generally  hydrocarbons.    These  are  discussed  in  the
next section.
A1-1.9    Effects  of  Detached  Iron  Oxide  Layer  and
Surface   Contamination   —   The   model   composition
profile of Figure A1-7 shows 3 Å of pure Fe
2

Å  of  pure  Cr
2

on  316L  stainless  steel.    This  is  a
model  of  a  detached  iron  oxide  layer.    Figure  A1-8  is
the   theoretical   depth   profile   of   this   model   derived
assuming a depth of analysis of 5 lambda.  Note that the
initial Cr value in the profile is higher than the Fe value,
even  though  the  surface  is  pure  Fe
2
O
3
.  This is a
consequence  of  the  depth  of  analysis  detecting  the  Cr
from  levels  beneath  the  surface.    The  Cr:Fe  ratio  for
this  model  has  its  maximum  value  at  3  Å  below  the
initial  surface.    The  theoretical  depth  profile  using  a
depth of analysis of 3λ is very similar.

on
316L stainless steel, representing an idealized model of
the   adsorbed   hydrocarbon   contamination   generally
found   on   stainless   steel   surfaces   exposed   to   the
atmosphere.    Figure  A1-10  is  the  theoretical  depth
profile  of  this  model  assuming  a  depth  of  analysis  of
5λ.  In this case the O, Cr and Fe atomic concentration
values  are  reduced  by  the  presence  of  the  carbon  until
the  depth  profiling  proceeds  past  the  carbon,  but  they
have  the  same  relative  values  (ie:  same  Cr:Fe  ratio)
versus  depth  as  derived  in  the  uncontaminated  model.
The  maximum  of  the  Cr:Fe  ratio  is  seen  to  be  at  the
initial  surface.    Although  the  actual  oxide  thickness  is
less  in  this  model,  the  FWHM  measure  of  the  oxide
thickness  from  the  depth  profile  is  the  same  due  to  the
presence  of  the  carbon  layer.    Note  that  the  Oxygen
concentration  profile  initially  increases  to  a  maximum,
then decreases.  This is typical of Oxygen concentration
profiles  seen  on  actual  samples,  which  will  generally
have some adsorbed hydrocarbon contamination on the
surface.</p><p>SEMI F60-0301 © SEMI 200110

water  produced  by  a  semiconductor  water  treatment
system,  which  is  sent  to  the  end  users  for  use  in
manufacturing.
5  General Requirements
5. 1   Materials
 Components  of  t he  UPW  system
must  be  appropriate  to  the  application  and  conform  to
electrical, mechanical, and purity requirements, as well
as  the  corrosive  properties  of  the  UPW  chemistry.
These   requirements   are   defined   by   the   physical
installation   environment,   local   and   national   code
interpretations,   process   requirements,   and   delivery
specifications.
5. 2    System   Installation    The   UP W   system   is
installed    according    to    a    protocol    that    ensures
mechanical  integrity,  leakproof  operation,  and  no  or
minimal  contamination  being  added  from  distribution
throughout the system.
5. 3     Acceptance    Tests     Acceptan ce    tests    are
conducted on each subsystem or system produced. Such
tests     may     include     performance     demonstrations,
demonstrations  of  reliability  criteria,  and  achievement
of   purity   standards.   Such   tests   are   the   basis   for
acceptance  or  rejection  by  the  purchaser  against  a  pre-
negotiated  set  of  criteria  for  the  performance  of  the
system.
5. 4  Qualification Testing  Quali fication testing may
include tests for resistivity, temperature, pressure, TOC,
dissolved  oxygen,  particle  levels,  bacteria,  total  silica,
dissolved silica, non-volatile residue, ions, and metals.
5. 5  Monitoring   UPW  systems  a re  monitored  for
continuing  performance  against  desired  and  achievable
levels  of  quality.  Action  limits  are  generally  set  to
determine   when   system   performance   suggests   that
corrective action is required.
5. 6  UPW specifications  UPW s ystems are generally
guaranteed  to  deliver  a  certain  quality  of  water  on  an
ongoing    basis.    The    guaranteed    performance    is
established  in  advance  between  the  UPW  equipment
manufacturer  and  the  system  owner.  Both  qualification
testing   and   monitoring   testing   use   the   guaranteed
specifications to determine the parameters and levels of
purity to be tested.
5. 7   Recycle/Reclaim  Opportunitie s
 There  can  be
several  opportunities  for  using  water  within  a  UPW
system,  and  should  be  recognized  during  the  design
phase  when  possible.  Examples  are;  use  of  1
st
pass
reject  for  cooling  tower  make-up  water,  returning  UF
reject  to  Primary  or  Feed  water  Tank,  re-use  of  last
stage  rinse  waters  as  UPW  for  lower  grade  use  areas,
i.e.,  CMP,  isolation  of  CMP  waste  stream,  for  possible
reclaim/reuse.
6  Source Water
6. 1   Raw  Water
 is  the  raw  mate rial  from  which
UPW  is  made.    Untreated  raw  water  is  natural  water
that is obtained from a surface source such as a lake or
river, or from a ground water source.  The raw water to
a  UPW  system  is  most  frequently  treated  Municipal
Drinking Water.
6. 2   Municipal  Drinking  Water   Most  natural  raw
waters  must  be  treated  in  order  to  produce  drinking
water that meets federal and state requirements.  There
are   upper   limits   for   inorganic   contaminants   (e.g.,
asbestos, arsenic, copper, and lead), pesticides, volatile
organic   chemicals   (e.g.,   benzene,   trichloroethylene,
toluene,     and     xylene),     turbidity,     microbiological
contaminants,   and   radiological   contaminants   (e.g.,
radon   226,   radon   228,   tritium,   and   strontium   90).
Municipal     Water     Treatment     may     utilize     only
chlorination,  or  filtration  and  chlorination  for  certain
ground water sources. For many surface water sources,
coagulation   (injection   of   aluminum   or   iron   salts),
flocculation    (injection    of    a    long-chain    polymer),
sedimentation,    lime    or    lime/soda    ash    softening,
filtration,  chlorination  or  chloramination  (chlorine  plus
ammonia) and other steps may be required.
7  Major Treatment Processe s
7. 1   Pretreatment  includes  all  of  th e  water  treatment
steps    ahead    of    the    Reverse    Osmosis Membrane
Treatment  step.    These  steps  are  primarily  required  to
protect the membrane units from scaling with sparingly
soluble    salts,    fouling    with    living    or    non-living
suspended    particles,    or    chemical    attack    by    pH,
oxidizing   agents   or   other   dissolved   contaminants.
Pretreatment  equipment  may  include  media  filtration,
micro filtration, or ultrafiltration (bulk suspended solids
removal), 1–5 micron cartridge filtration (polishing step
for   suspended   solids   removal),   sodium-cycle   cation
exchange  (softening,  to  remove  scale-forming  cations),
acid injection (to minimize cellulose acetate membrane
damage   and/or   to   control   carbonate   scales),   scale
inhibitor injection (to control scaling), activated carbon
filtration   (to   remove   oxidizing   agents   and   certain
organic molecules), and sulfite ion injection (to remove
oxidizing agents).
7. 2   Reverse  osmosis  Membrane  T reatment  provides
extremely  high  rejection  of  dissolved  ions  (charged
atoms   and   molecules),   organic   (carbon   containing)
compounds,  silica  (silicon  containing)  compounds,  and
virtually complete rejection of suspended contaminants,
but  will  not  reject  dissolved  gases  and  volatile  organic
compounds  as  well.    Reverse  osmosis  (RO)  units  may</p><p>SEMI F61-0301 © SEMI 20014
be  configured  in  a  double-pass  arrangement  consisting
of  two  RO  membrane  units  in  series.      Permeate
(filtered  water)  from  the  first  RO  unit  is  sent  to  the
second   RO   unit   to   be   filtered   again.      It   is   not
uncommon  for  the  permeate  from  a  double-pass  RO
unit to have a resistivity reading up to 0.5–4 Megohm-
cm,  with  less  than  one  milligram  per  liter  of  organic
and   silica   contaminants.      The   more   contaminants
removed in the membrane treatment step, the lower the
loading on the Polishing steps.
7. 3   Volatiles  Removal   The  rem oval  of  dissolved
oxygen,   carbon   dioxide,   other   gases,   and   volatile
organic  compounds  is  a  necessary  treatment  step.    The
removal of these volatile contaminants is accomplished
to   acceptable   levels   in   vacuum   degasifiers   and   in
membrane    degasification    units.    The    removal    of
volatiles that can form ions and the removal of volatile
organic  compounds  reduce  the  loading  on  downstream
Polishing equipment.
7. 4     Polishing     The    relatively    low     level    of
contaminants  that  were  not  removed  in  the  Membrane
Treatment  and  Volatiles  Removal  steps  are  polished
down to acceptable levels in the Polishing steps.  Ionic,
organic,   and   silica   contaminants   are   removed   in
typically two stages of Ion Exchange in series (primary
beds   and   polishing   beds).      Organic   compounds,
measured  as  TOC  (Total  Organic  Carbon,  or  Total
Oxidizable  Carbon),  that  are  found  downstream  of  the
RO   membrane   units   may   be   subjected   to   TOC
Reduction  ultraviolet  (UV)  irradiation  (185  nanometer
low pressure units or medium pressure units) to convert
most   of   them   into   ionic   compounds   that   can   be
effectively  removed  by  Primary  Ion  Exchange  Units
(usually  consisting  of  Separate  Beds,  Mixed  Beds  or
EDI/CDI/E-Cell).    TOC    compounds    that    exit    the
primary  ion  exchange  units  are  typically  subjected  to
TOC   reducing   UV   irradiation   to   break   them   into
ionized compounds to be removed by the Polishing Ion
Exchange   Units.      The   vast   majority   of   all   living
suspended particles (mainly bacteria) that enter any 254
nm UV unit are inactivated.  Downstream filters with a
pore  size  of  less  than  or  equal  to  0.45  micron  remove
the inactivated bacterial bodies.  The final filter prior to
Distribution  typically  has  a  pore  size  of  less  than  0.2
micron.
8  Distribution
8. 1   Distribution  is  frequently  comp osed  of  one  or
more Loops.      Each   loop   consists   of   UPW   that
continuously  recirculates  through  appropriate  piping
from   the   final   filters,   to   the   manufacturing   areas
requiring  UPW  (end  users),  and  back  to  a  tank  located
within the Polishing  section  to  be  polished  again.    The
UPW  to  the  end-user  area  is  commonly  called  the
Supply.    The  UPW  that  travels  from  the  end-user  area
back to the water treatment area is commonly called the
Return.    Ozone  may  be  injected  into  the  Supply  and/or
Return line to control microbiological contaminants and
also   to   enhance   the   action   of   TOC   breakdown   in
downstream TOC reducing UV units. Sometimes ozone
is  injected  into  the  Supply  line  for  similar  reasons
(requires     de-ozonation     at     the     end-use     points).
Sometimes  the  UPW  in  the  distribution  loop  is  heated
(hot loop) for particular processes.
8. 2  Basic System Components
8. 3  General   Each  UPW  system   contains  certain
basic  components  and  a  variety  of  design  options  to
meet   particular   customer   and   facility   needs.   An
example   of   a   UPW   system   is   shown   in   Figure   1
attached.

14  Procedure
14. 1  Environmental Temperature E ffect
14. 1.1   Install  the  test  specimen  in  the   test  set-up
according  to  the  manufacturer&#x27;s  recommendations,  see
Figure 1a.
14. 1.2   Set  the  environmental  chambe r  temperature
(T
e
)  to  T
min
and  allow  it  to  stabilize  for  one  hour.
Ensure    that    gas    temperature    (T
g
)    and    ambient
temperature  (T
e
)  are  within  2°C  of  each  other  before
beginning data collection.
14. 1.3  Close V
ii
and V
io
, and record t he MFC Q
ind
at a
zero setpoint.
14. 1.4   Open  V
ii
and  V
io
.    Change  the   MFC  flow
setpoints  to  25%,  50%,  75%,  and  100%  of  full  rated
scale.
NOTE 1:  T
g
and T
e
must be within 2°C of each other.
14. 1.5 At  each  setpoint,  record  T
g
,  Q
in d
once,  and    a
minimum  of  10  values  at  a  maximum  of  five  second
intervals  of  T
e
and  Q

GUIDELINES FOR ULTRAPURE WATER USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR
PROCESSING
This   specification   was   technically   approved   by   the   Global   Facilities   Committee   and   is   the   direct
responsibility of the North American Facilities Committee.  Current edition approved by the North American
Facilities Committee on April 30, 2001.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> May 2001; to be published July
2001.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1   This  guide  is  provided  for  mul tiple  purposes.  It
may  be  used  as  a  basis  for  establishing  performance
criteria  for  purchases  of  new  UPW  equipment.  It  may
also  be  used  internally  by  facility  engineers  to  set
process  control  parameters  for  the  operation  of  their
UPW  systems.  This  guide  may  be  used  by  process
engineers to establish reasonable expectations about the
quality of the UPW being supplied to them by facilities.
NOTICE:  These suggested guidelines are published as
technical      information      and      are      intended      for
informational purposes only.
2  Scope</li><li>1   Water  is  used  extensively  in  th e  production  of
semiconductor devices for all wet processing steps such
as  the  rinsing  of  wafers.  Ultrapure  Water  (UPW)  is
typically   produced   for   this   purpose   using   Reverse
Osmosis/Deionized  resin  bed  technologies.  The  quality
of  the  water  impacts  device  yield  and  as  linewidths
decrease,  requirements  for  higher  purity  water  may
increase.</li><li>2   This  standard  does  not  purport   to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.

ASTM  F-1094  —  Test  Method  For  Microbiological
Monitoring of Water Used For Processing Electron and
Microelectronic   Devices   by   Direct-   Pressure   Tap
Sampling  Valve  and  by  the  Pre-sterilized  Plastic  Bag
Method.
4  Limitations
4. 1   This  guide  is  not  intended  to  s et  an  absolute
number  for  performance  of  a  particular  UPW  system.
Performance guidelines should be determined based on
the design of the UPW system, the components used in
the  water  system,  the  sensitivity  of  the  manufacturing
process  to  the  purity  of  the  water,  the  sensitivity  of  the
instrumentation,  and  the  budget  available  to  maintain
and monitor the water system.
4. 2   This  set  of  guidelines  has  been   established  from  a
variety  of  sources  and  inputs  including  1.)  an  industry
survey that SEMI provided to members of its standards
activities  in  facilities;    2.)  typical  UPW  levels  from  a
large  selection  of    semiconductor  UPW  systems  as
measured  by  several  independent  laboratories  that  test
high  purity  water  for  the  semiconductor  industry;  3.)
specifications      from      water      system      equipment
manufacturers;  4.)  and  input  from  producers  and  users
of  UPW  during  SEMI  standards  committee  meetings
and  through  the  balloting  process.  However,  it  is  up  to
each   individual   owner   of   a   UPW   system   to   set
specifications  for  the  purity  of  its  water  based  on  its
own needs and available resources.
4. 3   This  guide  is  reflective  of  a  pa rticular  design
approach  for  a  UPW  system.  The  guidelines  can  be
produced  from  a  properly  maintained  UPW  system  as
described  and  diagrammed  in  SEMI  F61  and  is  typical
output     from     existing     high-end     semiconductor
manufacturing    plants    with    state-of-the-art    water
systems. The purity of water generated in other types of
water systems may differ greatly.
4. 4   The  guidelines  are  targeted  to   UPW  produced  for
semiconductor    manufacturing.  There  exists  an  ASTM
standard  D5127  which  should  be  considered  in  setting
specifications  for  the  purity  of  reagent  grade  water
needed   in   a   laboratory   for   analytical   testing   of
semiconductor materials and process chemicals.</p><p>SEMI F63-0701 © SEMI 20012
5  Use of the Guidelines
5. 1   Sampling  methods  and  contam ination  control  are
of  paramount  importance  when  attempting  to  measure
the listed parameters at the levels specified.
5. 2   The  quality  of  the  data  measur ed  will  depend  on
which  testing  method  and  calibration  techniques  are
used.  Consequently,  trends  observed  in  the  values  may
be more meaningful than absolute values.
6  Units
6. 1   Parts  per  billion  (ppb)  is  equiv alent  to  ng/mL  or
μg/L.
6. 2  Parts per million (ppm) is equi valent to mg/L.
6. 3  Micron is a unit of length equa l to one millionth of
a meter, or one thousandth of a millimeter.
6. 4  Colony Forming Units (CFU)  is a measurement of
bacteria organisms.
7  Description of Parameter  T ests
NOTE  2:  Since  SEMI  Guidelines  do  not  require  analytical

installation into a gas distribution system.  This method
will  quantify  the  effect  of  transient  and  steady  state
inlet and outlet pressure conditions on the performance
of the MFC.</li><li>2    This   document   provides   a   com mon   basis   for
communication    between    manufacturers    and    users
regarding testing and describing MFC pressure effects.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This test method measures the  upstream (inlet) and
downstream  (outlet)  transient  pressure  influences  on
indicated and actual flow.</li><li>2  This test method yields the res ults of actual output
flow   versus   MFC   set-point   and   indicated   flow   as
influenced by steady state inlet pressure.</li><li>3   This  test  method  applies  to  MF Cs  with  maximum
flow ranges of up to 1000 sccm.
NOTE  1:    Due  to  the  higher  sensitivity  of  lower  flow  rate
MFC’s when pressure transients occur, the flow range for this
document is limited to 1000 sccm
.</li><li>4   This  standard  does  not  purport   to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1   This  test  method  is  limited  to  a nalyzing  the  effect
of pressure on performance characteristics of MFCs and
is not a verification of the state of calibration, linearity,
or accuracy.</li><li>2   This  test  method  does  not  addr ess  pressures  in
excess  of  the  DUT’s  maximum  working  pressure  as
specified by the manufacturer.</li><li>3   This  test  method  is  limited  to  r easonable  pressure
transients;  i.e.,  fluctuations  that  are  otherwise  tolerated
by common semiconductor process equipment.</li><li>4   This  test  method  does  not  addr ess  operational
influences   outside   of   the   manufacturer’s   published
limitations.</li><li>5   This  test  method  does  not  addr ess  the  effects  of
interruptions of the gas supply.

7  Interferences
7. 1   The  accuracy  rating  of  the  mea suring  equipment
shall  be  superior  to  that  of  the  DUT.    Preferably  the
measuring equipment will have an accuracy that is four
times better than the DUT.  Calibration equipment must
have a valid calibration certificate.
7. 2   Take  care  when  using  test  inst ruments  with  a
specified accuracy expressed in percent of full scale as
the accuracy is limited at lower percentages.
7. 3    Installation   effects   on   the   flow     should   be
minimized.
7. 4    Verify   electrical   signals   direct ly   at   the   DUT
connector  to  ensure  that  the  signals  at  the  DUT  and
standard  agree  with  the  signals  at  the  data  recording
equipment.
7. 5   All  electrical  measurements  sh ould  be  read  on
devices  with  at  least  4.5  digits  of  resolution.    These
devices must have valid calibration certifications.
7. 6   The  results  of  this  test  method   depend  on  the
accuracy and repeatability of the pressure measurement
devices  used  in  the  test  system.    Take  care  to  stay
within  the  specified  pressure  ranges  of  these  devices
and  verify  their  accuracy  prior  to  and  following  MFC
evaluation activities.
7. 7   The  cleanliness  level  of  the  tes t  gas  should  be
compatible  with  the  DUT.    The  minimum  requirement
placed on the test gas is that it be free of contamination
that  could  influence  the  operational  characteristics  of
the test article and instruments.
7. 8   The  test  gas  source  and  deliver y  system  must  be
capable  of  satisfying  the  test  volume  flow  rate  at  a
constant pressure ± 0.7 kPa (± 0.1 psi).
7. 9   The  ambient  temperature  shou ld  be  held  to  22°C
±2°C for the duration of each analysis.
8  Significance and Use
8. 1  The significance of the stabilit y calculations in this
method is to allow the MFC user to assess the transient
pressure  effects  on  the  DUT.    In  application,  this
method   will   provide   a   consideration   affecting   gas
system designs and MFC selection.
