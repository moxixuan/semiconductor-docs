Since     many     off-the-shelf     component\nsoftware  implementations  support  both  protocols,  it  is\nrelatively   easy   to   design   systems   which   can   be\nconfigured to support either.\n7  Data Format\n7. 1     The    system    should    support    all     minimum\nrequirements  of  SEMI  E5  (SECS-II).    Although  more\nmodern     data     communication     specifications     are\navailable  (e.g.  HTML),  SECS-II  has  unique  aspects\nwhich  are  valuable  in  microelectronics  manufacturing.\nAlso,  there  are  many  available  \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d  software\npackages which provide the SECS-II feature set.\n7. 2    Furthermore,   for   maximum   co mpatibility   and\nreliability, the implementation of any optional SEMI E5\nobjects  (data  items,  variable  items,  messages,  etc.)  on\nthe  system  should  meet  the  requirements  of  SEMI  E5.\nFor  example,  if  an  FPD  system  implements  the  S7,F3\nmessage, it must do so in compliance with SEMI E5 to\nbe  considered  \u201cSECS-II  Compliant\u201d.

This  section  only  applies  to  systems,\nwhich support automated carrier transfer.\n9. 1.2  For compatibility with many a utomated material\nhandling  systems  on  the  factory  floor,  FPD  equipment\nshould  support  all  requirements  for  at  least  one  of  the\nfollowing SEMI carrier transfer parallel I/O standards:\n9. 1.2.1  SEMI  E23  (Cassette  Transfer   Parallel  I/O\nInterface)  \u2014  Note  that  the  diagram  in  SEMI  E23\nshowing  placement  of  the  photo-coupled  I/O  interface\nwith respect to the carrier stage (CS) shows specific CS\nsize  measurements.  However,  this  is  just  an  example\nand not a requirement of SEMI E23. The requirement is\nthat  the  photo  sensor  must  be  on  the  front  edge  of  the\nCS and its center aligned with the center of the CS. This\napplies to a CS of any size.\n9. 1.2.2  SEMI    E84    (Enhanced    Carrier     Handoff\nParallel   I/O   Interface)   \u2014   Note   that   SEMI   E84\nreferences SEMI E1.9, SEMI E15, SEMI E15.1, SEMI\nE47.1, and SEMI E64 which are semiconductor specific\nstandards and not applicable to FPD. However, none of\nthe  requirements  in  these  documents  are  prerequisites\nfor  implementing  SEMI  E84.  SEMI  E84  is  applicable\nto FPD and can be implemented independently.\nNOTICE:      SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or\nrepresentations  as  to  the  suitability  of  the  standard  set\nforth    herein    for    any    particular    application.

(See  Figure  R1-1  1\nst\nPhase).\nThis   means   that   the   discharge   starts   between   the\nelectrode and ground level of discharge circuit through\nthe  stray  capacitance,  and  a  spark  after  dark  current\ntakes  place  in  the  discharge  space  in  the  tube.    In  the\ndischarge, the other electrode is the tube wall (glass or\nfluorescent   substance);   the   formation   of   dielectric\nbarrier  discharge  and  the  existence  of  the  secondary\nelectron  supply  system  to  the  discharge  space  can  be\nconsidered  and  thus  the  discharge  seems  sustainable.\nTherefore,  the  emission  around  the  electrode  is  judged\nto  be  the  emission  mainly  by  negative  glow  of  glow\ndischarge.\nR1-2  From Discharge Starting to Stable\nLighting Mode\nR1-2.1  After   the   discharge   takes   place   near   the\nelectrode  and  the  secondary  voltage  of  the  inverter\nincreases   gradually,   the   emission   area   near   the\nelectrode  grows  longer  accordingly.    (See  Figure  R1-\n2. )  This means that a positive column is generated by\napplied voltage to have such the length as corresponds\nto the value of resistance based on the applied voltage.\nWhen  the  voltage  is  applied  furthermore,  the  emission\narea  (i.e.  positive  column)  between  two  electrodes  is\ngenerated   finally.      (See   Figure   R1-3   2\nnd\nPhase.)\nHowever,  if  the  tube  is  thin  and  long  and  the  stray\ncapacitance is relatively greater to the discharge circuit,\nthe   ratio   of   current   that   flows   through   the   stray\ncapacitance  is  still  large  at  this  phase.    With  the\nincrease  of  the  inverter  secondary  voltage,  the  ratio  of\ncurrent that flows in the tube also increases and most of\nthe current flows in the tube because the impedance of\ndischarge   path   decreases   on   the   contrary   due   to\nnegative characteristics of discharge.  (See Figure R1-4\n3\nrd\nPhase.)\nR1-2.2  Each voltage applied at these three phases may\nbe  called  starting  voltage  at  the  first  phase,  or  stable\ndischarge voltage or tube current at the third phase, for\nexample.  Sometimes it could be hard to distinguish the\nsecond  phase  from  the  third  phase.    In  addition,  since\nthe second phase is hardly observed by the tube designs\n(for the tube length, outer and inner diameters of tube,\npressure  and  composition  of  filler  gas,  and  peripheral\nmembers of tube), it looks as if the first phase shifted to\nthe  third  phase  suddenly.    This  is  because  the  stray\ncapacitance  is  so  big  that  the  current  cannot  flow  into\nthe  tube,  the  discharge  surges  immediately  after  the\ncurrent  flows  into  the  tube,  the  impedance  of  the\ndischarge    path    decreases    due    to    the    negative\ncharacteristics  and  a  large  amount  of  current  flows  in\nthe tube all of a sudden.\nR1-2.3  From the viewpoint of discharge phenomenon,\nthe  voltages  applied  to  the  tube  at  the  first  and  third\nphases are important.  Especially the voltage applied at\nthe  third  phase  should  be  noted  practically.    (The\nvoltage applied at the second phase may be noted also.)\nR1-3  Cautions at Discharge Starting\nR1-3.1  At   the   discharge   starting,   \u03b1   coefficient   of\ndischarge   gas   and   \u03b3   coefficient   of   electrode   are\ninvolved.    These  coefficients  contain  the  pressure  of\ndischarge   gas   (particle   density)   as   a   parameter.\nEspecially when the mercury is filled in, the control of\nambient  temperature  becomes  very  important  because\nthe  mercury  vapor  (particle  density)  pressure  changes\nsensitively to the ambient temperature.\nR1-3.2  In  addition,  the  lighting  circuit  is  usually  built\nfor AC, the reduction of unnecessary stray capacitance\nbase on frequency shall be required.

In  order  to  start  up,  it  is  necessary  to  apply\nan  electric  field,  accelerate  the  initial  electrons,  excite\nand  ionize  gaseous  particles,  and  establish  discharges\n(keep  up  discharges)  in  the  discharge  space.    At  that\nmoment, the initial electrons are said to have relation to\nthe   continuity   of   discharges   at   random,   and   the\ncombinations    of    the    status    of    a    lamp    when\nmanufactured,  history  of  on/off  of  lighting,  various\nfactors  of  a  discharge  lamp,  and  lighting  circuits  are\ninvolved.\nR2-1.2  For  these  reasons,  in  terms  of  the  start-up  of  a\ndischarge  lamp,  initial  electrons  are  required  and  there\nare  probability  factors  to  be  considered,  and  so  the\ndischarge   start-up   time   delay   should   be   observed\nstatistically.\nR2-2  Dark Characteristics of Discharge Lamp\nand Remedy\nR2-2.1  A  discharge  lamp  usually  starts  up  in  a  bright\nplace  even  when  the  initial  electron  source  is  not\nprovided especially.  It is considered that this is because\nthe   external   light   gives   energy   to   materials   (gas,\nelectrode,   etc.)   inside   the   discharge   space   to   emit\nelectrons    (photoelectrons)    as    an    initial    electron.\nHowever,  in  order  to  activate  the  discharge  lamp  in  a\ndark place, the photoelectron cannot be used.  There are\nelectron  sources  such  as  natural  radiation  as  the  other\ninitial electrons (cosmic rays and radian from the earth)\nbut  these  are  not  enough  to  get  initial  electrons  at\npresent.\nR2-2.1.1  Since  the  initial  electrons  in  the  discharge\nspace  in  the  darkness  decrease  greatly,  the  discharge\nstart-up  time  delay,  which  is  from  the  voltage-applied\ntime  to  the  start-up  time,  tends  to  be  salient.    This  is\ndefined as dark characteristics.\nR2-2.2  In  order  to  start  up  a  discharge  lamp  within  a\nlimited  time,  the  method  to  supply  positively  initial\nelectrons in a discharge space is needed.  For example,\nregarding   a   fluorescent   lamp   for   ordinary   lighting\npurpose,  its  negative  electrode  is  preheated  before  the\nstart-up. As a result, thermoelectrons, which are emitted\nfrom  the  emitter  applied  to  the  negative  electrode,  are\nused   as   an   initial   electron.   For   a   glow   starter,\nbremesstrahlung  electrons  by  radioisotope  (RI)  built  in\nthe  electrodes  are  employed.    In  addition,  there  are\nother  methods  such  as  applying  high-voltage  to  supply\nelectrons   from   the   electrodes   (field   emission)   and\nsupplying  photoelectrons  by  turning  on  another  light\nsource  (light  bulb)  located  nearby  a  discharge  lamp\nbefore its start-up.\nR2-2.3  In  terms  of  a  discharge  lamp  used  as  an  LCD\nbacklight,  the  conventional  remedies  have  not  been\nutilized    because    it    must    have    compact    cathode\nelectrodes,    the    RI    is    hardly    used    from    the\nenvironmental  view  point,  the  output  voltage  for  an\ninverter  of  high-frequency  lighting  circuit  is  limited,\nand  the  space  is  too  small  to  built  another  light  source\nin   it.      Thus,   unique   methods   have   been   studied.\nNowadays,  the  followings,  such  as  exposing  a  metal\noxide  that  emits  exoelectrons\n*1\nin  the  discharge  space,\nforming  spattering  layers\n*2\non  the  wall  near  cathode\nelectrodes  by  lighting  a  discharge  lamp  for  a  certain\ntime,  and  making  a  compound  of  materials  with  low\nwork   function\n*3\ninto   electrodes   or   placing   it   near\nelectrodes, are performed.\nR2-3  Theory on Discharge Start-up Time Delay\nR2-3.1  The  equation  on  the  discharge  start-up  time\ndelay is as follows.\n\n\u03c4 = 1/(P\xb7Q)   -----------------------------   (1)\n\nwhere\n\u03c4: average discharge start-up time delay (sec)\nP: percentage of one electron that discharges ( /particle)\nQ: number of initial electrons (particle/sec)\n\nR2-3.2  In  Q  factors  mentioned  before,  such  as  the\nphotoelectrons\n*4\n,   thermoelectrons   by   external   light,\nelectrons emitted by field emission, electrons by natural\nradiation,  electrons  by  RI,  and  exoelectrons,  and  in  P\nfactors, such as the voltage applied to a discharge lamp,\nfiller  gas  pressure,  kind  of  gases,  electrode  materials,\nimpact  of  residual  impure  gases  and  concessionary\nshape of electrode, are involved.\nR2-3.3  Here,  if  a  maximum  value  \u201c1\u201d  is  set  to  P  by\nadjusting a discharge lamp and lighting circuit and if at\nleast  one  particle  of  electron  per  second  exists  in  a\ndischarge  space,  \u03c4  will  be  1  second.    Usually  P  is\nconsidered  to  be  the  order  of  10\n-3.\nIf \u03c4  becomes\napproximately 1 second, the initial electrons with order\nof 10\n3\nparticles per second will be required, and for 0.1\n\n\nSEMI D35-1103\nE\n\xa9 SEMI 2003 10\nsecond, approximately initial electrons with the order of\n10\n4\nparticles per second will be required.\nR2-3.4  Measuring \u03c4  under  various  conditions  helps  us\nto  understand  the  dark  characteristics  and  improve  the\nremedies.\n*1:  When  a  material  emits  electrons,  the  energy\ngreater  than  work  function  must  be  given  to\nelectrons  in  the  material  but  here  the  electrons\nare such energies emitted as low heat and light.\nThe  alpha  alumina  is  said  to  emit  exoelectrons\nand  it  is  actually  used  as  an  initial  electron\nsource  for  a  cold  cathode  lamp.    However,  the\ndetails are still unknown.\n*2:       The    mercury    seems    to    interact    with    the\nspattering   layer   to   create   the   exoelectrons\nsource.\n*3:  The  cesium  (Cs)  and  the  like  with  low  work\nfunction   applied   to   an   electrode   is   used   as\ncompound.\n*4:  The  question  still  remains  if  photoelectrons  can\nbe   supplied   when   energy   more   than   work\nfunction  is  given  to  a  discharge  lamp  material\nby external light (visible light).  The electron by\nexternal  light  may  be  also  considered  as  an\nexoelectron.\n\n\nSEMI D35-1103\nE\n\xa9 SEMI 2003 11\nRELATED INFORMATION 3\nPRECAUTIONS AGAINST MEASURING METHOD OF COLD\nFLUORESCENT LAMP\nNOTICE:  This related information is not an official part of SEMI D35 and was derived from Japan Backlight TF.\nR3-1  Introduction\nR3-1.1  The cold fluorescent lamp (CCFL) is turned on\nusually  by  using  a  compact  DC/AC  convertible  power\nsupply  called  inverter.    The  CCFL  has  been  developed\nwith  top  priorities  such  as  a  narrow  diameter,  space-\nsaving shape and high brightness for its application and\nso the inverter has been requested to have a low profile\nspace-saving shape with high efficiency as well.\nR3-1.2  Understanding  these  requirements  are  satisfied\nand   the   characteristics   such   as   high   voltage,   high\nfrequency  and  micro  current  are  compassable  as  trade-\noff in the CCFL, we should handle it with care.\n\nR3-2  Stray Capacitance and Leakage Current\nR3-2.1  Stray Capacitance\nR3-2.1.1  The    stray    capacitance    is    defined    as    a\ncharacteristic  that  behaves  as  if  it  had  the  electrostatic\ncapacity that system does not provide and its volume is\ntoo     unstable     to     be     measured     quantitatively\n(unintentional   electrostatic   capacity   element).      If   a\nformula  for  electrostatic  capacity  between  two  parallel\ncopper  wires  is  put  into  an  equation,  it  will  be  nearly\nexpressed as follows;\n\nC = Q/V = (\u03c0\u03b50)/(log ((d\u2212a)/a) ------ (1)\nwhere\nC: electrostatic capacity (stray capacitance)\nd: distance between wires\na: diameter of wire\n\nR3-2.1.2  According  to  the  above-mentioned  equation\n(1),  it  is  understood  that  the  stray  capacitance  does  not\naffect  the  frequency  but  is  inversely  proportional  to\nlogarithm  of  the  distance  between  wires.    (This  means\nthat  the  closer  the  distance  between  high  potentials\nbecomes, the more the stray capacitance increases, and\nthe  longer  the  wire  becomes,  the  stray  capacitance\nincreases as well.)\nR3-2.2  Leakage Current\nR3-2.2.1  The  leakage  current  is  the  inverter  secondary\ncurrent   that   flows   to   the   above-mentioned   stray\ncapacitance.  (It equal to the inverter secondary current\nexcept  for  that  of  CCFL.)    Suppose  \u201cC\u201d  is  the  stray\ncapacitance  around  CCFL  and  \u201cI\u201d  is  the  current  that\nflows  to  \u201cC\u201d  and  sinusoidal  AC  voltage  is  applied,  the\nbellow-equation is obtained.\n\nI = \u03c9\xb7C\xb7V = 2\u03c0f\xb7C\xb7V ------ (2)\nwhere\nI: leakage current (true AC current)\nf: AC frequency\nC: stray capacitance (electrostatic capacity)\nV: tube voltage (true AC voltage)\n\nR3-2.2.2  According  to  the  above-mentioned  equation\n(2),  the  leakage  current  increases  proportionally  to  the\nincrease   of   the   frequency,   stray   capacitance,   or\npotential difference.\nR3-2.2.3  Since   the   stray   capacitance   and   leakage\ncurrent  increase  or  decrease  by  each  parameter  such  as\nthe  length  of  high  voltage  wire,  distance  between  the\nwire  and  the  conductor  of  ground,  lighting  frequency\nand   potential   difference,   it   is   recommended   that\nmeasuring    conditions    should    be    specified    and\nstandardized as much as possible.\nR3-3  Temperature Characteristics\nR3-3.1  The   CCFL   is   quite   sensitive   to   mercury\ntemperature   characteristics   because   its   fluorescent\nsubstance  emits  light  receiving  ultraviolet  rays  from\nmercury particles as activation energy.\nR3-3.2  If   the   temperature   of   mercury   particles   is\nregarded  as  the  same  as  the  CCFL  wall  temperature\nwhen  lighting,  and  suppose  the  tube  temperature  is\n25\xb0C   at   0\xb0C   of   ambient   temperature   against   wall\ntemperature  at  50\xb0C,  approximately  1/10  of  saturated\nsteam  pressure  difference  will  take  place  and  actual\nluminance  of  the  tube  will  be  approximately  1/2.    On\nthe  contrary  for  the  high  temperature  side,  suppose  the\nwall    temperature    is    100\xb0C    against    the    ambient\ntemperature  70\xb0C  the  steam  pressure  difference  which\nis greater by 20 times will take place and the actual tube\nluminance is approximately 2/3.\nR3-3.3  In   this   manner,   the   temperature   and   tube\nluminance  have  peak  characteristics  within  a  certain\ntemperature  range  because  the  partial  pressures  of  Ar,\nNe  and  Hg  have  the  optimum  density  against  the\nlighting tube current.  When the temperature is low, the\nluminance decreases due to the lack of absolute amount\nof   ultraviolet   rays   caused   by   insufficient   mercury\nmolecules.\n\n\nSEMI D35-1103\nE\n\xa9 SEMI 2003 12\nR3-3.4  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  temperature  is\nhigh,    the    mercury    molecule    density    goes    up\ndramatically,    reabsorption    of    ultraviolet    rays    by\nmercury  itself  takes  place,  the  amount  of  ultraviolet\nrays  that  reach  the  fluorescent  substance  decreases  and\nso  the  luminance  decreases  accordingly.    The  further\nattention necessary is that the mass (thickness) of glass\ntube is made as thin as possible because the CCFL has\nbeen  developed  with  such  top  priority  as  to  have  the\nnarrow    diameter,    space-saving    shape    and    high\nluminance.    For  this  reason,  the  heat  capacity  is  very\nsmall,   which   means   the   inside   mercury   molecule\ntemperature  will  be  affected  greatly  by  heat  transfer\ncaused  by  interference  with  surrounding  members  and\ncooling effect of convective wind to the glass.\nR3-3.5  Since the luminance varies due to the impact to\nthe  glass  temperature  by  each  parameter  such  as  the\ninterference  of  surrounding  members,  contact  of  other\nmaterials  and  cooling  effect  of  convective  wind,  it  is\nrecommended   that   measuring   conditions   should   be\nspecified and standardized as much as possible.\n\nTem p. vs M ercury vapor\n0. 0001\n0. 001\n0. 01\n0. 1\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n0       100      200      300      400\nTe mp.

Since  the  starting  point  of  main\ndischarge  may  vary  by  the  slide-up  speed,  a  special\nattention should be paid.\nR3-4.2  When  the  slide-up  speed  is  so  slow  that  the\nratio  of  partial  pressure  of  Ar,  Ne  and  Hg  shifts  to  the\ncondition  where  lighting  is  easily  performed  because\nthe   mercury   vapor   pressure   increases   by   the   heat\ngeneration  caused  by  half-lighting,  the  main  discharge\nmay  begin  easily  compared  to  the  condition  at  low\nCCFL temperature.\nR3-4.3  Therefore,  when  measuring  the  CCFL,  these\nconditions   should   be   specified   and   standardized   as\nmuch as possible.\nR3-5  Use of Master CCFL\nR3-5.1  When  interrelating  the  spectroradiometer  and\ncolorimeter,  an  actual  CCFL  is  used  often  as  a  master\nCCFL.\nPrecautions for such cases are\n1) the registration date, production history, lighting\nhistory  and  expiring  date  of  the  master  CCFL\nshould be specified and attached to it, and\n2) the master CCFL should be kept such that there\nshall    be    no    impact    to    reproduction    of\nmeasurement.\nR3-5.2  Since  this  document  is  positioned  as  a  related\ndocument  to  standardized  documents,  the  contents  are\ntreated as \u201cjust for information\u201d.\nNOTICE: SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or\nrepresentations  as  to  the  suitability  of  the  standards  set\nforth    herein    for    any    particular    application.
