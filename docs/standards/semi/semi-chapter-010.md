Theend connection fittings of each DUT being compared must be of the same type.8.13 Metal Gaskets  New gaskets should be used for each new connection.8.14 Mechanical Shock Device  To provide mechanical shock by impact to the test device. (See Figure 4.)8.15 Instrumentation  Condensation nucleus counter (CNC) or laser particle counter (LPC) to collect particlecount data.8.16 Isokinetic Sampler (IKS)  A static device used to collect a representative sample that is not influenced byflow characteristics and/or particle size (see Figure 3). Other designs of isokinetic samplers are permitted as long asthey collect a representative sample of the flow. Figure 4Mechanical Shock Test DeviceNOTE: Position the delivery ramp so that the position of impact is at the midpoint of the axial centerline of the device under test. 9 Sampling, Test Specimens, and Test Units9.1 MFCs regulate flows greater than or less than the flow requirements of particle counters; therefore, twodifferent sampling techniques have been defined, isokinetic sampling and direct sampling.9.1.1 Direct Sampling  The direct sampling method is used when the test flow is less than or equal to the sampleflow. (See Figure 1.)9.1.1.1 In this case, gas exiting the DUT is introduced directly into the CNC. A tee, equipped with a filtered branch,is inserted between the DUT and the CNC to provide make-up flow to the CNC. The volume and overall length ofthe tubing connecting the DUT to the tee assembly should be minimized.

SEMI E66-1103 © SEMI 1997, 2003 6 9.1.2 Isokinetic Sampling  Isokinetic sampling isused when the test flow is greater than the sample flow.(See Figure 2.)NOTE 1: An alternative size IKS may be substituted for theIKS described in Sections 9.1.2.1 through 9.1.2.7 as long as itcollects a representative sample of particles that is notinfluenced by flow characteristics and/or particle size.9.1.2.1 Select the appropriate IKS (see Figure 3) fromTable 1 for the test flow. This is the smallest IKS thatexceeds the flow of the DUT.9.1.2.2 The average velocity of the gas through thesampling probe shall approximate the average velocityin the tubing in which the sampling probe is inserted.The sample flow used to calculate the sampling probediameter is the total flow drawn by the counter.9.1.2.3 The tip of the sampling probe is to have a 30\_taper on the outside diameter.9.1.2.4 The pick-off point is to be centered within theflow stream.9.1.2.5 The pick-off point is to be at a minimumdistance of 15 diameters of the primary flow tubeupstream or downstream from any connection.9.1.2.6 Flow stability within the isokinetic sampler ismaintained by the bypass MFC.9.1.2.7 To determine the dimensions of the isokineticsampler, as shown in Table 1, the following equationsand conditions are used: 10 Preparation of Apparatus10.1 Setup and Schematic for Direct Sampling  SeeFigure 1.10.1.1 Install the spool piece between points A and B.10.1.2 Set nominal supply pressure to 308.10 kPa (30psig).10.1.3 Cycle the supply MFC, switching between a lowflow and maximum purge flow as quickly as isreasonably possible. Cycle every five seconds for atleast 30 minutes. The maximum purge flow should beas high as possible and no less than twice the test rate.During this initial cleanup, the particle counter shouldbe off-line. 10.1.4 Moisture from an inboard leak can causeparticle counts on some particle counters.

Test thesystem for leak integrity per SEMI F1  SubsystemsInboard Leak Test.10.3 Select the appropriate isokinetic sampler based onthe maximum test flow of the DUT, using Table 1 andFigure 3. The size of the sampler should be equal to orgreater than the maximum test flow. 11 Calibration and Reference Standards11.1 Calibrate instruments regularly according to themanufacturers recommendations. 12 Test ProcedureThe test apparatus is to be enclosed in a Class 100environment (in accordance with ISO 14644). Testmust be performed in the sequence described below.(See Figures 5 and 6.)Measure DUT in purge mode to determine flow or usethe value supplied by the manufacturer. This willdetermine which apparatus to use, direct sampling(Figure 1) or IKS (Figure 2). Both of the test apparatusmay be required for testing a wide range of flowcontrollers.

A2-1A2-1.1 The background and DUT are expected to have low particle counts. Therefore, a statistical method is neededto determine if there is a difference between background and DUT particle counts. The t-test is a method ofdetermining the actual statistical difference between the mean background particle count and the mean deviceparticle count. It can be used to characterize the particle contribution by the MFC Record results in Table A2-1.Table A2-1 Test Worksheet# Observation log Observation RemarksSpool Cleanup 1 ...

A2-2 InterpretationA2-2.1 If |t| &gt; t.975, then the two means are significantly different at the 95% level. If |t| &gt; t .995, then the two meansare significantly different at the 99% level (e.g., by 95% confidence, it is meant that the difference/no-differencedecision based on the t-test will be correct 95% of the time).t.975 = 2.145 (2-sided)t.995 = 2.977 (2-sided)NOTE: All readings are log particle counts, not particle counts.

Originally published September 1997.1 Purpose1.1 This document describes a method to helpdetermine the ability of an MFC to meet themanufacturers published specifications over its lifetime. The results of the test will also be useful in thecomparison of MFCs. 2 Scope2.1 This procedure applies to MFCs used insemiconductor gas systems.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This procedure is to be used only in conjunctionwith another existing parametric test for mass flowcontrollers to obtain the reliability data for thatparticular parametric test.3.2 New MFCs shall be used for reliability testing. AnMFC that has been put through this test method may betested for reliability again.3.3 In addition to this procedure, the parametric testmay also cycle the valve. These cycles should beignored for determining the cumulative cycles that aredescribed in the data table.3.4 This test will not address root cause analysis offailures.3.5 Read points have been selected for this testprocedure so that the test will take approximately sixmonths to complete. The read point schedule given isonly a suggested schedule and if the user feels that adifferent read point schedule would better suit hisneeds, this test method can still be used to obtainreliability data. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E17  Guideline for Mass Flow ControllerTransient Characteristics TestsSEMI E66  Test Method for Determining ParticleContribution by Mass Flow ControllersSEMI E69  Test Method for DeterminingReproducibility and Zero Drift for Thermal Mass FlowControllersSEMI F1  Specification for Leak Integrity of High-Purity Gas Piping Systems and Components4.2 SEMASPECs1 NOTE 1: The SEMASPECs noted here will be superceded bythe comparable SEMI documents when available.90120391B-STD  SEMATECH Test Method for theDetermination of the Helium Leak Rate for GasDistribution System Components92071220B-STD  SEMATECH Guide to ProvisionalTest Methods for Mass Flow Controllers4.3 Other DocumentNelson, Wayne, Applied Life Data Analysis, NewYork, NY Wiley, 1982 (see Annex)NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Acronyms and Abbreviations5.1.1 MFC  Mass flow controller5.1.2 UHP  Ultra-high purity5.2 Definitions5.2.1 cycle  a repeating sequence of setpoints appliedto the MFC.5.2.2 hard failure  a catastrophic mechanical failureor electrical failure that results in an inoperable MFC, 1 SEMATECH, 2706 Montopolis Drive, Austin, TX 78741, USAwebsite: www.sematech.org.

Whenthe number of cycles specified in the readpoint scheduleis reached, cycling is suspended, parametric tests areper-formed, and the cycling is resumed until either thenext readpoint is reached, or the MFC experiences ahard failure. After the cycling is completed, theparametric test data is analyzed to determine thereliability of each parameter. 7 Significance and Use7.1 This test provides an estimate of the reliability of amass flow controller. The results of the test will also beuseful in the comparison of MFCs. The data providedby this test can help end users determine the reliabilityof equipment that uses MFCs.7.2 The following parameters and associated testmethods should be tested with this test method to obtainreliability data: Parameter Test MethodParticle Contribution SEMI E66Reproducibility & Zero Drift SEMI E69Helium Leak Rate SEMASPEC90120391B-STDStep Response SEMI E17 7.3 The following modifications to the preceding para-metric test methods are suggested to abbreviate the timerequired to complete the reliability test:7.3.1 SEMI E66 (Particle Contribution)  Abbreviatethis test method to perform only the dynamic controlmode test. Perform Sections 12.1.3 and 12.1.7, andeliminate Sections 12.1.2, 12.1.4, 12.1.5, 12.1.6, 12.1.8,12.1.9, and 12.1.10. Refer to Sections 5.2.1 (Background), 5.2.3 (Dynamic), and Figure 5 (ParticleTest Flow Chart).7.3.2 SEMI E69 (Reproducibility & Zero Drift) Omit Sections 12.1 and 12.2.7.3.3 SEMI F1 (Leak Integrity)  The intent of thereliability test method is to detect the development ofgross leaks in the DUT due to cycling of the DUTvalve. The inboard component leak test portion of thisstandard should be performed.7.3.4 SEMI E17 (Step Response)  No abbreviation isnecessary for this test. However, perform this test withthe modifications noted in the SEMATECH Guide toProvisional Test Methods for Mass Flow Controllers,SEMASPEC 92071220B-STD.7.4 Change in the performance characteristics of theMFC, as measured by the above tests, may also bemonitored and analyzed as indicative of drift. 8 Apparatus8.1 In addition to the apparatus listed below, the usermust also acquire any apparatus required to perform theparametric test for which reliability data is needed.

(Seedocuments cited in Section 7.2.) Since reliability datafor leak integrity is being sought, helium cannot be usedduring the cycling procedure.9.1.1 Source of nitrogen (99.999%) 10 Sampling, Test Specimens, and Test Units10.1 Three MFCs are required for meaningful dataanalysis. However, 20 to 30 MFCs are a recommendedminimum. A larger sample size provides a more preciseestimate of reliability.

Two types of cycles are applied to the MFC to simulate morerealistically the MFCs field environment. Alternate between the two types of cycles as illustrated in Figure 2.Maintain each setpoint for a fixed period of time. Use one of the following times based upon the settling time of theslowest DUT. If the settling time is less than or equal to 1.25 seconds, use a time period of 2.5 seconds. If thesettling time is less than or equal to 2.5 seconds and greater than 1.25 seconds, use a time period of 5 seconds. If thesettling time is greater than 2.5 seconds, use a time period of twice the settling time.

Ifany MFC experiences a soft failure, record the data butdo not stop the cycling procedure. However, if an MFCexperiences a hard failure, record the data, discontinuetesting this MFC, and take appropriate action tomaintain system integrity.NOTE 2: The test does not require mention of the cause forhard failure, as it is beyond the scope of this document.14.5 The parametric tests should be performed in thefollowing order: particle, accuracy, response, and leak.14.6 Perform all of the parametric tests on a singleMFC before proceeding to the next one. Record theorder of the MFCs tested and the time since the teststand was idled.14.7 If the readpoint is reached during a time when it isnot possible to start the parametric testing, continuecycling until it is possible to begin. Record the numberof cycles that occurred before beginning testing.14.8 Average the particle count information over a 10-minute interval. Count particles for six 10-minute intervals. Record the data from only the last three 10-minute intervals.14.9 Repeat Sections 14.4 through 14.8 until all thereadpoints have been completed or until all MFCs haveexperienced hard failures. 15 Data Analysis15.1 Calculations  See Appendix 1 for a discussionon reliability calculation.15.2 Interpretation of Results  The readpointsincluded in Table 1 are approximately equidistant on alog scale, and as data is collected, the number ofreadpoints needed to show trends and estimate life willdecrease significantly. 16 Data Presentation16.1 Plot each performance measure over number ofcycles to look for trends and shifts as a function of use(see Figure 3). This gives a picture of dynamicperformance vs. use.

SEMI E67-0304 © SEMI 1997, 2004 8 APPENDIX 1RELIABILITY ANALYSIS NOTICE: This appendix was approved as an official part of SEMI E67 by full letter ballot procedure.NOTE 1: The method for reliability analysis provided herein is one of many possible methods which may be used. It is up to theuser to determine if this method or another (e.g., Weibull) is to be used for determination of MFC reliability. A1-1 Reliability AnalysisA1-1.1 Almost all reliability studies of entities whose failure is unplanned, focus on the time until a smallpercentage has failed (time until 10% of the population has failed, for example). Focus is on the left tail of the time-to-failure probability distribution. Nelsons book, Applied Life Data Analysis, (Wiley, 1982) gives a simple methodfor estimating the time to 10% failure for a lognormal distribution (n = 2 to 10) from units put on test. Table A1(from page 272 of Nelsons book) can be used as follows:A1-1.1.1 Calculate the % failed from the following equation:Plot % failed vs. # cycles to failure for each MFC that failed on lognormal probability paper (see Figure 4).A1-1.1.2 Estimate the mean, \*, and the standard deviation, \*, from the plot with the following equations:A1-1.1.3 Calculate a 90% lower confidence limit for the (log of) 10% failure percentile (y 10, lcl) from the followingequations: y\* = LOG (y10, lcl ) = \* + t \* \[ = 0.10, P = 0.10, n =# tested, r =# failed\]  \* where t \* is found from Applied Life Data Analysis, Table A1 y 10, lcl = 10y \* A1-1.1.4 Here is a sample set of data to illustrate the procedure. i Cycles to Failure % Failed1 6.3 K 8.32 15.8 K 25.03 25.1 K 41.74 40 K 58.35 63 K 75.06 did not fail did not failThe % failed column was calculated from the equation in Section A1-1.1.1.

SEMI E68-0997 © SEMI 1997, 20031 SEMI E68-0997 (Reapproved 1103)TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING WARM-UP TIME OF MASS FLOWCONTROLLERS This test method was technically reapproved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on July 27, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org October 2003; to be publishedNovember 2003. Originally published September 1997. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this method is to provide astandardized method for quantifying the warm-up timeof an MFC.NOTE 1: Warm-up times affect the initial performance of amass flow controller (MFC). Warm-up time is necessaryinformation in deciding if a process tool is ready to be putback into service. In addition, warm-up data will be useful incalibration labs. 2 Scope2.1 The test conditions in this method are intended tosimulate bench top warm-up, with an MFC that hasbeen equalized to ambient conditions for 24 hoursbefore the application of power.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Conditions in the lab may be different fromconditions found in the field and may influence testresults. This test is intended to measure warm-up undera controlled condition.3.2 The MFC is to be at ambient temperature beforethe beginning of the test.3.3 Due to manufacturing variability, warm-up timesmay vary for the same model of MFC. Thisspecification addresses a method for taking a singledata point repetitively from the same MFC. Resultingdata will show exactly how warm-up effects change thedelivered flow of that particular MFC. To statisticallyquantify warm-up time for a particular model of MFC,multiple samples should be tested. 4 Referenced DocumentsNone. 5 Terminology5.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms5.1.1 DUT  Device under test5.1.2 FS  Full scale5.1.3 MFC  Mass flow controller5.2 Definitions5.2.1 device under test  the MFC being tested forwarm-up time.5.2.2 indicated flow  flow indicated by the MFCunder test. Electrical output of the DUT.5.2.3 stability  a condition that exhibits only natural,random variations in the absence of unnatural,assignable-cause variations. For the several purposes ofthis test, stability is defined as ±10% of the accuracy ofthe DUT at full scale.5.2.4 steady state  state at which the indicated flowis stable for a 15-minute time period.5.2.5 warm-up  a process where the MFC goes froman unpowered condition to a condition where the outputis within ±1% full scale, of the final steady state output. 6 Summary of Test Method6.1 The DUT is connected in series with shut-offvalves on either side of the DUT. With no gas flow andthe DUT powered, indicated flow is monitored untilsteady state is achieved. Power is briefly disconnectedthen reconnected and indicated flow is again monitoreduntil steady state is achieved. 7 Significance and Use7.1 Data generated by this method is used to estimatethe amount of time an MFC should be powered up in aprocess tool before resuming production. Whencalibrating an MFC, the warm-up time can be used toestimate the waiting time before calibration. For powerinterruptions, the power interruption warm-up time maybe used to determine the time required following apower interruption to resume production or calibration.

Time-keepingrequirements are not stringent, and almost any apparatus is acceptable.8.3 Data Acquisition System  Having a resolution of one mV or better and a sample rate of one Hz. 9 Conditioning9.1 Ambient temperature must be controlled and stable between 20°C and 25°C during testing for all tests. TheDUT must be exposed to the ambient environment for 24 hours before the beginning of the test so that it is inequilibrium. The gas temperature must be measured and verified to be at equilibrium with both the DUT and withambient temperature. Temperatures are in equilibrium if they are within 1°C of each other. Lab temperature may notchange more than 1°C during test. 10 Procedure10.1 Connect the DUT in series with the two shut-off valves, one upstream of the DUT and the other downstream.Electronically connect the DUT to a data acquisition system capable of recording indicated flow from the DUT. Thetest set-up should be set to give appropriate signals to the DUT so the DUT control valve will not dissipate power.For normally closed MFCs, the setpoint should be zero, and for normally open MFCs, the setpoint should be100%. Suggested orientation of the DUT is horizontal (base down). If the DUT is positioned otherwise, theorientation should be reported in the test data (see Figure 1). Valves are to be opened in a downstream-to-upstreamsequence and closed in reverse fashion. The data acquisition system must be warmed up as per the manufacturersinstructions.10.2 Close shut-off valves.10.3 In Table 1, record the time of day when power was applied to the DUT. Begin recording the indicated flowfrom the DUT at one sample per second.

Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on July 27, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org October 2003; to be published November2003. Originally published February 1998. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this document is to provide astandardized method to quantify the reproducibility andzero drift of a thermal mass flow controller.1.2 The intent of this document is not to suggest anyspecific testing program but to specify the test methodto be used when testing for parameters that are coveredby this method. The user might use this document tocheck significant performance characteristics, such asreproducibility and zero drift, under a set of closelycontrolled test conditions.1.3 The significance of the accuracy calculations in thismethod is to allow an MFC user to transfer a processfrom one manufacturing tool to another and toexchange MFCs within a single manufacturing toolwhile maintaining process control. 2 Scope2.1 This document describes the conditions andprocedures for testing the reproducibility and zero driftof thermal mass flow controllers (MFCs). Because ofthe generic nature of this document, not all testprocedures apply to all types of MFCs.2.2 This document provides a common basis forcommunication between manufacturers and users.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 It is not practical to evaluate performance under allpossible combinations of operating conditions. This testprocedure should be applied under laboratoryconditions; its intent is to collect sufficient data to forma judgement of the field performance of the MFC beingtested. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardSEMI E28  Guideline for Pressure Specifications ofthe Mass Flow Controller4.2 ANSI Standards1 ANSI C39.5  Safety Requirements for Electrical andElectronic Measuring and Controlling InstrumentationANSI C42.100  Dictionary of Electrical andElectronics TermsANSI MC4.1  Dynamic Response Testing of ProcessControl Instrumentation4.3 ASME Document2 ASME MFC-1M  Glossary of Terms Used in theMeasurement of Fluid Flow in Pipes4.4 IEC Standards3 IEC 160  Standard Atmospheric Conditions for TestPurposesIEC 546  Methods of Evaluating the Performance ofControllers with Analogue \[sic\] Signals for Use inIndustrial Process Control4.5 ISA Documents4 ISA S7.3  Quality Standards for Instrument AirISA S51.1  Process Instrumentation TerminologyANSI/ISA-1 979 (reaffirmed 1993) 1 American National Standards Institute, Headquarters: 1819 LStreet, NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA.

SEMI E69-0298 © SEMI 1998, 20035 7 Interferences7.1 The accuracy rating of the measuring equipmentmust include superior measurement capabilitycompared with that of the DUT. In no instance shouldthe accuracy rating of the measuring equipment be lessthan twice that of the DUT (e.g., if the accuracy of theDUT is ± 1 sccm, then the accuracy of the measuringdevice must be better than, or equal to, ± 1/2 sccm).The traceability of all the pertinent measuringinstruments and devices should be realisticallyestablished and quantified.7.1.1 In addition, take care when using test instrumentswith a specified accuracy expressed in percent of fullscale. For example, if an instrument with a specifiedaccuracy of ± 0.1% of full scale is used to measure theoutput of the DUT, but this output signal falls onlywithin the lower third of the scale of the instrument, theeffective accuracy over the range of the instrumentbeing used may be ± 0.3%, which is unsuitable formany applications.7.1.2 Use special precautions to ensure that minimumeffects result from pneumatic noise in flow lines.Monitor pressure both upstream and downstream of theMFC to ensure that pneumatic noise is minimized.7.1.3 The DUT should be installed so that the inletflow can be fully developed, pulsation-free, for thespecific conditions. This can be achieved by plumbing astraight length of tubing 4050 diameters long upstreamand another straight length 5 diameters longdownstream of the DUT. (For additional informationabout inlet effects, refer to ASME MFC-1M.)7.1.4 At regular calibration intervals, verify electricalsignals directly at the MFC connector to ensure thatthere are no unacceptable line losses in the cables. 8 Apparatus8.1 back pressure regulator8.2 digital voltmeter 8.3 flow standard8.4 heat exchanger8.5 power supply8.6 pressure transducer8.7 setpoint generator8.8 temperature probe 9 Precautions9.1 Technical Precautions9.1.1 Many analog-to-digital converter cards do notdifferentiate between measurements of less than zeroand zero. It may be necessary to use a digital voltmeterto record measurements below zero volts. Some MFCsdo not differentiate between measurements of less thanzero and zero. This may bias the results.9.1.2 The manufacturers specifications andinstructions for installation and operation must beapplied during all testing.9.1.3 All electrical measurements should be read ondevices with at least 4.5 digits of resolution. Thesedevices must have valid calibration certifications.9.1.4 The mounting position of the device must be inaccordance with the manufacturers specifications. Noexternal mechanical constraints beyond themanufacturers recommended mounting position shallbe permitted. 10 Preparation of Apparatus10.1 Figure 3 is a representation of a recommendedgeneric testing apparatus. The flow standard is showndownstream of the device under test (DUT). It may beplaced upstream of the DUT if the flow standard cannotbe exposed to a low pressure environment. In this case,the user should be aware of possible back pressureeffects on the flow standard.

SEMI E72-0600 © SEMI 1998, 20051 SEMI E72-0600 (Reapproved 0305)SPECIFICATION AND GUIDE FOR 300 mm EQUIPMENT FOOTPRINT,HEIGHT, AND WEIGHT This specification was technically approved by the Global Physical Interfaces & Carriers Committee and isthe direct responsibility of the North American Physical Interfaces & Carriers Committee. Current editionapproved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on December 10, 2004. Initially availableat www.semi.org February 2005; to be published March 2005. Originally published in 1998, previouslypublished June 2000. 1 Purpose1.1 Currently, device manufacturers cannot easily plan or retrofit their fabs, because equipment volumes are notpredictable. Similarly, equipment suppliers cannot predict fab designs, because there are too many configurations. Ingeneral, fab space is not used efficiently, and there seems to be a trade-off between space efficiency andmaintainability. This standard is a guide for equipment design and a specification for maximum limits on equipmentvolume and weight. 2 Scope2.1 This standard specifies limits on the footprint, height, and weight of equipment for 300 mm fabs. Separate limitsare given for the parts of the equipment in the main fab and in the sub-fab. Separate limits are also given for theequipment after it is installed and for the components of the equipment as it is moved into the fab. The actualfootprint may vary by equipment type.2.2 This standard is intended to set an appropriate level of specification that places minimal limits on supplierinnovation while ensuring opportunities for users to be globally (though possibly not locally) efficient withequipment volumes.2.3 This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility ofthe users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability ofregulatory limitations prior to use.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E15  Specification for Tool Load PortSEMI E15.1  Specification for 300 mm Tool Load PortNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions. 4 Terminology4.1 Definitions4.1.1 cost footprint  the area (A) of the smallest horizontal rectangle that contains all of the shadow footprint andhalf of the easement space around the equipment (for use as the floor space metric in Cost of Ownershipcalculations). As shown in Figure 1, this is computed asA = \[Wt +  (Ws  Wt)\]  \[Dt +  (Ds  Dt)\]=  (Wt + Ws)  (Dt + Ds)Where W represents width and D represents depth

&lt;!-- Page 50 --&gt;

SEMI E72-0600 © SEMI 2003 2 4.1.2 depth  the horizontal dimension perpendicular to the load face plane.4.1.3 easement space  the floor space that must remain clear to the rear and sides of the equipment (but not infront of the load face plane). This includes safety aisles, ergonomic maintenance access space, component removalspace, and room for doors to swing out (see Figure 1).4.1.4 load face plane  the furthest physical vertical boundary plane from the cassette centroid or carrier centroidon the side (or sides) of the tool where loading of the tool is intended (as defined in SEMI E15).4.1.5 shadow footprint  the area of the floor space directly under every part of the equipment during its operation(see Figure 1). This includes any temporary projections from the equipment during loading or processing (such ascarriers that stick out from the equipment or equipment load ports that protrude only when the equipment is beingloaded).4.1.6 width  the horizontal dimension parallel to the load face plane. 5 Requirements and RecommendationsNOTE 1: The dimensions cited in the following sections are specified in Table 1.5.1 Sub-Fab vs. Main Fab Footprint5.1.1 Requirements  Both the cost footprint and the shadow footprint of the remote parts of any equipment in thesub-fab must be less than or equal to the cost footprint and the shadow footprint (respectively) of the parts of thatequipment in the main fab (the cleanroom including both bays and chases, if any). Furthermore, the remote parts ofthe equipment in the sub-fab must be capable of being installed so that the rectangle defining the cost footprint in thesub-fab is entirely underneath the rectangle defining the cost footprint in the main fab. In some fab designs (such asslab on grade), there is no sub-fab (or basement). In such cases, these requirements apply to the remote parts of theequipment in whichever equipment support area contains the same remote parts of the equipment as a sub-fab. Also,some fabs have multiple sub-fab levels. In such cases, these requirements apply to the remote parts of the equipmentin all sub-fab levels.5.1.2 Recommendations  Since the sub-fab is likely to have more columns than the main fab, it is recommendedthat the remote parts of the equipment in the sub-fab come in modules that can be arranged to accommodate avariety of layouts.5.2 Equipment Height5.2.1 Requirements  The maximum height of any equipment (other than a stocker) must be less than or equal to Hin the main fab and Hs in the sub-fab. Any connections for utilities and required overhead mainten-ance access mustalso be included within these limits. These limits also apply during installation, so if a part of the equipment must berotated up into place, the diagonal measurement must be less than these limits.5.2.2 Recommendations  Thus, equipment suppliers are advised to not plan on ceilings higher than these limits.5.3 Floor Loading5.3.1 Requirements  The maximum mass of any equipment in the main fab divided by its shadow footprint mustbe less than or equal to M (except when support pedestals are used). Furthermore, the maximum weight on any 0.6m by 0.6 m (2 ft. by 2 ft.) floor tile (in any installation configuration) must be less than or equal to Mt. These limitsalso apply when the equipment is being moved into the fab and installed, unless spreader plates are used.5.3.2 Recommendations  It is recommended that seismic loading also be considered when designing equipmentweight distribution.5.4 Move-In-Size5.4.1 Requirements  To clarify the size of the doors and hallways needed in the fab, this paragraph specifies thesize of the equipment's components after it has been uncrated, while it is being moved into the fab, and before it isinstalled. All parts of the equipment destined for the main fab must come in packages that are no taller than Z andthat are smaller than X by Y in two orthogonal horizontal dimensions. All parts of the equipment destined for thesub-fab must come in packages that are no taller than Zs and that are smaller than Xs by Ys in two orthogonal
