SEMI G61-94 © SEMI 1994 2 3 Definition of Terms3.1 blister (bubble) ceramic  an enclosed, localizedseparation within or between the layers of a ceramicpackage that does not expose an underlying layer ofceramic or metallization.3.2 blister (bubble) metallization  an enclosed,localized separation of a metallization layer from itsbase material (such as ceramic or another metal layer)that does not expose the underlying layer.3.3 braze  in semiconductor pac kages, an alloy usedto attach pins, leads, seal rings and heat sinks/studs tothe package.3.4 burr  an adherent fragment o f parent material ata component edge. In leadframes, the metal burr, due tothe stamping operation, may be in the horizontal orvertical direction to the surface. In ceramic packages,this type of characteristic is called a fin.3.5 castellations  metallized sem i-circular channelson chip carrier edges which provide contact betweeninternal package metallization traces and the externaltest pads. These castellations provide for improvedsolder fillets during attachment to a circuit board (seeFigure 1).3.6 cavity-down packages  pack ages where the diesurface faces the mounting board. (See Figure 2 for thepin grid array packages in the cavity-downconfiguration. It is more usual to refer to the chipcarrier mounting surfaces as the seating planes. In thiscavity orientation, the seating plane is Seating Plane 2per JEDEC JC-11.)3.7 cavity-up packages  package s where the diesurface faces away from the mounting board (seeFigure 2 or Seating Plane 1 for chip carriers).3.8 chip  region of material mis sing from acomponent (e.g., ceramic from a package, or solderfrom a preform). The region does not progresscompletely through the component and is formed afterthe component is manufactured. Chip size is defined byits length, width and depth from a projection of thedesign platform. Also called chipout (see Figure 1).3.9 co-fired  in the manufacturin g of some types ofceramic packages, the technology used to join togethervarious ceramic layers and metallization patternsscreened onto those layers by simultaneous firing athigh temperature.3.10 contact pad  in a leadless ch ip carrier or landgrid array, the metallized areas on the bottom of thepackage that provide contact point between the internalleads and connecting external circuitry. They are alsoused for electrical test pads. 3.11 crack  a cleavage or fracture that extends to thesurface of a semiconductor package or solder preform.The crack may or may not pass through the entirethickness of the package or preform.3.12 critical seal area (ceramic)  on asemiconductor package, the area bounded by theshortest nominal design distance from the largestcavity, usually the wire bond cavity, to the edge of thepackage or ceramic layer forming the seal area.3.13 critical seal area  metallizat ion or metal ring The entire area of the seal ring; it applies to platedrefractory metal or a metal ring.3.14 critical seal path (ceramic)  on asemiconductor package, the shortest nominal designdistance from the largest cavity, usually the wire bondcavity, to the edge of the package or ceramic layerforming the seal area.3.15 delamination  in a co-fired c eramic package,chip carrier, pin grid array, etc., the separation of oneceramic layer from another.3.16 element (packaging)  part of a semiconductorpackage feature (e.g., package leads have brazepaddle/stand-off and contact elements, pins have thenail head/braze area and contact elements).3.17 fin  on a ceramic package or cap, a finefeathery-edged projection of parent ceramic material onthe corner of the ceramic body.3.18 flatness  in a ceramic packag e or leadframe,the allowable deviation of a surface from a definedreference plane. The tolerance zone is defined by twoparallel planes within which the surface must lie.3.19 foreign material  an adheren t particle that isnot parent material of the component. Adherence meansthat the particle cannot be removed by an air or nitrogenblast at 20 psi.3.20 heat exchange area  a metal lized region on onemajor surface of the package to which heat sinks maybe attached by brazing, soldering, or adhesive resin.3.21 layer  on a cofired ceramic p ackage, the bodyis made from layers of ceramic or metallized ceramic.The layers are defined by their functionality, andseveral ceramic layers may be described as comprisingone functional layer if all are common in plan-form andfunction (e.g., die attach cavity) (see Figure 4).3.22 lead offset  in brazed lead ce ramic packages,the variation in position of the centerline of the leadwith reference to the centerline of the braze pad towhich it is mounted.3.23 lead sweep  lead movement , measured withrespect to a datum, perpendicular to the top or bottom

&lt;!-- Page 3 --&gt;

SEMI G61-94 © SEMI 19943 of the package that passes through the designed mid-point of the lead where the lead is attached to thepackage (e.g., side-brazed laminates), or where the leadexits the package body (e.g., plastic dual-in-linepackages). The movement is viewed from the side ofthe package, not the ends.3.24 lead-to-lead separation  the distance betweenadjacent leads when measured from their centerlines atthe point of connection to the package.3.25 lead tweeze  lead movement , measured withrespect to a datum, perpendicular to the top or bottomof the package that passes through the designed mid-point of the lead where the lead is attached to thepackage (e.g., side-brazed laminates), or where the leadexits the package body (e.g., plastic dual-in-linepackages). The movement is viewed from the ends ofthe package, not the side and the lead movement isfrom the edges of the package in toward the centerlineof the package.3.26 metallization void  the absen ce of a clad,evaporated, plated or screen-printed metal layer orbraze from a designated area. Also called metal orplating void.3.27 peeling (flaking)  any separa tion of a plated,vacuum-deposited, or clad metal layer from the basemetal of a leadframe, pin heatsink, or seal ring, from anunderplate, or from a refractory metal on a ceramicpackage. Peeling exposes the underlying metal.3.28 pin offset  the variation in po sition from thecenterline of the pin to the centerline of the braze pad towhich it is mounted.3.29 pin sweep  pin movement, measured withrespect to a datum, perpendicular to the top or bottomof the package that passes through the designed mid-point of pin where the pin is attached to the package(e.g., pin grid arrays). The movement is viewed formthe side of the package, not the ends.3.30 pin-to-pin separation  the di stance betweenadjacent pins when measured from their centerlines atthe point of connection to the package.3.31 pin tweeze  pin movement, m easured withrespect to a datum, perpendicular to the top or bottomof the package that passes through the designed mid-point of pin where the pin is attached to the package(e.g., pin grid arrays). The movement is viewed formthe ends of the package, not the side and the pinmovement is from the edges of the package in towardthe centerline of the package.3.32 pit  in semiconductor packa ges, plastic orceramic, or in the leadframes, a shallow depression orcrater. The bottom of the depression must be visible in order for the term to apply. A pit is formed duringcomponent manufacture (see Figure 3).3.33 porous surface  an uncompa cted ceramicsurface often showing fine pits.3.34 projection  on a semiconduc tor package(plastic or ceramic), leadframe or preform, andirregularly raised portion of a surface indigenous to theparent material.3.35 pullback  on a semiconducto r package, thelinear distance between the edge of a cavity cut into aceramic layer and the first measurable glass ormetallization layer interface coated onto the top surfaceof that layer. The total pullback may be the result of thehigh temperature processing required to manufacturethe package or to coat the surface. It may also be theresult of design considerations (see Figure 5).3.36 rundown  on a semiconduct or package, thelinear distance from the upper surface of a ceramiccavity layer to the bottom point of the overhang into thecavity, of a sealing glass or metallization layer that hasbeen screened onto that surface (see Figure 5).3.37 scrape  the irregular remova l of a depositedlayer from a base material by a shearing action fromanother surface such that the base material is exposedover an extended area. It can also apply to the removalof surface layers from a material. The material removedfrom the scraped area may build up at the edges of thescrape. The deposited layer may be a metal or glass.3.38 seal area  on a semiconduct or package, thearea designated for sealing a cover or lid to a cofiredceramic package, or a cap to a cer-DIP or cer-packbase. In the case of a co-fired ceramic package the sealarea may be either bare ceramic for glass sealing or ametallized area for solder sealing. The metallized sealarea may be a plating over refractory metallization or ametal ring, usually iron-nickel-cobalt or iron-nickelalloys, brazed to the refractory metal.3.39 seating plane  in plug-in pac kages such asdual-in-line (side-brazed or cer-DIP) or pin grid arrays,the plane defined by the three lowest stand-off featureson the lead or pins as measured from the bottom of thepackage, or in the absence of these features, by thepackage base or mounting plane (see Figure 6). Thefeatures, such as shoulders or projections, hold thepackage off the circuit board to which it is mounted.This gap allows solder flux and residues to be cleanedafter soldering the device and, in some cases, to allowfor sufficient cooling air flow around the device. Aprescribed force is used to hold the device in themounting holes when the seating plane is to bemeasured.
