All   fluids   are   transported   in   secondary\ncontainment piping systems for safety reasons.\n7. 4   Distribution  \u2014  The  transfer  is   made  from  the\nsource   by   means   of   certain   types   of   mechanisms,\nusually through one or more valve manifold boxes, that\ndirect the fluid to a point of use, to subordinate levels of\ndistribution, and/or to a day tank.\n7. 5   Control  Systems   \u2014   Manual   an d/or   automated\nmechanical,     pneumatic,     hydraulic,     optical,     and\nelectronic systems control the movement of the liquids.\nThis  includes  the  volume,  flow  rate,  pressure,  start-up,\nand shut-off.\n8  Optional Design Features\n8. 1  Polishing \u2014 BCD Systems ma y be designed with\nthe  possibility  of  chemical  recirculation  (1)  from  the\nincoming  source  and  back,  to  polish  the  incoming\nchemical;  (2)  from  the  day  tank  and  back  for  further\npolishing  or  timed  recirculation  if  activity  is  limited;\nand (3) fabwide in continuous recirculation.\n8. 2   Filtration  \u2014  Chemicals  in  the   system  may  be\nrecirculated through filters placed on-line in the system.\nThe  relevant  design  issues  include  types  of  filters,\nefficiency,  useful  lifetime,  qualification,  filter  bleed,\nremoval, and replacement.\n8. 3   Day  Tank  \u2014  The  vessel  that  g enerally  stores  a\nlimited    amount    of    chemical    volume    generally\nequivalent  to  that  used  in  about  one  day  of  operation.\nThis  holding  vessel  usually  stores  prefiltered  chemical\nbefore it is transferred to the manufacturing process.\n8. 4   Blending  \u2014  Certain  chemicals   in  distribution  are\nblended    together    for    use    in    the    semiconductor\nmanufacturing  process.

To attain these conditions, the\npressure  drop  ratio,  x,  should  be  less  than  or  equal  to\n0. 02.   Additional   data   points   should   be   taken   at\nincreasing  flowrates  up  to  the  maximum  possible  for\nthe system.\n9  Coefficients Calculation\n9. 1  Flow Coefficient, C\nv\n9. 1.1  The flow coefficient, C\nv\n, can b e calculated using\nboth   incompressible   and   compressible   fluids.   For\nincompressible  fluids,  ISA  provides  a  relatively  simple\nmethod for determining C\nv\n. For compressible fluids, the\nISA   test   method   for   calculating   C\nv\nrequires   the\ndetermination  of  the  choked  flow  pressure  drop  ratio,\nx\nT\n,,   and   ultimately   the   expansion   factor,   Y,   which\ncharacterizes the valve geometry and fluid properties at\nsonic   velocities   in   the   vena   contracta.   It   has   been\ndetermined    through    considerable    testing    that    the\nexpansion factor is critical in calculating actual pressure\ndrops  across  a  valve  when  flow  rates  cause  the  fluid\ndensity to change due to pressure and velocity changes.\n9. 2  Pressure Drop Ratio Factor, x\nT\n9. 2.1   The  ISA  test  method  requires  t he  experimental\ndetermination  of  the  flow  coefficient  C\nv\nand  a  second\ncoefficient x\nT\n, the pressure drop ratio factor.\n9. 2.2  x\nT\nis equal to the critical pressu re ratio of the ISA\nflow equation, and is close but not necessarily identical\nto the experimentally observed pressure ratio at choked\nflow. x\nT\nis   chosen   to   correlate   the   experimentally\nobserved  choked  flow.  The  ISA  equation  will  then\npredict choking at a pressure drop ratio close to, but not\nidentical with, the experimentally observed value.\n9. 2.3  There are two methods to dete rmine the pressure\ndrop  ratio  factor.  The  procedure  of  ANSI/ISA-S75.02,\nSection 7.2 requires that C\nv\nbe determined at values of x\nless than 0.02, and that choking actually be achieved to\ndetermine x\nT\n.  The  alternate  procedure  of  paragraph  7.3\ndoes  not  actually  require  choked  flow  and  uses  all  the\ndata  points  to  determine  C\nv\n,  not  just  a  few  points  at  a\nsmall value of x.\n9. 2.4   In  practice,  valves  used  in  the   semiconductor\nmanufacturing  facility,  when  connected  as  described\nabove,  may  not  be  able  to  achieve  choked  flow  across\nthe  pressure  taps  provided  by  this  procedure.  This  will\nhappen  when  choked  flow  occurs  first  in  some  other\npart  of  the  test  setup  or  connections.  However,  the\nalternative test procedure of ANSI/ISA-S75.02, Section\n7. 3 will give the correct values of C\nv\nand x\nT\nin this case.\n9. 2.5    The   ISA   alternative   method   de termines   the\npressure  drop  ratio  factor  by  measuring  flowrate  vs."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F32-0998 \xa9 SEMI 19985\npressure  ratio,  and  analyzes  the  data  to  compute  the\nchoked  flow  pressure  drop  ratio,  x\nT\n.

A  minimum\nuse pressure must be specified.\n13. 2.2   Permeation  and  effusion  tube  s tandards.  These\nmust  include  purification  means  and  some  means  of\nregulating  the  outlet  pressure.  The  impurity  delivery\nrate  can  be  calculated  based  on  the  weight  loss  of  the\ntube as a function of time.\n13. 2.3  Moisture standard methods ba sed on saturation\nof  gas  with  water  vapor  at  a  fixed  temperature  and\npressure.  The  moisture  concentration  in  the  gas  may\nthen  be  calculated  from  a  knowledge  of  the  saturation\nvapor  pressure  of  water  over  a  plane  of  the  pure  phase\nof   ice   at   the   saturation   temperature   and   of   the\ninteraction  virial  coefficients  of  the  gas-vapor  mixture.\nThe  two-pressure  and  two  temperature  methods  are\nrefinements   of   this   approach   requiring   additional\nchambers  whose  temperature  and  pressure  must  be\nknown.\n13. 3    Dilution   of   Standards   \u2014   For   a ll   impurity\ngeneration   methods,   lower   concentrations   can   be\ngenerated  by  dynamic  dilution,  i.e.,  by  combining  a\nknown  flow  of  the  standard  gas  with  a  known  flow  of\nzero gas. A diluted standard is acceptable provided:\n13. 3.1   The  zero  gas  should  have  an  im purity  level  at\nleast an order of magnitude below the stated level of the\nanalysis  (to  be  verified  using  the  same  flow  path  as\nduring  the  subsequent  analysis,  and  at  the  lowest  flow\nrate actually used in the calibration).\n13. 3.2   The  absolute  accuracy  of  the  d ilution  system\ncomponents  are  verified  by  comparison  with  a  reliable\nflow  standard.  The  frequency  of  verification  must  take\ninto  account  the  transport  of  the  instrument  and  other\nchanges that will affect the dilution system.\n13. 3.3   The  linearity  of  the  dilution  sy stem  can  be\ndemonstrated  over  the  entire  range  of  operation.  This\nlast  criterion  is  particularly  important  whenever  some\nportion  of  the  combined  flow  is  discarded,  as  mixing\nproblems can easily arise at large dilution factors.\n13. 4  Mass Calibration \u2014 The mass  scale of the mass\nspectrometer   should   be   calibrated   according   to   the\nmanufacturer\u2019s  instructions  over  the  mass  range  of\ninterest."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F33-0998 \xa9 SEMI 19983\n13. 4.1   The  validity  of  the  mass  select ed  for  each\nimpurity  must  be  confirmed  (i)  by  demonstrating  that\nthe  intensity  at  the  mass  increases  monotomically  with\nadded  concentration  of  the  impurity  species  of  interest\nand  (ii)  that  other  usually  present  impurity  species  do\nnot  make  significant  contributions  to  the  intensity  at\nthat mass.

This   includes   any\nspecialized  equipment  or  procedures  recommended  by\nthe CNC manufacturer.  Every effort should be taken to\nminimize  differences  in  the  particle  concentrations  of\nthe sampling volume relative to the actual test volume.\nCare  should  be  taken  to  provide  an  adequate  exhaust\nlength so that back diffusion of particles does not affect\nbackground  at  2  times  the  sampling  flow  rate.    This\nlength  will  depend  upon  the  particle  concentration  in\nthe ambient environment and on other factors.\n6. 9  Test   Particle   \u2014   Solid   non-volatile   particles.\nSodium  chloride  is  recommended,  but  other  particles\ncould be used such as polystyrene latex beads (PSL) if\nsufficiently high concentrations can be generated.\n7  Procedure\n7. 1  Static Background Test\n7. 1.1  Purge  the  system  at  a  high  velocity  flush  of  100\nslm   or   the   maximum   flow   rate   that   the   system\ncomponents will allow.\n7. 1.2  Purge  the  system  at  test  flow  rate  (Section  6.5).\nMeasure  the  particle  concentration  with  clean  gas  to\ndetermine    the    background    concentration.

The   sample\ninterval  shall  be  1  minute  in  duration.    Ensure  that  the\nbackground   counts   are   stable   or   decreasing.      If\nbackground cannot be achieved after 6 scf (170 sl) have\nbeen sampled, there may be a problem with the counter\nor test apparatus.
