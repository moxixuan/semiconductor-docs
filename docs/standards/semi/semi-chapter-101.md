SEMI M16-1103 © SEMI 1989, 2003 4 RELATED INFORMATION 1RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE REQUIREMENTS OF SEMI M16 ANDTHE REQUIREMENTS OF JEITA EM-3601 NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI M16. It was developed during therevision of the document in May 2003. This related information was approved for publication by full letterballot on September 19, 2003.R1-1 IntroductionR1-1.1 SEMI M16 and JEITA EM-3601 both providespecification requirements for polycrystalline silicon(poly) in nugget (chunk), granular, and rod forms.R1-1.2 This related information section providescomparisons between the two specifications with regardboth to the specification requirements and to the testmethods cited. R1-2 Specification RequirementsR1-2.1 The philosophies of the two specifications arequite different in that JEITA EM-3601 spells outspecific purity requirements, while SEMI M16 leavesthese to be as specified by the customer. The levelsspecified in JEITA EM-3601 may serve as a startingpoint for developing the necessary specifications.R1-2.2 Purity RequirementsR1-2.2.1 JEITA EM-3601 lists the following bulkpurity requirements for the nugget and rod forms:R1-2.2.1.1 Acceptor concentration, maximum: B 0.05 ppba Al 0.05 ppbaR1-2.2.1.2 Donor concentration, maximum: P 0.3 ppba As 0.05 ppbaR1-2.2.1.3 Carbon concentration, maximum: C 0.3 ppmaR1-2.2.2 JEITA EM-3601 lists the following bulkpurity requirements for the granular form: Total acceptors (B+Al) 0.1 ppba, maximum Total donors (P+As) 0.4 ppba, maximum Carbon 0.3 ppma, maximum R1-2.2.3 JEITA EM-3601 lists the following surfacemetal contamination requirements for the nugget andgranular forms (maximum surface metal contaminationlevels are not listed for the rod form): Fe, Cr, Ni, and Na 3.0 ppbw, maximum Zn 1.0 ppbw, maximumNOTE 2: These surface metal concentrations correspond to1.5 ppba for Fe, Cr, and Ni; 3.8 ppma for Na; and 0.5 ppba forZn.R1-2.3 Size Distribution  See Tables R1-1 throughR1-3.Table R1-1 Size Requirements for Nugget FormPolyJEITA EM-3601 SEMI M16Maximum Dimension 120 mm 150 mmMinimum Dimension 10 mm not specified Table R1-2 Size Requirements for Granular FormPolyJEITA EM-3601 SEMI M16Maximum Size 3,500 m 2,500 mMinimum Size 150 m 200 mMean Size not specified ~900m Table R1-3 Size Requirements for Rod Form PolyJEITA EM-3601 SEMI M16Minimum Length not specified rod diameter R1-3 Test Method RequirementsR1-3.1 Sample PreparationR1-3.1.1 JEITA EM-3601 contains instructions forpreparing samples for photoluminescence, infraredabsorption, and atomic absorption spectroscopymeasurements. It cites the 1996 edition of JIS H 0615for the preparation of samples from nugget and rodforms for photoluminescence measurements.

&lt;!-- Page 9 --&gt;

SEMI M16-1103 © SEMI 1989, 20035 R1-3.1.2 SEMI M16 specifies that samples forphotoluminescence and infrared measurements are to beprepared from nugget and rod forms in accordance withSEMI MF1723 and from granular form in accordancewith SEMI MF1708. Samples for atomic absorptionspectroscopy measurements are to be prepared inaccordance with SEMI MF1724.R1-3.1.3 The preparation procedures are generallysimilar, except that JIS H 0615 allows coring onlyperpendicular to the rod filament, but SEMI MF1723permits coring parallel with the rod filament in additionto perpendicular to the rod filament.R1-3.2 Measurement ProceduresR1-3.2.1 The photoluminescence technique is specifiedfor measurement of donor and acceptor concentrationsin both JEITA EM-3601 and in SEMI M16 (throughreference to SEMI MF1723); the latter also allows thisdetermination by low temperature FT-IR analysis. Thephotoluminescence technique is covered in SEMIMF1389 and in JIS H 0615. The latter, specified inJEITA EM-3601, allows only the high excitationcondition for the photoluminescence analysis while theformer allows either high or low excitation.R1-3.2.2 The infrared absorption method is specifiedfor the carbon determination in both SEMI M16 andJEITA EM-3601. The two cited test methods, SEMIMF1391, specified in SEMI M16 (through reference toSEMI MF1723), and JEITA EM-3503, cited in JEITAEM-3601, are essentially equivalent.R1-3.2.3 Atomic absorption spectroscopy is specifiedfor the surface metal contamination in both SEMI M16and JEITA EM-3601. The two cited test methods,SEMI MF1724, specified in SEMI M16, and JIS K0121, cited in JEITA EM-3601, are essentiallyequivalent insofar as the actual measurement isconcerned, but SEMI MF1724 also standardizes thesampling procedures, etching solutions, and method ofcollecting the impurities in much greater detail.

SEMI M17-0704 © SEMI 1990, 20041 SEMI M17-0704GUIDE FOR A UNIVERSAL WAFER GRID This specification was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on April 22, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org May 2004;to be published July 2004. Originally published in 1990; previously published September 1998.1 Purpose1.1 Maximum allowable slip and other non-uniformlydistributed defects are frequently specified whenprocuring polished and epitaxial silicon wafers. SEMIM2 specifies a maximum allowable fraction of theepitaxial wafer surface area that can contain slip.1.2 This guide provides a design for and guidance foruse of a wafer grid that facilitates the determination ofthe fraction of the wafer surface area covered byobserved defects.2 Scope2.1 This document defines a grid pattern that is usefulfor quantifying surface defects on a nominally circularsemiconductor wafer. The grid is defined such that itcontains 1000 elements of approximately equal area.Each grid element thus contains 0.1 percent of the totalquality area of the surface being inspected. Defects thatare non-uniformly distributed (for example, slip) can bequantified in terms of the percent defective (or percentuseful) area on the wafer surface.2.2 The grid described is referenced to the center of thewafer. A concept of a Fixed Quality Area is used,based on nominal wafer diameter, such as is specifiedin SEMI M1.2.3 Methods for observing these defects on siliconwafer surfaces are outside the scope of this guide. Suchmethods may be found in SEMI MF1725, SEMIMF1726, JIS H 0609, and DIN 50434.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specifications for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI M2  Specifications for Silicon EpitaxialWafers for Discrete Device ApplicationsSEMI MF154 Guide for Identification of Structuresand Contaminants Seen on Specular Silicon Surfaces SEMI MF1241  Terminology of Silicon TechnologySEMI MF1725  Practice for Analysis ofCrystallographic Perfection of Silicon IngotsSEMI MF1726  Practice for Analysis ofCrystallographic Perfection of Silicon WafersSEMI MF1809  Guide for Selection and Use ofEtching Solutions to Delineate Structural Defects inSilicon3.2 Japan Industrial Standard1 JIS H 0609  Test methods of crystalline defects insilicon by preferential etch techniques3.3 DIN Standard2 50434  Determination of Crystal Defects inMonocrystalline Silicon Using Etching Techniques on&#123;111&#125; and &#123;100&#125; SurfacesNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 4 Terminology4.1 Definitions for many surface defects are given inSEMI MF1241.

Thisdiameter would normally be chosen to be the nominaldiameter of the fixed quality area to allow for suchthings as an edge exclusion, tolerance variations in thewafer diameter, and edge rounding. Table 2 shows thecircle diameters for a series of grids which have a fixedquality area radius 3 or 4 mm smaller than the nominalradius of selected wafers specified in SEMI M1.5.1.3 Identification of each grid element is done byreferring to a circle number and a division number onthat circle. Circles are numbered from the center out,with the center circle being number 01 and theoutermost circle being number 18. The divisions arenumbered starting with the first divisioncounterclockwise from the horizontal line which startsat the center of the grid and extends to the right, whenthe primary fiducial (flat or notch) is placed at thebottom of the grid. Divisions are progressivelynumbered counterclockwise from 01 to n, where nequals the total number of divisions on the circle. Anelements address is given by two sets of numbersseparated by a comma: circle (018), division (01n).Elements 18, 01 and 18, 100 are identified in Figure 1.5.2 Wafers without a Primary Flat5.2.1 The grid elements for wafers without a primaryflat are illustrated in Figure 1. This pattern is generatedby making concentric circles with relative diametersand radial divisions as specified in Table 1. In this tablethe circle number is given in the leftmost column. Thenumber of divisions and the included angle of eachdivision in the circle are given in the second and thirdcolumns. The total number of divisions (from the centeroutward) is given in the fourth column. The includedarea ratio, given in the fifth column, is the total numberof divisions included within a circle divided by 1000,the total number of divisions in the grid. The relativediameter, given in the rightmost column, is the squareroot of the included area ratio.5.3 Wafers with a Primary Flat5.3.1 For wafers with a primary flat, a standardincluded angle of 43.2° is used for all wafer sizes. Thisangle was chosen because it lies between the maximumand minimum included angles of the primary flatsspecified in SEMI M1 for 100 mm, 125 mm, 150 mm,and 200 mm diameter wafers. In addition, if a fixedquality area of radius 3 mm less than the nominal waferradius (or smaller) is used, the grid will not in any caseextend beyond the edge of the wafer in the region of theprimary flat. 5.3.2 This flat is propagated into the wafer asillustrated in Figure 2. The diameter of each circle is thesame as for wafers without a primary flat. The flat ispropagated vertically downward (starting with circlenumber 3) by the intersection of the circle with ahorizontal chord which subtends 43.2°.5.3.3 The areas of the grid elements within thepropagated flat region are slightly smaller than the areasof the regular grid elements. This difference is ignoredwhen counting grid elements for wafers with a primaryflat. All grid elements are assumed to be 0.001 of thetotal fixed quality area.5.4 Secondary Flats5.4.1 The grid ignores secondary flats. These areshallow enough that the outer circle does not extendbeyond the wafer edge if a fixed quality area of radius 3mm less than the nominal wafer radius is used.NOTE 1: In this sense, the fixed quality area used by theUniversal Wafer Grid deviates somewhat from the formaldefinition in SEMI M1 which embodies an edge exclusion ofconstant width around the entire periphery of the waferincluding the region of the secondary flat. 6 Use of the Grid6.1 The quantification of defective area is done byoverlaying a transparency of the grid onto a map ofwafer defects or by mapping observed defects onto thegrid. The number of grid elements which containdefects is counted. The element count divided by 10corresponds to the percent of defective area. This gridcould also be superimposed onto a CRT display,photograph, or computer generated map, whereapplicable. In use, grid pattern diameters must bescaled to the size of the map or image of the wafer to beoverlaid.

SEMI M18-0704 © SEMI 1990, 20041 SEMI M18-0704FORMAT FOR SILICON WAFER SPECIFICATION FORM FOR ORDERENTRY This format was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the Japanese Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the Japanese Regional StandardsCommittee on April 30, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org June 2004; to be published July 2004.Originally published in 1990; last published March 2004. 1 Purpose1.1 This format provides a standard form for specifyingseveral classifications of silicon wafers, as follows:1.1.1 Polished Silicon Wafers.1.1.2 Epitaxial Silicon Wafers.1.1.3 Epitaxial Silicon Wafers with Buried Layer.1.1.4 Annealed Silicon Wafer.1.1.5 SOI Wafers for CMOS Applications.1.2 This format also lists the Electronic DataInterchange (EDI) codes used in SEMI T6 to identifythe type of data being reported in the EDI message. 2 Scope2.1 The form is designed to be used in conjunctionwith other SEMI specifications where details of thedimensional, physical, electrical, and chemicalproperties are defined or specified. However, the formincludes many items that are not currently included inthe SEMI specifications. Also, many items are not nowcommonly specified, but may find increasedimportance in the future. The intention is to provide forflexibility and expansion of the technology.2.2 This format provides for specifying and orderingsilicon wafers with varying levels of complexity. Theminimum level of completeness is shown in each case,with additional options included to allow forcustomization of the wafer to the specific processingrequirements of the user. If a particular item is not ofinterest, no entry is required. The only required entriesare those marked as such for the purpose of minimalspecification (diameter, orientation, dopant, resistivity,etc.).2.3 Values for many items are listed either in thepolished silicon wafer standards in SEMI M1 or in thedefect limits tables in SEMI M1, SEMI M2, or SEMIM11. If these standard specifications are sufficient fordefining the wafers, only a single entry is required ineach section of the form.2.4 This format also lists the codes required by SEMIT6 to identify the parameter being reported in the EDI message. Where necessary, secondary characteristicsor identifier codes are listed within a generalizedcharacteristic.2.5 For referee purposes, U.S. Customary units shall beused for wafers of 2- and 3-inch diameters, and SI(System International, commonly called metric) unitsfor 100 mm and larger diameter wafers.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specifications for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI M2  Specifications for Silicon EpitaxialWafers for Discrete Device ApplicationsSEMI M11  Specifications for Silicon EpitaxialWafers for Integrated Circuit (IC) ApplicationsSEMI M12  Specification for Serial AlphanumericMarking of the Front Surface of WafersSEMI M13  Specifications for AlphanumericMarking of Silicon WafersSEMI M20  Specification for Establishing a WaferCoordinate SystemSEMI M33  Test Method for the Determination ofResidual Surface Contamination on Silicon Wafers byMeans of Total Reflection X-Ray FluorescenceSpectroscopy (TXRF)SEMI M35  Guide for Developing Specifications forSilicon Wafer Surface Features Detected by AutomatedInspectionSEMI M47  Specification for Silicon-on-insulator(SOI) Wafers for CMOS LSI ApplicationsSEMI MF26  Standard Test Methods forDetermining the Orientation of a SemiconductiveSingle Crystal

SEMI M18-0704 © SEMI 1990, 20047 7 Testing Level and Certification7.1 Material ordered using this format shall be testedand/or certified to the limits set forth in the individualcriteria.7.2 The actual testing level, whether the test isperformed on all wafers, a sample of the wafers, specialtest pieces representing all portions of the material, or asample of the test pieces, may be specified using thisformat.7.3 In some cases, the material may be certified ascapable of meeting certain requirements. In thiscontext, the supplier is not required to perform the testsoutlined in this format. However, if the purchaserperforms the test and the material fails to meet therequirement, the material may be subject to rejection. 8 EDI Codes and Sub-Parameter Codes8.1 The EDI Codes for each parameter are listed in thefollowing Table. Where necessary for clarity,additional sub-parameters are listed. These sub-parameter identify a specific measurement technique ormethod to be used.8.2 If additional codes are required in the future, theywill be added to the table, beginning with the nextavailable EDI code identifier. This will allow the tableto be rearranged for clarity while maintaining uniqueand consistent EDI codes for existing parameters.Table 2 provides a numerically sorted list of the EDICodes.

SEMI M19-91 © SEMI 1991, 19961 SEMI M19-91SPECIFICATION FOR ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF BULK GALLIUMARSENIDE SINGLE CRYSTAL SUBSTRATES 1 IntroductionFor the specification, three principal types of materialwere identified: semi-insulating, n-type, and p-type.This encompasses the full range of conductivitycharacteristics for Gallium Arsenide (GaAs). Section 3considers subclasses of these characteristics definingthe species which may be used for producing theconductivity type. For semi-insulating material, specialcases have been isolated.Undoped, Grade A1 represents those materials whichare of high resistivity and stable following growth,without necessitating any additional annealing orprocessing. The Grade A2 material, high purity,requires additional thermal processing followinggrowth to bring the resistivity to a level &gt; 10 7 Ω-cm. Atthis time, most producers have indicated that themajority of the Grade A2 ingots have resistivitycharacteristics which rise into the acceptable range afteran appropriate thermal cycle. However, thisphenomenon is sensitive to the details of the time-temperature cycle, and thus, such an increase cannot beguaranteed in every application. Thus, the label GradeA2 is used to denote this material.Chromium doping produces a high resistivity material.However, due to the rapid diffusion of Cr duringprocessing and the propensity for surface accumulation,it is not as well suited to processing as grades 3.A.1 and3.A.2, thus we assign this material grade A.Iso-electric dopant additions do not appear to affect theresistivity significantly, but rather, permit the reductionof dislocation generation in the final product. Thus, thismaterial is classified Grade A. While In is the mosteffective hardening agent, Al, P, and Sb are also viablespecies. They are included for completeness and toreduce the likelihood of document revision at a laterdate. The Grade B specification encompasses thosematerials where the impurity and point defect densitiesare not quite in the proper balance, but the resistivity issuitable for less-stringent applications.For conducting material, the best characterized, non-transition metal species have been included as n-typedopants; for p-type, a broader range of species has beenincluded, as transition metals are useful acceptorimpurities.Section 4 defines the resistivity and stability of semi-insulating material as specified in Section 3. A stringentlimit was placed on the Grade A2 material to minimizethe likelihood that this material converts to low resistivity upon annealing. The issue of surfaceconversion in Cr-doped material was dealt with byeliminating a requirement for n-type characteristicsfollowing annealing.The resistivity ranges for n-type conducting materialwere determined from the carrier concentration table(Section 5) and mobility values, using the analysis ofWalukiewicz et al, J. Appl. Phys. 50 (1979) 899. Thisplaces a constraint on the permissible compensationratio, selected to be in the range of approximately 0.0 to0.7. The specification was designed then to excludeabnormally poor crystals. As limited data and demandexist for p-type material, there are no ranges specifiedat this writing. Should a significant body of data evolve,this specification may be designed and balloted asappropriate.Section 5 deals with impurity concentrations, netelectron yields and implicitly, with point defectconcentrations. For semi-insulating material of highquality, the impurities are, at the present time, notreliably measurable (carbon is the notable exception).Thus the unspecified nomenclature. For types A-3and A-4, the determination of the amount of therelevant impurity species is given to the appropriateparty, the user, and producer, respectively.For n-type materials, the ranges were selected to definea high purity regime (n ≤ 4  10 16 cm-3 ), an intermediateregime where donor density is not more than ~10 timesthe typical deep level density; the transition regionwherein deep levels are suppressed (range B-3); ahighly doped range (&gt; 10 ppm net electronconcentration yield); and saturation doping rangewhere the crystal growth process and thermodynamicsdetermine the limits of impurity incorporation andelectron yield.In Section 6, the electron mobility values and ranges arestated. For semi-insulating materials, the values thathave been determined by consensus are 5000 cm2/V-sfor Grade A1 and 6000 cm2/V-s. In the interest ofharmony, and to prevent further debilitatingdiscussions, the authors and participants at the SEMImeetings, and responses from producers have been usedto set this value at 5000 cm2/V-s. The producersindicated that the Grade A2 material nearly alwaysexceeds 6000 cm2/V-s, and thus this value was adopted.For chromium doped materials, the mobility is lesspredictable and, therefore, is negotiated between theuser and producer. In-doped materials have consistentlylower mobilities, resulting from strain-effects,

SEMI M19-91 © SEMI 1991, 1996 2 scattering, and other related phenomena. Thus, based onproducer experience, the minimum value was set at3500 cm2/V-s.For n-type materials, the mobility ranges were selectedto represent compensation ratios in the range ofapproximately 0.0 to 0.7 for a given net electronconcentration. P-type material is not yet characterizedsufficiently to warrant a specification. 2 ScopeThis document specifies the characteristics and rangesof electrical properties for bulk GaAs crystals andsubstrate wafers. For high resistivity and n-typeconducting materials, the permissible growth conditionsor impurity species are stated; the electrical propertiescorresponding to the appropriate range(s) are noted.Due to the limited understanding, experience anddemand for p-type materials only guidelines areprovided in this specification at the present writing. 3 Conductivity TypeA.
