It can also be used as aguide to evaluate process modifications to suchsystems. This guideline is intended to be applicable forphoto, DUV, x-ray, and electron beam processes. 2 BackgroundRelease of the information in this document wasapproved by the SEMI Photolithographic ChemicalsCommittee (Resist Committee) in May 1987. Thiscommittee plans to complete and revise the guideline asappropriate. Comments will be welcomed. 3 ScopeVirtually all lithographic fabrication processes vary insome way from location to location, even for the sametype of resist. Consequently, it is impossible to providea stringent evaluation program acceptable to most users.It is, therefore, the aim of this guideline to provide aprogram of tests and methods that allows variable, butcontrolled, process differences. In order to maintain aproper baseline control for each process, all tests shouldbe run relative to some internal standard product whosefunctional characteristics are known and characterized.It is understood that each product is to be run at its ownpreferred or recommended conditions and that differentproducts maybe evaluated under different conditions. Itshould also be understood that some properties,variables, or conditions, such as normality, are specificto resist type, such as positive photoresist, and are to beused only where applicable. Further, since this guide isdirected to functional testing, it is assumed that anyproducts to be evaluated have passed all relevantchemical and physical testing before such functionaltesting. 4 PrioritiesThis guideline has been divided into two separategroups. The first group, called Sustaining Tests,includes tests that are necessary for timely adjustmentsto coating and exposure conditions in order to maintainconsistent image dimensions (Tables 13). The secondgroup, called Extended Testing, includes tests that arerequired for full evaluation of the resist system (Tables46). These tests may, or may not, be necessary for evaluation of each lot of product, depending on theindividual requirements of the user. 5 Referenced Documents5.1 ASTM Standards1F 518  Practice for

Masks previouslyordered which are not affected by the new order transmission may have their , or omitted as appropriate.6.4 Options are specified hierarchically such that those specified at a higher level are the default for all masksbelow, unless overridden at a lower level. The hierarchy is such that mask set options are overridden by mask groupoptions, followed by mask definition, cell definition, cell instance, pattern group definition, and pattern definition.6.5 Mask groups describe sets of masks which are similarly constructed. In simple cases there will be only onemask group per mask set. Multiple mask groups will be needed to describe mix-and-match sets, or for situationswithin a mask set where different features are required on some masks.6.6 Pattern group definitions are intended for patterns which are similarly placed on all or most masks within amask group (e.g., primary pattern files or test pattern files).6.7 Cell definitions describe the construction of clusters of pattern groups and/or other cells.

If a record starts with an exclamation point, the entire record will be ignored. Onlyprintable ASCII characters (plus spaces and tabs) are permitted in comments.

If a vendordetects such flaws in a file from a customer, the vendor should contact the customer to correct the inconsistenciesand/or remove the ambiguities before proceeding with making the mask. 7 Syntax SpecificationThe following specifies the syntax for the mask order structures. The record order is specific; records must appear inthe sequence shown. Terminology for the individual records and their allowed data values are specified in 8.7.1 Syntax Symbol Definition  The lower case syntactic names within ","<"," ",">"," are used to refer to collections ofrecords. The use of ","{"," ","}"," around records or collections of records means an arbitrary number of repetitions of therecords, including none at all. The use of ","["," ","]"," around a record or collection of records means that the collection isoptional.7.2 Record Syntax  A keyword is followed by a data field which is followed by an optional comment. The recordis terminated by a carriage return and/or linefeed. Each of these elements may be preceded by any combination ofspaces or tabs, which will be ignored. At least one space or tab is required preceding the first data value in therecord. An exclamation point (!) is required to initiate a comment. Exclamation points, carriage returns, andlinefeeds are not allowed in keywords, data values or comments. Note that a record consisting of a comment only isalso allowed. The syntax for individual records is defined as: = ","[","{","}"," ","{","}"," ","]","[","{","}"," !

Markup Language (XML) Format  The following filedefines the Mask Order Data Structure Syntax (above) in Extensible Markup Language Schema Definition (XSD)format. Should the user choose to implement the mask order data file in Extensible Markup Language (XML), thefile must validate against this XSD. For optimal viewing, paste the text into a program designed to read XML suchas an internet browser. The content of both versions of representation of mask order data should be entirelyequivalent. Since the XML schema is derived directly from the Mask Order Data Structure Syntax, in the event of adiscrepancy between the two, the Data Structure Syntax should be considered to be the more correct. 2005 SEMI.
