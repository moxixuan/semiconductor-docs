The  \u201cJobType\u201d  property  specified  in  the  inherited  interface  should  be  set  to  \u201cTransportJobType\u201d  for  all\nTransportJob  requests.  The  additional  Job  Specification  properties  required  for  the  creation  of  Transport  jobs  are\ndefined in Table 3.  The types of machines specified in the TransportJob are AMHS Storage Machines, Fixed Buffer\nProduction Equipment, or Internal Buffer Production Equipment.

In these cases there may be a time delay before the results of a transportJob makeAborted request can be\nenacted to allow the transport equipment to reach a known location.

Also  note  that  material  can  be  either  product,  durables,  or  consumables.  The  CIM\nFramework  recognizes  the  potential  for  multiple  AMHS\u2019s  within  a  single  factory  (e.g.,  one  supplier  of  interbay\nmovement  and  another  supplier  of  intrabay  movement).  The  MES,  however,  wants  to  only  have  to  issue  a  move\nrequest  (\u201cmove  this  material  from  here  to  there\u201d)  without  regard  to  whether  that  transport  spans  one  or  more\nAMHS\u2019s. Therefore, the component supporting material transport requires a single entry point for initiating material\ntransport which will be through the Material Transport Manager (MTM).\n6. 4.2  The Material Transport Manag er must be able manage transport jobs carried out by many different AMHS\u2019s.\nTo  accomplish  this,  a  separate  interface  for  a  Material  Transport  Controller  (MTC)  is  specified.  In  the  simplest\nimplementations, a single MTM may manage all TransportJobs directly. In this case no separate Material Transport\nController implementation is needed. If there is a need for delegation to one or more Material Transport Controllers,\nthe  Material  Transport  Manager  can  register  any  conformant  MTC  implementation  which  supports  the  specified\ninterface.  The  low-level  interaction  of  the  material  movement  controllers  with  the  physical  equipment  (transport\nmachines, storage machines and ports) is encapsulated within the scope of this component. Note that the component\nmanager  does  not  provide  lifecycle  services  for  its  managed  material  movement  controllers,  but  instead  uses  the\nregistration interfaces.\n6. 4.3  MaterialTransportManager In terface\nModule:MaterialTransport\nInterface:MaterialTransportManager\nInherited Interface:ComponentManager, TransportJobSupervisor, JobRequestor\ninterfaceMaterialTransportManager: FactoryOperations::ComponentManager,\nTransportJobSupervisor, AbstractIF::JobRequestor {"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E102-0600 \xa9 SEMI 200019\nDescription:A  MaterialTransportManager  (MTM)  operates  on  requests  to  move  material  in  the\nfactory.

First, the Factory Supervisor sets the Durable unit to a\nparticular  value  based  on  user  specifications.

It  is  not  required  that  the  Durable  unit  and  MaterialTrackingLocation  unit  be\nidentical  in  order  for  a  mapping  to  occur,  the  MTSC  may  implement  mapping  logic  in  order  to  obtain  various\nrelationships between Durable units and MaterialTrackingLocation units.\nFactory Supervisor\nFactory Supervisor determines\nthe \u201cParameter \u201d based on the\nrules.\nFactory Supervisor writes the\n\u201cUnitvalue \u201d using \u201csetUnit \u201d\nfor the carrier.\nMTSC\nMTSC maps durable unit to\nmachine MTL unit.\nPhoto\nDummy\nEmpty\nDurable UnitsMachine MTL Units\nProduct\nFlow\nType of Carrier\nDurable unit to\nMachine  MTL\nunit mapping\nConditions\nMTM obtains  \u201cDurable Units\u201d  using\n\u201cgetUnit \u201d from Durable interface.\nL/P-1\nL/P-2\nL/P-3\nL/P-4\nL/P-5\nL/P-6\nL/P-7\nMTM obtains \u201cMachine MTL Units\u201d using\n\u201cgetUnit\u201d from Machine MTL interface.\nFigure R2-1\nStorage in Logical Partitions\nNOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the specification set forth herein for\nany particular application.
