It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardSEMI F66  Specification for Port Marking andSymbol of Stainless Steel Vessels for Liquid ChemicalsNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 4 Terminology4.1 Definitions4.1.1 canister  a metal (usually stainless steel)container in which a liquid precursor is supplied.Canisters are also known as ampoules, shuttledrums,  tanks, etc.4.1.2 liquid precursor  a liquid precursor is achemical supplied as a liquid and used in ChemicalVapor Deposition (CVD). Many liquid precursors aretoxic, reactive and air-sensitive. 5 Ports5.1 A canister has a gas inlet port and a liquid outletport. The outlet port is equipped with a dip-tube,marked according to SEMI F66. Note that a canistermay be used as a bubbler, by using the dip-tube port asthe gas inlet. In this standard however, liquid deliveryis assumed and the dip-tube port will be referred to asthe outlet.5.2 Canisters up to 100 liters in volume:5.2.1 The ports will be located with the dip tube at the3 oclock position and the gas inlet at the 9 oclockposition, as illustrated in Figure 1.

SEMI F97-0305 © SEMI 20051 SEMI F97-0305SPECIFICATION FOR FACILITY PACKAGE INTEGRATION,MONITORING AND CONTROL This specification was technically approved by the Global Facilities Committee and is the directresponsibility of the European Global Facilities Committee. Current edition approved by the EuropeanRegional Standards Committee on November 10, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org January 2005; tobe published March 2005. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this specification is to provide the requirements for the architecture, functionality and interfacesfor Facility Monitoring and Control Systems and the various Facility Package Units to enable a standardized andintegrated communication between them. This specification is appended with related information to provideapplication examples.1.2 Background and Motivation1.2.1 Today, the suppliers of Facility Package Units (e.g., chemicals, power supply, gases, HVAC) are often usingindividual communication concepts. This leads to high efforts to specify the communication structures betweenFacility Package Units (FPU) and the Facility Monitoring and Control Systems (FMCS), to evaluate the quotedsolutions and to eventually integrate these units. These individual, not standardized concepts today are not reusable,bear risks in execution and lead to high maintenance costs.1.2.2 This specification is a first step to standardize the communication between facility and monitoringcomponents. Therefore, it focuses in its scope to a small set of requirements which are common to all FPUs. Asthis communication concept is adopted by the various FPU suppliers and their customers, more specific standardsdescribing particular FPUs and their services may evolve.1.3 Who and what is addressed by this standard.1.3.1 A standardization of the communication concept between FMCS and FPUs will support Facility Package Unitmanufacturers, general contractors, system integrators, purchasers, and control system manufacturers. It will lead tosubstantially reduced costs, more reliable execution times, and optimized maintenance concepts. 2 Scope2.1 This standard specifies the requirements for the architecture, common services, data, and its semantic meaningto integrate the FPUs into the FMCS. For this purpose, a basic set of common services (operations) between theFMCS and the FPUs are specified to exchange FPU status information and data. In addition, the state models forFPUs are described.2.2 Out of scope for this standard are: Services of FMCS provided to interface to Manufacturing Execution Systems or Enterprise Resource PlanningSystems, Specification of functionality of particular FMCS functions (graphical user interface (GUI), data archives,reporting archives, alarm handling, etc.), and The specification of the interface between FPU control level and FPU field level.2.3 Applicability  This standard applies to the field of facility management and is targeted for FPU suppliers andFMCS suppliers for systems integration, engineering and commissioning as well as the operation of such systems bythe purchasers.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.

SEMI F97-0305 © SEMI 2005 6 7 Ordering Information7.1 When integrating FPUs into a FMCS, suppliers and purchasers have to agree on details on how the integrationwill be performed. This includes a number of items such as the information to be exchanged between FMCS andFPUs, the communication protocol to be used2, or details of the available FPU subcontrol level. Other parties suchas fab planners or system integrators may be involved in this information exchange. Related Information 2 providesa template for the ordering information and examples for its use. 8 Conventions8.1 This standard follows the conventions for state model methodology and service definitions as defined by otherSEMI standards supplemented by specific extensions. The conventions used in this standard are described in thefollowing paragraphs.8.2 State Model Methodology8.2.1 This document uses the state model methodology as defined within SEMI E30 to describe the behavior ofFPUs. A state model is comprised of the following elements: definitions of each state and sub state, a diagram of the states and the transition between states, and a state transition table.8.2.2 The diagram of the state model uses the Harel State Chart notation3.8.3 Notion of Alarm-Mode, Warning-Mode, Error-Mode  Signifies the importance of the situation that occurred atthe FPU to draw attention at the FMCS. Error-Mode is generally used to signify an error. This error may bepersistent for some time until the error situation is corrected. Warning-Mode may be used to signal a higherawareness that is to be raised at the FMCS. Again, attention may be needed to correct the problem. Alarm-Modesignals the highest awareness required and may again need some attention for correction. The use of which mode isused when and where is intentionally left to the agreement between the purchaser and the supplier. It isrecommended to use always the same philosophy for use of these three modes for the entire facility when possible.8.4 Transition Tables8.4.1 Transition Tables are provided in conjunction with the state diagrams to explicitly describe the nature of eachstate transition. A transition table contains columns for transition number, previous state, trigger, new state, actionsand a remark. The trigger for the transition occurs while in the previous state. The actions include a combination ofactions taken upon exit of the previous state and actions taken upon entry into the new state.Number PreviousStateTrigger NewStateActions Remark 8.5 Operation Representation8.5.1 Operations are used to describe interfaces between different resources (e.g. interfaces between FMCS andFPUs). An operation definition table defines the specific set of operations for a specific resource as shown in thefollowing table:Operation Description 8.5.2 Operation  Defines the operation name. The operation name has to be unique for each given resource.8.5.3 Description  Gives a short comprehensive description of the operation with regard to functionality. 2 As an example, OPC Data Access combined with the agreed communications protocol may be used for interconnecting FMCS and FPUs.3 Harel, D., "Statecharts: A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems", Science of Computer Programming 8 (1987), p. 231-274

SEMI F97-0305 © SEMI 20057 8.6 Parameter Definitions8.6.1 When calling an operation, parameters can be passed and returned. Parameters to be passed and returneddepend upon the operation that is called. By using a parameter definition table the parameters passed and returnedby an operation are defined.Parameter Description Direction Data Type 8.6.2 Parameter  Within the parameter column the name of the specific parameter is given.8.6.3 Description  Contains a description of a parameter.8.6.4 Direction  Defines the direction: FMCS -&gt; FPU: originated by FMCS and received by FPU FPU -&gt; FMCS: originated by FPU and received by FMCS8.6.5 Data Type  Defines the format of a parameter.8.7 Field Definitions8.7.1 A parameter can consist of different fields that define the contents of a parameter. A field definition tabledefines the format of the fields maintained within a specific parameter. Field Bit Meaning Mandatory/optional 8.7.2 Field  A parameter can consist of different fields representing the contents of a parameter. Within the fieldcolumn the name of the specific field is given.8.7.3 Bit  In case a field is stored within a bitwise-formatted parameter, the bit column defines the bit number orbit range where the field value is stored.8.7.4 Meaning  Defines the meaning of the one or several field values.8.7.5 Mandatory/Optional  Defines if setting the value of a field is either mandatory or optional. 9 Requirements9.1 Interconnection between FMCS and FPUs9.1.1 The interconnection between the FMCS and the FPUs may be made by any type of bus system specified bySEMI (e.g. SEMI E54 series) as well as industrial ethernet based networks. It is the purpose of this standard: to specify the semantics of the services that are exchanged between the FMCS and the FPUs, and to model the status information of the state machines that are maintained by the FPUs.9.1.2 As introduced in 7, state models are used to represent the current state of a FPU. The FMCS may use thisstate information in order to display the state of all FPUs. In addition, the FMCS may decide based on the state of aFPU whether remote operations on a FPU are advisable or not.FMCS FPU 1 FPU 2 FPU n FMCS FPU 1 FPU 2 FPU nFigure 3Interconnection Between FMCS and FPUs

SEMI F97-0305 © SEMI 2005 8 9.2 FPU Requirements9.2.1 The FPU shall be able to run without a FMCS and shall communicate a minimal amount of status informationto FMCS via the network as described in the next section.9.3 FMCS Requirements9.3.1 The FMCS shall be able to support the interface to the FPU and to make the information of this interfaceavailable through the Data Cache of the FMCS. The FMCS shall be able to either monitor and/or control the FPUdepending on the application.9.4 State Models of Facility Package Unit9.4.1 State Models are used to describe the status of the FPU. For the definition of the status models see 8. In thefollowing all status values are specified together with their transitions.9.4.2 Watchdog-Toggle9.4.2.1 The Watchdog-toggle shall be used to signal that a FPU still is capable to perform its processing functionand is able to notify this to the FMCS. As long as the toggle mechanism alternates between on and off theprocessing function of the FPU is assumed to be functional. The processing function is assumed to be aprogrammed function, e.g. for a PLC. The toggle mechanism shall be linked into the processing function of the FPUso that if the processing function stops, the toggle mechanism will stop as well. Watchdog-toggle represents avariable that toggles its value between 0 and 1 within a specified time window. The maximum required cycletime shall not exceed one minute. The Watchdog-toggle is used to realize a life-beat monitoring function.9.4.2.2 The Watchdog-toggle is always required except in the case that the underlying communication system of the FPU and the FMCS already provides an integratedlife-beat function, or the FPU is a very simple device which does not provide any processing function (e.g., a valve, electrical engineor heater).

It may assume two values:Local and Remote. The behavior of the FPU with respect to the states Local and Remote is out of scope. It isdependent on the type of FPU. Control Mode is intended to be used by the FMCS to identify whether a remoteoperation of the FPU is enabled or disabled  by this the FMCS can allow or disallow operator actions on the FMCS

It assumes three main values: Down, in Stand-by or Run. The behavior of the FPU with respect to the states of Run-Mode is out of scope. It is dependent on thetype of FPU. The Annex to this Standard (see Related Information 1) provides some examples of the use of Run-Mode. The Run-Mode provides general information of the FPU, whether it is Down, in Stand-by or in Run: Down (the FPU is in a fault situation or it may be switched into Down by a pre scheduled function; this isspecified by an optional flag):o flag set for scheduled downo flag set for unscheduled down Stand-by (the FPU is ready to be switched into Run). Run (the FPU is running).9.4.5.2 The FPU should assume optionally sub states when in Run or Stand-by. These sub states are: Run: sub state Locked (the FPU is locked to hold the Run state) or Not\_Locked and Stand-by: sub state Locked (the FPU is locked to hold the Stand-by state) or Not\_Locked.
