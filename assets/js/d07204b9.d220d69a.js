After drying and charge neutralization,particles of the required size are extracted from theaerosol using an electrostatic classifier (EC). Theconcentration of particles in the resulting monodisperseaerosol is then recorded by the CNC and compared tothat measured simultaneously by a referenceinstrument. Examples of suitable reference instrumentsare described in Section 8.8.NOTE 4: This method has been shown to provide repeatableresults in tests performed in separate laboratories on similarCNCs. Examples of these tests are found in Agarwal andSem3 and Bartz, et al4. 7 Requirements7.1 The reference instrument must have a provencounting efficiency of not less than 95% over the entirerange of particle sizes tested. Low counting efficiencyin the reference instrument results in an error in themeasured particle concentration. The countingefficiency for the reference instrument must be checkedby the manufacturer against a calibrated standard, suchas a calibrated aerosol electrometer.7.2 Coincidence error in either the CNC or thereference instrument causes inaccuracy in the measuredparticle concentration. The concentration limit for eachinstrument must be obtained from the manufacturersspecifications. The particle concentration in the aerosolstandard must be kept below both concentration limits.7.3 When an aerosol electrometer is used as thereference instrument, the minimum detectable particleconcentration must be obtained from the manufacturersspecifications. A particle concentration below theminimum detectable value will cause inaccurate results.The particle concentration in the aerosol standard mustbe kept above the minimum detectable particleconcentration.7.4 The transport loss of particles from the EC to theCNC, and from the EC to the reference instrument mustbe checked.

For the purpose of this test HCl is thepreferred test gas, however this test can also beperformed with other gasses. This test methoddescribes a corrosive gas exposure test for mass flowcontrollers. The test is intended to accelerate thecorrosion while simulating conditions that may befound within process equipment and gas systems in thesemiconductor industry. As the relationship betweencorrosion and performance may differ with MFCdesign, corrosion is not measured directly. The effectsof corrosion are detected by observing changes in MFCcalibration and other operating parameters.2.2 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This test method should not be expected to yieldcomparable quantitative results from one test facility toanother.3.2 Results may be compromised by the methods usedto construct the apparatus.3.3 This test is designed to be a de structive test. TheMFC tested will be destroyed. This test is intendedonly for MFCs manufactured for use in HCl or a similarhighly corrosive gaseous environment. MFCsmanufactured for non-corrosive service may developleaks or other catastrophic failures if tested by thismethod. For practical reasons in constructing and operating the test bed, test samples may be limited to100 sccm N 2 equivalent full scale (FS) flow.3.4 This method does not measure corrosion directlyby analyzing or inspecting the gas-wetted surfacesfollowing exposure to a corrosive. No attempt is madeto detect particles in the exit gas stream resulting fromthe corrosion process. 4 Referenced DocumentsSEMI F1  Specification for Leak Integrity of High-Purity Gas Piping Systems and ComponentsNOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 5 Terminology5.1 Acronyms and Abbreviations5.1.1 DUT  device under test5.1.2 FS  full scale5.1.3 kPa  kiloPascal5.1.4 MFC  mass flow controller5.1.5 MFM  mass flow meter5.1.6 ppbv  parts per billion by vo lume5.1.7 ppmv  parts per million by v olume5.1.8 sccm  standard cubic centim eters per minuteusing a standard temperature of 0\xb0 C and a standardpressure of 101.32 kPa.5.2 Definitions5.2.1 actual flow  for the purpose of this standard,the output value of the reference flowmeter.5.2.2 ambient temperature  the te mperature of themedium surrounding the device.

The test MFC is monitored over timefor changes in performance resulting from corrosion.6.2 This test is intended to be an a cceleratedsimulation of the effects of alternating corrosive andmoisture-exposure conditions.

A dry N2 purgeseparates each MFC's exposure to the corrosive gas andto the moisture-containing gas. This purging favorsMFC designs that perform well in corrosive servicebecause those MFCs can be dried out quickly withlimited purging.6.3 This method is expected to yie ld data that can beused to compare the relative performance ofcomponents tested for the purpose of qualification. 7 Interferences7.1 Portions of the gas system exp osed to HCl mayrequire replacement or cleaning and refurbishmentbetween test sequences to avoid invalidating subsequenttests by prematurely contaminating DUTs.

Each gas can be valved through the DUTindividually with minimal cross contamination. TheDUT actively controls the gas flow in each case. Thegas then flows into either a scrubbed exhaust system forsafe disposal or a reclamation system. A referenceflowmeter in the dry N2 supply line is used to detectchanges in calibration of the DUT when dry N 2 isflowing in series through both devices.11.2 Setup and Schematic  See F igure 1 for aschematic of the test apparatus. This schematic maynot show in detail all the components required in anactual system.11.3 Supply the manufacturer's reco mmended powerto the DUT. Provide MFC setpoint and purgecommand (if available). Monitor the following:11.3.1 DUT setpoint input.11.3.2 DUT indicated flow output.11.3.3 DUT valve drive output (if ava ilable)11.3.4 actual flow (output of referenc e flowmeter)11.4 Verify that the proper moisture levels exist ineach of the test gases.11.5 Provide a purge flow loop that maintains aconstant flow of dry N 2 in the line from the DUT to theexhaust system. Flow in this loop must be sufficient toprevent back diffusion into the DUT of moisturegenerated in the exhaust system, particularly when flowinto the DUT is shut off for measuring zero.11.6 If the moisture generator is sup plied from thesame N 2 source that supplies the dry N 2, takeprecautions to avoid the diffusion of moisture from themoisture generator into the dry N 2 line. Suchprecautions may include the use of separate pressureregulators and other valving.11.7 Moisture generators typically t ake time tostabilize. A continuous flow should be maintainedthrough the moisture generator during the test tomaintain a stable moisture flow. This may requirediverting the output flow to a vent when not flowingthrough the DUT.11.8 Periodically verify the moistur e concentration ofwet N 2 with a suitable moisture analyzer. 11.9 Follow manufacturer set-up pr ocedures for allequipment.11.10 Conduct the test at an ambient temperature of 22\xb1 2\xb0C.11.11 The DUT moisture generator, f lowmeters, andother instrumentation should have been stabilized atroom temperature for 24 hours before beginning thetests. It is not necessary to flow gas during thisstabilization time.11.12 All portions of the plumbing s ystem that couldcontain HCl must be helium leak tested per SEMI F1before introducing HCl into the system. Whenchanging the DUT or other components, at least thoseportions of the system that were changed must be re-tested.NOTE 4: Small leaks in a corrosive gas system can becomemuch larger without warning. 12 Calibration and Standardi zation12.1 Calibrate all instrumentation u sing currentstandards that are traceable to an appropriate standardslaboratory. In the absence of appropriate standards, usemanufacturer recommendations for calibration. 13 ProcedureNOTE 5: Refer to Figure 2 for a flowchart of the followingtest. 13.1 Set the pressure of each of the HCl and Dry N 2gas sources at 140 kPa \xb1 5%. Set the pressure of theN2 to the moisture generator to the appropriate valuerecommended by the manufacturer. If the test must berun at some other pressure, because of a limitation ofthe DUT, report this fact in the test results.13.2 Start the wet N 2 flow to vent o r through themoisture analyzer. Establish a stable moistureconcentration at 100 ppmv \xb1 20% before beginning thetest sequence. Set the wet N2 to flow within \xb1 5% ofthe DUT flow that will be run during the test.13.3 Place the DUT control valve in the purge or fullyopen position by supplying a purge command or a200% setpoint. Purge with dry N 2 at a rate of one totwo times FS flow for one hour to establish initialconditions. The purge rate is controlled by adjustingthe supply pressure and is monitored by a purge-rateflowmeter located in the gas-supply path. Follow themanufacturer's procedure for fully opening the DUTcontrol valve.13.4 Provide a setpoint to the DUT for 80 \xb1 5% of FSflow.13.5 Determining the Test Baseline and MeasurementRepeatability."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 16 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F55-0600 \xa9 SEMI 2000 4 NOTE 6: Data throughout this test may be recorded in aformat similar to that found in Table A1.1. 13.6 Open valve V1 and flow dry N 2 at a setpoint of80% \xb1 5% of the DUT FS and wait 10 minutes.13.7 Record:13.7.1 DUT setpoint13.7.2 DUT indicated flow13.7.3 DUT valve drive output (if ava ilable)13.7.4 Actual flow13.8 Stop flow by closing V1.

The test shall endwhen a \xb13% of full-scale output flow change is notedbetween the flow at the reference voltage and at anincremental change point. A flow chart outlines theprocedure (see Figure 1). 7 Interferences7.1 Because of fluctuations in amb ient temperature ora changing load on the power supply, the referencesteady-state supply voltages may change. Thesechanges in supply voltages may adversely effect theMFC's ability to deliver setpoint flow. The magnitudeof this effect can be measured by this test method.7.2 The user of an MFC can use th e data generated bythis method to evaluate the impact of steady-statesupply voltage variations on the MFC's ability todeliver setpoint flow values.

For example an o-ring in a unionmust not degrade the overall quality of the union suchthat it fails to meet the requirements of this document.Components and spare parts purchased separately, suchas gaskets and O-rings, must meet this standard, ifapplicable.2.4 This document and associated tests specify wettedstream performance requirements for polymercomponents in an as supplied, native state and reflectthe current capabilities of the manufacturers ofpolymer components.2.5 Leach out tests and associated requirementsreferenced within this document provide values fromstatic, not dynamic, conditions. To determine thecorresponding concentration that may result in a flow-ing dynamic stream, please see the Related InformationSection on Theoretical Dynamic Concentration (TDC)located at the end of this document.2.6 Polymer Materials2.6.1 It is the intent of this specifica tion to focuscomponent qualification on performance. However, adiscussion of recommended materials may benefit thereader and is therefore included.2.6.2 Care must be taken to ensure t hat the materialsare compatible with the liquid streams (as shown inSection 2.2) for long term applications. Additionally, itis important that the materials used be compatible withthe application temperature and/or methods for bacterialreduction such as ozone, UV light and/or hydrogenperoxide.2.6.3 The requirements of this speci fication oftenmandate the use of existing materials of choice, such ashigh purity grades of perfluoroalkoxy (PFA),polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF). However, unique design specifica-tions or new materials may result in instances wheresignificant efficiencies may be achieved whilemaintaining substantially equivalent performance withregard to this specification. These scenarios couldresult in the use of new or existing materials such asethylenechlorotrifluoroethylene (ECTFE), polyether-etherketone (PEEK), polypropylene (PP), acetal resin(such as Delrin\xae\u2122 1, Celcon\xae\u2122 1 and others),polyvinyl chloride (PVC), perfluoromethylether-basedperfluoroalkoxy (MFA), etc. 1 Delrin is a trademark of DuPont; Celcon is a trademark of HoechstCelanese. 2.6.4 Due to purity and traceability i ssues, reprocessedor regrind material must not be used.2.7 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This document applies solely t o polymercomponents.

The polymercomponents described within this document are NOTintended for use with such organic liquids.3.4 Polymer components describe d within thisdocument are intended for use in UHP service only.Their specified performance requirements may exceedthe needs of components used in drainage and otherlesser quality liquids.3.5 This standard is not intended t o address design ormaterials issues related to safety which are addressedelsewhere in the SEMI guidelines (see SEMI S2).3.6 The tests referenced in this doc ument are designedto assess contamination from the polymer componentsin an as received state. Assembly steps, such aswelding and cleaning, may actually add somecontaminants.

R1-1 TDC Definition and CalculationR1-1.1 For purposes of demonstrating a theoreticalmathematical relationship between the maximumallowed static leach out values (provided in thisspecification) and a corresponding concentration whichmay result in a flowing stream, this related informationon Theoretical Dynamic Concentration (TDC) is beingprovided.R1-1.2 The Static Value as defined in this document(see Section 7.3.4) is a measure of the weeklyaccumulated mass transfer of contaminant (contaminantflux per week) from the material being tested into staticultrapure water (UPW). The value is calculated basedupon measurement of total leached mass of acontaminant per unit area of the surface that was wettedin the test apparatus. Since the duration of the statictest is fixed at 7 days, the information is simplyreported as mass/area (Tables 3, 4, and 5 use units ofg/m2).R1-1.3 The Theoretical Dynamic Concentration (TDC)is a mathematical conversion of the static value into atheoretical prediction of concentration of a contaminantincorporated into the flowing liquid by contact with thecontaminant generating (or transmitting) polymercomponent wall. The conversion depends upon amodel which assumes a uniform rate of contaminantgeneration that is equal to the average rate over the 7day Static Value test (7d ","*"," 24 hr/d ","*"," 3600 sec/hr = 6.05x 10 5 sec). The model also assumes a non-depletingsource of the contaminant in steady state transportconditions through the component/liquid interface. Ingeneral, this assumption is only true early in the life ofthe piping system installation. Values have been foundto decrease in time. Calculation of TDC forspecification limit purposes can be derived by dividingthe static value limit for the component (adjusted forwetted surface area of the component) by the volume ofliquid affected by contact with the component.

Current edition approved by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on August 28, 2000. Initially available on SEMI OnLine August 2000; to be publishedOctober 2000. 1 Purpose1.1 This document describes the p rocedure fordetermination of the moisture dry-down characteristics(quantity of removable moisture) of surface mountedand conventional gas distribution systems (integratedgas distribution systems). APIMS is currently themethod of choice for such dynamic tests because it isthe commercially available technique capable of pptmoisture analysis with the fastest response time. Thistest method may provide guidelines for the applicationof other techniques with similar detection limits andresponse time to APIMS which are not commerciallyavailable at this time.1.2 The results of this test can be u sed for qualitativeranking of gas delivery based on the design. It can alsobe used by a sufficiently sophisticated user as input fornumerical simulation of distribution system behavior. 2 Scope2.1 This test method applies to all types of surfacemounted and conventional gas distribution systemsused in semiconductor processing.2.2 Test Medium  The test proce dure will be carriedout in nitrogen. Other inert gases will have differentpurging characteristics and may dry a system morequickly or slowly. Reactive gases may react chemicallywith moisture. Considerations relating to corrosionresistance are outside the scope of the presentdocument, although the test procedure may prove usefulin corrosion studies. The results will provide a rankingwith respect to moisture contribution arising as a resultof differences in design, which may be applied with duecaution to systems intended for use in other gasapplications.2.3 Operating Situations  Moist ure contributionfrom a gas delivery system may be the result ofcontamination arising in its manufacture, or fromsubsequent exposure to ambient air or non-dry gas.Thus, it is necessary to consider two main situations: 2.3.1 The initial dry-down situatio n, which isdetermined by the moisture content of the componentsin the system (as received) with the effects ofmanufacturing process and design, surface quality, pre-treatment and packaging convoluted together.2.3.2 The response to upset situati on, which isdetermined by the amount of moisture taken up by thesystem and subsequently released in any exposure afterreceipt.2.4 Safety Issues  This standard does not purport toaddress safety issues, if any, associated with its use. Itis the responsibility of the users of this standard toestablish appropriate safety and health practices anddetermine the applicability of regulatory limitationsprior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This test method allows the de termination ofmoisture interactions which can be used, for example,to rank systems in order of decreasing moistureinteraction. Because different degrees of moistureinteraction are permissible in different situations,selecting the best system requires consideration ofhow they will be used, either qualitatively or through anumerical simulation of distribution system behavior.The results of this test can only be used for qualificationfor gas delivery systems based on different designs. Itcannot be used for production purposes and/orcertification/testing. 4 Referenced StandardsNOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI C15  Test Method for ppm and ppb HumidityStandardsSEMI F27  Test Method for Moisture Interaction andContent of Gas Distribution Systems and Componentsby Atmospheric Pressure Ionization Mass Spectrometry(APIMS)"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 42 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F58-1000 \xa9 SEMI 2000 2 SEMI F33  Method for Calibration of AtmosphericPressure Ionization Mass Spectrometer (APIMS) 4.2 ASTM Standards1ASTM-F1397-93  Standard Test Method forDetermination of Moisture Contribution by GasDistribution System Components 5 Summary of Test Method5.1 This test method consists of in itial drydown andmoisture input tests for both surface-mounted andconventional gas delivery systems. 6 Terminology6.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms6.1.1 APIMS  Atmospheric Pressu re IonizationMass Spectrometry.6.1.2 EPSS  electropolished stain less steel.6.1.3 ppm  molar parts per million (mole/mole).The same as ppmv.6.1.4 ppb  molar parts per billion (nmole/mole).

Calibration of the APIMS shall beperformed as per SEMI F33, one at the beginning andone at the end of the series. These calibrations shallboth be made under the same analytical conditions(flow, pressures, plate voltages, etc.) as the tests and theresults shall be within 5% of each other. Provided thiscondition is met, the interval between calibrations maybe left to the discretion of the operator; however, it issuggested that calibration should be carried outwhenever the equipment is moved and/or every twoweeks of operation.7.2 Dry Gas and Moisture Genera tor  A source ofextremely dry nitrogen (less than 200 ppt moisture) anda moisture generator capable of delivering up to 13slpm nitrogen doped with 200 ppb moisture is required.This generator may be the same as used to calibrate theAPIMS. The output of the generator shall be verifiedaccording to SEMI C15.7.2.1 Most ultra-high purity gas pan els are currentlyfitted with metal gasket type connectors. The same typeof connector should, therefore, be incorporated into thetest bench for connection to the test system.7.3 Test Blank  Any series of tes ts shall include theresults of testing a blank. The blank shall be the shortestconvenient length (no more than 1 m) of 1/4" EPSS tu-bing with suitable fittings and/or adapters at either endto enable it to be inserted in place of the test system.7.4 Moisture Pulse Generator  A valve arrangementcapable of switching instantaneously between dry andhumidified nitrogen is also required. An example ofsuch a design is shown in Figure 1. In this design, flowis maintained in both the humidified and dry gas lines atall times. By simultaneously switching valves V 1 andV 3, or V 2 and V 3, either humidified or dry gas isdirected through the test system while the other gasstream is directed to vent. Note that there is a bypassloop so that flow can be maintained to the APIMS whenthe test system is removed. In this design, all gas lines,but especially those lines between V1 and V 3 andbetween V 2 and V 3, should be as short as possible andconstructed of EPSS tubing of high quality.Maintaining gas lines at a constant temperature between50 and 80C wherever possible is also recommended.7.4.1 The bypass loop will contain a stagnant volumeof gas during testing. To avoid exposing the APIMS toa large moisture upset whenever it is fed with the gascontained in the bypass loop, the loop should bethoroughly baked out (at \u2265 200\xb0C) and protected fromatmospheric contamination thereafter. Valve V 4 should'),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 43 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F58-1000 \xa9 SEMI 20003 be such that some flow can be maintained through thebypass loop and the test system simultaneously as wellas through each separately. Use of pneumatic valves tofacilitate rapid and simultaneous switching isrecommended.7.4.2 Other arrangements than that s hown may also beused. The moisture pulse generator should be designedso as to give the fastest possible response of the blankto a change in input moisture level.7.5 Temperature Control and Mea surement  Astable temperature during the test is of critical import-ance. The test system shall be kept at 30C. TESTS ATDIFFERENT TEMPERATURES CANNOT BECOMPARED. Ideally, the blank and test system shouldbe maintained in a temperature-controlled chamber.However, if this is impractical, a heating tape can beused. Temperature control should be to \xb1 1C. Acontinuous record of temperature during the test shallbe maintained. 8 Procedure8.1 Blank Tests  A blank test sha ll be carried outafter each calibration. If initial dry-down testing ofsystem is not of interest, the initial dry-down test of thetest blank may be omitted and the test blank brought toequilibrium with zero gas in whatever manner is mostconvenient, except that the test blank should not beheated above 200C. Permanent changes in moistureinteraction have been observed at temperatures abovethis level.8.1.1 Initial Dry-down  Start the e xperiment with theblank in place of the test system and a flow of dry gasthrough the APIMS. The APIMS output should be atequilibrium with the lowest moisture level of interest,and in any case no higher than 200 ppt.8.1.1.1 Switch the gas flow to pass pri marily throughthe bypass loop while maintaining a small flow throughthe test blank. Remove the test blank completely fromthe system. If a glove box or other such enclosure isused, do not remove the test blank from the glove box.Immediately reconnect the test blank to V4, leaving itdisconnected from V5. Allow dry nitrogen to flowthrough the test blank for five minutes to purge the airfrom inside before reconnecting to V5. Switch the gas toflow only through the blank and not through the bypassloop. The APIMS will show an increase in moistureconcentration. Record the APIMS output until itreaches 800 ppt or 48 hours, whichever is less.8.1.1.2 Repeat the above test twice for a total of threedata sets. 8.2 Tests on Actual Test System8.2.1 Initial Dry-down  This porti on of the test isdesigned to determine the quantity of removablemoisture on the wetted surfaces of the system in thecondition in which it is typically supplied. Thus, theresults of this test will reflect, by design, anyprecautions which the supplier has taken to removemoisture and maintain its dryness during shipping.8.2.1.1 Start the test as in Section 8.1. 1. The testsystem should not be unpacked until after the APIMShas equilibrated with the background moisture level. Ifa glove box or other such enclosure is used, unpack thesystem in the glove box. Switch the dry nitrogen flowto pass through the bypass loop while maintaining asmall flow through the test blank. Bake the sample lineto APIMS at 170\xb0C for 10 min and the APIMS ionchamber at 150\xb0C for 10 min. Undo the final layer ofpacking and any shipping caps or plugs on the system atthis point. Remove the sample blank and connect thetest system to valve V4 as quickly as possible. Ensurethat the gas lines going to APIMS will be under N 2purge during the removal of test blank and installationof test system. Allow the dry nitrogen flow to purge outany ambient air in the system for five minutes, thenconnect the system to V 5. Switch the gas to flow (1.2slpm) only through the test system and not through thebypass loop. The APIMS will show an increase inmoisture concentration. Record the APIMS output untilit reaches 200 ppt or for 2448 hours, whichever is less.8.2.1.2 After 2448 hours, the initial d ry-down part ofthe test can be terminated. Remove the filters from thetest system and install special spool pieces. This is donesince filters have a large surface area and woulddominate the dry-down performance.8.2.2 Moisture Input Test  Flow 1 .2 slpm of drynitrogen gas (200 ppt moisture) through appropriateprocess channels of the test system. Connect the outletof the gas panel to the sample line connecting to theAPIMS. Bake the appropriate process channels usingheater tapes at 60\xb0C for 12 h to remove atmosphericcontamination.8.2.2.1 At the conclusion of baking, e quilibrate the testsystem to 30\xb0C. Bake the sample line at 170\xb0C for 10min and ion source of APIMS at 150\xb0C for 10 min.Perform a leak check at the inlet and outlet connectionsof the test system using 1% methane gas in nitrogen,after warming up the APIMS for 30 min. Switch theinput gas to nitrogen with 200 ppb moisture (byswitching valves V 1, V 2, and V 3 simultaneously, if thearrangement shown in Figure 1 is used) while recordingthe APIMS response. Maintain this input for 20 minand then switch the input gas to dry nitrogen (200 pptmoisture) and monitor the dry-down."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 44 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F58-1000 \xa9 SEMI 2000 4 9 Reporting Results9.1 Complete moisture response c urves for all testsystems and relevant test blanks should be included.

Application of this test method isexpected to yield comparable data among filters or gassystems.1.2 This document establishes a test method forpreparing a pressure drop versus flow rate curves forfilters and gas systems. 2 Scope2.1 This procedure applies to clean filters includingthose cartridges of metal, ceramic and membraneconstruction. The pressure drops for integralhousing/cartridge combination units are determined as asingle set of values. For housings with removable filtercartridges, the flow curves of the housing andhousing/cartridge combination are determinedseparately.2.2 This procedure applies to high-purity gas systems.This procedure applies to face-seal, surface mountmodular, and monolithic integrated gas systems.2.3 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate and safety health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 For separable filtration units, a single cartridgepressure drop value cannot be combined to give thepressure drop value for an extended length cartridge,because of the limitations imposed by a common outletport for the assembly.3.2 This method is written with the assumption that theoperator understands the use of the apparatus at a levelequivalent to six months of experience.3.3 This method is written to test a filter under normal operating conditions. It does not prescribe a procedurefor reverse flow testing since operation of the filter inthis manner is not recommended by the manufacturers.3.4 Components that induce line pressure changes on asystem such as pressure regulators, and MFCs are notconsidered in this test method.3.5 Proper flow of low vapor pressure gases can beeffected by small pressure drops and may need to beevaluated independently. 4 Referenced StandardsNOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall bethe latest publications of adopted standards.4.1 ASME Performance Test Code PTC 19.5, 1972 Applications.

Examplesof such a test stand are shown in Figures 1a or 1b asschematic drawings.12.2 The gas supply is filtered by an electronics gradehigh purity point-of-use gas filter before it is deliveredto the DUT through a pressure regulator.12.3 A flow meter can be installed either upstream ordownstream of the DUT. See Figures 1a or 1b. Thetest filter is upstream of a throttle valve to allow forcontrol of the flow through the DUT.12.4 Inlet pressure is measured immediately upstreamof the DUT by a pressure gauge or pressure transducer.12.5 Pressure drop across the test specimen ismeasured by an electronic differential pressuretransducer capable of reading 0.67 kPa (0.1 psid) acrossthe test device.12.6 Flow measurements are carried out through a flowmeter installed upstream or downstream of the testfilter. See Figures 1a or 1b.NOTE 2: The flow measurement can be influenced by bothupstream and downstream pressure fluctuations. It isnecessary to verify the accuracy of any flow measurementunder the test conditions used to complete this testing.12.7 A temperature measurement device can beinstalled in the test stand to measure the gas streamtemperature.12.8 Figure 2 gives the piping requirements for the teststand configuration.12.9 Figure 3 gives the recommended pressureconnection to be followed in constructing the testapparatus. 13 Calibration and Standardization13.1 For each test, verify that calibration of testequipment is up-to-date.13.2 A series of flow meters should be used to coverthe full range of flows that will be tested. 14 Procedure14.1 Integral Filtration Unit14.1.1 Assemble the filtration unit into the testapparatus.
