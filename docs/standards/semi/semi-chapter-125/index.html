TEST METHOD FOR JUNCTION-TO-CASE THERMAL RESISTANCE
MEASUREMENTS OF MOLDED PLASTIC PACKAGES
1  Purpose
The  purpose  of  this  test  is  to  determine  the  thermal
resistance of molded plastic packages using thermal test
chips. This test method deals only with junction-to-case
measurements  of  thermal  resistance  and  limits  itself  to
fluid    bath    testing    environments.    For    this    test,
conduction   through   the   leads   is   minimized,   thus
providing   information   on   the   ability   of   the   plastic
package    material    to    dissipate    heat.    Due    to    the
thermophysical  properties  of  the  heat  transfer  fluids
used and the effects of the variable nature of the fluid-
stirring   and   package-mounting   procedures,   this   test
method should only be used for comparing the thermal
characteristics of plastic packages in the same fluid bath
system.

2. 1  SEMI Specification
SEMI  G32  —  Guideline  for  Unencapsulated  Thermal
Test Chip
3  Definitions
The  following  definitions  and  symbols  shall  apply  for
the purpose of this test:
case  temperature,  T
C
—  in  degrees  Celsius.  The  case
temperature is the temperature at a specified accessible
reference    point    on    the    package    in    which    the
microelectronic chip is mounted.
junction  temperature,  T
J
—  in  degrees  Celsius.  The
term   is   used   to   denote   the   temperature   of   the
semiconductor junction in the microcircuit in which the
major part of the heat is generated. For purposes of this
test,    the    measured    junction    temperature    is    only
indicative  of  the  temperature  in  the  immediate  vicinity
of the element used to sense the temperature.
power dissipation, P
H
— in watts, is the heating power
applied  to  the  device  causing  a  junction-to-reference
point temperature difference.
thermal   resistance,   junction   to   specified   reference
point,  R
θJR
—  in  degrees  Celsius/watt.  The  thermal
resistance   of   the   microcircuit   is   the   temperature
difference from the junction to some reference point on
the package divided by the power dissipation P
H
.
temperature-sensitive      parameter,      TSP      —      the
temperature-dependent  electrical  characteristic  of  the
junction under test which can be calibrated with respect
to  temperature  and  subsequently  used  to  detect  the
junction temperature of interest.
4  Apparatus
The  apparatus  required  for  these  tests  shall  include  the
following as applicable to the specified test procedures:
a.   Thermocouple  material  shall  be  copper-constantan
(type  T)  or  equivalent,  for  the  temperature  range
-100  to  +  300°C.  The  wire  size  shall  be  no  larger
than    AWG    size    30.    The    junction    of    the
thermocouple shall be welded to form a bead rather
than   soldered   or   twisted.   The   accuracy   of   the
thermocouple   and   associated   measuring   system
shall be ± 0.5°C.
b.   Suitable electrical equipment as required to provide
controlled levels of conditioning power and to make
the specified measurements. The instrument used to
electrically     measure     the     temperature-sensitive
parameter  shall  be  capable  of  resolving  a  voltage
change of 0.5 mV.
c.   Controlled   temperature   chamber   or   fluid   bath
capable of maintaining the specified reference point
temperature   to   within   ±   0.5°C   of   the   preset
(measured)  value.  A  typical  temperature-controlled
fluid   bath   assembly   is   presented   for   illustrative
purposes only.
4. 1   Fluid  Bath  Assembly  —  A  typi cal  temperature-
controlled  fluid  bath  for  thermally  characterizing  the
microelectronic device under test is shown in Figure 1.
In  this  figure,  the  package  is  mounted  in  a  fluid  bath
separate  from  the  fluid  circulator,  although  it  can  be
immersed  directly  in  an  integrated  fluid  circulator/bath
unit.  The  fluid  in  the  bath  should  be  continuously
stirred  or  agitated  to  ensure  the  required  temperature
stability  and  uniformity.  Since  this  working  fluid  is
being  used  as  an  infinite  heat-sink,  the  case-to-fluid
(ambient)     temperature     difference     at     the     case
temperature   reference   point   of   interest   should   be
minimized,  i.e.,  ≤  20°C.  For  case-to-fluid  temperature
differences    &gt;    20°C,    accuracy    and    repeatability
difficulties    may    occur    due    to    a    large    variable
temperature gradient in the fluid film boundary layer at
the     package-fluid     interface.     The     case-to-fluid
temperature difference can be minimized by increasing</p><p>SEMI G43-87 © SEMI 1986, 19872
the  fluid  velocity  and  by  decreasing  the  power  density
seen by the fluid.
The device under test should be mounted such that heat
transfer to the fluid is not impeded. For leaded devices,
the leads should be oriented in such a manner so as not
to  interfere  with  the  heat  transfer  to  the  fluid  and
provide  freedom  to  any  thermal  currents  caused  by  the
power dissipation within the package. The microcircuit
package shall be mounted such that conduction cooling
through  the  leads  or  test  socket  or  both  shall  be  small
compared   to   the   other   cooling   mechanisms.   To
minimize conduction through the leads, a special socket
jig that connects No. 36 AWG wire to the device socket
should be used.
The case temperature of the device under test should be
measured  with  a  thermocouple  that  is  attached  to  the
package/lead  and  should  not  be  assumed  to  be  at  the
fluid  temperature.  The  working  fluid  should  have  a
thermal   conductivity   at   25°C   of   at   least   0.0006
W/cm°C.  Working  fluids  such  as  inert  fluorocarbon
liquids and silicone oils are suitable as cooling media.
5  Procedure
5. 1      Direct     Measurement     of     Refere nce     Point
Temperature, T
R
= T
c
— For the purpose of measuring
a    microelectronic    device    thermal    resistance,    the
reference  point  temperature  shall  be  measured  at  the
package   location   of   highest   temperature   which   is
accessible  from  outside  the  package.  This  reference
point  location  is  determined  with  the  device  operating
in free air and with no external heat-sinking. In general,
this reference point is found to be on the surface of the
body of the package, or on a lead near the body, in the
major path of heat flow from the chip heating surface to
the  ambient  fluid.  The  package  surface  may  be  altered
to   facilitate   this   measurement   provided   that   such
alteration does not affect the original heat transfer paths
and,  hence,  the  thermal  resistance,  within  the  package
by more than a few percent.
5. 1.1   Case  Temperature,  T
c
—  The   microelectronic
device  under  test  shall  be  mounted  under  specified
conditions  so  that  the  case  temperature  can  be  held  at
the  specified  value.  A  thermocouple  shall  be  attached
on the surface of the device package directly under the
chip   (i.e.,   on   the   base   plane   of   the   package).   A
conducting  epoxy  may  be  used  for  this  purpose.  The
thermocouple   bead   should   be   in   direct   mechanical
contact  with  the  package  of  the  microelectronic  device
under  test.  Care  should  be  taken  to  minimize  exposure
of   the   thermocouple   bead   to   the   high   temperature
gradient in the fluid film boundary layer at the package-
fluid interface.
If it is found that attaching the thermocouple directly to
the  case  is  impractical,  an  alternate  approach  using  a
thermocouple  welded  to  one  side  of  a  thin  metal  disk
should  be  used.  This  can  be  accomplished  by  parallel
gap welding the crossed thermocouple wires to one side
of  a  0.25  cm  (0.094  in)  diameter,  0.02  cm  (0.008  in)
thick  beryllium-copper  disk  and  then,  with  a  thin  layer
of  adhesive,  bonding  the  other  side  of  the  disk  to  the
case at the point of interest. The exposed thermocouple
bead/wire  on  the  disk  shall  be  covered  with  epoxy  or
silicone  rubber.  The  attached  thermocouple  should  not
unduly interfere with heat transfer to the fluid.
5. 2  Thermal Resistance,      Junction-t o-Specified
Reference Point, R
θJR
5. 2.1     General    Considerations    —    Th e    thermal
resistance of a semiconductor device is a measure of the
ability of its carrier or package and mounting technique
to  provide  for  heat  removal  from  the  semiconductor
junction.  The  thermal  resistance  of  a  microelectronic
device can be calculated when the case temperature and
power  dissipation  in  the  device  and  a  measurement  of
the junction temperature are known.
When making the indicated measurements, the package
shall    be    considered    to    have    achieved    thermal
equilibrium   when   halving   the   time   between   the
application  of  power  and  the  taking  of  the  reading
causes  no  error  in  the  indicated  results  within  the
required accuracy of measurement.
5. 2.2   Indirect  Measurement  of  Junct ion  Temperature
for the Determination of R
θJR
— The purpose of the test
is   to   measure   the   thermal   resistance   of   integrated
circuits  by  using  particular  semiconductor  elements  on
the  chip  to  indicate  the  device  junction  temperature.  In
order  to  obtain  a  realistic  estimate  of  the  operating
junction  temperature,  the  whole  chip  in  the  package
should  be  powered  in  order  to  provide  the  proper
internal  temperature  distribution.  During  measurement
of  the  junction  temperature,  the  chip  heating  power
(constant  voltage  source)  shall  remain  constant  while
the  junction  calibration  current  remains  stable.  It  is
assumed that the calibration current will not be affected
by   the   circuit   operation   during   the   application   of
heating power.
The  temperature-sensitive  device  parameter  is  used  as
an    indicator    of    an    average    (weighted)    junction
temperature    of    the    semiconductor    element    for
calculations   of   thermal   resistance.   The   measured
junction  temperature  is  indicative  of  the  temperature
only  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  element  used  to
sense the temperature.
The      temperature-sensitive      electrical      parameters
generally   used   to   indirectly   measure   the   junction
temperature  are  the  forward  voltage  of  diodes  and  the</p><p>SEMI G43-87 © SEMI 1986, 19873
emitter-base   voltage   of   bipolar   transistors.   Other
appropriate  temperature-sensitive  parameters  may  be
used  for  indirectly  measuring  junction  temperature  for
fabrication  technologies  that  do  not  lend  themselves  to
sensing the active junction voltages.
5. 2.2.1   Steady-State  Technique  for  Me asuring  T
J
—
The  following  symbols  shall  apply  for  the  purpose  of
these measurements:
I
M
— ring current in milliamperes.
V
MH
—  Value  of  temperature-sensitive  parameters  in
millivolts,  measured  at  I
M
,  and  corresponding  to  the
temperature of the junction heated by P
H
.
T
MC
—  Calibration  temperature  in  degrees  Celsius,
measured at the reference point.
V
MC
—  Value  of  temperature-sensitive  parameter  in
millivolts, measured at I
M
and specific value of T
MC
.
The measurement of T
J
using  junction  forward  voltage
as the TSP is made in the following manner:
Step  1  —  Measurement  of  the  temperature  coefficient
of the TSP (calibration).
The  coefficient  of  the  temperature-sensitive  parameter
is  generated  by  measuring  the  TSP  as  a  function  of  the
reference  point  temperature,  for  a  specified  constant
measuring  current,  I
M
,  by  externally  heating  the  device
under  test  in  an  oven  or  in  a  fluid  bath.  The  reference
point  temperature  range  used  during  calibration  shall
encompass  the  temperature  range  encountered  in  the
power  application  test  (see  Step  2).  The  measuring
current is generally chosen such that the TSP decreases
linearly  with  increasing  temperature  over  the  range  of
interest and that negligible internal heating occurs in the
silicon  and  metal  traces.  For  determining  the  optimum
TSP  calibration  or  measuring  current,  V
MC
vs.  log  I
M
curves  for  two  temperature  levels  that  encompass  the
calibration   temperature   range   of   interest   should   be
plotted.  The  optimum  measuring  current,  I
M
,  is  then
selected such that it resides on the linear portion of the
two  V
MC
vs.  log  I
M
curves  that  were  generated.  A
measuring   current   ranging   from   0.05   to   5   mA   is
generally  used,  depending  on  the  specifications  and
operating   conditions   of   the   device   under   test,   for
measuring  the  TSP.  The  value  of  the  TSP  temperature
coefficient   V
MC
/T
MC
,   for   the   particular   measuring
current   used   in   the   test,   is   calculated   from   the
calibration  curve,  V
MC
vs.  T
MC
.  At  least  three  points
should  be  used  to  generate  the  voltage  vs.  temperature
curve  for  the  determination  of  the  TSP  temperature
coefficient.
Step 2 — Power application test.
The  power  application  test  is  performed  in  two  parts.
For   both   portions   of   the   test,   the   reference   point
temperature is held constant at a preset value. The first
measurement  to  be  made  is  that  of  the  temperature-
sensitive    parameter,    i.e.,    V
MC
,    under    operating
conditions  with  the  measuring  current,  I
M
,  used  during
the  calibration  procedure.  The  microelectronic  device
under  test  shall  then  be  operated  with  heating  power
(P
H
)   applied.   The   temperature-sensitive   parameter,
V
MH
,   shall   be   measured   with   constant   measuring
current,  I
M
,  that  was  applied  during  the  calibration
procedure (see Step 1).
The  heating  power,  P
H
,  shall  be  chosen  such  that  the
calculated    junction-to-reference    point    temperature
difference   as   measured   at   V
MH
is   ≥   20°C.      In
accomplishing this, the device under test should not be
operated at such a high heating power level that the on-
chip  temperature-sensing  and  heating  circuitry  is  no
longer  electrically  isolated.    Care  should  also  be  taken
not   to   exceed   the   design   ratings   of   the   package-
interconnect    system,    as    this    may    lead    to    an
overestimation  of  the  power  being  dissipated  in  the
active area of the chip due to excessive power losses in
the package leads and wire bonds.  The values of V
MH
,
V
MC
, and P
H
are recorded during the power application
test.
The  following  data  shall  be  recorded  for  these  test
conditions:
a.   Temperature-sensitive   electrical   parameters   (V
F

V

RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR FLASH CHARACTERISTICS OF
THERMOSETTING MOLDING COMPOUNDS
1  Scope
This  method  describes  a  procedure  for  measuring  the
flashing characteristics of semiconductor grade transfer
molding compounds.
2  Significance
2. 1   The  flashing  tendency  for  sem iconductor  grade
molding   compounds   depends   on   the   interaction   of
several  variables,  including  mold  conditions,  process
parameters,  molding  compound  viscosity,  and  curing
characteristics.  This  test  is  not  a  valid  method  for
predicting the flashing performance in all mold types. It
is  a  method  for  comparing  flash  tendency  and  flashing
type  of  different  molding  compounds  when  evaluated
under a specific set of molding process parameters.
2. 2    Flashing   presents   problems   wi th   subsequent
processing of plastic packaged devices after molding. A
high  flashing  tendency  increases  die  wear  in  the  trim
and form operation, may interfere with plating or solder
dip finishing operations, and may prevent good contact
for   electrical   test.   Thus,   reduced   tendency   toward
flashing  will  improve  the  plastic  package  subassembly
operations.  The  information  from  this  test  will  be  of
value   in   rating   flash   performance   of   any   given
compound to that in production use.
3  Apparatus
3. 1    Transfer   molding   press   with   a    platen   area
sufficient  to  maintain  a  uniform  mold  temperature  and
having  (1)  a  transfer  piston  pressure  potential  of  1000
psi  on  the  material;  (2)  sufficient  clamping  pressure  to
prevent flashing of the molding compound at clamping
lands; and (3) a minimum plunger speed of 25.4 mm (1
inch)  per  second  without  load.  The  pot  diameter  shall
be 31.75 to 44.45 ± 0.735 mm (1.250 to 1.750 ± 0.025
inch)  and  the  clearance  between  pot  and  ram  shall  be
sufficiently small that flashing does not occur above the
first sealing groove on the ram.
3. 2  Standard Flash Test Mold — P er Figure 1.
3. 3    Force   Gauge   —   With   appropr iate   range   to
calibrate  transfer  pressure  to  minimum  of  10.343  mpa
(1,500 psi).
3. 4  Steel Rule — Measured in 0.25  mm (0.010 in).
3. 5  Halo Lamp — 3× magnificatio n, minimum.
3. 6  Thermocouple and/or Pyrome ter Calibrated — In
the 160°–190°C range (calibration to be checked every
6 months).
4  Test Conditions
4. 1   Molding  Compounds  —  Refrig erated  shipment
and  storage  of  some  molding  compounds  is  necessary.
The  molding  compound  is  to  be  at  room  temperature
before  the  container  is  opened.  Care  must  be  taken  to
preserve  the  original  moisture  content.  The  material
should    be    in    powdered    form,    unless    otherwise
specified.
4. 2   Flash  Test  Mold  —  Shall  be  cl ean  and  free  from
any mold release agents or lubricants. A standard mold
cleaning   compound   can   be   used   to   insure   mold
cleanliness.
4. 3  Molding Conditions
4. 3.1   The  temperature  of  the  mold  s hall  be  measured
using  a  thermocouple  inserted  in  the  mold  or  with  a
surface  pyrometer.  The  ram  shall  be  kept  at  the  mold
temperature. Molding temperature is to be 175°C unless
otherwise  specified.  Temperature  must  be  maintained
within ± 3°C (± 5°F) of the specified temperature.
4. 3.2  The transfer pressure for test, a s measured under
the transfer plunger, is to be 6.895 ± 0.177 mpa (1000 ±
25 psi) unless otherwise specified.
4. 3.3   The  weight  of  the  charge  shall   be  adjusted  to
give  a  molded  cull  thickness  of  3.303  ±  0.254  mm
(0.130 ± 0.010&quot;) excluding vertical flash.
4. 3.4  The free running ram speed sh all be at least 25.4
mm/sec  (1&quot;/sec).  Recommended  speed  is  100  ±  25
mm/sec  into  the  pot  and  application  of  pressure  on  the
charge shall be maintained throughout the mold cycle.
4. 3.5   Unless  otherwise  specified,  a  m inimum  of  1.5
minutes close and cure time shall be used.
4. 3.6   Flash  length  shall  be  measured   in  0.25  mm
(0.010 in) intervals.
5  Procedure
5. 1   Thoroughly  clean  the  ram,  pot ,  and  mold  of  any
cured compound, or other foreign matter.
5. 2   Heat  the  mold  and  ram  to  with in  ±  3°C  of  the
specified temperature.</p><p>SEMI G45-93 © SEMI 1986, 19932
5. 3  At the beginning of each series  of tests and at each
change   of   compound,   check   and   set   the   transfer
pressure using the force gauge. The proper force gauge
setting can be determined from the formula:
F=
ΠD
2
P
4
where F is the force in pounds, P is the desired pressure
on  the  material  in  psi,  and  D  is  the  ram  diameter  in
inches.
5. 4
For each material change, mak e at least three clean
out runs using the material to be tested before recording
data.  These  runs  may  be  used  to  determine  the  charge
weight.
5. 5
Weigh  out  the  compound  to  th e  nearest  0.1  g  as
previously  determined  to  yield  a  cull  of  3.302  ±  0.254
mm (0.130 ± 0.010 in).
5. 6
Raise  the  ram,  add  the  compou nd  to  the  pot,  and
immediately activate the transfer cycle.
5. 7
Remove  cull  and  measure  thic kness.  If  the  cull  is
not within 0.130 ± 0.010 in, discard the run and repeat
the test, adjusting the charge weight as necessary.
5. 8
Open  mold  and  measure  longe st  flash  for  each
channel   to   nearest   0.25   mm   (0.010   in)   using   3×
minimum magnification. Be sure to check both top and
bottom plates of mold before measuring flash.
NOTE:  Care  must  be  taken  to  include  the  measurement  of
transparent  and  semi-transparent  flash  which  may  be  present
in  the  smaller  channel.  After  measurements,  diligence  is
required  to  remove  all  flash,  including  the  transparent  and
semi-transparent varieties prior to the next test.
5. 9   Repeat  Steps  5.6  through  5.8  a t  least  3  times  for
repeatability.
6  Reporting of Results
6. 1  Report the material designatio n and lot number.
6. 2
Report  the  average  and  standa rd  deviation  of  the
flash length in each channel.
6. 3
Report  the  temperature  and  pre ssure  used  for  the
tests.
NOTE: Common Errors/Problems:
• Inadequate  preheat  of  flash  mold  and/or  transfer
plunger prior to test and between shots.
• Incorrect cull thickness.
• Omission  of  transparent  or  semi-transparent  flash
in   measurement   (often   present   in   smallest   two
channels).
• Inadequate cleaning of mold between shots.
• Starting  from  the  end  of  the  ruler  to  make  flash
length measurements instead of starting at a known
distance from the end.
• Inadequate  mold  break-in.  Three  shots  should  be
run    and    disregarded    before    recording    flash
measurements for each material.
• Sprue,   channel   entry   point,   and   mating   mold
surface  wear  may  produce  error  in  measurement
and  correlation  problem.  The  impact  of  wear  on
results    has    not    been    determined.    Extent    of
permissible mold wear requires agreement between
testing organizations.</p><p>SEMI G45-93 © SEMI 1986, 19933

TEST METHOD FOR THERMAL TRANSIENT TESTING FOR DIE
ATTACHMENT EVALUATION OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS
1  Introduction</p><ol><li>1    Purpose   —   Evaluation   of   sem i conductor   die
attachment    integrity    using    the    thermal    transient
techniques   as   implemented   by   the   Electrical   Test
Method on either thermal test chips or active devices.</li><li>2   Rationale  —  Steady  state  therm al  response  (or
thermal  resistance)  and  thermal  transient  response  of
discrete  semiconductor  devices  and  integrated  circuits
are   sensitive   to   the   presence   of   voids   in   the   die
attachment  material  between  the  semiconductor  chip
and package. These voids impede the flow of heat from
the   chip   to   the   substrate   (package).   Due   to   the
difference in the thermal time constants of the chip and
package, the measurement of transient thermal response
can  be  made  more  sensitive  to  the  presence  of  voids
than   can   the   measurement   of   steady   state   thermal
response. This is because the chip thermal time constant
is  generally  several  orders  of  magnitude  shorter  than
that  of  the  package.  Thus,  the  heating  power  pulse
width can be selected so that only the chip and the chip
to  substrate  interface  are  heated  during  the  pulse  by
using  a  pulse  width  somewhat  greater  than  the  chip
thermal   time   constant,   but   less   than   that   of   the
substrate. Heating power pulse widths ranging from 10
to  400  milliseconds  have  been  found  to  satisfy  this
criterion.  This  enables  the  detection  of  voids  to  be
greatly  enhanced,  with  the  added  advantage  of  not
having  to  heat  sink  the  device  under  test.  Thus,  the
transient   thermal   response   technique   is   less   time
consuming than the measurement of thermal resistance
for  use  as  a  manufacturing  screen,  process  control  or
incoming    inspection    measure    for    die    attachment
integrity evaluation.</li><li>3    References   —   The   following   d ocuments   are

3  Test Operation
The  following  paragraphs  describe  in  conceptual  detail
the  operation  of  the  test  for  integrated  circuit  thermal
response.
3. 1  Set-Up — Shown in Figure 1 i s the set-up required
for  testing  either  active  devices  or  thermal  test  chips.
Figure 1a is used for those cases in which the TSP is the
junction    isolation    diode    forward    biased    voltage.
Thermal  test  chips  and  test  IC’s  for  which  the  junction
isolation  diode  is  either  not  available,  or  desirable  for
temperature  sensing,  can  be  handled  by  the  set-up
shown in Figure 1b.
3. 2   Apparatus  —  To  implement  ei ther  version  of
Figure 1 requires the following apparatus:
3. 2.1  A constant voltage source capa ble of adjustment
to  the  desired  value  of  V
H
and  able  to  supply  the  I
H
value drawn by the DUT.
3. 2.2   A  constant  current  source  to  su pply  I
M
with
sufficient  voltage  compliance  to  turn  the  TSP  junction
fully on.
3. 2.3    An   electronic   switch   capable   o f   switching
between the heating period conditions and measurement
conditions  in  a  time  frame  short  enough  to  avoid  DUT
cooling  during  the  transition;  this  typically  requires
switching in the microsecond range.
3. 2.4    A   voltage   measurement   circuit    capable   of
accurately  making  the  V
H
measurement  within  the  t
MD
(or  t
MD
plus  t
SW
,  depending  on  the  definitions  stated
previously) time frame with millivolt resolution.
3. 3  Operation and Waveforms —  The test begins with
the adjustment of I
M
and V
H
to the desired values. Then
with the electronic switch in position 1, the value of V
F
is measured. The switch is then moved to position 2 for
a  length  of  time  equal  to  t
H
and  the  value  of  I
H
is
measured. Finally, at the conclusion of t
H
, the switch is
again moved to position 1 and the V
F
value is measured
within  a  time  period  defined  by  t
MD
(or  t
MD
plus  t
SW
,
depending  on  the  definitions  stated  previously).  The
voltage  and  current  sources  are  then  turned  off  at  the
completion of the test.
The voltage and current waveforms for the two versions
of Figure 1 are shown in Figure 2.
4  Test Procedure
The  procedures  below  describe  how  to  set  up  the  test
conditions   and   determine   the   acceptance   limits   for
implementing    the    transient    thermal    test    for    die
attachment    evaluation    using    the    apparatus    and
definitions stated above.
4. 1  Initial Device Testing Procedu re — The following
steps  describe  in  detail  how  to  set  up  the  apparatus
described   previously   for   proper   testing   of   various
integrated circuit devices.
Step  1  —  From  a  10  to  15  piece  sample  of  the
integrated  circuits  to  be  tested,  pick  any  one  device  to
start  the  set-up  process.  Set  up  the  test  apparatus  as
follows:
V
H
=  5.0  V  (Or  some  other  desired  value  near  the
device    under    tests    (DUT’s)    normal    operating
voltage.)
t
H
= 200 ms
t
MD
= 15 us
I
M
=  1.0  mA  (Or  some  other  value  appropriate  for
the specific device under test; typically in the range
of 80 uA to 9.9 mA.)
Step  2  —  Insert  device  into  the  apparatus  test  fixture
and initiate a test.
(For best results, a test fixture that offers some form of
heat sinking would be desirable.)
Step  3  —  If  ∆V
F
is  in  the  20  to  40  mV  range,  then
proceed  to  the  next  step.    This  range  corresponds  to  a
junction  temperature  change  of  roughly  10°C  to  20°C
and is sufficient for initial comparison purposes.
If ∆V
F
is less than 20 mV, return to Step 1 and increase
heating  power  into  device  by  increasing  V
H
,  or  by
reconfiguring  the  DUT  connections  for  greater  power
dissipation, or a combination of both.
If ∆V
F
is greater than 80 mV, corresponding to a junc-
tion  temperature  change  greater  than  40°C,  it  would
probably  be  desirable  to  reduce  the  heating  power  by
returning    to    Step    1    and    reducing    V
H
,    or    by
reconfiguring  the  DUT  connections  to  reduce  power
dissipation, or a combination of the two.  Reducing V
H
is the preferable approach.
Because  two  different  devices  can  show  the  same  rise
in  junction  temperature,  even  if  the  value  of  P
H
is
different,    a    comparison    of    the    devices    is    best
accomplished   using   the   CU   value.   As   defined   in
Section  2  above,  CU  provides  a  comparison  unit  that
takes into account different device I
H
values for a given
V
H
test condition.</p><p>SEMI G46-88 © SEMI 19883
Step  4  —  Test  each  of  the  sample  devices  and  record
the ∆V
F
and CU data as shown in Figure 3.
Step  5  —  Select  out  the  devices  with  the  highest  and
lowest  values  of  CU  and  put  the  remaining  devices
aside.
The ∆V
F
values can be used instead of CU if the mea-
sured  values  of  I
H
are  very  tightly  grouped  aroung  the
average value.
Step  6  —  Following  the  Heating  Time  (t
H
)  sequence
shown  in  Figure  4,  read  and  record  the  ∆V
F
and  CU
data values for each of the two devices of Step 5.
Step  7  —  Using  the  data  from  the  previous  step,
prepare heating curves for the two devices in a manner
similar to the examples shown in Figure 5.
Step 8 — Interpretation of the heating curves is the next
step.   Realizing   that   the   thermal   characteristics   of
identical  chips  should  be  the  same  if  the  heating  time
(t
H
) is less than or equal to the thermal time constant of
the  chip,  the  two  curves  should  start  out  the  same  for
the low values of t
H
. Non-identical chips (i.e., thinner or
smaller in cross section) will have completely different
curves, even at the smaller values of t
H
. As the value of
t
H
is  increased,  thereby  overcoming  the  chip  thermal
constant,  heat  will  have  propagated  through  the  chip
into  the  die  attachment  region.  Since  the  heating  curve
devices  of  Step  5  were  specifically  chosen  for  their
difference,  the  curves  of  Figure  5  diverge  after  t
H
reaches  a  value  where  the  die  attachment  variance  has
an effect on the device junction temperature. Increasing
t
H
further  will  probably  result  in  a  flattening  of  the
curve  as  the  heating  propagates  in  the  device  package.
If  the  device  package  has  little  thermal  mass  and/or  is
not well mounted to a good heat sink, the curve will not
flatten  very  much,  but  will  show  a  definite  change  in
slope.  Figure  6  shows  the  key  elements  of  the  heating
curve.
Step   9   —   Using   the   heating   curve,   select   the
appropriate  value  of  t
H
to  correspond  to  the  inflection
point  in  the  transition  region  between  heat  in  the  chip
and heat in the package.
If  there  are  several  different  elements  in  the  heat  flow
path-chip,     die     attachment,     substrate,     substrate
attachment, and package, for example, in a hybrid there
will  be  several  plateaus  and  transitions  in  the  heating
curve.   Appropriate   selection   of   t
H
will   optimize
evaluation sensitivity to other attachment areas.
Step  10  —  Return  to  the  apparatus  and  set  t
H
equal  to
the value determined from Step 9.
Step 11 — Because the selected value of t
H
is much less
than  that  for  thermal  equilibrium,  it  is  possible  to
significantly    increase    the    heating    power    without
degrading   or   destroying   the   device.   The   increased
power  dissipation  within  the  device  under  test  will
result  in  high  ∆V
F
and/or  CU  values  that  will  make
determination of acceptable and non-acceptable devices
much easier.
Step 12 — The pass/fail limit, the cutoff point between
acceptable    and    non-acceptable    devices,    can    be
established in a variety of ways:
a)   Correlation   to   other   die   attachment   evaluation
methods,  such  as  die  shear  and/or  x-ray;  while  these
two  methods  have  little  actual  value  from  a  thermal
point  of  view,  they  do  represent  standardized  methods
as described in MIL-STD specifications.
b)  Maximum  allowable  junction  temperature  variation
between  devices;  since  the  relationship  between  ∆T
J
and ∆V
F
is  about  0.5°C/mV,  the  junction  temperature
spread  between  devicescan  be  easily  determined.  The
T
J
predicts reliability. Conversely, the T
J
spread  neces-
sary to meet the reliability projections can be translated
to a ∆V
F
and/or CU value for a Pass/Fail criteria, based
on  correlation  with  steady-state  thermal  equilibrium
conditions.
To  fully  use  this  approach,  it  will  be  necessary  to
calibrate  the  devices  for  the  exact  value  of  the  T
J</p><ul><li>V
F
characteristic.   The   characteristic’s   slope,   commonly
referred to as K Factor, is easily measured on a sample
basis    using    a    voltmeter,    environmental    chamber,
temperature  indicator  and  a  power  supply  setup  for
forcing,  both  active  devices  and  thermal  test  chips  as
shown in Figure 7. A simple set of equations yields the
junction temperature once K and ∆V
F
are known:
∆T
j
= | (K) (∆V
F
) |
T
J
= T
A</li></ul><ul><li>∆T
j
Where T
A
is the ambient or reference temperature.
c) Statistically from a moderate size device sample; the
distribution  of  ∆V
F
or  CU  values  should  be  a  normal
one  with  defective  devices  out  of  the  normal  range.
Figure  8  shows  a  ∆V
F
distribution  for  a  sample  lot  of
integrated  ciruits.  Note  that  the  left-hand  side  of  the
histogram envelope is fairly well-defined, but the other
side  is  greatly  skewed  to  the  right.  This  comes  about
because   the   left-hand   side   is   constrained   by   the
absolutely  best  heat  flow  that  can  be  obtained  with  a
given  chip  assembly  material  and  process.  The  other
side has no such constraints because there is no limit as
to how poorly a chip is mounted.</li></ul><p>SEMI G46-88 © SEMI 19884
The  usual  rule  of  thumb  in  setting  the  maximum  limit
for ∆V
F
or  CU  is  to  use  the  distribution  average  value
and one standard deviation ( σ) i.e. —
(∆V
F
)
high
limit
=∆V
F
+Xσ
∆
(CU)
high
limit
=CU+Xσ
CU
Where X = 1 in most cases.
The statistical data required is obtained by testing 40 or
more devices under the conditions of Step 11.
Step  13  —  Once  the  test  conditions  and  pass/fail  limit
have been determined, it is necessary only to record this
information for future testing requirements of the same
device   in   the   same   package.   With   the   apparatus
properly  set-up,  including  the  fail  limit  selector  on
those  apparatus  set  ups  so  equipped,  the  operator  need
only  insert  the  device,  initiate  a  test,  and  then  either
read the ∆V
F
or  CU  display  or  observe  the  appropriate
pass or fail indicaors.
The    steps    listed    hereto    have    been    conveniently
summarized  in  Figure  9.  The  total  time  required  to
perform these steps is greatly dependent on the operator
but,  in  general,  should  require  about  one  hour  if  the
statistical approach of Step 12.C is used.
4. 2
Routine  Device  Testing  Proced ure  —  Once  the
proper  control  settings  have  been  determined  for  a
particular   device   type   from   a   given   manufacturing
process  or  vendor,  repeated  testing  of  that  device  type
simply requires that the same test conditions be used as
previously determined.
New  device  types  or  the  same  devices  manufactured
with a different process will require a repeat of Section
4. 1.
4. 3
Comparison  of  Different  Vend or  Devices  —  Each
device  type  is  defined  as  a  specific  chip  manufactured
to  a  given  set  of  procedures.  Integrated  circuit  users
who  buy  a  specific  part  number  from  more  than  one
vendor  or  manufacturers  that  redesign  or  otherwise
modify  the  fabrication  of  their  devices  will  be  able  to
use  the  heating  power  and  approximately  the  same  t
H
for all vendors, but probably will have to use a different
∆V
F

SPECIFICATION FOR MEASUREMENT METHOD FOR MOLDED
PLASTIC PACKAGE TOOLING
1  Preface
This    document    is    prepared    to    enable    standard
measurement  techniques  to  be  used.  It  is  intended  that
the     measurement     techniques     described     in     the
specification  will  apply  to  all  molded  plastic  package
tooling, i.e. DIPS, SIPS, PCC, SO, Quad, and TAB.
2  Applicable Documents
2. 1  SEMI Specifications
SEMI G14 — Plastic Molded DIP Tooling
SEMI G16 — Plastic Chip Carrier Tooling
SEMI G36 — Plastic Molded High Density TAB Quad
Tooling
SEMI G37 — Plastic Molded SO Package Tooling
3 Basic Equipment
3. 1      The   following   basic   equipment   is   required   to
perform the specified measurements:
3. 1.1  Toolmaker’s  Microscope  —  3×  objective  and
10×  eyepiece  total  30×  with  X  and  Y  axes  digital
readouts  reading  to  0.0001&quot;.  Minimum  travel  of  stage
must  be  2.0&quot;  ×  2.0&quot;.  Eyepiece  must  be  ±  0.0002&quot;
minimum.  The  toolmaker’s  microscope  should  have  a
goniometer  on  the  eyepiece  as  will  as  on  the  stage.
Accuracy  of  the  goniometer  shall  be  0.1.  The  TM
microscope   should   have   a   Z   axis   with   a   digital
measurement   capability,   reading   in   increments   of
0. 0001&quot;.  The  objective  lens  must  be  20×  minimum
which   will   give   0.0005&quot;   accuracy   to   the   Z   axis
measurements.
3. 1.2  Optical Comparator — Surface illumination. 10&quot;
minimum   screen   with   3&quot;   ×   8&quot;   minimum   travel.
Magnification    of    10×,    20×    minimum    required.
Accuracy of 10× is 0.001&quot;; accuracy of 20× is 0.0005&quot;.
Some   operators   may   be   able   to   improve   on   this
accuracy,  but  this  is  the  best  expected  from  average
inspectors.
3. 1.2.1    Overlays  at  20×  may  be  used  for  rapid  mea-
surement. The user is cautioned that the thickness of the
line  must  be  controlled.  Line  widths  must  not  exceed
0. 010&quot;  in  width,  which  will  give  an  inaccuracy  of
0. 0005&quot;  in  the  measurement.  Overlays  must  have  the
datum  marks  clearly  labeled.  Overlays  are  tools  which
speed  inspection;  however,  rejects  must  be  verified  by
toolmaker’s microscope measurements, which are more
accurate.
3. 1.3  Digital  Depth  Indicator  —  Mounted  on  a  stand.
Digital reading with a range of 2&quot; is available. Readout
must  display  increments  of  0.0001&quot;  with  ±  1  digit
accuracy.
3. 1.4  Micrometer  —  0  to  1.0&quot;.  0.250&quot;  diameter  for
measuring to 0.001&quot; accuracy.
3. 1.5    Eight  (8)  inch  dial  calipers  for  measuring  to
0. 002&quot; accuracy.
3. 1.6   Granite  Surface  Plate  —  Minimum  size  18&quot;  ×
28&quot;, with a surface accuracy of 0.0002&quot; or better.
3. 1.7  Surface Finish
3. 1.7.1   Charmille  Visual  Surface  Finish  Standard  —
(For   comparison   of   Electric   Discharge   Machined
(EDM) surface only.)
3. 1.7.2  Surface  Comparator  Standards  —  (For  other
machined surfaces.)
3. 1.7.3  Surface Analyzer
3. 1.8   Binocular,  Zoom  Microscope  —  10—15×  mag-
nification with vertical or near vertical lighting.
3. 1.9  Dial  Indicators  —  With  accuracy  of  .0001  and
with force not to exceed 5 grams.
3. 2  Alternative  Equipment  —  Sophisticated,  automatic
equipment  is  not  excluded  from  use,  but  the  user  must
ensure   that   such   equipment   meets   or   exceeds   the
accuracy  of  the  basic  equipment  so  that  correlation
problems may be avoided.
3. 3  Calibration — All equipment to be calibrated on a
regular schedule.

and  the  Y  axis  lies  perpendicular  to  the  rails  of  the
frame.
4. 2.3.2    The  package  X  and  Y  axes  must  be  positioned
parallel  to  the  X  and  Y  axes  of  the  measurement  stage
travel to avoid measurement errors.
4. 2.3.3  The datum of the X and Y axes is the pilot hole
of the leadframe, because it is the most accurate feature.
An additional pilot hole is required to establish the theta
datum.
4. 2.3.4  The Z axis is perpendicular to the X and Y axis.
The datum is the leadframe or the top mold parting line,
unless otherwise specified.
5  Measurement
5. 1  Package Thickness — (Figure 1)
5. 1.1  Equipment — Micrometer
5. 1.2    Using  the  micrometer,  measure  the  thickness  of
the  package  at  three  (3)  places,  diagonally  across  the
package,  where  the  contours  allow,  at  the  top  edge,
middle and bottom edge of the package. (Note: the top
is the pin 1 identifier edge.)
5. 2  Package Length — (Figure 1)
5. 2.1  Equipment — Optical Comparator at 10×.
5. 2.2  Position  the  package  so  that  the  cross-sectional
view  is  presented  for  measurement.  Use  care  to  assure
the package is square to the datum plane.
5. 2.3    Align  the  package  side  draft  angle  (see  Section
5. 21)  where  the  draft  angle  intersects  the  leadframe.
This  is  the  parting  line  (datum  point).  Measure  the
overall   width   at   the   parting   line,   including   cavity
mismatch.
5. 3  Package Width — (Figure 1)
5. 3.1  Equipment — Optical Comparator at 10×.
5. 3.2  Position  the  package  so  that  the  cross-sectional
view  is  presented  for  measurement.  Use  care  to  assure
the package is square to the datum plane.
5. 3.3    Align  the  package  side  draft  angle  (see  Section
5. 21)  where  the  draft  angle  intersects  the  leadframe.
This  is  the  parting  line  (datum  point).  Measure  the
overall   width   at   the   parting   line   including   cavity
mismatch.
5. 4  Leadframe to Cavity Offset — (Figure 2)
5. 4.1  Equipment — Toolmaker’s Microscope at 30×.
5. 4.2      Position   the   circle   (cross   hair)   of   the   filar
eyepiece of similar diameter to the leadframe pilot hole.
Zero  the  digital  readout.  Move  the  stage  to  the  point
where  the  molded  package  meets  the  leadframe  at  the
parting  line.  Record  digital  readout  reading  as  (T1).
Continue  to  move  the  stage  until  the  point  on  the
opposite  side  where  mold  compound  and  leadframe
meet. Record digital readout reading as T2. Continue to
move  stage  to  center  of  leadframe  rail  (usually  also  a
hole). Record the digital readout reading as T3.
5. 4.3    Turn  part  over  and  BE  SURE  TO  USE  THE
SAME   HOLE   AND   PART;   repeat   the   three   (3)
readings, B1, B2, and B3.
5. 4.4  Derive the data from the readings as follows:
Top Centerline of Frame = (T3)/2
Bottom Centerline of Frame = (B3)/2
Measurement Error = (T3)/2 - (B3)/2
Frame Cavity Offset = (B3)/2 - (B2 + B1)/2</p><p>SEMI G48-89 © SEMI 1989, 1996 3
Centerline  of  Package  =  (T2  +  T1)/2;  (B2  +  B1)/2.
(Relative to datum)
NOTE:   Figure   2   calculations   assume   that   the   leadframe
centerline is equidistant between T3 and the zero datum point.
5. 4.5  In lieu of the frame pilot hole, the dambar may be
used on the frame when measuring the offset; however,
the    possibility    of    tolerance    error    may    become
cumulative,    particularly    with    etched    rather    than
stamped frames.
NOTE:   By   SEMI   convention   the   offsets   are   defined   in
relation to the bottom cavity of the mold.
5. 5  Top Cavity Length “Y” Axis — (Figure 2)
5. 5.1  Equipment — Toolmaker’s Microscope at 30×.
5. 5.2    Focus  the  microscope  on  the  leadframe  datum
point.  Zero  the  digital  readout.  Move  the  stage  to  the
intersection  of  the  mold  compound  and  the  leadframe
parting  line.  Read  and  record.  Continue  to  measure
across  the  package  length  to  the  intersection  of  the
mold  compound  and  the  leadframe  parting  line  on  the
opposite edge of the package. Read and record.
5. 5.3  The cavity length is defined as (Ty2 – Ty1).
5. 6  Top Cavity Width “X” Axis — (Figure 2)
5. 6.1  Equipment — Toolmaker’s Microscope at 30×.
5. 6.2    Focus  the  microscope  on  the  leadframe  datum
point.  Zero  the  digital  readout.  Move  the  stage  to  the
intersection  of  the  mold  compound  and  the  leadframe
parting  line.  Read  and  record  the  reading.  Continue  on
to  the  intersection  of  the  mold  compound  and  the
leadframe  parting  line  on  the  opposite  side.  Read  and
record.
5. 6.3  The cavity width is defined as Tx2 – Tx1.
5. 7  Bottom Cavity Length “X” Axis — (Figure 2)
5. 7.1  Equipment — Toolmaker’s Microscope at 30×.
5. 7.2    Focus  the  microscope  on  the  same  datum  point
used  for  the  top  cavity  length  (remember  the  package
has been turned over). Zero the digital readout. Move to
the   intersection   of   the   mold   compound   and   the
leadframe  parting  line.  Read  and  record  the  reading.
Continue to the intersection of the mold compound and
the  leadframe  parting  line  on  the  opposite  side.  Read
and  record.  The  bottom  cavity  length  is  the  difference
of  the  two  readings.  Record  the  bottom  cavity  length
(By2 – By1).
5. 8  Bottom Cavity Width “X” Axis — (Figure 2)
5. 8.1  Equipment — Toolmaker’s Microscope at 30×.
5. 8.2    Focus  the  microscope  on  the  leadframe  datum
point.  Zero  the  digital  readout.  Move  the  stage  to  the
intersection  of  the  mold  compound  and  the  leadframe
parting line. Read and record. The bottom cavity width
is the difference of the two readings (Bx2 – Bx1).
5. 9  Cavity Overlap/Underlap — (Figure 4)
5. 9.1    Compare  the  top  cavity  length  to  the  bottom
cavity  length  and  the  top  cavity  width  to  the  bottom
cavity  width.  The  difference  in  the  number  is  the
overlap/underlap for each axis.
5. 10  Cavity to Cavity Mismatch — (Figure 2)
5. 10.1    The  comparison  of  the  centerlines  of  the  top
cavity  length  to  the  bottom  cavity  length  and  the  top
cavity width to the bottom cavity width shall determine
the cavity to cavity mismatch.
Formula:
Cavity to Cavity Mismatch =
(B2 + B1)/2 – (T2 + T1)/2
5. 11  Cavity Depth — (Figure 1)
5. 11.1  Equipment — Depth Indicator
5. 11.2  Top Cavity Depth — Measure the distance from
the  top  surface  of  the  leadframe  to  the  top  of  the  unit,
place  the  indicator  on  the  surface  of  the  leadframe,
zeroing  the  readout,  moving  the  part  to  a  point  where
the top of the unit can be indicated, and read and record
the readout.
5. 11.3   Bottom  Cavity  Depth  —  The  measurement  is
performed  in  the  same  manner  as  the  measurement  in
Section  5.11.2  except  the  part  is  turned  over  and  the
bottom  surface  of  the  leadframe  to  the  bottom  of  the
unit is used.
5. 11.4    The  package  depth  is  the  sum  of  the  frame
thickness   and   the   top   and   bottom   depth.   (This
measurement  should  equal  Section  5.1.  Any  variation
may be considered measurement error.)
5. 12  Molding   Protrusions   Top/Bottom   of   Part   —
(Figure 3)
5. 12.1  Equipment — Digital depth indicator.
5. 12.2  Place unit on the anvil and zero the indicator on
the  package  surface  away  from  area  of  protrusion.
Carefully  move  the  part  to  where  the  protrusion  is
located.  Carefully  lower  the  indicator  to  the  top  of  the
mold protrusion. Read and record the mold protrusion.
5. 13  Pin Depths — (Figure 3)
5. 13.1  Equipment  —  Depth  indicator  with  a  fine  point
or “Z” axis reading toolmaker’s microscope.
5. 13.2    The  measurement  is  made  from  the  nominal
plane of the package surface to the bottom of the design</p><p>SEMI G48-89 © SEMI 1989, 1996 4
mark  (either  ejector  pin  or  Pin  #1  indicator  or  other
feature).
5. 13.3  The  indicator  is set  to  zero  on  the  package
surface  and  then  moved  to  the  bottom  of  the  feature.
The readout is read and recorded.
5. 14  Dambar Trimming Defects — (Figure 4)
5. 14.1  Equipment — Toolmaker’s Microscope
5. 14.2  Measure from the edge of the lead to the edge of
the  protrusion  or  intrusion;  record  the  reading  and  the
lead number.
NOTE:  Dambar  trimming  defects  are  those  which  can  be
caused  by  overcutting  into  the  lead  shoulder  (stand  off)  i.e.
cutting  too  much  or  undercutting  the  dambar,  leaving  too
much   dambar   or   a   burr.   Overcutting   causes   shoulder
intrusions. Undercutting leaves shoulder protrusions. In some
cases,  an  adjacent  protrusion  and  intrusion  is  caused  by
misalignment of the part at the time of dambar removal.
5. 15  Package Warpage — (Figure 5)
5. 15.1  Equipment  —  Microscope  “Z”  Axis  reading
40×.
5. 15.2    With  the  package  sitting  on  the  stage,  obtain  a
two  point  datum  by  measuring  two-points  on  opposite
edges  0.005  from  the  radius  readings;  move  to  the
center of the package and obtain the deviation from the
datum, and read and record the reading as the warp.
5. 15.3    For  quad  packages,  it  is  equally  important  that
there be minimum warp in each axis (X or Y) so that a
three-point  Z  axis  datum  must  be  obtained;  the  two
used  in  5.15.2  and  an  additional  one,  on  one  adjacent
edge.
5. 16  Lead Coplanarity
NOTE: Applies to all surface mount devices.
5. 16.1  Contact Method — (Figure 6)
NOTE: Not recommended for gull-wing leads.
5. 16.1.1  Equipment
Dial      Indicator      0.0001&quot;      Accuracy, 5 grams maximum
pressure.
Granite      Flat.
Transfer      Stand.
Package      Holding      Fixture.
Reference Gauge Blocks, 0.0002&quot; Accuracy.
5. 16.1.2  Place  the  package  on  holding  fixture  so  that
the  flat  sections  of  the  leads,  as  they  exit  from  the
plastic, are on the ground flats of the fixture. The leads
are to be facing “UP” (Dead Bug).
5. 16.1.3  On the granite flat, set up the dial indicator on
its   transfer   stand   and   zero   the   reading   using   the
reference  block.  Use  a  suitable  reference  block  so  that
all measurements are positive to avoid confusion.
5. 16.1.4    Measure  the  highest  point  on  each  lead  (e.g.,
the tangent point of a “J” lead).
5. 16.1.5  Determine the range of readings.
NOTE: Special Precautions</p><ol><li>Be  sure  that  the  flat  of  the  leadframe,  as  it  exits
from  the  plastic,  rests  on  the  flats  of  the  holding
fixture. If the radiused section supports the package,
then spurious readings will result.</li><li>The  pressure  exerted  by  the  dial  indicator  must  not
exceed  5  grams.  To  check  the  contact  pressure  of
the  dial  indicator,  use  a  gram  gauge.  The  gram
pressure must be noted at the initial deflection of the
gauge and at the maximum deflection of the gauge.
If the initial deflection is greater than 5 grams, then
the  point  where  5  grams  is  obtained  must  be  noted
and the measurement must stay within this range to
be valid.</li><li>16.2  Comparator/Mirror Method</li><li>16.2.1  Equipment — Optical comparator with at least
20×  magnification  as  per  Section  3.1.2.  Mirror,  flat
within  0.0005  inch  with  a  mirror  finish  having  the
reflective  suface  on  top.  (A  polished  silver  wafer  is
suggested.)</li><li>16.2.2    Place  the  mirror  on  the  measurement  stage
mirrored side up with the mirror in the plane of the XY
axis.  Place  the  package  on  the  mirror  with  the  leads
down.  Sufficient  mirror  must  extend  past  the  leads
toward  the  lens  of  the  comparator  so  that  an  image  of
the leads with its reflection can be viewed. Focus on the
leads nearest the lens. (Care must be taken not to focus
on  the  leads  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  package.)  (See
Figure 8.)</li><li>16.2.3  Measure the distance between the lead tip and
its reflection. Divide that measurement by two to obtain
the coplanarity of the lead.</li><li>16.2.4    Repeat  for  each  lead.  Rotate  part  to  measure
all    sides.    Determine    co-planarity    by    identifying
maximum measurement.</li><li>17  Shoulder Bend Location — (Figures 1, 7, and 7a)
NOTE: This measurement is not precise, since radius tangent
locations allow for considerable inspector interpretation.</li><li>17.1  Equipment  —  Comparator  at  20×  magnifica-
tion. (Surface and shadow illumination).</li></ol><p>SEMI G48-89 © SEMI 1989, 1996 5
5. 17.2  The measurement is made from the intersection
of  the  straight  part  of  the  shoulder  with  the  shoulder
bend radius of the lead on one side of the package to the
same  point  on  the  lead  on  the  opposite  side  of  the
package. Locate this point on the first lead by lining up
the  vertical  comparator  cross  hair  with  the  straight  of
the lead. Bring the center point of the cross hair to this
intersection.  Zero  the  readout,  move  to  the  opposite
lead, and repeat the location of the intersection. Record
the measurement.
NOTE: Due to shadowing of leads, only the end leads on the
package  can  be  measured.  A  visual  check  with  a  10  to  20×
microscope  should  be  made  to  check  for  gross  difference  of
other leads.

5. 19  Radii
5. 19.1  Comparative Method
5. 19.1.1  Equipment — Optical comparator at 20×.
5. 19.1.2    Radii  are  measured  by  comparison  to  known
radius overlays marked at the same magnification as the
comparator.
5. 19.2  Absolute Method
5. 19.2.1  Equipment — Toolmaker’s Microscope.
5. 19.2.2    Radii  are  measured  using  the  reticle  lines  and
the X and Y axes to obtain the radius.
5. 19.2.3    Care  must  be  taken  to  assure  that  each  radius
is measured separately.
5. 20  Lead Position
NOTE: Lead position is a combination of pitch variations due
to lead movement after forming and lead width. If the lead is
to   fit   a   solder   pad   or   hole,   the   combination   must   be
considered.  In  some  cases,  the  lead  width  can  be  a  major
contributor  to  poor  lead  position,  eg.  SO  packages  with  gull-
wing leads, PCC with J bend.
5. 20.1  Comparative Method
NOTE: This method will only determine if the part is usable,
not the breakdown of width and pitch variations.
5. 20.1.1  Equipment — Optical Comparator at 20×.
5. 20.1.2    Align  the  package  to  an  overlay  displaying
limit lines for lead pitch/width.
5. 20.2  Absolute Method
5. 20.2.1  Equipment — Toolmaker’s Microscope.
5. 20.2.2  Move to the edge of the lead number and zero
the readout.
NOTE:  Where  there  is  a  definitive  end  to  the  lead  as  in  the
case of SO, SIP and DP, the end of the lead at the intersection
of  the  lead  in  feature,  will  be  the  measurement  point.  Quad
PCC  packages  will  be  measured  at  the  top  of  the  “J”  bend
when in the “Dead Bug” position.
5. 20.2.3    Move  to  the  opposite  edge  of  that  lead  and
record width.
5. 20.2.4  Move to the first edge of the next lead. Record
the measurement. Repeat the width measurements.
5. 20.2.5  Repeat for all leads to be measured.
5. 20.2.6            Pitch      can      be      calculated      from      the
measurements.
5. 21  Draft Angles
5. 21.1  Package Sides
5. 21.1.1  Equipment — Optical comparator at 10x.
5. 21.1.2    Lay  the  top  or  bottom  surface  of  the  package
squarely   onto   the   comparator   to   insure   that   no
protrusions  on  the  surface  cause  the  package  to  be
tilted.  Align  the  horizontal  cross-hair  to  the  leadframe.
Using  the  vertical  cross  hair,  compare  the  draft  angles
to an overlay.
NOTE:  This  measurement  should  be  taken  before  the  leads
are formed.
5. 21.1.3      Repeat   the   procedure   for   all   sides   of   the
package.</p><p>SEMI G48-89 © SEMI 1989, 1996 6
5. 21.2      Pin   Marks   (e.g.,   Pin   1   indicator   at   end   of
package).
5. 21.2.1  Equipment — Toolmaker’s Microscope.
5. 21.2.2    Focus  the  microscope  on  the  surface  of  the
package and measure the diameter of the pin hole. (D1)
5. 21.2.3    Focus  on  the  bottom  surface  of  the  pin  hole
and measure the diameter. (D2)
5. 21.2.4  Tangent of Draft angle = (D1 – D2)/2H where
H is pin depth from Section 5.12 or cavity thickness.
5. 21.2.5    In  some  cases  ejector  pin  holes  may  require
measurement if a deep hole is specified.
5. 22  Lead Spread — (Figures 1, 7, and 7a)
5. 22.1  MDIP, SO — (Figure 7, 7a)
5. 22.1.1  Equipment   —   Optical   Comparator   at   10×
Magnification.
5. 22.1.2  Place the package squarely on the comparator
with  the  leads  “UP”  and  find  the  mid-point  of  the
bottom cavity width.
5. 22.1.3  Measure the distance to the outer edge of each
row of leads at the widest point of spread.
5. 22.2      PCC   (J   bend   lead   dimension)   (Foot   Print)
Measure from perpendicular to the greatest extension of
the “J” radius of the leads on one side of the package to
the  perpendicular  tangent  to  the  greatest  extension  of
the “J” radius of the leads on the opposite package side.
(See Figure 1.)
5. 23  Foot Angle — (Figure 7)
NOTE: Applies to gull-wing leads.
5. 23.1  Equipment   —   Optical   Comparator   at   20×
Magnification.  Device  Holding  Fixture  (see  Section
5. 16).
5. 23.2    Place  the  device  in  the  fixture,  so  that  the  flat
section of the leadframe at the junction with the plastic
body  rests  on  the  fixture’s  flats.  Leads  to  be  facing
“UP”.
NOTE:  Do  not  rest  the  radiused  sections  of  the  leads  on  the
flats.  Be  sure  that  all  mold  flash  is  removed  from  the  area  of
the frame that rests on the flats.
5. 23.3  Measure the angle of the foot with respect to the
horizontal.
5. 24  Foot Length — (Figure 7)
NOTE: Applies to gull-wing leads.
5. 24.1  Equipment   —   Optical   Comparator   at   20×
Magnification.  Device  Holding  Fixture  (see  Section
5. 23).
5. 24.2  While the foot angle is being measured, place a
circle  template  that  contains  the  same  radius  as  the
formed part onto the comparator. Align this template to
the  radius  of  the  outside  bend.  Where  the  radius  of  the
template meets the radius of the outside bend, this is the
tangent point to measure foot length.
5. 25  Stand-Off
5. 25.1  Measure  the  plastic stand-off,  when  applicable,
using the procedures of Section 5.12.
5. 26 Lead Sweep
5. 26.1  Equipment   —   Toolmaker’s   Microscope   or
Optical Comparator.
5. 26.2  Method
5. 26.2.1  Determine  centerline of  lead  at  egress  of  lead
from molded body (CL1) (see Figure 4).
5. 26.2.2    Determine  centerline  at  the  end  of  the  lead
(CL2).   The   difference   between   the   two   centerlines
CL2 – CL1, shall be the lead sweep.
NOTE: On “J” lead devices, the end of the lead is defined as
the bottom of the “J” lead radius.
5. 26.3  Cautionary Notes
5. 26.3.1  Verify    centerlines    on    leadframe    before
measuring to ensure lead-frame is correct.
5. 26.3.2    Verify  lead  position  in  relation  to  the  top
cavity centerline.</p><p>SEMI G48-89 © SEMI 1989, 1996 7</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>Figure 2</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-tags-row row margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/tags/semi">SEMI</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/tags/standard">Standard</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/your-org/semiconductor-docs/tree/main/docs/standards/semi/semi-chapter-125.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>编辑此页</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="文件选项卡"></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">文档</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/ic-design/intro">芯片设计</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/process/intro">工艺制造</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/eda-tools/intro">EDA工具</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/standards/intro">协议标准</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">社区</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/your-org/semiconductor-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/blog">技术博客</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">更多</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/blog">更新日志</a></li><li class="footer__item">
