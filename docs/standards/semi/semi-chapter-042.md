SEMI E54.10-0600 © SEMI 20001 SEMI E54.10-0600SPECIFICATION FOR SENSOR/ACTUATOR NETWORK SPECIFICDEVICE MODEL FOR AN IN-SITU PARTICLE MONITOR DEVICE This specification was technically approved by the Global Information & Control Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Information & Control Committee. Current edition approved by theNorth American Regional Standards Committee on March 2, 2000. Initially available at www.semi.org May2000; to be published June 2000. 1 Purpose1.1 This specification is part of a s uite of standardsthat specify the implementation of SEMI standards forthe Sensor/Actuator Network. The specific purpose ofthis specification is to describe a network independentapplication model comprised of device objects that arecommon to all In-Situ Particle Monitor Devices on asemiconductor equipment Sensor/Actuator communica-tions network. 2 Scope2.1 An In-Situ Particle Monitor (IS PM) is a devicethat measures and counts particles. These devices clas-sify by size and count, particles in the environment(gaseous, liquid, or vacuum) utilizing a technique suchas detecting light from a sample region of the environ-ments space. These counts are accumulated in bins andthen reported. The number of bins varies by vendor andmodel.2.2 This specification specifically addresses theminimum attributes, services, and behavior an In-SituParticle Monitor (ISPM) device must support to beinteroperable on the Sensor/Actuator Network.2.3 This specification is intended t o ensure a high-degree of device interoperability on the Sensor/ActuatorNetwork, while still allowing flexibility for productdifferentiation and technology evolution.2.4 The model specified in this spe cification is used inconjunction with SEMI E54.1 (Standard for Sensor/Actuator Network Common Device Model (CDM)) tocompletely describe the ISPM as it appears from thenetwork interface.2.5 This specification, together wi th SEMI E54, SEMIE54.1, and one of the Sensor/Actuator NetworkCommunication Specifications, form a completeinteroperability specification for the ISPM.2.6 To comply with this specificat ion, a device mustimplement and support, at a minimum, the requiredattributes, services, and behavior identified in thesedocuments. Support for optional attributes, services,and behavior is not required to be compliant to thisspecification. Optional attributes, services, and behaviorare specified in these documents to promote further device interoperability as features evolve and areadopted by more manufacturers. If optional attributes,services, and behavior are implemented for this devicethey must be implemented as identified in thisdocument.2.7 This specification does not pur port to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this specification to estab-lish appropriate safety and health practices and deter-mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior touse. 3 Limitations3.1 This specification is a compan ion to a suite of spe-cifications that together make up the Sensor/ActuatorNetwork Communication standard. Therefore, usingportions of this specification that relate to networkcommunications necessarily requires an understandingof the associated network specification.3.2 As this document is a specifica tion for the In-SituParticle Monitor Device Model, it does not contain anydefinition of objects, attributes, services, or behavioraldescriptions that are already defined in SEMI E54.1.Additional attributes, attribute assignments, services,and/or service parameters that are ISPM Device speci-fic and/or implementation specific are contained in thisspecification.3.3 While this specification is suff icient to completelydescribe the ISPM as it appears from the network, itdoes not fully describe behavior of the ISPM which isnot visible from the network. This allows flexibility inimplementation techniques and product differentiationbetween manufacturers. Manufacturer specific objectsmay be defined by the manufacturer but are, bydefinition, outside the scope of this standard.3.4 This specification is compatibl e, but not compliantwith SEMI E39. This means that although thisspecification does not require compliance with SEMIE39, it is extensible such that implementations may bedeveloped that are fully compliant with both standards.Note that the concepts and terminology of thisspecification are compatible with those of SEMI E39.However, SEMI E39 has specific requirements that are

SEMI E54.11-0301 © SEMI 20011 SEMI E54.11-0301SPECIFIC DEVICE MODEL FOR ENDPOINT DEVICES This specific device model was technically approved by the Global Information & Control Committee and isthe direct responsibility of the North American Information & Control Committee. Current edition approvedby the North American Regional Standards Committee on November 22, 2000. Initially available atwww.semi.org January 2001; to be published March 2001. 1 Purpose1.1 This specification is part of a s uite of standardsthat specify the implementation of SEMI standards forthe Sensor/Actuator Network. The specific purpose ofthis specification is to describe a network independentapplication model comprised of device objects that arecommon to all Endpoint Devices on a semiconductorequipment Sensor/Actuator communication network. 2 Scope2.1 An Endpoint device (EPD) is a device thatmeasures and monitors process characteristics todetermine when a specific threshold or event has beenobtained usually to signal the completion of a processor process step. These endpoint devices are, but notlimited to, devices that may classify a process endpointby determining the size and count of particles in theprocess environment, detecting and determining opticallight from a sample region of the environments space,or determining motor current of an equipmentcomponent.2.2 This specification specifically addresses theminimum attributes, services and behavior an Endpoint(EPD) device must support to be interoperable on theSensor/Actuator Network.2.3 This specification is intended t o ensure a high-degree of device interoperability on the Sensor/ActuatorNetwork, while still allowing flexibility for productdifferentiation and technology evolution.2.4 The model specified in this spe cification is used inconjunction with the Sensor/Actuator NetworkCommon Device Model (CDM) to completely describethe Endpoint device (EPD) as it appears from thenetwork interface.2.5 This specification, together wi th theSensor/Actuator Network Standard, theSensor/Actuator Network Common Device Model, anda Sensor/Actuator Network CommunicationSpecification, form a complete interoperabilityspecification for the EPD.2.6 To comply with this specificat ion, a device mustimplement and support, at a minimum, the requiredattributes, services, and behavior identified in thesedocuments. Support for optional attributes, services and behavior is not required to be compliant to thisspecification. Optional attributes, services, and behaviorare specified in these documents to promote furtherdevice interoperability as features evolve and areadopted by more manufacturers. If optional attributes,services, and behavior are implemented for this devicethey must be implemented as identified in thisdocument.2.7 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use 3 Limitations3.1 This specification is a compan ion to a suite ofspecifications that together make up theSensor/Actuator Network Communication standard.Therefore, using portions of this specification that relateto network communications necessarily requires anunderstanding of the associated network specification.3.2 As this document is a specifica tion for theEndpoint Device Model, it does not contain anydefinition of objects, attributes, services, or behavioraldescriptions that are already defined in theSensor/Actuator Network Common Device Model(CDM). Additional attributes, attribute assignments,services and/or service parameters that are EndpointDevice specific and/or implementation specific arecontained in this specification.3.3 While this specification is suff icient to completelydescribe the EPD as it appears from the network, it doesnot fully describe behavior of a specific endpoint devicetype which is not visible from the network. This allowsflexibility in implementation techniques and productdifferentiation between manufacturers. Manufacturerspecific objects may be defined by the manufacturer butare, by definition, outside the scope of this standard.3.4 This specification is compatibl e, but not compliantwith SEMI E39. This means that although thisspecification does not require compliance with SEMIE39, it is extensible such that implementations may bedeveloped that are fully compliant with both standards.Note that the concepts and terminology of thisspecification are compatible with those of SEMI E39.

If the device does not support the ENDPOINTIDLE state then the endpoint object goes immediatelyto the ENDPOINT ON / ENDPOINT IN PROCESSstate. If the State attribute is already set to ENDPOINTIDLE or ENDPOINT IN PROCESS, the endpointobject is set to the appropriate state. If the device turnson successfully, a success response is returned. If thedevice fails to turn on properly, a fail response isreturned and the endpoint object remains in theappropriate state.8.5.2.2 Endpoint Off (Required)  Th is service isused to prompt the endpoint object to go immediately tothe ENDPOINT OFF state from the ENDPOINT ONstate as defined by the State attribute. All endpointdetection event processes are aborted and all activetimers are stopped. If the state attribute is already set toENDPOINT OFF, the endpoint object remains in theappropriate state. If the device turns off successfully, asuccess response is returned. If the device fails to turnoff properly, a fail response is returned and theendpoint object remains in the current state.8.5.2.3 Endpoint Start (Optional)  T his service isused to prompt the endpoint object to go from theENDPOINT OFF or ENDPOINT IDLE state to theENDPOINT IN PROCESS state and begin the endpointdetection event process with the initial endpointattribute parameter values. If the State attribute is not currently in the ENDPOINT OFF or ENDPOINT IDLEstate, an object state conflict error response isreturned and the endpoint event remains in theappropriate state.8.5.2.4 Endpoint Suspend (Optional)  This service isused to prompt the endpoint object to go from theENDPOINT IN PROCESS state to the ENDPOINTSUSPENDED state and suspend the endpoint detectionevent process. All active timers are suspended and heldat their current values.

Additional specific behavior associatedwith the Sensor-BI-TH-EP object is defined below.8.5.3.1 Sensor-BI-EP OPERATING A pplicationProcess  When in the ENDPOINT ON / ENDPOINTIN PROCESS state, the Value attribute is set toFALSE and the Reading Value attribute is set toVALID. A reading, or readings, may be retrieved fromthe device physical signal processing electronics. Thisreading may be filtered, analyzed, and corrected with amanufacturer-specified algorithm. This correctedreading becomes the input to the endpoint formula togenerate the Value attribute as referenced in SEMIE54.1. This process is called endpoint detection andis executed only when the Sensor-BI-TH-EP object is inthe OPERATING state as defined in SEMI E54.1.When an Endpoint event is detected, the Valueattribute is set to TRUE and the Reading Validattribute is VALID. When not in the OPERATINGstate, the value of the Reading Valid attribute shall beset to INVALID. When in one of the sub-states of theOPERATING state, the validity of the Value attributeshall be manufacturer specific. Required sub-stateswithin the OPERATING state, descriptions of thesesub-states, and a transition matrix associated with thesesub-states are given in Figure 2, Table 16 and Table 17respectively.8.5.3.1.1 Whenever a Sensor Not Detec ted alarm,Endpoint Failure alarm or Unexpected Conditions Detected alarm is active, the EPD device shall turn offthe endpoint detection event process and hold thedevice in the ENDPOINT OFF state until the alarmclears (see Section 8.2).8.5.3.1.2 A device can concurrently mo nitor andreport many endpoint detection events. The number ofendpoint detection events varies by vendor and devicemodel.8.5.3.1.3 The Value attributes for all S ensor-BI-TH-EP objects shall be held at FALSE until a validendpoint detection event is determined. An endpointdetection event is initiated when the endpoint servicerequest Endpoint Start or Endpoint On (if the stateENDPOINT ON / ENDPOINT IDLE is not supported)is received and the endpoint object can successfullytransition to the ENDPOINT ON / ENDPOINT INPROCESS state.8.5.3.1.4 When attempting to set the M inimumTime, Maximum Time, and Target Time attributeto a value above the capability of the endpoint detectionevent an error response shall be generated indicating aninvalid operation has been attempted.8.5.3.1.5 When attempting to set the R ecipeIdentifier or Step Identifier attribute to an identifieroutside the range of the endpoint detection event anerror response shall be generated indicating an invalidoperation has been attempted.

Current editionapproved by the North American Information and Control Committee on April 30, 2001. Initially availableat www.semi.org May 2001; to be published July 2001.E This standard was editorially modified in September 2001 to correct a typographical error and the omissionof a required disclaimer. Section 2.3 was added and changes were made to Section 7.6.2.6. 1 Purpose1.1 This specification is part of the SEMISensor/Actuator Network (SAN) suite of standards anddefines a specific communications protocol based onthe CC-Link standard. This Network CommunicationStandard (NCS) taken together with the SEMISensor/Actuator Network standard suite and the CC-Link standard completely and unambiguously definesan open standard providing an industry specific solutionto off-the-shelf interoperability of networked devices insemiconductor manufacturing equipment.1.2 CC-Link is a vendor independent, open devicelevel network standard. Vendor independence andopenness are guaranteed by the CC-Link PartnerAssociation. 2 Scope2.1 This document specifies a SAN communicationsstandard based on the CC-Link specification that is incompliance with SEMI E54.1. As such, it specifies theprotocol, services and behavior that compliantintelligent devices must support in order to interchangeinformation over this SAN in a method compatible withSEMI E39.2.2 In conjunction with a SEMI standard SANCommon Device Model (CDM) specification and oneor more SEMI standard Specific Device Model (SDM)specifications (e.g., for a mass flow controller), thisNetwork Communication Standard (NCS) with therelated CC-Link standard describe the data structures,interactions and behavior that are characteristic of thevarious devices on the network. This composite modelforms a complete interoperability standard forcommunications among intelligent sensors, actuatorsand controllers in semiconductor manufacturingequipment.2.3 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This document specifies a semiconductorequipment SAN based solely on CC-Link; thus, acomplete specification of this standard necessarilyincludes the CC-Link specifications. There are othersemiconductor equipment SAN communicationsoptions. The specifications for these options are notincluded here.3.2 The specifications within are strictly enhancementsthat provide additional capabilities over and abovethose currently required by CC-Link. Includedthroughout this document, primarily in Section 6, isinformation paraphrased from the CC-Linkspecifications  such as: protocol structure,capabilities, options and limitations. This information isprovided here for reference only and is not intended toprovide specification definitions. In all such areas, referto the CC-Link specification documents forinformation. This document is limited to describingenhancements or limitations to the CC-Linkspecification that are imposed by this standard.3.3 A complete specification of the conformancetesting procedure shall include the CC-Link protocolconformance testing specification.

SEMI E54.13-0303 © SEMI 20031 SEMI E54.13-0303SPECIFICATION FOR SENSOR/ACTUATOR NETWORKCOMMUNICATIONS FOR ETHERNET/IP™ This specification was technically approved by the Global Information and Control Committee and is thedirect responsibility of the North American Information and Control Committee. Current edition approvedby the North American Regional Standards Committee on November 22, 2002. Initially available atwww.semi.org January 2003; to be published March 2003. 1 Purpose1.1 Introduction1.1.1 This standard defines a communicationspecification based on the EtherNet/IP 1(Ethernet/Industrial Protocol) network to enablecommunications between intelligent devices on asensor/actuator network (SAN) that operate accordingto SEMI specified device models (common and devicespecific) in a semiconductor manufacturing tool.1.2 Motivation1.2.1 EtherNet/IP is a communication system suitablefor use in industrial environments. EtherNet/IP allowsintelligent devices to exchange time-critical applicationinformation. These devices include simple I/O devicessuch as sensors/actuators, as well as complex controldevices such as robots, programmable logic controllers,and process controllers.1.2.2 EtherNet/IP uses CIP (Control and InformationProtocol), the common network, transport andapplication layers also shared by DeviceNet (SEMIE54.4). EtherNet/IP provides: A cost effective solution to bridge factory Ethernet(IEEE 802.3) networks to SEMI E54.4 DeviceNetlow-level device networks, Access to intelligence present in low-level devices,and Producer/Consumer model for Master/Slave andPeer-to-Peer application relationships.1.3 Background1.3.1 EtherNet/IP makes use of standard Ethernet andTCP/IP technology to transport CIP communicationspackets. The result is a common, open applicationlayer on top of open and highly popular Ethernet andTCP/IP protocols.1.3.2 EtherNet/IP provides a producer/consumer modelfor the exchange of time-critical control data. Theproducer/consumer model allows the exchange of 1 EtherNet/IP is a trademark of Open DeviceNet Vendor Association(ODVA) application information between a sending device (e.g.,the producer) and many receiving devices (e.g., theconsumers) without the need to send the data multipletimes to multiple destinations. For EtherNet/IP, this isaccomplished by making use of the CIP network andtransport layers along with IP Multicast technology.Many EtherNet/IP devices can receive the sameproduced piece of application information from a singleproducing device.1.3.3 EtherNet/IP makes use of standard IEEE 802.3technology; there are no non-standard additions thatattempt to improve determinism. Rather, EtherNet/IPrecommends the use of commercial switch technology,with 100 Mbps bandwidth and full-duplex operation, toprovide for more deterministic performance. 2 Scope2.1 Specification  This document specifies aSensor/Actuator Network Communications Standard(NCS) based on the EtherNet/IP specification thatenables communication with SAN devices configuredaccording to SEMI SAN Common Device Model(CDM) and appropriate Specific Device Model (SDM)specifications.2.2 Use  This document is used in conjunction with aSEMI standard SAN CDM specification and one ormore SEMI standard SDM specifications (e.g. for amass flow controller). Together, they describe theexternally visible data structure and behavior of devicesutilizing the EtherNet/IP networking capability in aSEMI compliant SAN system. The generalsensor/actuator network document architecture isdescribed in the SEMI E54.0 Sensor/Actuator NetworkStandard (the root SAN document).2.3 Document Structure The EtherNet/IP networkcommunication standard complies with the SEMI SANNCS template document structure, as described inSEMI E54.0. The standard document is composed oftwo main parts. The first part (Sections 1 through 8)specifies the SAN enabling protocol as well as thepresentation (i.e., mapping) of CDM object structureand behavior onto the network (referred to as theCDM mapping). The second part (Section 9)specifies the presentation (i.e., mapping) of SDM object
