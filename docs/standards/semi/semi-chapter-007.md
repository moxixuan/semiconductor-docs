SEMI E47.1-0305 © SEMI 1997, 2005 16 6.8 Human Handles  All handles for use by humans must either be contained within the maximum outerdimensions of the FOUP, be detached when not in use, or be retractable into the maximum outer dimensions whennot in use. Although such handles may extend past x53, they must still be contained within the upper limits of x50,y40, and r67. Handles for use by humans (if present) must follow SEMI S8, and they must require the use of bothhands (each using a full wrap-around grip, given the minimum clearance requirement in SEMI E15.1). Automationhandling features shall not be considered dual purpose unless they are designed to meet SEMI S8 guidelines.6.9 Automation Handling Features  On the top of the FOUP is a robotic handling flange for manipulating theFOUP. Shown in Figure 12 (on the top robotic handling flange) are a center hole and 3 optional kinematic grooves(which, if present, must be implemented entirely including the radius at the peak). On the left and right sides of theFOUP are optional flanges (of unspecified thickness) for use with fork lifts. On the bottom of the FOUP are rails foruse with roller conveyors. Although they are only required to extend x58 to the rear and y58 to the left and right, it isrecommended that they be as long as possible. Beyond x58 and y58, only the lower bounds on z43 and z46 apply.The side fork-lift flanges and the left and right bottom conveyor rails of the FOUP also have vertical cylindrical pinholes for fork lift centering. On the bottom edges of the FOUP, 2 required conveyor rails (defined by x56, x57, y58,and z43) are located on the left and right, and an optional conveyor rail (defined by x58, y56, y57, and z43) is locatedon the rear. The Optional Conveyor Placement Volume is a volume of space reserved for the inclusion of alternateconveyor features (defined by y244 and y245, the Horizontal Datum Plane and z316, and -

SEMI E47.1-0305 © SEMI 1997, 200517 6.12 FOUP Placement Sensing Pads  The FOUP must have the same carrier sensing pads as is required of thecassette in SEMI E1.9, including the info pads that communicate information about the carrier such as the carriercapacity (number of wafers) and type (cassette or FOUP). See SEMI E1.9 for information about info padconfigurations for different wafer carriers similar to FOUPs including front-opening shipping boxes (as defined inSEMI M31) and single-wafer interface (SWIF) systems (as defined in SEMI E103). Two additional sensing pads(that can be used continuously while the FOUP is advancing into the FIMS interface) must be located near the centerof the bottom at the same distance from the horizontal datum plane as the carrier sensing pads. In addition, thesurfaces on the door of the FOUP that mate with the seal zones and the reserved spaces for vacuum application mayalso be used for door-presence sensing. 7 Related Documents7.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E63  Provisional Mechanical Specification for 300 mm Box Opener/Loader to Tool Standard (BOLTS-M)InterfaceSEMI E103  Provisional Mechanical Specification for a 300 mm Single-Wafer Box System that Emulates aFOUPSEMI M31  Provisional Mechanical Specification for Front-Opening Shipping Box Used to Transport and Ship300 mm WafersNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.

SEMI E47.1-0305 © SEMI 1997, 2005 18 APPENDIX 1APPLICATION NOTES NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI E47.1 and was approved by full letter ballotprocedures on August 27, 2001.A1-1 The automation handling features do not need to be molded into the plastic shell of the FOUP, but can beattached as a framework around the shell.A1-2 To increase the stability of the FOUP on the kinematic couplings, it is recommended that the points on theFOUP bottom extend as close as practical to the horizontal datum plane to minimize tipping of the FOUP.A1-3 Skewness, warp, rock, and stiffness are implicitly defined in the geometric tolerances.A1-4 Dimension y52 is given as a maximum based on the maximum distance to the port door specified in SEMIE62.A1-5 The position tolerance of the door of the FOUP is likely to be much larger than the position tolerance of theregistration pins. To make both manual and automated door opening easier, it is recommended that the holes for theregistration pins on the door of the FOUP have openings with a lead-in capability.NOTE A1-1: If the bottom of the FOUP does not extend below the bottom conveyor rail, the conveyor rail may becomecontaminated and may distribute particles.A1-6 Although both of the retaining features on the bottom of the FOUP must be able to withstand a force in anydirection of f60, continuously applied stress may result in plastic deformation.A1-7 In order to minimize particle generation when the FOUP door is opened or closed, it is recommended that thetolerance between the FOUP door and its frame be larger than the tolerance between the FOUP door registrationholes and FIMS registration pins.A1-8 One type of carrier presence sensor uses a beam of light with an optical detector that is triggered when thebeam of light is attenuated as it passes through the FOUP shell.A1-9 The use of the registration pins for FOUP door lead-in to the loadport door is not recommended. Theregistration pins should be only used to limit the maximum displacement of the FOUP door while on the loadportdoor. Neither the FOUP nor FOUP door positions should change as a result of engaging or disengaging theregistration pins. When the Loadport experiences utility loss (such as EMO, vacuum loss, electrical failure, etc.),the registration pins may be used to maintain the FOUP doors position, and to ensure that the FOUP door does notfall off. The clearance between the Registration Pins and the Registration Pin Holes should be less than theclearance between the outer edge of the FOUP Door and the inner edge of the FOUP Door Frame. Balancing thesetolerances is a FOUP design issue related to the E62 Seal Zone specification. The diameter of the Registration PinHoles should be designed to accommodate the Registration Pin tolerance defined in E62 (x31, z31, d31) and theRegistration Pin Hole location tolerance in a FOUP.A1-10 It is recommended that the FOUP have a capability to roughly position the FOUP door in the FOUP frameduring the door close sequence (during either return of the FOUP door or during latching of the FOUP door). Thispositioning capability should keep the clearance between the FOUP frame and the FOUP door larger than sum of theFOUP (self) tolerance and the E62 registration pin tolerance along with the FOUP doors circumference. Possiblemethods for accomplishing this may include positioning by latch motion and positioning by a slope between theFOUP frame and the FOUP door.A1-11 It is recommended that the FOUP have a lead-in mechanism on its latch key holes. This lead-in mechanismshould compensate for the FOUPs latch key hole location error, as shown in Figure A1-1.A1-12 It is recommended that the latch key hole mechanisms have some flexibility in their position for compliancewith the latch key positions. The purpose of this is to adjust for any discrepancy in rotation axis between the latchkey and the latch key hole mechanism. As shown in Figure A1-2, if only one side of the latch key pushes on theinside of the latch key hole, the latch key can not rotate more than half way.A1-13 It is recommended that the torque required to rotate the FOUP latch key holes be kept small enough that itwill not produce movement of the FOUP door in the x and z directions during latch key rotation.

&lt;!-- Page 4 --&gt;

SEMI E47.1-0305 © SEMI 1997, 200519 A1-14 It is recommended that the latch key holes be maintained in the position that unlocks the FOUP door fromthe FOUP ( = 0 ± 1° as defined in SEMI E62) while the FOUP is open and in the position that locks the FOUPdoor to the FOUP ( = 90 ± 1°) while the FOUP is closed. One method to accomplish this is to have the FOUPlatch key hole mechanisms snap into both end points of their rotation ( = 0 ± 1° and  = 90 ± 1°) using a detentmechanism. The torque required to overcome such a detent mechanism should not exceed f30 (as defined inSEMI E62).A1-15 Table A1-1 can be used for communicating the compliance of FOUPs to this standard and the optionschosen: Table A1-1 Optional Features ChecklistSection Optional Feature Choice4.3 carrier capacity (c) 13 wafersor25 wafers6.1 full 15-mm lead in provided by 3features that mate with kinematiccoupling pins Primary kinematic coupling pins yesornoandsecondary kinematic coupling pins yesorno6.8 ergonomic manual handles yesorno6.9 side fork-lift flanges yesorno6.9 3 kinematic grooves on the toprobotic handling flangeyesorno6.9 rear conveyor rail yesorno6.9.1 front conveyor surface yesorno6.12 info pad A height up (pad missing)ordown (pad present)6.12 info pad B height up (pad missing)ordown (pad present)6.12 info pad C height up (pad missing)ordown (pad present)6.12 info pad D height up (pad missing)ordown (pad present)

Figure 2 shows thenecessary footprint for the integrated SMIF on a tool.The dimensions are given with reference to SEMI E15. 5.2 The minimum distance betwee n the interface planeand the wafer transfer plane A1 is limited by thethickness of the port plate and any wafer sensingsystem. This distance should be kept as small aspossible for ergonomic reasons.5.3 The dimension A2 below the i nterface plane takesinto account the distance A1, the cassette dimensions,and the mechanical components. Process tools mustprovide this free space to allow integration of SMIF.5.4 Referring to Figure 2, it can be seen that the axisof the wafer transfer, B2, does not necessarilycorrespond to the center line of the integrated SMIFunit. This is to allow the indexing mechanism to beplaced in different locations, so that multiple ports canbe furnished, still adhering to SEMI E15.

SEMI E49.2-1104 © SEMI 1995, 20045 such that the tests are representative of the Assemblyperformance.9.1.6 For optimum results, the distance between asample port and an instrument should be minimized. Itis recommended that components comply with SEMIF57 and the assembly and design should be inaccordance with SEMI E49.7.9.1.7 Operate valves to ensure there is no entrapmentand to displace any air prior to beginning a test.9.1.8 Filter elements contained within the Assemblyunder test should not be included during a test as theymay mask results and will need to be replacedfollowing the test.9.1.9 Assemblies should be dried with Nitrogen andcapped following any testing with ultrapure water andprior to shipment.9.2 Hydrostatic Pressure Test  This test is requiredfor every Assembly shipped directly to an end user.This test may also be required periodically at otherpoints in the supply chain.9.2.1 The intent of this test is to eliminate Assemblyleaks when an assembly is initially exposed to pressureand temperature (up to and including themanufacturers maximum recommended operatingpressure and temperature) at the end users facility.The user of this test is encouraged to reviewHydrostatic Pressure and Leak Testing of PolymerPiping Systems Used in High-purity WaterApplications (Mayer, Burkhart, Rydzewski) for athorough discussion of standards, and how the physicalproperties of polymers impact testing practices.9.2.2 The Hydrostatic Pressure Test conditions are themanufacturers maximum recommended pressure atambient temperature. However, it is incumbent uponthe manufacturer to ensure that the assembly will beleak free when exposed to maximum pressure andmaximum temperature at the end users facility. If thetest conditions recommended here do not result ininitial leak free operation for the end user, it isincumbent upon the end user and manufacturer to agreeon appropriate corrective action(s) to comply with theintent of this Hydrostatic Pressure Test. This mayinclude testing at elevated media temperatures.9.2.3 Test Method9.2.3.1 Test Media  Ultrapure Water at ambienttemperature.9.2.3.2 Test Pressure  Manufacturers maximumrecommended operating pressure. 9.2.3.3 Test Procedure Flush system at maximum rated flow to removeentrapped air. Keep assembly at constant temperature during test. Pressurize to the Manufacturers maximumrecommended operating pressure and wait 15minutes. Repressurize to Manufacturers maximumrecommended operating pressure and wait 15minutes. Repressurize to Manufacturers maximumrecommended operating pressure and wait 30minutes. Repressurize to Manufacturers maximumrecommended operating pressure. Monitor the pressure for 15 minutes to ensurecompliance with Table 1 requirement of &lt; 5%decay in pressure. Record pressure readings at the beginning and endof each waiting period.9.2.4 Hydrostatic Pressure Test ExampleHydrostatic Pressure Test Example 051015202530354045 0 15 30 45 60 75Time (minutes) Pressure (psig) Figure 1Hydrostatic Pressure Test Example  Test Media: Ultrapure Water Test Media Temperature: 20C Manufacturers maximum recommended operatingpressure: 40 psig.

&lt;!-- Page 24 --&gt;

SEMI E49.2-1104 © SEMI 1995, 2004 6  Assembly is repressurized to 40 psig. During the next 15 minutes the Assembly pressureis monitored to ensure that no visible leakage orpressure loss in excess of 2 psi (5%) is observed.9.2.5 As noted in Table 1, the requirement to pass thistest is no visible leakage and pressure decay of less than5% of maximum recommended operating pressure.The actual pressure decay and results of a visibleinspection should be noted on the test report.9.3 Ultrapure Water Flush Test  This test consists ofresitivity and TOC tests and is required for everyAssembly shipped directly to an end user. These testsmay also be required periodically at other points in thesupply chain.9.3.1 Resistivity Testing Recommendations9.3.1.1 The test flow rate should be no less than themanufacturers recommended minimum flow rate forthe instrument(s) being used. The test flow rate shouldbe no more than the maximum recommended flow forthe Assembly under test or the instrument(s) beingused.9.3.1.2 Following recommended manufacturerprocedures, measure resistivity just prior to theAssembly and at the Assembly outflow.9.3.1.3 Allow the reading just prior to the Assembly tostabilize until no change outside the precision of thedevice is observed for at least 5 minutes and theresistivity meets or exceeds the specification in section7.2. Repeat the procedure at the Assembly outflow.9.3.1.4 Temperature just prior to the Assembly mustnot differ more than +/- 0.5 C when compared to thetemperature at the Assembly outflow. Otherwise, acorrection may need to be performed9.3.1.5 Ensure that instrument connections are leaktight to avoid positive bias from atmospheric CO2.9.3.1.6 The inflow and outflow may be measuredsimultaneously using a 2-channel/2-cell resistivitymeter.9.3.1.7 As noted in Table 1, the requirement to passthis test is a resistivity &gt; 18 Mohm-cm @ 25°C (77°F)and both inlet and outlet. The test report should includeinlet at outlet resistivity measurements.9.3.2 TOC Testing Recommendations9.3.2.1 The test flow rate should be no less than themanufacturers recommended minimum flow rate for theinstrument(s) being used. The test flow rate should beno more than the maximum recommended flow for theAssembly under test or the instrument(s) being used. 9.3.2.2 Refer to ASTM Method D5997-96(Reapproved 2000) when including UV persulfateoxidation or ASTM 5173-97 when using UV withoutpersulfate. It should be noted which method isincorporated.9.3.2.3 Ensure that the instrument connections are leaktight to avoid interference from atmospheric CO 2.Because TOC is determined by the difference of TotalCarbon (TC) and Total Inorganic Carbon (TIC), theTOC detection limit can be no lower than 10% of theTIC reading.9.3.2.4 Allow the readings to stabilize until at least twosuccessive readings agree within +/- 5% and the TOCadders are &lt; the value specified in Table 1.9.3.2.5 The procedure should be performed just priorto the Assembly and at the Assembly outflow.9.3.2.6 As noted in Table 1, the requirement to passthis test is TOC adders (ppb) of &lt; 7.5. Both the inletand outlet TOC measurements should be included in thetest report.9.4 Particle Testing Recommendations  These testsare required periodically to establish that the Assemblydesign is typically capable of meeting the performancecriteria in Table 1.9.4.1 The test flow rate should be no less than themanufacturers recommended minimum flow rate for theinstrument(s) being used. The test flow rate should beno more than the maximum recommended flow for theAssembly under test or the instrument(s) being used.9.4.2 Particle contribution will be determined withoutvalves being actuated. Active components such asvalves should be evaluated for particle performance atthe component level to supplement this test.9.4.3 The water supplied to the Assembly under testshould be filtered with a maximum 0.05 micron filterwith a retention value such that filtered particleconcentration is &lt; 10 particle/liter &gt; 0.1 m.9.4.4 Particle contribution testing will measure theAssembly outlet particle concentration and assumes allparticles are generated within the Assembly under test.Periodic verification of the inlet particle concentrationspecified in Section 9.4.3 should be performed andreported in accordance with Section 9.1.1. Allowableparticle adders are outlined in Table 1.9.4.5 Follow the manufacturers recommendedprocedures for the optical particle counter.9.4.6 Allow the reading to stabilize from rinse downuntil there is no change within the expected noise for 2or more intervals (i.e. no change in slope). Anappropriate sample interval should be chosen such that

&lt;!-- Page 25 --&gt;

SEMI E49.2-1104 © SEMI 1995, 20047 intervals with very small counts are not taken. Inaddition, the user should remain cognizant of therequirement in Table 1 for allowable particle adders.9.4.7 As noted in Table 1, the requirement to pass thistest is &lt; 120 allowable Particle adders (particles/L &gt; 0.1m). The outlet particle concentration and date andconcentration of most recent inlet particle concentrationverification should be noted on the test report.9.5 Anions and Metals Testing Recommendations These tests are required periodically to establish that theAssembly design is typically capable of meeting theperformance criteria in Table 1.9.5.1 The test flow rate should be no more than themaximum recommended flow for the Assembly undertest or the instrument(s) being used.9.5.2 Grab Sample Methodology for Assembly supply:Step 1: Open and close sampling valve 5 times.Step 2: Open valve full throttle and allow UPW to flowfor at least 2 minutes.Step 3: Adjust to approximately 1liter/minute andallow to flow at least 5 minutes.Step 4: Use precleaned and qualified bottles one eachfor anions and metals.Step 5: Fill to overflowing and empty the contents.Repeat 4 times. Avoid contact with the neck or insideof the cap with hands or sample port.Step 6: Minimizing the distance between the port andbottle, fill the container to the bottom of the neck.Step 7: Carefully rinse the cap and immediately secureit tightly to the bottle.9.5.3 Grab Sample Methodology for AssemblyOutflow:Step 1: Under standard assembly operation, allowoutflow to run at least 5 minutes.Step 2: Use precleaned and qualified bottles one eachfor anions and metals. Note that for convenience,outflow bottles may be prerinsed using inflow UPW.Step 3: Minimizing the distance between the outflowand bottle, fill the container to the bottom of the neck.Step 4: Carefully rinse the cap and immediately secureit to the bottle.9.5.4 Use ASTM D4327 with preconcentration toanalyze anions. Use an industry standard method withICP-MS to analyze metals. 9.5.5 Required precision for each analyte is such thatthe difference of the incoming and outgoing reading hasan error of no more than +/- 20%.9.5.6 As noted in Table 1, the requirements to pass thistest are dependent on the ionic or metallic adder. Theinlet and outlet concentrations for each analyte (orcopies of laboratory reports) should be maintained andavailable upon request. 10 Certification10.1 The supplier of an Assembly shipped to an enduser is responsible for defining, establishing, executing,and maintaining a certification program based on thetests in Section 6.10.2 By default all of the requirements within thisdocument apply unless another agreement is madebetween supplier of an Assembly shipped to an enduser and an end user.10.3 Qualification tests and certification documentsshall reflect current production practices.10.4 The certification program will specify anynecessary corrective action plan in the event that anAssembly fails to meet these requirements duringtesting.10.5 Upon request, the supplier of an Assemblyshipped to an end user is responsible for supplyingdocumentation that proves the Assembly consistentlymeets the requirements of this document.10.6 As stated in the purpose, this document is aguideline by which the purity and mechanical integrityof all ultrapure water and liquid chemical Assembliesshipped to end users may be qualified. To ensure thepurity and mechanical integrity of Assemblies shippedto end users is maintained, these guidelines must alsobe implemented throughout the supply chain. Section10.7 provides recommendations for Assemblies shippeddirectly to an end user and Section 10.8 providesrecommendations for the remainder of the supply chain.10.7 The certification program for an Assemblydelivered directly to an end user will specify thefrequency of testing and the test Assembly(s).10.7.1 Each individual Assembly delivered directly toan end user shall have the following tests performed: Hydrostatic test (See Table 1 and Sections 9.1 and9.2) Ultrapure Water Flush test (see Table 1 andSections 9.1, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2)

SEMI E49.6-1103 © SEMI 1995, 20033 7.3.3 A mutually agreeable quality program, includingsampling, should be used to inspect and testcomponents and assemblies for parameters such as:surface contamination (e.g., hydrocarbon, particulate),tubing quality, wall thickness, nicks, scratches; surfaceroughness, pits, stringers, particle count, weldability,helium leak rate (inboard/outboard/across seat), anddimensions.7.3.4 The material should be accepted only after theseincoming QA checks are completed. 8 Construction Procedures8.1 Systems shall be constructed in accordance withSEMI F78 and inspected per SEMI F81.8.2 Subsystem Assembly Protocol8.2.1 Gas panel and solvent system assembly should beperformed only by trained competent personnel.8.2.2 Proper procedures for tightening face seal andother connections, valve bonnets, regulator bonnets,and other components should be followed at all times.Manufacturers recommended assembly instructionsshould be followed at all times.8.2.3 To minimize entrained contaminants,components and subassemblies should be capped orunder purge before and after assembly. Partiallyassembled gas panels should be under purge or cappedat all times.8.2.4 Assemblers should at all times be wearing cleangloves; soiled, discolored or torn gloves should bereplaced immediately.8.2.5 Components, assemblies or subassemblies whichare dropped or damaged during the assembly processshould be red-tagged and inspected before use. Faceseal gaskets which are dropped should be discarded. 9 Assembly Qualification and QualityAssurance9.1 Tests should be successfully completed and resultsdocumented for all performance parameters (purityindices) specified.9.2 Leak rate tests should be conducted on 100% of allsubsystems per SEMI F1.9.3 Design Qualification  Gas delivery systemdesign performance should be qualified in terms of twoparameters: particulate generation and contaminantspike recovery. This testing should be performed onthe initial gas delivery system prototype and on anydesign revision which significantly impacts thecomponent selection or system configuration. Test results should be kept on file and made available to theend user upon request.9.3.1 Particulate Generation  Static and dynamicparticle testing should be performed in accordance withSEMI F70 with a flow rate of at least 3 times themaximum process flow rate at the recommended supplypressure, except during mass flow controller testingwhen test flow rates should be between 0% and 100%of the MFC value. Testing should be performed on allflow paths that differ significantly in components orconfiguration. Dynamic test protocols should be asfollows: Each valve in the test flow path should be cycledindividually. Starting with the valve furthest upstream, cycleeach valve once every 20 seconds. MFC valves should be cycled from 0% to 100%.9.3.2 Contaminant Spike Recovery  Contaminantspike recovery testing should be performed on all flowpaths which differ significantly in configuration orcomponents. This test should be performed at a flowrate equivalent to typical flow rates achieved in purgeand vent cycles for the specific flow path. Contaminantspike recovery test protocols are: With all components placed in the full openposition, mass flow gas moisture level should be atbaseline for 30 minutes prior to testing to establishstable background (&lt; 20 ppbv per ASTM F 1397 or&lt; 500 pptv per SEMI F58). When a stable background is achieved, initiate a 2ppm (v) moisture spike until the outlet moistureconcentration reaches 2 ppm. (Remove themoisture source from the test gas, and monitorelapsed time until moisture level reaches specifiedlevel.)9.4 Manufacturing Qualification  Manufacturingqualification tests should be performed to verify themanufacturing and quality control procedures followedin the manufacturing of the gas delivery system. As theconfiguration of gas systems varies greatly fromprocess to process, no specification should be givenhere other than to state that static and dynamic particletesting, moisture level, oxygen level, and hydrocarbontesting should be performed to show that the gasdelivery system will meet the purity levels required.9.5 Certification  Certification for gas deliverysystem designs should include: leak rate certification,particle counts with specified flow rates at specifiedpressures and flow schematic indicating which flowpaths were tested and which components were cycled;moisture level plotted against time with specified flow

Nitrogen is recommended for dryingcleaned wetted surfaces because the purity level isclearly defined and controlled. 8 System Design Recommendations8.1 General Recommendations  The intent of thissection is to recommend design practices that ensure thequality of the liquid being delivered. Theserecommendations should be considered along withdesign constraints such as minimizing liquidconsumption, cost, ensuring maintainability, andlimiting complexity. In addition, the appropriatenessand simplicity of the facility interface should beconsidered.8.2 Component Recommendations  Componentsshould limit system exposure to ionic, metallic, totalorganic carbon, and particle contamination.8.2.1 All applicable components should comply withSEMI F57.8.2.2 For components not addressed in SEMI F57, adiscussion of recommended materials (similar to thatfound in SEMI F57) may benefit the reader and istherefore provided.8.2.2.1 Care should be taken to ensure that thematerials are compatible with the liquid streams for long term applications. Additionally, it is importantthat the materials used be compatible with theapplication temperature and/or sanitization methodssuch as ozone, UV light and/or hydrogen peroxide.8.2.2.2 These recommendations often imply the use ofexisting materials of choice, such as high purity gradesof perfluoroalkoxy (PFA), polytetrafluoroethylene(PTFE), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).However, unique design specifications or new materialsmay result in instances where significant efficienciesmay be achieved while maintaining substantiallyequivalent performance. These scenarios could resultin the use of new or existing materials such asethylenechlorotrifluoroethylene (ECTFE), polyether-etherketone (PEEK), polypropylene (PP), acetal resin(such as Delrin®™ 3, Celcon®™ 1 and others),polyvinyl chloride (PVC), perfluoromethylether-basedperfluoroalkoxy (MFA), etc.8.2.2.3 Due to purity and traceability issues,reprocessed or regrind material is not recommended.8.3 Joining Recommendations  Joining technologythat is free of dead space and entrapment areas isrecommended to reduce negative effects such asmicrobial proliferation and impacts to slurry particlesize distribution. For this reason pipe threadconnections are not recommended.8.3.1 Tubing should be joined with flare fittings, orsimilar dead space free technology. Preparation andjoining of fittings should be performed in accordancewith component manufacturer recommendations.8.3.1.1 Care should be taken to ensure that dissimilarflare fittings are not joined together. When possible,one style of fitting should be used throughout thesystem. Manufacturers should be consulted prior tousing similar style fittings from different manufacturersinterchangeably.8.3.2 Pipe should be joined with welds that minimizedead space and entrapment areas. Preparation andwelding should be performed in accordance withcomponent manufacturers recommendations.NOTE 4: Users of this guideline are cautioned that suitablewelding methods, such as thermal butt welding, may becovered by patents or other intellectual property.8.3.2.1 Glue, solvent, or thermal socket welding ofpipe is not recommended.8.4 System Volume Recommendations  Whenpossible, dead volumes should be eliminated andoverall system volume should be minimized to reducenegative effects on purity as well as flush times. 3 Delrin is a trademark of DuPont; Celcon is a trademark of HoechstCelanese.

SEMI E49.7-0304 © SEMI 1995, 2004 4 8.4.1 In instances where dead volumes areunavoidable, the dead leg should be &lt; 3 nominal flowpath diameters.8.4.2 Examples of components and practices whichhelp minimize system volume include: Dead-space-free branch valves Multi-component integrated assemblies Use of direct flow paths Trickle bypass valves Sampling valves8.5 Flow Recommendations  Due to issues related toequipment complexity and the cost of excessive liquidconsumption, general flow recommendations forultrapure water and liquid chemical delivery systemsare not provided. However, Related Information 1provides a list of practices that tend to reduce microbialproliferation in ultrapure water Systems. Because notall liquid chemicals are subject to these effects, the useris advised to obtain additional flow information relatedto ensuring the quality of liquid chemicals from theliquid chemical manufacturer.8.6 Slurry System Recommendations  In addition tothe other design recommendations within this section,the following recommendations are providedspecifically for slurry liquid delivery systems usedwithin CMP process equipment.8.6.1 Areas of high shear can damage the quality ofmany slurries resulting in large particle count (LPC)growth. Sharp edges projecting into flow path, largepressure drops, tight bends, and sudden large reductionsin tubing size can cause high shear.8.6.2 Dead legs are of particular importance withrespect to slurries because the abrasives may settle andagglomerate, creating LPC growth. To help minimizethis issue branch lines should be oriented such that theyproject vertically above the main line to prevent theabrasive from settling and agglomerating.8.6.3 If point of use filtration is incorporated,provisions to sample the slurry before and after thefilter should be provided for LPC monitoring.8.7 Protection and Sampling Recommendations These recommendations are intended to protect liquidsfrom back flow or cross contamination and to ensurethat sampling is adequate for evaluating liquid qualitythroughout system.8.7.1 Backflow/back pressure and cross contaminationprotection should be included in the system. 8.7.2 The system should have provisions to accomplishsampling. Sampling ports should be located as close aspossible to the liquid supply point, to bath/tank orprocess chamber, and to the return header immediatelybefore exit.8.7.3 Provisions to completely flush, drain, and sanitizethe liquid system completely (with ultrapure water or 2-propanol/IPA for example) should be included in thesystem.8.8 Filtration Recommendations  Theserecommendations are intended to reduce negativeeffects such as particle contamination, metalliccontamination, and micro bubbles.8.8.1 Filters should be considered for all liquiddelivery systems. Location, selection, installation, startup, and rinse of filters should be based on input fromcustomer, chemical manufacturer and equipmentmanufacturer.8.8.2 Process stream isolation should be provided forall filters to allow for maintenance and replacement.8.9 Labeling Recommendations  In addition to therecommendations in Section 10.7, functionallabels/schematics should be included with assembly forvents, drains, and other components as necessary toensure the proper operation of the system(s).8.10 Maintainability Recommendations8.10.1 Components that require operation, inspection,or maintenance (i.e., valves, filters, pumps, gauges,etc.) should be located where readily accessible.8.10.2 Provide support on each side of components,such as valves, where operation or assembly transmitstorque to the piping/tubing.8.10.3 Design should allow for thermal expansion ifsystem operates at an elevated temperature. 9 Pre-Production Acceptance and InspectionRecommendations9.1 Identification Recommendations9.1.1 Applicable components should meet thetraceability requirements found in SEMI F57. Wherepractical, the traceability requirements of SEMI F57should also be followed for components not coveredwithin SEMI F57 and assemblies, to ensure traceabilityis provided from the resin source. Component andassembly identification should provide nondestructivepost installation traceability. In addition, packagingshould have labels allowing for traceability as describedabove that are clearly visible (without the need to openthe package).

SEMI E49.7-0304 © SEMI 1995, 20045 NOTE 5: Practical limitations such as component size maynot allow for permanent post installation marking of everycomponent.9.2 Packaging Recommendations9.2.1 Applicable components should meet thepackaging requirements found in SEMI F57. Wherepractical, the packaging requirements of SEMI F57should also be followed for other components andassemblies to avoid contamination of wetted surfaces.9.3 Documentation9.3.1 The equipment supplier should be responsible formaintaining and supplying, upon request,documentation that proves their assemblies meet theuser's performance requirements. Similar requirementsfor maintaining component documentation are coveredin SEMI F57 and are the responsibility of thecomponent manufacturer.9.4 Receiving, Inspection, and Storage9.4.1 All incoming components and assemblies shouldbe segregated until they have been formally acceptedthrough a documented procedure.9.4.1.1 Cartons should be checked visually for damage(e.g., torn bags, inadequate padding causing damage).9.4.1.2 A statistically significant sample size shouldundergo minimum QA checks such as visual inspectionand critical dimension inspection. In some instancesfurther inspection of components to ensure compliancewith SEMI F57 may be required.9.4.1.3 Components and assemblies should be stored inoriginal packaging until ready for inspection.Inspection involving opening sealed plastic bags shouldbe conducted within the staging prefab cleanroom.After inspection, heat-seal the component (and ifappropriate the assembly) into a clean and drypolyethylene bag.9.4.2 Any component or assembly failing initialinspection should be immediately red tagged and setaside in a quarantine area until the supplier of thecomponent is notified and disposition is determined.9.4.3 Components and assemblies should be acceptedonly after these incoming QA checks are completed.9.4.4 Accepted component and assemblies should havetraceability to the appropriate incoming QA check.9.4.5 Components and assemblies should be stored inthe original shipping containers when possible. Pipemay be stored on racks with appropriate supports. 9.5 Staging9.5.1 Prior to entry into the cleanroom components andassemblies should have the outer bag removed and theinner bag wiped down with cleanroom wipes using 2-propanol/IPA or 2-propanol/IPA and ultrapure watermix in the staging area. 10 Assembly Recommendations10.1 General10.1.1 Assembly should take place inassembly/cleanroom (see Section 6.5).10.1.2 Inner bags should be removed within theassembly/cleanroom.NOTE 6: In the event components must be handled outsidecleanroom areas, personnel should wear protective gloves atall times and components returning to the cleanroom shouldbe clean. All ends should be capped to avoid exposure ofwetted surfaces.10.1.3 If work must stop for an extended period,assemblies should be purged with nitrogen and cappedimmediately to isolate wetted materials fromcontamination.10.2 Pipe/Tube Cutting10.2.1 Use dedicated clean tools for piping/tubingsystem fabrication and installation. Clean tools at thestart of each shift with 2-propanol/IPA, rinse withultrapure water, and blow dry with nitrogen. Maintaintools in accordance with manufacturersrecommendations.10.2.2 Cut piping/tubing in accordance withmanufacturers recommendations. Saws are prohibited.10.2.3 The cut end of the pipe/tube should be finishedbefore use to comply with the manufacturersrecommendations for squareness and finish. Cutsurfaces should be clean and free of loose particles anddebris.10.3 Component and Assembly Cleaning10.3.1 What follows are limited and generalrecommendations for cleaning components orassemblies. It is the equipment manufacturersresponsibility to ensure that cleaning procedures andsolutions are adequate and do not impact equipmentperformance.10.3.1.1 Every effort should be made to keep theinterior of the pipe clean during cutting and prepping.If, however, the pipe has become contaminated andnitrogen (Section 7.1) will not dislodge the particles itcan be cleaned by blowing an ultrapure water soakedswab (often called a pig) through it using nitrogen(see Section 7.1). The pig should be constructed of a

&lt;!-- Page 47 --&gt;

SEMI E49.7-0304 © SEMI 1995, 2004 6 clean, unused, cleanroom approved, cloth soaked inultrapure water and wrapped around a plug of adiameter less than the ID of the pipe to be cleaned. Thelength of the pig should be about 2 its diameter.10.3.1.2 Components or assemblies that have becomecontaminated should be cleaned. The procedure forcleaning cannot be defined but frequently includes: Rinse in ultrapure water. Soak in cleaning solution if necessary andcompatible with process Rinse in flowing ultrapure water (see Section 7.2). After rinse, check cleanliness. If necessary, repeat the procedure until clean.10.3.1.3 Any assemblies that have been wetted in acleaning process shall be dried with Nitrogen.10.3.2 Use 2-Propanol/IPA to remove any inkmarkings from the exterior of the pipe.10.4 Welded ConnectionsNOTE 7: Refer to Sections 8.3 and 8.3.2 for general joiningand weld recommendations.10.4.1 Welder Qualification10.4.1.1 Welders should have prior experience in thespecific welding method of specific types of polymercomponents. To be qualified, the welder should be ableto safely cut, prep, clean, purge, fit, and weld the sizesfor which he or she is seeking qualification and produceconsistently acceptable weld joints. It is recommendedthat welders undergo weld training and certification bya pipe manufacturer.10.4.2 Weld Qualification10.4.2.1 During fabrication, each welder should submitweld samples daily to the QA manager at the beginningof the shift. The welds should be representative of thetypes of welds the welder will perform during the shift.10.4.2.2 These welds should meet a defined criteria ofacceptability, which may include inspection for visiblediscoloration, uniformity of weld area, maximum weldmisalignment, and weld bead height. These criteriamay be derived from sources such as the componentmanufacturer, the process equipment manufacturer, andthe end user. General recommendations for weldinspection are included in Section 10.4.4.10.4.3 Welding Procedures10.4.3.1 In general the use of weld methods thatminimize dead space and entrapment areas are thepreferred means of welding plastic pipe/tubing (i.e., PVDF, PFA, and Polypropylene). The weld methodshould be as shown on the fabrication drawings.NOTE 8: Users of this guideline are cautioned that suitablewelding methods, such as thermal butt welding, may becovered by patents or other intellectual property. Whenpossible, use reduced bead welding method and fixturing toreduce areas on inside diameter where bacteria mayaccumulate.10.4.3.2 Welding equipment should be maintained inaccordance with manufacturer recommendations. Forexample, tools and heating elements should be keptclean and thermostat should be calibrated regularly.10.4.3.3 Components should be firmly and accuratelyclamped in the welding equipment. Check alignmentand clamp adjustment regularly.10.4.3.4 Logs should be kept for each weld to ensuretraceability back to the welding equipment, welder, dateof weld, and inspector.10.4.4 Weld Inspection CriteriaNOTE 9: Refer to manufacturer recommendations for socketweld inspection criteria.10.4.4.1 All welds should exhibit little or no visiblediscoloration.10.4.4.2 The maximum weld misalignment should be10% of the wall thickness of the material.10.4.4.3 Visual inspection for voids should beperformed in accordance with manufacturersrecommendations.10.4.4.4 The physical characteristics of the weld beadshould be in accordance with criteria which may bederived from component manufacturer, processequipment manufacturer, and end userrecommendations.10.5 Mechanical ConnectionsNOTE 10: Joining technology that is free of dead space andentrapment areas is recommended. See Sections 8.3 and 8.3.1for general joining recommendations and specific mechanicalconnection recommendations. In the event that theserecommendations cannot be followed, assemblyrecommendations for other commonly used mechanicalconnections are provided.10.5.1 Flaring should be performed at the temperatureand with the equipment recommended by the fittingmanufacturer.10.5.2 O-rings used in mechanical connections shouldbe positioned per manufacturer recommendationsbefore closing the fitting.

Manufacturer recommendations fortorque should be applied.10.5.4 For tapered threaded connections, such asNational Pipe Thread (NPT) and Japanese IndustrialStandard (JIS), wrap tapered threads with a suitabletape, (such as PTFE tape) prior to assembly. Use of wide tape is recommended on nominal sizes of  orsmaller. Wrap the threads three times in the directionthat does not unravel during installation of the fitting.To reduce the possibility of tape entering the liquidstream, do not cover the last two threads at the narrowend of the fitting.10.6 Tubing and Pipe Support10.6.1 Route flexible tubing neatly and secure with tie-wraps or similar mechanical fastener.10.6.2 Support distances and support clamps for pipeshould employ the manufacturers recommendations,where possible. These clamps typically cradle the pipewithin a plastic fixture. Metal and/or constrictive typesof clamps may induce stress into piping componentsand should be avoided. However, if they must be usedthen elastomer inserts between the pipe and clamp arerecommended.10.7 Labeling Recommendations10.7.1 All ultrapure water and Liquid Chemicalsystems should be labeled in accordance with SEMIF34 when possible.10.7.2 Additional labeling to support proper operationof the system(s) should be included when indicated onassembly drawing(s).10.8 Final Assembly Inspection Recommendations10.8.1 Inspect the system within the appropriateassembly environment.10.8.2 Verify the following: System is complete per drawings Critical dimensions, squareness, offsets, andstraightness are per drawings and assemblyspecifications Overall configuration is correct Support is adequate No pipe, tube, or fitting is nicked, cracked, orabused Each weld is visually acceptable Gaskets are in place and bolts are torqued to propervalues  Proper installation of valves per manufacturersrecommendations Unions and mechanical connections are tight Tubing, pipe, inlets, and outlets are labeledappropriately10.8.3 Shop drawings that have been marked up shouldbe returned to the engineering department for updates.The QA manager should be notified that the assemblyhas passed inspection, been tagged as such, and is readyfor final testing. 11 System Testing Recommendations11.1 The equipment manufacturer should successfullycomplete functional testing (for example leak andpressure decay testing). In addition, testing may berequired to demonstrate that the system is not adverselyaffecting the quality of the liquid.11.2 Any assemblies that have been wetted duringtesting shall be dried with Nitrogen.NOTE 11: As outlined in limitations Section 3.1, it is beyondthe scope of this document to define the performancerequirements of the equipment systems. 12 Packaging Recommendations12.1 Packaging is recommended to ensure thecleanliness and dryness of wetted surfaces duringtransport or storage. All open connections should becapped to isolate wetted materials from contamination.Additional guidelines for packaging can be found inother SEMI documents.
