3  Definition of Terms
3. 1  blister (bubble) ceramic — an  enclosed, localized
separation  within  or  between  the  layers  of  a  ceramic
package  that  does  not  expose  an  underlying  layer  of
ceramic or metallization.
3. 2    blister   (bubble)   metallization   —    an   enclosed,
localized  separation  of  a  metallization  layer  from  its
base  material  (such  as  ceramic  or  another  metal  layer)
that does not expose the underlying layer.
3. 3  braze — in semiconductor pac kages, an alloy used
to  attach  pins,  leads,  seal  rings  and  heat  sinks/studs  to
the package.
3. 4  burr — an adherent fragment o f parent material at
a component edge. In leadframes, the metal burr, due to
the  stamping  operation,  may  be  in  the  horizontal  or
vertical  direction  to  the  surface.  In  ceramic  packages,
this type of characteristic is called a fin.
3. 5   castellations  —  metallized  sem i-circular  channels
on  chip  carrier  edges  which  provide  contact  between
internal  package  metallization  traces  and  the  external
test  pads.  These  castellations  provide  for  improved
solder  fillets  during  attachment  to  a  circuit  board  (see
Figure 1).
3. 6   cavity-down  packages  —  pack ages  where  the  die
surface faces the mounting board. (See Figure 2 for the
pin     grid     array     packages     in     the     cavity-down
configuration.  It  is  more  usual  to  refer  to  the  chip
carrier  mounting  surfaces  as  the  seating  planes.  In  this
cavity  orientation,  the  seating  plane  is  Seating  Plane  2
per JEDEC JC-11.)
3. 7  cavity-up  packages  —  package s  where  the  die
surface   faces   away   from   the   mounting   board   (see
Figure 2 or Seating Plane 1 for chip carriers).
3. 8  chip   —   region   of   material   mis sing   from   a
component  (e.g.,  ceramic  from  a  package,  or  solder
from   a   preform).   The   region   does   not   progress
completely  through  the  component  and  is  formed  after
the component is manufactured. Chip size is defined by
its  length,  width  and  depth  from  a  projection  of  the
design platform. Also called chipout (see Figure 1).
3. 9  co-fired — in the manufacturin g of some types of
ceramic  packages,  the  technology  used  to  join  together
various   ceramic   layers   and   metallization   patterns
screened  onto  those  layers  by  simultaneous  firing  at
high temperature.
3. 10   contact  pad  —  in  a  leadless  ch ip  carrier  or  land
grid  array,  the  metallized  areas  on  the  bottom  of  the
package that provide contact point between the internal
leads  and  connecting  external  circuitry.  They  are  also
used for electrical test pads.
3. 11  crack — a cleavage or fracture  that extends to the
surface  of  a  semiconductor  package  or  solder  preform.
The  crack  may  or  may  not  pass  through  the  entire
thickness of the package or preform.
3. 12     critical    seal    area    (ceramic)    —     on    a
semiconductor   package,   the   area   bounded   by   the
shortest   nominal   design   distance   from   the   largest
cavity,  usually  the  wire  bond  cavity,  to  the  edge  of  the
package or ceramic layer forming the seal area.
3. 13   critical  seal  area  —  metallizat ion  or  metal  ring
—  The  entire  area  of  the  seal  ring;  it  applies  to  plated
refractory metal or a metal ring.
3. 14  critical    seal    path    (ceramic)    —     on    a
semiconductor  package,  the  shortest  nominal  design
distance  from  the  largest  cavity,  usually  the  wire  bond
cavity,  to  the  edge  of  the  package  or  ceramic  layer
forming the seal area.
3. 15  delamination  —  in  a  co-fired  c eramic  package,
chip  carrier,  pin  grid  array,  etc.,  the  separation  of  one
ceramic layer from another.
3. 16  element  (packaging)  —  part  of   a  semiconductor
package   feature   (e.g.,   package   leads   have   braze
paddle/stand-off  and  contact  elements,  pins  have  the
nail head/braze area and contact elements).
3. 17   fin  —  on  a  ceramic  package  or   cap,  a  fine
feathery-edged projection of parent ceramic material on
the corner of the ceramic body.
3. 18  flatness  —  in  a  ceramic  packag e  or  leadframe,
the  allowable  deviation  of  a  surface  from  a  defined
reference  plane.  The  tolerance  zone  is  defined  by  two
parallel planes within which the surface must lie.
3. 19  foreign  material  —  an  adheren t  particle  that  is
not parent material of the component. Adherence means
that the particle cannot be removed by an air or nitrogen
blast at 20 psi.
3. 20  heat exchange area — a metal lized region on one
major  surface  of  the  package  to  which  heat  sinks  may
be attached by brazing, soldering, or adhesive resin.
3. 21  layer  —  on  a  cofired  ceramic  p ackage,  the  body
is  made  from  layers  of  ceramic  or  metallized  ceramic.
The   layers   are   defined   by   their   functionality,   and
several  ceramic  layers  may  be  described  as  comprising
one functional layer if all are common in plan-form and
function (e.g., die attach cavity) (see Figure 4).
3. 22  lead  offset  —  in  brazed  lead  ce ramic  packages,
the  variation  in  position  of  the  centerline  of  the  lead
with  reference  to  the  centerline  of  the  braze  pad  to
which it is mounted.
3. 23  lead  sweep  —  lead  movement ,  measured  with
respect  to  a  datum,  perpendicular  to  the  top  or  bottom</p><p>SEMI G61-94 © SEMI 19943
of  the  package  that  passes  through  the  designed  mid-
point  of  the  lead  where  the  lead  is  attached  to  the
package (e.g., side-brazed laminates), or where the lead
exits   the   package   body   (e.g.,   plastic   dual-in-line
packages).  The  movement  is  viewed  from  the  side  of
the package, not the ends.
3. 24  lead-to-lead  separation  —  the   distance  between
adjacent  leads  when  measured  from  their  centerlines  at
the point of connection to the package.
3. 25  lead  tweeze  —  lead  movement ,  measured  with
respect  to  a  datum,  perpendicular  to  the  top  or  bottom
of  the  package  that  passes  through  the  designed  mid-
point  of  the  lead  where  the  lead  is  attached  to  the
package (e.g., side-brazed laminates), or where the lead
exits   the   package   body   (e.g.,   plastic   dual-in-line
packages).  The  movement  is  viewed  from  the  ends  of
the  package,  not  the  side  and  the  lead  movement  is
from  the  edges  of  the  package  in  toward  the  centerline
of the package.
3. 26  metallization  void  —  the  absen ce  of  a  clad,
evaporated,   plated   or   screen-printed   metal   layer   or
braze  from  a  designated  area.  Also  called  metal  or
plating void.
3. 27 peeling  (flaking)  —  any  separa tion  of  a  plated,
vacuum-deposited,  or  clad  metal  layer  from  the  base
metal of a leadframe, pin heatsink, or seal ring, from an
underplate,  or  from  a  refractory  metal  on  a  ceramic
package.  Peeling exposes the underlying metal.
3. 28  pin  offset  —  the  variation  in  po sition  from  the
centerline of the pin to the centerline of the braze pad to
which it is mounted.
3. 29  pin  sweep  —  pin  movement,  m easured  with
respect  to  a  datum,  perpendicular  to  the  top  or  bottom
of  the  package  that  passes  through  the  designed  mid-
point  of  pin  where  the  pin  is  attached  to  the  package
(e.g.,  pin  grid  arrays).  The  movement  is  viewed  form
the side of the package, not the ends.
3. 30  pin-to-pin  separation  —  the  di stance  between
adjacent  pins  when  measured  from  their  centerlines  at
the point of connection to the package.
3. 31  pin  tweeze  —  pin  movement,  m easured  with
respect  to  a  datum,  perpendicular  to  the  top  or  bottom
of  the  package  that  passes  through  the  designed  mid-
point  of  pin  where  the  pin  is  attached  to  the  package
(e.g.,  pin  grid  arrays).  The  movement  is  viewed  form
the  ends  of  the  package,  not  the  side  and  the  pin
movement  is  from  the  edges  of  the  package  in  toward
the centerline of the package.
3. 32  pit  —  in  semiconductor  packa ges,  plastic  or
ceramic,  or  in  the  leadframes,  a  shallow  depression  or
crater. The bottom of the depression must be visible in
order  for  the  term  to  apply.  A  pit  is  formed  during
component manufacture (see Figure 3).
3. 33  porous   surface   —   an   uncompa cted   ceramic
surface often showing fine pits.
3. 34  projection   —   on   a   semiconduc tor   package
(plastic    or    ceramic),    leadframe    or    preform,    and
irregularly raised portion of a surface indigenous to the
parent material.
3. 35  pullback  —  on  a  semiconducto r  package,  the
linear  distance  between  the  edge  of  a  cavity  cut  into  a
ceramic   layer   and   the   first   measurable   glass   or
metallization layer interface coated onto the top surface
of that layer. The total pullback may be the result of the
high  temperature  processing  required  to  manufacture
the  package  or  to  coat  the  surface.  It  may  also  be  the
result of design considerations (see Figure 5).
3. 36  rundown  —  on  a  semiconduct or  package,  the
linear  distance  from  the  upper  surface  of  a  ceramic
cavity layer to the bottom point of the overhang into the
cavity, of a sealing glass or metallization layer that has
been screened onto that surface (see Figure 5).
3. 37  scrape  —  the  irregular  remova l  of  a  deposited
layer  from  a  base  material  by  a  shearing  action  from
another  surface  such  that  the  base  material  is  exposed
over an extended area. It can also apply to the removal
of surface layers from a material. The material removed
from the scraped area may build up at the edges of the
scrape. The deposited layer may be a metal or glass.
3. 38  seal  area  —  on  a  semiconduct or  package,  the
area  designated  for  sealing  a  cover  or  lid  to  a  cofired
ceramic  package,  or  a  cap  to  a  cer-DIP  or  cer-pack
base. In the case of a co-fired ceramic package the seal
area  may  be  either  bare  ceramic  for  glass  sealing  or  a
metallized  area  for  solder  sealing.  The  metallized  seal
area may be a plating over refractory metallization or a
metal   ring,   usually   iron-nickel-cobalt   or   iron-nickel
alloys, brazed to the refractory metal.
3. 39  seating  plane  —  in  plug-in  pac kages  such  as
dual-in-line (side-brazed or cer-DIP) or pin grid arrays,
the plane defined by the three lowest stand-off features
on the lead or pins as measured from the bottom of the
package,  or  in  the  absence  of  these  features,  by  the
package  base  or  mounting  plane  (see  Figure  6).  The
features,  such  as  shoulders  or  projections,  hold  the
package  off  the  circuit  board  to  which  it  is  mounted.
This  gap  allows  solder  flux  and  residues  to  be  cleaned
after  soldering  the  device  and,  in  some  cases,  to  allow
for  sufficient  cooling  air  flow  around  the  device.  A
prescribed  force  is  used  to  hold  the  device  in  the
mounting   holes   when   the   seating   plane   is   to   be
measured.</p><p>SEMI G61-94 © SEMI 19944
3. 40  side-to-side  misalignment  —  t he  offset  of  the
center  lines  of  corresponding  leads  or  pins  from  one
side of the package to another side.
3. 41  stand-off  —  the  separation  bet ween  the  base
plane  and  the  seating  plane  that  is  created  by  physical
features  that  are  usually  formed  into  the  pins  or  leads
(see  Figure  6).  The  features  may  also  be  called  stand-
offs.
3. 42  TIR — total Indicator Reading .

A1-1  Purpose
The  purpose  of  this  appendix  is  to  indicate  that  speed
and  height  of  the  die  contact  tool  affect  die  shear
strength results.
A1-2  Test Results</p><p>Figure A1-1
Tool Velocity Test Results</p><p>Figure A1-2
Tool Height Test Results</p><p>A1-2.1  Summary
A1-2.1.1  Shear Speed
a.     Some  adhesive  might  yield  variable  results  due  to
the  relationship  of  the  shear  speed  and  failure
speed.
b.    Some equipment with high shear speed could yield
low  strength  due  to  poor  sensitivity  at  the  peak  of
the load.
A1-2.1.2  Height of the Die Contact Tool
a.     In  case  of  low  height,  fillet  level  might  affect  the
strength.
b.     In  case  of  high  height,  a  variable  result  might  be
obtained since the tool pulls the die and it tears the
adhesive.</p><p>NOTICE:      SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or

1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  This  test  method  describes  an  evaluation  method
for  bending  characteristics  of  leadframe  materials  used
for L-leaded packages.
NOTE 1:  The   lead   fatigue   test   described   in   MIL-STD-
883/2004    is    not    suitable    for    evaluating    the    bending
characteristics of fine pitch leadframes or leadframes used for
L-leaded packages because the method is based on reforming
the leads.

5  Summary of Method
5. 1  The leadframe samples (etched using a standard mask agreed between user and supplier) will be formed using a
“W”  forming  tool.  The  resulting  form  angle  is  to  be  measured  and  surface  characteristics  such  as  cracking  and
orange peel are to be visible for compliance to the agreed upon specification.
6  Interference
6. 1  If  the  forming  tool  does  not  meet  the  specification,  lead  movement  during  forming  may  result  in  poor
repeatability.
7  Significance
7. 1  Devices  manufactured  with  leadframes  of  different  spring  back  characteristics  may  cause  board  assembly
problems, due to lead positional differences.
7. 2  Crack in the leadframe may cause poor contact reliability with board.

7. 1  The  sampling  plan  shall  be  in  agreement  between  customer  and  vendor.  It  is  recommended  that  the  following
minimum sample sizes are used:
• Shear Method — Four (4) samples
• Pull Method — Four (4) samples
• Three-Point Bending Method — Three (3) samples in each direction
NOTE 1:  Three-point bending method needs at least 2 samples to obtain adhesive strength.
8  Materials
8. 1  Leadframe or appropriated sample from strip meeting dimensions for test.
8. 2  Molding compound
9  Sample Preparation
9. 1  Leadframe Sample Preparation
9. 1.1  Process  the  leadframe  samples  through  the  various  cleaning  and  heat  cycles  that  would  be  normal  for  the
leadframe under consideration as required.
NOTE 2:  When  this  method  is  applied  to  copper  leadframes,  copper  oxide  on  the  surface  shall  be  considered  when  results  are
interpreted.
9. 2  Clean and condition the molds to provide well formed samples as required.
9. 3  Set the molds to the specified temperature and record the temperature.</p><p>5 SEMI G69-0996 © SEMI 1996, 2004
9. 4  Set the transfer molding pressure, transfer time and
cure   time   to   the   following   recommended   molding
conditions.   If   the   condition   is   not   suitable   for   the

shear may be applied.</p></li><li><p>1.2  Place   the   shear   tool   against   the   molding
compound  formation  and  initiate  a  load  at  a  constant
speed  between  2–10  mm/min  while  recording  the  load
and displacement.</p></li><li><p>1.3  Record the peak load before the sudden drop in
applied  load  as  the  sample  shears  off  the  leadframe  or
the molding compound breaks.
NOTE 5:  Disregard any results which have the appearance of
sample   slipping   or   shear   tool   riding   over   the   molding
compound.</p></li><li><p>2  Pull Method</p></li><li><p>2.1  Attach  the  sample  to  the  tensile  tester  such  that
the   leadframe   may   be   pulled   out   of   the   molding
compound with a vertical pull action.</p></li><li><p>2.2  Attach  the  pulling  grips  to  the  leadframe  and
initiate   a   load   at   a   constant   speed   between   2–10
mm/min. while recording the load and displacement.</p></li><li><p>2.3  Record the peak load before the sudden drop in
applied  load  as  the  sample  is  pulled  from  the  molding
compound samples.
