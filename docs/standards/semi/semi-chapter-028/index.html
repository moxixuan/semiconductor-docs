monitoring  of  selected  equipment  variables  and  has
three primary aspects:
—  Defines  a  standard  set  of  monitoring  zones  and
limits.
—  Provides  for  reporting  to  the  host  when  selected
equipment  variables  transition  between  monitoring
zones.
—  Empowers  the  host  to  modify  the  values  of  the
variable   limit   attributes   for   these   same   selected
equipment variables.</li><li>2.4.1  Purpose  —  The  limits  monitoring  capability
provides  the  host  a  means  of  monitoring  equipment
conditions  by  a  flexible,  efficient,  and  asynchronous
method   which   is   consistent   across   equipment.   It
eliminates  the  need  for  constant  polling  of  equipment
by  the  host  for  current  status  values.  Further,  this
capability  allows  the  host  to  implement  changes  in  the
monitoring   range   as   needed.   This   capability   has
application     to     both     production     operation     and
diagnostic/testing scenarios, and it also has applicability
to statistical process control.</li><li>2.4.2  Definitions
LimitVariable  —  DVVAL  containing  the  VID  of  a
specific equipment variable for which a zone transition
collection event has been generated.
EventLimit  —  DVVAL  containing  the  LIMITID  of  the
limit crossed by LimitVariable.
TransitionType — DVVAL which defines the direction
of the zone transition which has occurred: 0 = transition
from lower to upper zone, 1 = transition from upper to
lower zone.
Limit  —  Used  in  this  section  to  represent  the  set  of
variable   limit   attributes   that   completely   describe   a
variable  monitoring  “barrier.”  The  attributes  include
VID, Units, UPPERDB, LOWERDB, LIMITMAX, and
LIMITMIN.  In  some  contexts  it  may  be  interpreted
more  narrowly  as  the  combination  of  UPPERDB  and
LOWERDB.
LIMITID
n
—  Refers  to  the  identifier  of  a  specific  limit
(as defined by UPPERDB and LOWERDB) among the
set   of   limits   for   a   monitored   equipment   variable.
LIMITIDs  are  consecutively  numbered,  beginning  at
one   through   the   number   of   limits   possible   (seven
minimum).
Monitoring  Zone  —  A  subset  of  the  possible  range  of
values  for  a  variable  of  interest  to  the  host.  A  single
limit  divides  the  range  into  two  zones.  Multiple  limits
may be combined to divide the range even further.
Zone  Transition  —  The  movement  of  a  variable  value
from one monitoring zone to another. This transition is
a collection event and has a corresponding CEID.
Deadband — An overlap of two zones implemented to
prevent  constant  zone  transitions  by  a  variable  sitting
on or near a limit (i.e., “chattering”).
UPPERDB — A variable limit attribute that defines the
upper boundary of the deadband of a limit.
18
The value
applies to a single limit (LIMITID) for a specified VID.</li></ol><p>18 The format and units must be the same as the format of the
variable being monitored.</p><p>SEMI E30-1103 © SEMI 1992, 2003
26
Thus,  UPPERDB  and  LOWERDB  as  a  pair  define  a
limit.
LOWERDB — A variable limit attribute that defines the
lower boundary of the deadband of a limit.
18
The value
applies to a single limit (LIMITID) for a specified VID.
Thus,  UPPERDB  and  LOWERDB  as  a  pair  define  a
limit.
UPPER  ZONE  —  The  range  of  values  lying  above  a
limit.
LOWERZONE  —  The  range  of  values  lying  below  a
limit.
LIMITMAX  —  The  maximum  value  for  any  limits  of  a
specific  equipment  variable.  This  value  is  set  by  the
equipment  manufacturer  and  typically  coincides  with
the maximum value allowed for the monitored variable.
LIMITMIN  —  The  minimum  value  for  any  limits  of  a
specific  equipment  variable.
19
This  value  is  set  by  the
equipment  manufacturer  and  typically  coincides  with
the minimum value allowed for the monitored variable.
Undefined — When used in reference to variable limits,
it indicates that monitoring/reporting of zone transitions
involving that particular limit are disabled.
4. 2.4.3  Description — The limits monitoring capability
provides    the    host    with    a    minimum    of    seven
configurable  limits  or  barriers  that  may  be  applied  to
selected  equipment  status  variables  (SV’s)  of  the  types
floating point, integer, and boolean. When one of these
barriers  is  crossed,  a  collection  event  is  generated  to
alert the host to a change in monitoring zone or state of
the  monitored  variable.  These  seven  limits  may  be
combined in a variety of ways to match the needs of the
host  system.
19
An illustration of a combination of five
of the limits to provide one type of variable monitoring
is  shown  in  Figure  4.2.1.
20
This  section  describes  the
key      aspects      of      limits      monitoring.      Detailed
implementation   examples   of   limits   monitoring   are
provided as Application Note A.7.
NOTE 6: While the SEMI E5 standard allows SV’s to be lists,
such variable lists are not allowed under this capability.
4. 2.4.3.1  Monitoring  Limit  Characteristics  —  A  limit
is defined by a set of attributes that include the variable
(VID)  to  which  the  limit  corresponds,  the  units  of  that
variable, the maximum and minimum possible values of</p><p>19 Note that while at least seven limits per variable are available from
the equipment, the host need not use all seven.
20 This illustration shows the reading which might be available to the
equipment, not the limit excursions reported to the host. Reporting is
covered later in the section.
the   limit   (LIMITMAX   and   LIMITMIN)   and   the
specific    borders    of    the    limit    (UPPERDB    and
LOWERDB). See Figure 4.2.2. There is a limitation to
the  values  of  UPPERDB  and  LOWERDB  which  may
be stated as:
LIMITMAX≥UPPERDB≥LOWERDB≥LIMITMIN
A  limit  divides  the  possible  range  of  variable  values
into  two  parts,  the  upper  zone  and  the  lower  zone.  At
any  time,  the  monitored  variable  is  considered  to  be  in
one  and  only  one  of  these  zones.  However,  as  Figure
4. 2.2  shows,  these  two  zones  have  an  area  of  overlap.
This is called the deadband.</p><p>Figure 4.2.1
Limit Combination Illustration: Control
Application</p><p>Figure 4.2.2
Elements of One Limit</p><p>The  deadband  is  a  key  concept  of  limits  monitoring,
especially  for  floating  point  variables.  Its  purpose  is  to
prevent  a  phenomenon  known  as  chattering  —  the
repeated   changing   of   zones   due   to   small,   rapid
fluctuations   in   variable   value   while   near   the   zone
boundary.  In  practice,  the  value  of  a  variable  must
reach  the  opposite  boundary  of  the  deadband  before  a
zone  transition  can  occur.  Thus,  if  a  variable’s  value</p><p>SEMI E30-1103 © SEMI 1992, 2003
27
reaches  the  UPPERDB  and  transitions  into  the  upper
zone,  it  will  not  return  to  the  lower  zone  until  it  falls
back   to   the   LOWERDB.   The   difference   between
UPPERDB  and  LOWERDB  should  always  be  greater
than the typical amplitude of those fluctuations deemed
to  be  insignificant.  In  some  cases,  the  width  of  the
deadband    may    set    to    zero    (i.e.,    UPPERDB    =
LOWERDB). At first glance, this would seem to make
indeterminate  the  current  zone  when  an  integer  value
sits  on  the  limit.  This  is  not  the  case,  however,  when
movement  of  the  value  is  considered.  To  illustrate,  an
example    is    given,    assuming    that    UPPERDB    =
LOWERDB = 100. The list shows consecutive readings
of the variable and the resultant zone:
99  Lower Zone (Initial Reading)
101  Upper Zone (Zone Transition)
100  Lower Zone (Zone Transition)
100  Lower Zone
99  Lower Zone
100  Upper Zone (Zone Transition)
Transition  from  one  zone  into  another  generates  a
collection  event,  as  might  be  reported  via  S6,F11.  The
host has the option of receiving notification by enabling
event reporting for the event. For each variable that has
monitoring capability, one CEID is reserved to indicate
zone   transitions   for   that   variable.   To   aid   in   the
determination  of  the  nature  of  a  transition  event,  three
DVVAL’s have been defined:
LimitVariable — The VID of the monitored variable to
which the collection event refers.
EventLimit   —   Contains   the   LIMITID   of   the   limit
reached or crossed by LimitVariable.
TransitionType  —  Defines  the  direction  of  the  zone
transition which has occurred: 0 = transition from lower
to upper zone, 1 = transition from upper to lower zone.
Sampling  frequency  is  an  important  element  of  limits
monitoring and should be considered during equipment
specification. If changes in variable value are relatively
fast  compared  to  sampling  frequency,  it  is  possible  for
some zone transitions to be missed or for multiple zone
transitions   to   occur   between   readings.   Since   it   is
possible  for  zone  transitions  to  occur  “simultaneously”
or  for  limits  to  be  identically  defined,  the  DVVAL
EventLimit  has  been  defined  to  allow  for  a  list  of
multiple  zone  transitions  of  a  variable  to  be  reported
with a single collection event.
It also should be emphasized that a single CEID is used
to  report  transitions  in  both  directions  across  a  limit.
Thus,  reporting  for  one  direction  but  not  the  other
cannot be configured.
The functionality of each limit for each variable can be
described  with  the  state  model  shown  in  Figure  4.2.3.
Below,   the   three   states   are   described   more   fully,
followed by a table defining the transitions.</p><p>Figure 4.2.3
Limit State Model</p><p>ABOVE LIMIT
A  variable  is  considered  to  be  above  a  limit  when  its
value  increases  to  equal  or  exceed  the  upper  boundary
of the deadband, UPPERDB. The significance attached
to this state is a function of the host’s usage.
BELOW LIMIT
A  variable  is  considered  to  be  below  a  limit  when  its
value   decreases   to   equal   or   fall   below   the   lower
boundary     of     the     deadband,     LOWERDB.     The
significance  attached  to  this  state  is  a  function  of  the
host’s usage.
NO ZONE
In  some  circumstances  it  is  possible  for  the  variable
value  to  be  in  neither  the  upper  zone  nor  the  lower
zone. This may occur upon definition of a new limit or
upon  equipment  startup  when  the  value  of  the  variable
lies in the deadband. In this case, the active state of the
limit  is  considered  to  be  NO  ZONE.  The  limit  shall
remain  in  this  state  until  the  variable  value  reaches
either boundary of the deadband.</p><p>SEMI E30-1103 © SEMI 1992, 2003

4. 2.4.3.2   Modification  of  Limit  Values  —  Values  for
the monitoring limits on any monitored variable may be
modified  by  the  host  using  the  message  transaction
S2,F45/F46  (Define  Variable  Limit  Attributes).  The
equipment   must   reject   any   S2,F45   message   which
contains  limit  information  which  conflicts  with  the
following rules:
—   LIMITMAX≥UPPERDB≥LOWERDB≥LIMIT-
MIN;
—   If  either  UPPERDB  or  LOWERDB  is  defined,
both   must   be   defined;   if   either   UPPERDB   or
LOWERDB is undefined, both must be undefined.
The  first  rule  is  defined  and  graphically  depicted  in
Figure 4.2.2. The second rule refers to the host’s ability
to  turn  any  limit  “on”  or  “off”.  While  a  minimum  of
seven  limits  must  be  available  for  each  monitored
variable,  it  will  be  common  for  the  host  application  to
require  less  than  seven  or  even  none  of  the  limits  be
used. The limits not needed can be disabled by leaving
the     values     for     UPPERDB     and     LOWERDB
“undefined”.  Limits  may  be  disabled  for  a  VID  or  for
all  monitored  VIDs  by  using  zero  length  lists  in  the
S2,F45 message.
All  monitored  variables  must  be  one  of  three  types:
integer,   floating   point,   or   Boolean.   This   may   be
accomplished  by  using  the  following  formats:  11,  20,
3(), 4(), 5().
NOTE  7:  The  binary  format  is  not  allowed.  If  the  ASCII
format is used, the equipment shall perform a conversion into
one   of   the   numeric   types   before   performing   any   value
comparisons, both for limit validations and zone transitions.
4. 2.4.3.3  Limit   Values   Request   —   The   host   may
request  the  current  limit  values  for  a  specified  VID
using  the  message  transaction  S2,F47/F48  (Variable
Limit Attribute Request).
4. 2.4.4  Requirements
—  A  minimum  of  seven  limits  per  monitored  variable
must be available.
—  One CEID per monitored variable must be supplied
for zone transition reporting.
—  All  limit  definitions  must  be  kept  in  non-volatile
storage.
—  The  equipment  must  enforce  the  limit  validation
rules defined above.
—   The   specification   and   documentation   of   which
variables  may  be  monitored  with  this  capability  is
the  responsibility  of  the  equipment  manufacturer
based  on  the  specific  instance  of  equipment.  This
subject also may be addressed by equipment models
of classes of semiconductor equipment.

4. 3  Alarm  Management  —  The  alarm  management
capability     provides     for     host     notification     and
management   of   alarm   conditions   occurring   on   the
equipment.
4. 3.1  Purpose  —  Historically,  a  precise  definition  of
an  equipment  alarm  has  been  absent.  Consequently,
differing  interpretations  have  resulted  in  inconsistent
implementations. This is addressed by providing a more
rigorous   definition   (see   definition   in   Section   4.3.2
below) of an alarm.
In addition, it is often important for equipment to report
more  extensive  information  to  the  host  than  has  been
available    in    the    S5,F1/F2    (Alarm    Report    Send/
Acknowledge)  transaction.  The  data  required  in  such
cases   is   very   dependent   on   equipment   type,   host
information  requirements,  and  alarm  situation.  This
issue   is   addressed   by   providing   event   reporting
methods that are tied to alarm state changes.
Lastly,   the   alarm   management   capability   provides
mechanisms for:
—  Reporting the time of an alarm state change,
—  Uploading a list of alarm texts,
—  Enabling  and  disabling  the  notification  of  specific
alarms, and
—  Host  query  of  alarms  set  and  enabled  status  on  the
equipment.
4. 3.2  Definitions
Alarm — An alarm is related to any abnormal situation
on the equipment that may endanger people, equipment,
or  material  being  processed.  Such  abnormal  situations
are  defined  by  the  equipment  manufacturer  based  on
physical    safety    limitations.    Equipment    activities
potentially  impacted  by  the  presence  of  an  alarm  shall
be inhibited.
Note   that   exceeding   control   limits   associated   with
process  tolerance  does  not  constitute  an  alarm  nor  do
normal    equipment    events    such    as    the    start    or
completion of processing.
AlarmsEnabled  —  Status  value  consisting  of  a  list  of
the  alarm  ID’s  currently  enabled  for  reporting  to  the
host. See SEMI E5 for a full definition of this variable
data item.
AlarmsSet  —  Status  value  consisting  of  a  list  of  the
alarm  ID’s  currently  in  the  ALARM  SET  (or  unsafe)
state. See SEMI E5 for a full definition of this variable
data item.
ALCD  —  Alarm  code  data  item  used  in  the  S5,F1
(Alarm  Report  Send)  and  S5,F6  (List  Alarm  Data)
messages. This code is divided into two parts, the alarm
set/cleared  bit  and  the  7  bit  alarm  category  code.  Only
the set/cleared bit is used—bit 8 = 1 means alarm set, =
0  means  alarm  cleared.  The  alarm  category  code  is  not
used.  See  SEMI  E5  for  a  full  definition  of  this  data
item.
ALID  —  Alarm  identifier.  See  SEMI  E5  for  a  full
definition of this data item.
ALTX  —  Data  item  contained  in  the  S5,F1  and  S5,F6
messages  containing  a  brief  textual  description  of  an
alarm.  See  SEMI  E5  for  a  full  definition  of  this  data
item.</p><p>Figure 4.3
State Diagram for Alarm ALID
n</p><ol start="4"><li>3.3  Detailed  Description  —  Two  alarm  notification
mechanisms   are   defined   to   achieve   the   flexibility
necessary  for  the  reporting  required  by  host  systems.
First,  stream  5  alarm  reporting  enables  a  brief,  yet
fixed,  method  for  notification  of  alarm  occurrences
using  the  S5,F1/F2  transaction.  Second,  to  address  the
host’s  potential  need  for  more  extensive  and  flexible
data  reporting,  two  collection  events  (“alarm  set”  and
“alarm  cleared”)  are  defined  for  each  possible  alarm
condition  on  the  equipment  to  allow  the  use  of  event
data  collection  mechanisms.  In  the  latter  case,  reports
are  sent  by  the  equipment  using  the  Event  Report/
Acknowledge transaction (see Section 4.2 on event data
collection).
The  alarm
n
detected  and  cleared  events  are  derived
from  the  state  model  for  an  alarm  (see  Figure  4.3  and
Table  4.3.1).  In  this  model  each  of  n  alarms  can  be  in
one  of  two  possible  states,  either  ALARM  CLEAR  or
ALARM   SET.   The   transition   from   the   ALARM
CLEAR  to  the  ALARM  SET  state  is  defined  as  the
collection   event   “Alarm
n
detected”   (transition   1).
Conversely,   the   transition   from   ALARM   SET   to
ALARM  CLEAR  is  defined  as  the  collection  event
“Alarm
n
cleared” (transition 2).
NOTE  8:  The  alarm  capability  is  intended  as  an  addition  to
standard  safety  alarms  (e.g.,  lights,  horns).  There  is  no  intent
to replace direct operator notification of such problems, nor is
there  the  expectation  that  the  host  can  prevent  or  directly
address such alarms.</li></ol><p>SEMI E30-1103 © SEMI 1992, 2003

The equipment manufacturer is responsible for identifying all alarms on their equipment by:
—  Applying the above alarm definition,
—  Consulting Application Note A.3 for examples of alarms for various equipment configurations,
—  Noting  that  the  presence  of  an  alarm  typically  requires  some  action  or  intervention  before  resuming  safe
operation of the equipment, and by
—  Referring to Table 4.3.2 below which delineates the differences between events and alarms.</p><p>Table 4.3.2
EVENT                                                                                              ALARM
Any occurrence detectable by the equipment. Related   to   only   those   occurrences   that   are   abnormal,
undesirable,  AND  endanger  people,  equipment,  or  physical
material being processed.
Certain events may trigger a state transition(s). Each alarm  has  an  associated  two-state  state  model:  ALARM
SET (or unsafe) and
ALARM CLEAR (or safe).
Equipment   activities   are   not   necessarily   inhibited   by   the
occurrence of an event (unless it is associated with an alarm or
intentional inhibit).
The  presence  of  an  alarm  inhibits  equipment  activities  to
ensure safe operation until the alarm condition is cleared.
Certain events may occur in an expected sequence. Alarms may occur at any time.</p><ol start="4"><li>3.3.1 Enable/Disable  Alarms  —  Upon  request  from
the host, the equipment shall enable or disable reporting
of  certain  alarms.  Enabling  or  disabling  a  given  alarm
shall  impact  the  communication  of  both  the  alarm  set
and  clear  messages  equally  (i.e.,  turn  them  both  on  or
both off). This is not the case for enabling/disabling of
the  associated  collection  events,  where  the  alarm-set
and  alarm-cleared  events  can  be  enabled  and  disabled
separately.  The  current  enable/disable  settings  must  be
stored    in    non-volatile    memory.    Changes    to    the
enable/disable    settings    must    be    reflected    in    the
AlarmsEnabled status value.
NOTE  9:  The  alarm  itself  is  not  being  enabled  or  disabled,
but  the  reporting  of  the  alarm  through  SECS-II  messages  is
being enabled or disabled.</li><li>3.3.2  Send Alarm Report — Upon detecting a change
in the status of a given alarm, an associated alarm state
model  shall  transition  to  the  opposite  state.  Following
initiation of local actions necessary to ensure safety, the
equipment  must  update  the  AlarmsSet  and  associated
ALCD  values  and  send  an  alarm  message  and/or  an
event  message  to  the  host  assuming  one  or  both  are
enabled.   Alarm   messages   must   be   sent   before   the
corresponding event messages if both are enabled.
NOTE  10:  The  ALCD  is  divided  into  two  parts,  the  alarm
set/cleared  bit  and  the  7  bit  alarm  category  code.  Only  the
set/cleared bit is used—bit 8 = 1 means alarm set, = 0 means
alarm cleared. The alarm category code is not used.</li><li>3.3.3  List Alarm Text — Upon request from the host,

with  a  specified  list  of  alarm  ID’s  using  the  S5,F5/F6
(List Alarms Request/Data) transaction.
4. 3.3.4   List  Currently  Set  Alarms  —  The  host  may
obtain  a  listing  of  currently  set  alarms  by  employing
any  data  collection  method  specified  by  GEM  and
referencing  the  variable  data  item  called  “AlarmsSet”
(e.g.,  including  &quot;  AlarmsSet  in  a  report  definition).
When  reported,  AlarmsSet  must  contain  a  list  of  all
currently set alarms. Each alarm set or clear occurrence
must cause a change to the AlarmsSet status value prior
to reporting it to the host.
4. 3.3.5   List  Currently  Enabled  Alarms  —  The  host
may  obtain  a  listing  of  currently  enabled  alarms  by
employing  any  data  collection  method  specified  by
GEM  and  referencing  the  variable  data  item  called
“AlarmsEnabled”  (e.g.,  including  AlarmsEnabled  in  a
report definition). When reported, AlarmsEnabled must
contain  a  list  of  all  alarm  ID’s  currently  enabled  for
reporting.  The  equipment  must  update  the  value  of
AlarmsEnabled  upon  corresponding  change(s)  to  the
enable/disable settings.
4. 3.4  Requirements
—  A set of alarms relating to the physical safety limits
of operator, equipment, or material being processed
must be defined for the equipment by the equipment
manufacturer.
—   The   equipment   must   maintain   all   enable/disable
states    and    report    definitions    for    alarms    and
collection events in non-volatile memory.
—  Each  alarm  defined  on  the  equipment  must  have  a
brief   description   of   its   meaning,   an   associated
unique alarm identifier (ALID), alarm text (ALTX),
an  alarm  status  (ALCD)  and  two  unique  collection
event  identifiers  (CEIDs),  one  for  set  and  one  for
cleared.
—   Enabled   alarm   reports   must   be   sent   prior   to
corresponding enabled event reports.</p><ol start="4"><li>3.5  Scenarios

4. 4   Remote Control
4. 4.1  Purpose — This capability provides the host with
a level of control over equipment operations.
4. 4.2  Definitions
Host          Command          Parameter          (CPNAME/
CPVAL/CEPVAL)     —     A     parameter     name/value
associated     with     a     particular     host     command
(S2,F41/S2,F49).   The   equipment   manufacturer   must
provide  unique  names  (CPNAMEs)  for  any  supported
command  parameters.  Command  parameters  are  not
specified  in  this  document  but  are  left  to  equipment
manufacturers  to  define.  Equipment  models  of  specific
classes  of  semiconductor  equipment  also  may  address
this   issue.   Note   that   if   there   are   no   associated
parameters  a  zero-length  list  is  sent.  The  data  item
CEPVAL,   which   can   be   defined   as   a   list,   allows
grouping    of    related    parameters    within    a    main
parameter.  If  the  CEPVAL  is  defined  as  a  single  (non-
list) item, then it is the equivalent of a CPVAL.
The  uses  of  OBJSPEC  in  the  header  structure  of  the
S2,F49    Enhanced    Remote    Command    allows    the
equipment supplier to define a set of unique identifiers
for  different  objects  within  the  equipment  such  as:
equipment     sub-systems,     sub-system     components,
processing stations, ports, and exchange stations.
4. 4.3  Description  —  The  equipment  responds  to  host
commands that provide the following functions relative
to individual equipment implementations:
—  Start  processing
—  Select a process program or recipe
—  Stop  processing
—  Temporarily suspend processing
—  Resume  processing
—  Abort  processing
Additional   commands   may   be   implemented   by   the
equipment   manufacturer   (e.g.,   vent   chamber,   clear
material, open door).
Remote  commands  shall  be  interpreted  as  “request
action   be   initiated”   rather   than   “do   action.”   The
equipment  may  then  respond  via  S2,F42/S2,F50  with
HCACK   =   4   if   the   command   “is   going   to   be
performed.”    This  alleviates  any  transaction  timeouts
for  commands  that  may  take  a  long  time  to  perform.
The  completion  of  the  action  initiated  by  the  remote
command (i.e., HCACK = 0 or 4) must result in either a
state   transition   or   other   action   that   generates   a
collection event upon normal/abnormal completion.
The  format  for  all  remote  commands  is  ASCII,  with  a
maximum  length  of  20  characters.  The  character  set  is
restricted  to  the  printable  characters  (hexadecimal  21
through 7E). Note that spaces are not allowed.
The    following    remote    commands    (RCMDs),    if
implemented  on  the  equipment,  shall  be  supported  as
described  below  (see  Section  3.4  for  a  description  of
Equipment Processing States).
NOTE  12:  The  terms  “current  cycle”  and  “safe  break  point”
used  below  are  to  be  defined  by  the  supplier  or  within  the
models of classes of semiconductor equipment.
START — This command is available to the host when
a  process  program  or  recipe  has  been  selected  and  the
equipment   is   in   the   “ready”   processing   state.   The
START  command  instructs  the  equipment  to  initiate
processing.      Variable   parameter   settings   may   be
included     as     name/value     command     parameters
CPNAME/CPVAL/CEPVAL.
PP-SELECT — This command instructs the equipment
to  make  the  requested  process  program(s)  available  in
the  execution  area.  The  process  programs  (PPIDs)  are
specified  via  the  command  parameter  list.  A  status
variable   (PPExecName)   contains   the   PPID   of   the
process program(s) currently selected.
RCP-SELECT  —  This  command    uses  the  Enhanced
Remote  Command  S2,F49  to  instruct  the  equipment  to
prepare   the   requested   recipes   for   execution   in   the
execution  area.  The  recipes  and  variable  parameters  are
specified    via  command  parameter  lists.      Each  recipe
specification  may  be  accompanied  by  new  variable
parameter  settings,  if  any,  in  the  command  parameter
list.    A  status  variable  RcpExecName  contains  the
recipe  specifiers  or  identifiers  of  the  recipes  currently
selected.
STOP — Command to complete the current cycle, stop
in  a  safe  condition  and  return  to  the  “idle”  processing
state.  Stop  has  the  intent  of  stopping  the  process.  The
equipment is not required to support the continuation of
processing.  Stop  leaves  material  either  fully  processed
or partially processed so that the processing can be later
completed.  For  example,  for  a  single  wafer  process
tool,   five   wafers   have   been   processed   while   the
remaining wafers remain unprocessed.
PAUSE —     Command     to     suspend     processing
temporarily  at  the  next  safe  break  point.  Pause  has  the
intent  of  resuming  the  process  at  the  same  point  where
it   was   paused.   The   process   may   be   RESUMED,
STOPPED,   or   ABORTED   while   in   a   PAUSED
condition.   RESUME   shall   be   able   to   continue   the
process from the same point where it was paused.</p><p>SEMI E30-1103 © SEMI 1992, 2003
35
RESUME  —  Command  to  resume  processing  from  the
point where the process was paused.
ABORT —  Command  to  terminate  the  current  cycle
prior   to   its   completion.   Abort   has   the   intent   of
immediately  stopping  the  process  and  is  used  because
of  abnormal  conditions.  Abort  makes  no  guarantee
about   the   subsequent   condition   of   material.   In   the
above  example,  the  wafers  being  processed  at  the  time
of  the  abort  may  not  be  completely  processed.  Other
AbortLevels &gt; 1 may be defined by the manufacturer or
addressed     by     models     of     specific     classes     of
semiconductor equipment.
CPNAME = AbortLevel, CPVAL = 1 means terminate
current cycle at the next “safe break point,” retrieve all
material,  stop  in  a  safe  condition  and  return  to  the  idle
state in the processing state machine.
4. 4.4  Requirements
—  The following Remote Commands, as defined under
Descriptions, must be implemented on equipment to
satisfy minimum requirements for this capability:
—  START
—  STOP
—  The  RCMD  value  for  all  commands  supported  on
the  equipment  must  be  recognized  if  sent  with  all
upper-case   characters   (e.g.,   “STOP”,   “START”,
“PP-SELECT”,   “PAUSE”,   etc.).   In   addition   to
accepting  strings  with  all  upper-case characters, the
equipment  can  optionally  accept  strings  with  all
lower-case  characters  or  mixed-case  strings.  The
equipment  documentation  should  describe  whether
or not the optional lower-case or mixed-case strings
are supported.
—  Stream  2  currently  provides  for  Host  Command
Send    and    Enhanced    Remote    Command.    The
equipment shall support one or both methods, based
on appropriateness.
—  The Enhanced Remote Command is used to address
size, complexity, or the need to target a specific sub-
system   within   the   equipment,   (i.e.,   processing
station,  port,  exchange  station,  material  handler,
chamber).</p><ol start="4"><li>4.5  Scenarios</li><li>4.5.1  Host Command Send Scenario

Process  Program  —  A  process  program  is  the  pre-
planned  and  reusable  portion  of  the  set  of  instructions,
settings, and parameters under control of the equipment
that  determine  the  processing  environment  seen  by  the
manufactured object and that may be subject to change
between runs or processing cycles.
Process  Program  Identifier  —  A  text  string  (PPID)
used to identify a process program.
Formatted Process Program — A process program that
is presented as an ordered sequence of command codes
with  their  associated  parameters as dictated by S7,F23,
and  S7,F26.  Where  formatted  process  programs  are
supported,  equipment  must  also  provide  information
sufficient  to  allow  a  user  at  the  host  to  create,  display,
modify, and partially verify their contents (for example,
that information provided in S7,F22).
Unformatted   Process   Program   —   An   unformatted
process  program  is  transferred  without  structure  as  the
single  data  item  PPBODY  (refer  to  SEMI  E5  for  a
complete description of PPBODY).
Process   Program   Change   Event   —   The   collection
event  associated  with  the  occurrence  of  the  creation,
modification,  or  deletion  of  a  process  program  by  the
operator.
PPChangeName — A data value (DVVAL) containing
the  PPID  of  the  process  program  affected  by  the  event
Process Program Change Event. See SEMI E5 for a full
definition of this variable data item.
PPChangeStatus  —  The  action  taken  on  the  process
program  named  by  PPChangeName.  This  variable  is
valid  for  the  collection  event  Process  Program  Change
Event. See SEMI E5 for a full definition of this variable
data item.</li></ol><p>SEMI E30-1103 © SEMI 1992, 2003
38
PPExecName  —  The  status  variable  containing  the
PPID(s)  of  the  currently  selected  process  program(s).
See  SEMI  E5  for  a  full  definition  of  this  variable  data
item.
PP-SELECT  —  The  remote  command  used  to  select
one   or   more   process   programs   for   execution.   The
process   programs   are   specified   by   PPID   via   the
command parameter list.
Process Program Verification — Verification is syntax
checking  of  a  process  program.  Verification  ensures
only  that  a  process  program  is  structured  correctly.  It
does   not   ensure   that   the   program   has   the   correct
parameters  to  run  a  particular  process  or  product  (see
Process  Program  Validation).    Equipment  supporting
unformatted    process    programs    should    provide    a
variable  DVVAL  PPError  that  provides  information  to
the user concerning the error or errors when an attempt
to verify a process program fails.
NOTE 14: It may not be possible for the equipment to verify
unformatted process programs other than to check the size of
the program and internal program checksums. Equipment has
no standard means of indicating the type of error encountered
in an unformatted process program.
Process Program Validation — Validation is type-and-
range checking of parameters in a process program, and
is performed after verification.
4. 6.2.2  Definitions for Recipes
Execution  recipe  —  A  type  of  recipe  stored  by  the
equipment  for  purposes  of  editing,  verification,  and
execution.
For  complete  definitions  of  execution  recipes  and  their
standard attributes, see SEMI E42, Section 6.
Execution  Recipe  Change  Event  — The  collection  event
associated  with  the  occurrence  of  the    modification  or
deletion of an execution  recipe stored by the equipment.
Note 15: A recipe is modified whenever its body is changed.
New  Execution  Recipe  Event  — The  collection  event
associated with the creation of a new execution recipe at
the equipment.
Object   form   recipe   —   A   recipe   with   body   in   a
proprietary   format   that   may   be   presented   without
structure.
RcpChangeName —  A  data  value  (DVVAL)  containing
the   identifier   of   the   recipe   affected   by   the   event
Execution   Recipe   Change   Event   or   New   Execution
Recipe  Event.    See  the  SEMI  E5  Standard  for  a  full
definition of this variable data item.
RcpChangeStatus —  The  action  taken  on  the  recipe
named by RcpChangeName. This variable is valid for the
collection event Execution Recipe Change Event or New
Execution Recipe Event.  See the SEMI E5 Standard for
a full definition of this variable data item.
RcpExecName — The  status  variable  containing  the
specifiers  of  the  currently  selected  recipe(s).    See  the
SEMI  E5  Standard  for  a  full  definition  of  this  variable
data item.
RCP-SELECT —  The  remote  command  used  to  select
one or more recipes for execution.  See Section 4.4.3.
Recipe  Attribute  —  Information  about  the  recipe  that  is
transferred  with  the  recipe  as  a  name/value  pair.    The
value may be a single item or a list.
Recipe  —  A  recipe  contains  both  a  set  of  instructions,
settings,  and  parameters  that  the  equipment  uses  to
determine   the   processing   environment   (its   body   or
process  program)  and  a  set  of  attributes  that  provide
information about the recipe, such as the date and time
the body was last changed.
SEMI  E42  defines  two  types  of  recipes:  managed
recipes  and  execution  recipes.  For  purposes  of  GEM,
the term recipe refers to an execution recipe only.
Recipe  identifier  —  A  recipe  identifier  is  a  formatted
text string (RCPID) used to identify the recipe.
Recipe specifier — A formatted text string (RCPSPEC)
used in messages to indicate a specific recipe.  A recipe
specifier  includes  the  recipe  identifier.    It  may  also
include additional information, such as the name of the
specific  component  of  the  equipment  where  the  recipe
is to be executed (e.g. a process chamber) and the name
of a recipe repository on the host.
Recipe Verification — Verification is syntax checking of
a recipe’s body. Verification ensures that a recipe body is
structured  correctly  and  has  the  correct  syntax.    It  may
also  provide  a  check  of  semantics.      It  does  not  ensure
that   the   body   has   the   correct   parameters   to   run   a
particular process or product (see Recipe Validation).
NOTE 16: Unverified recipes shall be verified upon download.
Recipe   Validation   —   Validation   is   type-and-range
checking  of  parameters  in  a  recipe,  and  is  performed
when  the  recipe  is  selected  for  execution.    The  recipe
may be correct in its syntax and semantics but should fail
validation  if  it  can  not  be  executed  with  the  current
equipment configuration.
Source  form  recipe  — A    recipe  with  a  body  that  is
presented as an ordered sequence of text.  A source form
recipe   may   be   created   and   edited   off-line   to   the
equipment.    Definition  of  syntax  requirements  shall  be
documented, in order to allow proper off-line editing.</p><p>SEMI E30-1103 © SEMI 1992, 2003
39
Variable  Parameters  —  Variable  parameters  are  recipe
parameters that are defined in the body of the recipe and
whose  run-time  values  may  be  set  outside  of  the  recipe
when  the  recipe  is  selected  for  execution  and/or  when
processing is started.   Both the host and the operator may
specify new settings as a parameter name/value pair.
Variable Parameter Definition — A variable parameter
definition  has  three  parts:  the  name  of  the  variable
parameter,  its  default  setting,  and  restrictions  on  the
run-time value selected.  Variable parameter definitions
are stored in the recipe attribute “Parameters”.
4. 6.3  Description
4. 6.3.1 Process Program Description
Process   programs   allow   the   equipment’s   process,
and/or  the  parameters  used  by  that  process,  to  be  set
and   modified   by   the   engineer   to   achieve   different
results.  Different  process  programs  maybe  required  for
different   products,   while   often   the   same   process
program will be used for all lots of a given product. The
engineer  must  be  able  to  create  such  programs,  to
modify  current  programs,  and  to  delete  programs  from
equipment storage.
For the host to ensure that the proper process programs
are in place at the equipment, there must be a means of
transferring them from equipment to host and from host
to equipment. The host also may need to delete process
programs  from  the  equipment’s  storage  to  make  room
for  a  process  program  to  be  downloaded.  In  addition,
the   host   must   be   kept   informed   whenever   a   local
change  occurs  in  the  contents  or  status  of  a  process
program.
Both formatted and unformatted process programs may
be  uploaded  and  downloaded.  This  capability  provides
for  both  host-  and  equipment-initiated  transfers.  The
equipment-initiated  transfer  may  be  used  at  the  request
of the process engineer or operator at the equipment.
If  a  process  program  exists  with  the  same  PPID  as  the
one  given  in  the  SECS-II  message,  the  old  process
program  must  be  replaced.  The  PPID  in  the  e  process
program in non-volatile storage.
4. 6.3.2 Recipe Description
Specifications  in  Section  4.6.3.1  apply  to  recipes  as
well    as    process    programs,    with    the    following
differences:
• A   recipe   contains   a   body   corresponding   to   a
process program.  In addition, it contains attributes
defined   for   execution   recipes   in   SEMI   E42,
Section   6.      Recipe   attributes   are   transferred
whenever the recipe is downloaded or uploaded.
• The   same   SECS-II   messages   are   used   for   all
execution    recipes,    regardless    of    the    internal
structure of the recipe body.
• If an execution recipe already exists with the same
identifier as the one given in the SECS-II message,
the   downloaded   recipe   shall   be   rejected   (not
stored)  unless  the  host  has  specified  a  “forced
overwrite”  in the data  item RCPOWCODE.
• A  recipe  currently  being  edited  shall  be  protected
from inadvertent change or overwriting by a recipe
with  the  same  identifier  that  is  downloaded  during
this  time.    If  the  downloaded  recipe  is  accepted
(stored),  the  equipment  shall  require  the  operator
either  to  save  the  edited  recipe  to  a  new  (unused)
identifier or to discard it.
• For  the  equipment  to  initiate  either  an  upload  or
download  of  a  recipe,  it  shall  request  the  host  to
initiate  an  upload  or  download  procedure.    In
addition,  it  may  be  necessary  to  also  specify  the
name  of  the  repository  (recipe  namespace)  at  the
host.
4. 6.3.3 Large Process Programs and Recipes
4. 6.3.3.1 Process programs and recipes for certain types
of    equipment,    such    as    metrology    or    inspection
equipment,  contain  images  and  are,  therefore,  very
large. Such process programs and recipes cannot fit into
a   single   multi-block   SECS-II   message   that   has   a
maximum   theoretical   size   of   7,995,148   text   bytes.
Furthermore,  process  programs  and  recipes  may  also
require some preparation prior to transfer.
4. 6.3.3.2  The  commonly  used  Stream  7  and  Stream  15
transfer   functions   require   that   the   entire   process
program  be  sent  in  a  single  message.  Thus,  it  is  not
possible to send a large process program or recipe with
such  messages.  However,  there  is  an  alternative  set  of
Stream  7  and  Stream  15  functions  that  supports  large
transfers.  These  messages  invoke  Stream  13  Data  Set
Transfer  Protocol  messages  to  transfer  large  process
programs  (or  recipes)  by  using  a  sequence  of  read
messages. The completion of such a read transaction is
indicated  by  “ERROR:  End  of  Data”.  The  Data  Set
Transfer  Protocol  does  not  set  any  limit  on  the  size  of
the data set.</p><ol start="4"><li>6.4  Requirements
• The equipment manufacturer shall provide a method
to  create,  modify,  and  delete    process  programs  or
recipes.      This   method   shall   exist   on   either   the
equipment or on a separate computing system.</li></ol><p>SEMI E30-1103 © SEMI 1992, 2003
40
• A  CEID  shall  be  defined  for  a  collection  event  for
the   creation,   the   deletion,   or   the   modification
(completion  of  an  editing  session)  of  a  process
program   (Process   Program   Change   Event).   For
recipes, there are two separate CEIDs and collection
events,  one  for  the  creation  of  a  new  recipe  (New
Execution  Recipe  Event)  and  one  when  a  recipe  is
changed   or   deleted   (Execution   Recipe   Change
Event).      A  New    Execution  Recipe  Event  shall
occur  whenever  a  new  recipe    identifier  is  created
through download, edit, copy, or rename operations.
A   Execution   Recipe   Change   Event   shall   occur
whenever the body of an existing recipe is modified.
• The  name  (identifier)  that  the  engineer  or  operator
uses  to  refer  to  the  process  program  or  recipe  is  the
same as the identifier used by the host.
• Upon   request   from   the   host   or   operator,   the
equipment  shall  perform  the  following  actions  with
regard  to  process  programs  and  recipes  stored  in
non-volatile  storage:  upload,  download,  delete,  and
list  current  equipment  process  program  or  recipe
directory.
• The  equipment  shall  be  able  to  store  in  non-volatile
memory  the  number  of  process  programs  or  recipes
sufficient  to  execute  three  unique  process  cycles.
For  example,  if  a  wire-bonder  requires  both  an
“ALIGN”  process  program  and  a  “BOND”  process
program for a full process cycle, then it must provide
non-volatile storage for at least three pairs of process
programs.  These  stored  process  programs  or  recipes
may  not  be  modified  in  any  way  by  the  execution
process,  nor  may  the  execution  process  be  affected
by   the   modification   of   any   process   program   or
recipes in storage, either by downloading or by local
editing,  while  that  process  program  or  recipes
is
being executed.
• The   equipment   must   provide   verification   and
validation  of  all  downloaded  process  programs  and
recipes.
• Stream  7  provides  for  formatted  and  unformatted
process  programs,  while  Stream  15  provides  for
recipes.  The equipment must support at least one of
these three methods.
• The    equipment    supplier    shall    document    any
restrictions  on  the  length  or  test  format  of  PPID.
The  maximum  length  allowed  by  equipment  may
be less than that allowed by SECS-II.
• Where   recipes   are   supported,      the   following
requirements also apply:
• The variable PPFormat shall be provided to
indicate to the user the messages supported by
the equipment.
• The recipe and its attributes shall comply to
the requirements for  execution recipes as
defined in SEMI E42, Section 6.</p><ol start="4"><li>6.5  Scenarios for Process Programs</li><li>6.5.1  Process Program Creation, Editing, or Deletion Process Program Created, Edited, or Deleted by Operator

management  of  time-related  activities  and  occurrences
associated   with   the   equipment   and   across   multiple
pieces of equipment.</li><li>10.1  Purpose — The purpose of the clock capability
is to enable time stamping of collection event and alarm
reports.  Time  stamping  is  useful  for  resolving  relative
order  of  event/alarm  occurrences  and  scheduling  of
equipment activities by the host.
The ability for the host to instruct the equipment to set
an  internal  clock  to  a  specified  time  value,  and  for  the
equipment  to  request  the  current  date  and  time,  is
needed     for     effective     time     management     and
synchronization between host and equipment.</li><li>10.2  Definitions
Clock  —  Clock  is  a  status  variable  containing  the
current  value  of  time  at  the  equipment.  Clock  may  be
included  in  report  definitions  and/or  queried  separately
by  the  host.  See  SEMI  E5  for  a  full  definition  of  this
variable data item and its required formatting.
TIME  —  TIME  is  a  data  item  contained  in  messages
used by the host to set time at the equipment and by the
equipment  or  host  to  request  the  current  time  from  the
other.  (See  SEMI  E5  for  a  full  definition  of  this  data
item.)</li><li>10.3  Detailed  Description  —  The  clock  capability
assumes  the  existence  of  a  relative  time  reference  on
the equipment. This time reference is used as a basis for
updating the time value of an equipment status variable
called  “Clock.”  The  time  reference  must  reflect  the
current  time  to  within  a  resolution  range  of  seconds  to
centiseconds (refer to the format for Clock in the SEMI
E5   Standard).   The   purpose   of   time   stamping   with
centiseconds  is  to  resolve  the  order  in  which  nearly
simultaneous events occur rather than to provide a more
precise   record   of   the   time   of   day   at   which   they
occurred.  Where  more  than  one  event  occurs  within  a
given   period   of   clock   resolution,   the   centiseconds
reported in the time stamps for these events must reflect
the  actual  order  in  which  the  events  were  detected.
Equipment with a clock resolution of less than a second
should   report   centiseconds.   Otherwise,   centiseconds
should be assigned to reflect the relative order in which
events were detected. Equipment unable to resolve time
to  less  than  a  second  and  unable  to  reflect  the  relative
order   in   which   events   were   detected   may   report
centiseconds as “00”.</li></ol><p>SEMI E30-1103 © SEMI 1992, 2003
62
The  host  employs  the  “Date  and  Time  Set  Request”
message (S2,F31) to initialize the value of Clock to the
value  contained  in  the  TIME  data  item.  Similarly,  the
equipment  may  employ  the  “Date  and  Time  Request“
message (S2,F17) to obtain a new initialization time for
Clock.  As  before,  the  value  of  TIME  returned  by  the
host  is  used  to  set  Clock.  Note,  in  the  event  that  the
precision  of  TIME  is  seconds  and  that  for  Clock  is
centiseconds,  in  both  cases  the  initial  value  of  Clock
shall   contain   “00”   for   its   Centisecond   digits   upon
initialization. Additionally, for any field in TIME that is
not  supported  by  the  equipment,  the  local  value  of  this
field  is  equipment  dependent.  For  example,  Equipment
that  cannot  resolve  time  to  less  than  a  second  might
round   or   ignore   centiseconds   and   always   set   the
Centisecond field to “00”.
4. 10.4  Requirements

4. 11  Spooling  —  Spooling  is  a  capability  whereby  the
equipment  can  queue  messages  intended  for  the  host
during     times     of     communication     failure     and
subsequently      deliver      these      messages      when
communication   is   restored.   Spooling   is   limited   to
primary messages of user-selected streams.
4. 11.1  Purpose   —   The   purpose   of   spooling   is   to
provide a method for retaining equipment message data
that  might  otherwise  be  lost  due  to  communication
failure. The motive for producing this functionality is to
retain   valuable   data   used   to   track   material   and   to
improve product quality. The spooling capability fills a
gap  in  the  SEMI  E5  standard.  In  the  past,  without  a
spooling    capability,    the    equipment    has    typically
discarded  messages  that  could  not  be  delivered,  or
turned  messaging  off  altogether.  It  is  intended  that  the
host   initiate   the   spool   unload   process   immediately
following the reestablishment of communications.
4. 11.2  Definitions
MaxSpoolTransmit     —     An     equipment     constant
containing  the  maximum  number  of  messages  that  the
equipment  shall  transmit  from  the  spool  in  response  to
an  S6,F23  “Transmit  Spooled  Messages”  request.  If
MaxSpoolTransmit  is  set  to  zero,  no  limit  is  placed  on
the    messages    sent    from    the    spool.    Multi-block
inquire/grant messages are not counted in this total.
OverWriteSpool — A boolean equipment constant used
to  indicate  to  the  equipment  whether  to  overwrite  data
in   the   spool   area   or   to   discard   further   messages
whenever the spool area limits are exceeded.
Send   Queue   —   Refers   to   the   queue   into   which
equipment  generated  SECS  messages  are  placed  in
preparation for transmission to the host.
Spool — The spool is an area of non-volatile storage in
which   the   equipment   stores   certain   messages   that
cannot be delivered to the host (when the equipment is
in    the    NOT    COMMUNICATING    substate    of
COMMUNICATIONS   ENABLED).   The   spool   area
can  be  thought  of  as  a  sequential  “ring”  buffer.  The
term  spool  is  also  used  to  denote  the  action  of  placing
messages into the spool area.
SpoolCountActual  —  A  status  variable  used  to  keep  a
count    of    the    messages    actually    stored    in    the
equipment’s   spool   area.   Multi-block   inquire/grant
messages  are  not  spooled  and  not  included  in  this
count.
SpoolCountTotal  —  A  status  variable  used  to  keep  a
count of the total number of primary messages directed
to  the  spool,  regardless  of  whether  placed  or  currently
retained    in    the    spool.    Multi-block    inquire/grant
messages  are  not  spooled  and  not  included  in  this
count.
SpoolFullTime   —   A   status   variable   containing   the
timestamp when the spool last became full. If the spool
was  not  filled  during  the  last  spooling  period,  this  will
contain     a     time     value     prior     to     the     current
SpoolStartTime.
SpoolStartTime  —  A  status  variable  containing  the
timestamp from when spooling was last activated.
4. 11.3  Description
4. 11.3.1  Spooling State Model — There are two major
states  of  spooling:  SPOOL  INACTIVE  and  SPOOL
ACTIVE.   SPOOL   ACTIVE   has   two   components:
SPOOL UNLOAD and SPOOL LOAD. These are each
broken  into  substates.  A  description  of  all  spooling
states,    substates,    and    applicable    state    transitions
follows.  The  POWER  OFF  and  POWER  ON  parent
states  are  common  to  all  equipment  subsystems.  They
are  shown  here  to  illustrate  the  retention  of  spooling
context during a power down situation.
NOTE  20:  Disabling  SECS  communications  does  not  affect
the  current  spooling  state  since  no  messages  are  generated
until  communications  are  subsequently  enabled.  Spooling  is
effectively frozen in this case.
POWER OFF
The  equipment  has  lost  power  for  any  reason  (e.g.,
power failure, power switch set to off).
POWER ON
The equipment is powered up.
SPOOL INACTIVE
This is the normal operating mode. No spooling occurs.
The spool area is empty. Primary SECS-II messages are
transmitted normally.
SPOOL ACTIVE
All  primary  SECS-II  messages  ready  for  sending  and
for which spooling is enabled (see S2,F43) are directed
to  the  spool  area.  All  other  primary  messages,  except
Stream 1, are discarded. The equipment shall attempt to
send  any  secondary  messages  that  are  generated  and
discard these messages should the attempt to send fail.
Spool  state  transitions  from  SPOOL  INACTIVE  to
SPOOL  ACTIVE  if  the  communications  state  changes
from    COMMUNICATING    to    NOT    COMMUNI-
CATING (Communication State Transition Table, #14)
or     from     WAIT     CRA     to     WAIT     DELAY
(Communication STATE Transition Table, #6).</p><p>SEMI E30-1103 © SEMI 1992, 2003
64</p><p>Figure 4.11
Spooling State Diagram</p><p>Once  communications  are  established,  the  host  must
initiate   the   spool   unload   sequence   to   restore   full
functionality  (see  below).  Since  the  equipment  will
deliver  secondary  messages,  the  host  may  inquire  for
information or send commands as needed.
The   SPOOL   ACTIVE   state   has   two   AND   states:
SPOOL  LOAD  and  SPOOL  UNLOAD.  This  means
that  they  operate  independently,  though  sharing  data
and  some  state  change  stimuli.  See  Section  3.1  for
explanation of state model terms and notation.
SPOOL LOAD
The  SPOOL  LOAD  component  enters  messages  into
the spool area. It is divided into two substates: SPOOL
NOT FULL and SPOOL FULL. SPOOL NOT FULL is
the  default  entry  substate  of  the  parent  state  SPOOL
LOAD.
SPOOL NOT FULL
As primary SECS-II messages are directed to the spool
area, the equipment shall “write” the SECS-II message
to     the     end     of     the     spool.     Status     variables
SpoolCountTotal    and    SpoolCountActual    shall    be
incremented each time a message is placed in the spool
area.
SPOOL FULL
In  this  state,  all  of  the  allocated  spooling  area  is  filled.
Choice  of  the  following  options  shall  be  controlled  by
the  setting  of  a  Boolean  equipment  constant  called
“OverWriteSpool.” The first message to be dealt with is
that  which  could  not  be  fit  into  the  spool  prior  to
transition  from  SPOOL  NOT  FULL  (see  transition
table below).
OverWriteSpool  is  True:  The  equipment  deletes  as
many  of  the  “oldest”  records  (e.g.,  SECS-II  messages)
contained in the spool area necessary to make space for
the  new  message  and  then  adds  the  message.  Status
variable     SpoolCountTotal     shall     be     incremented
whenever  a  message  is  submitted  to  the  spool  area.
Status variable SpoolCountActual shall be manipulated
to  keep  an  accurate  count  of  the  number  of  messages
contained  in  the  spool  area.  For  example,  if  it  is
necessary  to  delete  three  messages  in  the  spool  area  to
spool   one   message,   SpoolCountActual   would   have
three subtracted and then one added to the total.
OverWriteSpool   is   False:   Any   subsequent   primary
messages  shall  be  discarded.  When  such  a  message  is
discarded, SpoolCountTotal is incremented.
SPOOL UNLOAD
The SPOOL UNLOAD component of SPOOLACTIVE
deals  with  movement  of  messages  out  of  the  spool.  It
has   an   active   substate   (SPOOL   OUTPUT)   and   a
passive  substate  (NO  SPOOL  OUTPUT).  NO  SPOOL
OUTPUT   is   the   default   entry   substate,   since   the
equipment  is  NOT  COMMUNICATING  at  the  time
spooling  is  initiated.  When  communications  between
equipment and host are restored, there is an opportunity
for  the  host  to  recover  spooled  messages.  No  action  is
taken  until  the  host  initiates  the  spool  output  process
via  the  S6,F23  (Request  Spooled  Data).  The  host  has
the  option  to  either  receive  the  spooled  messages  (see
substate  TRANSMIT  SPOOL)  or  discard  all  messages
in the spool (see substate PURGE SPOOL).
NO SPOOL OUTPUT
In this state, no messages are removed from the spool.
SPOOL OUTPUT
The  SPOOL  OUTPUT  state  encompasses  the  removal
of  messages  from  the  spool.  Its  substates  are  TRANS-
MIT SPOOL and PURGE SPOOL.
TRANSMIT SPOOL
The host elects to receive all messages contained in the
spool area. The equipment is expected to keep track of
the  oldest  record  (i.e.,  message)  within  the  spool  area.
When  communications  are  re-established  with  the  host
and transmission of the spool area is started, the oldest
record  must  be  the  first  record  transmitted,  then  the
next  oldest  record,  etc.  There  is  no  prioritization  of
messages to be sent from the spool.
As each spooled message is successfully transmitted to
the  host,  it  is  removed  from  the  spool  area  upon
successful    completion    of    the    transaction.    Spool-
CountActual   is   decremented   as   each   message   is
removed  from  the  spool.  The  equipment  shall  transmit</p><p>SEMI E30-1103 © SEMI 1992, 2003
65
messages  only  from  the  spool  area  until  all  spooled
messages have been completely transmitted to the host.
Flow  control  of  the  spool  transmit  process  is  achieved
in  two  ways.  First,  only  one  open  transaction  on  the
equipment  is  allowed  during  spool  unload.  Thus,  if  a
message  requires  a  reply,  the  equipment  shall  wait  for
that reply before transmitting the next spooled message.
Messages  which  require  no  reply  may  be  transmitted
sequentially    as    rapidly    as    the    message    transfer
mechanism will allow.
The second flow control method is to allow the host to
limit  the  maximum  number  of  messages  sent  from  the
spool in response to the S6,F23 request. An equipment
constant  named  MaxSpoolTransmit  may  be  set  by  the
host  to  achieve  this  behavior.  If  MaxSpoolTransmit  is
set  to  five,  for  example,  the  equipment  will  send  the
first five messages from the spool and then transition to
the  NO  SPOOL  OUTPUT  state,  awaiting  the  next
S6,F23  request.  There  is  no  event  report  generated
when   MaxSpoolTransmit   is   reached.   The   host   is
responsible   for   determining   this   situation   by   a)
counting  the  messages  received,  b)  timing  out  waiting
for the next message, c) inquiring to the equipment for
the   curent   value   of   the   SpoolCountActual   status
variable,  or  d)  some  combination  of  the  above.  If
MaxSpool-Transmit  is  set  to  zero,  the  spool  shall  be
transmitted completely in response to S6,F23.
Normal  spooling  continues  during  the  spool  transmit
process.   If   the   SPOOL   LOAD   component   should
transi-tion to SPOOL FULL, it shall not have any effect
on  the  SPOOL  UNLOAD  component.  Once  full,  the
spool cannot make the transition back to SPOOL NOT
FULL  except  via  the  SPOOL  INACTIVE  state.  Space
made  available  due  to  the  spool  unload  process  shall
not be used in this case.
When  a  multi-block  message  is  to  be  transmitted  from
the  spool,  any  required  inquire/grant  transaction  shall
be initiated. If the host’s response denies permission to
send the multi-block message, the equipment shall dis-
card  that  message  and  continue  with  the  transmit  pro-
cess.  This  sequence  shall  count  as  one  message  in  the
MaxSpoolTransmit count.
There  is  one  area  where  SPOOL  LOAD  and  SPOOL
UNLOAD  may  interact:  When  the  spool  is  full  and
OverWriteSpool is True. During the spool transmit pro-
cess, spooled messages are being removed and new pri-
mary  messages  are  being  written  to  the  spool.  These
new  messages  are  overwriting  the  oldest  messages
available, unless the unload process has freed sufficient
spool  space.  There  is  a  possibility  that  the  unload  and
overwrite  processes  may  compete  for  control  of  the
same  message  area.  For  example,  if  the  spool  holds
messages  ABCDE,  with  A  oldest  and  E  newest,  A
might  be  sent  to  the  host,  B  (and  the  space  from  A)
overwritten by the new message F, C sent to the host, D
and  E  (and  the  space  from  message  C)  overwritten  by
G,  etc.  The  loss  of  continuity  may  be  “disorienting”  to
the host program receiving the messages. It is expected
that  the  unload  process  will  be  fast  relative  to  the
generation  of  new  messages,  so  that  this  occurrence
will be rare.
Should a communication failure occur during the spool
transmit  process,  spooling  shall  continue  as  before  the
transmit  process  began.  However,  the  spool  unload
sequence shall terminate (i.e., transition to NO SPOOL
OUTPUT will occur — see transition table below).
PURGE SPOOL
The  equipment  shall  discard  all  messages  in  the  spool
and, when the spool is empty, zero SpoolCountActual.</p><p>SEMI E30-1103 © SEMI 1992, 2003

provide  the  host  with  the  ability  to  enable  and  disable
Spooling  for  any  message  (except  Stream  1  messages
(i.e.,  S1,F1,  S1,F13))  via  the  S2,F43/F44  transaction.
Spooling  may  be  enabled  for  an  entire  Stream,  for
individual   messages   within   a   stream,   or   for   any
combination  of  the  two.  Streams  and  Functions  not
referenced  in  this  message  are  not  spooled.  Spooling
can  be  totally  disabled  by  sending  an  S2,F43  with  a
zero length list for the first item (see S2,F43 definition).
In  addition,  the  equipment  shall  provide  an  equipment
constant, EnableSpooling, to allow setting the enable or
disable  of  spooling.  NOTE:  When  EnableSpooling  is
false,    the    SPOOL    state    cannot    transition    from
SPOOLINACTIVE    to    SPOOLACTIVE.    Changing

Spooling” has changed to false.
4. 11.4  Requirements   —   The   following   items   are
required to support the spooling capability:
—  At  a  minimum,  the  equipment  shall  reserve  for
spooling    non-volatile    storage    with    sufficient
capacity   to   store   all   of   the   primary   SECS-II
messages   that   would   occur   during   a   normal
processing cycle.
—  While spooling is enabled, the equipment shall reply
to  primary  messages  sent  by  the  host  with  the
appropriate secondary message.
—   Secondary   messages   which   cannot   be   delivered
shall be discarded, never spooled.
—   All   spooling-related   status   variables   and   setup
information  (as  per  S2,F43)  must  be  stored  in  non-
volatile  memory  along  with  any  other  information
required  for  the  potential  unloading  of  the  spool
area after a power loss.
—   Upon   powerup,   the   equipment   shall   retain   all
spooling  context  from  the  time  the  equipment  was
last  shutdown  or  reset.  This  means  that  spooling,  if
previously active, continues upon system powerup.
—   The   Equipment   must   reject   any   message   that
attempts to set “Spooling” for Stream 1.
—   If   a   multi-block   primary   message   need   for   the

model  has  two  areas  of  configuration.  The  first  area  is
related  to  default  entry  states  of  the  state  model.  Upon
system initialization, the system must activate either the
ON-LINE  or  OFF-LINE  state.  Upon  entry  to  OFF-
LINE,  the  system  must  in  turn  activate  one  of  the
substates   of   OFF-LINE   (EQUIPMENT   OFF-LINE,
ATTEMPT  ON-LINE,  or  HOST  OFF-LINE).  In  both
these  cases,  the  user  shall  configure  the  equipment  to
make  the  choices  appropriate  to  that  factory.  Entry  to
the  ON-LINE  state  also  involves  a  choice  of  substates.
In   this   case,   the   equipment   reads   the   front   panel
REMOTE/LOCAL switch to determine the appropriate
state.
The second area of configuration involves the transition
to  be  made  if  the  ON-LINE  attempt  should  fail.  The
model  may  be  set  to  transition  to  either  HOST  OFF-
LINE or to EQUIPMENT OFF-LINE should the S1,F1
transaction   be   terminated   unsuccessfully.   Choosing
HOST   OFF-LINE   allows   the   host   to   cause   the
equipment  to  transition  to  ON-LINE  when  the  host
becomes  ready.  This  is  accomplished  via  the  message
S1,F17 (see below).</li><li>12.3.2 Changing Control State — In the control state
model,  both  the  operator  and  the  host  can  affect  the
control  state.  The  operator  retains  ultimate  authority  to
set  the  equipment  OFF-LINE  by  means  of  an  OFF-
LINE  switch  mechanism.  The  operator  also  can  cause
the equipment to attempt to go ON-LINE. Under some
circumstances,  the  host  can  initiate  the  transition  to
ON-LINE.
If  the  operator  requests  ON-LINE,  the  equipment  will
send  an  S1,F1  to  the  host.  The  host  may  confirm  ON-</li></ol><p>SEMI E30-1103 © SEMI 1992, 2003

that it transition to OFF-LINE. It will transition into the
HOST   OFF-LINE   substate.   When   the   equipment
HOST  OFF-LINE  state  is  active,  the  host  may  request
that it transition to ON-LINE. The combination of these
two allow the host to cycle the equipment between ON-
LINE and OFF-LINE.
Only  the  operator  may  change  the  ON-LINE  substate
(REMOTE or LOCAL).
4. 12.4  Requirements
—    The    equipment    shall    supply    a    method    for
configuring   the   default   CONTROL   state   to   be
activated  upon  system  initialization.  The  choice  of
states   must   be   among   ATTEMPT   ON-LINE,
EQUIPMENT  OFF-LINE,  HOST  OFF-LINE,  and
ON-LINE.
—    The    equipment    shall    supply    a    method    for
configuring  which  state  should  be  activated  when
the  attempt  to  go  ON-LINE  fails.  The  option  is  a
transition to either the HOST OFF-LINE state or the
EQUIPMENT OFF-LINE state.
—  The  equipment  shall  supply  a  momentary  switch
which  will  initiate  the  transition  to  OFF-LINE  and
another  which  will  begin  the  process  to  go  ON-
LINE.  Discrete  position  switches  shall  not  be  used.
These  should  be  designed  so  that  they  may  not  be
actuated    simultaneously.    The    switch    may    be
mounted  on  the  front  panel  or  be  available  via
keyboard input at the operator console.
—  The  equipment  shall  supply  a  discrete  two-position
switch  which  the  operator  may  use  to  indicate  the
desired  substate  for  ON-LINE  (i.e.,  REMOTE  or
LOCAL).  The  switch  may  be  mounted  on  the  front
panel  or  be  available  via  keyboard  input  at  the
operator  console.  If  implemented  in  software,  this
setting shall be retained in non-volatile storage.
—  The equipment shall supply an indicator on the front
panel  which  displays  the  full  identification  of  the
current    CONTROL    state/substate    (e.g.,    OFF-
LINE/ATTEMPT     ON-LINE).     This     may     be
accomplished  either  with  labelled  display  lights  or</p><p>23 If there is no host response (i.e. reply timeout), the equipment shall
treat it as a denial.
via the operator console display. It is recommended
that this indicator be visible at all times.
—  The  equipment  shall  supply  a  status  variable  that
contains the current state/substate of the CONTROL
state model.
—  Whenever  the  ON-LINE/REMOTE  state  is  active
and    the    operator    issues    a    command    to    the
equipment,  the  equipment  shall  cause  an  “operator

5  Data Items
The  following  sections  specify  which  data  items  and
variable data items are required.
Except  for  the  specified  format  restrictions,  all  data
items  and  variable  data  items  follow  the  definitions
contained in SEMI E5.
5. 1  Data Item Restrictions — The following is a subset
of  the  data  items  used  by  SECS-II  messages  specified
in  this  standard.  Each  data  item  listed  in  this  section  is
restricted  in  its  SEMI  E5-defined  usage.  Most  are
limited  to  a  single  format  from  their  standard  list  of
formats.   Data   items   used   by   SECS-II   messages
contained   in   this   document,   but   which   have   no
restrictions are not duplicated here.
NOTE 21: One data item, ALCD, is restricted in other than its
format. Take note of this restriction as described below.
NOTE   22:   The   equipment   supplier   shall   document   any
restrictions  on  length  or  format  of  CPNAME.  Suppliers  shall
document   the   behavior   of   spaces   in   a   CPNAME.   The
maximum  length  of  CPNAME  shall  be  40.  This  change
became effective in September 1995.
ACKC7A                  Format:                  51
ALCD Only bit 8 (alarm set/cleared) of the
binary byte is used. Bits 1–7,
denoting alarm category, are not
used.

6  Collection Events
Table 6.1 provides the list of collection events required
to   support   the   capabilities   addressed   within   this
standard.  Also  shown  are  typical  variable  data  that
would   most   likely   be   included   in   the   associated
collection  event  report  and  a  reference  to  the  event
trigger and to the appropriate section of the standard.
This  list  does  not  represent  all  events  that  might  be
needed  to  properly  monitor/control  equipment.  Many
events    are    unique    to    the    specific    equipment
characteristics.  The  needed  additions  are  a  matter  for
other    standards    and    for    collaboration    between
equipment supplier and user.
See Section 5.2 for further detail of variable data items.</li></ol><p>SEMI E30-1103 © SEMI 1992, 2003
