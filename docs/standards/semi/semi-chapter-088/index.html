1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1        This    standard    establishes    the    properties    and
physical  of  two  port  components  for  1.5  inch  type
surface mount gas distribution systems.
2  Scope</li><li>1      This   document   includes   common   requirements,
layout,  size,  detailed  specifications,  and  dimensions  of
the components.</li><li>2    This  standard  applies  to  all  two  port  four  fastener
components  (except  mass  flow  controllers  and  mass
flow  meters).    The  components  (i.e.  valves,  pressure
regulators,  pressure  transducers,  filters  and  purifiers)
are  mounted  on  substrates  with  fasteners  accessible
from the top.</li><li>3    This  standard  only  applies  to  components,  which
control flow of ≤ 50 slm nitrogen equivalent at 308 kPa
(44.7   psia).      This   standard   also   only   applies   to
components  with  operating  pressures  less  than  3445
kPa (500 psia) at 20°C.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1    This  standard  only  addresses  the  component;  it
does  not  address  the  seals,  the  sealing  system,  or  the
assembly    process    and    does    not    guarantee    the
performance of the sealing system.  The user should be
aware that gas delivery system performance and sealing
system  performance  are  addressed  elsewhere  in  the
SEMI standards.</li><li>2        The    user    should    be    aware    that    alternative
technologies are commercially available.</li><li>3  International, national, and local codes, regulations,
and   laws   should   be   consulted   to   ensure   that   the
equipment   meets   regulatory   requirements   in   each
location of use.

chemical  supplied  as  a  liquid  and  used  in  Chemical
Vapor  Deposition  (CVD).    Many  liquid  precursors  are
toxic, reactive and air-sensitive.
5  Ports</li><li>1    A  canister  has  a  gas  inlet  port  and  a  liquid  outlet
port.    The  outlet  port  is  equipped  with  a  dip-tube,
marked  according  to  SEMI  F66.    Note  that  a  canister
may be used as a bubbler, by using the dip-tube port as
the  gas  inlet.    In  this  standard  however,  liquid  delivery
is  assumed  and  the  dip-tube  port  will  be  referred  to  as
the “outlet”.</li><li>2  Canisters up to 100 liters in volume:</li><li>2.1  The ports will be located with the dip tube at the
3  o’clock  position  and  the  gas  inlet  at  the  9  o’clock
position, as illustrated in Figure 1.</li></ol><p>L</p><p>Figure 1

will be no more than 0.5 mm.
5. 6    Additional  ports  may  be  provided  so  long  as  they
do not interfere with the above specifications.
NOTE   1:      The   user   of   this   standard   should   evaluate   the
consequences  of  connecting  a  given  precursor  to  a  point
intended  for  other  precursors.    The  nature  of  the  precursor
itself  and  of  the  other  precursors  expected  to  be  in  use  at  the
same   location   should   be   taken   into   account.      Consider
packaging  precursors  with  a  non-standard  connector  on  the
canister outlet if necessary to avoid a dangerous situation.
6  Valves
6. 1    The  inlet  and  outlet  port  are  each  provided  with  a
valve  but  the  details  of  those  valves  are  not  specified

SPECIFICATION FOR FACILITY PACKAGE INTEGRATION,
MONITORING AND CONTROL
This   specification   was   technically   approved   by   the   Global   Facilities   Committee   and   is   the   direct
responsibility  of  the  European  Global  Facilities  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  European
Regional Standards Committee on November 10, 2004.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> January 2005; to
be published March 2005.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  The purpose of this specification is to provide the requirements for the architecture, functionality and interfaces
for  Facility  Monitoring  and  Control  Systems  and  the  various  Facility  Package  Units  to  enable  a  standardized  and
integrated  communication  between  them.    This  specification  is  appended  with  related  information  to  provide
application examples.</li><li>2  Background and Motivation</li><li>2.1  Today, the suppliers of Facility Package Units (e.g., chemicals, power supply, gases, HVAC) are often using
individual  communication  concepts.    This  leads  to  high  efforts  to  specify  the  communication  structures  between
Facility  Package  Units  (FPU)  and  the  Facility  Monitoring  and  Control  Systems  (FMCS),  to  evaluate  the  quoted
solutions and to eventually integrate these units.  These individual, not standardized concepts today are not reusable,
bear risks in execution and lead to high maintenance costs.</li><li>2.2  This   specification   is   a   first   step   to   standardize   the   communication   between   facility   and   monitoring
components.    Therefore,  it  focuses  in  its  scope  to  a  small  set  of  requirements  which  are  common  to  all  FPUs.    As
this  communication  concept  is  adopted  by  the  various  FPU  suppliers  and  their  customers,  more  specific  standards
describing particular FPUs and their services may evolve.</li><li>3  Who and what is addressed by this standard.</li><li>3.1  A standardization of the communication concept between FMCS and FPUs will support Facility Package Unit
manufacturers, general contractors, system integrators, purchasers, and control system manufacturers.  It will lead to
substantially reduced costs, more reliable execution times, and optimized maintenance concepts.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This standard specifies the requirements for the architecture, common services, data, and its semantic meaning
to  integrate  the  FPUs  into  the  FMCS.    For  this  purpose,  a  basic  set  of  common  services  (operations)  between  the
FMCS  and  the  FPUs  are  specified  to  exchange FPU status information and data.  In addition, the state models for
FPUs are described.</li><li>2  Out of scope for this standard are:
• Services of FMCS provided to interface to Manufacturing Execution Systems or Enterprise Resource Planning
Systems,
• Specification  of  functionality  of  particular  FMCS  functions  (graphical  user  interface  (GUI),  data  archives,
reporting archives, alarm handling, etc.), and
• The specification of the interface between FPU control level and FPU field level.</li><li>3  Applicability — This standard applies to the field of facility management and is targeted for FPU suppliers and
FMCS suppliers for systems integration, engineering and commissioning as well as the operation of such systems by
the purchasers.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.</li></ol><p>SEMI F97-0305 © SEMI 2005 2

7  Ordering Information
7. 1  When integrating FPUs into a FMCS, suppliers and purchasers have to agree on details on how the integration
will  be  performed.    This  includes  a  number  of  items  such  as  the  information  to  be  exchanged  between  FMCS  and
FPUs, the communication protocol to be used
2
, or details of the available FPU subcontrol level.  Other parties such
as fab planners or system integrators may be involved in this information exchange.  Related Information 2 provides
a template for the ordering information and examples for its use.
8  Conventions
8. 1  This standard follows the conventions for state model methodology and service definitions as defined by other
SEMI  standards  supplemented  by  specific  extensions.    The  conventions  used  in  this  standard  are  described  in  the
following paragraphs.
8. 2  State Model Methodology
8. 2.1  This  document  uses  the  state  model  methodology  as  defined  within  SEMI  E30  to  describe  the  behavior  of
FPUs.  A state model is comprised of the following elements:
• definitions of each state and sub state,
• a diagram of the states and the transition between states, and
• a state transition table.
8. 2.2  The diagram of the state model uses the Harel State Chart notation
3
.
8. 3  Notion of Alarm-Mode, Warning-Mode, Error-Mode — Signifies the importance of the situation that occurred at
the  FPU  to  draw  attention  at  the  FMCS.    Error-Mode  is  generally  used  to  signify  an  error.    This  error  may  be
persistent  for  some  time  until  the  error  situation  is  corrected.    Warning-Mode  may  be  used  to  signal  a  higher
awareness that is to be raised at the FMCS.  Again, attention may be needed to correct the problem.  Alarm-Mode
signals the highest awareness required and may again need some attention for correction.  The use of which mode is
used  when  and  where  is  intentionally  left  to  the  agreement  between  the  purchaser  and  the  supplier.    It  is
recommended to use always the same philosophy for use of these three modes for the entire facility when possible.
8. 4  Transition Tables
8. 4.1  Transition Tables are provided in conjunction with the state diagrams to explicitly describe the nature of each
state transition.  A transition table contains columns for transition number, previous state, trigger, new state, actions
and a remark.  The trigger for the transition occurs while in the previous state.  The actions include a combination of
actions taken upon exit of the previous state and actions taken upon entry into the new state.

Actions                Remark</p><ol start="8"><li>5  Operation Representation</li><li>5.1  Operations  are  used  to  describe  interfaces  between  different  resources  (e.g.  interfaces  between  FMCS  and
FPUs).    An  operation  definition  table  defines  the  specific  set  of  operations  for  a  specific  resource  as  shown  in  the
following table:
Operation                                              Description</li></ol><ol start="8"><li>5.2  Operation — Defines the operation name.  The operation name has to be unique for each given resource.</li><li>5.3  Description — Gives a short comprehensive description of the operation with regard to functionality.</li></ol><p>2  As an example, OPC Data Access combined with the agreed communications protocol may be used for interconnecting FMCS and FPUs.

8. 6  Parameter Definitions
8. 6.1  When  calling  an  operation,  parameters  can  be  passed  and  returned.    Parameters  to  be  passed  and  returned
depend upon the operation that is called.  By using a parameter definition table the parameters passed and returned
by an operation are defined.
Parameter  Description Direction             Data             Type</p><ol start="8"><li>6.2  Parameter — Within the parameter column the name of the specific parameter is given.</li><li>6.3  Description — Contains a description of a parameter.</li><li>6.4  Direction — Defines the direction:
• FMCS -&gt; FPU: originated by FMCS and received by FPU
• FPU -&gt; FMCS: originated by FPU and received by FMCS</li><li>6.5  Data Type — Defines the format of a parameter.</li><li>7  Field Definitions</li><li>7.1  A  parameter  can  consist  of  different  fields  that  define  the  contents  of  a  parameter.    A  field  definition  table
defines the format of the fields maintained within a specific parameter.
Field  BitMeaning Mandatory/optional</li></ol><ol start="8"><li>7.2  Field — A parameter can consist of different fields representing the contents of a parameter.  Within the field
column the name of the specific field is given.</li><li>7.3  Bit — In case a field is stored within a bitwise-formatted parameter, the bit column defines the bit number or
bit range where the field value is stored.</li><li>7.4  Meaning — Defines the meaning of the one or several field values.</li><li>7.5  Mandatory/Optional — Defines if setting the value of a field is either mandatory or optional.
9  Requirements</li><li>1  Interconnection between FMCS and FPUs</li><li>1.1  The interconnection between the FMCS and the FPUs may be made by any type of bus system specified by
SEMI (e.g. SEMI E54 series) as well as industrial ethernet based networks.  It is the purpose of this standard:
• to specify the semantics of the services that are exchanged between the FMCS and the FPUs, and
• to model the status information of the state machines that are maintained by the FPUs.</li><li>1.2  As introduced in §7, state models are used to represent the current state of a FPU.  The FMCS may use this
state information in order to display the state of all FPUs.  In addition, the FMCS may decide based on the state of a
FPU whether remote operations on a FPU are advisable or not.

9. 2  FPU Requirements
9. 2.1  The FPU shall be able to run without a FMCS and shall communicate a minimal amount of status information
to FMCS via the network as described in the next section.
9. 3  FMCS Requirements
9. 3.1  The  FMCS  shall  be  able  to  support  the  interface  to  the  FPU  and  to  make  the  information  of  this  interface
available through the Data Cache of the FMCS.  The FMCS shall be able to either monitor and/or control the FPU
depending on the application.
9. 4  State Models of Facility Package Unit
9. 4.1  State Models are used to describe the status of the FPU.  For the definition of the status models see §8.  In the
following all status values are specified together with their transitions.
9. 4.2  Watchdog-Toggle
9. 4.2.1  The  Watchdog-toggle  shall  be  used  to  signal  that  a  FPU  still  is  capable  to  perform  its  processing  function
and  is  able  to  notify  this  to  the  FMCS.    As  long  as  the  toggle  mechanism  alternates  between  “on”  and  “off”  the
processing  function  of  the  FPU  is  assumed  to  be  functional.    The  processing  function  is  assumed  to  be  a
programmed function, e.g. for a PLC.  The toggle mechanism shall be linked into the processing function of the FPU
so  that  if  the  processing  function  stops,  the  toggle  mechanism  will  stop  as  well.    Watchdog-toggle  represents  a
variable that toggles its value between “0” and “1” within a specified time window.  The maximum required cycle
time shall not exceed one minute.  The Watchdog-toggle is used to realize a “life-beat monitoring function”.
9. 4.2.2  The Watchdog-toggle is always required except
• in the case that the underlying communication system of the FPU and the FMCS already provides an integrated
life-beat function, or
• the FPU is a very simple device which does not provide any processing function (e.g., a valve, electrical engine
or heater).</p><p>Watchdog-Toggle

Local  and  Remote.    The  behavior  of  the  FPU  with  respect  to the states Local and Remote is out of scope.  It is
dependent  on  the  type  of  FPU.    Control  Mode  is  intended  to  be  used  by  the  FMCS  to  identify  whether  a  remote
operation of the FPU is enabled or disabled – by this the FMCS can allow or disallow operator actions on the FMCS</li></ol><p>SEMI F97-0305 © SEMI 2005 10
with respect to that particular FPU.  On the FPU this control mode may be used to enable or disable remote control
of the FMCS.
• Local: FPU operates in local mode, i.e. it can be controlled locally.
• Remote: FPU operates in remote mode, i.e. it can be remotely controlled by the FMCS.</p><p>Control-Mode

by or Run.  The behavior of the FPU with respect to the states of Run-Mode is out of scope.  It is dependent on the
type of FPU.  The Annex to this Standard (see Related Information 1) provides some examples of the use of Run-
Mode.  The Run-Mode provides general information of the FPU, whether it is Down, in Stand-by or in Run:
• Down  (the  FPU  is  in  a  fault  situation  or  it  may  be  switched  into  Down  by  a  pre  scheduled  function;  this  is
specified by an optional flag):
o flag set for scheduled down
o flag set for unscheduled down
• Stand-by (the FPU is ready to be switched into Run).
• Run (the FPU is running).</li><li>4.5.2  The FPU should assume optionally sub states when in Run or Stand-by.  These sub states are:
• Run: sub state Locked (the FPU is locked to hold the Run state) or Not_Locked and
• Stand-by: sub state Locked (the FPU is locked to hold the Stand-by state) or Not_Locked.</li></ol></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-tags-row row margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/tags/semi">SEMI</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/tags/standard">Standard</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/your-org/semiconductor-docs/tree/main/docs/standards/semi/semi-chapter-088.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>编辑此页</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="文件选项卡"></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">文档</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/ic-design/intro">芯片设计</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/process/intro">工艺制造</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/eda-tools/intro">EDA工具</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/standards/intro">协议标准</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">社区</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/your-org/semiconductor-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/blog">技术博客</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">更多</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/blog">更新日志</a></li><li class="footer__item">
