This\ndiameter  would  normally  be  chosen  to  be  the  nominal\ndiameter  of  the  fixed  quality  area  to  allow  for  such\nthings  as  an  edge  exclusion,  tolerance  variations  in  the\nwafer  diameter,  and  edge  rounding.  Table  2  shows  the\ncircle diameters for a series of grids which have a fixed\nquality area radius 3 or 4 mm smaller than the nominal\nradius of selected wafers specified in SEMI M1.\n5. 1.3    Identification  of  each  grid  element  is  done  by\nreferring  to  a  circle  number  and  a  division  number  on\nthat  circle.  Circles  are  numbered  from  the  center  out,\nwith   the   center   circle   being   number   01   and   the\noutermost  circle  being  number  18.

An\nelement\u2019s  address  is  given  by  two  sets  of  numbers\nseparated  by  a  comma:  circle  (0\u201318),  division  (01\u2013n).\nElements 18, 01 and 18, 100 are identified in Figure 1.\n5. 2  Wafers without a Primary Flat\n5. 2.1    The  grid  elements  for  wafers  without  a  primary\nflat are illustrated in Figure 1. This pattern is generated\nby  making  concentric  circles  with  relative  diameters\nand radial divisions as specified in Table 1. In this table\nthe  circle  number  is  given  in  the  leftmost  column.  The\nnumber  of  divisions  and  the  included  angle  of  each\ndivision  in  the  circle  are  given  in  the  second  and  third\ncolumns. The total number of divisions (from the center\noutward)  is  given  in  the  fourth  column.  The  included\narea ratio, given in the fifth column, is the total number\nof  divisions  included  within  a  circle  divided  by  1000,\nthe  total  number  of  divisions  in  the  grid.  The  relative\ndiameter,  given  in  the  rightmost  column,  is  the  square\nroot of the included area ratio.\n5. 3  Wafers with a Primary Flat\n5. 3.1      For   wafers   with   a   primary   flat,   a   standard\nincluded angle of 43.2\xb0 is used for all wafer sizes. This\nangle was chosen because it lies between the maximum\nand  minimum  included  angles  of  the  primary  flats\nspecified in SEMI M1 for 100 mm, 125 mm, 150 mm,\nand  200  mm  diameter  wafers.  In  addition,  if  a  fixed\nquality area of radius 3 mm less than the nominal wafer\nradius (or smaller) is used, the grid will not in any case\nextend beyond the edge of the wafer in the region of the\nprimary flat.\n5. 3.2      This   flat   is   propagated   into   the   wafer   as\nillustrated in Figure 2. The diameter of each circle is the\nsame  as  for  wafers  without  a  primary  flat.  The  flat  is\npropagated  vertically  downward  (starting  with  circle\nnumber  3)  by  the  intersection  of  the  circle  with  a\nhorizontal chord which subtends 43.2\xb0.\n5. 3.3      The   areas   of   the   grid   elements   within   the\npropagated flat region are slightly smaller than the areas\nof  the  regular  grid  elements.  This  difference  is  ignored\nwhen counting grid elements for wafers with a primary\nflat.

The  number  of  grid  elements  which  contain\ndefects  is  counted.    The  element  count  divided  by  10\ncorresponds to the percent of defective area.  This grid\ncould   also   be   superimposed   onto   a   CRT   display,\nphotograph,    or    computer    generated    map,    where\napplicable.    In  use,  grid  pattern  diameters  must  be\nscaled to the size of the map or image of the wafer to be\noverlaid."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M17-0704 \xa9 SEMI 1990, 2004 3\nTable 1  Grid Element

Section  3\nconsiders  subclasses  of  these  characteristics  defining\nthe   species   which   may   be   used   for   producing   the\nconductivity  type.  For  semi-insulating  material,  special\ncases have been isolated.\nUndoped,  Grade  A1  represents  those  materials  which\nare  of  high  resistivity  and  stable  following  growth,\nwithout   necessitating   any   additional   annealing   or\nprocessing.   The   Grade   A2   material,   \u201chigh   purity\u201d,\nrequires    additional    thermal    processing    following\ngrowth to bring the resistivity to a level > 10\n7\n\u2126-cm.  At\nthis   time,   most   producers   have   indicated   that   the\nmajority   of   the   Grade   A2   ingots   have   resistivity\ncharacteristics which rise into the acceptable range after\nan    appropriate    thermal    cycle.        However,    this\nphenomenon  is  sensitive  to  the  details  of  the  time-\ntemperature cycle, and thus, such an increase cannot be\nguaranteed in every application.  Thus, the label \u201cGrade\nA2\u201d is used to denote this material.\nChromium  doping  produces  a  high  resistivity  material.\nHowever,   due   to   the   rapid   diffusion   of   Cr   during\nprocessing and the propensity for surface accumulation,\nit is not as well suited to processing as grades 3.A.1 and\n3. A.2, thus we assign this material \u201cgrade A\u201d.\nIso-electric dopant additions do not appear to affect the\nresistivity significantly, but rather, permit the reduction\nof dislocation generation in the final product. Thus, this\nmaterial  is  classified  Grade  A.  While  In  is  the  most\neffective hardening agent, Al, P, and Sb are also viable\nspecies.  They  are  included  for  completeness  and  to\nreduce  the  likelihood  of  document  revision  at  a  later\ndate.  The  Grade  B  specification  encompasses  those\nmaterials where the impurity and point defect densities\nare not quite in the proper balance, but the resistivity is\nsuitable for less-stringent applications.\nFor  conducting  material,  the  best  characterized,  non-\ntransition  metal  species  have  been  included  as  n-type\ndopants; for p-type, a broader range of species has been\nincluded,   as   transition   metals   are   useful   acceptor\nimpurities.\nSection  4  defines  the  resistivity  and  stability  of  semi-\ninsulating material as specified in Section 3. A stringent\nlimit was placed on the Grade A2 material to minimize\nthe   likelihood   that   this   material   converts   to   low\nresistivity   upon   annealing.   The   issue   of   surface\nconversion  in  Cr-doped  material  was  dealt  with  by\neliminating   a   requirement   for   n-type   characteristics\nfollowing annealing.\nThe  resistivity  ranges  for  n-type  conducting  material\nwere  determined  from  the  carrier  concentration  table\n(Section  5)  and  mobility  values,  using  the  analysis  of\nWalukiewicz  et  al,  J.  Appl.  Phys.  50  (1979)  899.  This\nplaces  a  constraint  on  the  permissible  compensation\nratio, selected to be in the range of approximately 0.0 to\n0. 7.  The  specification  was  designed  then  to  exclude\nabnormally  poor  crystals.  As  limited  data  and  demand\nexist  for  p-type  material,  there  are  no  ranges  specified\nat this writing. Should a significant body of data evolve,\nthis  specification  may  be  designed  and  balloted  as\nappropriate.\nSection   5   deals   with   impurity   concentrations,   net\nelectron   yields   and   implicitly,   with   point   defect\nconcentrations.  For  semi-insulating  material  of  high\nquality,  the  impurities  are,  at  the  present  time,  not\nreliably  measurable  (carbon  is  the  notable  exception).\nThus  the  \u201cunspecified\u201d  nomenclature.  For  types  A-3\nand   A-4,   the   determination   of   the   amount   of   the\nrelevant  impurity  species  is  given  to  the  appropriate\nparty, the user, and producer, respectively.\nFor n-type materials, the ranges were selected to define\na high purity regime (n \u2264 4 \xd7 10\n16\ncm\n-3\n), an intermediate\nregime where donor density is not more than ~10 times\nthe  typical  deep  level  density;  the  transition  region\nwherein  deep  levels  are  suppressed  (range  B-3);  a\nhighly    doped    range    (>    10    ppm    net    electron\nconcentration   yield);   and   \u201csaturation\u201d   doping   range\nwhere  the  crystal  growth  process  and  thermodynamics\ndetermine   the   limits   of   impurity   incorporation   and\nelectron yield.\nIn Section 6, the electron mobility values and ranges are\nstated.  For  semi-insulating  materials,  the  values  that\nhave  been  determined  by  consensus  are  5000  cm\n2\n/V-s\nfor  Grade  A1  and  6000  cm\n2\n/V-s.  In  the  interest  of\nharmony,     and     to     prevent     further     debilitating\ndiscussions,  the  authors  and  participants  at  the  SEMI\nmeetings, and responses from producers have been used\nto   set   this   value   at   5000   cm\n2\n/V-s.   The   producers\nindicated  that  the  Grade  A2  material  nearly  always\nexceeds 6000 cm\n2\n/V-s, and thus this value was adopted.\nFor  chromium  doped  materials,  the  mobility  is  less\npredictable  and,  therefore,  is  negotiated  between  the\nuser and producer. In-doped materials have consistently\nlower     mobilities,     resulting     from     strain-effects,"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M19-91 \xa9 SEMI 1991, 19962\nscattering, and other related phenomena. Thus, based on\nproducer  experience,  the  minimum  value  was  set  at\n3500 cm\n2\n/V-s.\nFor n-type materials, the mobility ranges were selected\nto   represent   compensation   ratios   in   the   range   of\napproximately   0.0   to   0.7   for   a   given   net   electron\nconcentration.  P-type  material  is  not  yet  characterized\nsufficiently to warrant a specification.\n2  Scope\nThis  document  specifies  the  characteristics  and  ranges\nof  electrical  properties  for  bulk  GaAs  crystals  and\nsubstrate   wafers.
