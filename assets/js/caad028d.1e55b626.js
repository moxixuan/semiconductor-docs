This   process   can   remove\nsignificant  material  from  the  marked  surface  of  a  300\nmm  wafer.    This  can  lead  to  reduced  dot  diameter  for\nmarks  with  \u201cv\u201d-shaped  profile,  to  the  point  that  the\nmark  no  longer  meets  the  requirements  of  SEMI  T7.\nThis can compromise the mark\u2019s readability.\nA1-1.2  This   specification   is   intended   to   identify\nlocations  on  the  back  surface  of  300  mm  reclaimed\nsilicon   wafers   for   re-inscribing   the   SEMI   T7   and\noptionally  the  OCR  (according  to  SEMI  M1.15)  laser\nmarks  in  order  to  maintain  traceability  after  multiple\nreclaims.\nA1-2  Scope\nA1-2.1  This      specification      defines      the      spatial\nrelationships for back surface marking of reclaimable or\nreclaimed   notched,   double-side   polished   300   mm\nwafers   of   silicon   with   pre-existing   manufacturers\u2019\nmarks which comply with SEMI M1.15.\nA1-2.2  Although this specification does not specify the\nmarking    equipment    or    techniques    that    may    be\nemployed  when  complying  with  its  requirements,  it  is\nrequired that the symbols be a \u201chard mark\u201d obtained by\nlaser scribing individual dots with diameter as specified\nin SEMI T7.\nNOTICE: This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address\nsafety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.

The  two-dimensional  PSD  curve  of  the\nsurface   can   then   be   calculated   from   the   angular\nspectrum  of  the  scattered  light  (BRDF).    R\nq\nas  well  as\nmq   may   be   calculated   from   a   one-dimensional   or\nisotropic  PSD  curve  for  a  given  spatial  bandwidth  as\nlong as the above mentioned limits are accommodated.\n7. 5.4\nSuch  tools  may  be  able  to  acce ss  a  spatial\nbandwidth  range  of  about  one-half  the  wavelength  of\nthe illuminating light up to several hundred \u03bcm.\n7. 6\nScanning Surface Inspection S ystems (SSIS)\n7. 6.1\nSSIS    measurements    are    integra ted    scatter\nmeasurements similar to those made by TIS systems, in\nthat  they  gather  light  over  large  solid  angles;  however,\nthere are some significant differences.  In general, most\nSSIS avoid light collection within five to ten degrees of\nthe  specular  beam,  because  in  this  region  the  scatter\ntends  to  be  dominated  by  surface  roughness  scatter\n(which becomes background noise) competing with the\nsignal  from  laser  light  scattering  events.    The  early\n(older)  scanners  generally  had  one  detector  measuring\nlight  from  a  very  large  solid  angle  collector.    Later\nsystems  tend  to  use  several  smaller  collection  angles,\neach    with    their    own    detector.        Whatever    the\narrangement,  each  collection  angle  can  be  defined  in\nterms  of  its  spatial  frequency  band  pass  region,  and\neach    detector    will    have    some    background    haze\ncomponent  (or  threshold)  that  is  caused  by  surface\nroughness.  Thus, in the absence of laser light scattering\nevents,  measured  haze  may  be  converted  to  an  rms\nroughness  for  the  defined  spatial  frequencies.    This\nconversion    assumes    that    the    surface    meets    the\nnecessary   (smooth,   clean,   front   surface   reflective)\nconditions required for roughness calculations, and that"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M40-0200 \xa9 SEMI 20006\nother  noise  sources,  such  as  background  electronic\nnoise and Rayleigh air scatter, are not issues.\n8  Roughness Measurement s\n8. 1  Parameters\n8. 1.1\nR\nq\nand  R\na\nare  generally  used  fo r  silicon  wafer\nsurfaces.    Other  roughness  measurement  parameters\nmay also prove useful.  This guideline does not suggest\nwhich  parameters  to  use,  rather  it  suggests  how  to\nincorporate    any    parameter    into    a    standardized\nmeasurement specification.\n8. 2\nMeasurement Sites\n8. 2.1\nRoughness can vary considera bly across a wafer\nsurface.    It  may  also  have  a  preferential  direction  or\nanisotropy,  often  called  \u201clay\u201d  (ASME  B46.1).    Many\nmeasurement  techniques  are  limited  to  a  very  small\nmeasurement  area  and  to  one  or  two  scan  directions.\nTherefore   specific   measurement   patterns   must   be\ndefined   to   obtain   representative   and   reproducible\nresults.    These  patterns  should  correspond  to  effects\nobserved  on  wafers  in  different  manufacturing  steps.\nThese processing steps can generate features on a wafer\nsurface with rotational symmetries ranging from mirror\nto infinite.  The wafer slicing process may produce low\nsymmetry,  while  single-wafer  polishing  can  produce\nhigh symmetry.\n8. 2.2\nIn  cases  where  only  a  small  nu mber  of  spots  is\nmeasured, the spot pattern and the scan orientation have\nto  be  identified.    See  Figure  1  for  some  patterns  and\norientations;   others   may   be   agreed   upon   between\ninterested parties.\n8. 3\nSite Patterns\n8. 3.1\nOne-point  \u2014  This  can  be  usef ul  for  rapidly\nreviewing results of a quantity of wafers.  This is often\nat the wafer centerpoint.\n8. 3.2\nIn  applications  where  only  a  sm all  number  of\nlocations are to be measured, the pattern and orientation\nof the local scans have to be identified.  Measurements\nare performed at locations as outlined in Figure 1.  For\neach    local    scan,    a    representative    roughness    is\ncalculated.    The  wafer\u2019s  representative  roughness  is\nthen  a  function  of  the  n  individual  representative  scan\nvalues.    The  roughness  variation  can  be  calculated  by\nthe average, the standard deviation, the maximum or the\nrange  (Max-Min)  of  the  individual  scan  values.    Other\nstatistical approaches may be employed.\n8. 3.3\nStandard patterns include:\na.\n1-pointWafer center,\nb.\n5-pointWafer  Center  plus  four  points  at  2r/3\nfrom the wafer center, and\nc.\n9-pointWafer  Center  plus  four  points  at  2r/5\nand four at 4r/5 from the wafer center.\nNOTE 4: These patterns have been shown to be useful with a\nrange of symmetries and values.  See Related Information.\n8. 3.4     Standard    measurement    orienta tion    patterns\ninclude:\na.\nType  A  -  linear  scans  parallel  and  perpendicular\nto the fiducial bisector, and\nb.\nType  B  -  linear  scans  at  45\no\nrelative  to  the\nfiducial bisector.\nNOTE  5:  Type  A  is  generally  used  for  all  surfaces.

Therefore  a  systematic,  standardized\napproach  is  required  for  defining  the  roughness  of  the\nentire  surface  of  a  silicon  wafer.    This  can  be  done  by\ndefining  one  or  several  patterns  of  measurement  spots\nwhich  represent  the  entire  surface  so  that  the  deviation\nof  the  average  roughness  and  its  standard  deviation\nfrom  the  \u201ctrue\u201d  values  are  small.    The  task  of  finding\nsuch patterns and verifying that they represent the entire\nsurface    was    approached    in    two    steps:    1.        by\ninvestigating various patterns on various wafer surfaces\nexperimentally, and 2. by simulating the roughness map\nof  surfaces  and  by  applying  the  selected  patterns  to\nthem.\nR1-1.2    Five  different  site  patterns  were  used  for  the\nexperimental  investigation  of  silicon  wafer  surfaces\nwhich  were  final  polished,  stock  removal  polished  and\nacid  etched.  The  patterns  consist  of  one,  five,  nine,  ten\nand thirteen points (thirteen being the sum of a five and\nnine point pattern), respectively, and the measurements\nwere  performed  with  10,  30,  80  and  250  \u03bcm  filter\nlengths.    Therefore  20  average  roughness  values  and\ncorresponding  standard  deviations  were  obtained  for\nevery wafer investigated, five for any filter length.\nR1-1.3  Haze maps of these surfaces either displayed no\nvariation,  variations  with  an  approximately  rotational\nsymmetry or a gradient across the surface, respectively.\nThe  average  roughness  of  the  surfaces  measured  with\nthe  various  site  patterns  varied  over  four  and  a  half\norders  of  magnitude  for  the  set  of  wafers  used  and  the\nfilter  settings  selected.    The  corresponding  standard\ndeviations  were  found  to  be  <10%  of  the  average\nroughness  with  the  exception  of  four  200  mm  final\npolished  wafers  where  standard  deviations  up  to  50-\n60%  occurred.    The  5-,  9-  and  10-point  site  patterns\nwere  compared  with  respect  to  the  average  roughness\nand  the  corresponding  standard  deviation  for  every\nwafer.      The   variation   (standard   deviation)   of   the\naverage   roughness   and   the   standard   deviations   as\nmeasured    were    found    to    be    smaller    than    or\napproximately 10% in any case when normalized to the\ntotal  average  roughness  of  the  corresponding  wafer\n(average over all points of all patterns for a wafer).\nR1-1.4      Roughness   maps   were   generated   for   the\nsimulation  according  to  three  different  models:  maps\nwith a roughness pattern with rotational symmetry, with\na linear gradient and with mirror symmetry.  Two maps\nwith  a  pixel  size  of  1  mm\n2\nwere  generated  for  each\nsurface  to  take  into  account  any  anisotropy  of  the\nroughness,  and  center  roughness  and  edge  roughness,\nrespectively,  were  used  as  free  parameters  for  both\nmaps.  These parameters were varied between two level\n(0.1  and  0.2)  for  both  maps  resulting  in  a  2\n5\nfactorial\ndesign   of   \u201cexperiment\u201d   where   the   symmetry   was\nconsidered as 5\nth\nparameter.  The 1-, 5- and 9-point site\npatterns  were  applied  to  the  various  maps  and  the\naverage roughness and standard deviation of roughness\nwere  calculated  as  well  as  the  true  values  using  all\npoints  of  a  map.    Strong  effects  were  observed  for  the\n1-point  pattern.    As  expected  one  point  in  the  wafer\ncenter   does   in   general   not   represent   the   average\nroughness of the entire surface reasonably well.  The 5-\npoint  measurement  provides  the  correct  average  \xb1  6%,\nthe  9-point  measurement  is  \xb1  2.5%.    Similarly,  the  5-\npoint  standard  deviation  is  correct  \xb1  1.6%  and  the  9-\npoint one is \xb1 1%.  Second order effects were found to\nbe  smaller  than  the  main  effects.    Therefore  it  is\nconcluded   that   the   suggested   five   and   nine   point\nmeasurement  patterns  provide  a  good  estimate  of  the\nroughness  of  an  entire  surface  and  its  variations  for\nreasonably homogeneous Si wafer surfaces.\nR1-2  Introduction\nR1-2.1      Roughness   measurement   of   surfaces   is\nperformed   with   a   variety   of   techniques,   the   most\ncommon  ones  being  mechanical  or  optical  profiling  in\nreal space or light scattering in reciprocal space (1,2,3).\nThe   numerical   result   of   a   roughness   measurement\nprocess  depends  significantly  on  several  parameters\nsuch  as  spatial  bandwidth  of  the  response  function  of\nthe  tool  used  including  filtering,  scan  length,  probe\ndiameter, scanning speed etc.  These parameters are not\nindependent  of  each  other  and  have  been  standardized\nonly  for  mechanical  profilers  (e.g.4,5).    The  roughness\nvalues  reported  by  different  types  of  tools  usually  do\nnot  agree  but  they  correlate  provided  their  parameters\nwere  set  up  not  too  differently  (6).    The  standardized\nroughness  metrics  such  as  average  roughness  R\na\nor\nroot-mean-square  roughness  R\nq\nrefer  mainly  to  line\nscans  as  performed  by  profiling  techniques  (e.g.  7).\nArea  scans  performed  by  profiling  tools  by  aligning  a\nseries of line scans are usually very slow.

Their  response  function,\nhowever,   has   a   limited   spatial   bandwidth   ranging\napproximately  from  0.5  to  40  \u03bcm.    Standards  for  light\nscattering measurements are now emerging (8,9).\nR1-2.3        The    obvious    solution    for    obtaining    a\nstandardized  roughness  value  of  an  entire  surface  is  a)\nto   define   a   pattern   of   sites   where   one-   or   two-\ndimensional  scans  are  performed  and  b)  to  report  the\nsignificant   parameters   along   with   the   measurement\n(roughness)   result.   The   second   task   can   be   solved\ntheoretically by collecting the important parameters and\nby  designing  an  appropriate  abbreviation  code.

Most  widely  used  are  average  roughness\nR\na\nand  root-mean-square  roughness  R\nq\n.    Both  refer  to\nthe average deviation of a profile from a reference line.\nR1-4  Roughness Measurements\nR1-4.1  Experimental Details\nR1-4.1.1      Four   groups   of   four   wafers   each   were\ninvestigated   to   collect   data   about   the   variation   of\nroughness  across  the  wafer  surface.  The  wafers  were\nselected   to   represent   different   process   steps   and\npolishing techniques:\na)\nfinal polished wafers, 150 mm, #1-4\nb)\nfinal polished wafers, 200 mm, #4-8\nc)\npre-polished wafers, 200 mm, #9-12\nd)\nacid-etched wafers, 200 mm, #13-16.\nR1-4.1.2    The  wafers  were  characterized  for  haze  with\nan    SSIS    (Censor    ANS-100)    and    the    roughness\nmeasurements  were  performed  with  an  optical  non-\ncontact profiler (Chapman MP-2000+).  The roughness\ndata  were  taken  by  performing  scans  of  length  3  mm\nand  were  evaluated  using  filters  of  19,  30,  80  and  250\n\u03bcm,  respectively.    The  scans  were  performed  at  a\nvariety  of  sites  according  to  four  different  site  patterns\nas displayed in Figure R1-1 where also the directions of\nthe various scans are indicated:\ni)center of wafer, one scan\nii)    five points, center of wafer plus four points at 2/3\nof radius\niii)   nine points, center of wafer plus four points at 2/5\nof radius plus four points at 4/5 of radius\niv)   ten points, two in the center of wafer plus four\npoints at \xbd of radius and four points at radius\nminus 10 mm.\nv)    thirteen points, combination of pattern ii and iii.\nFigure R1-1\nSite Patterns"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M40-0200 \xa9 SEMI 200015\nR1-4.2  Results\nR1-4.2.1    The  average  values  of  each  site  pattern  is  reported  here  together  with  the  corresponding  standard\ndeviation.    The  average  might  be  considered  as  the  characteristic  roughness  of  the  entire  surface  whereas  the\nstandard deviation is a measure of roughness inhomogeneity.  The results are summarized in Tables R1-1 and R1-3.\nThese  averages  and  standard  deviations  are  called  site  average  or  site  standard  deviation  for  the  respective  site\npatterns for each wafer and each filter length applied.\nR1-4.2.2    The  variation  in  average  values  obtained  with  the  different  site  patterns  employed  can  be  obtained  by\ncalculating 1) the average ofthe individual site averages and the standard deviation for each wafer and 2) the average\nof the individual site standard deviations and the corresponding standard deviation.  These averages are called wafer\naverage  and  wafer  standard  deviation,  respectively.    The  corresponding  standard  deviations  are  called  standard\ndeviation of wafer average and standard deviation of wafer standard deviation.  They are reported in Table R1-3 and\nTable R1-5 and in Figure R1-2 and Figure R1-3.\nR1-4.2.3    The  site  average  roughness  values  found  range  from  0.09  A  for  final  polished  wafers  to  350  A  for  acid\netched wafers for a 10 \u03bcm filter and from about 5 A to 2200 A, respectively, for a 250 \u03bcm filter. In total, a range of\nabout  four  and  a  half  orders  of  magnitude  is  covered.    The  site  standard  deviation  for  the  different  site  patterns  is\naround  10-15%  of  the  average  roughness  of  the  wafer  indicating  a  homogeneous  roughness  of  the  wafer  surfaces.\nThe  difference  between  the  site  patterns  ii,  iii,  iv  and  v  for  the  relative  site  standard  deviation  is  small,  typically\nabout 1-2 %.  Exceptions are for the 200 mm final polished wafers with standard deviations of about 50-60% for the\n10 \u03bcm filter.\nR1-4.2.4  According to the values in Tables R1-3 & R1-5, the standard deviations of the wafer averages are less than\n10 % in any case (Figure RI).  The standard deviations of the various site standard deviations (Figure A3) are also\nsmaller than or about 10 % with respect to the wafer average.  This indicates that in the present case any site pattern\n\u2014with  the  exception  of  the  single  site  measurement  at  the  wafer  center\u2014represents  the  \u201ctrue\u201d  mean  roughness

Therefore  approximations\nhave  to  be  found  which  represent  the  roughness  of  an\nentire  wafer  surface  with  appropriate  accuracy.    Three\ndiscrete site patterns were defined in section 9 of SEMI\nM40,     which     are     thought     to     provide     such\napproximations.  Performing many measurements using\nthese  site  patterns  is  one  approach  to  assess  these  site\npatterns   with   respect   to   their   validity.      Another\napproach  is  to  simulate  roughness  variations  across  a\nwafer surface and apply the site patterns to them.  This\nallows  easy  and  systematic  variations  of  the  surface\nroughness properties and maps.  The assessment of the\nresults  again  has  to  be  performed  in  a  systematic  way.\nAn appropriate tool for doing this is to utilize a factorial\ndesign  for  the  variables  in  the  various  surface  models\nused.      The   goal   of   finding   a   site   pattern   which\nrepresents   the   entire   surface   is   considered   to   be\nachieved  when  the  variations  of  the  variables  of  the\ndifferent   surface   models   result   in   a   non-significant\neffect in the evaluation of the factorial design.\nR1-5.2  Simulation of Roughness Maps\nR1-5.2.1    The  measurement  results  that  are  reported  in\nsection  3  provide  some  insight  into  the  variation  of\nroughness   that   occurs   across   actual,   typical   wafer\nsurfaces.      The   variation   observed   on   the   different\nwafers  is  related  to  the  specific  polishing  technique\n(wax  mount  polishing,  wax  free  polishing)  and  to  the\npolishing  parameters  used.    Examination  of  haze  maps\nreveals three basic patterns of variation:\na)\na circularly symmetric haze variation\nb)\na haze variation approximately symmetric with\nrespect to a diameter across the wafer\nc)\na linear gradient of haze from one wafer edge to\nthe opposite one.\nR1-5.2.2  The following relations were used to simulate\nthe variation of roughness according to these three basic\nmodels  a)-c)  with  e  and  c  being  the  roughness  values\nnear the edge and at the center of a wafer, respectively:\nmodel a: a parabolic relation\nz(x,y) = (x\n2\n+y\n2\n) (e-c)/r\n2"),(0,i.yg)("ul",null,(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"c                     (equ. 1)\nmodel b: a semi-cylindrical relation\nz(x,y) = (r\n2\n-(y cos a \u2013 x sin a)\n2\n)\n1/2\n(e-c)/r + e\n(equ. 2)\nmodel c: a linear gradient\nz(x,y) = (y cos a - x sin a) (e-c)/r + c       (equ. 3)\nwith  wafer  radius  r  and  angle  \u03b1  corresponding  to  the\nangle  between  the  symmetry  plane  and  the  x-direction\n(model  b)  or  the  direction  of  the  gradient  and  the  y-\ndirection (model c).\nR1-5.2.3    Using  equations  1-3,  roughness  maps  of\nwafer surfaces can be generated with a roughness value\nassigned  to  each  site.    This  was  performed  by  using\nMathCad\xae  software  and  by  assuming  200  mm  wafers,\nthe  area  of  each  being  partitioned  into  sites  of  1  mm\n2\nsize.\nR1-5.2.4    Roughness  is  not  necessarily  an  isotropic\nproperty of a surface.

The parameters of the models \u2013 roughness\nin the center and near the edge of the wafer \u2013 were used as variables in a factorial design and varied between two\nlevels.  Average roughness and the corresponding standard deviations calculated for the site patterns were compared\nwith the \u201ctrue\u201d values obtained by evaluating all points of the roughness map.\nR1-5.4.2  The patterns where the roughness is measured at five or nine points exhibit a standard deviation of 7 and 5\n%,  respectively,  from  the  true  average  value  for  all  possible  combinations  of  the  variables.    The  average  of  the\nstandard deviations of the roughness distribution of the single variable sets differs by about 13% from the true value\nfor  the  five-  as  well  as  nine-point  site  pattern.    A  standard  deviation  of  the  standard  deviations  of  about  11%  is\nobtained by averaging over the 32 different variables sets.\nR1-5.4.3  The evaluation of the factorial design outlines that the variation of the variables c1, c2, e1, and e2 has a\nsignificant effect \u2013 with respect to \u201cnoise\u201d \u2013 on the average roughness values but not on the corresponding standard\ndeviations.    Varying  the  surface  model  does  not  significantly  affect  the  averages  and  standard  deviations.    Some\nsecond  order  effects  or  interactions  are  also  significant  but  less  pronounced  than  the  main  effects.    A  pronounced\ninteraction  of  the  variables  c1  and  c2  occurs  e.g.  for  the  five  point  standard  deviation  rstdabw5.    This  interaction\ncould  be  reduced  by  introducing  an  additional  site  for  measuring  roughness  in  the  center  of  the  wafer  with  a\ndirection perpendicular to the present one.\nR1-5.4.4  The goal of finding a site pattern which results only in non-significant effects is not completely achieved\nby  the  five  and  nine  point  patterns  utilized  in  the  present  work.    However,  they  allow  to  measure  the  average\nroughness of wide variety of surface roughness distributions with a one sigma deviation of 5-7 %, or a three sigma\ndeviation of 15-21 %.
