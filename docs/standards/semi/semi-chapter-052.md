SEMI E88-1104E © SEMI 1999, 2004 56 R1-4 Stocker Command Scheduling CharacteristicsR1-4.1 At a minimum, the SC must offer Priority-based First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queuing of TRANSFERcommands. In other words, all TRANSFER commands which have yet to be processed by the SC must be servicedin the order in which they are received by the SC based on the priority given in the host command. The minimumpriority levels required to be available on Stocker SEM equipment are Normal and High (refer to Figure R1-4for an example). Normal and High priorities will be denoted by U2 compatible numbers as per the definition ofthe priority in the Variable Data and Remote Command sections of this document. Other options may beimplemented, but to be a Stocker SEM equipment it must at a minimum have the ability to be configured to performPriority-based FIFO queuing of TRANSFER commands. Additionally, the command priorities are to be utilizedduring execution of the commands to the following level: any High priority command will cause all othercommands that are not High priority to be usurped. That is to say that all other commands will modify theexecution steps to allow the High priority commands to be completed in the minimal elapsed time possible.Multiple High priority commands will act upon each other according to the same rules as Normal commands acton each other.

SEMI E90-0705 © SEMI 1999, 20051 SEMI E90-0705SPECIFICATION FOR SUBSTRATE TRACKING This specification was technically approved by the global Information & Control Committee. This editionwas approved for publication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on April 7, 2005. It wasavailable at www.semi.org in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005. Originally publishedSeptember 1999; previously published March 2004. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this standard is to provide the standard services of equipment to track substrates (manufacturedproduct) in manufacturing equipment. This standard defines the concepts and behaviors for the informationmanagement of substrates, as well as the messages/services. 2 Scope2.1 Essentially, information about substrates must be managed by the factory system, while the equipment isrequired to provide the services for the substrate information management. This standard addresses the requirementfor the equipment services to manage information of substrates that reside in the equipment.2.2 The scope of this standard is to define the information services of equipment that can be requested by the user.To clarify required services, the concepts and behaviors of the substrate, the substrate location, the batch and thebatch location are defined.2.3 This standard is applicable to any manufacturing equipment that handles substrates. To implement theseservices, the equipment and factory system must be integrated by means of a communication link.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This standard assumes that the substrate(s) to be managed has been resident in the equipment and has beengiven a substrate identifier.3.2 The service for a substrate is valid while the substrate is registered in the equipment. That is, the service isavailable from the moment that the substrate is registered into the equipment and, to the moment that the substrate isremoved from the equipment.3.3 This standard is only for information services. It does not address any mechanism to read or write informationfrom/to the substrate. 4 Referenced Standards and Documents4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E30  Generic Model for Communications and Control of Manufacturing Equipment (GEM)SEMI E39  Object Services Standard: Concepts, Behavior, and ServicesSEMI E53  Event ReportingSEMI E87  Specification for Carrier Management (CMS)NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 batch  a group of substrates to be processed in a process resource simultaneously.5.1.2 batch location  locations in the equipment where substrates visit as a group of substrates for storage orprocessing.

Theoutline of this convention is described in an attachment of SEMI E30. The official definition of this convention isdescribed in Statecharts: A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems written by D. Harel in Science of ComputerProgramming 8, 1987.1 6.1.2 A transition table is used with the state chart for clearly describing the character of each state transition. Thetable contains the folllowing: a transition number, current state, trigger, new state, and operation in transition.6.1.3 The state models included in this standard are a requirement for Substrate Tracking compliance. A statemodel consists of a state model diagram, state definitions, and a state transition table. When using collection events,all state transitions in this standard, unless otherwise specified, shall correspond to collection events.6.1.4 A state model represents the hosts view of the equipment and does not necessarily describe the internalequipment operation. When using collection events, all Substrate Tracking state model transitions shall be mappedsequentially into the appropriate internal equipment collection events that satisfy the requirements of thosetransitions. In certain implementations, the equipment may enter a state and have already satisfied all of theconditions required by the Substrate Tracking state models for transition to another state. In this case, the equipmentmakes the required transition without any additional actions.6.2 OMT Object Information Model6.2.1 The object models are represented using the Object Modeling Technique (OMT) developed by Rumbaugh,James, et al, in Object Oriented Modeling Design, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1991.2 6.2.2 An overview of this notation is provided in the Appendix 1 of SEMI E39.6.3 Object Attributes Representation6.3.1 The object information model for standardized objects will be supported by an attribute definition table withthe following column headings: Attribute Name Definition Access Reqmt FormatThe formal text name of the attributes. Description ofinformation contained.RO or RW Y or N Refer to the descriptionbelow. 6.3.1.1 The Access column uses RO (read only) or RW (read/write) to indicate the access that a service user has tothe attribute.6.3.1.2 A Y or N in the Requirement (Reqmt) column indicates if this attribute must be supported in order tomeet the fundamental requirement for the service.6.3.1.3 The Format column is used for showing the data type of the attribute.

SEMI E90-0705 © SEMI 1999, 2005 4 6.4 Service Message Representation6.4.1 Service Resource Definition  A service resource definition table defines the specific sets of messages for aservice group, as shown in the following table: Message Service Name Type DescriptionMessage name N or R Purpose of the service. 6.4.1.1 Type can be either N = Notification or R = Request. Notification type messages are initiated by a serviceprovider and the provider does not expect to get the response from the service user or requester.6.4.1.2 Request messages are initiated by a service user or requester. The Request message asks for data or anactivity from the provider. Request messages expect a specific response message (no presumption on the messagecontext).6.4.2 Service Parameter Dictionary  A service parameter dictionary table defines the parameters for one or moreservices, as shown in the following table: Parameter Form DescriptionParameter X Data type The parameter called X is B in A. 6.4.2.1 A row is provided in the table for each parameter of the service. The first column contains the name of theparameter. This is followed by columns describing form and contents of the corresponding primitive.6.4.2.2 The Form column is used to indicate the type of data contained in a parameter. (See 5.2 for definitions.)6.4.2.3 The Description column in the Service Parameter Dictionary table describes the meaning of the parameter,the values it can assume, and any interrelationships with other parameters.6.4.2.4 To prevent the definition of numerous parameters named XxxList, this document adopts the convention ofreferring to the list as (List of) Xxxx. In this case, the definition of the variable Xxx will be given, not of the list.The term list indicates a collection (or set) of zero or more items of the same data type. Where a list is used inboth the request and the response, the list order in the request is retained in the response. A list must contain at leastone element unless zero elements are specifically allowed.6.4.3 Service Message Definition  A service message definition table defines the parameter used in a service, asshown in the following table: Parameter Req/Ind Rsp/Conf DescriptionParameter X see below see below A description of the service. 6.4.3.1 The columns labeled Req/Ind and Rsp/Conf link the parameters to the direction of the message. Themessage sent by the initiator is called the Request. The receiver terms this message the Indication. The receivermay then send a Response, which the original sender terms the Confirmation.6.4.3.2 The following codes appear in the Req/Ind and Rsp/Conf columns, and are used in the definition of theparameters (e.g., how each parameter is used in each direction):M  Mandatory Parameter  must be given a valid value.C  Conditional Parameter  may be defined in some circumstances and undefined in others. Whether a valueis given may be completely optional or may depend on the values of other parameters.U  User-Defined Parameter-  The parameter is not used.= (for response only) Indicates that the value of this parameter in the response shall match the value in theprimary (if defined).

SEMI E90-0705 © SEMI 1999, 20055 7 Overview7.1 Purpose of Substrate Tracking7.1.1 Substrate tracking consists of the following capabilities, as described below:7.1.2 Substrate Location Tracking  Substrate Location Tracking provides the capability to determine the currentlocation of substrates in the equipment. The indication of the substrate location will help the user to understand theenvironment to which the substrate is exposed in the equipment.7.1.3 Batch Location Tracking  Batch Location Tracking provides the capability to determine the current locationof a group of substrates in the equipment. Typical example of a substrates group is a batch in batch processequipment.7.1.4 Substrate History Record  Substrate History Record provides the capability to read the history of substratesin the equipment. The user can inquire about the history of a particular substrate, substrate location, or batch locationwith substrate position in a batch. A history includes the series of locations that the substrate has visited in theequipment.7.1.5 Substrate Process Tracking  Substrate Process Tracking provides the capability of tracking currentsubstrate processing state. For example, the user may determine whether a substrate is processed or not byrequesting its state when the process has been completed abnormally. The user may use the state transitions totrigger wafer level data collection.7.2 View of Substrate Tracking7.2.1 Figure 1 shows the view of Substrate Tracking using the OMT representation. It is assumed that substrates areavailable before usage of the services. Substrate carriers may or may not be used to load the substrates to theequipment. Substrates are loaded into the equipment and travel through substrate locations and batch locations. Theequipment must maintain all information necessary to track substrates in the equipment.7.3 Substrate Location and Batch Location7.3.1 A substrate location is a discrete position that can hold a substrate in the equipment. This document will notdefine where the substrate location exists. Substrate locations shall be determined by the design of equipment andthe applications. For example, to track the order of process chambers that is applied to a substrate process in a multi-chamber single wafer process equipment, it is appropriate to designate process chambers for substrate locations. Onthe other hand, in batch process equipment, process chambers are designated for batch locations and substratelocations are not used to track the order of process chambers that is applied to the substrates of a batch. All substratelocations shall be documented by the equipment supplier.7.3.2 Batch Location indicates the physical location of a group of substrates (e.g., batch) on the equipment.Generally in batch process equipment, Batch Location is assigned to a process chamber and changed when a batch istransferred from one chamber to another. Individual substrate positions in a batch (e.g., slot positions of a batchcontainer or a process carrier) might be informed with Batch Location. Batch Locations and notation of thesubstrate positions in a batch are defined and documented by the equipment supplier.7.3.3 Figure 2 shows the concept of the substrate location using OMT representation.

A CarrierLocation may hold a carrier, a Substrate Location may hold a substrate, and a Batch Location may hold a group ofsubstrates. Typical example of a substrates group is a batch in batch process equipment.7.3.5 Substrate Location is classified into Equipment Substrate Location and Carrier Substrate Location. Carrier hasCarrier Substrate Locations. A Carrier Substrate Location is the location which can hold a substrate in a carrier. AnEquipment Substrate Location is the location which can hold a substrate on the equipment resource.7.3.6 Substrate travels on substrate locations and/or batch locations.

SEMI E90-0705 © SEMI 1999, 20057 7.4 Identification of Substrate7.4.1 Substrate shall be identified by substrate ID. There are options for assigning substrate ID to a substrate. When a carrier is used for loading substrates and the carrier is given its carrier ID, substrate IDs can be obtainedby utilizing the carrier ID and carrier substrate location. This standard will define the requirement for thesubstrate ID assignment to the substrates in a carrier. Substrate ID may be read from the substrate directly by a substrate ID reader. The substrate ID read from thesubstrate can be used for the identification. Substrate ID may be assigned by the user (i.e., host or operator). The substrate ID can be used for theidentification. This standard will define the service for registering substrates.7.4.2 The recommendation of a particular option for assigning substrate IDs is not within the scope of this standard.It must be selected based on the equipment design and applications. 8 Substrate Tracking Requirement8.1 Compliance to Substrate Tracking Service (STS) requires that an implementation also provide certaincapabilities that are defined in other standards. STS requires compliance to SEMI E39 (OSS) for Substrate objects. The attributes of these objects may beaccessed through use of the GetAttr and SetAttr services. STS requires an event reporting capability. This capability may be satisfied by the Event Reporting capability inSEMI E30 (GEM) or by SEMI E53 (ERS).8.2 STS compliant equipment must implement capabilities defined in the following sections of this document: 9, Substrate Object Definition, 10, Substrate Location Object Definition, 12, Substrate Tracking Services, 13, Variable Data, if SEMI E53 is not implemented, and 11, Batch Location Object Definition, is an optional requirement.8.3 When the equipment provides a substrate reader, the equipment shall implement an equipment constant to allowthe host to choose between using or not using this capability. The equipment constant: SubstrateReaderEnabled isused to choose whether or not the equipment performs the reading of the substrate and use the Substrate ReadingStatus state model. The equipment is responsible for creating the substrate objects. The substrate ID assigned to thesubstrate object is the same as the one provided by the host in the ContentMap attribute or created by the equipmentusing the following rule when the SubstID in the content map is not provided. The default substrate ID shall berepresented in text as the carrierID, a period and the substrate slot location. For example, if CarrierID = xyz andsubstrate slot location = 5, then the substrate ID would be = xyz.05.8.4 All state transitions defined for the three state models specified in this document must be reportable via discretecollection events as defined in 6.1, Harel State Model. The three state models are the Substrate Object State Model(Figure 3), the Substrate Location State Model (Figure 4) and the Batch Location State Model (Figure 5).8.4.1 The data in Table 15 (Variables Required for Substrate Object State Model Transitions) is required to beavailable for the Substrate Object State Model transition collection events. Fixed buffer equipment must supportdiscrete state transitions for Substrate. Internal buffer equipment must support related state transitions that occur fora group of Substrate objects. An equipment may support both discrete and related state transitions for Substrate.8.4.2 The data in Table 16 (Variables Required for Substrate Location Object State Model Transitions) is requiredto be available for the Substrate Location Object State Model transition collection events.8.4.3 The data in Table 17 (Variables Required for Batch Location Object State Model Transitions) is required to beavailable for the Batch Location Object State Model transition collection events.

SEMI E90-0705 © SEMI 1999, 2005 8 8.5 Each Substrate Object instantiated on the equipment must maintain an independent instance of the SubstrateObject State Model. When discrete and unrelated state transitions occur for Substrate Object models, each shalltrigger a separate collection event. However, when related state transitions occur for a group of Substrate Objectmodels (such as with internal buffer equipment material transfers), each model does not trigger a separate collectionevent. Instead, a single collection event shall be triggered (for all related Substrate Objects in the group). The dataitems defined in Table 15 are required to be valid for collection events triggered by state model transitions in thefollowing way:8.5.1 These variables from Table 15 must be valid for collection events triggered by discrete state transitions: AcquiredID (equipment with substrate ID readers only) SubstID SubstIDStatus (equipment with substrate ID readers only) SubstBatchLocID (batch process equipment only) SubstDestination SubstHistory SubstSubstLocID SubstLotID SubstMtrlStatus SubstPosInBatch (batch process equipment only) SubstProcState SubstSource SubstState SubstType SubstUsage8.5.2 These variables from Table 15 must be valid for collection events triggered by a group of related statetransitions: AcquiredIDList (equipment with substrate ID readers only) SubstIDList SubstIDStatusList (equipment with substrate ID readers only) SubstBatchLocIDList (batch process equipment only) SubstDestinationList SubstHistoryList SubstLocIDList SubstLotIDList SubstMtrlStatusList SubstPosInBatchList (batch process equipment only) SubstProcStateList SubstSourceList SubstStateList

Each Substrate Location Object shall trigger a separatecollection event for each state transition. The data items defined in Table 16 are required to be valid for collectionevents triggered by each state model transition.8.7 Each Batch Location Object instantiated on the equipment must maintain an independent instance of the BatchLocation Object State Model. Each Batch Location Object shall trigger a separate collection event for each statetransition. The data items defined in Table 17 are required to be valid for collection events triggered by each statemodel transition. 9 Substrate Object Definition9.1 A substrate is a base upon which a product unit is built in the manufacturing equipment. Wafers and flat paneldisplays are examples of substrates. A substrate may be associated with a lot, which the factory uses for trackingpurposes.9.1.1 The substrate object shall be created when the substrate is registered by the equipment. There are twopossible ways of registering the substrate.(1) The substrate is registered by the equipment when the information for the carrier containing the substrate isregistered. The information required to create a substrate object must be provided with the carrier. However, thespecification of carrier management services is outside the scope of this standard. Substrate Trackingimplementations shall be consistent with the Carrier Management standard. For instance, if the Carrier Managementstandard specifies the method of identifying the substrates in a carrier, then Substrate Tracking shall recognize thoseidentifiers.(2) The substrate is registered when the substrate is transferred directly (not in a carrier) to the equipment by theCreate service defined in SEMI E39 to inform the equipment of this event.9.2 Substrate Object State Model9.2.1 A substrate has both a state indicating where it is located and a state indicating the progress of processing.These states are represented by the SUBSTRATE TRANSPORT and the SUBSTRATE PROCESSING states,which are concurrent substates of the SUBSTRATE State Model shown in Figure 3.9.2.2 If the equipment provides a mechanism for reading substrates, then, the equipment shall include a state modelin parallel with the Substrate Transport and Substrate Processing States called Substrate Reading Status SeeFigure 3 and Table 1 for additional requirements.9.3 Substrate Object State Definitions9.3.1 ABORTED  The process has been aborted during the processing. The substrate will require specialtreatment.9.3.2 AT DESTINATION  The substrate has been placed at its designated destination substrate location. Thesubstrate may have been placed at a carrier substrate location when the carrier is used to unload the substrate fromthe equipment, or at an equipment substrate location when the substrate is to be removed by itself from theequipment.9.3.3 AT SOURCE  The state which the substrate is originally received. The substrate is held at carrier substratelocation when a carrier is used to supply the substrate.9.3.4 AT WORK  The substrate has been taken from the original substrate location or destination substratelocation, and is traveling on intermediate equipment substrate locations. The substrate has been taken out of thecarrier and placed into the equipment when a carrier is used to supply the substrate.

Each SLO on anequipment is assigned a substrate location ID to uniquely identify it. The assignment shall be documented by theequipment supplier. There are two types of substrate locations: carrier substrate location, which is the location orposition (e.g., slot) in the carrier, and equipment substrate location, which is on the equipment resource. Theequipment substrate location is a persistent object, while the carrier substrate locations are dynamic objects that shallbe created or deleted by the placement or removal of carriers on the equipment.10.1.1 Source substrate locations and Destination substrate locations are the points at which substrates transferto/from the equipments internal substrate locations (often locations at which processing occurs). A carrier substratelocation is the Source or Destination substrate location when a carrier is used to transfer the substrate. An equipmentsubstrate location can be the Source or Destination substrate location when the substrate is transferred directly(without a carrier).10.2 Substrate Location State ModelFigure 4 shows the dynamic behavior of the substrate location using the Harel state chart representation. © UNOCCUPIED OCCUPIED SUBSTRATE LOCATION 1 2 Figure 4Dynamic Behavior Model of Substrate LocationA-1.1.1.210.3 Substrate Location State Definitions10.3.1 SUBSTRATE LOCATION  the superstate of UNOCCUPIED and OCCUPIED.10.3.2 UNOCCUPIED  the state in which the substrate location does not hold or have a substrate.10.3.3 OCCUPIED  the state in which the substrate location holds a substrate.10.4 Substrate Location State TransitionTable 4 Substrate Location State Model Transition TableNo. Current State Trigger New State Action Comment1 UNOCCUPIED Substrate moves onto the substrate location.

On some equipment (atthe option of the equipment designer), substrate objects may also be registered (created) at the equipment throughthe host-initiated Create service defined in SEMI E39. Equipment is not required to provide host-initiated Register(Create) Substrate or Remove Substrate services for fundamental compliance to STS. Table 8 defines the attributesettings that may be initialized through this service.12.1.2 In general, it depends on the application whether or not attributes are initialized by the user of the createservice. In some situation, it may be necessary to match the new substrate with a location, for example, while inother situations it would be unnecessary.

This related information was approved forpublication by full letter ballot procedures on January 14, 2000.R1-1 Substrate State Model ImplementationR1-1.1 The Substrate Object State Model defined in 9.1 is a generic representation of the substrate object statemodel that includes standard transitions for various equipment types.R1-1.2 Some equipment may not be able to implement all of the transitions defined in this model. For example, thetransition from AT WORK to AT SOURCE (Transition Number 3) represents the case where the substrate returns tothe original (source) location, typically for further processing. If the equipment is unable to implement this return,then the transition would never occur, and it should be omitted from the implemented state model.R1-1.3 The state model shall be implemented based on the definition of the state model; however, substates andtransitions that cannot occur for a particular equipment design may be omitted where the model allows. R1-2 Example of Substrate Object State Model for Simple EquipmentR1-2.1 This section shows an example of Substrate Object State Model for simple equipment. (See Figure R1-1.)R1-2.2 The equipment transports the substrate only in a forward direction, so that the Substrate Transport Substatetakes straight forward transitions from AT SOURCE to AT WORK and then to AT DESTINATION. For example,the wirebonder removes leadframes from a magazine and carries them on a transport mechanism but is unable toreturn them to the magazine.R1-2.3 Also, the equipment processes the substrate only in forward steps so that the Substrate Processing Substatetakes straight forward transitions from NEED PROCESSING to IN PROCESS and then to PROCESSINGCOMPLETE. The REJECTED state is not applied to this equipment.

SEMI E91-0600 © SEMI 1999, 20001 SEMI E91-0600SPECIFICATION FOR PROBER SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL(PSEM) This specification was technically approved by the Global Information & Control Committee and is the directresponsibility of the Japanese Communications Committee. Current edition approved by the JapaneseRegional Standards Committee on January 14, 2000. Initially available at www.semi.org March 2000; to bepublished June 2000. Originally published September 1999. 1 Purpose1.1 This document establishes a S pecific EquipmentModel for prober equipment (PSEM). The PSEMconsists of equipment characteristics and behaviors thatapply to this class of equipment and are required to beimplemented in addition to the fundamentalrequirements and additional capabilities specified inSEMI E30 (GEM). The intent of this document is tofacilitate the integration of prober equipment into anautomated semiconductor factory. This documentaccomplishes this by defining an operational model forprober equipment as viewed by a factory automationcontroller. This definition provides a standard hostinterface and equipment operational behavior. 2 Scope2.1 The scope of this document is limited to thedefinition of prober equipment behavior as perceivedby a Semiconductor Equipment CommunicationsStandard (SECS-II) (SEMI E5) host that complies withGEM. The document defines the view of the equipmentthrough the SECS communications link, but does notdefine the internal operation of the equipment. Itincludes a specific processing state model as the basisfor the behavior of all equipment of this class.2.2 This document requires that th e GEM fundamentalrequirements and applicable additional capabilities havebeen implemented on the prober equipment. Thisdocument expands GEM Standard requirements andcapabilities in the areas of the processing state model,collection events, remote commands, data itemvariables and process program management, and addsProber Job state model to GEM Standard requirementsand capabilities. This document does not include thedefinition of the treatment of Multiple Stage.2.3 This document applies to the c lass of proberequipment in which the wafer is unloaded from thesame slot in the same carrier which loaded the waferafter processing.2.4 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E5  SEMI Equipment CommunicationsStandard 2 Message Content (SECS-II)SEMI E30  Generic Model for Communications andControl of Manufacturing Equipment (GEM)SEMI M20  Specification for Establishing a WaferCoordinate SystemSEMI M21  Specification for Assigning Addresses toRectangular Elements in a Cartesian Array 3.2 Other DocumentsHarel, D., Statechart: A Visual Formalism forComplex Systems, Science of Computer Programming8 (1987) 231-274.1 NOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 4 Terminology4.1 alignment  a procedure in w hich a coordinatesystem is established on a substrate.4.2 bin  categorized data of die as a result ofmeasurement.4.3 cassette  a physical object c ontaining one ormore substrate locations (see slot).

Astate model consists of a state model diagram, statedefinitions, and a state transitions table. A state modelrepresents the hosts view of the prober, but notnecessarily the actual prober operations. All PSEMstate model transitions shall be mapped sequentiallyinto the actual equipment events that satisfy therequirements of those transitions. In certainimplementations, the prober may enter a state and hasalready satisfied all of the conditions required by thePSEM state model for transition to another state. In thissituation, the prober makes the required transitionwithout any additional actions.5.1.1.1 Various symbols used in a stat e diagram aredescribed in Figure 1. a) State b) Transition c) Default Entry Point H d) History C e) Conditional Selector f) Terminator Figure 1Various Symbols Used in a State Diagram

SEMI E91-0600 © SEMI 1999, 2000 4 5.2.3 Description of Prober Process ing States5.2.3.1 ABORTING (PROCESSING A CTIVE Sub-state)  The prober has received ABORT command.All activities are suspended. The prober is taking anappropriate action to ensure possible safe state for theprober itself and materials. Wafer data or lot data maybe unavailable.5.2.3.2 ALARM PAUSED (PAUSE Su b-state)  Analarm has occurred in PROCESS or PROCESS PAUSEstate. The prober is waiting for the alarm to be cleared.5.2.3.3 CHECKING (PROCESS PAU SE Sub-state) The prober verifies that a process program updateperformed is valid. This is a procedure same with thattaken in SETTING UP state before the prober is readyto transit to READY state. Upon completion ofverification, an event will be created if the verificationis successfully ended. A transition is made to theprocess state, based on the process model conditiontable.5.2.3.4 EXECUTING (PROCESS Sub -state)  Theprober is processing material automatically and cancontinue to do so without external intervention. Thisstate may include interaction with the host or operator.5.2.3.5 IDLE  The prober is waiting for aninstruction. IDLE is free of ALARMS and errorconditions.5.2.3.6 IDLE with ALARMS  An ala rm has occurredin the IDLE state and the prober is waiting for allalarms to be cleared.5.2.3.7 INIT  Prober is in the course of initialization.5.2.3.8 MAINTENANCE5.2.3.8.1 The operators instruction has disabledproduction by the prober.5.2.3.8.2 Maintenance and inspection of the prober areexecuted in this state.5.2.3.9 PAUSE (PROCESSING ACTIV E Sub-state) PROCESS state is interrupted when the processing canbe paused. An action to ensure safety of the prober istaken. The prober waits for a command (RESUME,STOP or ABORT) or the alarm to be cleared. 5.2.3.10 PAUSED (PROCESS PAUSE Sub-state) In this state an operator can correct an error as far as thecurrent process program selection is not affected.PROCESS state is suspended and the prober waits for acommand (RESUME, STOP or ABORT). In this state,the operator is allowed to correct an error conditionsthat does not affect the current process programselected. One of such corrective actions that can betaken by the operator is manual alignment of the waferin process.5.2.3.11 PAUSED SETTING UP (PRO CESS PAUSESub-state)  When PROCESS state is suspended, theprober is made to perform simple set-up operations.Probe card replacing work and inker replacing work areincluded in those operations.5.2.3.12 PAUSING (PROCESS PAUSE Sub-state) PROCESS state is interrupted when the processing canbe paused. The prober cannot transit to PAUSED stateuntil safe state is ensured.5.2.3.13 PROCESS (PROCESSING AC TIVE Sub-state)  This state is the parent of those sub-states thatrefer to the preparation and execution of a processprogram.5.2.3.14 PROCESS PAUSE (PAUSE Su b-state) The prober is free of alarm conditions in the PAUSEstate.5.2.3.15 PROCESSING ACTIVE  Th e state in whichthe prober is processing materials.5.2.3.16 SETTING UP (PROCESS Sub -state)  Theprober is trying to satisfy requirements to be able tostart processing. This is the state under which theprober has already received a process program andmaterials to be processed, then has received STARTcommand from the host or the operator and is makingpreparation for the processing according to the processprogram.5.2.3.17 STOPPING (PROCESSING A CTIVE Sub-state)  The prober has received STOP command andsets up for the stop. All necessary cleanup is completedwithin this state with regard to material, data, controlsystem, etc. Data is preserved. Any error condition iscleared before exiting from this state.
