Figure 12Bottom View of FOSB 5.14 Retaining Features  Figure 13 and 14 show two features on the bottom of the FOSB that may be used forretaining the FOSB onto the kinematic couplings. Retaining features are option for the FOSB with manual door,however those are required for the FOSB with automated-shippable door. This may be needed to prevent the FOSBfrom being knocked off the kinematic couplings by the action of pushing the FOSB against the front-openinginterface. The front retaining feature contains a ramp that a wheel might roll up while the FOSB is being pushedtoward the front-opening interface. The arm with the wheel (not specified here) then holds the FOSB down on thekinematic couplings. The center retaining feature consists of an oblong slot with a chamber above it. The FOSB canbe clamped onto the kinematic couplings by inserting an oblong head on a shaft (not specified here) through the slotand rotating it 90° in either direction. Either retaining feature would only engage after the FOSB is fully seated onthe kinematic coupling pins. Either retaining feature must be able to withstand a force in any direction of at least f60.It is recommended that SEMI E15.1 tool load ports be designed to accommodate the minimum hole dimensions ofthe retaining features to ensure carrier interchangeability. Projections on the tool load ports that mate with theretaining features should also not interfere with the misalignment correction function of the kinematic couplings.5.15 Sensing Pads  As shown in Figure 12, when the FOSB is fully down on the kinematic coupling, the carriersensing pads must be z2 above horizontal datum plane. It is recommended that the areas surrounding all of thecarrier sensing pads be designed in conjunction with the features that mate with kinematic coupling pins so that amechanical sensor pin cannot interfere with the lead-in function of the kinematic couplings. Other sensing pads(called info pads and given letter names) communicate information about the carrier. Note that since this is a bottom

SEMI M31-0705 © SEMI 1998, 200521 APPENDIX 1APPLICATION NOTES NOTICE: This appendix is an official part of SEMI M31 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures onJuly 15, 1999. A1-1 Although FOSB parameters supporting effective reuse and cleaning (washing/drying) are not defined in thisdocument, it is essential that these capabilities be considered for a successful overall shipping box design. A1-2 It is important to note that shipping boxes containing wafers are typically bagged for shipment to the ICmanufacturer. It is therefore important to design the outer surfaces of the shipping box to be compatible with thiscommon practice. A1-3 Information about Automated-shippable DoorA1-3.1 When Automated-shippable door is used, the following contents should be understood for wafer quality.A1-3.2 Rear of Door (y51): Increasing the value of y51, might have impact to the capability for absorbing dropshock and wafer rotation during transportation, especially for x-direction since decreasing the area of holding waferby front wafer retainer. A1-4 Items which need to be considered for automated-shippable door closing and opening process:A1-4.1 When close or open the automated-shippable door by SEMI E62 compliant load port, not only SEMI E62defined f30 and f34, but also consideration of other factors which may not be defined by SEMI E62, such as speed,acceleration and deceleration of door closing and opening, are needed.A1-4.2 Excessive f34 may cause deformation of the box, as well as breakage of wafers which are contained in thebox. Door may be closed with lesser f34 by deploying designs which utilize door and box related forces, such aslatch key torque.A1-4.3 It needs to be considered that door may rebound at door opening process.A1-4.4 Retaining features force (f61): It is noted that strong clamping force may produce plastic deformation.

SEMI M32-0998 © SEMI 1998, 20041 SEMI M32-0998 (Reapproved 0704)GUIDE TO STATISTICAL SPECIFICATIONS This guide was technically reapproved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition reapproved by the North AmericanRegional Standards Committee on March 14, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org May 2004; to bepublished July 2004. Originally published September 1998. 1 Purpose1.1 Specifications are based on requirementsnegotiated between trading partners. This documentdescribes an explicit specification form that defines therisk level as a part of parametric specifications. Thisapproach uses process capability information to focusquality improvement efforts, reduce sampling, andmaintain low risks. It is based on the fundamental beliefthat specifications should facilitate the movementtoward processed-in quality instead of inspected-inquality.1.2 It is important for users and suppliers toacknowledge and mutually agree on quality levels sothe methods employed will satisfy their expectations.Statistical specifications provide a convenient way todo this.1.3 Statistical specifications are designed to facilitatethe movement toward processed-in quality. They aremost appropriate for processes that have beenstatistically characterized. This means the shape of thestatistical distribution that created the product is known,or can be approximated to the satisfaction of the userand the supplier. It also implies that the statisticalcontrol of the process and the measurement systems aredefined to the level that is necessary to meet the currentneeds. 2 Scope2.1 This guide may be used when changing or addingspecifications to SEMI M18.2.2 Statistical specifications apply to all processes thathave been statistically characterized. Solutions aregiven for two product distribution shapes (normal &lognormal), and the advantages of these solutions areexplained. Appendix 3 shows the statisticallycharacterized shape for many common silicon waferprocesses.2.3 This guide applies to processes related to theproduction and use of silicon wafers. It may also beapplied to the production and use of other materials.2.4 This approach implies that the quality level shippedis the same as the quality level produced.2.5 This methodology can be an effective tool fordriving quality improvement. 2.6 This procedure can be coupled with othertechniques for centering the mean and reducing thevariation within the process distribution as deemednecessary by the user and supplier.2.7 Appendix 4 further explains the rationale for thisapproach.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Outlier effects are beyond the scope of thisdocument. 4 Referenced Standard4.1 SEMI StandardSEMI M18  Format for Silicon Wafer SpecificationForm for Order EntryNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms5.1.1 Cpk  process capability index5.1.2 ppm  parts per million5.2 Definitions5.2.1 capability based sampling  any method thatuses the process capability as a factor in determiningthe required sampling.5.2.2 ECPK  process capability index on a non-normal process which is corrected for non-normality.5.2.3 error  the difference between the quality levelcommitted to a user and the level that could bereceived.5.2.4 process capability index (Cpk)  the smaller of(upper spec limit - mean)  3 sigma, or (mean - lowerspec limit)  3 sigma.

The firstportion of the normal statistical specification is thefamiliar tolerance. It uses an upper specification limit(USL) and a lower specification limit (LSL), or thetarget plus and/or minus a value. The second portion,after the @ sign below, is a measure of the qualitylevel, in ppm. LSL to USL @ yy ppm, orTarget ± xx @ yy ppm 6.1.2 Lognormal  The lognormal function describesmany of the one-sided distributions that areencountered in the silicon industry. It applies to thoseparameters such as flatness and warp that are boundedby zero.

SEMI M32-0998 © SEMI 1998, 20043 APPENDIX 1USING STATISTICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR NORMAL PROCESSES NOTICE: This appendix was approved as an official part of SEMI M32 by full letter ballot procedure. A1-1 Statistical Specification Format forNormal DistributionsA1-1.1 The normal distribution is quite well-known. Itdescribes processes that target a specific value and havesymmetric random variation about that value. Beloware examples of statistical specifications for normalprocesses. The first portion is the familiar tolerance,and the second portion is a measure of the quality level.LSL to USL @ yy ppm, orTarget ± xx @ yy ppm Other standard tolerance definitions could besubstituted, or other definitions of the quality level suchas Cpk, Z-value, or percent could be used.A1-1.2 Adding the quality level removes the potentialfor misunderstanding and makes the specification moremeaningful. A1-2 Example of UseA1-2.1 Functionally, statistical specifications aresimilar to conventional tolerances, except that thequality level is stated rather than just implied. They canbe directly substituted for tolerances or other forms ofspecifications. Statistical specifications are especiallyuseful for focusing quality improvement efforts,achieving ship-to-stock relationships, promotingprocessed in quality, and reducing after the factinspection. In this environment they could be used asfollows:A1-2.1.1 Through audits and capability reporting aparticular parameter is targeted for improvement orchosen as a ship-to-stock candidate.A1-2.1.2 The control methods, distribution shape, andstatistical specification are agreed upon. The toleranceand quality level defined in the statistical specificationcompletely define the needed process capability.A1-2.1.3 Once it is shown that the required capabilityis consistently exceeded then reduced inspectionsampling can be implemented without increasing therisk to the customer or supplier. In this way the processcontrols can gradually become the guarantee forquality, and after the fact inspection can be graduallyreduced to the level that is needed for outgoing qualityreporting. A1-3 DiscussionA1-3.1 Statistical specifications remove ambiguity,allow small risks, and promote the movement towardbetter process controls and less after the fact inspection.The quality level (i.e., the yy portion) is oftenmisunderstood. Some people say they want ppm levelquality but introduce methods that allow 50,000 to200,000 ppm in error. This causes confusion.A1-3.2 Many people have the misconception thattolerances are goal posts that require 100% of thematerial to fall inside. Processes are usually describedby statistical distributions, so specifications have littlemeaning if a quality level is not defined. For manyyears, 99.73% (i.e., ± 3 sigma) was considered to besatisfactory. Within tolerance was understood tomean within tolerance with a 99.73% confidence, or a0.27% quality level. Later the 99.73% process wasdefined as cruel. 0.27% was no longer an acceptablequality level, and process drift was understood to causeeven higher reject rates. This led to the demand forbetter process capabilities (i.e., higher Cpks), whichdemanded corresponding improvements in processcharacterization and control methodologies. At thesame time other users tightened their tolerances to thepoint that led to over-control. Either extreme can causea mismatch between expectations and capabilities if therisks are not carefully evaluated.A1-3.3 Capability-based sampling is perhaps the onlyway to rigorously transfer from inspection-basedquality to process control-based quality, withoutincurring high risks. Statistical specifications create theenvironment for this to work. Once the specification isclearly defined, it can be clearly achieved. The detailsof capability based sampling are beyond the scope ofthis document, but the basic concept is easy tounderstand. If a process is very capable and controlled,then the system can be relied upon to create thenecessary quality level with less after the factinspection. This is good for both sides. Users get morereliable quality, and suppliers get the informationneeded to focus quality improvement efforts and directresources at the most critical processes.

SEMI M32-0998 © SEMI 1998, 2004 4 A1-3.4 Once a process has been statisticallycharacterized, everything becomes much easier.Calculations can be done in milliseconds instead ofminutes. This includes spec acceptance, comparisons, and many forms of analysis. Multiple levels like % &lt; A,% &lt; B, and % &lt; C are also clearly unnecessary if thedistribution shape is known. This prevents a largeamount of duplicate work.

SEMI M32-0998 © SEMI 1998, 20045 APPENDIX 2USING STATISTICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR LOGNORMALPROCESSES NOTICE: This appendix was approved as an official part of SEMI M32 by full letter ballot procedure. A2-1 Statistical Specification Format forLognormal DistributionsA2-1.1 The lognormal probability distribution functiondescribes many of the one-sided distributionsencountered in the silicon industry. It applies to thoseone-sided parameters like flatness and warp that arebounded by zero. Below is an example of a statisticalspecification for a lognormal process. ≤ xx @ yy ppm A2-1.2 Other standard tolerance definitions could besubstituted, or other quality level definitions such asECPK, Z-value, or percent could be used. Again, ECPKis the Equivalent normal Cpk that corrects for non-normality. More information on the Equivalent Cpk isshown at the end of this appendix.A2-1.3 As with the normal distribution, adding thequality level removes the potential formisunderstanding and makes the specification moremeaningful. A2-2 Example of UseA2-2.1 Again, the major objectives are to focus qualityimprovement efforts, achieve ship-to-stockrelationships, promote processed in quality, and reduceafter the fact inspection. The steps are the same asshown in Section A1-2 for the normal distribution. Themajor difference is that only the upper tail needs to beconsidered. However, since the lognormal tail goes somuch farther out, it might be necessary to accept a lesscritical quality level. A2-3 DiscussionA2-3.1 Statistical specifications work very well forprocesses with lognormal distributions. They have allthe benefits described for normal distributions, and insome respects, they are even easier. Since lognormalprocesses only have one tail, checking each tail todecide which is the most critical is not necessary. Also,it has been empirically observed that lognormalprocesses are not as prone to mean drifting, so they tendto be more stable. The main hurdle is realizing howmuch error is introduced if the distribution shape isassumed to be normal when it is not. A2-3.1.1 Figure A2-1 illustrates the difference betweena lognormal and a normal process. The curve which hasa solid line (and is clearly not symmetrical) is thelognormal distribution. The curve with the dashed lineis the normal distribution. The error when mistakenlyusing a normal distribution to characterize a lognormalprocess is shown in Table A2-1. For values thatincrement by 1 sigma from the mean, the ppm greaterthan that value is given for each curve, and thedifference (or error) is calculated. To make it easier tovisualize, increments of the simple normal mean andsigma (1.8263 and 0.7568 respectively) are used in thevalue column. For calculating the lognormal statisticsthe correct lognormal geometric mean of 1.8258 andthe lognormal geometric sigma of 0.7550 are used. Theerror between the curves increases as the point ofinterest moves toward the center of the distribution, butthe most important issue is the length of the tail. Theright tail of the lognormal distribution extends alongwith the histogram, but the normal distribution is muchshorter. Visually, the significance might be overlookedin Figure A2-1, but when the tail probabilities areshown in ppm (Table A2-1) the difference is veryapparent. 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.9 3.9 4.8 5.8 6.7Figure A2-1Lognormal vs. Normal Curves

The difficulty in the past was thatmany of the calculations developed for the normaldistribution were not available for lognormal. Theequivalent normal Cpk (ECPK) was developed toaddress this issue. For the lognormal distribution,ECPK is calculated as shown below. It is an exactmathematical derivation with no estimations orassumptions. It was designed to allow people to see realdata and keep all transformations and conversionsinside the computer where they are totally invisible.Two cases are presented. Section A2-3.3 describes thecase where a statistical software is available, andSection A2-3.4 describes a shortcut that may be usedwhen the computation is derived from scratch. In bothcases, it is important to remember that only thecomputer will see these formulas.A2-3.3 Statistical software packages will usuallyoutput the geometric mean and geometric sigma. If  isthe lognormal geometric mean,  is the lognormal geo-metric sigma, and 1n is the natural log function, thenECPK is calculated as: ECPK =1n \[USL\] 1n22 + 2 3 1n2 + 22   For the example in Figure A2-1 the lognormalgeometric mean is 1.826 and the lognormal geometricsigma is 0.755. If an upper spec limit (USL) of 6 isapplied, then the ECPK is 1.06. This will usually be done in a computer. A programming version of thisformula is written as: ECPK = ((log (USL)) log (Gmean \*\*2 / (sqrt(Gmean \*\*2 + Gsigma\*\*2)))) / (3\* sqrt (log((Gmean \*\*2 + Gsigma\*\*2) / Gmean\* \*2))) A2-3.4 If the computation is programmed from scratchfor raw data, it may be convenient to take the naturallog of each data point (i.e., do a log transformation)then compute the mean of the transformed data(Tmean) and sigma of the transformed data (Tsigma).Again, ln is the natural log function. In this case, theECPK formula can be written as:ECPK = (1n(USL)  Tmean)/(3\* Tsigma)The geometric mean and geometric sigma could then becalculated as follows: Gmean = exp(Tmean + (Tsigma \* \*2)/2) Gsigma = sqrt((exp((2 \* Tmean) + (Tsigma \* \*2)))\*(exp((Tsigma \* \*2))  1)) A2-4 ConclusionLognormal calculations can be as easy as normalcalculations. Again, the formulas reside only in thecomputer where they are never seen by the user. Theyallow the user to view the actual measures and theactual distributions.

SEMI M32-0998 © SEMI 1998, 2004 8 APPENDIX 4RATIONALE FOR STATISTICAL SPECIFICATIONS NOTICE: This appendix was approved as an official part of SEMI M32 by full letter ballot procedure. A4-1 IntroductionA4-1.1 The purpose of a specification is either todefine acceptance criteria or to assist in qualityimprovement planning. The basic intent is to quantifyuser need so suppliers can accommodate that need.Developing a clear link between user needs and thecontrol methods used on the production floor is one ofthe most critical steps for creating a Total QualityManagement (TQM) environment. Following are somekey background concepts that allow the reader tounderstand the conclusions drawn in this document.A4-1.2 For most manufacturing processes there is nosuch thing as zero defects. Processes are described bystatistical probability distributions, and the tails of thesefunctions can go all the way to infinity. For many years,99.73% (i.e., ± 3 sigma) was used as the basis fortolerances. Within tolerance was understood to meanwithin tolerance with a 99.73% confidence, or a 0.27%quality level. When users requested better levels, thennew standards such as 33 ppm or 3.4 ppm were made.In any case, this quality level needs to be agreed uponfor a specification method to have meaning. It can bemeasured in terms of ppm, Z, Cpk (which is equal to Zdivided by 3), or percent. Z tables or Cpk tables can beobtained which provide this information.A4-1.3 Errors in the 10% or higher range can begenerated if a percentile specification is based on thecentral portion of the distribution. An example of such aspecification is 50% ≤ 1.2 microns. These errors arenot obvious and require careful statistical analysisbased upon real process variation. Multiple percentilespecifications are also difficult to apply. Paragraph A4-3 provides more details on these issues.A4-1.4 Conversely, if specifications get too far out onthe tail, they tend to become abstract and are not usedas the primary factor driving quality improvements.This is especially true for non-normal processes wherethe tail of the distribution goes out much farther thanexpected from a normal distribution. Figure A4-1shows where a 3.4 ppm specification would be on alognormal process. Users usually will not allow thatmuch tolerance. However, if the specification istightened while the process capability remains thesame, then the consequence is a degradation in thequality level. 01000 2000 3000 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.9 3.9 4.8 5.8 6.7 7.7 8.6 9.6 10 5Figure A4-1Lognormal Tolerance for 3.4 ppm Quality LevelA4-1.5 The mean and sigma specification is anotherproposed approach. Intuitively, this seems promising,but it has many of the same problems as multiplepercentile specifications. More details are given inParagraph A4-4.A4-1.6 Errors in the 5% to 10% range can also begenerated if process distributions are assumed to benormal when they are not. Knowing the actualdistribution shape is a key factor that opens up atremendous amount of knowledge. Figure A4-2 showsan example of real data that illustrates a lognormalprocess. In the past, this was considered to be difficultbecause non-normal distributions were only supportedby high-level statistical software. Now evenspreadsheets have them. It should also be noted thatonce the process characterization has been done, theshape of the distribution typically does not change, sothis knowledge can be shared throughout the industry.Regularly monitoring the process by overlaying thedistribution on the process histogram or cumulativefrequency plot is extremely valuable to confirm that theprocess is not taking on unnatural bimodal or outliereffects. One-sided distributions such as flatness andwarp are so well-characterized by the lognormaldistribution that goodness-of-fit results are very closeto 100%. Again, the error gets larger as the point-ofinterest moves toward the center of the distribution,but the major concern is the length of the tail. Thelognormal distribution in Figure A4-2 (the curve with asolid line which is clearly not symmetrical) has a tailthat extends much farther to the right than the normaldistribution which is shown with a dashed line. Thiseffect, and the impact, is shown in more detail inAppendix 2.

This allows both the user and supplier tooptimize their control systems to that level. Capabilitybased sampling is one example. Simply put, this meansto use process capability information to help define thesampling plan for a process. A detailed discussion ofthis subject is beyond the scope of this document, butthe basic concept is easy to understand. If a process isvery capable and controlled it does not need as muchsampling as one that is not. Implementing this strategyis a big step ahead of standard sampling theory. It mightbe the only way to rigorously transfer from inspectionbased quality to process control based quality, withoutincurring high risks. Statistical specifications create theenvironment which facilitates this improved strategy.Hopefully, the quality levels would be defined in ppm,but any level agreed upon by both the user and thesupplier would work. A4-2 Tolerance Specifications LSL to USL, or Target ± xx A4-2.1 The main problem with a conventionaltolerance is that many people perceive it as a goal postthat requires 100% of the material to fall inside. Thisdocument has shown in detail that this is simply awrong perception. Stating the quality level in thespecification, instead of just implying it, corrects thisproblem.A4-2.2 Another common misconception is thattolerances and tail probabilities divert attention awayfrom centering the process. Of course, centering isimportant. Considering the impact of poor quality on allcustomers, it is clear that a well centered process is farmore efficient than one that is not. It is also generallytrue that the suitability of the product is notsignificantly different immediately on one side of atolerance line compared to the other. However, thereare a number of issues that warrant discussion. A4-2.2.1 First, centering is usually not difficult, so itusually does not need a major emphasis. Those who areexperienced in quality improvement techniques wouldcertainly not forget to center the process. Simplymonitoring the mean trend gives an excellent measureof centering, and it keeps the focus on the processrather than the specification. Industry carries a longhistory where specifications prevented the attainment ofgood process control. Many of the issues have beenexplained earlier in this document. To summarize,process controls are the only way to truly maintain acentered process, and these controls can only work ifthere is enough tolerance in the specification toaccommodate the sensitivity limitations of the controlmethods.A4-2.2.2 The second issue is that it might not bepossible to center. This is clearly the case in one-sidedprocesses that are bounded by zero. Optimizingmultiple parameters might also dictate that someparameters get worse.A4-2.2.3 The final, and most important, issue is thechallenge of teaching statistical methods to the factorypopulation. It is very easy to teach averages andcentering since they tend to be well understood already.It is not as easy to teach sigma and the fact that sigmatrends must be thoroughly understood before much ofanything can be said about averages. Confirming thatthe R or S chart is controlled before studying the Xbarchart and doing an F-test before doing a t-test are justtwo examples. These are very important concepts thatmust be fully understood in order to apply statisticalmethods. Over-stressing centering de-emphasizes sigmaand creates an environment where it is not appreciated.Thinking in terms of sigma is the most importantconcept that most people will learn about processcontrol methods. It deserves a major emphasis.A4-2.2.4 Of course, centering would be a concern ifmixing and matching of lots is the control method, butthis can be easily spotted in the statisticalcharacterization process. The fact that some of thealternatives to tolerances are much more likely to causethis practice will be further explained in Paragraphs A4-3 and A4-4. A4-3 Multiple Distributional PercentileSpecifications % ≤ A, % ≤ B, and % ≤ C A4-3.1 Errors in the 10% or higher range can begenerated if a specification in the central portion of thedistribution is used. An example of such a specificationis 50% ≤ 1.2 microns.

SEMI M32-0998 © SEMI 1998, 2004 10 A4-3.2 No control method can hold a process perfectlystill. Even the best real-time control methods can allowa process to drift as much as ± 1.5 sigma. For thisreason, a 6-sigma design was defined as 4.5 sigma tothe nearest tolerance.A4-3.3 Sampling issues are a major concern. Manykinds of variation can be quantified by rigorouslystudying the appropriate samplings (within batchsamples for batch-to-batch variation, monthly samplesfor month-to-month variation, etc.). However, there arepractical limits on how many kinds of variation can becontinuously monitored. There is a large amount ofwork involved, and there are hundreds of potentialsources of variation. Resource restrictions regularlyforce suppliers to concentrate on the known keyvariables and leave the rest as error in the system (atleast for now). As sample periods get longer, there ismore statistical sensitivity, but also more probabilitythat the drift will be confounded with user-drivenprocess improvements. For example, month-to-monthrandom drift is hard to quantify because productionprocesses are often improved before many months ofdata can be observed. Measurement error is anothermain contributor which further complicates the othersensitivity issues. These factors all combine to allow acertain amount of undetectable process drift. Thisprocess drift needs to be considered when defining thespecification approach.A4-3.4 These variations cannot be detected because ofstatistical sensitivity limitations. Table A4-1 shows thesample sizes needed to detect different levels of processshift. Delta will be defined as the number of sigma ofundetectable mean drift. For simplicity, a one-way shiftis shown, but in most practical cases, the shift could goplus or minus. Using the old standard of 5% supplierrisk and 10% user risk, 72 samples are needed to detecta delta of 0.25 sigma. This example (0.25 sigma ofmean drift) has been used throughout this document.Since most of the discussion will relate to process drift,the terms drift and shift will be usedinterchangeably. Clearly, 72 is too large a sampling formost real-time control systems, but it is still anunderstatement of the problem. Most users currentlyexpect their risk to be much smaller than 10%. The lastrow shows that the sample size would need to be 311 toreach 0.1% user and supplier risks. It is generallyagreed that 0.1% (i.e., 1000 ppm) is the lowest levelthat is feasible using standard probability theory. Forlower levels, it is necessary to move farther out on thedistribution tails where it is necessary to rely on morethan just stndard sampling probabilities. Table A4-1 Sampling Requirements(a = supplier risk, b = user risk)DetectableMean Shift(in Sigma) 0.125 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.0 Min Na = 20%b = 20% 92 24 7 4 4 Min Na = 5%b = 10% 280 72 20 10 7 Min Na = 1%b = 1% 696 177 47 23 15 Min Na = 0.1%b = 0.1% 1228 311 82 40 25 A4-3.5 Figures A4-3, A4-4, and A4-5 show the errorgenerated by 0.25 sigma of undetectable mean drift.Again, the number of sigma of undetectable mean driftwill be defined as delta. Notice how the error grows asthe point of interest moves toward the center of thedistribution. At the four sigma point (out on the tail)there is very little error, so suppliers can be generouswith internal buffer specifications to protect the user.This is not as feasible in the center of the distributionbecause there is so much material at stake. A percentilespecification in the center of the process shown wouldhave about 1000 times more undetected, out-of-specproduct than a specification at the 4 sigma point. Sincethe shift could go either way, this could also be 1000times more material that was rejected and should nothave been. 0 50 100 8 10 13 15 18 20 23 26 28Figure A4-3Error at 0 SigmaA4-3.6 The left curve in Figure A4-3 shows adistribution with an expected mean of 18. The rightcurve shows the same distribution with an undetectabledrift of 0.25 sigma. If a specification limit is placed at18, then 50% of the material is below the specificationfor the nominal distribution. However, only 40.13% isbelow the specification for the distribution that hasdrifted. The error, shown by the area between thevertical lines and below the right curve, is 9.87% or98,700 ppm.

The delta and the resulting error can get muchlarger.A4-3.11 A major concern is what to do when thespecification is not met. Users would certainly not wantsuppliers to reject material in the center of thedistribution. Alternatives are to (1) reject the wholeshipment, (2) reject nearby lots, (3) mix and match lots,or (4) translate the percentage hypothetically lost in thecenter back out to the tail in order to reject the worstmaterial. The first two alternatives are really more likepenalties and would lead to unnecessary loss of goodmaterial. The third is the worst form of inspecting inquality. It is generally agreed that this is the main thingto avoid. Translating the error back to the tail ispossible but not necessarily a good approach. Thiswould involve translating a reject percentage with alarge potential error back out to a region that wouldhave had a very small error. A multiple percentilespecification can also be quite difficult in a productionenvironment. Each of the percentile criteria must beevaluated to determine which one requires the highestreject rate. That reject rate must then be translated backto the tail, and 100% sample data must be used todetermine which actual pieces to reject. If the statisticaldistribution is defined, one specification would give thesame amount of information with much less work. Ifonly one criterion is used, and it is well out on the tail(hopefully in the ppm range) then this method is verysimilar to a statistical specification.A4-3.12 A commonly stated goal of multiple percentilespecifications is to focus on centering rather thandistribution tails. All of the discussion in Section A4-2.2 concerning centering is equally applicable here.Multiple percentile specifications are more likely tocause inspected-in quality which detracts from processcontrol based centering.A4-3.13 Ease of use is another stated goal, but for allof the reasons stated above, this method is one of themost difficult to use. Statistical calculations can bedone in milliseconds while the potential of largesamplings, raw data manipulation, and duplicate effortassociated with multiple distributional percentilespecifications create much more work. Characterizingwith percentiles is an alternative for processes that havenot yet been statistically characterized, but once thathurdle is crossed, everything gets many times easier.

SEMI M32-0998 © SEMI 1998, 2004 12 A4-4.1 First, please note that the term sigma isintentionally used, rather than standard deviation.This does not in any way imply 100% sampling.Instead, the implication is that the process would needto be monitored long enough to understand the processsigma (i.e., the state at which the process can becontrolled).A4-4.2 Mean and sigma specifications intuitively seemvery promising, but they have many of the sameproblems as multiple distributional percentilespecifications. Here, the issue of statistical sensitivity isparticularly important. Table A4-1, and the discussionin Section A4-3.4 concerning sampling requirements,explain the central issue. The sample sizes required todetect smaller mean shifts are very large, so theyusually are not feasible at the process control point. Asa result, mean and sigma specifications could lead tomuch more sampling in an inspection area or in thewarehouse, where larger quantities are available. Tokeep the sample sizes small, it is necessary to allow aspecified amount of process drift. Therefore, some formof tolerance is necessary.A4-4.3 Another factor that needs careful considerationis the movement toward controlling surrogate variablesinstead of outgoing parameters. Many types of variationcan be controlled by carefully applying the appropriatesamplings (within batch samples for batch-to-batchvariation, within lot samples for lot-to-lot variation,etc.). However, there are practical limitations on howmany types of variation can be continuously monitored.There is a large amount of work involved, and there arehundreds of potential sources of variation. Resourcerestrictions regularly force suppliers to concentrate onthe known key variables and leave the rest as error inthe system (at least for now). This practice, calledhomogeneous sampling, is designed to continuouslyhome in on the variables that have the greatest impacton the distribution. Strictly speaking, for characterizingprocess capability, a random and over-time samplingwhich covers all sources of variation should be used. Inpractice, this is difficult to do, so engineering judgmentis needed to select the most appropriate homogeneoussampling. This is yet another issue that could generatesignificant errors if it is not fully understood.A4-4.4 From an ease-of-use standpoint, mean andsigma specifications have many of the same issues asmultiple distributional percentile specifications. Mixingand matching of lots would be especially tempting withthis approach because it might be the only practicalalternative.

SEMI M33-0998 © SEMI 19981 SEMI M33-0998TEST METHOD FOR THE DETERMINATION OF RESIDUAL SURFACECONTAMINATION ON SILICON WAFERS BY MEANS OF TOTALREFLECTION X-RAY FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY (TXRF) 1 Purpose1.1 The test provides the analytica l procedure todetermine the trace level of contaminating elements ofan atomic number higher than 15 on polished orepitaxial silicon wafer surfaces in native or thermallygrown or tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) oxide or inresidues of microdroplets of process chemicals ormedia as analyzed with TXRF on silicon wafer surfacesas described in Sections 15.1 and 15.2. 2 Scope2.1 This document specifies a VPD -TXRF (VaporPhase Decomposition Total Reflection X-RayFluorescence Spectroscopy) method to analyze theelemental composition and areal density of impurities,that include cations and anions with atomic numbersbetween 16 (S) and 92 (U) independent of theirchemical state, with the exception of the X-ray sourcematerial, on polished or epitaxial silicon wafer surfacesin native or thermally grown oxide or in residues ofmicrodroplets of process chemicals or media asanalyzed with TXRF on silicon wafer surfaces.2.2 This test is especially useful fo r analyzing metallicelements such as K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu,Zn, (Mo), Pd, Ag, Sn, Sb, Ta, (W), Pt, (Au), Hg, and Pband non-metallic elements such as S, Cl, As, Br, and Ithrough their characteristic K and L lines. (Elements inbrackets are usual X-ray sources.) For limitations in thenature of analytes refer to the note in Section 14.7.2.3 This test method can be used t o analyze arealsurface contamination that can be collected in amicrodroplet during the specified VPD preparation andthe collection of the digested surface contamination inthe range of 5  10 8 through 5  10 12 atoms/cm2.2.4 Theoretically, the detection lim it (LOD) of eachanalyte depends upon its atomic number. As defined byDIN 32645 Limit of detection, determination andquantification the LOD of TXRF is also dependingupon many parameters, such as: excitation energy, intensity of incident X-ray, instrumental background, crystallographic interferences, such as Braggdiffraction conditions,  impurities in the beam path, contamination of the blank scanning solution(see Section 4.5), contamination level in the analytical ambient, surface microroughness of wafer at themicrodroplet (see Section 6.7), and integration time. 2.5 Concerning the surface conditi ons to be analyzed,the VPD-TXRF method is invasive. Nevertheless, theTXRF analysis of the microdroplet residue can berepeated many times provided that the preparedspecimen is stored in a clean environment. Thesubstrate and/or surrogate wafers can be recycled formonitoring purposes.2.6 The user of this test method m ust assure that themetrology equipment is under control by the procedurescommonly utilized in the performing laboratory. In theabsence of established control procedures the use of4.11.2 EN-ISO 9001 is recommended.NOTICE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS  This standarddoes not purport to address the safety concerns,associated with its use.

That microdroplet isdried on the wafer under controlled conditions andanalyzed with TXRF.5.2 Similarly, a microdroplet of pr ocess chemicals ormedia can be dried on hydrophobic polished orepitaxial silicon wafer under controlled conditions andanalyzed with TXRF.5.3 Preferably, monochromatic an d collimated X-raysirradiate a planarized and chemi-mechanically polished,monocrystalline silicon wafer surface. The X-raysimpinge the surface at a glancing angle that is below theangle for total reflection of the X-rays, preferably, at anincident angle 70% of the angle of total reflection \[1.3mrad (or 0.07 degrees) for Mo target and 2.0 mrad (or0.11 degrees) for W target\].5.4 The evanescent waves excite t he fluorescenceenergy levels of the surface atoms, which then emitfluorescence X-rays characteristic of their atomicnumber. The emitted X-rays are detected by a solidstate detector that is an energy dispersive spectrometer.In the range of specified areal density (compare withSection 2.3 of this document) the integrated count rate(cps) is linearly proportional to the elemental arealdensity.5.5 For quantification, the linear re gression must beestablished (c.f., Section 15.6) or a linearproportionality is anticipated between the cps data thatare measured above the certified referencemicrodroplet(s) and the cps data that are measuredabove the microdroplet of the unknown analyteswithout changing the anglescan conditions, accordingto Sections 9.1, 13.6, and 15.7. 6 Interferences6.1 The known interferences in X-r ay fluorescencespectroscopy also affect TXRF. Thus, overlappingfluorescence lines, escape peak, energy gain drift, X-raysource stability, beam path background contaminationmust be evaluated according to Section 15.7 of thisdocument.6.2 Baseline corrections due to va rying backgroundcontamination must be controlled by the rules of statistical analysis (e.g., as described in Section 15.8 ofthis document).6.3 Under the specified conditions , no corrections arerequired for secondary fluorescence or for oscillationsor for matrix absorption as described in Sections 15.915.11 of this document.6.4 Accuracy of the standard refer ence specimen andpositioning accuracy and precision of the detectordefine the bias in the assigned areal density.6.5 Mechanical vibration may deg rade the detectorresolution and it can also decrease the selectivity.6.6 Multielement contamination d egrades the LODcompared with monoelement contamination.6.7 Increased surface microroughn ess and/or high-total signal count rates result in high deadtime and canlead to non-linearity of detected fluorescence signalversus areal density (i.e., to degradation of LOD).6.8 Under optical conditions satisf ying the Braggreflections the background noise depends upon theazimuthal orientation of the sample. Beforequantification, a determination of the azimuthal angularrange, that shows minimum Bragg reflectionbackground, is recommended. Otherwise the LOD maydegrade due to high background and spurious peaks.6.9 During handling and measurem ent particles orvolatile contamination (e.g., NH3) from the analyticalenvironment must be controlled and avoided.6.10 During measurement Ar must be excluded fromthe analytical ambient (e.g., by evacuating the chamberor flushing it with He).6.11 Curve smoothing and evaluatio n algorithms withcontrolled Fourier parameters or Digital Filtering arepreferred to direct count rate evaluation because thesealgorithms provide a higher level of statisticalconfidence than a software that directly quantifies cpsas described in Section 15.12 of this document.6.12 Recovery rates as defined in S ection 4.13 of thisdocument depend upon the distribution of the analytesbetween the scanning solution (solubility) and siliconsurface (adsorption and plating). Therefore, recoveryrates depend on the: applied scanning solution (Sections 4.5, 8.3), chemical nature of the differentanalytes/elements, and physical and physicochemical state of the siliconsurface. 6.13 Automated contamination coll ection procedure(scanning) increases the wafer-to-wafer reproducibility

Thesystem is preferably equipped with a flat/notch-finder and quick-search option. For details, seeSection 6.10 of this document and Section 7.1 ofASTM F 1526. 7.3 The VPD and the advisable dr ying chamber(s) willhave opening(s) made of polyvinylidenfluoride(PVDF), polyfluoroalkoxyethylene (PFA), polyfluoro-ethylene (PTFE) or similar resistant and pure polymermaterials that will not be attacked by HF. Thechamber(s) may contain one or more wafers on stacks.The use of a drying chamber is advisable for thepreparation of the calibration reference microdroplet(c.f., Section 10.1), but optional for the analysisprocedure. When a drying chamber is used, it must beevacuable to below 1 kPa. After evacuation thechamber is to be flushed with filtered N2 until thecomplete drying of the microdroplet residue is achieved(see Section 9.1 of this document).7.4 For the aliquots of standard sto ck and scanningsolutions validated micropipettes must be used.Validation procedure can follow the requirements ofDIN 12650 Part 6. 8 Reagents and MaterialsSAFETY PRECAUTIONS  Handling HNO 3, HF andH 2O 2 is dangerous. Operators must comply with X-raysafety regulations and be trained to wear protectivegarments and glasses when handling HNO3, HF andH 2O 2 under efficient exhaust. 8.1 Ultra Pure Water, HNO3, HF, H 2 O  Asspecified in ASTM D 5127, SEMI C7.3, C7.5, andC7.6, respectively.8.2 Standard Stock Solution  Ce rtified and traceablestandard reference stock solution with knownamount(s) of nitrate salt of the metals and sodium saltof the non-metallic elements to be analyzed. Dilutionshave to be acidified with HNO 3 at pH ≤ 2. Note that theshelf life of diluted solutions in the ppb-range of g/Lor ng/L is less than 2 days.8.3 Tested Scanning Droplet (Sect ions 4.5 and 6.12) 50 to 100 L of ultra pure water or other scanningsolutions (e.g., aqueous HF (1 volume %) and H 2 O 2 (30volume %)). The composition of the scanning dropletmust provide a controlled recovery rate above 90% foreach analyte, including Cu.8.4 Blank Scanning Solution  Th e composition andthe amount of a scanning droplet without surfaceimpurities.8.5 Microdroplet Residue  Micr odroplet calibrationstandard reference solution and/or scanning ormicrodroplet of a liquid process medium dried at roomtemperature under controlled conditions according toSection 7.3. Above the microdroplet residue thefluorescence count rate remains independent ofazimuthal position and of varying incident angle forangles below 80% of the critical angle as described inSection 15.6 of this document.8.6 Surrogate Wafers  Polished or epitaxial wafersused as carrier plates for scanning droplets collectedfrom other specimen wafers. 9 Preparation of Certified R eferenceMicrodroplet for Calibration Standard9.1 Tested Preparation Conditions  Depositmicrodroplets containing 0.01 ng, 0.1 ng and 1 ng Ni inNi (NO 3) 2 in 100 L of a diluted standard stocksolution onto (a) hydrophobic (see Section 4.12 of thisdocument) polished or epitaxial wafer(s). Dry it (them)under controlled conditions (e.g., in a drying chamberat room temperature). When a drying chamber is used,flush the chamber with a slow flow of N2 for 20minutes, then evacuate it (see Section 7.3 of thisdocument). The droplets must not explode or extendduring drying. They should not exceed an arealdimension of 1 mm in any direction. Elements forming

It is the responsibility of the user of thisstandard to establish and maintain appropriate safetyand health practices and comply with the localregulatory ordinance. The X-ray source must beinactivated when beam path is unshielded. Operatorsmust be trained to avoid exposure to X-ray irradiation. 10.1 The calibration standard is a microdroplet of 100L of a diluted certified standard reference stocksolution. Note that the shelf life of diluted solutions inthe sub-ppb-range of g/L or ng/mL is less than 2 days.10.2 Locate the calibration standard microdropletresidue and place it under the detector. Adjust theglancing angle into the range where the fluorescencecount rate is independent of varying incidence angle(see Section 8.5 of this document).10.3 Position the detector window a s follows. Setmapping or quick search parameters for covering theresidue(s) with 3  3 detection spots (see Figure 1),which are placed around the residue(s) as described inSection 15.6 of this document. The mapped surfacemust cover at least 95% of the square around theresidue(s) that is lying about in the center of thedetection spot. The analyzed part of microdropletresidue under the detection spot must be higher than95%. Figure 1VPD-Search VPD/TXRF10.4 Set for mapping around the mi crodroplet residuewith a 50-sec integration time program at eachdetection spot. Integrate at the maximum position(s) forat least 1000 sec. These data provide the final result ofcalibration due to the algorithm given in Section 13.6 ofthis document. 10.5 Repeat calibration cycle (load-a nalyze-unload) atleast 3-times.10.6 In order to distinguish relevan t results fromparticle contamination from the environment and frominefficient contamination collection, repeatmeasurement on blank surface adjacent to themicrodroplet solution. The data are to be considered asbackground data in the quantification algorithm (seeSection 15.12 of this document). For valid calibration,background fluorescence counts must remain less than20% of the fluorescence counts of microdropletresidues, particularly, at lower areal densities (&lt; 1  10 9atoms/cm2).10.7 The integrated fluorescence co unts measuredwith the specified Ni calibration standard can beconverted by known sensitivity factors into otherelements of interest as described in the Referencessection (see Sections 15.14 and 15.15 of thisdocument).10.8 Keep the calibration standards in closed,identifiable wafer holders in a clean room at roomtemperature under conditions that will not change thefluorescence reproducibility.10.9 Optional linearity tests should deploy themethods described in References section (see Section15.16 of this document). Similar statistical linearitytests can also be applied.10.10 Upon the users request, the ab soluteinstrumental calibration factor can be obtained. Due tothe Fresnel theory of X-ray absorption andenhancement on pure metal (Ni) surfaces, the absolutecalibration can be carried out under specific opticalconditions. (See Referenced Documents section andspecifically Section 15.17.). Then, that absolutecalibration can be correlated to the externalmicrodroplet calibration. 11 Preparation Procedure11.1 VPD treatment of the wafer su rface (Section4.16) and the collection of contamination collectionwith a scanning microdroplet (Section 4.5).SAFETY PRECAUTIONS  Handling HF isdangerous. It is the responsibility of the user of thisstandard to establish and maintain appropriate safetyand health practices and comply with the localregulatory ordinance. Operators must be trained to wearprotective garments and glasses when handling HFunder efficient exhaust. 11.2 In the VPD chamber wafers ar e treated with HFvapor (e.g., isothermally distilled at room temperaturefrom an aqueous solution (2050 volume %) within theVPD chamber). The analytical specimen, the calibration

&lt;!-- Page 29 --&gt;

SEMI M33-0998 © SEMI 1998 6 droplet and the scanning droplet must be handled,prepared and dried under specified and controlledconditions. Drying means the evaporation of thesolvents on the wafer surface in a clean and controlledenvironment without loosing analytes from themicrodroplet residue.11.3 The wafers are exposed to the HF vapor in theVPD chamber at room temperature. The exposure timedepends on the concentration of the HF used and on thepreceeding wafer treatment. The time has to be longenough to ensure that the wafer surface will becomehydrophobic. After the HF treatment the solubilizedreaction products are collected by scanning amicrodroplet over the whole surface. Automaticscanning is preferable (see Section 6.13 of thisdocument). The composition of the scanning solution isoptional but its volume and drying conditions should bethe same as under the preparation of calibrationstandards (see Sections 8 and 15.18 of this document).11.4 An example for tested prepara tion conditionsaccording to Section 15.18 of this document. A PTFEor PFA petri dish of a diameter &gt; 25 cm is filled with20 volume % HF by mixing DI ultra pure water and 40volume % HF of ULSI grade in a clean room ambientof Cl 10 by U.S. Federal Standard 209. The petri dish ispositioned in the bottom of the VPD chamber, loadedwith specimen wafers. The wafers are exposed to theHF wafer at room temperature. Exposure time isbetween 30 minutes and 6 hours. Longer exposuretimes can lead to deliberate etching. After the HFtreatment the solubilized, reaction products arecollected by rolling a scanning microdroplet over thewhole surface. Automatic scanning is preferable. Pleaserefer also to Section 4.5 and Section 8.3 of SEMI E45.11.5 Rinse the validated micropipet te at least 5 timeswith ultra pure water or with the selected scanningsolution. Then fill the micropipette with the requiredamount of ultra pure water or with the scanningsolution. For scanning surfaces with thicker siliconoxide (&gt; 300 nm) only about 50 L of scanningsolution is sufficient. The microdroplet to be dried foranalysis should not extensively (+10%) exceed 100 Ltogether with the VPD reaction products.11.6 Put the scanning microdroplet on the wafersurface and roll the scanning microdroplet around thewafer edge 2 times and then over the whole surface in azigzag pattern. Automatic equipment can scan in aspiral pattern with overlapping paths (see Section 6.13).An edge exclusion of less than 1 mm is attainable formanual or automatic scanning. Edge exclusion is wellbelow 1 mm at automatic scanning.11.7 Position the scanning microdro plet in the centerof the wafer. 11.8 For monitoring the cleanliness of the VPDpreparation and contamination collection and that of theanalytical ambient, put the same volume of the blankscanning solution, as applied to the preparation of thecalibration standard (100 L under tested preparationconditions), with the validated micropipette onto thescanned specimen surface at least 3 cm off the positionof the scanning solution. For valid results fluorescencecounts above the blank must remain less than 20% ofthe fluorescence counts above the droplet residues. Useultra pure water (100 L) for blanks of processchemical and media samples. If the scanning solutionconsists only of ultra pure water of controlled quality,no blanks are required.NOTE: In the absence of oxidation agent(s), Cu recoveryrates can be reduced (see Section 15.18). 11.9 Dry the wafers as specified in Sections 7.3, 9.1,and 11.2 of this document. 12 Analysis Procedure12.1 Localize the microdroplet resid ues of thecollected scanning solution or the microdroplet residuesof the liquid process medium and the microdropletresidue of the blank scanning solution. Detectfluorescence counting rates above these microdropletresidues and above the scanned blank surface under theinstrumental parameter adjusted for calibration. Thequantification algorithm is given in Section 13.6.Integrated counts above both the blanks and the VPDprepared surface must not exceed 20% of the integratedcounts above the microdroplet residue of the collectedscanning solution (see Section 9.6 of this document). 13 Quantification Procedure13.1 The instrument must run unde r establishedstatistical process control (e.g., as described in Section15.19 of this document).13.2 Before releasing results, quote instrumentalparameters such as: rotating or sealed anode, voltage and current applied to the X-ray source, characteristic excitation line(s) of the incident X-ray, glancing angle(s), type of monochromator, amount \[ng\] or \[number of atoms\] of e.g., Ni in thecalibration standard reference microdroplet, location of the microdroplet(s) analyzed, peak evaluation technique (ROI or peak-fitting),

Test Methods - Dimensions7.1 SIMOX Layer Thickness Measurements7.1.1 Measurements Methods  Two non-contact,non-destructive optical characterization techniques,spectroscopic reflectometry and spectroscopicellipsometry, have proven useful for SIMOX layerthickness measurements. Both techniques use reflectedlight to allow deduction of the thickness and refractiveindex of thin film layers. In both cases, film thicknessand index of refraction data must be "backed out" of themeasured optical data by a process of successiveapproximation. In both cases, the fitting procedure ismore straightforward and more accurate the as-annealedSIMOX wafers with abrupt silicon/oxide interfaces thanfor the implanted SIMOX wafers with extended interface zones. Silicon islands and interfacenonuniformities make these techniques problematic forSIMOX wafers with oxygen implant doses below the"stoichiometric dose", roughly 1.6 10 18 O+/cm2 for a375 nm oxide layer.7.1.1.1 The measurement strategy is to make a detailedmeasurement with an accurate fit on at least five wafersites, including the center as illustrated in Figure 1. Thenumber of wafer sites to be monitored should be agreedon between customer and vendor. Generally, the greaterthe variability relative to the mean, the larger thenumber of sites that should be monitored. In each case,the measurement system supplies a "goodness-of-fit"parameter which indicates a level of confidence in thefit to the measured data.

SEMI M34-0299 © SEMI 19993 7.1.2 Spectroscopic Ellipsometry Measurement  Inthis measurement, white light from a xenon arc lamppasses through a polarizing rotating filter andilluminates the sample site under study; reflected lightpasses through an analyzer to a monochromator andphotomultiplier detector. For each wavelength,reflectivity oscillates with polarizer rotation; themagnitude and phase of reflectivity changes aremeasured to determine ellipsometric angles,  and .The two measured spectra are fit by successiveapproximation to allow determination of the silicon andoxide layer thickness and oxide composition.Ellipsometry measurements are only specified for theannealed SIMOX wafers. For spectroscopicellipsometry, the choice of instrument and associatedmodel and fitting parameters affect the confidence-of-fit, so they should be taken into account in theuser/supplier agreement. For example, with the SOPRASE system, the goodness-of-fit error estimator shall beless than 0.025 for accurate structural models.7.1.3 Optical Reflectance Measurements  In thismeasurement, light from a xenon arc lamp passesthrough a grating monochromator and illuminates thesample site under study; reflected light is gathered byan intrinsic silicon detector. Specular reflectivity isplotted as a function of wavelength from 0.4 micron to1.1 micron. The analysis proceeds by makingsuccessively better approximations to the oxygencontent, index of refraction, and absorption of eachlayer until an acceptable fit is achieved. Measurementsare made with a reflectance mode opticalinterferometer.7.1.4 Optical Model Fitting and Correlation  Thereare slight, systematic differences between layerthickness measured by reflectance and by spectroscopicellipsometry (SE). Because of this, user and suppliershould specify the actual measurement method to beused. The two methods offer results which arereproducible and well-correlated with each other over awide range of conditions. If both measurementtechniques are used, it is recommended that thereflectance system measurements be calibrated to fit theresults of the SE. Figure 2 shows conversion curves fortop silicon and oxide layer thickness measurementsmade with the two measurement techniques.7.1.5 Top Silicon Layer Thickness  See Section7.1.4 on correlation of reflectance and spectroscopicellipsometry (SE) measurements. Optical measure-ments will be made on five wafer sites as shown inFigure 1. Spectra for each site will be fit independentlywith both the top silicon and oxide layer thickness asadjustable parameters. Both the mean thickness and theuniformity should be specified. Depending on the typeof SIMOX wafer being specified, the mean thickness of the top silicon layer will be from 50 nm to 500 nm.Following is an example specification: Mean top siliconlayer thickness for the five sites will be 215 ± 10 nmwith acceptable goodness-of-fit at all five sites. Topsilicon non-uniformity will be less than ± 5 nm.7.1.6 Buried Oxide Layer Thickness  See Section7.1.4 on correlation of reflectance and spectroscopicellipsometry (SE) measurements. Optical measure-ments will be made on five wafer sites as shown inFigure 1. Spectra for each site will be fit independentlywith both the top silicon and the buried oxide layerthickness as adjustable parameters. Both the meanthickness and the uniformity should be specified.Depending on the type of SIMOX wafer beingspecified, the mean thickness of the buried oxide layeris from 50 nm to 500 nm. Following is an examplespecification: Mean buried oxide layer thickness for thefive sites will be 380 nm ± 20 nm with acceptablegoodness-of-fit at all five sites. Buried oxide uniformitywill be less than ± 10 nm.7.2 Crystallographic Defect Measurements - TestMethods  The evaluation of threading dislocationdensity in the top SI layer will be made by destructivechemical etching and microscopic etch pit densitymeasurements. The appropriate evaluation procedurefor given SIMOX wafer, which depends on thethreading dislocation density and the thickness of top Siand buried oxide layers, will be determined by theagreement between user and supplier.7.2.1 Optionally, other crystallographic defects whichmay be formed in the top Si layer of SIMOX wafers,such as oxide precipitates or micro stacking faults,silicon crystal defects induced by surface particles priorto epi growth when epi is used to increase the thicknessof the top silicon. A sampling plan should beestablished based on experience with the supplier.7.2.2 Following are examples of the evaluation ofthreading dislocations in two kinds of SIMOX wafers:7.2.2.1 Example 1. Threading dislocation evaluation inSIMOX wafers with 200 nm thick top Si layer and 400nm thick buried oxide: Samples are handled with plastictweezers throughout the etching procedure. Samples arefirst stripped of native oxide by dipping in Bell 2 or HFstripping solutions. Immediately after stripping, wafersare dipped in freshly prepared standard Secco Etch: onepart (by volume) of a 0.15 molar solution of K 2Cr 3O 7 indistilled water and two parts HF (49%). Samples aredipped in the Secco etch until 50 nm of silicon remains,and then they are rinsed thoroughly in distilled waterand blown dry. The thickness of the remaining siliconensures that stacking fault pyramids found in multipleimplant material are counted. The threading dislocationdensity may vary over a wide range, depending on the

&lt;!-- Page 36 --&gt;

SEMI M34-0299 © SEMI 1999 4 type of material. The Secco Etch, as described, createsetch pits that appear as dark circles roughly 50 nm indiameter, and pictures should be taken at 2500X to20,000X magnification in order to unambiguaouslyidentify and count the etch pits. This is suitable for highdensity defect samples. For lower dislocation densitiestypical of recent SIMOX material, a third etch in buffered HF (1 HF (49%): 6 NH 4F (40%)) for 10minutes will etch the buried oxide under each Seccoetch pit, creating a char-acteristic circular shape 2 min diameter that can be seen at 500X magnification. Figure 2Calibration Curves Relating Reflectance Measurements to Ellipsometry Measurements for Top Silicon andBuried Oxide Layer Thickness NOTE: Dashed lines are at ± 1 sigma and ± 3 sigma.

SEMI M34-0299 © SEMI 19995 7.2.2.2 Example 2. Threading dislocation eval-uationin SIMOX wafers with 170 nm thick top Si layer and100 nm thick buried oxide: Samples are first immersedin HF to remove oxide from the surface. Then thesamples are etched for 30 seconds in the solution:3 50ml of HF (49%) plus 80 ml of HNO 3 (61%) plus 160 mlof H 2 O \[K 2 Cr 2O 7 1g + Cu(NO3) 23H 2O 4g\]. Thethickness of removed silicon is about 1/3 of the initialtop Si layer thickness, i.e., about 60 nm. After rinsing inwater, samples are dipped in HF (49%) for 5 minutes.The HF etches the buried oxide and creates cavitiesunder the etch pits. The cavities are around 10 m indiameter. Each cavity corresponds to one dislocationthreading the top Si layer. The cavities can be seen at50X magnification.7.2.2.3 A recommended protocol for the micro-scopicetch pit density measurement is to take enough picturesto count at least 50 etch pits, and then divide thenumber counted by the area scanned to get the defectdensity. The pictures taken should be non-overlappingareas of the sample far from the tweezer marks and farfrom the edges of the sample. Following is an examplespecification: Of the five samples prepared from the testwafers, none should have threading dislocationdensities higher than 1  10 7 cm -2.7.3 Buried Oxide7.3.1 Buried Oxide Pinhole Measurements  Buriedoxide pinhole evaluations shall be made by CuS0 4plating or copper decoration methods.7.3.1.1 In the evaluation done by CuSO 4 platingmethod the wafer under study is placed (front facedown) on a paper towel soaked in 20% CuSO 4 solutionon top of a copper plate. An aluminum plate is placedon the back of the wafer. The copper plate is grounded,and -25 VDC is applied to the aluminum plate. Small(sub-micro Angstrom) leakage currents throughpinholes in the insulator cause copper to plate out ontothe towel at the pinhole density.7.3.1.2 In the evaluation done by copper decorationmethod the top Si layer is first etched off by KOHsolution to expose the buried oxide layer. Then thewafer is immersed in methanol and brought downwardinto direct contact with the gold-coated cathode. Acopper mesh as an anode is immersed in the liquid 5mm above the wafer. Required voltage is applied, suchas the electric field in the buried oxide layer is1MV/cm. The voltage is measured at the oxide surfacewith a surface voltage probe. Localized copperdecorations at pinhole sites in the oxide are observedwith a low power optical microscope. 3 Refer to L. F. Giles, A. Nejim, and P. L. F. Hemment, MaterialsChemistry and Physics, 1993, vol. 35, p. 129 7.3.1.3 Allowable pinhole density depends on theapplication for SIMOX wafer and will be determinedby the agreement between user and vendor. Typicalallowable pinhole density is 0.1/cm2.7.4 SIMOX Wafer Surface Inspection7.4.1 Total Reflectance X-Ray Fluorescence Mea-surements  The preferred test methodology isdescribed in ASTM F 1526.7.4.1.1 The instrument provides a map of impurityelement distribution. As an example specification,surface contamination for elements within the detectionlimits (typically S to Zn) shall be less than 10 10 cm-2 perelement or &lt; 10 11 cm-2 total.7.4.1.2 The customer and vendor should be aware thatmost TXRF systems will contaminate a wafer -slightlyon front and significantly on the back. (Reference:DXRC, Denver CO, July 1996, abstract 5.1 "ParticulateContamination from TXRF Instru-mentation", DennisWerho, et al.)7.4.2 Automated Particle Counter Measurements Automatic production tools are available for accurateparticle counting on fully processed SIMOX wafers forparticles greater than 0.25 micron. Alternatively,particles down to 0.1 micron can be detected on as-implanted SIMOX wafers prior to anneal. Anyspecification of particle count should include the pointin the process at which the measurement is to be made.Following is an example specification:7.4.2.1 Instrument settings shall allow detection ofparticles from 0.310 micron size. Maximum allow-able particle count, with a 6 mm edge exclusion, is 20particles greater than 0.25 micron size per 150 mmwafer, or 0.1 particles/cm2, just prior to shipping.7.4.3 Visual and Microscopic Inspection  Visualinspection techniques will be in accordance with ASTMF 523, when possible, by automatic inspectionequipment. Alternatively, slices will be inspectedvisually under fluorescent light for chips, fractures,scratches, fragmentation, saw marks, grinder marks,and dimples and also under a narrow beam highintensity light (&gt; 6000 footcandles), for fractures, filmhaze, contamination, and scratches. SIMOX waferstypically exhibit uniform light haze due to lightscattering from the rough silicon/oxide interface andfrom silicon precipitates in the BOX. A light, uniformhaze is typically acceptable, while patches of moderateor heavy haze typically are not acceptable.7.4.3.1 Standards for specification of haze are beingdeveloped for bulk silicon. A modification of thatspecification will be required for SIMOX material. Itmay be necessary to iterate between customer andvendor to agree on specification of acceptable haze.

SEMI M34-0299 © SEMI 1999 6 7.4.4 Surface Roughness  Surface roughness is ameasure of the microscopic topology of the wafersurface. The effect of this parameter may be in GateOxide Integrity (GOI) on MOS devices, depending onthe design and process. The measurement of surfaceroughness is done on an atomic scale by an AtomicForce Microscope (AFM). With AFM, it is suggestedthat four measurement areas of greater than 2 m2 bemeasured at each of five measurement locations, withthe measurement locations distributed as in Figure 1.Because of the expense of this measurement, asampling plan should be established with the supplier.7.4.4.1 Standards for specification of surface rough-ness are being developed for bulk silicon and shall beapplicable here when adopted.7.4.5 HF Defect Measurements - Test MethodsMeasurement of the microscopic etch pit densityfollowing an HF etch is a method commonly used todisclose defects in SOI material. Pitting of the topsilicon surface may be present before the HF etch or becaused by HF etching. For this destructivemeasurement, at least one quarter of a wafer should beused and preferably a whole wafer. The sample isplaced in concentrated (49%) HF for 10 to 15 minutes,then removed, rinsed and dried. If there are pits in theSI surface, metal particles embedded in the surface orsilicides formed in the top Si layer, the HF will etch themetals/silicides and then etch the buried oxide. Thisresults in a section of the buried oxide being etched outthat is 2550 m diameter (depending on the etch time)centered on the original pit or particle. The defectdensity is then measured in an optical microscope usinga 5X objective and 10X eyepiece or comparable setup.The sample should be scanned 23 times near thecenter of the wafer if a whole wafer is used to getsufficient statistics. If a piece of a wafer is used, thescan should be adjusted accordingly. The total areascanned should be at least 10 cm2. Care should be takento exclude edge density depending on the expectedimpact on yield versus material cost. A typicalspecification is that the HF defect density should be lessthan 1/cm2 .

Electrical Parameters8.1 Photoconductivity Lifetime  This is measured bycreating an excess of carriers (typically by using a lightsource) and measuring the slope of the decay curve.Several pieces of commercial equipment are availablefor this purpose. This requires that polysilicon is notdeposited on the backside, as is sometimes done forgettering. Also, surface passivation may be needed forlifetime measurements. Backside measurementsindicate the quality of the substrate and can beperformed by traditional methods. Frontsidemeasurements are more difficult and must be performed using incident light which can be entirely absorbedbefore reaching the underlying substrate.8.1.1 Typically, the sample is placed on a micro-wavewave guide post, forming part of a transmission linecircuit. The microwave reflection is determined by thetotal conductivity of the sample and the conductivity ismodulated by an intense light pulse. When the light isturned off, the microwave detects an exponential decayin conductivity from which a decay constant isdetermined. The photoconductivity lifetime is a resultof the recombination velocity at the surfaces, volumerecombination in the silicon layer, and any trapping.Measurements are made independently on the front and

&lt;!-- Page 41 --&gt;

SEMI M34-0299 © SEMI 19999 back sides of the wafer. The mean value on thebackside of the wafer will typically be at least 10microseconds for N-type material and 3 microsecondsfor P-type material. These values correspond to about a100 micron diffusion length (SPV value).8.1.2 The relevance of photoconductivity lifetime tothe users requirement should be discussed. The use ofthis measurement should be negotiated betweencustomer and vendor.8.2 BOX Breakdown  This parameter can bemeasured with a buried oxide capacitor (BOX-CAP).The buried oxide thickness and the intended applicationwill affect both the test procedure (such as capacitorarea and voltage criterion) and the allowable values ofmeasured parameters. These should be determined byagreement between the user and vendor. Exampleprocedure and values for standard evaluation of 400 nmthick buried oxide are given in the followingparagraphs.8.2.1 Test Structure  Buried oxide capacitor (BOX-CAP) having an area of 0.01 cm2 for standard (400 nm)BOX. The electrode material and thickness affect thebreakdown phenomena due to thermal effects, and soshould be included in the agreement between customerand vendor.8.2.2 Test Method: Staircase I-V Measurement Voltage is stepped in one-volt increments from zero to400 volts, or until destructive breakdown is sensed.Tests are done for both bias polarities. The test detectsthe onset of high field conduction, as well as the pointof destructive or massive charge injection and trapping.8.2.3 Typical ValuesJ ox &lt; 10 -8 A/cm2 at Eox = ± 2 MV/cm \[onset of hi-Eregime\]Eox &gt; 5 MV/cm at Jox = 0.01 A/cm2 \[break-down/injection\] 8.3 BOX Pinhole Density  This parameter can bemeasured with a buried oxide capacitor (BOX-CAP).The buried oxide thickness and the intended applicationwill affect both the test procedure (such as capacitorarea and voltage criterion) and the allowable values ofmeasured parameters. These should be determined byagreement between the user and vendor. Exampleprocedure and values for standard evaluation of 400 nmthick buried oxide are given in the followingparagraphs.8.3.1 Test Structure  Buried oxide capacitor havingan area equal to or greater than 0.05 cm2.8.3.2 Test Method: Staircase I-V  Measurementtesting can be done for both Type I and Type II defects where Type I defects are silicon pipes traversing theburied oxide, and Type II defects are local regions ofthin buried oxide. If Type II defect density is sought,capacitors are subjected to a series of 30 voltage stepsof 3.3 volts, with current monitored after each step,using a failure criterion of 1 nA.8.3.2.1 Arrays of at least 200 capacitors per wafer aretested. Bias polarity of the voltage ramp is chosen so asto accumulate the substrate portion of the capacitor(positive for n-silicon, negative for p-silicon).8.3.2.2 Type I defect density is determined using thesame test procedure, except that the failure currentcriterion is 1 .8.3.2.3 Any capacitor displaying the failure current ormore for voltages less than 100 volts is considereddefective. Defect density of either type is calculatedfrom the yield of good capacitors, (Y = 1  # failed/#tested), using Poisson statistics;D = -1n (Y)/A,where A is the total area of the capacitors tested. 8.3.2.4 For thin buried oxide (films less than 360 nm),the voltage criteria above need to be adjusted to accountfor the onset of high field conduction in defect-freecapacitors.8.3.3 ValuesD (Type I) &lt; = 0.2 defects/cm2 8.3.3.1 No standardized criterion for Type II defectshas been established.8.4 Buried Oxide Charge  This parameter can bemeasured with a buried oxide capacitor (BOX-CAP).The buried oxide thickness and the intended applicationwill affect both the test procedure (such as capacitorarea and voltage criterion) and the allowable values ofmeasured parameters. These should be determined byagreement between the user and vendor. Exampleprocedure and values for standard evaluation of 400 nmthick buried oxide are given in the followingparagraphs.8.4.1 Test Structure  Buried oxide capacitor havingan area of 0.01 cm2.8.4.2 Test Method  MOS high frequency C-Vmeasurement of a buried oxide capacitor normallyyields a flat band voltage less than one volt inmagnitude.

SEMI M35-1104 © SEMI 1999, 11041 SEMI M35-1104GUIDE FOR DEVELOPING SPECIFICATIONS FOR SILICON WAFERSURFACE FEATURES DETECTED BY AUTOMATED INSPECTION This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on August 16, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to bepublished November 2004. Originally published February 1999. 1 Purpose1.1 Inspection of silicon wafer surfaces is a standardoutgoing test on all commercially sold silicon wafers.1.2 Older specifications referred to visual inspection ofwafer surfaces, but with advanced technologies, thesizes of many important surface features are too smallto be seen visually and so other types of surfaceinspection become necessary.1.3 This guide provides a specification framework forreporting measurements of silicon wafer surfacefeatures through the use of scanning (or automated)surface inspection systems (SSIS). 2 Scope2.1 This guide addresses specifications related tolocalized light scatterers (LLSs) as well as extendedlight scatterers (XLSs). Examples of LLSs are particlesand pits. Examples of XLSs are scratches and regionsof high roughness (surface haze).2.2 Surface scanners, which have discriminatedbetween XLSs and LLSs for several years, are nowdiscriminating (and selectively reporting) betweendifferent types of LLSs (for example: pits andparticles).2.3 Specific numbers limiting feature levels and/ordensities are to be agreed upon between suppliers andcustomers. This guide provides a framework for thatcommunication.2.4 The resulting specifications will be flexible enoughto accommodate variations in measurement due todifferent SSIS models.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Discussion3.1 Discussion of LLS Measurement Issues3.1.1 Because there is considerable variation in thescatter characteristics of different LLSs, they have beenhistorically sized in latex sphere equivalents (LSE). Inother words, the signal received from an unknown LLSis equivalent to that which would be obtained from apolystyrene latex (PSL) sphere of known size.3.1.2 Automated scanning systems typically display amap of LLS location as well as a histogram of LSEsize.3.1.3 The instrumentation industry is building SSISsthat discriminate some LLSs from others based ondifferences in measured scatter that depend on featuresize, shape and material. This raises the question ofwhether identified LLSs should continue to be sizedusing latex sphere equivalents, or if some new (moreaccurate) standard would be more acceptable. Forexample, if an LLS signal could be identified as comingfrom a pit, then it might become appropriate to developa standard pit wafer. In this case, pits (eithermanufactured or found naturally) could be measuredvia atomic force microscope (AFM) and be madeavailable on a calibration wafer to size pits via theirmeasured scatter. Another option, would be to use amodel-based standard that resides in the SSIS software.3.2 Discussion of XLS Measurement Issues3.2.1 Identification of scratches is typically done (inpart) through software that identifies a string ofconnected LLS signals. Defects with dimensions suchthat the length is at least five times the width aredefined as scratches. Customers and suppliers mayagree on scratch aspect ratios different from 5:1. SSISsoftware often provides a customer-settable aspectratio, as well as a minimum overall length, as criteriafor classification of an SSIS defect or group of defectsas a scratch. Depending on SSIS design, scratchsensitivity may also be a function of scratch orientation.Currently, scratch signals are also calibrated in latexsphere equivalents; however, in the future it maybecome useful to calibrate scratch signals with astandard obtained from a scratch that has been either

&lt;!-- Page 44 --&gt;

SEMI M35-1104 © SEMI 1999, 2004 2 manufactured to a known size, or has been measuredvia AFM.3.2.2 Haze is specified as parts per million (ppm) ofmeasured scattered optical power relative to theincident optical power on the surface. All of theassociated measurement conditions must be given (orimplied) with the specified haze value. Theseconditions include: source incident angle (measured asa polar angle from surface normal), source polarization(S, P, other), source wavelength (or wavelength band),nominal source spot size at the wafer, haze collectionangles (given as solid angles with directions). All ofthese quantities must be part of a haze specification,either by description, or by implication to specificinstrumentation (with known or fixed parameters).3.2.3 Haze is quantified by measuring scattered lightpower over one or more solid angles and thennormalizing by the light power incident on the surface.It is nothing more than the diffuse reflectance of asurface in specified directions for a known source(incident angle, polarization, spot size, wavelengthband) and receiver (or detector) configuration (solidangles and locations). Measured haze can be expectedto change if the surface is changed, or if any of themeasurement parameters change.3.2.4 Under special conditions, where the source of thehaze is known, it may be possible to use a model topredict the haze reading on one instrument from thehaze reading on another. For example, if on the basis ofproduct experience and measurements on a few wafers,the surface power spectral density function can bedetermined, then the haze due to surface roughness canbe calculated for an instrument with differentparameters. Haze caused by a large number of smallparticles and/or film contamination is more difficult tomodel.3.2.5 An SSIS often reports haze as the arithmeticaverage of a grid of local haze measurements taken overthe FQA. This average can be, and often is, biased bywafer haze distributions that exhibit long, positivelyskewed tails. SSIS software is being developed thatautomatically calculates other haze statistics, such asthe median haze value, the standard deviation of thehaze distribution, and so on.3.3 The SSIS used for automated inspection of siliconwafer surfaces should be calibrated in terms of latexsphere equivalents in accordance with SEMI M53 oranother method agreed upon between supplier andcustomer. 4 Limitations4.1 The following measurement considerations imposelimitations on the guidelines. 4.1.1 Histograms calculated in latex sphere equivalentsmay be distorted, because a given surface has in generalLLSs of different size, shape, and material.4.1.2 Measurement results do not always compare wellbetween systems, because different SSIS designsemploy different geometries and gather light scatteredin different directions. Haze maps may have differentlevels and localized surface features may have differentcalculated sizes.4.1.3 All scanning systems have a minimum LSE sizeof LLSs that can be reliably mapped and sized. Thelimitation is due to a combination of system electricalnoise and the detection of non-particle light scattersignals, such as those created by Rayleigh scatter,surface roughness and system optics. Operation nearthis noise floor limits the utility of this guide for LLSsof those sizes.4.1.4 Measurements made near the wafer edge oftenresult in large numbers of false counts called edge blast.These counts are caused by small amounts of stray lightpropagating near the incident beam that scatter from therelatively rough wafer edge back into the detectoroptics. Under certain combinations of sensitivity andedge exclusion, light scattered from these effects maycause false counts within the FQA.4.1.5 Types of LLS signals that may be mis-identifiedas scratches include lines of particles, pits, false counts,stacking faults, slip, and spin dry residue.4.1.6 Closely spaced features may be counted as asingle scattering event because the scanning spot size isgenerally much larger than the feature diameter.4.1.7 Scratch orientation usually affects scannerresponse. Thus the minimum detectable scratch cross-section may vary with orientation. 5 Referenced Standards5.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specifications for Polished Mono-crystalline Polished Silicon WafersSEMI M53  Practice for Calibrating ScanningSurface Inspection Systems using Depositions ofMonodisperse Polystyrene Latex Sphere onUnpatterned Semiconductor Wafer SurfacesNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions.
