In theory, most possible combinations of theelements in the input gases may be found ascompounds in the exhaust. In practice, the maincomponents will be the unused process gas (thepercentage consumed in the process varies, and

&lt;!-- Page 9 --&gt;

SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 20013 may be as low as 10%). Additional by-productswill have different and sometimes more hazardousproperties.7.2 Considerable research has been conducted intovarious hazardous by-products of processes, fromexplosive solids to organochlorine compounds withmutagenic properties. (See Sections 13.1 through13.3.)7.3 In considering selection of exhaust systems andabatement technology, it is essential to review all thematerials likely to be present in the exhaust.7.4 Contributions from the materials on the wafer mustalso be considered, as they often cause blockedexhausts (e.g., aluminum etches produce aluminumchloride (a by-product of removal of aluminum fromthe wafer with chlorinated gases)).7.5 Processes that produce specific hazardous by-products should be evaluated for appropriate point-of-use abatement technology before discharge to anexhaust system.7.6 Gaseous and particulate contaminants emitted fromsemiconductor manufacturing can be dividedconveniently into nine major groups, each of whichmight justify its own exhaust system.7.6.1 Group-1 Acid  Easily hydrolyzable acids, (e.g.,hydrogen chloride hydrolyzes into hydrochloric acid.)7.6.2 Group-2 Acid aerosols (difficultto-scrub) This group includes acids that generate aerosols andthat are not easily removed by simple water scrubbers(e.g., aqua regia, sulfuric and nitric).NOTE 2: High concentrations of easily soluble acids will alsofall into the difficult-to-scrub category.7.6.3 Group-3 Ammonia  Exhaust streamscontaining ammonia7.6.4 Group-4 Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) Exhausts containing volatile organic compoundvapors or flammable gas discharge requiringdestruction.7.6.5 Group-5 Pyrophoric  Exhausts containingpyrophoric gases.7.6.6 Group-6 Emergency Release Discharges Enclosures are provided with additional exhausts tocontain sudden unanticipated releases of gas fromcylinders, etc.7.6.7 Group-7 Special/Direct  Additional exhaustsused to keep specific gases separate for recoverypurposes (e.g., hydrogen (H 2) reclamation from EPI orPFC reclamation from CVD tools, Oxides of Nitrogen(NO x)). 7.6.8 Group-8 General Exhaust Systems without End-of-Pipe Treatment  Exhaust of heat or post-treatmentexhaust from POU abatement systems.7.6.9 Group-9 Highly Toxic Gas Exhaust  Highlytoxic gases especially those with poor warningproperties (e.g., arsine, phosphine, diborane, germane).The end user has a primary responsibility to preventdischarge of these gases above a regulated level (e.g.,usually one-half (1/2) of Immediately Dangerous toLife and Health (IDLH) levels).NOTE 3: Facility exhaust systems may be called by a numberof different names such as: Acid, Corrosive, Ammonia,Scrubbed, VOC, Solvent, Incinerated, Highly Toxic, Toxic,Dedicated, Special, PFC, General, Heat, Treated, or others.The actual facility exhaust system name, and what groups arerouted to each system, will vary by factory and by country.7.7 The groups listed in Section 7.6 are not a definitivedivision, but represent a summation of commonindustry practice for separation. The division is basedon three basic principles: avoiding mixing of incompatible gases in theexhaust, potential need for different end-of-pipe abatementtechnologies, and, keeping materials separate for recovery.7.8 The number of separate exhaust systems used isentirely a decision for each facility, based on thefollowing: processes and chemicals used, the number of each type of process, whether recovery of gases is required, whether point-of-use (POU) abatement is installed,and compatibility of emissions with each other or theeffluent handling system.7.9 In theory, if POU abatement systems are fitted toall sources of gaseous effluent all exhaust could then becombined into a single exhaust system.7.9.1 In practice most facilities operate a compromisebetween the two extremes with two to four separateexhaust systems and point-of-use abatement systemsfitted only to certain sources. The decision (as to whichcombination to use) will often be based on economicand space constraints.7.9.2 Safety and environmental factors listed below,should always be considered first when determiningspecific gaseous sources that require POU abatementsystems.

SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 2001 4 7.10 Many types of process equipment use and exhaustincompatible gases sequentially (e.g., silane and thennitrogen trifluoride (NF3) as elements of a depositionand cleaning cycle).7.10.1 With more than one of these processes beingdischarged asynchronously into a common exhaustduct, undesired reactions may occur.7.10.2 It is possible to avoid this problem by fitting theequipment outlet with three-way valves to divert thedischarge to the correct exhaust system, depending onequipment process step. Three-way valves may not benecessary if pump ballast-gas flow is increased to dilutegases.7.10.2.1 Switching must accurately account for the gastransmission times from process chamber inlet to theexhaust valve.7.10.2.2 Introduction of additional mechanical devicescould create major hazards, reliability, and service ormaintenance issues.7.10.2.3 Valves must incorporate failsafe designs toensure pump outlet is not shut off.7.10.3 An alternative solution is to fit a local POUabatement system that treats at least one component andis not adversely affected by the other components.7.11 Point-of-Use (POU) Abatement Devices7.11.1 POU abatement devices are designed to operateat the process tool or pump outlet, and to removehazardous gases BEFORE they enter the exhaustductwork.7.11.2 An end-of-pipe scrubber does not protect thefacility from reactions in the ductwork. Reactionsbetween process gases, as discussed above, or reactionswith other process by-products within the ductworkitself are not prevented by end-of-pipe systems either.7.11.3 POU abatement devices may be appropriatewherever the exhaust gases can react in the ductwork.7.11.4 If process systems are not treated with POUabatement devices, the higher concentrations ofhazardous gases will present a higher risk during a leakinto the facility space.7.11.5 Improperly functioning POU abatement devicescan create backpressure that can increase the risk of aleak.7.12 Four significant consequences can be foreseenfrom effluent gas reactions in the ductwork:7.12.1 Blocked Ducts  Reactions between gases, orcondensation of vapors, can produce solids and semi-solids (such as crystals, slurries or gels) that will blockthe ductwork. 7.12.1.1 Collection of solids can create dead legsections that may contain reactive byproducts or unusedraw materials. Catastrophic release of these trappedmaterials could generate a significant hazard.7.12.1.2 Extensive downtime (for clean out, or ductscollapsing under the weight of accumulated solids) is apossible undesirable outcome of this condition.7.12.1.3 Solids deposited (such as from metal etching)can, themselves, be both corrosive and hazardous,leading to health risks for people performing cleaningin ductwork.

SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 20015 8 End-of-Pipe Abatement Technologies8.1 Group 1  Acid Abatement8.1.1 The appropriate abatement technology for thiscategory is commonly called "wet scrubbing."8.1.2 Many, if not all, of the semiconductor processeshave traditionally been exhausted through centralizedwet scrubbers.8.1.2.1 This procedure has limited technicalacceptability and may not meet the requirements of allregulatory agencies.8.1.2.2 This technology should be targeted atabatement of acid gases, vapors, mists, and fumesemitted from CVD, dry etching, and wet chemicaloperations.8.1.2.3 Most wet chemical processes are typicallycarried out under local exhaust ventilation devices, suchas fume hoods, or in specially designed rooms that aretotally exhausted. These types of operations include: Processes used to clean wafers or clean waferhandling equipment (such as quartz components,tubing), Processes used in wafer fabrication for surfacetreatment such as oxide, silicon nitride and othersurface treatments, (e.g., metal etching), and Processes used for development of positivephotoresist.8.1.2.4 The chemical species emitted depends on boththe chemicals used in the processes and the conditionsof use.8.1.2.5 Volatile acids (e.g., hydrochloric (HCl),hydrofluoric, nitric, and acetic) yield correspondinggases and vapors, especially when heated.8.1.2.5.1 The reaction of hydrochloric and nitric acidsin aqua regia yields nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) vapor andelemental chlorine (Cl2) gas.8.1.2.5.2 When sulfuric acid is heated, it yields bothsulfuric acid vapor (H 2SO 4) and sulfur trioxide (SO3).8.1.2.5.3 Phosphoric acid (H3PO 4) is not significantlyvolatile, but spray may be carried over into the exhaustsystem by mechanical entrainment.8.1.2.5.4 Under appropriate conditions, spray dropletsof any of the chemicals used may be mechanicallyentrained into the ventilation air exhausted from thevarious processes.8.1.3 Design and selection of scrubbing equipment forthe acid exhaust systems must take into account both the chemical and physical properties of the materialsbeing emitted.8.1.4 The principles involved in collection ofparticulate matter (including liquid aerosols) areentirely different from those determining absorption ofgases.8.1.5 Current Practice8.1.5.1 Exhausts carrying acid compounds comprisethe largest volume of air discharged from a typicalsemiconductor manufacturing plant.8.1.5.2 The current practice is to connect most or all ofthe corrosive sources to a central building exhaustsystem and to discharge the combined gas streams toone or more large wet scrubbers.8.1.5.2.1 A variety of scrubber types might be used,but the two main types are cross-flow and counter-current scrubbers equipped with packing material ofsome type.8.1.5.3 The scrubbers usually are fed with a stream ofwater (potable, recycled, etc.).8.1.5.4 A side stream of water is bled from thescrubber to a wastewater line.8.1.5.5 It is futile to discharge organic solvents towater scrubbers even if the organic solvents are, tosome degree, soluble in water.8.1.5.5.1 Any dissolved organic solvent will eventuallybe desorbed from the water and will escape to theatmosphere, or be discharged as wastewater.Additionally, these organics could serve to propagatebiological growth in the scrubber.8.1.5.6 Exhausts from process tools are frequentlydischarged to the appropriate building exhaust systems,either with or without point-of-use abatement.8.1.5.7 Arsine and phosphine, which have only slightsolubility in water, pass through the water scrubbers sothat the effect of discharging these gases into thebuilding scrubber system is limited to dilution.Fluorine and chlorine also have limited solubility inwater and may pass through water scrubbers withoutsufficient abatement. POU abatement devices shouldbe considered for these types of gases.8.1.5.8 Preliminary oxidation of these and numerousother process gases results in formation of fine fumesand other aerosols that will be collected with only lowefficiencies by the typical large, low-energy wetscrubbers.8.1.5.9 If ammonia is discharged into a system thatalso carries hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, nitricacid, or sulfuric acid; it will react, in the vapor phase, to

&lt;!-- Page 12 --&gt;

SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 2001 6 form sub-micron solid aerosols of ammonium chloride,ammonium fluoride, ammonium nitrate, or ammoniumsulfate, respectively.8.1.5.10 Any exhausts carrying ammonia should bedischarged to a separate scrubber or a point-of-useammonia abatement used at the process discharge.8.1.6 Chemistry of Pollutants8.1.6.1 Effective abatement of any compound requirescareful consideration of the chemistries and physicalstates of the specific compounds being abated.8.1.6.2 The packed-bed scrubbers commonly employedshould generally be adequate for absorption of readilysoluble gases, if appropriate operating conditions arealso maintained.8.1.6.3 Misuse can negate the potential performance ofthe scrubbers.8.1.6.4 As scrubbers are low-energy devices (pressuredrops on the order of 2.5 to 10 cm (1-4 inches) of water,they are incapable of effectively collecting fine aerosolssuch as the ammonium salts mentioned above.8.1.6.5 The most economic design approach, therefore,is to arrange the exhaust system and use POUabatement devices to avoid formation of such aerosols,where possible.8.1.6.6 The practice of using only recirculated water inthe scrubber, to absorb acid vapors and to neutralize thewater bleed stream should be reviewed to ensure thatscrubber efficiency is not affected.8.1.6.7 Acid gases, such as hydrogen chloride andhydrogen fluoride, are readily soluble in water. Thepartial pressure of acid gases in equilibrium with thesolution, which increases with increasing soluteconcentration, reduces the absorption of additional gas.Reduction in absorption can be minimized byincreasing the rate of water blow-down (i.e., using morefresh water make-up).8.1.6.8 However, increasing the rate proportionatelyincreases the consumption of water and the volume ofwater that must be treated before discharge aswastewater.8.1.6.9 The introduction of an alkaline solution (e.g.,sodium hydroxide) in the scrubber can assist inremoving compounds from the gas stream if the use ofwater alone does not provide adequate removalefficiencies. The use of additives in the scrubber can, initself, create safety and environmental concerns.8.1.6.10 Some of the neutralized absorbent must bebled off from the recirculated stream to prevent thebrine concentration from reaching an excessively high level, but water consumption and the volume of wastecan still be reduced by alkaline solution.8.1.6.11 Aqua regia is a reactive mixture of nitric andhydrochloric acids. The reaction produces nitrosylchloride and elemental chlorine:HNO3 + 3HCl  NOCl + Cl2 + 2H2O8.1.6.12 The nitrosyl chloride vapor is readilydecomposed by absorption in an alkaline solution:NOCl + 2NaOH  NaNO 2 + NaCl + H2O8.1.6.13 Elemental chlorine has only a limitedsolubility in water, and an alkaline solution (pH &gt; 10)must be used to attain adequate absorption efficiencies:Cl2 + 2NaOH  NaOCl + NaCl + H2O8.1.6.14 During the initial reaction of the nitric andhydrochloric acids, hydrogen chloride gas and nitricacid vapors are volatilized along with the nitrosylchloride and chlorine.8.1.6.15 Nitrogen dioxide may also be produced bydecomposition of nitric acid.8.1.6.16 All these compounds can be absorbed, tosome degree, in an alkaline solution.8.1.6.17 If a pollutant is in a particulate form (solid orliquid), its collection is only slightly affected by itschemical nature or solubility.8.1.6.18 The dominant factor determining particulatecollectability is particle size.8.1.6.19 Abatement of particulate compounds requiresa high-energy method (usually creating an extremelyhigh pressure-drop across the abatement device) whichcan be costly in both energy and abatement device sizerequirements.8.1.7 Scrubber Design and Selection8.1.7.1 A variety of commercially available scrubbersare applicable to absorption of readily soluble gases.8.1.7.2 These include packed-bed counter-current, co-current, and horizontal cross-flow scrubbers, horizontalspray chambers, vertical spray towers, and gas-atomizing scrubbers such as the venturi scrubber.8.1.7.3 To some extent, the choice of scrubber type is amatter of preference, as it is usually possible to obtainequivalent performance on the soluble gases withdifferent types of devices; however, more packing orhigher liquid loading may be required on some devices.8.1.8 The choice is likely to be limited by aconsideration of practical or economic factors such ascost, available space, and weight (e.g., it is possible to

&lt;!-- Page 13 --&gt;

SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 20017 reduce the size of the scrubber, usually at the cost ofincreased energy consumption).NOTE 5: See Appendix 1 for absorber design criteria.8.2 Group 2  Acid Aerosols8.2.1 Part of acid emissions may be in the form ofmists (fine droplets or aerosols) rather than gases.These may be composed of relatively non-volatile acidssuch as phosphoric and sulfuric acids.8.2.1.1 The mechanisms of removal of particulatematter (including liquid aerosols) from gas streams areentirely different from those involved in the absorptionof gases (See Sections 13.1 through 13.3).8.2.1.2 The critical factor in the collection process isthe particle size of the mist. If the mist is relativelycoarse, as apparently is the case in most instances, thesame types of scrubbers that are used for gas absorptionshould collect the mists with adequate efficiency.8.2.1.3 If a mist having a particle size in themicrometer or sub-micrometer range is encountered, itwill be necessary to use a high-energy scrubber or ascrubber with a high-pressure-drop, sub-micron filter toobtain adequate collection efficiency.8.2.1.4 Whenever such a fine mist or other aerosol isencountered, the gas stream from the source should beabated at point-of-use or separately from the otherexhaust gas streams in the plant so as to minimizeenergy costs.8.2.1.5 Abatement systems utilizing a scrubber with ahigh-pressure-drop, sub-micron filter are being used inthe semiconductor industry to reduce emissions fromaqua-regia processes, hot nitric baths and spray etchersusing nitric acid (entrained in exhaust).8.2.2 It has been determined experimentally that thecollection efficiency of a scrubber on a given mist ordust is a function of the energy consumed in theexposure of the particle to the liquid in the scrubbingprocess.8.2.2.1 The relationship between energy consumptionand efficiency is little affected by the geometry or sizeof the scrubber or by the method by which the energy isapplied to making contact between the gas and theliquid (See Sections 13.1 through 13.3).8.2.2.2 The energy consumption required to attain agiven efficiency increases with a decrease in the size ofthe aerosol (e.g., mist or dust). In most of the scrubbersused in the semiconductor industry, the energyconsumed is drawn from the gas stream in the form ofpressure drop.8.2.3 The energy/efficiency relationship provides aconvenient and practical method for particle and aerosol scrubber design. It is essentially independent ofthe size of the scrubber, at least down to a very smallsize (perhaps 150 to 300 L/min (510 ft3/min) capacity,and possibly even smaller). Hence, a small pilot unitcan be used to determine performance on an actualplant exhaust stream.8.2.3.1 Tests can also be made under laboratoryconditions, using synthetic aerosols generated for thepurpose.8.2.3.2 The major problem in using synthetic aerosolsis in replicating the aerosols actually encountered inpractice.8.2.3.3 The pilot plant scrubber should be tested over arange of pressure drops to give a well-defined pressuredrop/efficiency correlation.8.3 Group 3  Ammonia8.3.1 Ammonia gas (NH 3) can be either a process gasor evolved from ammonium hydroxide used in wetchemical cleaning of wafers. As previously discussed,ammonia (NH 3) exhausted through the acid system willreact with the acids present producing an ammoniumsalt aerosol that is not easily abated.8.3.1.1 Packed-bed scrubbers are not very efficient atremoving sub-micron ammonium halide aerosols, eventhough they are water-soluble.8.3.2 Wet scrubber technologies, as listed above, aresuitable for removal of ammonia provided they areoperated and maintained at low pH (e.g., 35).8.3.2.1 This is normally achieved by the use of sulfuricacid dosing.8.3.3 Processes that emit both ammonia and acid gases(such as nitride deposition) should be fitted with apoint-of-use ammonia scrubber, prior to beingexhausted to the acid exhaust.8.4 Group 4  Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)8.4.1 VOCs can represent a large proportion ofexhausted air streams within typical semiconductoroperations. The pollutants are produced from processessuch as solvent cleaning, and photoresist applicationand stripping. Such processes typically contributeflammable, hazardous, and/or environmentally harmfulcompounds (e.g., VOCs, which participate in ozoneformation in the atmosphere) to the exhausted airstream.8.4.2 There are three primary abatement technologiesused at end of pipe for this category: adsorption,recovery and oxidation. Adsorption generally useshydrophobic zeolite or activated carbon. The oxidationprocess usually is thermal or may be catalytic.

&lt;!-- Page 14 --&gt;

SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 2001 8 8.4.3 Emission Sources and Chemicals Emitted8.4.3.1 VOCs usually have high vapor pressures andcan be hazardous, flammable, or may tend to formphotochemical smog. Processes using them (such assolvent cleaning, photoresist application, vapordegreasing and photoresist stripping) are carried outunder local exhaust hoods or in exhausted enclosures.8.4.3.2 Chemicals emitted may include: acetone, ethylbenzene, ethyl lactate, hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS),isopropyl alcohol, methanol, methyl ethyl ketone(MEK), n-butyl acetate, n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone(NMP), petroleum distillates (VM&P naphtha),propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA)and xylenes.8.4.3.3 The chemical species emitted are typicallyvapors of the specific VOCs being used. These vaporsare entrained in large volume air streams and are thusdiluted to low levels.8.4.4 Current Practices8.4.4.1 New regulations and proposed legislation,being implemented worldwide, require significantreductions in total VOC emissions (often measured interms of mass discharged).8.4.4.2 Removal of VOCs from exhaust streams can beaccomplished by adsorption, (e.g., fluidized bed andconcentrator systems), oxidation, or a combination ofadsorption and oxidation systems. Adsorptiontechnologies, with subsequent desorption andcondensation, can be used to recover VOCs as a liquid.8.4.4.3 End-of-pipe abatement is most commonly usedfor VOCs. Point-of-use systems, using the sametechnologies as end-of-pipe, are employed whereexhaust facilities preclude use of an end-of-pipe unit, oras additional abatement to meet regulatoryrequirements.NOTE 6: See Appendix 1 for VOC abatement design andselection criteria.8.5 Group 5  Pyrophoric Gases8.5.1 Where separate exhausts for pyrophoric gaseshave been installed, it has been practice to fit a large airdilution chamber at the end of pipe. The reasoning hasbeen that this will ensure safety by dilution and result inoxidation of any residual pyrophoric gases. However,oxidation may not occur since research has shown thatsilane, once diluted to &lt;1.5 % in nitrogen, does notundergo appreciable oxidation when subsequentlymixed with air.8.5.2 Due to the risks associated with ductingpyrophoric gases through a facility, it is stronglyrecommended that these gases be abated at point-of- use. This avoids the need for a separate pyrophoric gasexhaust. If POU abatement is provided, the dischargefrom the POU abatement system can be directed to theacid or general exhaust system.NOTE 7: See Appendix 2 for POU abatement of pyrophoricgases.8.6 Group 6  See section 10 for Emergency ReleaseDischarge Exhaust provisions.8.7 Group-7  Special/Direct8.7.1 Recovery of specific gases such as hydrogen (H2)may be necessary to reduce the massive risk of duct firewhen large quantities of flammable gases aredischarged.8.7.2 PFC reclamation maybe required byenvironmental permits in some jurisdictions.8.7.3 Abatement of Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx ) may benecessary to meet environmental regulations in somejurisdictions.8.8 Group 8  General Exhaust8.8.1 This exhaust group is used to handle exhaustemissions that include heat and excessive nitrogen flow.8.8.2 Heat exhaust is used to reduce the heat load onthe balance of the building.8.8.3 Exhaust of large volumes of nitrogen or otherasphyxiant gas is used to keep potential asphyxiationhazards away from people.8.8.4 Discharge from general exhaust should be to alocation where the heat or reduced oxygen will not be ahazard to personnel.8.8.5 General exhaust can sometimes be used fordischarge of post-treatment emissions from POUabatement systems.8.8.5.1 In such a case, the discharge permit for thePOU abatement system should be consulted for propermanagement.8.9 Group 9  Highly Toxic Gases8.9.1 Gases such as arsine, phosphine, diborane,germane, etc., can be treated in a variety of ways,depending upon their concentration and theirbyproducts (e.g., gas reactor columns, adsorptionsystems).8.9.2 These gases would not likely be allowed in aburn system (even though many of them might bepyrophoric) because they could release hydrides fromthe air intake.

&lt;!-- Page 15 --&gt;

SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 20019 8.9.3 These gases may be prohibited, in somejurisdictions, from being discharged with no othertreatment than dilution.8.9.4 Highly toxic gases have also been known tocreate problems in a thermal oxidation system, becauseof the residue they leave behind and the periodic needfor personnel to clean oxidation systems.8.9.5 Selectors of systems for discharge of highly toxicgases should be careful to meet all regulatoryrequirements and should be conscious of the dischargelocation for the emission residue. 9 Point-of-Use (POU) Abatement Technologies9.1 The selection of a suitable POU abatement deviceis dependent on the process exhaust gases to be abated.9.2 To determine a valid abatement method, identifythe exhaust composition from the process as well as theinput process gases in order to select a suitableabatement technology.9.3 The choice may also depend on other factors (e.g.,whether removal of PFC gases is required or not).9.4 The location of a POU abatement system in theprocess exhaust train must be reviewed for pressuredrop, condensation, particles, moisture backstreaming,etc.9.5 Many types of POU abatement devices areavailable and they can broadly be divided into six typesof technologies listed below.1. Wet scrubbing systems,2. Oxidation systems,3. Cold bed systems (adsorbers/ chemisorbers),4. Hot chemical bed systems,5. Reactor systems (e.g., plasma, microwave),6. Traps/filters/cyclones/precipitators,NOTE 8: See Appendix 2 for explanations of each technologytype.9.6 Units may employ one or more of thesetechnologies, depending on the application.9.7 Where a technology using an exhaustiblecartridge/canister is employed, consideration must begiven to adequate means of detecting bed exhaustionand to proper disposal techniques. 10 Provisions For Emergency Release10.1 Routine releases, from hazardous gas cylindersand sources are usually minimal (e.g., from gas linepurges). 10.2 Emergency or accidental releases, from gascylinders in use, may be controlled through mechanicalsystems that lower the frequency, time and rate ofreleases.10.3 Enclosing gas cylinders and non-weldedmechanical fittings in exhausted gas cabinets thatprotect the systems from damage can minimize thefrequency of accidental releases.10.3.1 Proper design and installation of gas deliveryand purge systems can reduce the likelihood of severeleaks.10.4 The duration of accidental releases can belessened by activation of fail-closed valves or gascylinder closure devices activated by monitoring and/oralarm systems.10.5 Equipping gas cylinders with restrictive floworifices can lower the rate of accidental release. SEMIS5 - Safety Guideline for Flow Limiting Devicesprovides guidance on the use of restrictive flowdevices.10.6 Exhaust of the gas cabinets should be designed tocontain sudden unanticipated releases of gas fromcylinders and piping.10.6.1 These exhausts are typically used to manage gascabinets and other very high volume exhaust flowsystems that will only occasionally have emissionspresent.10.6.2 Some jurisdictions do not allow for dischargewithout treatment of emergency release discharges.10.7 Each system selector should research their ownregulations before determining the proper route andmethod for discharging and treating emergencyreleases.10.8 Accidental releases from gas cylinders in use maybe controlled through mechanical systems that lowerthe concentration exhausted into the environment. Insome jurisdictions there are requirements (e.g.,Uniform Fire Code, Article 80) to lower theconcentration of accidental release, in exhaust to theenvironment, below a threshold (such as one-half (1/2)of Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH)levels).10.8.1 Dilution air, in excess of otherwise required gascabinet exhaust, can be used to reduce the concentrationof gas accidentally released into the exhaust, exceptwhere a jurisdiction specifically prohibits this practice.10.8.2 As another method to reduce the concentrationof gas in the atmospheric discharge during accidentalreleases, abatement devices serving the gas cabinet

&lt;!-- Page 16 --&gt;

If possible, use ofthe hazardous materials should be avoided. In theorythe following approach should be used:12.1.1 Replace the hazardous material with one that isnon-hazardous or less hazardous.12.1.2 If replacement is not possible, use less of thematerial.12.1.3 If possible, totally enclose the system so allmaterial is recovered and reused.12.1.4 If none of the above can be achieved, fiteffective abatement devices. 13 Related DocumentsNOTE 9: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents citedshall be the latest published versions.13.1 SEMATECH Documents3 TT97093364A-XFR  Point-of-Use (POU) ControlSystems for Semiconductor Process Emissions(ESHC003), October 30, 1997, J.

Additionally, the typical scrubber with99+% theoretical removal efficiency was actuallyachieving removal efficiencies ranging from 80%95%.A1-2.5 Scrubbers being applied to corrosive pollutantsare usually standardized units assembled by a numberof vendor companies. These units are designed tohandle specified ranges of gas flow, but in otherrespects are not designed but simply built. If they arepacked-bed scrubbers, they are usually fitted withstandard depths of packing. The liquid flow rates canbe varied within limits; but otherwise, the performancepotentials are fixed unless there are provisions forchanging the depth of packing and perhaps the kind ofpacking. Once the system is installed, such changes toincrease the efficiency will probably increase the

&lt;!-- Page 19 --&gt;

SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 200113 pressure drop of the scrubber, which will require addingto the fan capacity.A1-2.6 To ensure, in advance, that the scrubber willhave adequate removal efficiency, performance testscan be conducted. Measurements should be made ofthe contaminant concentrations in typical plant exhaustgas streams, and the resulting data should be used to setconservative performance requirements for thescrubber. Performance tests on the scrubber should beconducted prior to exposing the scrubber to thesemiconductor plant exhaust, preferably at the vendorsfacility. Performance tests should identify the criticaloperating variables and optimize the settings to achieveoptimal removal efficiencies at the lowest cost.A1-2.6.1 Onsite performance tests may be preferable,when qualifying abatement systems, so that accurateprocess conditions can be produced. Permit exemptionsmay be obtained for the time-period of systemqualification.A1-2.7 Design and construction of scrubbers aresimplified by two factors: the exhaust gas streams are atessentially ambient temperature, and they carry fewinsoluble solids. The low temperature allows use ofcorrosion-resistant plastic construction. The absence ofsignificant solids avoids blockages in the scrubbers,which favors use of efficient gas-liquid contactors suchas packed beds.A1-2.8 Two of the most favored scrubber types are thecounter-current packed tower and the horizontal cross-flow scrubber. In some instances, the choice betweenthese devices may be determined by plant layout. Asusually constructed, these two scrubber types have lowto moderate gas pressure drops and are primarily suitedto absorption of gases. They will also collect thecoarser mists and sprays but are unsuited to collectionof fine mists and fumes having particle sizes under 2 to3 micrometers.A1-2.9 In principle, the counter-current tower offersthe highest efficiency with the least consumption ofabsorbent liquid. However, if untreated water isrecirculated through the tower, as is commonly done insemiconductor plants, the advantages of thecountercurrent operation are lost. On the other hand, ifthe absorbed gas is reacted with an appropriate reagentin the water, essentially the same performance can beobtained with either the countercurrent or co-currentoperation (see Section A1-1.7). In co-current operation,it is possible to use higher gas velocities to obtainhigher mass transfer rates so that the scrubber can bemade smaller. Gas pressure drops will also beincreased, but this may be desirable if it is necessary tocollect a fine aerosol as well as absorb a gas. A1-2.10 Horizontal cross-flow packed-bed scrubbersmay have advantages where the installation imposesrestrictions on height or other similar layout problems.However, in other respects, they do not offerfundamental advantages over the packed towerscrubbers.A1-2.11 Under special circumstances, other types ofscrubbers may be appropriate for collection of aerosols.High-energy scrubbers, of the venturi type, or scrubberswith high-pressure drop, sub-micron filters (e.g., fiberbed) are appropriate where fine aerosols must becollected. Wherever possible, measures should betaken to avoid formation of such aerosols; but whenthey are unavoidably produced, the source should beventilated through a separate scrubbing system ofappropriate design.A1-2.12 Packing in scrubbers provides a largeinterfacial area between the liquid and the gas, and alsoinduces fluid turbulence to promote mass transfer.Packing is commonly placed in scrubbers in a randommanner. Raschig and Pall rings as well as Berl saddleswere common early packing materials used. In recentyears, numerous proprietary packing designs have beenintroduced, with the objective of providing increasedmass-transfer efficiency with reduced gas pressuredrop. The validity of claims for superior performancehas been established by the SEMATECH experimentsin Section 13.1.A1-2.13 Numerous precautions are required wheninstalling and operating packed-bed scrubbers. It isessential to attain an even distribution of liquid over thepacking; channeling of liquid or gas flow results in lossof removal efficiency. Inadequate liquid distributioncan result in a reduction of the removal efficiency to aslittle as one seventh of theoretical (See ReferencedDocument A1-1.9). The predominant liquiddistribution system employed is spray nozzle style.This style is inexpensive, however, it is difficult tomaintain and tends to entrain more water than weir-style. Weir-style liquid distribution systems are moreexpensive. However, they require less preventivemaintenance, provide equal liquid distribution over awide range of flow rates, and are less prone to liquidcarry-over. Precautions are treated at length inpreviously cited literature.A1-2.14 A critical aspect of any scrubber design is theseparation of entrainment. Carry-over of spray from ascrubber can produce maintenance issues and mistemissions. Failure to provide adequate entrainmentseparation has been one of the most common problemsin scrubber installations. The predominant mistseparator employed is a mesh style. Mesh styleseparators are effective on the smaller water dropletsassociated with spray nozzles; however, maintenance

SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 2001 14 due to solids and/or biological growth is required. Thechevron style is typically used in conjunction with aweir, as they are not very effective on the smallerdroplet associated with spray nozzles; however they arevery immune to plugging from solids and/or biologicalgrowth. The entrainment separators are discussed inSections A1-1.3 and A1-1.5.A1-2.15 Chlorine, fluorine and possibly other solublegases can be entrained in scrubber wastewater, andreleased in facilities drains/vents. Materials such asfluorine are incompatible with many plastics and candamage drains/ vents resulting in leak, odors, andfacilities interruptions. A1-3 VOC Abatement Equipment Design andSelectionA1-3.1 Design Criteria for Adsorption SystemsA1-3.1.1 Adequate contact time must be achievedbetween adsorption media and VOC-laden exhauststream. The adsorption matrix must be sized so thatadequate residence time within the media is maintained.Also, the exhaust stream flow must be distributeduniformly over the adsorption matrix.A1-3.1.2 Pressure drop across the adsorption matrixshould be minimized to reduce energy consumption forair handling equipment.A1-3.1.3 Materials of construction must be resistant toany corrosive action by the VOC's or by-productsformed during adsorption or adsorbent matrixregeneration.A1-3.1.4 Hydrophobic zeolites and activated carbon infixed beds, fluid beds or rotating wheels are being usedfor adsorption.A1-3.1.5 Adsorption materials have a finite capacityfor VOC adsorption and must be regenerated when theircapacity is exhausted.A1-3.1.6 Monitoring of the exhaust stream as it exitsthe adsorption bed may be necessary to determine whenregeneration or replacement of the adsorption mediumis needed.A1-3.1.7 Pretreatment of the VOC-laden exhauststream for removal of entrained particles or liquids maybe required to prevent plugging of the adsorption unit.A1-3.1.8 Regeneration is accomplished by flushing theadsorption bed with a carrier, typically steam, hot air orhot nitrogen.A1-3.1.8.1 Desorbed VOC's must be recovered ordestroyed.A1-3.1.8.2 Current practices for VOC recoveryrequires condensation or distillation. A1-3.1.8.3 Current practices for VOC destruction isusually oxidation.A1-3.2 Design Criteria for Oxidation SystemsA1-3.2.1 Adequate residence time, mixing with air andtemperature, must be provided for high efficiencydestruction of the VOC's.A1-3.2.2 Pretreatment of the VOC-laden exhauststream for removal of entrained particles or liquids maybe required to prevent plugging of the oxidation unit.A1-3.2.3 Downstream abatement of the oxidation unitexhaust will be required if corrosive combustionproducts \[such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) fromchlorinated vapors\] or particles \[such as silicon dioxide(SiO 2) from hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)\] arepresent.A1-3.2.4 Concentrations of the incoming VOC'sshould be limited, especially when using a concentrator.Typical incoming VOC concentrations should notexceed 25% of LEL.A1-3.2.5 Energy costs for heating VOC-laden exhauststreams must be considered. Straight thermal oxidizersare costly to use with high-volume, low VOCconcentration exhaust streams. Therefore, aconcentration process followed by recuperative orregenerative oxidation offers a more cost-effectivesolution.A1-3.2.5.1 Catalytic oxidation may also offer costsavings; however, the composition of incomingcompounds must not poison the catalyst.A1-3.2.5.2 A regenerative thermal oxidizer (without apreceding concentrator) may offer cost savings incertain applications.A1-3.2.6 Hybrid systems (combinations of adsorptionand oxidation systems) may provide a cost-effectiveapproach for abating dilute concentrations of VOCs inexhaust streams by combining adsorption beds withrecuperative/regenerative oxidation, to destroy theVOCs.A1-3.2.6.1 All design considerations for adsorptionsystems and oxidation systems are relevent for any ofthe multitude of possible hybrid systems.A1-3.2.6.2 Levels of oxidation by-products must alsobe considered such as oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbonmonoxide (CO) and products of incomplete combustion(PICs).A1-3.2.7 Potential problem areas to be reviewed in anyequipment selection procedure:A1-3.2.7.1 Halogenated Materials  Additional caremust be exercised with chlorinated compounds, which

SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 2001 16 APPENDIX 2POU ABATEMENT TECHNOLOGY TYPES NOTE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI F5 and was approved by full letter ballotprocedures on August 27, 2001. A2-1 POU Abatement Technology Types:1. Wet scrubbing systems2. Oxidation systems3. Cold bed systems (adsorbers/ chemisorbers)4. Hot chemical bed systems5. Reactor systems (e.g., plasma, microwave)6. Traps/filters/cyclones/precipitators A2-2 Wet Scrubbing SystemsA2-2.1 Water ScrubberA2-2.1.1 Principle of Operation  Exhaust gas ispassed through an enclosed space into which water issprayed. The desired result is that gases will dissolve inor react with the water. A large contact area betweengas and water is required to maximize the dissolution orreaction. Numerous designs exist to achieve this. Thepacked-bed scrubber is filled with open structureobjects (e.g., hollow balls) that are fully wetted by thewater spray. The gas passes over this large wet surfacearea. If the water spray is in the opposite direction tothe gas path the design is counter current; if in thesame direction, it is co-current; and if at 90° it iscross flow. Other designs to maximize gas/watercontact use meshes, atomized sprays, or multi chambersystems that reverse the gas direction several times.A2-2.1.2 Capacity  Total gas flow is determined bythe size of the unit.A2-2.1.3 Efficiency  Efficiency is determined by thesolubility of the gas in water and retention time in theunit as well as the given mass transfer from gas toliquid phase. Acid gases are best removed; many otherprocess gases may not be removed. If gas does dissolvein water then effectiveness of unit will be determinedby design input gas flow and inlet compoundconcentrations.A2-2.1.4 Limitations  Water scrubbers are onlysuitable for water-soluble gases. Many process gases(e.g., silicon compounds) will produce insoluble solids(silica) on contact with water resulting in solids formingthat may block the water sprays, scrubber packing orgas inlet port. NOTE 1: Compatibility of scrubber drains with thecompounds being entrained in the liquid effluent should beconsidered.A2-2.2 Water Scrubber with Energy Input (e.g.,Venturi)A2-1.2.1 Principle of Operation  Same as waterscrubber but gas and water are forced to mix by theinput of energy. Most commonly this is done by aventuri through which the gas and water pass. Otherdesigns have used rapidly rotating blades in theenclosed scrubbing space. The active scrubbing areais often combined with a passive spray chamber orpacked bed.A2-2.2.2 Capacity  Energy enhanced waterscrubbers have the same capacity as water scrubbers.A2-2.2.3 Efficiency  Added energy improvesefficiency over water scrubbers due to forced mixing,which improves efficiency of particulate removal.A2-2.2.4 Limitations  The limitations are the sameas for water scrubbers.A2-2.3 Chemical Dosed ScrubberA2-2.3.1 Principle of Operation  Chemical DosedScrubbers operate the same as a water scrubber but achemical solution is added to the water. This increasesthe range of gases that can be removed, from those thatdissolve in water to those that will react with the chosenchemical solution. The chemical medium is selected toreact with the known input gases producing water-soluble salts. The two reaction systems mostcommonly employed are acid/base andreduction/oxidation (redox). Addition of solutions ofsodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide(KOH) or sulfuric acid are frequently used to enhanceeffectiveness, and where chemical oxidation is neededhypochlorites, periodates, or peroxides are introduced.A2-2.3.2 Capacity  Same as water scrubber.A2-2.3.3 Efficiency  Same as water scrubber butincreased efficiency by using chemical dosing. Thenumber of gases, which can be removed, will alsoincrease.A2-2.3.4 Limitations  Even though a wider range ofgases can be removed with this chemical dosing, it isapplicable only to those emissions that can be waterscrubbed. The potential for fouling by silica solids

&lt;!-- Page 23 --&gt;

SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 200117 remains. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) or (sodiumhydroxide (NaOH) solutions have to be increased toapproximately 5% to ensure dissolution of silicates.Chemical dosing adds another hazardous material andmay result in liquid wastes that require treatment.A2-2.4 Chemical Dosed Scrubber with Energy Input(e.g., Venturi)A2-2.4.1 Principle of Operation  Same as WaterScrubber with Energy Input (e.g., Venturi) above, withthe benefits of Chemical Dosed Scrubber. A2-3 Oxidation SystemsA2-3.1 Burn SystemsA2-3.1.1 Principle of Operation  Burn systems aredesigned for silane abatement by utilizing thepyrophoric properties of this gas. The process gascontaining silane is injected into a steel containerthrough which a stream of air is passing. The silaneauto-ignites and oxidizes to form silica powder, whichdeposits in the system or is carried into the exhaustduct.A2-3.1.2 Capacity  Governed by the build up ofpowders, small units may need cleaning out every fewmonths, larger units will provide a years capacity.A2-3.1.3 Efficiency  When burn systems are correctlyset up, nearly complete oxidation will occur, providingthat the input silane concentration is greater than 1.5%.A2-3.1.4 Limitations  Burn systems are suited onlyto silane (or other pyrophoric effluent) abatement. Notappropriate for mixed gas process. If silane is dilutedto less than 1.5% in nitrogen before input nomeasurable oxidation will occur and the silane will passdirectly to the exhaust.A2-3.2 Flame OxidationA2-3.2.1 Principle of Operation  Oxidation ofhydride gases by combustion. These systems use achamber containing a fuel gas flame through which theprocess gas is passed. The resulting oxides fromcombustion pass into the exhaust and may be abateddownstream.A2-3.2.2 Flow Capacity  To calculate flow capacity,combine the total discharge flows that constitute inputto the abatement device. Include pump dilution andpurge quantities. .A2-3.2.3 Efficiency  For simple burner designs,efficiency can vary widely as gas flow changes; specificunits have been designed to ensure good mixing offuel/air and gas; these can deliver efficiencies greaterthan 99.9%. A2-3.2.4 Limitations  Suited only to processes wherethe input gases can be safely combusted. Design mustensure by-products are minimized (e.g., chlorinatedcompounds like phosgene/dioxins and oxides ofnitrogen). Produces combustion byproducts of processgases, therefore, is often combined with a wet scrubberto remove by-products or other water-soluble gases.A2-3.3 Hot Chamber OxidationA2-3.3.1 Principle of Operation  Exhaust gas ispassed into an electrically heated chamber (typically800°C) where it is mixed with air. The heated mixtureoxidizes, more quickly than in a simple burn system,but without a flame from fuel oxidation to assist.A2-3.3.2 Flow Capacity  To calculate flow capacity,combine the total discharge flows that constitute inputto the abatement device. Include pump dilution andpurge quantities.A2-3.3.3 Efficiency  Hydride gases will be oxidizedand removed to below the OEL.A2-3.3.4 Limitations  On its own, hot chamberoxidation technology is suited only to hydrides or othergases that will readily oxidize at the temperature of thehot chamber. This method is often combined with awet scrubber to remove oxidized by-products or otherwater-soluble gases.A2-3.4 Non-Flame OxidationA2-3.4.1 Principle of Operation  Non-flame systemsuse an incandescent porous wall for combustionwithout a flame. Fuel and air are mixed and passedthrough the matrix of the porous wall, which operates ataround 900° C. When process exhaust gases are passedinto this zone, they are oxidized.A2-3.4.2 Flow Capacity  To calculate flow capacity,combine the total discharge flows that constitute inputto the abatement device. Include pump dilution andpurge quantities.A2-3.4.3 Efficiency  Hydride gases can be oxidizedby a method similar to other combustion techniques.High efficiency oxidation is needed to oxidize morestable fluorinated compounds.A2-3.4.4 Limitations  Non-flame oxidation producesoxidation by-products, and therefore must often becombined with a wet scrubber to remove particulatematter or water-soluble gases. A2-4 Cold Bed Systems (Adsorbers/Chemisorbers)A2-4.1 AdsorptionA2-4.1.1 Principle of Operation  Exhaust gas ispassed through a container (cylinder, canister, or drum)

&lt;!-- Page 24 --&gt;

SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 2001 18 filled with adsorbent granules. These are commonlybased on activated charcoal. Some gases arephysically adsorbed into the granules while the non-adsorbed gases pass through into the facility exhaust.A2-4.1.2 Flow Capacity and Removal Capacity Both capacities of these systems are a function of thecontainer size (mass of granules) and surface area.A2-4.1.3 Efficiency  For a single gas, efficiency canapproach 100% until the bed capacity is reached.However, since the gas is only held physically it can bedisplaced by another compound, causing the efficiencyto drop significantly.A2-4.1.4 Limitations  Adsorption traps hazardouscompounds and does not destroy them. Gases areadsorbed at different rates and the capacity of the bedfor different gases will also vary. A more stronglyadsorbed gas entering the bed after a less stronglyadsorbed compound can displace the first gas re-releasing the first gas to the exhaust. The waste materialmust be kept sealed in the container and evaluated forhazards. Exposure to air, water, or heat can cause gasesadsorbed in the material to be released.A2-4.2 ChemisorptionA2-4.2.1 Principle of Operation  Exhaust gas ispassed through a container of granules that consist ofeither: adsorbent granule coated with some reactivechemical; reactive porous medium e.g., soda lime; or a resin matrix coated with some reactive chemical.A2-4.2.1.1 Gases are adsorbed into the porous matrixand then chemically react either with the granulesthemselves or with the coating. These reactions aredesigned to convert the gas into a solid material(typically a salt) that remains attached to the granules.A2-4.2.1.2 Reactive chemicals are typically eitherbases (metal hydroxides) or oxidizers (e.g.,permanganates, or metal oxides).A2-4.2.2 Flow Capacity and Removal Capacity Both capacities of these systems are a function of thecontainer size (mass of granules) and surface area.A2-4.2.3 Efficiency  Acid/Base and Redox reactionsare most readily accomplished. Therefore, with acidicgases and hydride gases, efficiency can be high; withremoval below OEL. With other gases, e.g., PFCs andhalogenated carbon compounds, efficiency is oftenminimal or none.A2-4.2.4 Limitations  There may be adsorption aswell as chemisorption, so the spent material must be evaluated for hazards, since gases can desorb from it.This is especially true for chlorine (Cl2) when the beduses hydroxides. These will form OCl compounds thaton exposure to air or moisture will regenerate chlorine.A2-4.2.4.1 Materials used for chemisorption canthemselves be hazardous (e.g., heavy metals or caustic(KOH/NaOH)) therefore, unused canisters may beclassified as hazardous items.A2-4.3 Adsorption with Subsequent Air OxidationA2-4.3.1 Principle of Operation  These systems aredesigned and offered mainly for high flows of arsine(AsH 3) and phosphine (PH 3), used in the deposition ofIII-V materials (such as gallium arsenide (GaAs),indium phosphide (InP)). These gases are adsorbedinto a carbon bed, into which air is subsequently fed ata controlled rate to oxidize the adsorbed hydride intooxides that will remain in the granules.A2-4.3.2 Flow Capacity and Removal CapacityBoth capacities of these systems are a function of thecontainer (drum) size (mass of granules) and surfacearea.A2-4.3.3 Efficiency  Capable of removing hydridesto below OEL.A2-4.3.4 Limitations  Hydride is adsorbed into thecarbon bed, the oxidation of this is exothermic. Whenair is fed in to oxidize the hydride, it is possible to startcombustion of the carbon bed, unless the flow rate iswell controlled. A2-5 Hot Chemical Bed SystemsA2-5.1 Hot Bed ReactorsA2-5.1.1 Principle of Operation  Exhaust gases arepassed through a steel container (cartridge/drum) that isfilled with reactive material. The material ismaintained at an elevated temperature, typically 250 to550 degrees C. The gases chemically react with the fillmaterial and are converted into inorganic salts thatremain fused into the matrix of the fill material. Thereare versions with a single fill material that are specificto abatement of one gas, and versions with two or morezones of fill material that can abate a wide range of gascompounds.A2-5.1.2 Flow Capacity and Removal Capacity Both capacities of hot bed systems are a function of thecartridge size (mass of granules) and surface area.A2-5.1.3 Efficiency  Efficiency of these systems isgenerally high, with gases removed to below OELs.Stable PFC gases are not removed by all systems.

&lt;!-- Page 25 --&gt;

SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 200119 A2-5.1.4 Limitations  Fill material can also reactwith oxygen or moisture so hot bed systems are notalways suited to wet processes or where air is used.A2-5.2 Hot Catalytic BedA2-5.2.1 Principle of Operation  Gas is passed intoa steel cartridge, which is held at an elevatedtemperature, that contains granules of a catalyst. Thetarget-input gas is catalytically converted to other gases\[e.g., ammonia (NH 3) to nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen(H 2), and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) to nitrogen (N2) andoxygen (O 2)\].A2-5.2.2 Removal Capacity  In theory, if notpoisoned, a catalyst bed should last for a long time.Units available are claimed to be able to operate forone-year before bed change.A2-5.2.3 Efficiency  Efficiency of hot catalytic bedsystems is normally high, with removal of the target gasto below OEL levels.A2-5.2.4 Limitations  Hot catalytic bed units aredesigned to be gas specific. Catalysts can be sensitiveto other compounds; so for complex gas mixtures inprocess exhausts they may not be suitable on their own.A2-5.3 Hot Reactor Beds with Gas InputsA2-5.3.1 Principle of Operation  Exhaust gases arepassed into a hot bed as in hot bed reactors above, butconcurrently with the process gas another gas isintroduced (e.g., air or steam). The gases then reacttogether in the bed, either with each other or with thebed material. Hazardous gases are converted either tosolid salts that remain fused into the bed matrix, orother gases \[e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2)\] that pass oninto the exhaust.A2-5.3.2 Flow Capacity and Removal Capacity Both capacities of these systems are a function of thecontainer (cartridge) size (mass of granules) and surfacearea.A2-5.3.3 Efficiency  Process gases \[e.g., phosphine(PH 3), carbon monoxide (CO)\] are normally removed tobelow the OEL.A2-5.3.4 Limitations  These systems are suited onlyto processes where the end products will be eitherstable solids or inert gases. A2-6 Reactor Systems (Plasma, Microwave,etc.)A2-6.1 Principle of Operation  Gases are abated inthe vacuum line (before or after the vacuum pump) bypassing them through a reaction chamber, containingplasma, to enhance reaction of gases such as silane intoa solid material. For high efficiency PFC conversion, it is necessary to inhibit recombination by the addition ofa material (e.g., moisture, or a hydrogen/oxygenmixture). Two types of reactors exist - large plasmavolume/small surface area, in which a downstreamparticle trap is utilized; and small plasma volume/largesurface area, where solid films are deposited. Otherreactor systems (e.g., microwave systems) are alsobeing developed.A2-6.2 Flow Capacity and Removal Capacity Reactor systems are designed for the process systemeffluent and are sized to handle specific process flows.A2-6.3 Efficiency  With inputs of up to 300 sccm ofsilane, removal efficiencies of greater than 99% havebeen documented. At higher flows efficiency can bereduced. High removal efficiencies of PFCs have alsobeen demonstrated.A2-6.4 Limitations  Silane will form solids in theplasma. Gaseous by-products will pass into theexhaust. Solids transmission into the vacuum pumpwill be reduced, but additional abatement devices maybe required downstream if by-products need to beremoved. Formation of hydrogen (H2) as a by-productshould be considered to ensure that the H 2 outletconcentration is below the lower flammable limit. A2-7 Traps/Filters/Cyclones/PrecipitatorsA2-7.1 Principle of Operation  Designed to removethe particulate component in exhausts. Some processesproduce solid powders (e.g., silica) and other processesgenerate condensable vapors. These vapors, oncompression in the pump and cooling in the exhaust,condense into solid materials. Numerous designs existto collect these solids out of the gas stream. Theseinclude filters (paper/bag etc.), cooled condensationchambers, cyclones, and electrostatic precipitators.A2-7.2 Removal Capacity  Removal capacity isnormally measured as the mass of solid the unit cancollect before it partially blocks. As they are blocked,these systems generate a backpressure, which canprevent effective removal of material or create aprocess disturbance.A2-7.3 Efficiency Efficiency for these various unitsis difficult to measure. It is usually assessedpragmatically in terms of increased interval betweenexhaust clean out.A2-7.4 Limitations These various units must be usedwith care and only when not associated with hazardousgases. Often solid exhaust materials are mixed withhazardous gases. If these gases are present in thetrapped solids a dangerous situation can result. Wheregases and solids are mixed it is safer to keep materialvolatile and abate all by a POU abatement technology

The maximum permitted time-weighted average exposuresto be used are those published in 29 CFR 1910.1000.4.12 pressure decay method  The method ofdetection of leakage through pressure loss, over aperiod of time, within a vessel or piping system.4.13 primary containment  The f irst level ofcontainment (i.e., the inside portion of the containerthat comes into immediate contact on its inner surfacewith the material being contained).4.14 pyrophoric  Capable of spon taneous ignition inair at or below a temperature of 54.5°C (130°F).4.15 secondary containment  Lev el of containmentthat is external to and separate from primarycontainment. Secondary containment is a method ofsafeguarding used to prevent unauthorized releases oftoxic or hazardous gases into uncontrolled work areas.Secondary containment means those methods orfacilities in addition to the primary containment system.4.16 threshold limit value/time-weig hted average(TLV/TWA)  As defined by the American Conferenceof Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH).4.17 uncontrolled work area  An y area outside of asecondary containment system where people are likelyto be present.4.18 vacuum decay method  Leak age detectiondetermined by the loss of vacuum (increase inpressure), over a period of time within a vessel orpiping system. 5 Containment Function5.1 Secondary containment should , in case of release,segregate the hazardous production material (HPM)from the surrounding area.5.2 Secondary containment system s should includeprovisions to contain and detect substances which posehealth or property hazards and to direct such substancesinto areas or facilities that can safely treat, dispose of,or dilute them prior to release into the atmosphere. 6 Containment ApplicationSecondary containment may be used on any system ifdeemed appropriate by the authority responsible for thesystem. Secondary containment should be mandatoryfor all HPMs that are included in the followingcategories:6.1 Those substances with thresho ld limit values(TLV) below the lower detectable limit (LDL) of thedetection systems in use.6.2 Those substances that provide inadequate warningproperties.

&lt;!-- Page 29 --&gt;

SEMI F6-92 © SEMI 19923 6.3 Those substances that fall into the followingcategories:6.3.1 Any HPMs which have a mat erial hazard index(MHI) value equal to or greater than 500,000.6.3.2 Highly toxic gas.6.3.3 Pyrophorics.6.3.4 Substances with unknown, but potentially hightoxicities (e.g., organometallics).6.3.5 Materials with an NFPA 704 r eactivity rating of3 or 4.6.3.6 Any corrosives that are not con tained in inertprocess piping.6.4 Where piping containing HPM s is installed in amanner to conceal it from view.6.5 Where piping containing HPM s is installed inuncontrolled or unventilated areas such as drop ceilingsor behind walls.6.6 Where required by UBC H-6 o r other existingcodes.6.7 Where there is any reasonable possibility of a leakin the primary containment due to normal wear andtear, possible abuse, or corrosive attack to the piping onthe inside or exterior. 7 Containment MethodsThe method of containment may take many formsprovided that the method is sound in engineeringdesign. This design should be in conformance tonationally recognized codes and standards as well as tothe requirements of local safety jurisdictions. 8 Materials of Construction8.1 Chemical Compatibility  If t here is a possibilitythat the HPM, or its reaction products, is corrosive, toany extent, to the secondary containment, one shoulddevelop a procedure to verify the integrity of thecontainment system. This verification procedure needonly be performed in the event that the HPM, or itsreaction products, contacts the containment (see Section9).8.2 Fire Resistance  If walls are used as thesecondary containment system, they should beconstructed of materials resistant of fire. The fire ratingof the secondary containment should be as follows:8.2.1 Two hour rating for pyrophori cs;8.2.2 One hour rating for all others. 9 Design Requirements9.1 Design Pressure  The system should bedesigned to provide secondary containment with theability to withstand the pressure of the entire volume ofthe potential leaking source without leakage.9.1.1 Closed secondary containment systems shouldhave sufficient design pressure to withstand thepressure of the entire contents of the source of theHPM. The design safety factor must be consistent withANSI B31.3.9.1.2 Open secondary containment s ystems shouldhave sufficient design pressure to withstand the releaseat full tank pressure or the entire contents of the HPMreleased within a time of two minutes.9.1.3 Special consideration should b e given to thecontainment of pyrophorics. Some pyrophorics candevelop considerable explosive pressure. Theelimination of oxygen from the annulus of acontainment system should be considered in lieu ofexplosive pressure data.9.2 Resistance to External Forces  The method ofconstruction of secondary containment systems shouldbe sufficient to withstand:9.2.1 Normal physical abuse found i n the industrialworkplace.9.2.2 Seismic zone activity as shown in the UBC(Uniform Building Code) or other applicable codes.9.3 Leak Integrity  The system s hould be designedto provide secondary containment with sufficient leakintegrity to prevent exceeding the PEL of the HPM inuncontrolled work areas.9.3.1 Primary piping should be leak tested inaccordance with SEMI F1.9.3.2 Closed secondary containment systems shouldhave the same leak integrity as the primary containmentexcept the closed secondary containment systemsshould be leak tested with the annulus pressurized to 2times the maximum operating pressure with argoncontaining at least 10% helium. There should be nodrop in pressure for a period of 12 hours.9.3.3 Open secondary containment s ystems should beleak tested to the same criteria as closed secondarycontainment systems per 9.3.2 above. 10 Separation of HPMsA single secondary containment may be used to containmore than one HPM provided that those HPMs are notreactive with any other HPM in the commoncontainment. Documents that should be considered forproper separation of HPMs include:

Control ofHPMs may consist of dilution, absorption,incineration, scrubbing, venting, or those methodsdeemed safe and suitable to the governing authoritiesresponsible for the facility. The initiation of thesecondary containment alarm system should beautomated. This system should automatically institutethe management of the leaking HPM in the event of abreach of the primary system. 14 Periodic Testing - After In stallation14.1 Secondarily contained piping s ystems must beinspectable. The method of inspection must be able toreveal the current strength and leak integrity of theprimary and secondary containment systems. 14.2 The secondary containment m ust be periodicallyleak tested in accordance with the criteria set forth inSection 9.3 of the above. Structural testing of both theprocess piping and the secondary containment shouldbe conducted to the maximum pressure specified inSection 9.1 of the above.14.3 Any secondarily contained pip ing system failingthe periodic inspection should be repaired or replacedimmediately.
