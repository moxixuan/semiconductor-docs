R14-8 Philosophy and General ConceptR14-8.1 Introduction  An automated machinesystem mainly comprises components such as industrialcontroller, drives, I/O etc. The level of safetyperformance of equipment can differ depending on theparticular application of FECS. However, irrespectiveof the particular application, the FECS alwayscomprises a series of sensors, logic elements andactuators for safe shutdown or a motion into a safe andstable machine state.R14-8.1.1 The term FECS according to IEC 61508 Part2, is equivalent to the terms SIS (safety instrumentedsystem) or SRS (safety related system) in otherapplication areas. The examples in this RelatedInformation show some possible architectures of thelogic system. Sensors, final elements and software arediscussed in this Related Information. Applicationhandbooks from automation suppliers provide users with valuable information on how to use thesecomponents in order to achieve a fail-to-safe,equipment control system.R14-8.1.2 For traditional semiconductor equipment,non-safety-related and safety-related technology, areseparated. In many cases non-safety-related and safety-related technology are linked, so that signalsrepresenting diagnostics, enable, and feedback can beexchanged.R14-8.1.3 Main Characteristics of ArchitectureConcepts1. Fail-to-safe equipment control system withconventional hardwired safety technology.2. Fail-to-safe equipment control system withseparation between fail-to-safe and standardnetwork technology.3. Fail-to-safe equipment control systems withcombined network technology for transmissionof fail-to-safe and standard data on a singlemedium.4. Redundancy can be used in all concepts toincrease availability. Different redundancyconcepts are in use (see R14-Section 9).5. Visualization on the standard control part andon the fail-to-safe part can be realized withvarious interfaces on the standard part and onthe fail-to-safe part.R14-8.2 Design of Architecture and ComponentsR14-8.2.1 Possible Application Areas1. Semiconductor manufacturing industry2. Guarding of people, machines, environmentand industrial processes Emergency stop functions, Emergency off functions, Emergency shutdown functions, Light gates, Guard doors, Scanners, Motion control with safety functions, Motor control with safety functions, Process valves with safety functions, and Process monitoring using safety-related interlocks.R14-8.2.2 Safety-related Equipment Control System The design of FECS should be carried out inaccordance with IEC 61508 and applicable parts of theother referenced standards. The safety controller isused to control (open-loop) processes that can"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 4 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S2-0703aE \xa9 SEMI 1991, 200483 immediately achieve a safe condition. An FECSconsists of sensors, logic systems and final elements asshown in Section R14-11. Replacing an existingelectromechanical system with a safety controller doesnot provide a safe system. Sensors and final elementshave to be considered as well.R14-8.2.3 Safety Requirements  The FECS should besuitable for SIL1 to SIL3 safety integrity level incompliance with IEC 61508 or control categories 2 to 4in compliance with ISO 13849-1 (EN 954-1). Therequired safety performance requirements will bedetermined in the system safety risk assessment. Forapplication assessment, local authorities and notifiedbodies should request a safety handbook andcertification according to IEC 61508 or ISO 13849.The safety-related system and its components should bevalidated to ensure it fulfills the safety requirements(SIL, CAT) determined from the risk analysis.R14-8.2.4 Principle Of The Safety Functions  TheFECS executes safety functions to bring the equipmentinto a safe state or to maintain it in a safe conditionwhen a hazardous event occurs. The safety function for a production process can be realized using a user safetyfunction or a fault response function. The safe state canbe achieved by de-energizing the output modules.R14-8.2.5 Communications  Non-safety-related andsafety-related communications between an industrialcontroller and I/O modules should pass through astandard network system or a safety network system insequence or through a combined network system (seeFigures R14-2-R14-7). Bridges, routers and repeaterscan be used in either standard networks or in safetynetworks to adapt the network topology to theindividual layout of production process and equipment.R14-8.3 Basic Topologies  Sections 7.3.1 through7.3.3 describe examples of network-based architecturesthat are capable of achieving a FECS. The suppliersshould take into account performance, timing, ease ofuse, and other factors when selecting an architecturetype.NOTE 8: These examples are not represented to be all-inclusive."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 5 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S2-0703aE \xa9 SEMI 1991, 2004 84 R14-8.3.1 Use of Fail-to-safe Equipment Control Systems with Conventional Safety Technology  Equipmentmanufacturers can achieve functional safety by the use of hardwired circuits.

In order to increase the availability of the automation system and therefore avoidprocess downtime resulting from control system faults as well as faults and errors of components such as the powersupply, the industrial controller, the network connection, and the I/O modules need to be made redundant. Possiblearchitectures (see Figure R14-7) for achieving high availability include 2 oo 2, 2 oo 3, 2 oo 4, etc. (see R14-Section9). Using fail-to-safe and high availability systems, injury to people or environmental damage can be prevented andthe production process can be continued without interruption.

The use ofcomponents such as safety PLCs and safety networks, that are certified by third parties for use in systems, andinclude specific SILs and risk categories, simplifies the process of assessing the whole system.NOTE 9: Certified (or listed) components need to be certified for functional safety use in safety critical systems.

It was derived from editorial work by theFire Protection Task Force. This related information was approved for publication by Technical Ballot and formaladjudication as an Effective date line item on March 18, 2004. R15-1 IntroductionR15-1.1 Preventing discharges from occurringaccidentally and ensuring that systems are able to fulfilltheir intended function requires attention to detail fromthe specification of the system, through design,installation and commissioning and then through on-going maintenance.R15-1.2 The following information is intended to assiststakeholders involved in the process of designing,installing, and maintaining fire protection ofsemiconductor manufacturing equipment. Furtherinformation can be found in the appropriate fireprotection codes and standards applicable to the type offire protection system and in related documents.NOTE 1: The term fire suppression is limited toextinguishing fire, once it has begun. The term fireprotection incorporates fire suppression and other means ofmitigating the risk of fires, including fire detection andmaterials selection.R15-1.3 The use of contractors with previousexperience in the design and installation of fireprotection of cleanrooms and semiconductormanufacturing equipment is desirable.R15-1.4 Independent third party review of fireprotection designs and installations by a fire protectionengineer with relevant experience can also help toensure that systems are correctly designed and installed.NOTE 2: The material in this Related Information ispresented as additional guidance in designing, installing, andmaintaining fire protection systems in semiconductormanufacturing equipment. Although this information isbelieved to be useful in optimizing such systems, the materialin this Related Information does not comprise additionalcriteria for determining conformance to the provisions ofSEMI S2 or SEMI S14. R15-2 Design ReviewR15-2.1 Ensure that system proposed uses approved orlisted components and that they are used within theirlisting or approval, e.g., FM Approved wet bench firesuppression systems should be used for open-faced wetbench whereas an enclosed tool can use a systemcomprising of FM approved & compatible components.R15-2.2 Detection needs to be selected to suit theworking environment and the type of fire/smoke that is anticipated. For example, optical detectors need tohave been tested and approved/listed for use withspecific flammable liquids or gases. Flames and smokefrom burning materials have varying physicalcharacteristics which mean that some detection deviceswill not always react promptly.R15-2.3 The location of detection devices in relation tohazards needs to be carefully considered. A detectorthat is located too close to a heat source may activatewhen it sees normal process conditions rather than fireconditions.R15-2.4 Some optical detectors may also besusceptible to accidental activation if they are exposedto welding flashes. Care in detector selection can avoidthis, but implementing strict cutting and weldingworking practices and permissions can also play animportant part. R15-3 Installation ReviewR15-3.1 Once completed by the fire protectioninstaller, the fire protection installation should beinspected and reviewed by a competent andexperienced fire protection engineer. This review will:R15-3.1.1 Verify installation against previouslyworking drawings.R15-3.1.2 Ensure that specified equipment has beeninstalled as indicated on the working drawings and inline with equipment approvals and listings.R15-3.2 Distribution pipework networks should becomplete (including all connections), properlysupported using listed and approved equipment.Frequent failures of piped systems, including CO2systems, occur due to incorrectly connected pipes orwhere fittings have not been made or sufficientlytightened.R15-3.3 Supports for pipework should be able towithstand the expected forces that will be experiencedduring discharge of the suppression system. This isimportant to protect personnel and property frommoving pipes in high-pressure systems using agentssuch as carbon dioxide.R15-3.4 Detection systems should have componentsinstalled as per reviewed drawings, however it is notalways possible during desktop drawing review toidentify that detectors are correctly sited. As a result,"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 13 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S2-0703aE \xa9 SEMI 1991, 2004 92 the field review should concentrate on ensuring thatcomponents are located so that they can see the hazardwithout obstruction, including clear vision panels,which may prevent detector from seeing the flame.R15-3.5 Similarly, detectors need to be sited so thatthey will not experience normal process temperatures,radiation or be exposed to chemical, liquid or particlesthat could result in an accidental activation.R15-3.6 Where linear heat detection cable is used itshould be located where it will not be exposed to levelsof ambient or process related heat that could trigger analarm signal. In addition, the cable should be securelyattached to prevent it dislodging and coming intocontact with hot surfaces.R15-3.7 Nozzle locations in many suppression systemscan be critical to ensuring functionality, reliability andsafety. For example, CO 2 nozzles incorrectlypositioned can result in chemical splashing ordislodging product or quartzware. If nozzles areexposed to chemical action including corrosivechemicals, it is important that the materials are resistantto the chemicalR15-3.8 Where automatic sprinkler heads are used, thefusible link should be adequately protected fromchemical and mechanical attack. R15-4 Commissioning TestsR15-4.1 All installations should undergo a thoroughcommissioning and acceptance test conducted by theinstaller and witnessed by the owner or ownersrepresentative.R15-4.2 Functional Tests are essential, but notsufficient to ensure that system will operate as intended. The types of problems that can be picked up byfunctional testing are:R15-4.2.1 Inability of detection system to detect asintended,R15-4.2.2 Inability of control system to receive signalfrom individual detectors, andR15-4.2.3 Inability of alarm panel to initiate systemdischarge or send alarm signals to connected devicesand safety systems, e.g., local or remote alarm panels, sounders & warning devices, and interlocks to equipment shutdown and safetysystems, EMO.R15-4.3 Discharge Testing is the only way that we canensure that that a system will fulfill its intended function. The types of problems that can be picked upby discharge testing are:R15-4.3.1 Lack of extinguishing agentR15-4.3.2 Inability to transfer agent from supply tonozzles due to: Blockages arising from incorrect equipment, Incomplete piping, loose fittings & supports, and Installation, design problems (e.g., icing up of CO 2pipes or nozzles).R15-4.4 In many cases discharge testing within thecleanroom environment is not considered acceptable orpractical. Accordingly, alternatives such as type testingcan prove that the design will provide the necessaryprotection, but may need to be supplemented by a morerigorous commissioning test of the final systems. Typetesting would involve the installation and dischargetesting of a system on a tool during manufacture or on amock up of the tool. The aim would be to prove thatdistribution pipework and nozzles have been correctlydesigned and that the concentration of agents anddistribution patterns from nozzles is acceptable. Thiswould be supplemented by additional tests on eachinstallation, including pressure tests of pipework andpuff tests to verify pipework integrity. R15-5 Burn InR15-5.1 In order to avoid unnecessary discharges, aperiod of burn-in for the detection system is advisable.This involves the detection system operating, enablingdetection of fires and initiation of alarms, but thedetection is not interlocked to shut down the processequipment or initiate a discharge.R15-5.2 A period of days or weeks may be appropriatedepending on the effect of an accidental activation ofthe system in terms of interruption to processing,damage to product or contamination of theenvironment. R15-6 Maintenance & ServicingR15-6.1 Once systems are installed and commissionedit is important that the routine inspection andmaintenance procedures recommended bymanufacturers and those required by codes andstandards, are adequately implemented.R15-6.2 The inspection frequencies may need to bemodified if the ambient conditions can adversely affectthe protection systems.

It is theresponsibility of the users of these guidelines toestablish appropriate safety and health practices anddetermine the applicability of regulatory limitationsprior to use.NOTE: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 1 Purpose/ScopeThis safety guideline pertains to open top heatedchemical baths, or wet stations, used in themanufacturing of semiconductors. The purpose of thisguideline is to provide general safety information forthe construction, operation, and maintenance ofchemical baths heated by electric immersion, externallybonded or heat exchange type heating devices. Thisguideline is not intended to provided detailed designinformation for the individual components of theheating systems, but rather to supply the safety criteriafor the design of these systems. (See Figure 1.) 2 Introduction2.1 Failure to follow the manufact urers instructions asto the application or installation of heating systems usedfor chemical baths can result in accidents and fires inwhich such systems may be implicated.2.2 The human element plays a maj or role in how wellthe hardware is used. The user of heated chemical bathsystems needs to understand the available technology tominimize the risk involved.2.3 The issue of bath operation an d maintenance hasbeen included in this guideline to support the safe useand maintenance of heated baths over their normalservice life. 3 Heated Bath Methodology3.1 Electric Immersion Heaters  Electric immersionbath heaters are resistive element heaters. The elementitself is typically protected by an outer sheathing whichacts as a corrosion and electrical barrier. The element ismounted to the inside of the bath.3.2 External Tank Heaters  Exte rnal type heatersare normally bonded by a mastic to the outside of achemical bath. The most common types aremanufactured from a thin metal foil material that resultsin a very low profile configuration. 3.3 Heat Exchangers  The most common type ofheat exchanger employs a separate heating source thatmay be remote from the station. This heating source canbe electrically powered to generate steam or some otherheat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid is thendelivered by chemically compatible plumbing to thebath and recirculated to the heater. 4 Minimum Heated Bath Saf ety RequirementsTo ensure the safe operation and maintenance ofheating systems, the following features are required. overcurrent protection power interrupt manual reset automatic temperature controller liquid level sensor overtemperature protection proper grounding and ground fault protection compatible construction materialsNOTE: Interlocks should operate as outlined in SEMI S2.These features should be totally compatible with each other.4.1 Overcurrent Protection  A f used disconnectswitch or circuit breaker sized for the amperage of theheater.4.2 Power Interrupt  In the even t of anovertemperature, low liquid level, or ground faultcondition, power to the heater(s) is interrupted uponreceiving the respective signal. The interrupt should beseparate from any relay incorporated into the automatictemperature controller. The interrupt should be wired insuch a manner that any signal from the liquid levelsensor, overtemperature sensor, or ground faultcondition should shut off power to the heaters and placethe system in a fail safe condition.4.3 Manual Reset  This reset sh ould be incorporatedinto the power interrupt device so that when the systemshuts off power to the heating element, a manual resetis required to re-energize the system.4.4 Automatic Temperature Contr oller  Anautomatic temperature controller maintains the liquid ata set temperature by turning the heating element on andoff. The controller is activated by signals from a sensorthat is located at the bath. To preserve the integrity ofthis system, quarterly service/testing and calibration in"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 25 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S3-91 \xa9 SEMI 1991 2 accordance with the manufacturers recommendationsshould be performed.4.5 Liquid Level Sensor  This se nsor will act to shutdown the heating element if the liquid level falls belowa safe operating level. When employing either animmersion or externally mounted type heater, it isrecommended that this level be no less than fivecentimeters (two inches) above the heating elementshot zone as established by the manufacturer. Thisshould prevent the element from losing the heat sinkcreated by the liquid.4.5.1 The selection of a suitable sen sor should takeinto account:4.5.1.1 The physical properties of the liquids beingheated and the environmental conditions to which thesensor(s) will be subjected.4.5.1.2 The mode of failure, if the sen sor fails.4.5.2 To preserve the integrity of the se components,they should be tested on a quarterly basis and servicedfollowing the manufacturers recommendations.4.6 Overtemperature Protection4.6.1 Liquid Overtemperature  A dedicated liquidovertemperature sensor should typically be set to trip ata temperature below the autoignition temperature of thechemical being used in the bath, and in no case higherthan 10\xb0C (18\xb0F) above the normal operatingtemperature.4.6.1.1 This temperature setting shoul d compensatefor the initial over-shoot often encountered whenbringing the liquid from ambient to operatingtemperature.4.6.1.2 The sensor should be located i n the liquid at anelevation approximating the top of the heating elementshot zone and no more than seven centimeters (threeinches) away from the heater.4.6.2 Heating Element Overtempera ture  Whenusing an electrical immersion type heater, a sensorshould be used to shut down the heating element if thesurface temperature of the element exceeds a presetvalue. The sensor is typically placed between theresistance coil and the protective sheath covering.4.7 Proper Grounding & Ground Fault Protection The amount of insulation surrounding a heater elementdepends upon the type of heater. This insulation notonly provides protection from the corrosive propertiesof the solution, but also acts as an electrical barrier. Ifthe barrier breaks down, it is possible for the solution tobecome energized.4.7.1 The electric heater elements sh ould be equippedwith a ground, the construction of which should be approved by a nationally recognized testing laboratory(NRTL).4.7.2 A ground fault circuit interrup ter (GFCI) shouldbe used to preclude worker exposures to potentialelectrical shock.4.7.3 The station or equipment in wh ich the heatedbath will be used needs to be reviewed to ensure that allNational Electrical Code requirements have beenaddressed.4.8 Compatible Construction Mate rials  Allportions of the station that could come in contact withprocess chemicals should be constructed from materialscompatible with these chemicals. It is recommendedthat metal materials be used in the stations constructionwhen using combustible or flammable solutions. 5 Operation and Maintenanc e5.1 Before heated baths are put int o service, a detailedreview of the wet station operation and maintenanceshould be conducted for all employees operating orservicing the station. New employees should receive thesame information prior to work assignment.5.1.1 All safety features included wi th the stationsheating system should be user tested, and the frequencyof testing should be noted in the users periodicmaintenance procedures.NOTE: Recommended minimum frequency of testing isquarterly and after any station maintenance.5.1.2 Vendor-supplied information o n the bathoperation and limitations that may apply should bereviewed and appropriate employee training conducted.5.1.3 When the user plans to install the baths and toperform maintenance, the suppliers should provideguidance to ensure that all aspects of the system, suchas the controller and the heated bath safety systems, areintegrated properly.5.1.4 Review the process requireme nts to ensure thatoperating temperatures are within the range andcapability of the safety controls. For flammable andcombustible liquids, operating temperatures should bebelow the ignition temperature.5.1.5 Limit the interchanging of par ts that were notincluded in the original design unless so advised by thesupplier. Alternate parts can lead to failures resulting ina fire or physical injury. 6 Related Documents6.1 UFC 1988 edition.6.2 OSHA Safety & Health Standa rds (29 CFR 1910)."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 26 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S3-91 \xa9 SEMI 1991, 19963 6.3 Joseph Lotti, Electric Immers ion HeaterRedundant Control System, presented toSemiconductor Safety Association Annual Conference,May 1986.6.4 Factory Mutual Insurance Cor poration, Plasticsand Plastic-Lined Tanks with Electric ImmersionHeaters, 7-6.6.5 National Electrical Code, Art icles 500, 501,Hazardous Locations, latest edition.6.6 National Electrical Code, Art icles 250, 422, 427,and 516, Grounding, Appliances, Fixed ElectricalHeating for Pipe Lines and Vessels and SprayApplication, Dipping and Coating Processes.6.7 SEMI S2, Safety Guidelines fo r SemiconductorManufacturing Equipment."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 27 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S3-91 \xa9 SEMI 1991 4 Figure 1"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 28 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S3-91 \xa9 SEMI 1991, 19965 NOTICE: These guidelines do not purport to addressall of the safety issues associated with their use.

Current edition approved by the North AmericanRegional Standards Committee on April 11, 2003. Initially available at ",(0,o.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.semi.org"},"www.semi.org")," June 2003; to bepublished July 2003. Originally published in 1993. NOTICE: This document was completely rewritten in2003. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this safety guideline is to provide amethod to size and identify flow limiting devices thatlimit the rate of release of hazardous gases from the gascylinder valve during transportation, storage, and use. 2 Scope2.1 This safety guideline provides a method to identifyflow limiting devices by size, and to calculatemaximum and minimum flow rates so that the sizerequired can be determined. Specific SAFETYWARNINGS are contained in Section 3.2.2 This safety guideline pertains to flow limitingdevices for valves on cylinders containing hazardousgases. These devices are intended to limit the flow rateof uncontrolled releases of gases at or downstream ofthe valve outlet. This guideline does not pertain to gasreleases caused by failure of the cylinder, the valveconnection to the cylinder, actuation of the cylinderpressure relief device, or some failures of the valve.2.3 This safety guideline pertains to flow limitingdevices operating at critical flow rates that result fromcylinder pressures greater than 103 kPa (15 psig).Generally, flow limiting devices are not used forcylinders pressurized less than 103 kPa (15psig)because the size required to provide adequate flow forthe process is so large that flow reduction resultingfrom the flow limiting device would be minimal.NOTICE: This safety guideline does not purport toaddress all of the safety issues associated with its use.It is the responsibility of the user of this guideline toestablish appropriate safety and health practices, anddetermine the applicability of regulatory limitationsprior to use. 3 SAFETY WARNINGS3.1 Installation  Only the gas supplier or cylinderowner should install, remove, or otherwise service theflow limiting device. Special equipment andprocedures may be required to perform any installation or service operation safely. No other person shouldinstall, remove, replace, clean, adjust, or otherwise alterthe flow limiting device unless authorized by thecylinder owner.3.2 Verification  When a flow limiting device isrequired, the user should always verify that the size isidentified by tag, label or marking on the cylinder orcylinder valve exterior, and that the device sizeindicated matches the requirement. If a required flowlimiting device is missing, the cylinder should berejected prior to use.3.3 Purging  The addition of a flow limiting devicein the cylinder valve may restrict gas flow duringpurging. The user should assure that adequate purgingmethods are used to prevent plugging the flow limitingdevice. As a minimum, the operator should purge thevalve outlet after use with the same procedure used forpurging the valve outlet just after installation of thecylinder. This is important to prevent contamination inthe valve outlet and reduce the probability of creating ahazard at the cylinder suppliers plant.3.4 Blockage  Under certain conditions, somehydrides such as diborane can polymerize and causeobstruction or total blockage of flow limiting devices.Care should be taken with cylinders that seem to beempty, but may contain product. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardSEMI S2  Environmental, Health, and SafetyGuideline for Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment4.2 NFPA Document1 NFPA 704  Standard System for the Identification ofFire Hazards of MaterialsNOTICE: As listed or revised, all documents citedshall be the latest publications of adopted standards.Regional standards may be substituted provided theyare equivalent.

A flow ratetolerance of \xb1 20% is used in Table 1 to allow forvariations in the entrance geometry and passage size.Figure 1 illustrates the flow rate variation resultingfrom this tolerance for different equivalent orifice sizes.5.1.2 flow limiting device  a device installed in a gascylinder valve that will reduce maximum flow from thevalve under full flow conditions.5.1.3 flow rate  flow rates in this guideline are givenin standard liters per minute (slm) at the standardconditions of 0C (32F) and 101 kPa absolute (14.7psia). This corresponds to the standard conditions usedfor calibration of mass flow controllers used insemiconductor processing systems.5.1.4 hazardous gases  gases that have a degree ofhazard rating in health, flammability, or reactivity ofclass 3 or 4 in accordance with NFPA 704, orequivalent rating by a regional standard.5.1.5 mixing gas  an inert gas used to dilute anothergas. 6 Flow Limiting Device Criteria6.1 Where Used  Flow limiting devices should beinstalled or incorporated into cylinder valves that areused for gas cylinders containing the hazardous gaseslisted in Table 2. Table 2 lists hazardous gases forwhich devices are known to be feasible by reason oftesting and experience. SEMI encourages testing by itsmembers of hazardous gases not listed in Table 2 sothat new information can be added.6.2 Materials  The flow limiting device should bemade of materials that are compatible with the gas inthe cylinder.6.3 Installation  The flow limiting device should beinstalled by the gas supplier or cylinder owner. SeeSafety Warnings.6.4 Identification  The preferred method ofidentifying flow limiting devices is by equivalentorifice size as shown in Table 1. Other means ofidentification, requiring identification by the supplier asto the device installed, may be used if unambiguous.6.5 Service Life  Removable flow limiting devicesmay be reused, but should be tested by the gas supplier or cylinder owner before each use to assure that theflow rate is as listed in Table 1.6.6 Sizing  A flow limiting device that will not allownitrogen flows out of the valve outlet to exceed the flowrates listed for its equivalent orifice size in Table 1.The flow limiting device should be the smallest sizethat satisfies the process requirements. The user shouldmake the choice of flow rate based on safetyphilosophy contained in SEMI S2.NOTE 1: Flow rates determined by the calculations in thissafety guideline are based on critical flow where the cylinderpressure is equal or greater than 2 atmospheres and pressure atthe outlet of the flow limiting device is 1 atmosphere.Consult the flow limiting device supplier to determine theminimum size that will provide the required process flow ratewhen cylinder absolute pressure is less than 2 times outletabsolute pressure. 7 Flow Rate Calculations7.1 The flow rates in Table 1 are specified for criticalflow of nitrogen through the flow limiting device atseveral cylinder pressure levels. Densities are given inTable 2 for some hazardous gases. First determine thecritical flow of nitrogen through the flow limitingdevice from Table 1, or calculate using the methodspecified in Section 7.2. Then, using the methodspecified in Section 7.3, calculate the gas and pressure-corrected flow rates to determine the proper flowlimiting device size for the application. For gasmixtures, the density can be calculated using themethod specified in Section 7.4.7.2 Nitrogen Flow Rate Nitrogen flow ratecorrection for cylinder pressures not listed in Table 1follows:NOTE 2: This equation is only valid for ideal gases, andcritical flow that results for most gases when Pcyl/Patm \u2265 2.It is necessary to multiply the equation by a compressibilityfactor (Z) for better accuracy, however for nitrogen attemperatures between -54 to +60C (-65 to +140F) and atcylinder pressures less than 21,000 kPa gauge (3045 psig), theresult will be accurate within a few percent.

It is theresponsibility of the user of this guideline to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.NOTE: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 1 IntroductionThe equipment supplier should design an internalequipment exhaust system that is efficient whenconnected to potential users exhaust systems. Seldom,if ever, are users systems designed for a specific pieceof process equipment or set of process equipment. Mostusers exhaust systems are designed and installed toindustry-accepted exhaust principles. 2 PurposeThis document is intended to help the semiconductorequipment supplier design equipment exhaust systemsto a common set of performance criteria as well as toprovide assistance to both users and suppliers in theunderstanding of exhaust requirements for equipmentsystems. It is not intended to establish designspecifications. The supplier will still own, and beresponsible for, the information it specifies. Thisguideline has six concurrent performance-relatedobjectives.2.1 Ensure hazardous gases, fume s, and vapors arecontrolled (during normal operations of equipment andfacilities services) such that concentrations present inthe work room air should be less than 1.0% of theThreshold Limit Value (TLV), as established by theAmerican Conference of Governmental IndustrialHygienists (ACGIH) or Permissible Exposure Limit(PEL) as published by the appropriate regulatoryagency, whichever is lower.2.2 Ensure exhaust is provided wi thin specifications tosupport the proper operation of equipment.2.3 Optimize the users exhaust sy stem(s).2.4 Use the most cost effective me thods to interfacewith users exhaust systems.2.5 Provide a platform for commu nicating specialcase exhaust requirements.2.6 Establish guidelines for measu rement andcommunication of equipment exhaust requirements. 3 ScopeThis guideline applies to all semiconductor equipmentthat incorporates exhausted enclosures that are intendedto be connected to user facilities exhaust system(s).This document is written with the assumption that theusers exhaust distribution systems will be designedwith central fans, ducting, and, where applicable,abatement equipment. Where users use other types ofexhaust systems, equipment suppliers should acquireexhaust specifications from the users. Whetherequipment is connected to a central exhaust system orto one which serves only that piece of equipment, thisguideline should be applied. 4 Referenced Documents (s ee Appendix 2) 5 Terminology5.1 balancing  Adjustments mad e after theventilated equipment and the ventilation system areinstalled to assure that airflow to each piece ofventilated equipment is within design specifications.5.2 capture  To entrain undesira ble elements (gases,fumes, vapor, and particles) in the exhaust stream forremoval.5.3 dilute  To reduce the concen tration ofundesirable elements to acceptable levels. Dilution is afunction of flow volume.5.4 flow velocity (V)  The avera ge speed at whichthe effluent stream travels through the exhaust duct. Itis measured in meters per second (m/s) or feet perminute (fpm).5.5 flow volume (Q)  The volum etric flow rate ofthe effluent stream passing a given location in theexhaust system per unit of time. It is measured in cubicmeters per second (m3/s) or cubic feet per minute (cfm).5.6 initiate motion  To use an ex haust stream to startcontaminants (or machine parts) moving from a restposition.5.7 long radius elbow  An exha ust duct elbow thathas a center line radius 1.5 or more times the ductdiameter.5.8 set point tolerance  The rang e (+/-) of staticpressure within which an exhaust enclosure willperform efficiently and effectively.5.9 static pressure (SP)  The me asure of differentialpressure across the duct wall to the ambient pressure"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 42 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S6-93 \xa9 SEMI 1993 2 (inside the duct). The unit of measure is pascals (Pa,Newtons per square meter (N/m2)) or inches of water.5.10 traverse measurements  Mu ltiple air flowmeasurements taken at points of equal separation, in amatrix pattern, along the face plane of an exhaust ductor opening in an exhaust enclosure.5.11 vena contracta  A point in a duct where thediameter of the air stream is smaller than the diameterof the duct. 6 Attributes of Typical Sem iconductorFacilities Exhaust Systems6.1 A typical semiconductor facili tys exhaust systemhas three measurable working elements: (1) flowvelocity, (2) flow volume, and (3) pressure.6.1.1 Flow Volume is related to the Flow Velocity bythe equation Q = VA. In this equation, Q = volumetricflow rate, V = average velocity, and A = duct crosssectional area (m2 or ft 2).6.2 There are three duct pressure m easurementspossible: (1) static pressure, (2) velocity pressure, and(3) total pressure.6.2.1 In exhaust distribution systems with central fansand abatement equipment (typical of semiconductorfacilities), exhaust duct pressure (static) upstream of thefan is less than the ambient pressure outside of the duct.6.2.2 While Velocity Pressure (VP) and Total Pressure(TP) provide a more reliable measure of Flow thanStatic Pressure, VP and TP are normally not specifiedfor semiconductor facilities exhaust systems; therefore,they will not be discussed in these guidelines. If moreinformation is desired on VP or TP, it can be found inIndustrial Ventilation (Appendix 2, Reference 1). 7 Exhaust Usage Typical of SemiconductorOperationsSemiconductor equipment typically uses exhaust toperform one or more of the following tasks:7.1 Capture  Capture should oc cur as close to thesource as practical to prevent exposure of personnel orproducts to the undesirable elements.7.1.1 Capture is a function of Flow V elocity. Chapter3 of Industrial Ventilation, A Manual ofRecommended Practice, 20th Edition, (Appendix 2,Reference 1) outlines the design principles and requiredvelocity calculations for proper capture of processemissions.7.2 Moving is also a function of Fl ow Velocity. Theexhaust requirements specified by the equipmentsupplier should be adequate to maintain motion of undesirable elements once they are captured in theexhaust stream.7.3 Dilution is a function of Flow Volume. Dilutionmay also provide reactive elements to undesirableelements entrained in the exhaust stream (for example,air and silane).7.4 Holding  The movement of the exhaust stream isoften used to activate and hold safety control devices,such as vane switches or differential pressure gauges inthe active state. Such safety control devices should beused to sense adequate exhaust pressure or flow toensure safe operation of the process equipment.7.5 Initiation of Motion  The us e of exhaust tointiate motion in the semiconductor industry is a specialcase application and should be resolved at the time ofpurchase. Most semiconductor-related gases, vapors,fumes, and fine particles (less than 20 microns indiameter) move with the air in which they are mixed. 8 Key Elements of Exhaust Specifications8.1 SEMI S2 establishes specific r equirements forexhaust enclosures of equipment that use hazardousmaterials. Access to enclosures serving hazardousmaterials requires special design. If there is a potentialfor exposure of personnel to hazardous materials whenthe access hatch is open, an average face velocity(measured at the hatch opening) sufficient to capturethe hazardous materials should be maintained in thehatch opening. (SEMI S2 also has recommendations forexhaust monitoring and alarms. S2 should be fullyunderstood before designing exhaust systems forhazardous materials.)8.2 Properties of chemicals (densi ty, vapor pressure,boiling point, flammability, etc.), the state of thematerials within the exhausted enclosure (solid, liquid,or gas), and conditions such as temperature andconcentration will determine the final design andexhaust specifications of the equipment enclosure.Equipment suppliers should use available referencebooks and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) toobtain information on chemical properties. Theequipments process requirements will dictate the stateand condition of the material.8.3 When developing specification s for equipmentexhaust systems to be given to the equipment user,equipment suppliers should incorporate all of the keyelements that will provide clear and accurateinformation. These key elements are:1. Point of measurement.2. Duct size at the point of measurement.3. Flow through the duct."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 43 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S6-93 \xa9 SEMI 19933 4. Air density.5. Temperature of the exhaust stream when it entersthe exhaust system.6. Static pressure at the point of measurement.7. Physical condition of the process equipment at thetime of measurement.8. Peak, normal, and special exhaust requirements.9. Equipment environmental conditions anticipated(installed).10. Stability and tolerance requirements of thespecifications.11. Priority of exhaust attributes when the system isbalanced. (What is the primary intent of the exhaust,secondary, etc.?)12. Instruments and practices used (and recommended)for taking measurements.13. Design information on the complete equipmentexhaust system (including materials ofconstruction).14. Constituents of the exhaust stream. Each of these key elements is discussed in detail inSections 8.3.1 through 8.3.14.8.3.1 The point of measurement for the equipmentexhaust duct should be clearly defined. Informationgiven to locate the point of measurement should includea diagram of the exhaust connection with locations ofthe traverse points used.8.3.1.1 Turbulence in the duct at the p oint ofmeasurement should be minimized. The measurementpoint should be in a straight section of duct. It should bedownstream in the connecting duct past the venacontracta from the last transition made in theequipment. It should be far enough from fittings,dampers, or sprinkler heads to minimize theirinterference with the measurements. Normalrecommended practice is 7.5 duct diameters from anypoint of connection or fitting. See HVAC SystemsTesting, Adjusting, and Balancing, (Appendix 2,Reference 3).8.3.1.2 Equipment users typically use a throttlingdamper for exhaust balancing where the equipmentdrop connects to the rest of the exhaust system.Balancing measurements should be taken on theequipment side of these balancing dampers. Thesupplier may elect to provide a damper, at or near theequipment connection point, to be used only as a trimming device over a narrow performance bandaround the equipment flow and pressure specifications.Features of this damper should be designed to preventcomplete blockage of exhaust flow.8.3.2 Duct size is the inside diamete r of the exhaustconnection from the equipment. The supplier shouldprovide any other dimensions needed to design theconnection of the exhaust system to the equipment.8.3.2.1 The duct size of the equipmen t connectionshould fall in the low flow velocity range of the ductfriction table. See HVAC Systems Duct Design(Appendix 2, Reference 2). Low flow velocity ductswill promote flexibility and ease of interface to exhaustsystems serving multiple equipment. When particles areto be captured and removed, design the system for theminimum flow velocity that will ensure capture.NOTE: Exhaust system designers should always keep in mindthe difficulty that can be experienced in flow velocitymeasurements in unduly large ducts. Tool connections shouldbe sized for accurate flow measurements.8.3.2.2 The design of the equipment e xhaustconnection should allow for long radius connectingelbows at the point of connection. This will reducefriction losses. Additionally, the equipment suppliershould avoid configurations that would require an angleof entrance into the users branch ducts of greater than30 degrees.8.3.2.3 Duct connection configuration should be suchthat liquid spills or releases within the equipmentenclosures will not enter the facilitys exhaust system.8.3.3 Flow through the equipment e nclosure, and theduct at the point of connection, can be specified invelocity or volume. Normally, the balancing engineerwill measure Flow Velocity and convert velocity toFlow Volume using the equation Q = VA. (See Section6.1.1.)8.3.3.1 Section 8.3.6 of this document shows thepressure guidelines for semiconductor exhaust systems.The equipment supplier should establish, throughtesting, the Flow Velocity and Volume required forefficient operation of its equipments exhaust system.The user and the supplier should agree, before thepurchase of the equipment, on the safety controldevices to be used. Any safety control device requiringflows or pressures outside these ranges is a special caseand should be resolved at the time of purchase.8.3.4 Exhaust specifications should be stated inStandard Air Density (kg/m3 or lb/ft3), as defined inIndustrial Ventilation, (Appendix 2, Reference 1). Ifthe measurements are of non-standard air, state thecorrection factor for density. Users should correct fieldbalancing measurements taken above 600 meters (2000"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 44 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S6-93 \xa9 SEMI 1993 4 feet) elevation before comparing them to suppliersspecified data. Additionally, the supplier-specified datamust be corrected to sea level if it was measured above600 meters elevation.8.3.4.1 Flow measurements taken at o ther thanstandard air temperatures (21.1\xb0C (70\xb0F)) should becorrected to standard conditions.8.3.4.2 Corrections for altitude and temperature shoulduse the following relationship:M 3 /s = (m3 /s)(294.3/T K )(D)CFM = (cfm)(530/T R)(D)M 3 /s = Standard cubic meters per secondm3/s = Measured cubic meters per secondCFM = Standard cubic feet per minutecfm = Measured cubic feet per minuteT K = Measured temperature in degrees K (T K = T C +273.2)T C = Measured temperature in degrees CT R = Measured temperature in degrees R (T R = T F +459.7)T F = Measured temperature in degrees FD = Altitude density correction factor Altitude Density Correction Factorsea level 1.00300 m (1000 ft) 0.96600 m (2000 ft) 0.93900 m (3000 ft) 0.891200 m (4000 ft) 0.861500 m (5000 ft) 0.83 8.3.5 The expected temperature of th e exhaust stream(from the suppliers equipment) at the connection to theusers exhaust system should be included in thespecifications. The connecting duct material should becompatible with this temperature. The normal operatingand maximum high and minimum low temperaturesshould be specified.8.3.6 Static pressure is measured at the same traversepoint as discussed in Section 8.3.1. The equipmentspecifications should define the minimum StaticPressure, at the point of connection, required for properequipment operation.8.3.6.1 The target Static Pressure rang e at the point ofconnection to equipment is -125 to -250 Pa (-0.5 inchesto -1.0 inches of water). This permits flexibility of equipment placement with minimal need for pressureboosting devices, such as booster fans.8.3.6.2 For exhaust Static Pressure req uirements lowerthan -1.0 inches of water, the equipment supplier mustestablish, with the users concurrence, the specificationsfor a safe booster add-on device. A larger negativenumber is a lower exhaust pressure. Normally, userswill install boosters only when their exhaustdistribution system cannot reach the specified staticpressure. As each users facility is unique, booster add-on devices should be separate from the equipmentsfunctional design and used only as a last resort.8.3.7 The physical settings and conf iguration of theprocess equipment when specified flow and pressuremeasurements are made is critical to the repeatability ofthe measurements.8.3.7.1 Exhaust enclosures, capture zo nes, and entrypoints in the equipment should isolate the area to beexhausted from adjacent areas. Internal ducts,partitions, and guide plates in the equipment should beleak tight to prevent the release of contamination fromthe exhaust stream.8.3.7.2 To capture, move, or dilute co ntaminantseffectively within the equipments exhaust enclosure,there must be a continuous supply of make-up air. Theenclosure should be designed such that the make-up airis drawn from a selected area through designedopenings in the enclosure walls. Care should be taken toensure the make-up air does not contain, or potentiallycontain, vapors or fumes that could be incompatiblewith the exhaust enclosures material of construction,components, or target materials being exhausted.8.3.7.3 Minimize the volume of the en closures wherepossible to reduce the load on the exhaust system andon its companion make-up air system.8.3.7.4 Enclosures supplied with, or a s part of,equipment should be designed so that exhaust properlysweeps all potential emission release points.8.3.7.5 Aerodynamic dead spots ins ide the enclosureshould be minimized.8.3.7.6 Components that have no pote ntial for releaseshould be located outside the enclosure, when possible.Additionally, the handles for any valves located insidethe exhausted enclosure should be positioned outside ofthe enclosure to reduce the need to open the enclosure.8.3.7.7 Verification that the exhaust e nclosureprovides the desired capture of contaminants can beaccomplished by using Sulfur Hexafluoride as a tracergas (see SEMI F15). Verification that aerodynamicdead spots have been eliminated can be accomplished"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 45 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S6-93 \xa9 SEMI 19935 by use of clean smoke generated from a deionizedwater vapor generating system.8.3.7.8 Once capture has been verified , measurementsshould be taken at specific openings (make-up air slots,access ports, or windows, etc.) to establish theminimum flow velocity necessary at these specificopenings to achieve capture.8.3.7.9 Record the position of covers, doors, dampers,valved openings, etc., and flow restrictions (such asfluid levels in vessels which exhaust air serves or flowsthrough) at the time of the ventilation tests so that thetest can be duplicated.8.3.7.10 The supplier should specify ho w to duplicatethese conditions at the time of field adjustment andbalance. If the original conditions are not duplicated,the exhaust losses through the equipment may vary.The major risk is that the equipment exhaust level willbe set as close to the suppliers specifications aspossible and may not provide the safety level intendedduring actual equipment operation.8.3.8 The equipment may require di fferent exhaustflow or pressure during the process cycle than instandby or maintenance modes. The supplier shouldprovide specifications for normal operating modedemands, peak demand, and any other demand levelrequired for employee safety. The normal, peak, andother critical safety condition demands should becompensated for in both the system design and the fieldbalance.8.3.9 Equipment data used to establi sh exhaustspecifications should reflect the equipmentsenvironmental conditions anticipated when installed(e.g., bulkhead mounted equipment is supplied withdata for a bulkhead installation).8.3.9.1 Typical user clean rooms are d esigned usingthe bay and chase concept. The bay is served with100% ceiling-supplied, HEPA-filtered air. Vertical airflow below the ceiling is typically 0.5 m/s (100 FPM)across the entire bay. The chase section is the return airplenum for the bay air supply system. The typicalpressure differential across the bay wall is 2.5 to 7.5 Pa(0.01 to 0.03 inches of water), with the lower pressureon the chase side.8.3.9.2 Bulkhead or through-the-wall mountedequipment should tolerate this pressure differential.8.3.9.3 Cabinet or enclosure exhaust a pplicationsshould be designed so that back streaming into theclean bay or chase is prevented.8.3.10 The set point tolerance at time of initialinstallation should be included in the specification.Performance stability over time for the exhaust flow and pressure requirements, needed to supportequipment operations and safe working conditions,should also be specified.8.3.10.1 The users exhaust distribution systemstypically hold a balance setting \xb110% of the set point(s)over time. Equipment which integrates high or lowexhaust level alarms, requiring tighter stability control,are special cases and should be identified at the time ofpurchase.8.3.10.2 The supplier-specified set poin ts for ExhaustFlow, Volume, and Pressure should include a toleranceof -0% +10%. (This is the common acceptance rangeestablished for exhaust distribution system balance.)8.3.11 The five methods of exhaust u se discussed inSection 7 drive different priorities when establishingexhaust specifications.8.3.11.1 The initiate motion and hol d functionsare either pressure or velocity driven, depending on thesafety equipment selected by the supplier.8.3.11.2 Capturing and moving are typicallyvelocity-dependent.8.3.11.3 Dilution is flow volume dep endent.8.3.11.4 The equipment exhaust specifi cation shouldfocus on the exhaust attribute (see Section 6) associatedwith the exhaust use (see Section 7). If multiple usesare being met, the supplier should prioritize Pressure,Flow, and Flow Volume for balancing.8.3.12 The instruments and practices used for takingmeasurements to establish equipment specificationsshould be recommended in the specifications and usedin field balance operations.8.3.12.1 A hot wire anemometer is acce ptable forvelocities less than 150 m/s (500 FPM). A low rangedifferential pressure gauge (0 to 60 Pa or 0.0 to 0.25inches of water) is acceptable for velocities over 150m/s (500 FPM).8.3.12.2 An inclined/vertical manomete r or high rangedifferential pressure gauge is acceptable for measuringstatic pressure.8.3.12.3 Conversion charts should be d eveloped toindicate what flow volume is present at various pointson the inclined/vertical manometer or differentialpressure gauge.8.3.12.4 Equipment suppliers should in cluderecommendations in the equipment specifications forthe proper selection of the pitot tube, static tip, etc., touse when measuring exhaust flow and pressure.8.3.12.5 The description, operation, ma intenance, andlimitations of these and alternate instruments is covered"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 46 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S6-93 \xa9 SEMI 1993 6 8.3.12.6 in Chapter 9 of Industrial Ven tilation, AManual of Recommended Practice, 20th Edition,(Appendix 2, Reference 1).
