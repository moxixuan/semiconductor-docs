RELATED INFORMATION 1
METHOD FOR ESTIMATION OF SHALLOW ETCH PIT DENSITY
NOTICE: This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  MF1049.    It  was  developed  as  part  of  the
development  of  the  document.    This  related  information  was  approved  for  publication  by  full  letter  ballot  on
December 4, 2003.

R1-1 Procedure
R1-1.1    Examine  the  wafer  under  magnification  in  the
range from 200 to 1000× to distinguish between etching
artifacts and shallow etch pits.
R1-1.2 Place the wafer on the microscope stage.
R1-1.3  Position  the  specimen  so  as  to  view  the  area  of
interest on the etched wafer surface.  Choose the area to
be viewed to include a high density of haze.
R1-1.4  Adjust  the  magnification  so  that  up  to  100
shallow etch pits are seen in the field of view.  If more
than  100  shallow  etch  pits  are  in  the  field  of  view  at
maximum  magnification,  report  the  shallow  etch  pit
density as “Too high to count.”
R1-1.5  Calculate  the  area  of  the  field  of  view  from  its
diameter   as   determined   to   ±   1   μm   with   a   stage
micrometer.
R1-1.6  Count  and  record  the  number  of  shallow  etch
pits  in  the  field  of  view.    Count  as  one  defect,  those
defects  that  converge  or  overlap  except  when  the  etch
pits   are   well   defined   and   are   individually   distin-
guishable.
R1-1.7  Determine  the  estimate  of  the  shallow  etch-pit
density by dividing the number of etch pits counted by
the area of the field of view.
R1-1.8  If  more  than  one  area  is  counted,  compute  the
average   shallow   etch-pit   density   for   the   wafer   by
dividing   the   sum   of   the   shallow   etch-pit   densities
estimated by the total number of counting positions.
R1-2 Precision and Bias
R1-2.1 Precision —  Because  this  optional  method  is
intended  for  use  only  for  qualitative  estimates  of  the
area of a wafer covered by haze due to shallow etch pits
and  the  shallow  etch-pit  density,  no  interlaboratory
evaluation  of  this  optional  method  has  been  conducted
for    the    purposes    of    determining    its    expected
repeatability or reproducibility.
R1-2.2 Bias —  No  standards  exist  against  which  the
bias of this optional method can be evaluated.

SEMI MF1152-0305
TEST   METHODS   FOR   DIMENSIONS   OF   NOTCHES   ON   SILICON
WAFERS
These  test  methods  were  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  are  the  direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the   North   American   Regional   Standards   Committee   on   November   4,   2004.      Initially   available   at
www.semi.org
January   2005;   to   be   published   March   2005.      Original   edition   published   by   ASTM
International as ASTM F 1152-88.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1152-02.
1  Purpose
1. 1  Wafers must be accurately aligned in various processing equipment during integrated circuit manufacture.
1. 2  A  notch  ground  into  the  edge  of  the  wafer  at  a  specified  orientation  provides  a  positive  method  for  such
alignment.  The accuracy of the critical dimensions of the notch controls the possible accuracy of the alignment.
1. 3  This test method may be used for process control, quality control, and incoming or outgoing inspection.
1. 4  Until  an  index  of  precision  is  determined  based  on  an  interlaboratory  evaluation,  this  test  method  is  not
recommended for use in decisions between purchasers and suppliers.
2  Scope
2. 1  This test method covers a nondestructive procedure to determine whether or not the dimensions, except for the
blend radius, of fiducial notches on silicon wafers fall within specified limits.
2. 2  This  test  method  is  specifically  directed  to  the  notch  dimensions  specified  in  SEMI  M1,  but  with  suitable
modifications, the principles of this test method may be applied to any desired notch dimensions.
2. 3  No test is provided for the blend radius at the apex of the notch.
2. 4  The  values  stated  in  SI  units  are  to  be  regarded  as  the  standard.    The  values  given  in  parentheses  are  for
information only.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  guides  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  Any foreign material or rough spots on the notch edge in the light path may present a distorted image which can
result in the determination of incorrect dimensions.
3. 2  Alignment  of  the  notch  position  with  respect  to  the  center  of  the  wafer  is  important  in  achieving  an  accurate
determination of the notch characteristics.
3. 3  Wear  of  grinding  tools  and  process  variations  may  result  in  notch  edges  which  are  not  exactly  straight  and  a
nonunique radius at the apex of the notch.  Under these conditions, great care must be taken to align the image of the
notch correctly against the appropriate portions of the template.

5  Summary of Test Method
5. 1  The wafer is aligned in position on an optical comparator and the image of the notch is compared with a series
of templates projected on the screen of the comparator.
5. 2  First, the wafer is aligned so that the sides of the image of the notch contact the image of the alignment pin for
fixing  the  position  of  the  wafer  in  use.    In  this  case,  the  image  of  the  notch  bottom  must  lie  on  or  below  the
designated  line  on  the  notch  form/depth  template  and  the  image  of  the  wafer  edge  must  lie  on  or  above  another
designated line on the template.
5. 3  The  wafer  is  then  aligned  so  that  the  image  of  the  wafer  edge  coincides  with  the  wafer  periphery  line  on  the
template.    In  this  case,  the  image  of  the  notch  bottom  must  lie  between  maximum  and  minimum  lines  on  the
template.
5. 4  The image of the notch sides are compared with a series of angles on the notch angle template and the angle that
makes the best fit is chosen as the value of the notch angle.
6  Apparatus
6. 1  Optical Comparator — capable of 20× and 50× magnification with a viewing screen large enough to display an
area 5 by 5 mm at 20× or 2 by 2 mm at 50×.
6. 2  Fixture  —  for  holding  the  wafer  to  be  tested.    The  fixture  must  provide  means  for  positioning  the  wafer  such
that the plane of the surface of the wafer is perpendicular to the viewing direction and that the wafer can be rotated
about its center.  The horizontal and vertical motions are parallel or perpendicular to the diameter of the wafer that
passes through the notch.
6. 3  Templates — having lines which define the limits of the notch dimensions.  Two templates are required.
6. 3.1  The  notch  form  and  depth  template  has  two  sections  that  define  (1)  the  locations  of  the  notch  bottom  and
wafer  periphery  relative  to  the  center  of  the  alignment  pin,  and  (2)  the  location  of  the  notch  bottom  relative  to  the
wafer periphery.  Separate templates are required for each wafer diameter to be tested.  An example of a notch form
and depth template is given in Figure 1.
6. 3.2  The notch angle template contains angles from 88° to 96° in 1° increments.
6. 3.3  Instructions for constructing templates are given in §9.
6. 4  Gage  Block  or  Precision  Rod  —  with  dimensions  approximately  the  same  as  the  depth  of  the  notch  and
accurately known for use in establishing the magnification of the apparatus.
6. 5  Rule — 150 mm long with scale gradations of 0.5 mm or less.
7  Sampling
7. 1  Unless  otherwise  specified,  ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4  shall  be  used.    Inspection  levels  shall  be  agreed  upon  between
the supplier and purchaser.
8  Determination of Magnification Factor
8. 1  Adjust the comparator to the desired magnification.  Using the gage block or precision rod of accurately known
dimensions, follow the manufacturer's instructions to establish the object-to-image magnification to three significant
figures.
9  Preparation of Template
9. 1  Multiply each of the chosen or specified template dimensions by the magnification factor.
9. 2  Prepare on transparent material a full-scale template having the dimensions calculated in ¶9.1 with a projected
image accuracy of ±0.5 mm (± 0.020 in.).

10  Procedure
10. 1  Set the magnification to 20×.
10. 2  Align  the  fixture  in  the  comparator  so  that  the  notch  is  at  the  nine  o’clock  position  and  the  directions  of
horizontal and vertical motion of the fixture in the comparator  are  parallel  with  and  perpendicular  to,  respectively,
the diameter that passes through the notch.
10. 3  Place the notch form and depth template on the comparator screen.  Align the horizontal and vertical lines with
the simulated pin outline in the nine o'clock position.
10. 4  Place the first wafer to be tested in the fixture, front surface up.


SEMI MF1152-0305 © SEMI 2003, 2005 4
10. 5  Align the fixture using only table crossfeed (horizontal) control and fixture rotation so that the simulated pin
outline on the template makes contact with the sides of the notch image.
10. 6  Verify that the image of the notch bottom falls on or below the NOTCH BOTTOM LIMIT line.  If the image
of the notch bottom falls above this line, record the wafer as defective.
10. 7  Verify that the image of the wafer edge falls on or above the WAFER PERIPHERY LIMIT line.  If the image
of the wafer edge falls above this line, record the wafer as defective.
10. 8  Move the fixture to the right until the image of the wafer edge falls on the line marked WAFER PERIPHERY
using only the table crossfeed control.
10. 9  Verify that the notch bottom falls between the NOTCH MAX DEPTH and NOTCH MIN DEPTH lines.  If the
image of the notch bottom falls outside these lines, record the wafer as defective.
10. 10  Repeat ¶¶10.4 through 10.9 for all remaining wafers to be tested.
10. 11  Remove the notch form and depth template and replace it with the notch angle template.

10. 14    Align  the  image  of  the  wafer  notch  sides  with  each  angle  on  the  template  using  the  table  crossfeed  control
and  the  fixture  rotation.    Define  as  the  notch  angle,  the  angle  that  provides  the  best  fit  to  the  image.    If  the  notch
angle is < 89° or > 95°, record the wafer as defective.
10. 15  Repeat ¶10.14 for all remaining wafers to be tested.

SEMI MF1188-0305
TEST METHOD FOR INTERSTITIAL OXYGEN CONTENT OF SILICON
BY INFRARED ABSORPTION WITH SHORT BASELINE
These  test  methods  were  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  are  the  direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the North American Regional Standards Committee December 10, 2004  Initially available at www.semi.org

January 2005; to be published March 2005.  Original edition published by ASTM International as ASTM F
1188-88.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1188-02.
INTRODUCTION
Prior  to  2002,  ASTM  Test  Method  F  1188  used  a  long  baseline  for  the  1107  cm
−1
oxygen
absorption peak.  This long baseline was drawn between the average transmittances in the regions
from 900 to 1000 cm
−1
and from 1200 to 1300 cm
−1
.  The same baseline was used in ASTM Test
Method  F  121,  the  predecessor  to  Test  Method  F  1188,  and  also  in  the  analysis  of  infrared  data
from the Grand Round Robin (GRR) experiment.
1
The GRR experiment resulted in a calibration
factor between the infrared absorption coefficient at 1107 cm
−1
and the absolute interstitial oxygen
content known as “IOC-88.”  This calibration factor is utilized in the current editions of all known
standardized test methods for oxygen content of silicon, including DIN 50438, Part 1; and JEITA
EM-3504; as well as the current Chinese National Standard (GB).
The long baseline method is being retained in the form published in the 1993a edition of this test
method in Appendix 1.  However, the long baseline is subject to uncertainties due to perturbations
in  the  IR  absorption  at  the  end-point  regions  arising  from  effects  other  than  absorption  by
interstitial  oxygen.    Use  of  a  shorter  baseline,  drawn  between  1040  and  1160  cm
−1
, which is less
affected in this manner,
2
results in improved precision of the method.  Use of the shorter baseline
is  introduced  into  this  test  method  to  replace  the  long  baseline  method.    Although  the  use  of  this
baseline results in a somewhat smaller net absorption coefficient for the same oxygen content, this
change is not very large, and can be neglected in most cases.  Optionally, to completely eliminate
the  effect  of  the  baseline  changes,  the  measurement  equipment  may  be  calibrated  with  suitable
certified reference materials (CRMs) or reference materials derived from CRMs.
NIST  SRM
3
2551  oxygen-in-silicon  reference  material,
4,5
which  is  the  principal  CRM  used  for
calibrating commercial infrared spectrophometers for oxygen measurements, was certified using a
subset of the GRR specimens as the absolute references.  Both the GRR specimens and the SRM
specimens  were  measured  using  a  short  baseline  similar  to  that  now  incorporated  in  this  test
method.  This resulted in (1) reduced measurement uncertainty for the SRM specimens, and (2) a
strong  metrological  foundation  provided  by  the  GRR  specimens.    Consequently,  the  IOC-88
results are available to the users of the SRMs without requiring a change in the calibration factor
even though the short-baseline method is used.

Despite  the  fact  that  IOC-88  has  been  adopted  by  all  of  the  major  standards  developing
organizations active in the semiconductor field, many older calibration factors that have been used
in earlier standards issued by ASTM and other standards development organizations are still in use
in  the  industry  today.    Tables  showing  the  relations  between  the  IOC-88  interstitial  oxygen
calibration  factor  and  other  standardized  calibration  factors  that  have  been  used  in  the  silicon
semiconductor industry can be found in SEMI M44.  It should be emphasized that these factors are
at times referred to in the literature by common names and at other times by the designation of the
standard  where  they  were  used.    Furthermore,  in  the  jargon  of  the  industry,  interstitial  oxygen
content  is  frequently  described  as  being  determined  in  accordance  with  a  particular  standardized
method  whereas,  in  actual  fact,  only  the  calibration  factor  is  taken  from  the  standard  while  the
measurement itself is made by whatever method is employed within the instrumentation used.
1  Purpose
1. 1  The  presence  of  oxygen  can  be  beneficial  to  certain  manufacturing  operations  by  preventing  the  formation  of
process-induced defects.  Oxygen is introduced into silicon wafers during the crystal growing process.  Hence, it is
important to control the oxygen content of silicon crystals.
1. 2  Measurement  of  the  intensity  of  the  1107  cm
−1
oxygen-in-silicon  band  with  an  infrared  spectrophotometer
enables the determination of the value of the absorption coefficient and, hence, by the use of a calibration factor or
linear regression curve, the content of interstitial oxygen.
1. 3  This test method can be used as a referee method for determining the interstitial oxygen content of silicon slices.
Knowledge of the interstitial oxygen content of silicon wafers is necessary for materials acceptance and control of
fabrication processes, as well as for research and development.
2  Scope
2. 1  This  test  method  covers  the  determination  of  the  interstitial  oxygen  content  of  single  crystal  silicon  by
measurement of an infrared absorption band at room temperature.  This test method requires the use of an oxygen-
free  reference  specimen.    It  is  recommended  that  a  reference  material  set,  such  as  NIST  SRM
3
2551,
4
another
certified reference material set for oxygen content of silicon,
6
or reference materials traceable to the CRMs, be used
to calibrate the spectrophotometer in order to reduce bias.
2. 2  This test method requires the use of a computerized spectrophotometer, preferably a Fourier Transform Infrared
(FT-IR) spectrophotometer.  This method is incorporated into many modern FT-IR instruments.
2. 3  The  useful  range  of  oxygen  concentration  measurable  by  this  test  method  is  from  1  ×  10
16
atoms/cm
3
to  the
maximum amount of interstitial oxygen soluble in silicon.
2. 4  If the spectrophotometer is calibrated using 2 mm thick double-side polished CRMs, this test method is suitable
for  use  only  with  2  mm  thick,  double-side  polished  test  specimens.    It  can  be  extended  to  the  measurement  of  test
specimens  polished  on  one  or  both  sides  with  thickness  in  the  range  0.4  mm  to  4  mm  with  the  use  of  working
reference materials traceable to the double-side polished CRMs.
2. 5  The oxygen concentration obtained using this test method assumes a linear relationship between the interstitial
oxygen  concentration  and  the  absorption  coefficient  of  the  1107  cm
−1
band  associated  with  interstitial  oxygen  in
silicon.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.      It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  guides  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.


6  In addition to NIST SRM 2551 (Office of Standard Reference Materials, National Institute of Standards and Technology, 100 Bureau Drive,
Gaithersburg, MD 20899-2322), certified reference materials for measurements of the interstitial oxygen content of silicon can be obtained from
JEITA (see footnote 12) and from BCR (CRM 368 and CRM 369, from the Community Bureau of Reference, Commission of the European
Communities, rue de la Loi 200, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium).

3  Limitations
3. 1  The  oxygen  absorption  band  overlaps  a  silicon  lattice  band.    The  oxygen-free  reference  specimen  must  be
matched  within  ±0.5%  to  the  thickness  of  the  test  specimen  in  order  to  properly  remove  the  effects  of  the  silicon
lattice absorption.
3. 2  Since  both  the  oxygen  band  and  the  lattice  band  can  change  with  the  specimen  temperature,  the  temperature
inside the spectrophotometer sample compartment must be maintained at 27 ± 5°C during the measurement.
3. 3  Significant free carrier absorption occurs in n-type silicon with resistivity below 1 Ω·cm, and in p-type silicon
with resistivity below 3.0 Ω·cm.  For test specimens below these resistivities, the reference crystal must be matched
in resistivity as well as in thickness.  The resistivity match must be sufficiently close so that the transmittance of the
test specimen relative to the reference specimen at 1600 cm
−1
must be 100 ± 5 %.
3. 4  The  free  carrier  absorption  in  n-type  crystals  with  resistivities  less  than  0.1  Ω·cm,  or  in  p-type  crystals  with
resistivities  less  than  0.5  Ω·cm  reduces  the  available  energy  below  that  required  for  the  satisfactory  operation  of
most spectrophotometers.

5. 2.1  certified  reference  material  (CRM), n  —  a  reference  material,  one  or  more  of  whose  property  values  are
certified by a technically valid procedure, accompanied by or traceable to a certificate or other documentation issued
by a certifying body.
5. 2.2  dispersive infrared (DIR) spectrophotometer, n — a type of infrared spectrometer that uses at least one prism
or  grating  as  the  dispersing  element,  in  which  the  data  are  obtained  as  an  amplitude-wavenumber  (or  wavelength)
spectrum.
5. 2.2.1  Discussion  —  Some  dispersive  infrared  spectrometers  are  used  in  conjunction  with  a  computer,  which  is
used to store data.  The data are then accessible for manipulation or computation, as required.  These spectrometers
are  referred  to  as  computer-assisted  dispersive  infrared  spectrophotometers  (CA-DIR).    Dispersive  infrared
spectrometers  that  are  not  computer-assisted  are  referred  to,  for  convenience,  as  simple  dispersive  infrared
spectrometers (S-DIR).
5. 2.3  Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer, n — a type of infrared spectrometer in which the data
are obtained as an interferogram.
5. 2.3.1  Discussion — An interferogram is a record of the modulated component of the interference signal measured
by the detector as a function of retardation in the interferometer.  This interferogram is then subjected to a Fourier
transformation to obtain an amplitude-wavenumber (or wavelength) spectrum.  Due to the complexity of the Fourier
transformation, FT-IR instruments are always used in conjunction with a computer.
5. 2.4  reference spectrum, n — the spectrum of the reference specimen.
5. 2.4.1  Discussion — In true double-beam spectrometers, the reference spectrum may be obtained directly, with the
reference  specimen  in  the  sample  beam,  and  the  reference  beam  empty.    In  single-beam  spectrometers,  it  can  be
calculated  from  the  ratio  of  a  spectrum  obtained  with  the  reference  specimen  in  the  IR  beam,  to  a  background
spectrum.
5. 2.5  sample spectrum, n — the spectrum of the test specimen.
5. 2.5.1  Discussion  —  In  true  double-beam  spectrometers,  the  sample  spectrum  may  be  obtained  directly,  with  the
sample  specimen  in  the  sample  beam,  and  the  reference  beam  empty.    In  single-beam  spectrometers,  it  can  be
calculated from the ratio of a spectrum obtained with the test specimen in the IR beam, to a background spectrum.
6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1  The relative infrared transmittance spectrum of an oxygen-containing silicon slice is obtained using a reference
method  with  a  calibrated  IR  spectrophotometer,  preferably  one  calibrated  by  means  of  a  suitable  set  of  reference
materials.    The  oxygen-free  reference  specimen  is  matched  closely  in  thickness  to  the  test  specimen,  so  as  to
eliminate the effects of absorption due to silicon lattice vibrations.
6. 2  After  conducting  selected  instrumental  checks,  the  infrared  transmittance  spectrum  is  measured  over  the
wavenumber range from 900 cm
−1
to 1300 cm
−1
.
6. 3  The  measured  absorption  coefficient  of  the  1107  cm
−1
oxygen-in-silicon  band  is  then  used  to  determine  the
interstitial oxygen content of the silicon slice.
7  Apparatus
7. 1  Infrared  Spectrophotometer  ,  either  a  DIR  (S  or  CA),  or  FT-IR  instrument,  as  described  in  ¶5.2.2  and  ¶5.2.3,
respectively, may be used.  It must be possible to set the resolution of the spectrophotometer to 4 cm
−1
, or better, for
FT-IR  spectrophotometers,  and  to  5  cm
−1
,  or  better,  for  DIR  spectrophotometers.    Use  of  an  FT-IR  spectropho-
tometer is strongly recommended.
7. 2  The three following paragraphs apply only to FT-IR spectrophotometers:
7. 2.1  Zero  Filling  —  When  an  FT-IR  instrument  collects  an  unsymmetrical  interferogram,  an  additional  set  of
points whose values are all zero shall be added to the end of the collected interferogram such that the total number of
points for performing the Fourier transform is double the number of data points originally collected.
7. 2.2  Undersampling  —  The  data  collection  method  shall  produce  interferograms  which,  when  zero-filled  and
Fourier transformed, produce a spectrum containing at least two data points per resolution increment.  For example,


SEMI MF1188-0305 © SEMI 2003, 2005 5
after  transformation,  a  spectrum  obtained  at  4  cm
−1
resolution  shall  contain  at  least  one  data  point  every  two
wavenumbers.
7. 2.3  Phase  Correction  —  The  phase  correction  routine  used  during  Fourier  transformation  shall  use  at  least  200
points on both sides of the point of zero retardation in order to produce a phase array that can be used to eliminate
phase errors.
12

7. 3  Specimen  Holders  of  Appropriate  Size  —  If  the  specimen  being  measured  is  small,  it  must  be  mounted  in  a
holder  that  has  an  opening  small  enough  to  prevent  any  of  the  infrared  beam  from  bypassing  the  specimen.    The
specimens shall be held normal, or nearly normal, to the axis of the incident infrared beam (see ¶8.3).
7. 4  Equipment  and  Materials,  for  slicing  and  polishing  crystals  to  a  thickness  similarity  of  0.5%  or  less  and  a
surface  flatness  of  2.25  μm  or  better  (one  fourth  the  wavelength  at  the  maximum  absorption  of  the  interstitial
oxygen impurity band).
7. 5  Acid  Fume  Hood  and  Suitable  Protective  Gear,  for  use  when  stripping  oxide  films  from  specimens  for
measurement.
7. 6  Micrometer  Caliper,  or  other  instrument  suitable  for  the  measurement  of  the  thickness  of  the  specimens  to  a
tolerance of ±0.2%.
7. 7  Thermocouple-Millivolt Potentiometer, or other system suitable for measurements of the specimen temperature
during test.
7. 8  Hydrofluoric Acid, 4.9% (10:1 v/v), in accordance with Grade 2 of SEMI C29.
NOTE 1:  Warning  —  The  acids  used  in  this  test  method  are  hazardous.    All  precautions  normally  used  with  these  chemicals
should be strictly observed.  Obtain and read the Material Safety Data Sheet prior to the use of any chemical.
8  Testing of the Apparatus
8. 1  Evaluate  the  performance  of  S-DIR  spectrometers  according  to  Instrument  Operation  and  Nature  of  Test
Sections of ASTM Practice E 932.  Follow the appropriate paragraphs of these sections to evaluate the performance
of CA-DIR instruments.
8. 2  Verify  a  proper  purge  condition  for  the  specimen  chamber  by  monitoring  water  vapor  or  carbon  dioxide
absorption  bands.    The  water  vapor  line  is  monitored  at  1521  cm
−1
and  the  carbon  dioxide  line  at  667  cm
−1
.    The
instrument shall be sufficiently well purged or evacuated that the transmittance at these locations is between 98 and
102%.
8. 3  Under  certain  conditions,  the  spectrophotometer  may  have  a  nonlinear  response,  or  be  plagued  by  undesirable
extraneous  reflections  between  the  specimen  surfaces  and  the  spectrometer  components.    Place  a  flat,  double-side
polished and high resistivity (greater than 5 Ω·cm) silicon slice in the instrument.  The effective transmittance of the
silicon  slice,  due  to  reflective  losses  at  the  silicon  surfaces,  should  be  53.8%  ±  2%  in  the  1600  cm
−1
to  2000  cm
−1

region.  In some instruments, this silicon slice may have to be placed at a small angle to the axis of the incoming IR
beam, in order to minimize undesirable reflections between the silicon surfaces, and the spectrometer components.
This angle may be determined by initially placing the silicon slice normal to the axis of the incoming beam and then
gradually  tilting  the  sample  while  repeatedly  obtaining  the  transmittance  spectrum  of  the  slice  above  1600  cm
−1
.
The optimum angle is reached when a flat baseline as close as possible to 53.8% ± 2% is obtained from 1600 cm
−1
to
4000 cm
−1
.  This optimum angle is typically less than 10°.
9  Calibration Specimens
9. 1  Obtain  a  set  of  certified  reference  materials  (CRMs)  for  interstitial  oxygen  in  silicon  with  the  following
characteristics:
9. 1.1  Each specimen in the set is double-side polished and approximately 2 mm thick,
9. 1.2  The set covers the oxygen range of interest with three or more samples,


12  For a discussion of the phase correction computation, see Chase, D.  B., Applied Spectroscopy 36, 240 (1982).


SEMI MF1188 © SEMI 2003, 2005 6
9. 1.3  The stated oxygen content is referenced to the IOC-88 calibration factor,
1
and
9. 1.4  The set includes an additional oxygen-free reference specimen.
9. 2  To  extend  the  test  method  to  measurement  of  test  specimens  with  thickness  other  than  2  mm  or  with  only  a
single  polished  surface,  suitable  sets  of  reference  materials  must  be  used  to  calibrate  the  instrument  for  use  with
specimens of similar thickness and surface conditions.
9. 2.1  Sufficient sets of reference materials must be utilized to provide traceability from the reference materials with
thickness and surface conditions of the specimens to be tested to the set of CRMs.
NOTE 2:  A  practice  for  calibrating  infrared  spectrophotometers  for  measuring  oxygen  in  silicon  using  reference  materials  of
various  thickness  and  surface  condition  is  under  development.    In  the  interim,  some,  but  not  complete,  guidance  for  this
calibration can be found in the NIST SRM 2551 Report.
5

10  Test Specimen
10. 1  Choose  test  specimens  that  are  as  homogeneous  as  possible,  so  that  the  oxygen  content  measured  is  a  fair
representation  of  the  oxygen  content  of  the  entire  specimen.    This  is  particularly  important  for  dispersive
spectrophotometers, since in many such instruments the illuminated area of the specimen varies during the scan.  For
specimens  with  a  large  lateral  inhomogeneity,  this  area  variation  may  result  in  the  appearance  of  undesirable
instrumental artifacts in the spectra.
10. 1.1  Prepare a slice of the crystal to be tested so as to obtain two optically flat surfaces parallel to 5 min of arc or
less, as measured with a micrometer caliper or other suitable instrument.  The surfaces of the specimen must be as
free as possible of surface films.
NOTE 3:  When  the  specimen  faces  are  parallel  and  well-polished,  and  the  data  are  being  obtained  at  a  sufficiently  high
resolution, interference may occur between light rays reflecting from the front and back surfaces of the specimen.  The contrast of
the  interference  fringes  depends  upon  the  parallelism  of  the  specimen  surfaces,  and  the  fringe  spacing  depends  on  the  optical
thickness of the specimen.  These fringes can obscure a weak spectral line and prevent accurate measurement of the baseline.  To
prevent  obscuration  by  these  interference  fringes,  nonparallel  specimen  surfaces  may  be  a  necessity.    However,  the  use  of
specimens  with  nonparallel  surfaces  can  also  result  in  photometric  errors.    Because  silicon  has  a  high  refractive  index,  any
nonparallelism of the specimen can displace the spectrometer beam relative to the active area of the detector.  Thus, an apparent
lowering  of  the  transmission  occurs.    Improper  positioning  or  nonparallelism  of  the  specimen  can  be  checked  by  rotating  the
specimen to determine whether the transmission level stays constant.  Any variation is a possible indication of problems with the
specimen positioning or preparation.
11  Reference Specimens
11. 1  Because a difference technique is used in this test method, prepare an oxygen-free reference specimen of the
same type of material as the sample.
11. 1.1  Choose the oxygen-free reference specimen from slices taken from five to ten different silicon crystals that
are thought to be free of oxygen.  Compare these slices with one another, and choose the specimen with the lowest
absorption  as  the  oxygen-free  reference  specimen.    If  no  absorption  is  seen  for  any  of  the  specimens,  then  the
assumption  can  be  made  that  all  specimens  contain  less  than  the  limit  of  detection  of  oxygen  and  any  of  the
specimens can be used as the oxygen-free reference specimen.
11. 1.2  Prepare the oxygen-free reference specimen to the same tolerances as the test specimen with a thickness of
equal to that of the test specimen to within ±0.5%.
11. 2  Prepare separate oxygen-free reference specimens for each type of material to be tested.
12  Procedure
12. 1  Calibration of Spectrophotometer
12. 1.1  Obtain a set of certified reference materials for oxygen in silicon (see §9) and, if necessary, suitable sets of
traceable reference materials with different thickness or surface condition, or both.
12. 1.2  Use  these  reference  materials  to  calibrate  the  spectrophotometer  in  accordance  with  manufacturer’s
instructions.  The calibration results in a linear regression curve that relates the measured  absorption  coefficient  to
the interstitial oxygen content of the measured specimen (Note 1).


SEMI MF1188-0305 © SEMI 2003, 2005 7
12. 2  Instrumental Checks (FT-IR Spectrophotometers)
NOTE 4:  If a DIR spectrophotometer is being used, substitute the procedure in ¶A1-2.1.2 for the procedure in ¶12.2.2.
12. 2.1  Establish   the   100%   baseline   to   measure   the   noise   level:   On   double   beam   instruments,   record   the
transmittance  spectrum  with  both  the  sample  and  reference  beams  empty.    On  single-beam  instruments,  obtain  the
transmittance spectrum as the ratio of two spectra taken with the sample beam empty.  Plot the 100% baseline over a
wavenumber  range  covering  900  cm
−1
to  1300  cm
−1
.    If  the  baseline  is  not  100%  ±  0.5%  over  the  entire  range,
increase the measurement time until it does.  If the problem persists, have the instrument repaired.
12. 2.2  Record the throughput characteristics of the spectrophotometer by plotting a single-beam spectrum, obtained
with  the  sample  beam  empty,  over  the  wavenumber  range  from  450  cm
−1
to  4000  cm
−1
.    Use  such  a  spectrum,
recorded after the instrument has been properly aligned according to factory specifications as a reference to evaluate
the  instrument’s  performance.    Whenever  the  spectrum  obtained  deviates  significantly  from  the  instrument's
reference spectrum, realign the instrument (Note 3).
12. 2.3  Determine  mid-scale  linearity  of  the  instrument  by  obtaining  an  air  reference  spectrum  of  the  silicon
reference specimen over the wavenumber range from 1600 cm
−1
to 2000 cm
−1
.  If the value of the transmittance is
not 53.8% ± 2% over this wavenumber range, align the sample with the spectrometer in accordance with ¶8.3.
12. 3  Immediately  prior  to  the  initial  measurement  in  any  laboratory,  etch  all  specimens,  including  the  reference
specimen, in dilute hydrofluoric acid to remove any surface oxide, and rinse.
12. 4  Measure the thicknesses of the test and reference specimens to within ±0.2%, at their centers.  If thickness of
the  reference  specimen  does  not  match  the  thickness  of  the  test  specimen  to  within  ±0.5%,  obtain  a  reference
specimen with the proper thickness.
12. 5  Measure and record the temperature of the spectrophotometer chamber.
12. 6  Determine the measurement time for the spectra by obtaining the transmittance spectrum of a high resistivity
(greater than 5 Ω·cm), 0.04 cm to 0.085 cm thick double-side polished silicon slice containing between 12 ppma and
18 ppma oxygen (IOC-88) using a minimum of 64 scans.  If the ratio of the net amplitude of the oxygen band, T
b
−
T
p
, to the standard deviation in the transmittance spectrum is not greater than 100, increase the number of scans until
that criterion is met.
12. 7  Obtain  the  infrared  transmittance  spectrum  with  a  resolution  of  4  cm
−1
,  or  better,  at  1107  cm
−1
,  for  FT-IR
instruments or, for dispersive instruments, 5 cm
−1
, or better, over (at least) the range from 900 cm
−1
to  1300  cm
−1
.
The  test  and  reference  specimens  must  be  positioned  so  that  the  IR  beam  is  centered  on  them.    On  double  beam
instruments, obtain the transmittance spectrum with the oxygen-free reference specimen in the reference beam, and
the test specimen in the sample beam.  On single beam instruments, compute the transmittance spectrum as the ratio
of the emission spectrum of the test specimen to the emission spectrum of the reference specimen.
12. 8  Plot the transmittance spectrum over the range from 900 cm
−1
to 1300 cm
−1
.
12. 9  Define  the  baseline  of  the  oxygen-only  transmittance  spectrum  by  drawing  a  straight  line  from  the
transmittance at 1040 cm
−1
to the transmittance at 1160 cm
−1
.
12. 10  Locate  the  wavenumber  corresponding  to  the  minimum  transmittance  in  the  region  from  1102  cm
−1
to
1112 cm
−1
.    Record  the  value  of  that  wavenumber,  to  five  significant  figures,  as  W
p
.    Record  the  minimum
transmittance as T
p
, the transmittance at the absorption peak.  Record the baseline transmittance, T
b
, as the value of
the baseline defined in ¶12.9 at W
p
.  Record both T
p
and T
b
to three significant figures.
12. 11  Determine and record the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak.

15. 2  The  certification  measurements  were  made  using  a  short-baseline  procedure  similar  to  that  in  this  method
except that the endpoints of the baseline were taken as the average of the values between 1030 cm

and 1050 cm
−1

and between 1060 cm
−1
and 1080 cm
−1
, respectively.
15. 3  This uncertainty is expected to represent the best attainable precision with this method.
16  Bias
16. 1  The  uncertainty  in  the  absolute  determinations  of  oxygen  content  in  silicon  during  the  Grand  Round  Robin
resulted  primarily  from  the  uncertainty  in  the  chemical  analysis  measurements  and  any  variations  in  the  oxygen
content  of  the  various  slices  used  in  the  test.    The  first  of  these  is  estimated  to  be  about  6%,  and  the  second  is
estimated to be much smaller.
1
This uncertainty directly affects the assigned value of the IOC-88 calibration factor.
Errors in this calibration factor cause errors in the value of the derived oxygen content.  Therefore, the bias of these
measurements is estimated not to exceed 6%.

APPENDIX 1
ORIGINAL (LONG BASELINE) METHOD
NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI MF1188.  Approval was by full letter ballot
procedures with publication authorized by the NA Regional Standards Committee on December 10, 2004.
A1-1  Introduction
A1-1.1  §§1 through 8, 10, and 11 of the main test method also apply to this method.
A1-1.1.1  If a dispersive spectrophotemeter is being used, disregard ¶7.2.
A1-2  Procedure
A1-2.1  Instrumental Checks
A1-2.1.1  Establish the 100% baseline to measure the noise level.
A1-2.1.1.1  On  double  beam  instruments,  record  the  transmittance  spectrum  with  both  the  sample  and  reference
beams empty.
A1-2.1.1.2  On single-beam instruments, obtain the transmittance spectrum as the ratio of two spectra taken with the
sample beam empty.
A1-2.1.1.3  Plot the 100% baseline over a wavenumber range covering 900 cm
−1
to 1300 cm
−1
.  If the baseline is not
100%  ±  0.5%  over  the  entire  range,  increase  the  measurement  time  until  it  is.    If  the  problem  persists,  have  the
instrument repaired.
A1-2.1.2  Applies  to  dispersive  (DIR)  instruments  only.    Establish  the  0%  line.    With  the  sample  beam  blocked,
record the instrument zero over the range from 900 cm
−1
to 1300 cm
−1
.  If a significant non-zero signal is recorded in
that  range,  check  the  instrument  for  stray  light  reaching  the  detector.    If  the  problem  persists,  have  the  instrument

A1-2.1.3  Applies  to  Fourier  transform  (FT-IR)  instruments  only.    Record  the  throughput  characteristics  of  the
spectrophotometer by plotting a single-beam spectrum, obtained with the sample beam empty, over the wavenumber
range from 450 cm
−1
to 4000 cm

.  Use such a spectrum, recorded after the instrument has been properly aligned
according to factory specifications as a reference to evaluate the instrument's performance.  Whenever the spectrum
obtained deviates significantly from the instrument's reference spectrum, realign the instrument.

.  If the value of the transmittance is
not 53.8% ± 2% over this wavenumber range, align the sample with the spectrometer in accordance with ¶8.3.
A1-2.1.5  Determine  the  measurement  time  for  the  spectra  by  obtaining  the  transmittance  spectrum  of  a  high

12  ppma  and  18  ppma  oxygen  (IOC-88)  using  a  minimum  of  64  scans  for  FT-IR  instruments,  or,  for  dispersive
instruments, a speed such that the full peak height is recorded.  If the ratio of the net amplitude of the oxygen band,

, to the standard deviation in the transmittance spectrum is not greater than 100, increase the number of scans
(FT-IR) or reduce the scan speed (DIR) until that criterion is met.

their centers.  If thickness of the reference specimen does not match the thickness of the test specimen to within ±
0. 5%, obtain a reference specimen with the proper thickness.

double beam dispersive instruments, obtain the transmittance spectrum with the oxygen-free reference specimen in
the  reference  beam,  and  the  test  specimen  in  the  sample  beam.    On  single  beam  instruments,  compute  the
transmittance  spectrum  as  the  ratio  of  the  emission  spectrum  of  the  test  specimen  to  the  emission  spectrum  of  the
reference specimen.

A1-5.1  The  precision  of  this  test  method  depends  upon  the  thickness  of  the  test  specimen  and  its  oxygen  content.
The  single  instrument  repeatability  of  this  test  method  was  studied  in  an  international  experiment,  in  which  the
oxygen contents of equivalent sets of 20, 2 mm thick samples, with interstitial oxygen content ranging from 5 ppma
to  30  ppma  (IOC-88),  were  measured  by  18  different  laboratories.    The  single  instrument  repeatability  of  this  test
method, pooled over all 20 specimens in the test set, ranged from 0.4 to 1.2% (R1S) for the 18 laboratories in the
study.

A1-5.2  The multilaboratory reproducibility for the same sets of test specimens was determined in the same study,
with 18 participating laboratories, to be ± 3% (R1S).

A1-6  Bias
A1-6.1  This  experiment  also  included  measurements  of  the  absolute  oxygen  content  by  a  variety  of  physical
methods.    The  uncertainty  in  the  absolute  determinations  of  oxygen  content  in  silicon  during  the  Grand  Round
Robin results primarily from the uncertainty in the chemical analysis measurements and any variations in the oxygen
content  of  the  various  slices  used  in  the  test.    The  first  of  these  is  estimated  to  be  about  6%,  and  the  second  is
estimated to be much smaller.  This uncertainty directly affects the assigned value of the IOC-88 calibration factor.
Errors in this calibration factor cause errors in the value of the derived oxygen content.  Therefore, the bias of these
measurements from these sources is estimated not to exceed 6%.
A1-6.2  There  is  also  the  possibility  of  bias  because  of  interfering  peaks  in  the  infrared  spectrum  at  the
wavenumbers  where  the  baseline  is  determined.    The  magnitude  of  this  bias  varies  from  sample  to  sample  and
cannot be predicted.

TEST METHOD FOR OXYGEN PRECIPITATION CHARACTERISTICS
OF SILICON WAFERS BY MEASUREMENT OF INTERSTITIAL OXYGEN
REDUCTION
These  test  methods  were  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  are  the  direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the   North   American   Regional   Standards   Committee   on   December   10,   2004.      Initially   available   at
www.semi.org
January   2005;   to   be   published   March   2005.      Original   edition   published   by   ASTM
International as ASTM F 1239-89.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1239-02.
1  Purpose
1. 1  Oxide  precipitates  in  the  bulk  of  a  silicon  wafer  can  act  as  gettering  sites  for  contamination  that  may  be
introduced  during  manufacture  of  circuits  and  devices.    This  contamination  (usually  metallic  impurities),  if  not
gettered,  can  reduce  device  manufacturing  yields  and  degrade  device  or  circuit  performance.    Thus,  the  oxygen
precipitation characteristics of the silicon wafer can significantly affect both yields and performance.
1. 2  Although interstitial oxygen concentration is an important factor in affecting the amount of oxygen precipitation
that occurs in silicon during a specific thermal cycle, the presence of other impurities such as carbon or nitrogen, and
differences  in  dopant  type  and  density,  thermal  history,  or  defect  properties  of  the  crystal  can  also  affect  the
precipitation characteristics.  Thus, it is frequently necessary to choose particular material properties and preparation
techniques to obtain the desired precipitation characteristics for a particular application.
1. 3  This test method may be used to compare the oxygen reduction of two or more groups of silicon wafers.  This
test method is based on thermal cycles that simulate certain common device processing cycles.
1. 3.1  Cycle A, a one-step precipitation cycle, provides an indication of the native nucleation sites present in the as-
received wafers.
1. 3.2  Cycle  B,  a  two-step  nucleation-precipitation  cycle,  simulates  the  precipitation  that  occurs  in  normal  n-MOS
device processing.
1. 4  These test methods may be used to compare qualitatively the precipitation characteristics of two or more groups
of wafers.
1. 5  These  test  methods  may  also  be  used  to  determine  the  uniformity  of  oxygen  reduction  across  a  wafer  (in
conjunction with SEMI MF951) or from wafer to wafer within a lot.
2  Scope
2. 1  These  test  methods  cover  complementary  procedures  for  testing  the  oxygen  precipitation  characteristics  of
silicon wafers.  It is assumed that the precipitation characteristics are related to the amount of interstitial oxygen lost
during specified thermal cycles.
2. 2  These  test  methods  may  be  applied  to  any  n-  or  p-type  Czochralski  silicon  wafers  of  any  orientation  whose
thickness, resistivity, and surface finish are such as to permit the oxygen concentration to be determined by infrared
absorption and whose oxygen concentration is such as to produce measurable oxygen loss.
2. 3  These  test  methods  are  not  suitable  for  determining  the  width  or  characteristics  of  a  “denuded  zone,''  a  region
near the surface of a wafer that is essentially free of oxide precipitates.
2. 4  Because these test methods are destructive, suitable sampling techniques must be employed.
2. 5  Determination  of  material  performance  in  actual  device  fabrication  situations  is  beyond  the  scope  of  these
methods.    However,  by  comparing  the  results  of  these  tests  with  actual  device  yields  and  performance,  criteria  for
selection of specific material characteristics may be established.
2. 6  The values stated in SI units are regarded as standard.

NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.      It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  guides  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  All  factors  that  affect  the  infrared  absorption  measurement  (including  differences  in  back  surface  condition,
instrumental characteristics, and wafer resistivity) may cause errors in the determination of oxygen reduction.
3. 2  If  significant  quantities  of  oxygen  are  outdiffused  during  the  thermal  cycles,  the  measured  oxygen  reduction
may not be representative of the amount of oxygen precipitation.
3. 3  If  precipitate  size  varies  from  sample  to  sample,  the  variations  in  measured  oxygen  reduction  may  not  be
representative of variations in the number of oxide precipitates that are formed.
3. 4  The  specified  thermal  cycles  may  or  may  not  provide  adequate  simulation  of  the  cycles  used  in  a  particular
device processing sequence.  The results obtained in these test methods can serve as predictors of those expected in
actual device processing only to the extent that the simulation is representative of the device process.

6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1  A representative sample is selected from each group of wafers to be tested.
6. 2  The  initial  value  of  interstitial  oxygen  concentration  is  measured  by  the  infrared  absorption  method  at  the
desired points on each wafer.
6. 3  The wafers are passed through one of two simulation thermal cycles.  Cycle A consists solely of a precipitation
step.  Cycle B consists of a nucleation step followed by a precipitation step.
6. 4  After the thermal cycle, the oxide film is stripped and the final value of oxygen concentration is measured at the
same points on each wafer using the same technique and instrumentation as was used to determine the initial value.
6. 5  The  oxygen  reduction  is  determined  for  each  wafer  (or  for  each  point  on  each  wafer)  tested  as  the  difference
between the initial and final values.
6. 6  If all samples have the same initial oxygen concentration (within a narrow range), the average oxygen reduction
for each test condition (such as, group or position on wafer) is computed, and the appropriate comparisons made.
6. 7  If the samples have initial oxygen concentrations that cover a relatively wide range, a plot of oxygen reduction
against  initial  oxygen  concentration  is  made  for  each  group  or  position.    Again  appropriate  comparisons  can  be
made.

10  Selection and Preparation of Test Specimens
10. 1  Choose  test  wafers  from  each  group  being  tested  in  such  a  way  as  to  cover  the  entire  range  of  oxygen
concentration found in the group.  Choose at least two wafers with oxygen concentration in each 0.5 ppm (IOC-88)
4

interval in the range.  For example, if the oxygen concentration range of a group is 3 ppma, at least 12 wafers from
that group should be tested.
10. 2  Select  or  prepare  test  wafers  with  thickness,  resistivity,  and  surface  finish  as  required  by  the  oxygen  test
method being used.
10. 3  Identify  each  test  wafer  individually  with  an  alphanumeric  laser  marking  or  a  hand  scribed  code  unless  pre–
marked wafers are used.
10. 4  Prepare the wafers in accordance with SEMI MF1188, SEMI MF1619, DIN 50 438/1, or JEITA EM-3504, as
applicable.
11  Procedure
11. 1  Determine  the  initial  interstitial  oxygen  concentration  of  each  wafer  to  be  tested  at  the  center  in  accordance
with SEMI MF1188, SEMI MF1619, DIN 50 438/1, or JEITA EM-3504.  If desired, measure the interstitial oxygen
concentration at other locations on each wafer as specified by an appropriate pattern in SEMI MF951.  Record the
oxygen value(s), the wafer identification, and measurement locations.  Record the date of the test and the instrument
used in measuring the oxygen concentration.  See Figure 1 for a suggested data sheet format.
11. 2  Clean and dry the wafers in accordance with the usual wafer cleaning procedure employed by the laboratory
performing the test.
11. 3  Process  the  samples  as  soon  after  cleaning  as  possible.    If  the  samples  must  be  stored  between  cleaning  and
processing, store in clean covered cassettes.
11. 4  Heat-treat in accordance with Cycle A or Cycle B, (see Table 1).  Record the date of the heat treatment and the
cycle used.
11. 5  Strip the surface oxide from the wafers with hydrofluoric acid (HF), and thoroughly clean and dry them with
the usual wafer cleaning procedure employed by the laboratory performing the test.
11. 6  Measure the post-heat treatment interstitial oxygen concentration at each point measured before heat treatment.
Use  the  same  instrument,  test  method,  and  set  up  for  this  measurement  as  was  used  for  the  initial  measurement.
Record each final oxygen concentration on the same data sheet as was used to record initial oxygen concentration.

12  Calculations and Interpretation of Results
12. 1  Subtract  each  final  oxygen  concentration  value  from  the  corresponding  initial  oxygen  concentration  value  to
determine the oxygen reduction.  Record the oxygen reduction.
12. 2  Interpret the results by Method 1 or Method 2 as follows:
12. 2.1  Method 1
12. 2.1.1  Use this method when the desired target oxygen concentration is already known, when each group tested
has  the  same  target  oxygen  concentration,  and  when  the  range  of  oxygen  concentration  values  measured  in  each
group  has  a  range  less  than  4  ppma  (IOC-88).    This  method  cannot  be  used  if  the  average  initial  oxygen
concentrations of the groups tested differ by more than 0.5 ppma (IOC-88).

12. 2.1.2  Determine  the  averages  and  standard  deviations  of  the  initial  oxygen  concentration  and  oxygen  reduction
for each group of wafers tested.


SEMI MF1239-0305 © SEMI 2003, 2005 6
12. 2.1.3  If the average oxygen reduction values of the groups tested agree to within a desired amount, consider the
groups equivalent.
12. 2.2  Method 2
12. 2.2.1  Use  this  method  to  de-couple  oxygen  content  and  precipitation  behavior  to  obtain  (1)  a  qualitative
overview of the precipitation characteristics of the groups tested and (2) the important features of the characteristic
precipitation curve.

12. 2.2.5  Note that the curves have three characteristic regions, as illustrated by distinct slope change in Figure 4 and
Figure  5.    At  low  initial  oxygen  concentration,  there  is  essentially  no  oxygen  reduction;  at  some  value  of  initial

oxygen  concentration,  partial  precipitation  occurs  (in  this  transition  region,  oxygen  reduction  changes  rapidly  with
increasing  initial  oxygen  concentration);  at  high  initial  oxygen  concentration,  full  precipitation  occurs  (in  this
region, oxygen reduction is proportional to initial oxygen concentration).
12. 2.2.6  Compare  the  curves  obtained  for  each  group.    If  the  data  for  each  group  falls  within  a  band  of  suitable
width, consider the groups equivalent.
13  Report
13. 1  Report the following for each group tested:
13. 1.1  Identification of group (lot number, location of measurement point on wafer, center or edge, etc.),
13. 1.2  Dates  of  initial  and  final  oxygen  measurement  and  of  the  heat  treatment  and  identification  of  operators  for
measurement and heat treatment,
13. 1.3  Identification of infrared spectrophotometer used,
13. 1.4  Table of initial and final oxygen concentrations for each wafer measured, and
13. 1.5  Averages and standard deviations of the initial oxygen content and oxygen reduction for each group tested.
13. 2  In addition, if Method 2 was used, report the following:
13. 2.1  Table of average initial oxygen concentration and average oxygen reduction for each bin in each group, and
13. 2.2  Graph of average oxygen reductions against average initial oxygen concentrations for each group.
14  Precision
14. 1  Wafers from six different groups with different back surface conditions were processed in two laboratories and
combined.  Both Cycles A and B were used.  Measurements of initial and final oxygen concentrations on all wafers
tested were made at two other laboratories.
14. 2  The wafers within each group did not meet the 2-wafer per 0.5 ppma interval required by these test methods.
14. 3  Nevertheless, from the plots reproduced as Figures 2 through 5, both measurement laboratories (that employed
different  FT-IR  spectrophotometers  for  making  the  oxygen  determinations  at  the  center  of  the  wafers  only)
concluded that the wafers from Groups V1, V3, V4, V5, and V6 were essentially equivalent but those from Group
V2 had increased precipitation in the transition region.
15  Bias
15. 1  No  reference  standards  are  available  for  precipitated  oxygen,  so  it  is  impossible  to  determine  bias  except  for
that of the individual oxygen measurements.  Bias of the individual oxygen measurements should be determined in
accordance with the procedures of the test method utilized.

TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING OXYGEN CONCENTRATION IN
HEAVILY DOPED SILICON SUBSTRATES BY SECONDARY ION MASS
SPECTROMETRY
These  test  methods  were  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  are  the  direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the   North   American   Regional   Standards   Committee   on   December   10,   2004.      Initially   available   at
www.semi.org
January   2005;   to   be   published   March   2005.      Original   edition   published   by   ASTM
International as ASTM F 1366-92.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1366-02.
1  Purpose
1. 1  The  presence  of  oxygen  can  be  beneficial  to  certain  manufacturing  operations  by  preventing  the  formation  of
process-induced defects.  Oxygen is introduced into silicon wafers during the crystal growing process.  Hence, it is
very important to control the oxygen content of silicon crystals.
1. 2  SIMS can measure the oxygen concentration in heavily-doped silicon substrates used for epitaxial silicon where
the  free  carrier  concentration  obscures  the  infrared  absorption  and  prevents  the  normal  use  of  the  infrared
measurement as a characterization technique for the commercial production of silicon.
1. 3  The  SIMS  measurement  allows  for  the  production  of  controlled  oxygen  content  in  heavily-doped  silicon
crystals.
1. 4  This test method can be used for process control, research and development, and materials acceptance purposes.
2  Scope
2. 1  This  test  method  covers  the  determination  of  total  oxygen  concentration  in  the  bulk  of  single  crystal  silicon
substrates using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).
2. 2  This  test  method  can  be  used  for  silicon  in  which  the  dopant  concentrations  are  less  than  0.2%  (1  ×  10
20
atoms/cm
3
)  for  boron,  antimony,  arsenic,  and  phosphorus  (see  SEMI  MF723).    This  test  method  is  especially
applicable for silicon that has resistivity between 0.0012 and 1.0 Ω·cm for p-type silicon and between 0.008 and 0.2
Ω·cm for n-type silicon (see SEMI MF43).
2. 3  This  test  method  can  be  used  for  silicon  in  which  the  oxygen  content  is  greater  than  the  SIMS  instrumental
oxygen background as measured in a float zone silicon sample, but the test method has a useful precision especially
when the oxygen content is much greater (approximately 10× to 20×) than the measured oxygen background in the
float zone silicon.
2. 4  This test method is complementary to infrared absorption spectroscopy that can be used for the measurement of
interstitial oxygen in silicon that has resistivity greater than 1.0 Ω·cm for p-type silicon and greater than 0.1 Ω·cm
for  n-type silicon (see SEMI MF1188).  The infrared absorption measurement can be extended to between 0.02 and
0. 1 Ω·cm for n-type silicon with minor changes in the measurement procedure.

2. 5  In principle, different sample surfaces can be used, but the precision estimate was taken from data on chemical-
mechanical polished surfaces.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.      It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  guides  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  Oxygen from silicon oxide, carbon oxide, and water on the surface can interfere with the oxygen measurement.
3. 2  Oxygen adsorbed from the SIMS instrument chamber to the surface can interfere with the oxygen measurement.

Measurements,” J. Electrochem. Soc. 137, 3926 (1990).


SEMI MF1366-0305 © SEMI 2003, 2005 2
3. 3  There  are  no  effects  upon  the  oxygen  ion  yield  from  the  dopants  for  dopant  densities  less  than  1  ×  10
20

atoms/cm

.

3. 4  The SIMS oxygen instrumental background as measured on the float zone silicon specimen should be as low as
possible and stable before the analyses are begun.
3. 5  The  specimen  surface  must  be  flat  in  the  specimen  holder  windows  so  that  the  inclination  of  the  specimen
surface with respect to the ion collection optics is constant from specimen to specimen.  Otherwise, the accuracy and
precision can be degraded.
3. 6  The accuracy and precision of the measurement significantly degrade as the roughness of the specimen surface
increases.  This degradation can be avoided by using chemical-mechanical polished surfaces.
3. 7  Variability of oxygen in the calibration standards can limit the measurement precision.
3. 8  Bias in the assigned oxygen of the calibration standards can introduce bias into the SIMS measured oxygen.

6. 1.1  Specimens  of  single  crystal  silicon  (one  float-zone  silicon  specimen,  two  calibration  specimens,  and  the  test
specimen) are loaded into a sample holder.
6. 1.2  The holder with the specimens is baked at 100°C in air for 1 h and then transferred into the analysis chamber
of the SIMS instrument.
6. 1.3  A  cesium  primary  ion  beam  is  used  to  bombard  each  specimen.  The  negative  secondary  ions  are  mass
analyzed.
6. 1.4  The specimens are presputtered sequentially to reduce the instrumental oxygen background.
6. 1.5  The  specimens  are  then  analyzed,  in  locations  different  from  the  presputtering  locations,  for  oxygen  and
silicon in a sequential manner throughout the holder.  Three measurement passes are made through the holder.
6. 1.6  The  ratio  of  the  measured  oxygen  and  silicon  secondary  ion  intensities  (O
−
/Si
−
)  is  calculated  for  each
specimen.
6. 1.7  The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the ratio is then calculated for each specimen.
6. 1.8  If any specimen other than the float zone specimen has a RSD of the ratio greater than 3%, more analyses are
performed.
6. 1.9  The SIMS average O/Si ratios are then converted to infrared-equivalent concentrations by utilizing either the
load-line calibration method
5
,

or the load factor calibration method

with the calibration specimens in the load.
7  Apparatus
7. 1  SIMS  Instrument,  equipped  with  a  cesium  primary  ion  source,  electron  multiplier  detector  and  Faraday  cup
detector, and capable of measuring negative secondary ions.
7. 1.1  The  SIMS  instrument  should  be  adequately  prepared  (that  is,  baked)  so  as  to  provide  the  lowest  possible
instrumental background.
7. 2  Cryopane1,  liquid  nitrogen-  or  liquid  helium-cooled,  which  surrounds  the  test  specimen  holder  in  the  analysis
chamber.
7. 3  Test Specimen Holder.
7. 4  Oven, for baking test specimen holder.
8  Sampling
8. 1  Since this procedure is destructive in nature, a sampling procedure must be used to evaluate the characteristics
of  a  group  of  silicon  wafers.    No  general  sampling  procedure  is  included  as  part  of  this  test  method,  because  the
most  suitable  sampling  plan  will  vary  considerably  depending  upon  individual  conditions.  For referee purposes, a
sampling plan shall be agreed upon before conducting the test.  See ASTM Practice E 122 for suggested choices of
sampling plans.
9  Specimen Requirements
9. 1  Sample specimens must be flat and smooth on the side used for analysis.
9. 2  Sample specimens must be cleaved or diced to fit within the sample specimen holder.
10  Calibration
10. 1  The  two  calibration  standards  in  each  load  must  be  lightly  doped  Czochralski  silicon

in  which  the  oxygen
concentration is measured by infrared absorption spectroscopy (see SEMI MF1188), and the measured values of the

two standards bracket the expected values for the test specimen (that is, one calibration standard is higher in oxygen
and one is lower, compared to the expected value in the test specimen).
10. 2  The  calibration  standards  must  be  measured  by  infrared  absorption  to  determine  the  concentration  and
homogeneity of the oxygen within the standards; each standard is assigned the averaged infrared absorption oxygen
value (IOC-88) for the substrate.
10. 3  Calibration standards that are included in the SIMS analyses must be taken from that portion of the wafer that
provided  a  homogeneous  measurement  in  the  Fourier  transform  infrared  (FT-IR)  spectrophotometer  analysis;  this
portion is typically the central portion of the wafer.
10. 4  Each  calibration  standard  specimen  must  be  the  same  size  and  have  the  same  polished  surface  as  the  test
specimen.
10. 5  The  float  zone  specimens  that  are  included  in  the  SIMS  analysis  to  measure  the  instrumental  oxygen
background  must  be  measured  by  infrared  absorption  to  determine  if  the  oxygen  concentration  is  low  enough  to
measure the instrumental SIMS background.  Oxygen concentrations below 0.5 ppma in the float zone specimen are
normally sufficient.
10. 6  Each float zone specimen must be the same size and have the same polished surface as the test specimen.
11  Procedure
11. 1  Specimen Loading
11. 1.1  Load  the  specimens  into  the  SIMS  sample  holder,  checking  to  see  that  the  specimens  are  flat  against  the
backs  of  the  windows  and  cover  the  windows  as  much  as  is  possible.    A  specimen  load  includes  one  float  zone
silicon specimen, two or more standard specimens, and the test specimen.
11. 1.2  Bake the loaded sample holder at 100°C ± 10°C for a minimum of 1 h in air.
11. 2  Instrument Tuning
11. 2.1  Turn on the instrument in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
11. 2.2  Fill the liquid nitrogen or helium cold trap.
11. 3  Analytical Conditions
11. 3.1  Use  a  cesium  primary  ion  current  and  focus,  which  maximizes the ion count rate for an appropriate silicon
isotope.
11. 3.2  Typical analytical conditions are a 250 μm by 250 μm raster and 1-s integrations.  Choose apertures to keep
the oxygen count rate on the electron multiplier detector below 1 × 10
5
counts per second for the test specimen.
11. 4  Analysis of Specimen
11. 4.1  Position  the  specimen  holder  so  that  the  sputtered  crater  in  the  specimen  will  form  near  the  center  of  the
window.
11. 4.2  Center the primary ion beam and begin a SIMS profile.
11. 4.3  Repeat ¶11.4.1 and ¶11.4.2 for all the specimens in the holder until all the specimens have been presputtered.
This is called a presputtering round and is intended to reduce the instrumental oxygen background.  No oxygen data
are taken or used from these profiles.
11. 4.4  Now  make  a  second  round  of  measurements  on  all  the  samples  according  ¶11.4.1  and  ¶11.4.2,  but  in
locations near the presputtered craters of the specimen.  Do not make the second round of measurements in the same
craters as the presputter craters.
11. 4.5  At  the  end  of  each  profile  in  the  second  round  of  craters,  measure  and  record  the
16
O
−
count  rate  on  the
electron multiplier detector and the
30
Si
−
, or other Si isotope as appropriate, matrix ion count rate on the Faraday cup
detector.


SEMI MF1366-0305 © SEMI 2003, 2005 5
11. 4.6  Repeat  ¶11.4.4  and  ¶11.4.5  for  a  third  and  fourth  round  of  measurements,  all  in  their  own  separate  craters.
Group all the analyses for each specimen near the center of the window but do not overlap.  The raster area for each
analysis must be the same.
11. 4.7  Calculate  the  ratio  S(O
−
/Si
−
)  of  oxygen  count  rate  to  silicon  count  rate  using  the  recorded  secondary  ion
intensities at the end of each profile in the second, third, and fourth rounds of profiles, thus obtaining three ratios per
specimen.
11. 4.8  Calculate the average S
avg
(O
−
/Si
−
) of the three ratios for each specimen in the holder.
11. 4.9  Compare the average ratio S
avg-FZ
(O
−
/Si
−
) for the float zone specimen to the average ratio S
avg-sp
(O
−
/Si
−
) of
the other specimens.  If the average ratio for the float zone specimens is not much less (approximately 10 times less)
than the average ratio for the other specimens, then the precision of the measurement may be degraded.  In this case,
depending upon the desired precision, it may be necessary to either abort the analysis and find the cause of the high
instrumental background, or to increase the number of measurements per specimen.
11. 4.10  Calculate the relative standard deviation (RSD percent) of the ratio S(O
−
/Si
−
) for each specimen, including
the calibration specimen, the float zone specimen, and the test specimen.
11. 4.11  Repeat the analysis of oxygen for specimens (other than float zone specimens) with a RSD percent greater
than 3%.
11. 4.12  Record  the  specimen  identification,  O
−
/Si
−
ratios,  average,  standard  deviation,  and  relative  standard
deviation in a table and include the same for the float zone silicon specimen.

and
13. 1.5  The relative standard deviations (RSD percent) of the oxygen values for the test specimen and the float zone

14  Precision
14. 1  The  precision  was  estimated  for  both  the  load  line  calibration  and  average  load  factor  calibration  procedures
using 191 samples from one silicon wafer and measured in 191 different loads over a two-month period.  The one
standard  deviation  was  0.38  ppma  for  both  methods  for  an  oxygen  level  of  18  ppma.    The  data  are  given  in
Appendix 1.
14. 2  The  load  line  and  average  load  line  methods  to  quantification  gave  equivalent  accuracy  and  precision  in  the
test outlined in ¶14.1.  The reason one is used versus another is more conceptual than empirical if the oxygen values
for the standards bracket the oxygen values of the test specimens.

APPENDIX 1
ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE MULTI-INSTRUMENT EXPERIMENT
NOTICE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  MF1366.    Approval  was  by  full  letter  ballot
procedures with publication authorized by the NA Regional Standards Committee on December 10, 2004.
A1-1    The  precision  estimate  was  taken  from  data  generated  in  one  laboratory  using  three  instruments  and  ten
instrument operators.  All the instruments were CAMECA IMS 3f or 4f SIMS instruments.  The test specimens were
all  taken  from  one  silicon  wafer  that  was  lightly  doped  and  verified  by  infrared  absorption  spectroscopy  to  have
uniform interstitial oxygen levels across the central region where the test specimens were taken.  The test specimens
were chemically mechanically polished on one side.  The standards had oxygen levels that bracketed the expected
level of oxygen of the test specimen.
A1-2  The measurements were made in 191 loads over a two-month period.
A1-3  Both the load line calibration and the average load factor calibration methods were used to convert the SIMS
data  to  infrared  absorption  equivalent  oxygen.    The  load  line  calibration  method  gave  an  average  oxygen  level  of
18. 64  ppma  (IOC-88),  a  one  standard  deviation  of  0.39  ppma,  and  a  relative  standard  deviation  of  2.09%.    A
frequency distribution is shown in Figure A1-1.  The average load factor calibration method gave an average oxygen
level of 18.61 ppma (IOC-88), a one standard deviation of 0.365 ppma, and a relative standard deviation of 1.97%.
A frequency distribution is shown in Figure A1-2.
NOTE 1:  The oxygen concentration scale in Figures A1-1 and A1-2 is given in Old ASTM units.  These must be multiplied by
0. 652 to get the values of oxygen concentration in IOC-88 units.  This difference in scale arises from an historical basis and does
not affect the conclusions reached.  Note also that the oxygen values in §A1-3 have been adjusted to obtain the results in IOC-88
units.

TEST METHODS FOR PHOTOLUMINESCENCE ANALYSIS OF SINGLE
CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  for  publication  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  March  14,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org
May
2004;  to  be  published  July  2004.    Original  edition  published  by  ASTM  International  as  ASTM  F  1389-92.
Last previous edition SEMI MF1389-00.
1 Purpose
1. 1 Electronic-grade  polycrystalline  silicon  producers
and  users  require  information  regarding  impurities  for
quality    assurance    as    well    as    for    research    and
development purposes.  Polysilicon is float-zoned and a
sample  from  the  zoned  rod  is  analyzed  following  these
test  methods  to  obtain  impurity  densities  that  can  be
related  to  the  impurity  content  of  the  starting  material
(see SEMI MF1723).
1. 2      Photoluminescence      analysis      identifies      and
quantifies  the  electrically  active  dopant  impurities  in
monocrystalline  silicon.    These  test  methods  address
boron,  phosphorus,  arsenic,  and  aluminum,  found  as
impurities in electronic grade silicon.
1. 3  These  test  methods  can  be  applied  to  doped  and
undoped float-zoned or Czochralski material.
2 Scope
2. 1    These    test    methods    cover    the    simultaneous
determination  of  electrically  active  boron,  phosphorus,
arsenic,   and   aluminum   content   in   low-dislocation
monocrystalline silicon.
NOTE  1:    These  chemical  species  can  also  be  determined  by
the  low  temperature  infrared  analysis  procedure  of  SEMI
MF1630.
2. 2  These  test  methods  can  be  used  for  samples  that
have  dopant  densities  between  approximately  1  ×  10
11

and approximately 5 × 10
15
atoms/cm
3
.
2. 3    The    concentrations    obtained    using    these    test
methods   are   based   on   an   empirically   determined
relationship of the logarithm of the concentration to the
logarithm of specific luminescence line-intensity ratios.
2. 4  The  empirical  relationship  established  assumes  a
constant  sample  excitation  level  for  all  measurements
on a given instrument.
2. 5   To   accommodate   differences   in   instrumentation,
two  methods  are  included.    Test  Method  A  refers  to
procedures     appropriate     for     dispersive     infrared
spectrophotometers  operating  under  the  high  sample
excitation   conditions   and   Test   Method   B   refers   to
procedures      appropriate      for      Fourier      transform
instruments operating under low excitation conditions.
2. 5.1  Typical  calibration  curves  for  each  test  method
are  provided.    These  curves  are  modified  for  each
instrument  using  the  analysis  of  standard  samples  as
reference  data.    Once  modified,  the  curves  for  a  given
instrument   should   produce   sample   dopant   density
values    that    agree    with    other    similarly    operated
instruments using the same test method.  Data obtained
using Test Method A may not agree with data obtained
using  Test  Method  B,  hence  values  must  be  reported
with reference to the test method used.
NOTE 2:  Several  different methods  of  photoluminescence
analysis  are  currently  in  practice  worldwide.    These  test
methods  address  two  of  these,  one  (Test  Method  A)  in  use
primarily in Japan
1
and the other (Test Method B) primarily in
the United States.  Recently published works
2,3
describe other
approaches.
2. 6    Many    laboratories    use    photoluminescence    to
analyze   epitaxial   layers.      However   this   application
encounters  many  variables  and  the  underlying  physics
is not fully understood; hence these test methods do not
attempt  to  outline  standard  practices  regarding  such
analysis.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  guides  and  determine  the
applicability  of  regulatory  or  other  limitations  prior  to
use.

3 Limitations
3. 1 Variations  in  Excitation  Intensity  —  The  extrinsic
bound  exciton  (BE)  and  intrinsic  free  exciton  (FE)
luminescence features do not vary at the same rate with
excitation    intensity.
4
The    FE    features    increase
proportionally  with  excitation  intensity,  while  the  BE
features increase proportionally at low excitation levels
but become more slowly increasing at higher excitation
levels  generally  above  the  electron  hole  droplet  (EHD)
onset  point.    Since  the  calculated  concentrations  are
derived   from   the   ratio   of   extrinsic   features   to   the
intrinsic  feature,  the  ratio  will  be  decreasing  as  the
excitation  intensity  is  increasing.    Thus,  if  a  sample  is
measured   at   a   higher   excitation   level   than   the
instrument      is      calibrated      for,      the      calculated
concentration will be artificially low, and vice versa.
3. 2   Sample   surface   damage,   bulk   defects,   or   other
lifetime reducers also affect the line-intensity ratios and
overall  luminescence  intensity  owing  to  their  tendency
to  reduce  the  steady  state  population  of  excitons,  thus
mimicking  the  effects  of  a  lower  excitation  intensity.
Other  mechanisms  related  to  the  presence  of  these
defects may also introduce decalibrating effects.  Some
luminescence  features  are  generated  by  defects;  for
example,  those  at  6510  and  7050  cm
−1
are  typical  of
thermally  stressed  samples.    Such  features  can  provide
qualitative information about the presence of defects.
5,6

3. 3    The    ratios    and    line    widths    of    the    silicon
luminescence  features  vary  strongly  with  temperature,
hence   variations   in   sample   temperature   must   be
avoided.    Corrections  for  the  effects  of  temperature
variations   are   included   in   these   test   methods   (see
Section 7.1).
3. 4 Overlapping Spectral Features
3. 4.1 The   boron   B
TO
(BE)   feature   at   8812.6   cm
−1

overlaps  the  P
TO
(b′
1
)  feature  at  8812.7  cm
−1
causing  a
direct error when calculating boron concentration.  The
beta-series  P
TO
(b′
1
)  line  is  approximately  one-tenth  the
intensity  of  the  alpha  series  P
TO
(BE)  line  at  8806.6
cm
−1
,   so   a   subtraction   based   on   the   amount   of
phosphorus  present  can  be  made  in  the  boron    feature
measurement.    An  alternative  approach  is  to  use  the
B
TO
(b
1
)  boron  line,  which  is  free  from  a  coincident

phosphorus   line,   provided   the   instrument   has   been
calibrated for this feature.
3. 4.2  The  antimony  Sb
TO
(BE)  line  falls  between  the
boron and phosphorus transverse optical (TO) features.
Since  the  line  widths  are  broad  relative  to  the  line
positions  of  these  features,  the  presence  of  antimony
affects the apparent intensities of boron and phosphorus
TO  features.    The  no-phonon,  (NP)  features  for  these
elements  could  be  used  providing  the  instrument  is
calibrated for them.
3. 4.3  In  general,  the  broad  TO  phonon  region  features
can   interfere,   particularly   when   a   sample   contains
widely  differing  levels  of  impurities.    For  example,
when  boron  greatly  exceeds  phosphorus,  the  P
NP
(BE)
line   must   be   used,   and   when   phosphorus   greatly
exceeds  boron,  one  of  the  approaches  described  in
Section 3.4.1 must be used.
3. 5   Stress   in   samples   can   cause   NP   region   feature
splitting  and  thus  affect  the  established  TO/NP  line
ratio   for   a   given   impurity.      The   concentrations
calculated  from  such  spectra  would  be  artificially  low.
Peak      area      calculation      methods      reduce      the
measurement's sensitivity to line splitting effects.
3. 6   The   calibration   curves   presented   in   these   test
methods  are  traceable  to  resistivity  measurements  (see
SEMI  MF723),  neutron  transmutation  doped,  (NTD)
reference    material,    and    low-temperature    infrared
absorption  spectroscopy  (FT-IR)  measurements  (as  a
secondary   standard)   (see   SEMI   MF1630).      Hence
inaccuracies  in  the  work  that  produced  the  calibration
curves impact the accuracy of the PL results.

5 Terminology
5. 1 Definitions
5. 1.1 defect luminescence lines — those features arising
from defect structures in the silicon.
5. 1.2 electron  hole  droplet  (EHD)  —  the  condensed
phase   (liquid)   of   the   excitonic   gas   generated   by
photoexcitation.
5. 1.2.1  Discussion    —    The    exciton    population    is
dependent upon excitation intensity and can be raised to
the point where the exciton density is sufficient to allow
condensation   of   the   exciton   gas   into   a   liquid   like
exciton state.
8
The existence of EHD luminescence can
be an indirect measurement of excitation power density
on the sample.
5. 1.2.2    EHD  onset  occurs  at  the  point  in  the  sample
excitation   intensity   curve   where   the   electron-hole-
droplet   begins   to   form.
9
The   EHD   luminescence
includes a very broad feature underlying the TO region
impurity    lines    which,    with    increasing    excitation
intensity,  both  intensifies  and  shifts  to  lower    energies
relative to the other silicon luminescence features.
5. 1.3 excitons — the electron-hole pairs that give rise to
the  luminescence  of  interest  upon  recombination  at
either  a  free  lattice  site  (free  exciton)  or  an  impurity
atom site (bound exciton).
5. 1.4 extrinsic   line   (X
TO
(BE)   or   X
NP
(BE))   —   the
luminescence that arises from an exciton captured by an
impurity site in the crystal lattice (a bound exciton).
5. 1.4.1  Discussion  —  Its  energy  is  lower  than  the
intrinsic  emission  by  an  amount  related  to  the  exciton
binding  energy  of  the  impurity  at  4.2  K.    “X”  is  the
impurity  element  symbol  and  “BE”  indicates  bound
exciton luminescence line.  Extrinsic luminescence also
includes   features   attributed   to   bound   multi-exciton
complexes (b

, b
2
, or b

would indicate the first, second
and     third     bound     multi-exciton     complex     lines,
respectively).  In donor luminescence, these complexes

5. 1.5.1  Discussion   —   “I”   indicates   intrinsic   silicon
emission, “TO” indicates the transverse optical phonon
associated  with  the  transition,  and  “FE”  refers  to  the
free exciton recombination responsible for the emission
(see Table 1 for line locations).
5. 1.6 phonon —   a   quantum   of   lattice   vibrational
energy,  as  a  photon  is  a  quantum  of  electromagnetic
energy.
5. 1.6.1  Discussion — The recombination of excitons in
silicon  requires  a  momentum  conserving  mechanism
owing to the indirect band gap of the crystal.  Phonons
provide such a mechanism.  The principal phonon types
of  interest  in  silicon    luminescence  are  the  transverse
acoustic (TA), transverse optical (TO), and longitudinal
optical  (LO)  phonons.    These  test  methods  address  the
use  of  features  associated  with  the  TO  phonon  as  well
as   those   not   including   phonon   emission   in   their
momentum-conserving processes.  These latter features
are designated “NP” or no-phonon features.
6 Summary of Test Method
6. 1 A sample of monocrystalline silicon is cooled to 4.2
K  and  photoexcited  with  greater-than-bandgap  energy
light at one of two intensities listed, depending upon the
type of instrument used.  The resulting luminescence is
collected and recorded.  Spectral features corresponding
to  intrinsic  silicon  and  extrinsic  impurity  emissions  are
measured  and  related  to  calibration  curves  to  yield
dopant density.
7 Apparatus
7. 1 Cryostat  —  To  maintain  sample  temperature  at  4.2
K.      Either   open-cycle   liquid   helium   immersion   or
exchange  gas  cryostats,  or  closed-cycle  refrigeration
systems   may   be   used.      The   bath   immersion   type
cryostat  is  recommended  for  higher  confidence  in  the
temperature   stability   of   the   sample.      In   both   the
exchange    gas    and    closed-cycle    systems,    careful
attention  must  be  paid  to  thermal  sinking  and  accurate
sample temperature measurement (see Section 3.3).
7. 2 Sample  Holder  —  Which  does  not  cause  excessive
strain  on  the  ample  through  spring  forces  or  other
means,  so  as  to  avoid  line  splitting  associated  with
crystal stresses.
7. 3 Laser  Excitation  Source  —  Capable  of  generating
electron hole pairs in the silicon crystal.  An argon-ion
laser operated at 514.5 nm is used.  To obtain accurate
measurements, laser light intensity must be controllable
and stable.
7. 4 Infrared  Spectrophotometer  —  Equipped  with  a
detector  and  optics  suitable  for  use  between  8750  and
9300 cm
−1
, and capable of at least 0.5 cm
−1
resolution at
9300 cm

8. 6 Hazards —  Chemicals  used  in  this  procedure  are
potentially   harmful   and   must   be   handled   with   the
utmost care at all times.
9 Sample Preparation
9. 1 Perform either the procedure in Section 9.1.1 or the
procedure  in  Section  9.1.2  to  remove  all  work  damage
and  surface  contamination  on  all  samples  except  as-
received chemical-mechanically polished wafers, which
do not need further preparation.
9. 1.1 Etch sample using a suitable etchant (for example,
the   acid   cleaning   mixture   of   Section   8.5   or   CP-5
hydrofluoric-nitric-acetic acid etchant).
9. 1.2  Polish  the  surface  of  the  sample  with  a  suitable
chemical-mechanical polishing compound.
9. 2   Luminescence   efficiency   has   been   observed   to
decrease  after  etching,  thus  introduction  of  the  sample
into  the  cryostat  within  a  few  hours  of  etching  is
recommended.          Chemical-mechanically     polished
samples appear to be more stable.

10 Instrument Calibration
10. 1  Measurement  of  silicon  standards  need  only  be
performed  once  unless  instrument  characteristics  have
drifted  or  hardware  changes  have  been  made.    The
regular   use   of   secondary   standard   samples,   herein
referred  to  as  audit  samples,  provides  a  mechanism  for
instrument  calibration  verification  and  generates  long-
term  instrument  performance  statistics.    At  least  four
standard  samples  should  be  used  for  each  impurity
calibration curve adjustment.
10. 1.1  Obtain  samples  with  known  impurity  densities
and  collect  luminescence  spectra  at  the  appropriate
excitation  intensity  listed  in  Section  11.1  using  both
standard and high resolution as listed in Section 11.2.2.
10. 1.2  Find  the  peak  intensities  as  described  in  Section
12  and  find  the  ratios  of  appropriate  spectral  lines  as
described in Section 13.1.
10. 1.3  Adjust  calibration  data  of  Figure  1  or  Figure  2,
corresponding  to  Test  Method  A  or  Test  Method  B,
respectively,  by  translating  the  curves  such  that  they
intersect points corresponding to PL data of the known
samples.    Make  no  change  to  the  slope  of  the  curves
because   the   slopes   are   a   function   of   the   exciton
recombination dynamics only and are independent of a
given instrument’s optical response.
10. 1.4   These   curves   become   the   given   instrument’s
calibration curves for the analysis conditions used.
10. 2  Determine  the  short-term  one-sigma  precision  of
the instrument.
NOTE   3:      This   procedure   needs   to   be   performed   only
occasionally  unless  instrument  characteristics  have  drifted  or
hardware changes have been made.
10. 2.1  Analyze  a  sample  with  impurity  concentrations
similar to typical samples analyzed by the instrument in
normal operation nine times.
10. 2.2  Find  the  peak  intensity  as  described  in  Section
12 to obtain dopant densities.
10. 2.3  Calculate  the  open-sigma  standard  deviation  for
all impurities present.
11 Procedure
11. 1 Excitation Conditions
11. 1.1 Test    Method    A—High    Excitation    Intensity
Conditions  —  Set  the  output  of  the  argon  ion  laser  to
300  mW  of  514.5  nm  light.    Pass  the  beam  through  an
infrared  cutoff  filter  and  a  chopper  with  a  50%  duty
cycle.  Beam can be reflected with 2 to 3 mirrors with a
nominal  1-m  distance  between  sample  and  laser.    Pass
the unfocused beam through the cryostat windows.  Set
the beam diameter to 2.5 mm.

11. 1.2 Test    Method    B—Low    Excitation    Intensity
Conditions   —   Set   laser   intensity   such   that   the
luminescence  is  as  close  to  the  EHD  onset  point  as
practical  from  signal-to-noise  considerations.    Collect
luminescence  spectra  of  the  sample  used  in  Section
10. 2    at    several    different    laser    beam    intensities,
extending  from  well  above  to  as  far  below  the  EHD

considerations.  Plot the EHD luminescence intensity at

versus the laser intensity used on linear axes.
The    EHD    onset    power    can    be    determined    by
extrapolating  the  nonzero  EHD  points  down  to  zero
intensity using a straight line.

(1142–1125 nm)
NP region—9242–9294 cm

(1082–1076 nm)
11. 2.2 Resolution
Standard resolution = 2 cm
−1
(or 0.2 nm)
High resolution = 0.5 cm
−1
(or 0.05 nm)
Use  standard  resolution  when  calculation  of  aluminum
or   arsenic   concentrations   is   not   desired   or   not
necessary.  Otherwise, use high resolution.
11. 3 Audit   Specimen   Analysis   —   Keep   one   set   of
specimens as secondary standards to periodically check
instrument performance.  Make sure that at least one of
these samples reflects typical material properties for the
laboratory  concerned.    Analyze  at  least  one  of  these
samples   with   each   batch   of   unknown   samples   to
confirm reproducibility of analysis conditions from run
to run.
11. 3.1 Collect luminescence spectra of audit specimens
before unknown samples, preferably in the same sample
holder  batch  using  parameters  listed  in  Sections  11.1
and 11.2.2. Reduce spectral data as described in Section

# 12

12.
11. 3.2  If  the  audit  specimen  results  fall  outside  the
acceptable  control  limits  established  for  an  instrument,
the laser power may be adjusted to compensate for drift
in   the   optical   transfer   efficiency   of   the   sample
excitation  subsystem.    If  the  source  of  drift  cannot  be
ascribed    to    this    simple    mechanism,    thoroughly
investigate   and   correct   the   problem.      Instrument
recalibration may be required.

TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING WARP ON SILICON WAFERS BY
AUTOMATED NON-CONTACT SCANNING
This  test  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the North American Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org

September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.    Original  edition  published  by  ASTM  International  as
ASTM F 1390-92.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1390-0704.
1 Purpose
1. 1 Warp    can    significantly    affect    the    yield    of
semiconductor device processing.
1. 2 Knowledge   of   this   characteristic   can   help   the
producer  and  consumer  determine  if  the  dimensional
characteristics   of   a   specimen   wafer   satisfy   given
geometrical requirements.
1. 3 Changes   in   wafer   warp   during   processing   can
adversely  affect  subsequent  handling  and  processing
steps.    These  changes  can  also  provide  an  important
process monitoring function.
1. 4 This test method is suitable for measuring the warp
of  wafers  used  in  semiconductor  device  processing  in
the as-sliced, lapped, etched, polished, epitaxial or other
layer   condition   and   for   monitoring   thermal   and
mechanical effects on the warp of wafers during device
processing.
2 Scope
2. 1 This    test    method    covers    a    non-contacting,
nondestructive   procedure   to   determine   the   warp   of
clean, dry semiconductor wafers.
2. 2 This  test  method  employs  a  two-probe  system  that
examines    both    external    surfaces    of    the    wafer
simultaneously.
2. 3 The  test  method  is  applicable  to  wafers  50  mm  or
larger  in  diameter,  and  approximately  100  μm  and
larger  in  thickness,  independent  of  thickness  variation
and surface finish, and of gravitationally induced wafer
distortion.
2. 4 This  test  method  is  not  intended  to  measure  the
flatness  of  either  exposed  silicon  surface.    Warp  is  a
measure  of  the  distortion  of  the  median  surface  of  the
wafer.
2. 5 This   test   method   measures   warp   of   a   wafer
corrected for mechanical forces applied during the test.
Therefore,     the     procedure     described     gives     the
unconstrained value of warp.
NOTE 1:  This     warp     is     indicated     by     the     acronym
“GMLYMER” in Appendix 2, Shape Decision Tree, of SEMI
M1.
NOTE 2:  SEMI MF657 measures median surface warp using
a  three-point  back-surface  reference  plane.    The  back-surface
reference  results  in  thickness  variation  being  included  in  the
recorded  warp  value.    The  use  (in  this  test  method)  of  a
median surface reference plane eliminates this effect.  The use
(in  this  test  method)  of  a  least-squares  fit  reference  plane
reduces   the   variability   introduced   in   three-point   plane
calculations by choice of reference point location.  The use (in
this   test   method)   of   special   calibration   or   compensating
techniques minimizes the effects of gravity-induced distortion
of the wafer.
2. 6 This   test   method   includes   several   methods   for
canceling    gravity-induced    deflection    which    could
otherwise alter the shape of the wafer.

NOTE 3:  One  of  these  methods,  the  Representative  Wafer
Inversion  Method,  is  covered  by  a  patent  held  by  ADE
Corporation, 80 Wilson Way, Westwood, MA  02090-1806.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3 Limitations
3. 1 Any relative motion along the probe measuring axis
between the probes and the wafer holding device during
scanning  will  produce  error  in  the  measurement  data.
Vibration  of  the  test  specimen  relative  to  the  probe-
measuring  axis  will  introduce  error.    Such  errors  are
minimized  by  system  signature  analysis  and  correction
algorithms.    Internal  system  monitoring  may  also  be
used  to  correct  non-repetitive  and  repetitive  system
mechanical   translations.      Failure   to   provide   such
corrections may cause errors.
3. 2 If    a    measured    wafer    differs    substantially    in
diameter,   thickness,   fiducials,   or   crystal   orientation
from   that   used   for   the   gravitational   compensation
procedure,  the  results  may  be  incorrect.    Estimates  of
the  errors  in  gravity  induced  deflection  for  differences

Measurements,” NIST/ASTM/SEMI/SEMATECH  Technology  Confe-

Characterization, February 1, 1990.


SEMI MF1390-1104 © SEMI 2004 2
in   diameter   and   thickness   are   shown   in   Related
Information  1.    If  the  crystal  orientation  of  the  sample
to  be  measured  differs  from  the  crystal  orientation  of
the   gravity-compensation   wafer,   then   the   measured
warp value may differ from the actual warp value by up
to  15%.    Error  tables  for  fiducial  variation  have  not
been generated.
3. 3 Different  methods  for  implementing  gravitational
compensation   may   give   different   results.      Varying
levels  of  completeness  of  implementing  a  method  may
also give different results.
3. 4 Mechanical   variations   in   wafer   holding   devices
between     systems     may     introduce     measurement
differences.    This  test  method  allows  the  use  of  a
variety  of  wafer  holding  devices  (see  Section  7.1.4.1);
results      obtained      with      different      geometrical
configurations of wafer holding device on the same test
samples may differ.
3. 5 Most     equipment     systems     capable     of     this
measurement  have  a  definite  range  of  wafer  thickness
combined   with   warp   (dynamic   range)   that   can   be
accommodated  without  readjustment.    If  the  sample
moves   outside   this   dynamic   range   during   either
calibration or measurement, results may be in error.  An
over-range  signal  can  be  used  to  alert  the  operator  and
measurement data examiners to this event.
3. 6 The  quantity  of  data  points  and  their  spacing  may
affect  the  measurement  results.    This  test  method  does
not specify the data point spacing (see Section 7.1.4.2);
results  obtained  with  different  data  point  spacings  on
the same test samples may differ.

5 Terminology
5. 1 Definitions
5. 1.1  mechanical  signature,  of  an  instrument  —  that
component  of  a  measurement  that  is  introduced  by  the
instrument   and   that   is   systematic,   repeatable,   and
quantifiable.
5. 1.2  median surface, of a semiconductor wafer — the
locus  of  points  equidistant  from  the  front  and  back
surfaces of the wafer.
5. 1.3  reference  plane,  of  a  semiconductor  wafer  —  a
plane  from  which  deviations  of  a  specified  surface  of
the wafer are measured.
5. 1.4  reference  plane  deviation  (RPD)  —  the  distance
from  a  point  on  a  reference  plane  to  the  corresponding
point on a wafer surface.
5. 1.4.1 Discussion    —    A    dome-shaped    wafer    is
considered  to  have  positive  RPD  at  its  center;  a  bowl-
shaped wafer is considered to have negative RPD at its
center.
5. 1.5  thickness,   of   a   semiconductor   wafer   —   the
distance   through   the   wafer   between   corresponding
points on the front and back surfaces.
5. 1.6  warp,  of  a  semiconductor  wafer  —  the  algebraic
difference  between  the  most  positive  and  the  most
negative  deviations  of  the  median  surface  of  a  wafer
that is not chucked from a reference plane that is a least
squares fit to the median surface.
5. 1.6.1 Discussion — Although warp may be caused by
unequal  stresses  on  the  two  exposed  surfaces  of  the
wafer,  it  cannot  be  determined  from  measurements  on
a  single  exposed  surface.    The  median  surface  may
contain regions with upward or downward curvature or
both; under some conditions the median surface may be
flat.    In  all  cases,  warp  is  a  zero  or  positive  quantity.
Stylized examples of visualization of warp are shown in
SEMI MF657.

technology can be found in SEMI MF1241.
6 Summary of Test Method
6. 1 A  calibration  procedure  is  performed  to  set  the
instrument's  scale  factor  and  other  constants.  If  the
representative   wafer   inversion   method   is   used   for
gravity   correction,   the   calibration   procedure   also
determines  the  mechanical  signature  of  the  instrument
and the effect of gravity on the wafer.


SEMI MF1390-1104 © SEMI 2004 3
6. 2 The  wafer  is  supported  by  a  small-area  chuck  with
front surface up.
6. 3 Both  external  surfaces  are  simultaneously  scanned
along a prescribed pattern by an opposed pair of probes
to  obtain  a  set  of  values  of  the  distances  between  each
surface  and  the  nearest  probe.    In  each  case,  both
members  of  the  pair  of  distances  is  taken  at  the  same
value of the x and y coordinates.
6. 4 The   paired   displacement   values   are   used   to
construct the median surface.
6. 5 A  correction  for  gravity  effects  on  the  median
surface   is   made   either   by   subtracting   a   gravity
correction   obtained   (1)   from   measurements   on   a
representative     wafer     or     (2)     from     theoretical
considerations  or  by  repeating  the  scan  with  the  wafer
inverted.
6. 6 A  least-squares  reference  plane  is  constructed  from
the corrected median surface.
6. 7 The reference plane deviation (RPD) is calculated at
each measured pair of points.
6. 8 Warp   is   reported   as   the   algebraic   difference
between  the  most  positive  RPD  and  the  most  negative
RPD.

7. 1.4.3.7  Measuring  equipment  employing  either  the
Representative  Wafer  Inversion  Method  or  the  Sample
Wafer Inversion Method for gravity compensation must
provide   precise   positioning   in   both   measurement
orientations so that measurements are taken at identical
locations for each orientation of the sample.
8 Materials
8. 1 Set-up     Masters     —     suitable     to     accomplish
calibration and standardization as recommended by the
equipment manufacturer.
8. 2 Reference  Wafer  —  with  a  reference  warp  value
≤20 μm that is used to determine the level of agreement


SEMI MF1390-1104 © SEMI 2004 4
between  the  warp  value  obtained  by  the  measuring
equipment under test and the reference warp value (see
Section 9).
8. 3 Representative   Wafer   —   required   only   if   the
Representative Wafer Inversion Method is used for the
gravity  correction.    A  representative  wafer  shall  be
identical   in   nominal   diameter,   nominal   thickness,
fiducials,   composition   and   crystalline   orientation   to
those being measured.  Its warp need not be known.
9 Suitability of Measuring Equipment
9. 1 Determine    the    suitability    of    the    measuring
equipment  with  the  use  of  a  reference  wafer  and  its
reference        warp    value    in    accordance    with    the
procedures  of  Sub-section  9.2,  or  by  performance  of  a
statistically-based   instrument   repeatability   study   to
ascertain whether the equipment is operating within the
manufacturer's stated specification for repeatability.
9. 1.1  The    reference  warp  value  is  the  average  of  a
number of values obtained for that wafer over a number
of   “passes”   (repeat   measurements).      The   reference
wafer  is  measured  on  the  measuring  equipment  under
test  and  its  reference  warp  value  is  compared  against
the  measured  warp  value.    The  acceptable  level  of  the
agreement  between  the  reference  and  measured  warp
values is to be agreed upon by the parties to the test.
9. 2 Procedure
9. 2.1  Select  a  reference  wafer  of  appropriate  criteria,
together with its associated reference warp value.
9. 2.2  Measure  the  reference  wafer  on  the  measuring
equipment under test to obtain a sample warp value.
9. 2.3  Subtract   the   two   warp   values   to   obtain   the
difference:

samplereferencewarp
WarpWarp−=∆
(1)
9. 2.4  The  metric  to  be  used  to  determine  acceptability
is difference,
∆
warp.
Accept the measuring equipment as
suitable for use if this difference is less than a value that
is agreed upon between the parties to the test.
NOTE 4:  If   the   measuring   equipment   is   to   be   used   to
measure  other  parameters,  such  as  flatness  and  thickness
variation  in  addition  to  warp,  the  reference  and  sample  warp
values may be included in the reference and sample data sets
specified  in  SEMI  MF1530,  but  this  is  not  necessary  if  only
warp measurements are to be made.
10 Sampling
10. 1 This  test  method  is  nondestructive  and  may  be
used  on  either  100%  of  the  wafers  in  a  lot  or  on  a
sampling basis.
10. 1.1  If   samples   are   to   be   taken,   procedures   for
selecting the sample from each lot of wafers to be tested
shall  be  agreed  upon  between  the  parties  to  the  test,  as
shall the definition of what constitutes a lot.
11 Calibration and Standardization
11. 1 Calibrate  the  measuring  equipment  in  accordance
with the manufacturer's instructions.
11. 2 When  using  the  Representative  Wafer  Inversion
Method  for  correcting  the  gravity-induced  deflection,
determine z
gravity
,  the  deflection  due  to  gravity  and
machine    effects    on    the    representative    wafer,    in
accordance  with  Section  12  and  Section  13  through
paragraph 13.7.
12 Procedure
12. 1 Prepare  the  apparatus  for  measurement  of  wafers,
including  selection  of  diameter,  peripheral  fiducials,
scan area and data display/output functions.  Also select
the  gravitational  correction  method  from  one  of  the
following:
• Reference Wafer Inversion Method (see Note 3),
• Sample Wafer Inversion Method, or
• Theoretical Modeling Method.
12. 2 Select  the  fixed  quality  area  (FQA)  by  specifying
the nominal edge exclusion (EE).
12. 3 Introduce  the  test  specimen  into  the  measurement
mechanism  with  the  front  surface  upward  and  initiate
the measurement sequence to determine and record the
distances  between  each  probe  and  the  nearest  wafer
surface in pairs, a and b, at each measurement position.
Proceed  directly  to  Section  13  unless  (1)  the  Sample
Wafer  Inversion  Method  is  being  used  to  correct  for
effects    of    distortion    due    to    gravity    or    (2)    a
representative  wafer  is  being  measured  to  obtain  the
gravity  correction  for  use  in  the  Representative  Wafer
Inversion Method (see Note 3).
12. 4 Repeat Section 12.2 with the wafer inverted (front
surface downward).
13 Calculations
13. 1 The     following     calculations     are     performed
automatically  within  the  instrument.    An  outline  of  the
calculation  structures  is  provided  here  to  indicate  the
nature of the procedure.
13. 2 Determine  the  displacements  (distances)  between
each  probe  and  the  nearest  surface  of  the  wafer  (in
pairs) at intervals along the scan pattern.


SEMI MF1390-1104 © SEMI 2004 5
NOTE 5:  From  Figure  1,  note  that  the  distance  between
Probe A  and  the  nearest  surface  of  the  wafer  is  displacement
value a  and  the  distance  between  Probe  B  and  the  nearest
surface of the wafer is displacement value b.
13. 3 Set the origin of the z-axis at the midpoint between
the two probes, A and B.

t        =        wafer        thickness.
13. 5 For measurements in the normal orientation (front

not  only  with  first-order  gravitational  effects,  but  also  with
other  effects  that  may  influence  the  measured  value,  such  as
wafer-periphery effects, some machine-specific signature, etc.
13. 8.2  Sample  Wafer  Inversion  Method  —  Subtract

13. 9 Construct  a  reference  plane  that  is  a  least-squares
fit to the gravity-compensated median surface data at all

15 Precision
15. 1 Twenty-three    200    mm    diameter,    single-side
polished silicon wafers were employed in a round-robin
experiment.    These  wafers  represented  three  different
manufacturing  processes.    All  three  subsets  were  bare
on  the  front  surface.    Two  subsets  were  bare  on  the
back  surface  and  one  subset  had  oxide  on  the  back
surface.
15. 2 Eight  laboratories  measured  warp.    Warp  value
ranges  for  these  three  subsets  are  shown  in  Table  1.
Each  of  the  twenty-three  wafers  was  measured  three
times    in    succession    (in    three    cassette-to-cassette
“passes”),  on  a  single  day  on  automatic  measurement
systems in accordance with this test method.
15. 3 All  measurement  data  were  acquired  with  3  mm
nominal edge exclusion.
15. 4 The    number    of    laboratories,    samples,    and
determinations    in    this    study    met    the    minimum
requirements  for  determining  precision  prescribed  in
ASTM Practice E 691.
15. 5 The  ranges  of  95%  confidence  interval,  within
which two measurements are considered statistically to
be  the  same,  for  within-laboratory  repeatability  (r)  and
between-laboratory  reproducibility  (R)  are  shown  in
Table 1.

TEST METHOD FOR SUBSTITUTIONAL ATOMIC CARBON CONTENT
OF SILICON BY INFRARED ABSORPTION
This  test  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the North American Regional Standards Committee on March 14, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org

May 2004; to be published July 2004.  Original edition published by ASTM International as ASTM F 1389-

# 92

92.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1389-00.
1  Purpose
1. 1   Carbon   may   have   an   important   role   in   defect
formation processes.  Some laboratories have attributed
carbon  as  being  involved  in  the  formation  of  swirl.
Carbon  has  also  been  shown  to  serve  as  a  nucleation
center for the precipitation of oxygen.
1. 2 Although electrically inactive, substitutional carbon
causes stress that can be observed by X-ray topography.
1. 3  Direct  effects  on  the  reverse  bias  characteristics  of
power   devices   and   annealing   problems   in   neutron
transmutation  doped  silicon  have  been  associated  with
carbon.
1. 4  This  test  method  has  applicability  in  production
control,   materials   research,   quality   assurance,   and
materials acceptance.
2  Scope
2. 1  This  referee  test  method
1
covers  the  determination
of  substitutional  carbon  concentration  in  single  crystal
silicon.    Because  carbon  may  also  reside  in  interstitial
lattice  positions  when  in  concentrations  near  the  solid
solubility  limit,  the  results  of  this  test  method  may  not
be  a  measure  of  the  total  carbon  concentration  at  such
concentrations.
2. 2     The     useful     range     of     carbon     concentration
measurable  by  this  test  method  is  from  the  maximum
amount of substitutional carbon soluble in silicon down
to  about  0.1  parts  per  million  atomic  (ppma),  that  is,

1 This test method was developed in cooperation with the Silicon
Technologies Committee of the Japan Electronics and Information
Technology Industries Association (JEITA).  It is essentially
equivalent to JEITA EM-9503, Standard Test Method for
Substitutional Atomic Carbon Content of Silicon by Infrared
Absorption, which is available from JEITA, 3rd floor, Mitsui

50438/2, Testing of Inorganic Semiconductor Materials:
Determination of the Impurity Content in Silicon by Means of
Infrared Absorption; Carbon, is also a method for measuring the
substitutional carbon content of silicon.  It differs in some aspects,
including different conversion coefficients, from this test method.  It
is available from Beuth Verlag GmbH, Burggrafenstrasse 4-10, D-

and down  to about 0.01 ppma, that is, 0.5 ◊ 10

at cryogenic temperatures (below 80 K).
2. 3 This  test  method  utilizes  the  relationship  between
carbon  concentration  and  the  absorption  coefficient  of
the     infrared     absorption     band     associated     with
substitutional  carbon  in  silicon.    At  room  temperatures
(about 300 K), the absorption band peak is at 605 cm
−1

or 16.53 μm.  At cryogenic temperatures (below 80 K),
the absorption band peak is at 607.5 cm
−1
or 16.46 μm.
2. 4  This  test  method  is  applicable  to  slices  of  silicon
with  resistivity  higher  than  3  Ω∑cm  for  p-type  and
higher  than  1  Ω∑cm  for  n-type.  Slices  can  be  any
crystallographic  orientation  and  should  be  polished  on
both surfaces.
2. 5   This   test   method   is   intended   to   be   used   with
infrared   spectrophotometers   that   are   equipped   to
operate  in  the  region  from  2000  to  500  cm
−1
(5  to  20
μm).
2. 6 This test method provides procedure and calculation
sections for the cases where thickness values of test and
reference  specimens  are  both  closely  and  not  closely
matched.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  guides  and  determine  the
applicability  of  regulatory  or  other  limitations  prior  to
use.
3  Limitations
3. 1 Stray light that reaches the detector tends to reduce
the calculated absorbance value and thereby reduces the
reported carbon concentration.
3. 2  The  carbon  level  of  the  reference  slice  should  be
less  than  2  ◊  10
15
atoms/cm

(0.04  ppma)  to  minimize
the   comparative   error   at   room   temperature.      The
detection limit at cryogenic temperatures (below 80 K)
is about 0.01 ppma.  Obtaining reference samples much
below  0.01  ppma  in  carbon  content  may  prove  to  be
difficult.      Therefore   the   measurement   of   very   low
carbon  content  silicon  near  the  0.01  ppma  detection
limit is necessarily a comparative measurement only.

3. 3 Spectrophotometer    technique    is    critical    to    a
successful  carbon  determination.    The  manufacturer's
instrument  instruction  manuals  should  be  studied  to
familiarize  the  operator  with  the  proper  use  of  the
spectrometer.    Since  the  transmittance  at  the  carbon
peak  can  be  very  low,  while  the  transmittance  at  the
baseline    regions    is    about    40%,    extremely    good
photometric linearity is critical.  Wavenumber precision
is  also  critical  because  the  carbon  peak  lies  on  the
shoulder of a very intense lattice absorption band.
3. 4 The FWHM of the carbon absorption band at room
temperature  must  be  less  than  6  cm
−1
for  acceptable
measurements.    At  cryogenic  temperatures  (below  80
K),   it   must   be   less   than   3   cm
−1
for   acceptable
measurements.      Excessive   width   may   be   due   to
improper  thickness  matching,  to  stress,  or  to  the  use  of
a low resolution setting of the instrument.  In dispersive
instruments,   excessive   widths   can   also   result   from
incorrect  instrument  balance  setting  or  too  fast  a  scan
speed.    In  Fourier  transform  instruments,  excessive
widths  can  result  from  the  use  of  a  source-defining
aperture that is too wide.
3. 5  Specimens  that  do  not  exceed  the  instrument  beam
size  cause  error.    Use  of  apertures  at  the  sample,  or
preferably  beam  condensers  to  reduce  the  beam  size  at
the sample, can correct this problem.
3. 6  The  main  two-phonon  lattice  band  of  silicon,  at
about 610 cm
−1
(16 μm), is very intense; the absorption
coefficient  for  this  band  is  about  9  cm
−1
at  room
temperature,  and  about  5  cm
−1
at  78  K.
2
This  broad
band  peak  is  close  to  the  wavelength  of  the  carbon-in-
silicon band and so presents a problem in measuring the
intensity of the carbon band.
3. 7   Reference   and   test   slices   must   be   as   close   as
practically  possible  to  the  same  temperature  to  avoid
the effects of temperature on the intensity of the lattice
band.
3. 8  The  minimum  detection  level  of  this  test  method  is
limited  by  the  signal-to-noise  ratio  of  the  spectrum.
Thus  attaining  the  highest  possible  sensitivity  by  this
test method requires long measurement times and stable
spectrophotometers.
3. 9  Free  carrier  absorption  in  silicon  specimens  with
resistivities  less  than  3  Ω∑cm  for  p-type,  or  1  Ω∑cm for
n-type,  reduces  the  available  energy  below  the  level
required     for     satisfactory     operation     of     most
spectrophotometers.
3. 10  For  samples  at  cryogenic  temperatures  (below  80
K),   plane   parallel,   polished   surfaces   may   cause
interference  fringes  on  the  spectrum.    Increasing  the

sample thickness or inducing a wedge (non-flatness) in
the sample reduces these interference fringes.

measured by the detector as a function of retardation in
the interferometer.  This interferogram is then subjected
to  a  Fourier  transformation  to  obtain  an  amplitude-
wavenumber    (or    wavelength)    spectrum.        FT-IR
instruments  are  always  used  in  conjunction  with  a
computer   to   control   the   interferometer,   collect   and
manipulate the data, and for spectral output.
