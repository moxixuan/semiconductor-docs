SEMI G84-0303 © SEMI 2001, 20039 11.1.1 A typical equipment scenario is that for eachstrip arriving at the equipment input, a strip map request(S14,F1) and subsequent download (S14,F2) willoccur. See Figure 1. Depending on the equipment type,there may be some variations on the optional attributesrequested, the timing of events and exception handling.11.2 Strip Map Creation11.2.1 A map must exist before it can be sent to anequipment type. Some equipment may be required tosupport the creating of the map for the first time. SeeFigure 2. For these equipment two modes areidentified, autocreate and user confirm. To usethese modes the equipment shall behave as indicatedbelow.11.2.2 If equipment supports an autocreate mode theequipment will process the strip as normal when a newstrip arrives. The equipment will assume each locationon the strip has an unknown status. Should the equipment be required to send a strip map duringprocessing due to equipment errors, the strip map shallcontain the unknown CellStatus value whenever thestatus is unknown. All other CellStatus indicators shallbe Good or Bad. See Upload scenario.11.2.3 If equipment supports a user confirm mode,the equipment shall request operator intervention todecide how to deal with a missing strip map. Theoptions are Create map or Abort. If the operatorselects Create map the above scenario will be valid.If the operator selects Abort, the equipment shallsend an alarm to the host and not process the strip. Thestrip will not be processed unless the equipment isremoved from the strip map mode.11.3 Strip Map Upload11.3.1 For equipment with the capability of detectingdefective units on a strip, a strip map upload is required.The upload will report new definitions of each cell. Event Report AcknowledgeS6,F12 Strip map is checkedfor conflicts and whenOK is stored in stripmap server.

SEMI G84-0303 © SEMI 2001, 2003 12 APPENDIX 1STRIP MAP NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI G84 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures onAugust 27, 2001.A1-1 This appendix shows how the map data items may be applied to strips as well as some additional informationspecific to this substrate type.A1-2 The StripID shall follow the SEMI T9 specification, when applicable, or may be user definable by the factory.A1-3 For any given process there must be a way to ensure correct orientation of the strip. The end user isresponsible for providing a master manufacturing drawing showing the top side of the strip. This drawing must showany special markings or patterns that are needed to reliably flip and rotate a physical strip until it is oriented thesame as the drawing. Figure A1-1 defines what is meant by top side and hence bottom side. It also defines what ismeant by upper, lower and left and right.A1-4 Each strip type will have a factory defined value for OriginLocation. This is the origin reference for the row 1,column 1 location on the strip. The factory origin, OriginLocation is selected as one of four corners by the factoryhost system. The row and column index will be referenced from the selected reference. This information will beprovided to the equipment by the host in each strip map download scenario.1 = Upper right (UR) top side2 = Upper left (UL) top side3 = Lower left (LL) top side4 = Lower right (LR) top side6 = Upper right (UR) bottom side7 = Upper left (UL) bottom side8 = Lower left (LL) bottom side9 = Lower right (LR) bottom side Row Row Column Row RowColumn Column Column Std Process Direction 12 3 4Top Side Row Row Column Row RowColumn Column Column Std Process Direction 67 8 9Bottom Side Figure A1-1Factory Origin Settings NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standard set forth herein for anyparticular application.

It givesdevelopers the power to deliver structured data from awide variety of applications to the desktop for localcomputation and presentation. XML allows the creationof unique data formats for specific applications. It isalso an ideal format for server-to-server transfer ofstructured data.7.2 XML consists of elements (referred to as items inthe remainder of this document) that may haveattributes and nested items.7.2.1 Example: defines a Map item with the attribute xmlns:http://www.semi.org which defines a namespace andthe governing body for that namespace. This is inaccordance with the Namespaces in XMLspecification (see references). Specifying thenamespace ensures that the names within the Mapelement are distinguishable from the same names inother non-SEMI XML documents.7.2.2 The Map item contains nested items calledDevice.7.3 The listing below is an example of a well-formedmap data file for a single map with all the map dataitems. A map supplier may insert their own elements

The elementsof this template will be described in the sections thatfollow. Examples of map data files with data areshown in the appendices. 7.3.1 The order of attributes and sub items within theirparent item is not significant but the parent childrelationship is. One exception is the Row items whichmust match the actual rows on the substrate beingmapped.7.4 Every map file starts with the declaration: This line informs the parser that the data that followsconforms to the XML Version 1.0 specification.7.5 The data for each wafer is enclosed within the mapdata item: 7.5.1 The attribute setting, xmlns: http://www.semi.org informs the parser that the item and attributenames within this item are unique within the namespaceidentified as SEMI.7.5.2 All the attributes within the Map item are definedin the SEMI G81.7.5.3 All the items within the Map Item are defined inthis document.7.5.4 Some of these attributes and items are mandatoryand some are optional as defined in Table 1.7.5.5 One or more maps can be represented in a singlefile by simply repeating the element. Each mapcan be distinguished based on an identifier attribute asshown in the following example: 7.6 The Map item contains one or more Device items.This allows multiple overlaying maps of differentdevice types to be represented. The Device itemcontains a number of attributes and some sub items.7.6.1 The ReferenceDevice item contains attributeswhich describe a single reference device. SeveralReferenceDevice items may be represented byrepeating this item with different attribute values.7.6.2 The Bin item contains attributes which describe asingle bin code. Several Bin items may be representedby repeating this item with different attribute values.7.6.3 The Data item contains attributes and a list ofRow items.

SEMI C1-0705 © SEMI 1978, 20051 SEMI C1-0705GUIDE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF LIQUID CHEMICALS This guide was technically approved by the global Liquid Chemicals Committee. This edition was approvedfor publication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on April 7, 2005. It was available atwww.semi.org in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005. Originally published in 1978; previouslypublished July 2004. 1 Purpose1.1 Liquid Chemicals are used extensively during the production of semiconductor devices; their purity has beenshown to affect the device yield during the manufacturing processes.1.2 Since there is a wide range of semiconductor devices being produced, different levels of purity have beenestablished as standards and guidelines for each liquid chemical.1.3 This guide describes the various analytical procedures for standards verification procedures required to meet aspecific liquid chemical specification. 2 Scope2.1 All liquid chemical standards consist of guidelines, specifications and validated analytical procedures. Suitableanalytical procedures are defined in each standard for each grade of liquid chemical such that their sensitivity meetsthe requirements of each of the respective grades of liquid chemicals.2.2 This guide provides an overview of each of the methods used for liquid chemical certification. Each grade ofliquid chemicals (15) that have been validated analytically using the appropriate procedures described in this guidecan be described as meeting SEMI specifications.2.3 Analytical Procedures  The procedures used to establish a liquid chemical specification can be found in 7.The Analytical Procedures are listed in Table 1.2.4 Safety  Because of the continuing evolution of safety precautions, it is impossible for this publication toprovide definite statements related to the safe handling of individual liquid chemicals. The user is referred toproduct labels, product data sheets, government regulations, and other relevant literature.NOTICE: This guide does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this guide to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.Table 1 Analytical Procedures7.1 Acidity and Alkalinity7.2 Assay by Wide Bore Column Gas Chromatography7.3 Color7.4 Residue after Evaporation7.5 Residue after Ignition7.6 Trace Arsenic (and Antimony) Determination7.7 Use of a pH Meter7.8 Ion Chromatography7.9 Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS)7.10 Flame Emission Spectrometry7.11 Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GFAAS)7.12 Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES)7.13 Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)7.14 Calibration and Measurement Method for Particles in Liquids

Where a dilution is performed to a stated volume or a stated volume of a solution is taken, thatvolume shall be within 2.0% of the stated amount.4.3 Acidity and Alkalinity  A test for acidity or alkalinity, or both, of liquid chemicals may be specified. (SeeAcidity and Alkalinity in 7.1.)4.4 Analytical Blank  Where a blank is specified to be run, unless otherwise stated, it shall be performed withthe same quantities of the same reagents and in a manner identical to that followed with the sample portion undertest, but with the material itself omitted.4.5 Apparatus  Apparatus, unless otherwise qualified, shall be that commonly employed in the conduct of therelevant test.4.6 Atomic and Formula Weights  Atomic weights (i.e. atomic masses) used shall be those of the latestpublication of The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)3. Formula weights shall becalculated from a given empirical (molecular) formula by addition of the stated multiples of the atomic weights.Unless otherwise stated, formula weights shall be rounded to 2 significant figures to the right of the decimal point(see Rounding of Numbers, 4.17).4.7 Comparison of Analytical Results with Specification Limits  In the comparison of an analytical result for a testwith the numerical limit associated with the specification, the result shall be rounded to the number of significantfigures indicated for that limit. (See Rounding of Numbers, 4.17.) Consequently, a specification stated at 96%minimum will be met by a result as small as 95.5%, and that stated as 96.0% minimum will be met by a result assmall as 95.95%. A specification of 0.1% maximum will be met by a result as large as 0.149%, and that of 0.10%maximum by a result as large as 0.105%. In those specifications given with no digit following the decimal point,such as 10 ng/mL maximum, a test result as large as 10.5 ng/mL will meet the specification. This use of a decimalpoint is made to clarify the difference between converting 0.01 mg/mL to 10 ng/mL and converting 0.010 mg/mL to10. ng/mL. 4 4.8 Density  The density of a liquid shall be determined for the compound in air at 25°C and be expressed ingrams/milliliter (g/mL). Where the specific gravity, with respect to water, is determined, it shall be expressed asdensity by the use of tabular values for the density of water at the relevant temperature(s).4.9 Desiccator  A desiccator shall imply a tightly closed container charged with a suitable desiccant (commonlycalcium chloride or sulfate) that allows an atmosphere of low humidity to be maintained. 1 American Society for Testing and Materials, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-2959, USA.

SEMI C1-0705 © SEMI 1978, 20053 4.10 Drying or Igniting to Constant Weight  A statement dried to a constant weight or ignited to a constantweight shall imply that two separate weighings differ by no more than ± 0.4 mg (unless otherwise specified), wherethe second weighing follows a second drying (for one hour (unless otherwise stated) or ignition for 15 minutes(unless otherwise stated), respectively.4.11 Expression of Content and Concentration  Unless otherwise stated, a specification limit and experimentalresults related to it shall be expressed in units of weight by weight. The concentration of a solution of a test reagentshall be expressed either in molarity or normality or as percent weight by volume. A redox normality value shallalways be followed, parenthetically, by the relevant molarity. In the approximate dilution of reagents, aparenthetical expression of two numbers with an intervening plus sign shall imply that the relative volume of thestated reagent given by the first number shall be admixed with the relative volume of water given by the secondnumber. Thus, dilute sulfuric acid (1 + 3) directs that one volume of reagent grade sulfuric acid be added to 3volumes of water and the mixture stirred to form a uniform solution.4.12 Filtration  A statement to filter, unless qualified, shall imply filtration through suitable filter paper untilthe filtrate is clear.4.13 Physical Properties  Physical properties shall not usually be employed for specification purposes; forinformation, however, representative values for a particular liquid chemical, as supplied, may be included in thestandard for that liquid chemical. Where relevant, physical properties shall be specified for 25°C.4.14 Reagent Chemicals  Unless otherwise stated, reagents to be used in tests shall conform to the minimumstandards of quality set forth in the current edition of Reagent Chemicals, published by the American ChemicalSociety5.4.15 Residue after Evaporation  A residue after evaporation test may be used in the assessment of liquidchemicals. (See Determination of Residue after Evaporation, 7.4.)4.16 Residue after Ignition  A residue after ignition test serves to assess the amount of nonvolatile inorganicmatter present in a sample. (See Determination of Residue after Ignition, 7.5.)4.17 Rounding of Numbers  The following rules for rounding of measured or calculated values shall beemployed:4.17.1 When the figure next beyond the last place to be retained is less than 5, leave unchanged the figure in the lastplace retained.4.17.2 When the figure next beyond the last place to be retained is greater than 5, increase by 1 the figure in the lastplace retained.4.17.3 When the figure next beyond the last place to be retained is 5 and there are no figures beyond this 5 or onlyzeroes, (a) increase by 1 the figure in the last place retained if it is odd, or leave the figure unchanged if it is even.4.17.4 When the figure next beyond the last place to be retained is 5 and there are figures other than zeroes beyondthis 5 increase by 1 the figure in the last place retained.4.17.5 Obtain the rounded value in one step by direct rounding and not in two or more steps of successiveroundings.4.18 Samples and Sampling  For liquid chemicals provided in small containers, one (or more) should be freshlyopened for testing, thereby reducing possibilities for contamination or change in composition (for example, bymoisture pickup). Where the liquid chemical is provided in larger bulk quantities, one or more drums or othercontainers shall be sampled to avoid cross contamination, and the combined sample shall be placed in a labeled,well-cleaned container that shall be tightly closed and transferred expeditiously to the testing laboratory.4.19 Specifications and Specification Limits  The specifications provided by this guide are intended to serve forliquid chemicals to be used in the manufacture and processing of semiconductors and advanced electronic devicesand circuits. The specifications and the associated test procedures are based on the experience of suppliers and usersand also on published studies relating to liquid chemicals of the required quality. The function of the specificationsis to establish minimum standards of quality. 5 Available from American Chemical Society, 1155 Sixteenth Street, NW, Washington DC, 20036, Phone: 202-872-4600, Fax: 202-872-4615,Website: http://www.chemistry.org

SEMI C1-0705 © SEMI 1978, 2005 4 4.19.1 Where feasible, a specification of content shall be expressed as a numerical limit in units of weight byweight. For a specification that cannot be assigned such a limit, the expression To pass test shall be used.4.19.2 For a major component, the value (assay, purity, etc.) shall be expressed as a minimum permissible limit orrange. For an impurity, the value shall be expressed as a maximum permissible limit.4.19.3 A liquid chemical conforming to the specification will commonly contain either more of the majorcomponent than the minimum permissible limit or be within the specified range for the liquid chemicals and containless of each impurity (or impurities) than the maximum permissible limit. In neither case shall the liquid chemicalsbe considered as of higher quality than that defined by the specification.4.19.4 It is manifestly impossible in the specifications and procedures for a liquid chemical to consider everyimpurity or contaminant that might be present. For certain applications, it is recognized that more stringent oradditional specifications and procedures might be required. The intent of these specifications and the associatedprocedures is, on one hand, to assure that a liquid chemical is suitable for the common uses to which it may be put inthe manufacture and processing of semiconductor devices and, on the other hand, to be consistent withcontemporary manufacturing processes for that liquid chemical.4.20 Specification Parameters  The statement of specification parameters for a particular liquid chemical shallbe, as far as practical.4.20.1 Assay or other test assessing the component(s) of interest4.20.2 Appearance or color4.20.3 Acidity or alkalinity, or both, or pH range of solution4.20.4 Residue after evaporation or ignition4.20.5 Water content4.20.6 Diverse general tests, arranged alphabetically4.20.7 Tests for stated anions and ammonium shall be arranged alphabetically (ammonium, chloride, nitrate,phosphate, sulfate)4.20.8 Tests for specific trace metals, arranged alphabetically by name. The 21 metals for grade specificationshigher than Grade 2 are Aluminum, Antimony, Arsenic, Barium, Boron, Cadmium, Calcium, Chromium, Copper,Iron, Lead, Lithium, Magnesium, Manganese, Nickel, Potassium, Sodium, Tin, Titanium, Vanadium, and Zinc.4.20.9 All major words in a specification parameter shall have their initial letters capitalized.4.20.10 Following the statement of a specification parameter, where relevant, the species on which the calculationof the result is based shall be expressed parenthetically as the atomic symbol or empirical formula.4.21 Tared Containers  Where the use of a tared container is specified, it shall be carried through operationsidentical to those used in the test procedures, including drying or ignition, or both, cooling in a desiccator, andweighing. When a new container is placed in service, special measures may be required to assure that it is broughtto constant weight by the operations.4.22 Temperature  Temperature values shall be expressed in degrees Celsius (°C).4.23 Water  References to water in the testing procedures are understood to mean water that is of the appropriategrade for the intended purpose. Depending on the grade of liquid chemical being tested, water meeting therequirements for Types E-1, E-1.1, and E-1.2 water in ASTM Standard Guide D5127 may be used. In tests fornitrogen compounds, water should be ammonia-free or nitrogen-free. For some tests, freshly boiled water mustbe used in order to ensure freedom from material absorbed from the air such as ammonia, carbon dioxide, oroxygen.

Then 0.1 mL of phenolphthalein indicator solution is added and0.01 N sodium hydroxide until a slight pink color persists after shaking for 30 seconds. Next, a stated amount ofsample is added and mixed, and a titration is performed with 0.01 N sodium hydroxide until the pink color isreproduced; the volume of titrant required is recorded.7.1.2 In the alkalinity test, a stated amount of sample is mixed with a stated volume of water (commonly 25 mL).Now 0.05 mL of methyl red indicator solution is added and the mixture is titrated with 0.01 N hydrochloric aciduntil a slight pink color is reached; the volume of titrant required is recorded.7.1.3 The result of such tests has often been expressed qualitatively as passes test or quantitatively as the contentof an acid (or base) known or assumed to be present.

SEMI C1-0705 © SEMI 1978, 200513 7.2 Assay by Wide Bore Column Gas Chromatography  The theory of gas chromatography is given in manydocuments, reviews, etc. The purpose here is to delineate some practical aspects for the assessment of volatileorganic reagents by gas chromatography. A complete detailed procedure for the gas chromatographic assay is notgiven since available instruments vary from laboratory to laboratory. However, the use of wide bore capillarycolumns is recommended to replace conventional packed columns. Capillary columns, constructed of fused silicaonto which is bonded a liquid phase, have greater resolving power and liquid chemical inertness.7.2.1 Equipment  A gas chromatograph equipped with capillary wide bore column adaptors of isothermal andmulti-step linear and temperature-programmed operation is recommended.7.2.2 Sample  Direct flash vaporization or on-column injection of the sample with standard gauge needles can beused with wide bore columns. On column injection can minimize sample degradation while increasing thereproducibility of results. On column injection is ideal to use with very volatile materials such as the reagentsassayed in this guide.7.2.3 Columns  Many types of columns exist and can be used. Until recently, packed columns in which a liquidphase is coated on a porous solid support were extensively used for assay of reagents. The introduction of wide borecapillary columns having an i.d. of typically 530 micrometers and a thick film of liquid phase from 1 to 5micrometers allows a laboratory to use a packed column instrument and conditions, while gaining the advantages ofcapillary technology. Columns can be used either in the high resolution capillary mode (low carrier gas flow rates)to achieve optimum resolution of sample components, or at higher flow rates (2030 mL/min) where they willperform packed column-like separations in a shorter time. Packed columns require a multitude of stationary phasesto accomplish typical separations performed in an analytical laboratory. The increased length of capillary columnsallows for better separation of components so that three columns of low (Type 1, Methyl Silicone), moderate(Type 2, Mixed Cyano, Phenyl, Methyl Silicone), and high (Type 3, Carbowax) polarity can handle the majority ofanalytical requirements. Columns, which have been found acceptable for assay of the reagents in this manual, arelisted in Table 8.Table 8 Columns for Wide Bore Column Gas ChromatographyReagent Recommended#1ColumnAlternate#2ColumnAcetone III II, In-Butyl Acetate I IIDichloromethane I IIMethanol IMethyl Ethyl Ketone I2-Propanol I IIITetrachloroethylene IToluene I IIITrichloroethylene ITrichlorotrifluoroethane IHexamethyldisilizane#3 I1-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone I1,1,1 Trichloroethane IType I Column  Methyl Silicon Bonded PhaseType II Column  Mixed Cyano, Phenyl, Methyl Silicon Bonded PhaseType III Column  Carbowax Bonded Phase#1 Satisfactory for both assay and SEMI-specified impurity determinations.#2 Column will separate all SEMI-specified impurities from assay component. Elution order will differ fromtypical given in individual reagent procedures.#3 Presilanized column recommended. 7.2.4 Conditions  Appropriate conditions will vary from one gas chromatographic system to another. Conditions,which have been found acceptable, are listed under each individual standard. When using packed column in theisothermal mode, the temperature of the column is usually maintained at 10° to 20°C below the boiling point of the

&lt;!-- Page 38 --&gt;

SEMI C1-0705 © SEMI 1978, 2005 14 reagent. The efficient mass transfer associated with wide bore capillary columns may necessitate initial columntemperatures to be more than 20°C below the boiling point of the reagent of interest. Temperature programmingmay be used to improve the shape of eluting peaks and to shorten analysis times. The remaining two heated zones(injector and detector) should be maintained at as low a temperature as possible to lessen thermal decompositioneffects. Typically, for the injector this is 50°C above the boiling point of the material of interest; the detector is held25°C above the highest temperature reached by the column, but never less than 100°C. The split or splitless modeof injection can be used depending on the chromatographic equipment available. The use of a wide bore capillarycolumn simplifies conversion of a packed column to a capillary instrument.7.2.5 Detector  Use of a thermal conductivity detector minimizes the need to correct for detector response todifferences in liquid chemical composition and is usually sufficient for determining reagent assay. To qualify traceimpurities, the more sensitive flame ionization detector is recommended. The detector output, after amplification, isused to produce the chromatogram, a plot of component quantity versus elution time. Modern systems digitize theanalog output, allowing direct printout of peak areas and retention times.7.2.6 Calculation of Results  Results from a chromatogram, used to determine the assay of a reagent, areexpressed in area percent normalized to 100%. A response factor correction for each component is required for themost accurate results, especially when the sample components differ markedly in their detector response. Aninternal standard reduces error due to variations in injection quantities, column, and detector conditions. The use ofcontrol charts, to aid the analyst in visualizing chromatographic variability, is suggested. To verify that assay resultsare valid, use of a system suitability test is recommended.7.3 Color7.3.1 Color (APHA)  For the rapid assessment of colorless liquids for contamination by colored materials,visual comparison with platinum-cobalt solution standards is appropriate, following the methodology of theAmerican Public Health Association (APHA)7 established for the evaluation of the color of water.7.3.2 Preparation of Platinum-Cobalt Stock Solution (APHA No. 500)  Dissolve 1.246 g of reagent gradepotassium chloroplatinate, K2PtCl6, and 1.000 g of cobalt chloride hexahydrate, CoCl2 6H 20, in water. Add 100 mLof reagent grade hydrochloric acid (~37%) and dilute with water to exactly 1,000 mL. Store in a tightly closedbottle.7.3.3 General Procedure for Color (APHA) Test  For the working standard, dilute one or more suitablealiquots of the Platinum-Cobalt Stock Solution (APHA No. 500) with water to 100 mL. In 100 mL Nessler tubes,compare the working standard with an equal volume of the liquid under assessment. View each tube vertically overa white background. The color of the liquid should not exceed the maximum APHA standard value allowed by thespecification for that liquid. On the dilution to 100 mL, aliquots of the stock standard of 1, 2, 3 . . . mL correspondto APHA 5, 10, 15, etc.7.4 Determination of Residue after Evaporation7.4.1 Introduction  The residue after evaporation is defined as the relative amount of residue remaining afterevaporation of a sample of solvent followed by heating of the residue at 105°C for 30 minutes. Drying to constantweight is not utilized since protracted heating may lead to slow volatilization of high-boiling matter.7.4.2 For the determination of the residue after evaporation at the level of 5 parts per million (g/g) or below,determinate errors must be kept extremely small and random errors should be minimized. In the procedure givenbelow, the positive error due to exposure to airborne particulate matter is reduced by the use of the closed systemafforded by the Thiers assembly. Possible negative errors associated with losses caused by transfer of aconcentrated sample or the residue is avoided by effecting the evaporation and weighing in a single dish. Thedeterminate and random errors associated with the weighing operations are reduced by using an aluminum dish formost solvents, weighing on a semi-microbalance, eliminating any static electricity, and conducting all heating andcooling steps in a reproducible manner.7.4.3 Equipment  The Thiers assembly is fashioned from a crystallizing dish. (See Figure 2.) The aluminumdishes of 250 mL capacity are prepared by cutting out a 30 cm circle of aluminum foil, rinsing it with the solvent, 7 American Public Health Association, 800 I Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001, Phone: (202) 777-2742, Fax: (202) 777-2534, Website:http://www.apha.org

The balance is a semi-micro type, and the staticelectricity eliminator may be obtained from supply houses. Figure 3Thiers Assembly7.4.4 Procedure7.4.4.1 Rinse the 250 mL aluminum dish (or platinum dish in the case of halogenated solvents) with a portion of thesample. Heat the dish at 105°C in an oven for 30 min and cool for 30 min (1 hr for platinum) in a desiccatorcharged with calcium chloride and placed near the balance. Discharge static electricity using the eliminator andweigh the dish on a semi-microbalance to the nearest 0.01 mg.7.4.4.2 Start the flow of filtered nitrogen gas through the side arm of the Thiers assembly and place the dish inside.Raise the cover briefly to add the specified amount of solvent from a clean, graduated cylinder. Adjust the nitrogenstream so that the surface of the solvent is barely rippled. Also, adjust the heat lamp and hot plate so that theevaporation rate does not exceed 8 mL/min and that no sample condenses on the top inner surface of the assembly.7.4.4.3 When all of the sample has evaporated, heat the dish for 30 min in an oven at 105°C. Cool as given above,discharge the static electricity, and reweigh. Calculate the residue as mg/mL.\[wt of dish plus residue (g) - wt of dish (g)\]  10 6sample wt (g)For best results, room temperature should be kept constant to ± 5°C.7.5 Residue after Ignition  A residue after ignition test serves to assess the amount of nonvolatile inorganicmatter present in a sample. Unless otherwise stated, the ignition shall be performed at 800° ± 25°C for 15 minutes.Where the addition of sulfuric acid is specified, the result corresponds to what is often termed sulfated ash. Thecalculation of the result, expressed in parts per million (g/g), takes the form: ppm Residue after Ignition = Net weight of residue( ) 10Weight of sample6 7.6 Trace Arsenic (and Antimony) Determination7.6.1 Introduction  This photometric procedure is based upon the color reaction of silver diethyldithiocarbamatewith arsine (and stibine). It provides for measurement of the absorbance of the sample and standards withsubsequent calculation of the arsenic and antimony content of the sample, expressed as arsenic. The proceduregiven below differs from conventional ones by the omission of potassium iodide and stannous chloride. By thisomission, antimony is evolved as stibine and reacts with the silver diethyldithiocarbamate solution. The colordevelopment is consequently due to both arsenic and antimony. The test sensitivity for arsenic is greater than forantimony.

Neutralize with 5 N sulfuric acid, addan excess of 5 mL, dilute to the mark with water, and mix thoroughly.7.6.3.2 Arsenic Working Solution  (1.0 g/mL of arsenic)  Transfer exactly 0.5 mL of the arsenic stock solutionto a 500 mL volumetric flask, and 5 mL of 5 N sulfuric acid, dilute to the mark with water, and mix thoroughly.Prepare immediately before use.7.6.3.3 Lead Acetate Solution  Dissolve 10 g of lead acetate trihydrate in 100 mL of water.7.6.3.4 Silver Diethyldithiocarbamate Solution  Dissolve 1 g of diethyldithiocarbamic acid, silver salt, in 200 mLof pyridine and filter the solution. (The pyridine is best purified by passage through an alumina column.) Store thissolution in a light-resistant container and use within 1 month. Silver diethyldithiocarbamate as a dry solid is yellowin color. Discard material that is markedly off color or develops a strong odor; alternatively, recrystallize from 1:1pyridine-water and dry in vacuo at room temperature.7.6.4 Sample Solution Preparation  Prepare the sample solution as specified in the procedures for the individualliquid chemical.7.6.5 Procedure7.6.5.1 Treat the sample as described in the procedure for the individual chemical and transfer the resulting solutionto the generator flask. Swirl the flask, add 5 mL of 20% sulfuric acid, and allow to stand at room temperature for 15minutes.7.6.5.2 Pack the scrubber tube (c) with two pledgets of lead acetate-impregnated glass wool previously moistenedwith lead acetate solution freed from excess solution by squeezing and dried in a vacuum. Allow a small spacebetween the two pledgets. Place 3.0 mL of silver diethyldithiocarbamate solution in the absorber tube (e), add 3 g ofzinc (granular) to the generator flask (a), and immediately connect the scrubber-absorber assembly to the flask.

(The addition of a small volume of 2-propanol to the generator flask may make the gas evolution moreuniform.) After 45 minutes, disconnect the tubing from the generator flask, transfer the silver diethyldithiocarbamatesolution to a 1 cm photometer cell, and measure the absorbance at 525 nm versus the water blank.7.6.5.4 Carry a water blank and standard through the procedure, using the identical quantities of the same reagents.The standard consists of a volume of the arsenic working solution corresponding to the amount of arsenic stated inthe procedure for the individual liquid chemicals. Any red color in the silver diethyldithiocarbamate solution fromthe sample preparation should be no greater than that obtained with the standard.7.7 Use of a pH Meter  The principles of pH measurement are given in documents and instrument manuals. Thepurpose here is to describe in general terms how the technique is used with the procedures for individual liquidchemicals, either to assure that a pH of Solution specification is met or to adjust the acidity or alkalinity of asolution as required in the conduct of a procedure.7.7.1 Equipment  The pH meter should be capable of reading to 0.02 pH units and should best be equipped fortemperature compensation. The electrodes should be calomel and glass and should be kept in appropriate solutionswhen not in use, following the suppliers recommendations.7.7.2 Standardization  At time of use, the pH meter and electrodes should be standardized against two pHstandard buffers that preferably should bracket the expected pH of the solution to be measured. The meter with theelectrodes immersed in the first buffer should be adjusted to the stated value for that buffer. The electrodes shouldthen be rinsed, and the meter, with the electrodes immersed in the second buffer, should be adjusted to the statedvalue for that buffer. This adjustment procedure should be repeated until two consecutive measurements for one ofthe buffers gives the same value within ± 0.02 pH units. Where a temperature is specified for an individual liquidchemical, either as part of the specification parameter or the relevant procedure, that temperature should bemaintained in the standardization with the corresponding assigned pH values for the pH standard buffers beingemployed. During measurements, each buffer should be magnetically stirred at the same constant rate.7.7.3 Quantitation  For the measurement of the pH of a solution, the meter and electrodes should be standardizedas given above. The electrodes should then be rinsed with water and immersed in the solution (held at the specifiedtemperature), and the pH read once the reading has stabilized. The solution should be magnetically stirred at thesame rate as used in the standardization. If the reading does not stabilize within 1 minute, the cause should be foundand eliminated. Any water used to dilute a sample for the pH of Solution test should be carbon dioxide-free.7.8 Determination of Various Ions by Ion Chromatography  The theory of ion chromatography is given in manydocuments, reviews, etc. The purpose here is to delineate some practical aspects for the determination of variousions by Ion Chromatography. A complete detailed procedure for the ion chromatographic determination is not givensince available instruments vary from laboratory to laboratory.7.8.1 Equipment  An ion chromatograph equipped with ion suppression is recommended. Single column ionchromatography can also be used. The choice of reagents and columns is determined by the ions of interest.7.8.2 Sample  Sample preparation varies depending upon the matrix effects of the liquid chemicals beinganalyzed. Standard sample preparation techniques that may be used are (this list is not all inclusive):7.8.2.1 Evaporation of the reagent to remove the matrix and then diluting the residual with the appropriate grade of18.2 Mohm-cm water that meets ASTM Standard Guide D5127.7.8.2.2 Diluting the reagent with the appropriate grade of 18.2 Mohm-cm water that meets ASTM Standard GuideD5127 to lessen the matrix effects.7.8.2.3 Direct injection of the reagent.7.8.3 Columns  Many types of columns exist and can be used. Typical selection criteria for columns consist ofion or ions of interest, the matrix of the reagent and eluent to be used.7.8.4 Conditions  Appropriate conditions will vary from one ion chromatographic system to another. Analyticalconditions using ion suppression, which have been found acceptable using ion suppression, are listed under eachindividual standard. The two broad classifications of ions are anions and cations. A typical eluent used in theanalysis of anions by ion suppression is a sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate in a solution with theappropriate grade of 18.2 Mohm-cm water that meets ASTM Standard Guide D5127. A typical eluent used in the

&lt;!-- Page 42 --&gt;

SEMI C1-0705 © SEMI 1978, 2005 18 analysis of cations is a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid in a solution with the appropriate grade of 18.2 Mohm-cm water that meets ASTM Standard Guide D5127.7.8.5 Eluent concentration, eluent flow rate, and system pressure are variables, which affect the chromatography.Each must be determined for the chromatographic system being used.7.8.6 Detector  A conductivity detector is used to monitor the changes in the eluent conductivity due to ions inthe sample. An ultraviolet absorbance detector can be used for detection of some ions. The detector output, afteramplification, is used to produce the chromatogram, a plot of component quantity versus elution time. Modernsystems digitize the analog output allowing direct printout of peak heights, peak areas, and retention times.7.8.7 Calculation of ResultsIon Concentration = Pk. Ht.

Calibration linearity must be established before use.7.9 Determination of Trace Elements by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS)  The purpose here is to describein general terms how the technique should be used when specified in the procedures for an individual liquidchemical to assure that the specifications for one or more stated elements are met. No general procedure is givensince operating details will vary with instrument design; consequently, the manufacturers manual should befollowed.7.9.1 Equipment  The source is a hollow cathode lamp, or equivalent, for the relevant element. The burner isslotted and will vary in design and path length according to the gas(es) to be used. The monochromator should havea resolution of at least 0.1 nm. The signal from the detector is read from a meter, digital display, recorder tracing orcustom software. A background correction system should be available.7.9.2 Flame and Burner Conditions  The flame gases to be used are specified in the procedure for the individualliquid chemical. The burner position and gas flow rates should be optimized for a given determination.7.9.3 Solution Conditions  The solutions are prepared as given in the procedures for the individual liquidchemical.7.9.4 Working Standard Solutions  Working standard solutions should be prepared on the day of use by dilutionof a stock standard solution.7.9.5 Quantitation  Commonly, the method of standard addition is employed. It is applicable at lowconcentrations where a linear relationship exists between signal and concentration. By this technique the standardshave a matrix similar to the sample. It is essential that the sample solution, along with the additions, has absorbancein the range for which linearity is expected: routinely, 0.1 to 0.5 absorbance unit. The use of standard additions doesnot eliminate interferences, but assures that the element of interest behaves similarly in the sample preparation andthose with additions. Background correction is usually required, and additives may be called for (see below).7.9.5.1 For specific tests, the signals are measured for five solution preparations: the reagent blank (which may beonly water), the sample solution, and three made by standard additions to the sample solution. The signal for thereagent blank preparation is subtracted from the signals for each of the four other preparations. These four signalsare used graphically or mathematically to determine the content of the element in the sample. Where severalelements are to be determined, they are added simultaneously to the third, fourth, and fifth preparations.Commonly, the additions correspond to one half the specification limit, equal to the limit, and twice the limit.7.9.5.2 A calibration line obtained for aqueous standards can be used if its slope and the slope of the standardaddition line are identical. In that event, liquid chemical (matrix) effects are negligible. (Pk. Ht. S I  Pk. Ht. B I ) (Conc. of Std I )Pk. Ht. Std I  Pk. Ht. B I Dilution Factor

SEMI C1-0705 © SEMI 1978, 200519 7.9.6 Background Correction  Where spurious absorption or other background correction is required, details aregiven in the procedure for an individual liquid chemical. For an element with the stated resonance line in theultraviolet region (&lt;350 nm), the correction should be performed with a deuterium discharge lamp. For an elementwith the stated line in the visible region (&gt;350 nm), the adjacent line technique should be employed. In this method,the background absorption is determined at a wavelength adjacent, ±5 nm, to the line being used for the element ofinterest; that is, it is measured at a wavelength where significant atomic absorption by that element is absent.Zeeman Background correction may also be used.7.9.7 Additives  Where additives are included in the solution preparations, including an ionization suppressant,details are provided in the procedures for the individual liquid chemical.7.9.8 Remarks  The manufacturers manual should be consulted for details on the venting of burner gases and forsafety precautions in the operation of the instrument and burner. The user should check the performance of aninstrument from time to time to assure that adequate sensitivity is being attained for the needs of the particulardetermination.7.10 Determination of Trace Elements by Flame Emission Spectrometry  The purpose here is to describe ingeneral terms how the technique should be used when specified in the procedures for an individual liquid chemicalto assure that the specifications are met for one or more stated elements (commonly sodium or potassium, or both).No general procedure is given since operating details will vary with instrumental design; consequently, themanufacturers manual should be followed.7.10.1 Equipment  The flame photometer should have a monochromator with a resolution of at least 1 nm. Thedetector should have a red-sensitive phototube, a filter to remove the sodium D-line for potassium determinations,and a photomultiplier. (Instruments having a photomultiplier specially sensitive to the potassium line do not need ared-sensitive phototube.) The slit width must be adjustable. A sensitivity control should be available. Also, theburner should have controls for adjusting its position and gas flow rates. The read-out device may be a meter,digital display, or recorder.7.10.2 Flame and Burner Conditions  The flame gases to be used are specified in the procedure for the individualliquid chemical. The burner position and gas flow rates should be optimized for a given determination.7.10.3 Solution Conditions  The solutions are prepared as given in the procedures for the individual liquidchemical.7.10.4 Standards  A stock standard solution for each relevant element should be accurately prepared, usually at aconcentration of 0.1% wt/vol, as given either in the procedure for the individual liquid chemical or in 4. Workingstandard solutions should be prepared on the day of use by dilution of a stock standard solution.7.10.5 Quantitation  Commonly, a single addition of standard is employed. It is applicable at low concentrationwhere a linear relationship exists between signal and concentration. By this technique, the standard has a matrixsimilar to the sample.7.10.5.1 The amount of standard to be added to the sample to make the standard solution is given in the proceduresfor the individual liquid chemical, and corresponds to the specification value of the element being determined.7.10.5.2 For specific tests, the signals are measured for the sample solution and the standard solution. Theinstrument is optimized with the standard solution at the wavelength specified. It is then zeroed with water, and thesample is aspirated into the flame and its signal read. Without changing the slit, the wavelength is changed to anearby setting and the background value determined. The difference between the background value and the valuefor the sample should not exceed the difference between the values obtained for the sample and standard solutions.7.10.6 Remarks  The manufacturers manual should be consulted for details on the venting of burner gases andfor safety precautions in the operation of the instrument and burner. The user should check the performance of theinstrument from time to time to assure that adequate sensitivity is being attained for the needs of the particulardetermination.7.11 Determination of Trace Elements by Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry  The purpose hereis to describe in general terms how the technique should be used when specified in the procedures for an individualliquid chemical to assure that the specifications for one or more stated elements are met. No general procedure isgiven since operating details will vary with instrument design; consequently, the manufacturers manual should befollowed.

SEMI C1-0705 © SEMI 1978, 2005 20 7.11.1 Equipment  The source is a hollow cathode lamp, or equivalent, for the relevant element. The furnace willcontain a pyrolytic coated graphite tube that has been conditioned according to manufacturers instructions. Themonochromator should have a resolution of at least 0.1 nm. The signal from the photomultiplier tube detector isread from a meter, digital display, or recorder tracing. Zeeman or deuterium background correction can be used. Anautosampler is suggested in order to obtain better reproducibility.7.11.2 Operating Conditions  Use an acceptable flow rate (300 mL per minute) argon as the inert carrier gas,with no flow during the atomization portion of the program. The temperature programs outlined by the instrumentmanufacturers should be checked using known standards, and adapted as necessary for optimum performance for aspecific instrument.

All solutions will be prepared in a clean environment as defined in the SEMI guidelines.7.11.4 Working Standard Solutions  Working standard solutions should be prepared on the day of use by dilutionof a stock standard solution.7.11.5 Sample Preparations  Sample preparation will be analyzed neat, with pre-concentration, or by dilution,according to the individual procedure.7.11.6 Quantification  Results shall be reported as the result of three replicate analyses. Each replicate is theresult of an 8-second integration of the peak area with the instrument in concentration mode. Recording shouldcommence 5 seconds before the atomization, and baseline should be established 2 seconds prior to atomization.Reading should commence 1 second prior to atomization. Alternate integration schemes for the analytical peak shallbe performed in a manner that captures all of the signal, as appropriate for the instrument.7.11.7 Calibration  Calibrate the instrument using a standard prepared in the appropriate grade of 18.2 Mohm-cmwater that meets ASTM Standard Guide D5127, over a concentration range appropriate for the analysis. The blankmust also be contained in the appropriate grade of 18.2 Mohm-cm water that meets ASTM Standard Guide D5127.7.12 Determination of Trace Elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry(ICP-OES)  The purpose here is to describe in general terms how the technique should be used when specified inthe procedures for an individual liquid chemical to assure that the specifications for one or more stated elements aremet. No general procedure is given since operating details will vary with instrument design; consequently, themanufacturers manual should be followed.7.12.1 Equipment  A spectrometer with sufficient resolution to separate the typical spectral lines of the elementsstated in the specification for an individual liquid chemical.

Types of interferences other than the simple overlap of a concomitant line on an analyte line must beconsidered.7.12.3 Solution Conditions  The solutions are prepared as given in the procedures for the individual liquidchemical.7.12.4 Working Standard Solutions  Working standard solutions should be prepared on the day of use by dilutionof a stock standard solution. For best results, standards should be matrix matched.7.12.5 Multi-element standards may be prepared. The components should be selected to provide stable standardswithin the required concentration range.7.12.6 Quantitation  Commonly, the samples are measured against matrix-matched calibration standards;however, whenever a new or unusual matrix is encountered, the method of standard addition is employed. Thestandard addition does not detect coincident spectral overlap; an alternate wavelength or an alternate method isrecommended for verification. A calibration obtained with aqueous standards may be used if its slope and thestandard addition method slope are identical.7.12.7 Evaporation of Sample  The detection limits achievable can be improved by preconcentration of a largesample by evaporation. Through volatilization there may be a loss of trace elements, and recovery study data mustbe obtained. The loss of trace elements in this enrichment process can be reduced, often by the presence ofadditives. The evaporation must be conducted under clean air conditions, and reliability should be assured by useof a blank or control sample determination. The sample size will depend on the detection limits required and thecapability of the instrument used.7.12.8 Background Correction  A background correction technique is required for variable backgroundcontribution to the determination of trace elements. The correction interval should be selected such that the intensityof the background at that wavelength is equal to the background intensity under the analyte peak.7.12.9 Additives  The procedures for the individual liquid chemical will provide detailed instructions for requiredadditives in the sample solution.7.12.10 Remarks  The manufacturers manual should be consulted for proper use of the instrument. The usershould check the performance of the instrument from time to time to assure that adequate sensitivity is beingattained for the needs of the particular determination.

SEMI C1-0705 © SEMI 1978, 2005 22 7.13 Determination of Trace Elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)  Thedetermination of trace elements in liquid chemicals which are commonly used in advanced semi-conductormanufacturing requires a sensitive technique with the ability to perform simultaneous analysis for multiple elements.Achievable detection limits are adequate for sample analysis with little sample preparation prior to analysis. Liquidchemical matrix reduction needed to perform routine analysis is often achieved by dilution of the sample. Waterused for dilution should be the appropriate grade of 18.2 Mohm-cm water that meets ASTM Standard Guide D5127.Matrix removal methods which require sample evaporation should be performed under HEPA filtered air such thatreproducible blank samples are obtained at or less than one half the specified limit of trace elements for the sample.No specific procedure for inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is included since instrumentation andpractices vary among laboratories. Some practical considerations relevant to the method are outlined below.7.13.1 Equipment  A mass spectrometer with better than 1 amu resolution from 5250 amu is required to separatethe isotopes of the elements stated in the specification for an individual liquid chemical. The use of hot or coolplasmas as well as a collision/reaction cell may be required to meet the SEMI detection limit requirements forcertain analytes. The signal from the detector is digitized by a computer system for quantitative calculation.Interference correction may be required for some isotopes. Typical analytically useful masses are listed in Table 11.Table 11 Suggested Analytical MassesElement MassesAluminum (Al) 27Antimony (Sb) 121, 123Arsenic (As) 75Barium (Ba) 137, 138Boron (B) 11Cadmium (Cd) 111, 114Calcium (Ca) 40Chromium (Cr) 52Copper (Cu) 63, 65Iron (Fe) 56Lead (Pb) 206, 207, 208Lithium (Li) 7Magnesium (Mg) 24Manganese (Mn) 55Nickel (Ni) 58, 60Potassium (K) 39Sodium (Na) 23Tin (Sn) 118, 120Titanium (Ti) 48Vanadium (V) 51Zinc (Zn) 64, 66 7.13.2 Sample Introduction  Conventional glassware used for sample introduction is in most cases appropriate forliquid chemical analysis, however for Grade 5 liquid chemicals an ultra clean sample introduction system isrecommended. Liquid chemicals containing hydrofluoric acid (HF) require a HF resistant introduction systemunless the hydrofluoric acid matrix is removed prior to the analysis.7.13.3 Ionization Source  An inductively coupled plasma using argon as the support gas has proven to besatisfactory as an ionization source for the method. Ionization conditions present in the argon plasma are highlydependent on the various argon gas flow rates used to support the plasma. Sample introduction techniques used tointroduce the sample into the plasma are important to the analysis of the samples and must be optimized to allowsuccessful analysis. In particular, sample uptake and nebulizer gas flow require special attention and should betreated carefully in order to optimize instrument performance for each of the various liquid chemicals.

&lt;!-- Page 47 --&gt;

SEMI C1-0705 © SEMI 1978, 200523 7.13.4 Evaporation of Samples  Liquid chemical matrix elements may be the source of spectral interferences oncertain target elements e.g. 48SO interferes with 48Ti in a sulfuric acid matrix when using quadrupole-based ICP-MS. Such spectral interferences may be significantly reduced or eliminated by controlled evaporation of the samplefollowed by dissolution and analysis in ultrapure nitric acid or other suitable solvent.7.13.5 Solution Conditions  The solutions are prepared as given in the procedures for the individual liquidchemicals or elements.7.13.6 Working Standard Solutions  Working standard solutions are prepared daily by dilution of stock standardsolutions. Internal standard solutions, if used, are prepared similarly.7.13.7 Quantification  Quantification may be performed by the method of standard additions or by externalcalibration. External standards may also be matrix matched in ultra pure liquid chemicals to assure that plasmaconditions during the analysis are similar for both standards and samples. For those liquid chemicals, which requirematrix removal, the preferred matrix after preparation is dilute nitric acid (typically 13%.) The working standardsolutions are prepared to cover the expected range of trace element concentration. Background subtraction by use ofa reagent blank solution is may be used for sample analysis by this technique.7.13.8 One or more internal standards (such as indium or rhodium) may be used for drift correction during theanalysis.7.13.9 Remarks  The manufacturers manual should be consulted for details specific to the operation of theinstrument. Performance checks on the instrument should be made from time to time to assure adequate massresolution, performance, and sensitivity.7.14 Calibration and Measurement Method for Particles in Liquids  This standard describes the apparatus andmethods used to calibrate optical particle counters (OPCs) and to count hard particles in liquid reagents. Theprocedures in this standard provide a means of comparison of particle levels in various reagents using pressurizedsampling and counted using the various available instruments. While the procedures in this standard are primarilydirected at off-line sampling or sampling from containers, OPCs can also be used for continuous on-line particlemeasurement. While some substantial technical difficulty may accompany the implementation of the pressurizedsampling technique for containers of more than 10 L, the method should be followed as closely as possible tomaximize the integrity of the data. The following procedures are partially based on the publications in the attachedbibliography, which should be consulted for further details.7.14.1 Apparatus  The apparatus used to measure the concentration of particles in reagents is comprised of asample supply system, a particle counter, and a flow measurement and control system. Two manual flowmeasurement and control systems are presented in Figures 4 and 5. Several manufacturers have developedautomated pressurized sampling systems.7.14.2 Discrete Sample Supply System  In the method specified in this standard, the pressure in the reagentcontainer is raised sufficiently above atmospheric pressure to produce the required flow and to reduce microbubbleformation, which causes falsely high counts. Pressurizing containers of reagents presents a substantial safetyhazard. Several systems have been developed for pressurizing the contents of a reagent container without placing apressure differential across the reagent container wall. A pressurized sampling system is required for all reagents. Figure 5Pressurized Test System

&lt;!-- Page 48 --&gt;

SEMI C1-0705 © SEMI 1978, 2005 24 Figure 6Pressurized Test System 7.14.2.1 The reagent container is placed in a canister suitable for use as a pressure vessel at 4 bar (60 psi), such as alarge steel filter housing. The interior of the canister should be resistant to corrosion by the reagents being tested.This canister is fitted with a relief valve set at 3.5 bar (50 psi), a nitrogen inlet, and a sealed feed-through for thesample tube. The reagent container is fitted with a perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) cap to which is attached a hydrophobicpolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nitrogen inlet filter. This permits the nitrogen pressures inside and outside thereagent container to equilibrate when the vessel is pressurized and prevents particles from the pressure canister fromentering the sample reagent container.7.14.2.2 Either of two sample and dip tube configurations may be used. In the first, a PFA dip tube, which extendsto 5 cm from the bottom of the reagent container, is attached to the cap. The sample tube, which consists of a singlecontinuous piece of PFA tubing to reduce the chance of incidental contamination during measurement, is connectedto the cap and the particle counter. This configuration has the advantage that it allows the sample tube to bedisconnected from the cap and dip tube, reducing the risk of splashing and of cross-contaminating samples. Thedisadvantage of placing a fitting between the sample and the counter is that the fitting may compromise the integrityof the sample.7.14.2.3 In the second configuration, a single tube, without valves, fittings, or discontinuities extends from thecounter, through the cap to 5 cm from the bottom of the reagent container. This has the advantage that it ensures theintegrity of the sample but the disadvantage is that the risk of splashing and cross-contamination is increased.7.14.3 Particle Counter  Laser light scattering OPCs from any of several suppliers may be used provided they arein calibration, and used subject to the limitations described in 7.14.3.1.7.14.3.1 Limitations on Counting Particles in Liquid Reagents using OPCs  OPCs are calibrated usingpolystyrene latex (PSL) beads suspended in high purity water. The optical properties of naturally occurring particlesin liquid reagents are different from the optical properties of PSL and water. OPCs detect light-scattering centersand calculate particle size and concentration based on the assumption that the light-scattering centers are equivalentto PSL in water. In reality, light scattered by a particle is dependent upon particle size, particle shape and thedifference between the particles refractive index and the refractive index of the surrounding medium. Whenproperly calibrated OPCs from different manufacturers are used to measure particles in high purity water, they givecomparable size and concentration data.7.14.3.1.1 Commercially, OPCs are manufactured with different illuminating wavelengths and a variety of opticalarrangements for collecting light scattered by particles. Because of the significant difference in the refractive indexof particles relative to the refractive index of water, the resulting scattered light profile is readily detected by allOPCs. Hence there is relatively good comparative agreement between OPCs when used to detect particles in highpurity water.7.14.3.1.2 When calibrated OPCs are used to measure particles in semiconductor liquid reagents, a totally differentsituation is encountered. The refractive index of liquid reagents varies significantly from water and is, in general,greater than water. While the refractive index of reagents is known and can be adjusted for, the refractive index ofparticles is unknown and, in many circumstances, is expected to be very close to the refractive index of reagents.

&lt;!-- Page 49 --&gt;

SEMI C1-0705 © SEMI 1978, 200525 Particles therefore have a tendency to become invisible to an OPC. The degree of invisibility will depend on theoptical arrangement of each OPC. A study carried out in 1999 8 found that particle concentrations reported bydifferent sensors varied significantly. Chemical-to-chemical comparison indicated that there was no sensor thatconsistently reported higher or lower concentrations than other sensors.7.14.3.2 Using OPCs in Semiconductor Liquid Reagents  OPCs have a critical role to play in monitoring particlesin liquid reagents. OPCs can detect low concentrations of small particles in real-time and can be easily calibratedusing PSL beads. However, the current state of OPC technology limits their use to claim that a liquid reagent meetsa standard particle concentration at a particular particle size.7.14.3.2.1 When a supplier of a liquid reagent uses an OPC to specify that reagents particle concentration, forexample on a Certificate of Analysis, the make and model of OPC must also be specified. If the customer of theliquid reagents wishes to check whether the incoming reagent meets the claimed level of cleanliness, the customermust use an OPC of the same make and model number. However, it has also been shown that even two calibratedidentical OPCs can differ by 1020% when measuring particles in liquid reagents.7.14.4 Flow Control and Measurement System  A discrete or a continuous method may be used to control andmeasure the flow of the sample through the particle counter. In both procedures, a needle valve, downstream of thecounter, is used to control the flow rate. In the discrete procedure, a measured volume of fluid is counted andcollected in a graduated container. Automatic level detection may be used to start and stop the counter. In thecontinuous procedure, the flow rate is set and the count is accumulated for a measured time period.7.14.5 Calibration  Each particle counter (sensor and signal analysis unit) must be calibrated at least once everytwelve months.7.14.5.1 It is recommended that the calibration be performed by the instrument manufacturer or a metrologylaboratory certified by the instrument manufacturer. Calibration is performed by counting polystyrene latex (PSL)beads suspended in water. PSL beads of known size (characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) andconcentration (characterized by a scanning electron microscope SEM) must be used. In addition most instrumentmanufacturers use a working standard or gold standard OPC as a reference against which all OPCs of the sameModel are compared.7.14.5.2 The determination of size correction factors for particle counters is not recommended. Particle countersshould be calibrated with PSL beads in accordance with the manufacturers recommendation.7.14.6 Coincidence Correction Factors  The determination of coincidence correction factors for particle countersis not recommended. Particle counters should be calibrated with PSL beads as per the manufacturersrecommendation. Coincidence correction factors are only valid for monodispersed concentration of particles.7.14.7 Efficiency Correction Factors  The determination of efficiency correction factors for particle counters isnot recommended. Particle counters should be calibrated with PSL beads as per the manufacturersrecommendation.7.14.8 Monthly Check  It is desirable to check the OPCs size calibration once a month. PSL beads of known sizeand approximate concentration can be purchased from several suppliers. Prepare a stock suspension of acombination of about 10 7 particles/L of each of the three sizes of PSL beads. Several solutions have been found toprovide acceptably stable suspensions. Among them are: 25:1 ethanol/: water, and water with 0.01% surfactant and0.05% bactericide. Dilute 10 mL of stock suspension to 1 L and measure the particle concentration using theprocedure specified for reagents. If the results of this check are not within 10% of the expected PSL bead size, theOPC shall be recalibrated.7.14.9 Measurement Procedure7.14.9.1 Setup  Gently invert the sample reagent container three times to homogenize the particle distribution,then set it aside for 30 minutes to remove the bubbles formed during mixing. Under no circumstances must thesample reagent container be vigorously shaken or sonicated as this would generate numerous particles. 8 Carrieri, D., D.C.Grant and W.Kelly, A Comparison of Optical Particle Sensors Used to Measure Particle Concentration in High-PurityProcess Chemicals Proceedings SEMICON West 1999

SEMI C1-0705 © SEMI 1978, 2005 26 7.14.9.2 The smallest particle counter threshold should deliver at least 50% particle counting efficiency at thecontrol size limit. The control size limit is the particle size agreed upon between supplier and customer thatrepresents an acceptable size level. In general this size will be between 0.1 and 0.5 m.7.14.9.3 Attach the cap with the gas inlet filter and sample tube to the reagent container to be sampled. Place thereagent container in the canister, and seal the canister so that it may be pressurized. With the sample flow controlvalve open, gradually (&lt; 3 bar/min) pressurize the sample to 3 bar for H2O 2 and NH 4OH or as necessary to obtainthe required flow for other fluids. Allow at least 250 mL of the sample to pass through the sensor before counting.7.14.9.4 For each sample, after 5 aliquots have been measured, perform a chi-squared test to determine if the dataare statistically valid. If the chi-squared test fails, examine the apparatus for defects, such as loose or crackedfittings, repair as necessary, and repeat the counting of 5 aliquots. If the sample fails both the second and third chi-squared tests, it is considered to be immeasurable and should be discarded. If a second sample gives similar results,the apparatus, including the OPC, may be defective and should be checked with a well-characterized sample andrepaired if necessary.7.14.10 Measurement7.14.10.1 Discrete Sampling  Measure multiple aliquots of the same sample. The flow rate must be the same asthat at which the instrument was calibrated. The statistical significance of any count data must be taken intoconsideration. Some OPCs inspect as little as 1/1000 th of the available sample flow, and may require a greaternumber of aliquots and larger sampling volume to ensure good statistics. For example, to obtain a coefficient ofvariation (standard deviation/mean) of 10%, it is necessary that at least 100 particles greater than the control sizelimit be counted.7.14.10.2 Continuous Sampling  If continuous sampling apparatus is being used, adjust the needle valve on therotameter to obtain a flow rate consistent with the instrument manufacturers recommendations. This flow rate mustbe the same as that at which the instrument was calibrated. Correct the indicated value for the effect of the fluiddensity and viscosity on the rotameter reading. Allow the first minutes fluid to flow to drain, then count theparticles in each of five, 15 second intervals. The statistical significance of any count data must be taken intoconsideration. Some OPCs inspect as little as 1/1000 th of the available sample flow, and may require a greaternumber of aliquots and larger sampling volume to ensure good statistics. For example, to obtain a coefficient ofvariation (standard deviation/mean) of 10%, it is necessary that at least 100 particles greater than the control sizelimit be counted.7.14.11 Shutdown  As in all portions of this procedure, appropriate safe liquid chemical handling practices mustbe used. In particular, attention should be paid to the reactions between different reagents and between reagents anddiluents, including water, and to the inherent hazards of these materials.7.14.11.1 After the measurement has been completed, vent the pressure vessel to atmospheric pressure through anappropriate scrubber or exhaust hood, then flush the vessel with nitrogen to remove residual reagent vapors.7.14.11.2 Flush the OPC and sample system with water or an appropriate solvent to remove the remaining fluid.7.14.12 Coincidence and Efficiency Corrections  The determination of coincidence and efficiency correctionfactors for particle counters is not recommended. If an OPCs maximum concentration is exceeded, a different OPCshould be selected, or the sample diluted. However any sample dilution will impose additional error and is notrecommended.7.14.13 Index of Refraction Correction  The determination of an index of refraction correction factor for particlecounters is not recommended, as the refractive index of the contaminating particle is unknown.
