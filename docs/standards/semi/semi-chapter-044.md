SEMI E54.16-0705 © SEMI 20051 SEMI E54.16-0705SPECIFICATION FOR SENSOR/ACTUATOR NETWORKCOMMUNICATIONS FOR LONWORKS This standard was technically approved by the global Information & Control Committee. This edition wasapproved for publication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on April 7, 2005. It was availableat www.semi.org in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005. NOTICE: This document replaced SEMI E54.6 in 2005. 1 Purpose1.1 This standard specification defines a communication specification based on the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 ControlNetworking Protocol (LONW ORKS) to enable communications between intelligent devices on a sensor/actuatornetwork (SAN) that operate in accordance with SEMI-specified device models (common and device specific) onsemiconductor manufacturing equipment.1.2 This document specifies a mapping of the SEMI Common Device Model (CDM) onto LON W ORKS technologyusing the L ON MARK Interoperability Guidelines established for LONW ORKS devices. The LON MARK InternationalAssociation will review and approve the enhanced SEMI L ON MARK functional profiles presented in this networkcommunication document and incorporate the required SEMI profiles into the L ON MARK InteroperabilityGuidelines.1.3 Background and Motivation  The LONW ORKS communications system provides interconnection of smartcontrol devices such as sensors, actuators, and controllers in a fast-response time, low-cost network for industrialuse. LONW ORKS enables multiple devices to share a single network, thereby significantly reducing the point-to-pointwiring between controllers, sensors, and actuators. The LON W ORKS network communications standard (NCS) isbased on the seven-layer ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (LON W ORKS) protocol, implemented by the Neuron Chip, aphysical layer transceiver, and an optional host processor. The ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L ONW ORKS ) controlnetworking protocol was developed by Echelon and may be freely licensed for implementation on any hardwareplatform. The SEMI NCS for LONW ORKS is based on the LON MARK interoperability guidelines, which provide aframework for interoperable use of the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (LONW ORKS ) protocol at layers 1-6, as well as at theapplication layer. Where the LON MARK interoperability guidelines do not provide the functionality required by theSEMI Common Device Model (CDM) and the SEMI Specific Device models (SDM), the guidelines are extendedwith SEMI-specific enhanced profile requirements. 2 Scope2.1 This document specifies a SAN communications specification standard, based on the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1Control Networking Protocol (LONW ORKS ) specification, that enables communication with SAN devices configuredaccording to the SEMI SAN Common Device Model and appropriate SEMI SAN Specific Device Model (SDM)specifications. 2.2 This document specifies the use of LONW ORKS technology for services that compliant intelligent devices mustsupport in order to exchange information over this semiconductor equipment sensor/actuator network.2.3 This document specifies the utilization of LON W ORKS technology to present externally visible device structureand behavior, specified in the CDM and appropriate SDMs, on a LONW ORKS network.2.4 This document is used in conjunction with the SEMI SAN Common Device Model specification and one ormore SEMI SAN Specific Device Model specifications (e.g., for a mass flow controller). Together, the modeldocuments describe the externally visible data structures and behavior of devices using LON W ORKS technology in aSEMI-compliant SAN system.2.5 This specification, together with the sensor/actuator network common device model, one or more sensor/actuator network specific device model documents, the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (LONW ORKS ) protocol specification,and the LON MARK interoperability guidelines, specifies requirements for SEMI SAN implementations based onLON W ORKS technology.

Input and output network variables and configuration properties may be read and/orwritten by the device itself, and all attributes may be polled over the network. Additionally, input network variablesand configuration properties may be updated over the network, and the receipt of such an update may cause an eventto be propagated to the device's application layer. This corresponds to a RW (Read and Write) attribute of the objectowning the network variable. Output network variables may not be updated over the network. This corresponds to aRO (Read Only) attribute of the object owning the network variable. When the device itself updates one of its outputnetwork variables, the value of that variable may be propagated over the network to destination addressesdetermined at installation time. Finally, configuration properties are attributes typically stored in non-volatilememory and preserved across device resets and power cycles.5.4.2 behavior  Generic object behavior is specified by the L ON MARK Application Layer InteroperabilityGuidelines. Additional object-specific behavior is specified by means of functional profiles.5.4.3 device  A device (or node) typically consists of one network transceiver which implements the physicallayer of the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L ON W ORKS) protocol, one Neuron Chip with associated firmware whichimplements the other layers of the LON TALK protocol, and input/output hardware implementing the physicalinterface of the device to external sensor and/or actuator hardware. A LONW ORKS device may optionally contain ahost processor and associated software or firmware which implements the application layer of the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (LONW ORKS ) protocol.5.4.4 device model  The device model comprises several elements which fully describe the external interface ofthe device for an interoperable network. The interface is made of the following pieces: a Device Manager (DM)object; a Sensor/Actuator/Controller (SAC) object; functional blocks such as sensors, actuators, and controllers;individual network variables; and configuration properties.5.4.5 instance  Real devices may have zero or more instances of each of the defined functional blocks. Objectinstances are identified by means of an instance number within the device.5.4.6 object  Functional blocks defined as a set of one or more network variable inputs and/or outputs,implemented as Standard Network Variable Types, and a set of configuration properties, implemented as StandardConfiguration Property Types. Functional blocks form the basis of interoperability at the application layer. Thefunctional blocks describe standard formats for how information is input to, and output from, a device, and sharedwith other devices on the network.5.4.7 service  Request services are represented by ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1input network variables (NVI) being setand delivered to the device application. Notification services are represented by ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1outputnetwork variables being set by the device application and delivered over the network.

SEMI E54.16-0705 © SEMI 20055 5.4.8 state diagram  In a L ONW ORKS device, state is represented by the collection of values of local and networkvariables of the application program. Transitions between states are the result of external events (such as the receiptof a network variable update, or other I/O event), or internal events (such as the expiration of a timer).5.5 L ON WORKS -Specific Definitions  In addition to the standard data type definitions for bit, nibble, byte, andcharacter, the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L ON W ORKS) protocol defines a set of standard data representations for use asattribute values.5.5.1 binding  Network variables on the same or different devices may be associated together by means of anetwork management service known as binding. Binding is permitted only if all the network variables in the set areof the same data type. The values of network variables that are bound together are propagated over the network bythe ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L ON W ORKS ) protocol. Table 2 shows the permitted combinations for updating andpolling of network variables.Table 2 Updating and Polling of Network Variables Network VariableClassUpdate fromNetworkUpdate from Device Poll from Network Poll from Device Input Yes Yes Yes Yes #2Output No Yes#1 Yes No#1 When the device updates one of its own output network variables, input network variables that are bound to this output network variablereceive an update from the network.#2 When the device polls one of its own input or configuration network variables, output network variables that are bound to this input orconfiguration network variable receive a poll from the network. 5.5.2 configuration properties  These are attributes of a functional block that are used to configure theapplication-specific behavior of the functional block, such as sensor gain and offset, linearization table, and samplerate. These attributes are typically updated when the device is installed, configured, or calibrated, and are stored innon-volatile memory.5.5.3 device interface  A device interface is a specification of one or more functional blocks, together withsemantic definitions relating the behavior of the functional block(s) to the network variable values. The collection offunctional blocks in a device corresponds to the SEMI SAN device-specific model for that device. Each type ofdevice interface is identified by a standard program ID (SPID).5.5.4 network variable  This is a network-visible data attribute of a device, with a well-defined data type.Network variables are either input variables, output variables, or configuration network variables. The value of anetwork variable may be updated either by the device itself, or over the network by some other device. Thiscorresponds to the SEMI specific service SetAttribute operation. The value of a network variable may be polled overthe network by some other device, or retrieved by the device itself. This corresponds to the SEMI specific serviceGetAttribute operation.5.5.5 functional block  A devices external interface documentation specifies the type identifiers of the functionalblocks contained within the device. This documentation may be uploaded from the device, and completely specifiesthe functional profiles implemented by the device, as well as the network variables and configuration propertiescontained within each of the functional blocks.5.5.6 functional profile  A functional profile is the definition of the attributes and behaviors of an abstract entity.Each type of functional block is identified by a functional profile number. A specific device type consists ofinstantiations of one or more of these functional profiles. A functional block is implemented as a collection ofnetwork variables and configuration properties.5.5.7 standard configuration property types  These data types, also known as SCPTs, provide a data typedefinition and a semantic behavior for the configuration properties of functional blocks. A list of all available SCPTsand details of their definitions is provided in the SCPT Master List and Programmers Guide.5.5.8 standard network variable types  These data types, also known as SNVTs, facilitate interoperability byproviding a well-defined interface for communication between devices made by different manufacturers. A devicemay be installed in a network, and logically connected to other devices via network variables, as long as the data

At each layer, there isa description of the services provided within that layer. The high level protocol architecture is shown in Figure 1.

Implementations typically use the NeuronChip and its associated firmware, which provide a conforming implementation of layers 2 through 6. The LonMarkInteroperability Guidelines specify the protocol options to be used, most specifically at the physical layer (networktransceivers) and at the application layer (object model).6.2 Physical Layer  The device shall employ one of the LONMARK-approved physical channels as specified in theL ON MARK Layers 16 Interoperability Guidelines. LON W ORKS-based SEMI SAN-compliant devices shall use, bydefault, a two-pin screw-terminal open pluggable connector (Weidmller-Klippon SL2, Phoenix Combicon, orequivalent) for the network connection. The default connector specification may be overridden for specific devicetypes if special requirements apply; any such overrides shall be noted in 9, Specific Device Type Information, ofthis document. This connection is polarity-insensitive. The requirements of semiconductor equipment may be metby one of the twisted pair channel specifications listed below.6.2.1 TP/XF-1250 Twisted Pair  This twisted-pair channel operates at a bit rate of 1,250kbps and supports a bustopology using transformer-coupled transceivers.6.2.2 TP/FT-10 Twisted Pair  This twisted-pair channel operates at a bit rate of 78kbps and supports both freetopology and bus topology wiring, as well as optional link power.6.2.3 The L ON MARK Layers 1-6 Interoperability Guidelines provide specific details of the characteristics of thesetransceivers. This document also provides specifications of wiring types and interconnection topologies to be usedfor guaranteed device interoperability. Note that the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (LONW ORKS ) protocol supportsheterogeneous networks. Devices with dissimilar transceivers may be interconnected and communicate via routersor repeaters. Similarly, routers and repeaters may be used to extend a physical channel beyond the device count,wire length, or other physical limitations imposed by the chosen transceiver.

SEMI E54.16-0705 © SEMI 20057 6.2.4 Multiple physical layer protocols and data encoding methods are used in the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1(LONW ORKS ) protocol. Differential Manchester encoding is used on twisted pair physical layers.6.3 Link Layer  The device shall comply with the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L ONW ORKS) protocol link layerspecification. This layer includes the media access control sublayer. For a number of reasons, including simplicityand compatibility with the multicast protocol, the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L ONW ORKS) protocol supports a simpleconnectionless service. Its functions are limited to framing, frame encoding, and error detection.6.3.1 Media Access Control Sub-layer  In order to deal with a variety of media in the potential absence ofcollision detection, the MAC (Media Access Control) sub-layer employs a collision avoidance algorithm calledPredictive p-persistent CSMA (Carrier Sense, Multiple Access).6.4 Network Layer  The device shall comply with the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L ONW ORKS ) protocol networklayer specification. This layer handles packet delivery within a single domain, with no provisions for inter-domaincommunication. The network service is connection-less, unacknowledged, and supports neither segmentation nor re-assembly of messages. The routing algorithms employed by the network layer to learn the topology assume a tree-like network topology; routers with configured tables may operate on topologies with physical loops, as long as thecommunication paths are logically tree-like. In this configuration, a packet may never appear more than once at therouter on the side on which the packet originated. The unicast routing algorithm uses learning for minimal overheadand no additional routing traffic. Use of configured routing tables is supported for both unicast and multicastaddresses.6.5 Transport Layer  The device shall comply with the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L ONW ORKS ) protocol transportlayer specification. The heart of the protocol hierarchy is the Transport and Session layers. A common TransactionControl sub-layer handles transaction ordering and duplicate detection for both layers. The transport layer isconnectionless and provides reliable message delivery to both single and multiple destinations. Authentication of themessage senders identity is provided as an optional feature. The authentication server requires only the TransactionControl sub-layer to accomplish its function. The transport and session layer messages may be authenticated usingall of the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1addressing modes other than broadcast. The transport layer supports end-to-endacknowledged service and an unacknowledged/ repeated service.6.6 Session Layer  The device shall comply with the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (LONW ORKS ) protocol session layerspecification. This layer implements a simple Request-Response mechanism for access to remote servers. Thismechanism provides a platform upon which application-specific remote procedure calls can be built. TheANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L ON W ORKS) network management protocol, for example, is dependent on the Request-Response mechanism in the Session layer, even though it accesses the protocol via the application layer interface.6.7 Presentation Layer  The device shall comply with the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L ONW ORKS ) protocolpresentation layer specification. The Presentation layer and the Application layer taken together form the foundationof interoperability for LONW ORKS devices. The application layer provides all the usual services for sending andreceiving messages, but it also contains the concept of network variables. The presentation layer providesinformation in the Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) header for how the APDU is to be interpreted fornetwork variable updates. This application-independent interpretation of the data allows data to be shared amongdevices without prior arrangement. With agreement on which network variables are to be used for sensors, actuators,etc., intelligent components from different manufacturers may work together without prior knowledge of eachother's characteristics.6.8 Application Layer  At the application layer, interoperability between LON W ORKS -based devices is facilitatedthrough the use of functional blocks and Standard Network Variable Types (SNVTs). Functional blocks build uponnetwork variables and provide a concise application layer interface that incorporates semantic meaning for specificdevice functions. Functional blocks not only define which SNVTs to use to convey data, but also provide semanticmeaning about the information being communicated. To aid in the specification of specific device models with well-defined functional behavior, functional block interfaces and semantics are defined by functional profiles. TheApplication Layer also includes the LON W ORKS file transfer protocol, which provides segmentation and reassemblyof arbitrary length files of data. This service may be used to get and set object attributes that exceed the networkvariable size limit of 31 bytes.6.8.1 Object Models  The ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (LONW ORKS ) protocol provides an object-oriented specificationfor defining and addressing network variables and configuration properties, which are the representation of objectattributes and events. The device shall comply with the object model specifications defined in 7 of this document.

SEMI E54.16-0705 © SEMI 2005 8 6.8.2 Functional Block Structure  The L ON MARK Application Layer Interoperability Guidelines define a structurefor functional profiles. Each functional profile may have a set of mandatory network variables, a set of optionalnetwork variables, a set of configuration properties (both mandatory and optional), and a manufacturer-definedsection, which may be used for non-interoperable extensions to the profile. This is illustrated in Figure 2. Thisnotation is defined in the L ONMARK Application Layer Interoperability Guidelines. NOTE: Diagram notation, the arrow-like symbol used in Figure 2 is defined in the LonMark Application Layer InteroperabilityGuidelines.Figure 2LonMark Object Structure 6.8.3 The L ON MARK Application Layer Interoperability Guidelines provide for the definition of Standard NetworkVariable Types, Standard Configuration Property Types, and Functional Profiles. In the mapping of the SEMI CDMto the LON MARK object structure in 7, extensions to the current SNVT list and LON MARK InteroperabilityGuidelines are marked with an asterisk (\*). Functional profile numbers are specified by the guidelines; a device mayconsist of one instance of a Node Object type, and one or more instances of other functional profiles.6.9 Network Management  The ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (LON W ORKS ) protocol defines a complete networkmanagement and diagnostic protocol for LON W ORKS devices. This protocol is a layer above the Session layer(request/response service) and provides mechanisms for application downloading, device address assignment,distribution of destination addresses for implicit messaging, router configuration, and device-level diagnostics. TheL ON MARK Application Layer Interoperability Guidelines define a device management layer for functional blocks. 7 Required and Optional Object Types7.1 The L ON MARK guidelines do not require any specific objects to exist in a device in order to be a compliantLON MARK device, except that a Node object functional block is required for devices that contain multiple functionalblocks (SEMI compliant devices will typically have a Node object functional block). New LONMARK standardprofiles are defined in this standard to identify and describe functional blocks that shall exist in devices that are to beinteroperable and interchangeable on a LON MARK SEMI compliant SAN network.7.1.1 LON MARK International Association publishes functional profiles for various sensor, actuator, and controllerobjects. A specific device may be implemented using functional blocks based on these profiles. The CommonDevice Model specification additionally identifies two functional blocks (namely the Device Manager (DM) andSensor Actuator Controller (SAC) objects) that must exist in all SEMI compliant SAN devices. The requiredfunctional profiles for a SEMI compliant SAN device utilizing the network communication specification describedherein necessarily comprise, at minimum, the union of the L ON MARK functional profile requirements and the CDMspecification requirements.7.1.2 A list of required and optional object types is given in Table 3. Additional objects that are specified in aparticular SDM are given identifiers in that SDM specification. The L ON MARK specific presentation information forthese identifiers is given in 9 of this document.

See LON MARK Application LayerInteroperability Guideline and http://types.lonmark.org.#2 See E54.1  CDM specification for further information#3 A turnaround connection is not a profile, but is a protocol-specific method for creating a link#4 The LonMark Application Layer maps the SEMI Device Manger (DM) and Sensor/Actuator/Controller (SAC) objects to the LonMark Nodeobject. 7.1.3 Service Requests Code  Most service requests are implemented as network variable updates addressed to thenetwork variable corresponding to the specified attribute. The exceptions to this mapping are requests that requiremore than a 31 byte response. In that case, the request is implemented as a network variable update containing a filerequest to an nviSemiReq input to the Node Object functional block of a device. This input is defined by theSNVT\_semi\_req type as follows:typedef enum &#123;struct &#123;CMD\_RESET = 1,CMD\_ABORT = 2,CMD\_RECOVER = 3,CMD\_GET\_ATTRIBUTE = 4,CMD\_SET\_ATTRIBUTE = 5,CMD\_OERATE = 6,CMD\_RESTOTE\_DEFAULT = 7,CMD\_PUBLISH\_ATTRIBUTE = 8,CMD\_LOCK = 9,

The nvoSemiStat output is defined by the SNVT\_semi\_status type as follows:typedef enum &#123;struct &#123;STAT\_SUCCESS = 0,STAT\_UNSUPPORTED\_SERVICE = 1,STAT\_UNSUPPORTED\_ATTRIBUTE = 2,STAT\_SET\_ATTRIBUTE\_ERROR = 3,STAT\_GET\_ATTRIBUTE\_ERROR = 4,STST\_CALIBRATION\_ERROR = 5,STAT\_SERVICE\_REQUEST\_ERROR = 6,STAT\_DIAGNOSTIC\_ERROR = 7,&#125; semi\_status\_t;typedef struct &#123;semi\_status\_t status;unsigned long selected\_file;struct address &#123; // Address of the requesting deviceunsigned short domain\_id\[6\];unsigned short domain\_length;unsigned short subnet;unsigned short node;&#125;&#125; SNVT\_semi\_status; 7.1.5 If the nvoSemiStat and nvoFileStat outputs indicate the request was accepted, the requesting device thenfetches the requested data by transferring the file with the file index reported by the nvoSemiStat response.7.1.6 Object Attributes  The SEMI GetAttribute and SEMI SetAttribute service requests are implemented asnetwork variable fetch, poll, and update requests addressed to the network variable corresponding to the specifiedattribute. This is appropriate when responses greater than 31 bytes are not required. A GetAttribute service requestmay be addressed directly to any network variable as a LonTalk request message, using the LonTalk protocolnetwork management NV fetch mechanism. A GetAttribute service request may also be addressed to an outputnetwork variable as a LonTalk NV poll message, using the NV selection mechanism. A SetAttribute service request

&lt;!-- Page 16 --&gt;

SEMI E54.16-0705 © SEMI 200511 may be addressed to an input network variable as a LonTalk NV update message, using the NV selectionmechanism. The confirmation of a SetAttribute (network variable update) is provided by the acknowledged serviceof the LonTalk protocol transport layer.7.1.7 Sequence Numbers  Each network variable in a functional block is identified by means of a self-documentation string stored in the devices memory. This string contains the functional block index of the functionalblock to which this variable belongs, and the Sequence Number of the network variable within its functional block.For the L ONW ORKS NCS, this sequence number is identical to the numerical sequence number specified by theCDM tag. As an example, using the Device Manager object instance declared as the second object instance in thedevice it has an Instance Id of 1. The Device Manager attribute Standard Revision Level has the tag DmA2. Theself-documentation string for this network variable is, therefore, specified as @1|2.7.1.8 Publish Service  The Publish notification service is implicit when an output network variable is updated.The device propagates the value of the output network variable (equivalent to a read-only attribute) to any inputnetwork variable(s) to which it may be bound. The ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L ONW ORKS ) protocol only supportspropagation of output network variables. In CDM terminology, this means that only read-only attributes may bepublished. If a specific device model requires publication of a read/write attribute, an output network variable whosevalue mirrors the value of the input (read/write) network variable may be introduced to the object definition.7.2 Sensor/Actuator/Controller Object (\*)  The SEMI CDM SAC object coordinates the functionality of Sensor,Actuator, and Controller objects in the device. The SAC object is mapped to the LON MARK Node object functionalblock. Each device must support one (and only one) Node object functional block. The SAC functional block aswell as its common required and optional attributes, services and behavior are described in document SEMI E54.1the CDM standard specification. Extensions to the current SNVT list and L ON MARK Interoperability Guidelines aremarked with an asterisk (\*).7.2.1 Extensions to the Node Object functional profile are defined in the LONMARK Interoperability Guidelines,which form part of the LONMARK Functional Profiles for SEMI SAN-compliant devices based on LONW ORKStechnology. Table 4 summarizes the network variables that implement the attributes of the SAC object.

The Device Manager object is mapped to the LON MARK Node objectfunctional block. Each device must support one (and only one) Node Object functional block. The DM functionalblock as well as its common required and optional attributes, services and behavior are described in SEMI E54.1 theCDM standard specification. Extensions to the current SNVT list and L ON MARK Interoperability Guidelines aremarked with an asterisk (\*).7.3.1 The SEMI CDM Device Manager functional block, which is mapped to the LON MARK Node object, combinesattributes of device self-documentation with an exception reporting mechanism. A new functional profile is,therefore, defined with the following mandatory configuration parameters, network variables and behaviors. Thisfunctional profile forms part of the LON MARK Functional Profiles for SEMI SAN-compliant devices based onLON W ORKS .

This parameter is optional. The default reporting mode is REP\_REQUEST.7.3.4.3 Device Manager Functional Block Output Network Variables  The Device Manager functional block ofthe CDM defines the attribute variable Device Status. The data type SNVT\_dev\_status is an enumeration. One fieldof the union is an enumeration, corresponding to the device status attribute defined by the table Device StatusAttribute Values of the CDM. The values of this type are defined in Table 8.Table 8 Device Status Attribute Variable Enumeration Values Value Enumeration Tag0 DS\_UNKNOWN1 DS\_INIT\_SELFTEST2 DS\_IDLE3 DS\_SELFTEST\_EXCPT4 DS\_EXECUTING5 DS\_ABORT\_16 DS\_ABORT\_2 7.3.4.4 The application programming language used to declare SNVT\_dev\_status is as follows:typedef enum &#123;DS\_UNKNOWN = 0,DS\_INIT\_SELFTEST = 1,DS\_IDLE = 2,DS\_SELFTEST\_EXCPT = 3,DS\_EXECUTING = 4,

Byvirtue of the fact that the intermediate layers of the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L ONW ORKS ) protocol are implementedin commercially available silicon, compliance verification is needed only at the physical and application layers. TheLON MARK Interoperability Association provides a compliance verification service to its members. When the SEMISensor/Actuator Network functional profiles are approved and incorporated by LON MARK International Association,this service may be used to verify compliance with the SEMI guidelines.8.2 The certification procedure and checklist may be viewed and obtained by accessing web sitehttp://www.lonmark.org.

Each subsection is devoted to a single Specific Device Model specification. As additional SEMI SDMspecifications are created, additional SDM mappings are added as subsections to this NCS specification. Unlessotherwise noted, all attributes and services described are instance level attributes (as opposed to class levelattributes). Device-type-specific items, such as overrides to the standard connector, may also be noted in thesesubsections.9.1.1 Note that the formats of object instance attributes and services are detailed in the associated Specific DeviceModel specification. The presentation of the attributes and services to a LONW ORKS network is detailed in the tablescontained in the following sub-sections and in the L ON MARK Application Layer Interoperability Guidelinesdocument. Note that relationships between object classes, including inheritance are defined in the associated SDMspecification and the CDM specification.9.1.2 The instance identifier format of 1 through n, assigned to an object type, refers to the possibility of multipleinstantiations of the object type. Refer to Table 3 of this document and the CDM document for a further explanationof object instance assignments.9.2 Specific Device Model For Mass Flow Device  These sections detail the network mapping required to supportthe Specific Device Model For Mass Flow Device (see reference SEMI E54.3 of 4.1).
