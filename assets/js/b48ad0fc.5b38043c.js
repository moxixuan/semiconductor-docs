It  is  the\nresponsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish\nappropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine\nthe applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior\nto use.\n3  Limitations\n3. 1    LLSs  are  normally  assigned  only  LSE  sizes,  not\nphysical diameters, because the response of an SSIS to\nan    LLS    depends    on    the    SSIS    optical    system\ncharacteristics    as    well    as    the    size,    shape,    and\ncomposition  of  the  LLS.    The  LSE  size  assigned  to  a\nparticular   LLS   by   an   SSIS   calibrated   against   PSL\nspheres may be different from that assigned to the same\nLLS   by   another   similarly   calibrated   SSIS,   because\ndifferent     SSISs     have     different     optical     system\ncharacteristics.\n3. 2    PSL  spheres  may  have  specified  characteristics\n(mean   diameter   uncertainty,   diameter   distribution,\nspread  between  mean  and  modal  diameter)  that  differ\nsignificantly  from  the  characteristics  of  the  resulting\ndeposition due to the transfer function of the deposition\nsystem.  For this reason the practice is limited to the use\nof   PSL   sphere   depositions   that   are   appropriately\ncharacterized.  See Related Information 1.\n3. 3    If  calibration  points  occur  at,  or  near,  dips  in  the\nresponse  curve  (see  Section  5.3.17),  the  calibration\ncurve  will  not  be  single  valued;  therefore  dips  must  be\navoided as calibration points if a monotonic calibration\ncurve  is  to  be  obtained.    However,  if  a  complete\ncalibration  is  desired,  the  locations  and  magnitudes  of\nthe dips must be determined.  In this case there may not\nbe a one-to-one correlation between SSIS response and\nLSE  size;  i.e.,  a  particular  instrument  response  may\ncorrespond  to  more  than  one  LSE  size.\n1\n(See  Section\n5. 3.13.1.)\n3. 4  Background Contamination\n3. 4.1    The  presence  of  localized  light  scatterers  with\nLSE sizes near that of the nominal PSL diameter on the\nreference  wafer  may  skew  the  results.

This  condition  may  also  result  in  a  large\nerror or poor equivalent sizing accuracy.\n3. 4.3    For  these  reasons,  both  the  deposition  process\nand  calibration  procedures  must  be  carried  out  in  a\nclean  environment,  and  the  reference  wafers  must  be\nhandled   in   such   a   way   as   to   avoid   contamination\nbetween deposition process and calibration.\n3. 5    If  the  surface  roughness  of  the  reference  wafer  or\nwafers   is   excessive,   the   peak   of   the   PSL   sphere\ndistribution may be obscured or distorted.\n3. 6    If  the  SSIS  being  calibrated  is  not  operating  in  a\nstable condition, the calibration may not be appropriate\nfor subsequent use of the system.

This  unit  varies  in\ndifferent  ways  for  different  materials  from  instrument\nto  instrument  because  of  differences  in  the  optical\nsystems  and  signal  processing  procedures  of  different\ninstruments.

If  elements  of  the  optical  system,  such  as\nincidence  angle,  collection  solid  angle,  or  polarization,\nof  an  SSIS  can  be  varied,  the  LSE  size  of  a  particular\nLLS   will   not   necessarily   be   the   same   for   each\nconfiguration of the optical system.\n5. 3.11  localized  light  scatterer  (LLS)  \xf3  an  isolated\nfeature,  such  as  a  particle  or  a  pit,  on  or  in  a  wafer\nsurface,  resulting  in  increased  light  scattering  intensity\nrelative   to   that   of   the   surrounding   wafer   surface;\nhistorically called light point defect because under high\nintensity  optical  illumination  features  of  sufficient  size\nappear as an isolated point of light.\n5. 3.11.1  Discussion \xf3  Localized  light  scatterers  are\nobserved  by  automated  inspection  techniques  as  laser-\nlight    scattering    events.

The amount of light\nscattered  from  a  localized  light  scatterer  (LLS)  that  is\ncaptured by the SSIS is a function of both the scattering\ncharacteristics  of  the  LLS  (including  the  directional\ndependence  of  the  scattering)  and  the  geometry  of  the\ncollection  optics  of  the  SSIS.    For  a  given  wavelength\nof  incident  radiation,  regular  objects  of  certain  sizes\nexhibit  non-linearities,  usually  in  the  form  of  a  dip,  so\nthat  the  curve  of  scattering  amplitude  as  a  function  of\nphysical  size  of  the  scatterer  may  not  be  monotonic.\nThus, similar objects with modest variations in physical\nsize  can  scatter  the  same  amount  of  light.    Different\nmaterials  may  exhibit  non-linearities  at  different  sizes.\nBecause  these  effects  tend  to  be  less  pronounced  for\nirregular  particles  such  as  may  be  found  on  polished\nwafer surfaces, instrument calibration is usually carried\nout by avoiding the sizes of spheres that correspond to a\ndip.      Sometimes,   however,   it   is   desired   to   fully\ncharacterize  the  response  of  the  SSIS  to  a  particular\ntype  of  scatterer;  in  this  case,  the  calibration  can  be\ncarried  out  with  a  set  of  particles  with  sizes  that  cover\nthe  desired  range  with  adequate  density  to  ensure  that\nany   non-linearities   in   the   scattering   amplitude-size\ncurve are detected.\n5. 3.14  nominal  sphere  size  distribution  \xf3  the  stated\ndiameter distribution of a suspension of PSL spheres of\na certified diameter used in the calibration of SSISs.\n5. 3.14.1  Discussion \xf3   The   nominal   sphere   size\ndistribution   is   usually   expressed   as   the   standard\ndeviation   or   the   coefficient   of   variation   of   the\ndistribution about the certified diameter.

This related information was approved for publication by full\nletter ballot on November 22, 2002.\nR1-1.1 Both this practice and SEMI M52 introduce the\nnotion   that   SSIS   calibration   should   depend   on   the\ncharacteristics of PSL sphere depositions as they appear\non   the   reference   wafers,   rather   than   the   previous\ntechnique  of  using  the  bulk  characteristics  of  the  PSL\nspheres measured prior to being deposited.  This change\nin philosophy has come about for two reasons.  First, in\nmany  situations,  there  is  actually  some  advantage  to\ncreating  depositions  with  different  characteristics  from\nthose  of  the  bulk  PSL  spheres.    For  example,  the\ndeposition process may be used to narrow the diameter\ndistribution  thus  creating  a  standard  that  more  closely\napproximates  a  source  of  particles  of  a  single  known\nsize.    Secondly,  most  deposition  systems  produce  at\nleast  minor  changes  in  diameter  distributions  that  are\ndifficult  to  eliminate  in  any  case.    As  a  result,  this\nphilosophical change is being introduced to increase the\naccuracy    with    which    SSIS    calibration    can    be\naccomplished.\nR1-1.2   Deposition   systems   generally   consist   of   an\natomizer   (which   takes   the   particles   from   a   liquid\nsuspension  to  an  air  droplet  mist),  followed  by  a  dryer\n(so  that  droplets  of  the  source  liquid  do  not  reach  the\nwafer),   and   often   include   a   bipolar   charger   and\ndifferential  mobility  analyzer  (or  DMA)  to  size  and/or\nfilter the particles.  The changes in characteristics from\nsource  to  deposition  are  due  to  at  least  three  distinct\ncauses.    First,  virtually  all  atomizers  bias  the  diameter\ndistribution  slightly  in  favor  of  smaller  particles.    This\nis because the larger particles do not \xecfit\xee in the smaller\ndroplets  and  as  a  result  have  a  smaller  probability  of\nending  up  in  the  airborne  stream  of  particles  headed\ntowards the wafer.  For narrow source distributions this\nis   not   much   of   an   issue,   but   for   wider   source\ndistributions  it  is.    Secondly,  the  source  liquid  often\ncontains   non-volatile   solids   that   may   dry   onto   the\nparticles,    thus    slightly    changing    their    diameter.\nAlthough  this  is  not  as  important  for  larger  particles\ngreater  than  200  nm,  it  is  highly  recommended  that  a\nPSL  suspension  with  low  non-volatiles  be  used  to\nreduce this source of error.  If the DMA is operated in a\nmanner  that  meets  the  requirement  of  this  practice  for\ndistributions with full width at half maximum (FWHM)\nof no more than 5% of the  peak  diameter,  then  many\nsource distributions are narrowed by the DMA.  This is\ntrue  because  many  PSL  sphere  sources  with  diameters\nless than 200 nm have FWHM values wider than 5% of\npeak  value.    The  5%  FWHM  value  does  not  impose\nsevere difficulties on the DMA design.\nR1-1.3      In   addition   to   narrowing   the   deposition\ndiameter  distributions,  these  standards  address  related\naccuracy   issues.      These   are   easily   understood   by\nconsidering  the  filtering  process  of  the  DMA  on  the\nsource  distribution  as  shown  in  Figure  R1-1.    The  left\nhand  side  of  the  figure  represents  a  rather  broad  PSL\nsource  diameter  distribution.    Notice  that  it  is  not\nsymmetrical,   which   makes   the   mean   (or   average)\ndiameter  different  from  the  modal  (or  peak)  diameter.\nTypically  PSL  manufacturers  have  given  the  mean\ndiameter  with  their  product  and  industry  users  have\nassigned  this  value  as  the  diameter  for  that  deposition.\nUnfortunately  depositions  are  generally  made  at  the\npeak diameter.  This is because the peak is easily found\nby  scanning  the  DMA  through  the  source  distribution\nwhile  counting  the  number  of  particles  passing  the\nDMA.  The center section of the figure shows the ideal\ntriangular  transfer  function  of  the  DMA  fixed  at  some\ncenter  diameter.    By  adjusting  airflows  through  the\nDMA,  the  FWHM  can  be  changed.    By  adjusting  an\napplied voltage, the center pass diameter of the transfer\nfunction  can  be  changed.    In  effect,  the  deposition\ncharacteristics are formed through the multiplication of\nthe  transfer  function  with  the  source  distribution  as\nindicated on the right hand side of the figure.\nR1-1.4   Notice   that   the   shape   of   the   deposition\ndistribution  is  triangular  with  bowed  in  sides,  because\nthe  source  distribution  is  not  flat.    In  effect,  this  is  a\nsafety factor for the 5% FWHM specification.  Because\nthe  source  distribution  is  not  necessarily  symmetrical,\nthe  deposition  distribution  may  not  be  either;  however,\nthe  mean  and  peak  deposition  diameters  will  be  very\nclose because the distribution is relatively narrow."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M53-1103 \xa9 SEMI 2003 10\nR1-1.5  The accuracy of the peak diameter, which is specified to have a relative expanded uncertainty at about 95%\nconfidence  level  as  small  as  possible  but  not  greater  than  3%  in  SEMI  M52,  is  determined  by  either  the  accuracy\nwith  which  the  peak  source  diameter  is  known  (or  can  be  found),  or  by  the  accuracy  of  the  DMA  sweep\nvoltage/diameter  relationship.    Unfortunately  many  PSL  source  bottles  currently  in  use  do  not  give  the  peak\ndiameter,  so  this  presents  a  difficulty  for  the  first  approach.

The  latter\ntechnique is difficult to apply for impurities with atomic\nweight below those of the matrix elements Ga and As.\n5. 15  Deposition of high quality epitaxial layers without\nchemical  pre-cleaning  depends  on  the  surface  oxide\nstructure of the substrate, as prepared by the supplier, as\nwell  as  the  thermal  oxide  desorption  and  the  epitaxial\ndeposition  procedures  of  the  purchaser.    Hence  an\nindividual   supplier-purchaser   specific   evaluation   is\nnecessary.    Test  epitaxy  followed  by  layer  quality\nassessment is recommended.\n5. 16    The  lateral  substrate  homogeneity  is  assessed  by\nautomated    analytic    instrumentation    elaborated    to\ngenerate   topographic   images   of   important   material\nparameters,     including     electrical     resistivity,     EL2\nconcentration,   EPD   and   minority   carrier   lifetime.\nMacroscopic    (e.g.    radial)    variations    as    well    as\nmesoscopic  fluctuations  (generally  correlated  to  the\ncellular  dislocation  structure)  may  be  assessed.    Such\ntopographic   analysis   is   provided,   respectively,   by\ncontactless   capacitive   resistivity   mapping   (see   DIN\n50448),  EL2  absorption  topography  (see  footnote  3),\nspecular       light       reflection       topography       and\nphotoluminescence    topography.        The    first    three\ntopography    techniques    provide    quantitative    data.\nPhotoluminescence     topography     gives     qualitative\nhomogeneity      information      only,      because      the\ninterrelations  between  the  luminescence  intensity  and\nthe  various  radiative  and  nonradiative  recombination\nprocesses  are  only  partially  understood.    The  details  of\nthe  topographic  measurements,  i.e.  lateral  resolution\nand  edge  exclusion,  must  be  defined  by  individual\nsupplier-purchaser agreement.\n5. 17    As  precipitates,  other  inclusions  and  voids  are\nvisualized  with  light  scattering  tomography  (LST).    At\npresent  it  is  not  possible  to  differentiate  between  these\nscattering centers and to obtain quantitative information\nconcerning  their  concentration  and  size.    Hence  LST\nimages provide a qualitative information only.\n5. 18  Micro-roughness,   also   referred   to   as   haze,   is\nindicated by a diffuse reflection of collimated, laterally\nextended  high  intensity  illumination  from  the  wafer\nsurface.      Localized   haze   and   haze   observed   on\nparticular   wafers   of   a   batch   indicate   potentially\ndisadvantageous  variations  of  surface  quality.    The\nagreement should specify the conditions of observation\n(e.g. illumination intensity).\n5. 19  Surface irregularities (stain, scratches, pits, orange\npeel,    dimples)    are    identified    by    high    intensity\nillumination   or   by   standard   and   phase   sensitive\n(Nomarski)   microscopy.      Individual   agreement   is\nrecommended concerning the permitted surface density\nof these defects.\n6  Ordering Information\n6. 1  The  material  properties of  SI  GaAs  substrates,  as\ndescribed  in  Section  4,  are  addressed  in  the  ordering\nagreement   using   the   tables   given   below.      The\nsubdivisions  into  \u201cimportant\u201d,  \u201coptional\u201d  and  \u201cother\u201d\nspecifications   are   suggested   only,   i.e.   supplier   and\npurchaser  may  agree  on  an  individual  choice,  taking\ninto  account  the  respective  application  as  well  as  cost\nconsiderations.\n6. 2        In    addition    to    specifying    individual    material\nproperties  as  listed  below,  the  purchase  order  may\nspecify the fabrication procedures according to Sections\n4. 2 and 4.3.\n6. 3    Substrates  are  usually  delivered  in  batches.    The\nbatch   homogeneity   is   defined   in   the   purchasing\nagreement  by  variation  ranges  of  specified  parameters.\nThe ordering agreement shall also state whether batches\nmust  originate  from  one  ingot  or  may  be  assembled\nfrom  several  specified  or  unspecified  ingots.    In  either\ncase   the   supplier   guarantees   compliance   with   the\nspecified  batch  homogeneity  by  control  of  fabrication\ntechnology and appropriate test sample evaluations.\n6. 4    Table  1  lists  the  parameters  that  are  considered\nimportant to  specify  the  material  quality  of  SI  GaAs\nsubstrates.    The  level  of  importance  may  be  adjusted\nindividually by taking into account the intended use for\nimplantation  or  epitaxy.    The  quoted  absolute  values\nsuggest   a   customary   material   specification,   to   be\nadopted  unless  individual  considerations  warrant  other\nchoices.\n6. 5  Table 2 lists optional parameters that are important\nfor specific applications only, hence may or may not be\nconsidered  relevant  for  a  particular  supplier/purchaser\nagreement.  For  most  of  these  parameters,  standard  test\nmethods at present do not exist.\n6. 6    Table  3  lists  other  parameters  which  in  general\nneed not be specified, but are addressed for clarification\nand to provide a basis for agreement in the event that a\npurchaser  desires  to  include  such  parameters  into  a\npurchasing specification.\n7  Related Documents\n7. 1  SEMI Standards\nSEMI      M1 \u2014      Specification      for      Polished\nMonocrystalline Silicon Wafers"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M54-0304 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2004 6\nSEMI MF523 \u2014 Standard Practice for Unaided Visual Inspection of Polished Silicon Wafer Surfaces\nSEMI MF1241 \u2014 Standard Terminology of Silicon Technology\n7. 2  Other Docs\n5"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"DIN 50443-2 \u2014 Testing of materials for semiconductor technology; recognition of defects and inhomogeneities in\nsemiconductor single crystals by X-ray topography; III-V-semiconductor compounds\nTable 1  Important SI GaAs Material Parameter Specifications and Suggested Standard Values\nParameter           Section                      Wafer\nDiameter\nSuggested ValueUnit Verification\nTechnique\nStandard Test\nMethod\nSection\nCarbon\nconcentration\n4. 7 n.a. 1 \xd7 10\n15\ncm\n-3\nLVM spectroscopy SEMI M30\nDIN 50449-1\n5. 4\nElectrical resistivity 4.11 n.a. >1 \xd7 10\n7"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"\u2126cm\nHall effect\nCapacitive probe\nSEMI F76, M39\nDIN 50448\n5. 5\nElectron mobility 4.12 n.a. > 6000 cm\n2\n/Vs Hall effect SEMI F76, M39 5.6\nEPD of LEC grown\nmaterial\n4. 13         150         mm\n100 mm\n76 mm\n< 1.5 \xd7 10\n5"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"< 1.0 \xd7 10\n5"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"< 1.0 \xd7 10\n5"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"cm\n-2\nStructural etching +\nlight reflection\nASTM F1404,\nDIN 50454-1\n5. 7\nEPD of VGF and\nVB material\n4. 13         150         mm\n100 mm\n76 mm\n< 1 \xd710\n4"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"< 5 \xd7 10\n3"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"< 5 \xd7 10\n3"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"cm\n-2\nStructural            etching,\nlight reflection,\nmicroscopy\nSEMI M36\nDIN 50454-1\n5. 8\nParticles with\ndiameter\n\u2265 300 nm\n4. 17         150         mm\n100 mm\n76 mm\n< 100\n< 40\n< 20\nWafer with\nedge exclusion\nLaser scattering none  5.9\nMicroroughness\n(haze)\n4. 17 n.a. not visible Wafer with\nedge exclusion\nHigh intensity\nillumination\nnone                5.18"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Table 2  Optional SI GaAs Material Parameter Specifications\nParameter                                      Section                                      Verification                                      Technique                                      Section\nAverage EL2\n0\nconcentration 4.5 Optical absorption  5.10\nTotal concentration of impurities acting as\ndonors\n4. 6           GDMS,           SSMS           5.11\nTotal concentration of impurities acting as\nacceptors\n4. 7           GDMS,           SSMS           5.12\nConcentration of boron  4.9 DIN 50449-2, GDMS, SSMS, SIMS, AAS  5.13\nSurface concentration of specified contaminants 4.17 TOF-SIMS, TXRF 5.14\nEpi-ready qualification including shelf life 4.18 Supplier/purchaser specific  5.15\nSurface irregularities (stain, scratches, pits,\norange peel, dimples)\n4. 17 High intensity illumination or microscopic\ninspection (SEMI M15)\n5. 19"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Table 3  Other SI GaAs Material Parameters\nParameter                                      Section                                      Verification                                      Technique                                      Section\nLateral variation of EL2\n0\nconcentration 4.5 Optical absorption topography 5.10\nLateral variation of resistivity  4.11 Transient capacitance, DIN 50448 5.5\nLateral variation of EPD 4.14 Structural etching and light reflection, DIN\n50454-1\n5. 8"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"5 Available from Deutches Institut f\xfcr Normung e.V., Beuth Verlag GmbH, Burggrafenstrasse 4-10, D-10787 Berlin, Germany, website:\n",(0,i.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.din.de"},"www.din.de")),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M54-0304 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2004 7\nNOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for any\nparticular  application.

Bow is a bulk property of the test specimen,\nnot  a  property  of  an  exposed  surface.  Generally,  bow  is  determined  with  a  test  specimen  in  a  free,  unclamped\ncondition.  Units of bow are generally micrometers.\n4. 1.2  crystallite \u2014 any part of the wafer, having an arbitrary orientation of its crystallographic axis in respect to the\nmonocrystalline part of the wafer.\n4. 1.3  dopant \u23af a chemical element, usually from the third or fifth column of the periodic table for the case of IV-\nIV  compounds,  incorporated  in  trace  amounts  in  a  semiconductor  crystal  to  establish  its  conductivity  type  and\nresistivity.\n4. 1.4  edge  contouring \u23af  on  wafers  whose  edges  have  been  shaped  by  mechanical  and/or  chemical  means,  a\ndescription of the profile of the boundary of the wafer joining the front and back sides.\n4. 1.5  edge  exclusion \u23af  the  width  X  of  a  narrow  band  of  wafer  surface,  located  just  inside  the  wafer  edge,  over\nwhich the values of the specified parameter do not apply.  See definition of fixed quality area below.\n4. 1.6  fixed quality area (FQA) \u2014 The central area of a wafer surface, defined by a nominal edge exclusion, X, over\nwhich the specified values of a parameter apply.\n4. 1.6.1  Discussion \u2014 The boundary of the FQA is at all points the distance X away from the periphery of a wafer of\nnominal  dimensions.    (See  Figure  1.)    The  size  of  the  FQA  is  independent  of  wafer  diameter  and  flat  length\ntolerances.\n4. 1.7  lot \u23af  for  the  purpose  of  this  document,  (a)  all  of  the  wafers  of  nominally  identical  size  and  characteristics\ncontained in a single shipment, or (b) subdivisions of large shipments consisting of wafers as above which have been\nidentified by the supplier as constituting a lot.\n4. 1.8  micropipe \u23af  small  hollow  tube  approximately  parallel  to  the  crystallographic  c-axis  and  extending  through\nthe whole crystal.\n4. 1.9  orthogonal  misorientation \u23af  in  {0001}  wafers  cut  intentionally  \u201coff-orientation\u201d,  the  angle  between  the\nprojection  of  the  vector  normal  to  the  wafer  surface  onto  the  {0001}  plane  and  the  projection  on  that  plane  of  the\nspecified direction of tilt in the {0001} plane.  (See Figure 2.)\n4. 1.10  planar  defect\n\u23af  small  cavity  in  a  SiC  bulk  crystal  with  large  width-to-height  ratio  roughly  parallel  to  the\n{0001}  lattice  plane.    The  lateral  boundaries  are  parallel  to  crystallographic  directions.    Often  one  or  more\nmicropipes are connected to a planar defect.\n4. 1.11  polytype \u23af  one  possible  crystallographic  modification  of  a  substance  which  shows  the  phenomenon  of\npolytypism.    All  polytypes  of  a  substance  have  the  same  lattice  layers  with  nearly  the  same  lattice  constant  in\ncommon.    However  the  stacking  sequence  of  these  layers  differs  between  different  polytypes.    Most  commonly\npolytypes are named after a suggestion of Ramsdell\n6\n:  A symbol like 6H gives the number of layers in one periodic\nstacking sequence (2, 3, 4, ... ) and the symmetry of the resulting crystal (H = hexagonal, R = rhombohedral).

While the mechanical dimensions of a wafer can be measured by use of tools such as\nmicrometer calipers and other conventional techniques, the wafer may be damaged physically in ways that are not immediately\nevident.  Special care must therefore be used in the selection and execution of measurement methods.\n8. 1  Test Plan for Crystal Quality within One Crystal \u23af Determine by a method agreed upon between the supplier\nand purchaser.\nNOTE 4:  The assessment of the crystal quality is a problem of great practical impact as it can be very time consuming and costly\nor even impossible in the case of destructive test methods to test every wafer.  However in general crystal quality does not change\nabruptly  in  a  crystal.    The  evaluation  of  a  subset  of  all  wafers  from  a  given  crystal  will  give  sufficient  information  about  the\nquality of the whole crystal.\n8. 2  Polytype \u23af  For  nominally  undoped  material  (n  <  10\n17\n/cm\n3\n)  determine  by  visual  inspection  at  77K  (liquid\nnitrogen) under UV excitation.

ASTM  Test  Method  F1390  is  an  automated,  non-contact\nmethod which provides for correction of the wafer deflection due to gravitational effects. The scan pattern covers the entire fixed\nquality area.  ASTM Test Method F657 is a manual, non-contact method which has a continuous, prescribed scan pattern which\ncovers  only  a  portion  of  the  wafer  surface.    There  is  no  provision  for  correction  of  the  wafer  deflection  due  to  gravitational\neffects. As noted in Appendix 2, different reference planes are used for the two methods.  Because Test Method F657 employs a\nback surface reference plane, the measured warp may include contributions from thickness variation of the wafer.  Test Method\nF1390  employs  a  median  surface  reference  plane  and  is  not  susceptible  to  interferences  from  thickness  variations.    In  general,\nTest Method F1390 is preferred, especially for wafers 150 mm in diameter and larger.\n8. 7  Total Thickness Variation \u23af Determine by ASTM Test Method F657.\nNOTE 6:  ASTM Test Method F533, DIN 50441/1 and JIS H 0611 are all 5 point methods, while Test Method F657 involves a\ncontinuous  scan  pattern  over  a  portion  of  the  wafer  surface  and  Test  Method  F1530  involves  an  automated  continuous  scan\npattern  over  the  entire  wafer  surface.    JIS  H  0611  differs  from  ASTM  Test  Method  F533  and  DIN  50441/1,  in  that  the\nmeasurements  in  JIS  H  0611  are  taken  at  the  center  and  at  5  mm  from  the  edge  on  diameters  parallel  and  perpendicular  to  the\nprimary orientation flat or notch bisector, while the measurements in ASTM Test Method F533 and DIN 50441/1 are taken at the\ncenter  and  at  the  same  radial  distance  (R\nnominal"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"-6  mm)  on  diameters  30\xb0  and  120\xb0  counterclockwise  from  the  bisector  to  the\nprimary orientation flat or notch (with the wafer facing front surface up).\n8. 8  Surface Polarity \u23af Determine by a method agreed upon between the supplier and the purchaser.\nNOTE 7:  There are several destructive and non-destructive methods.  Most common examples are a chemical etch of the surface\n(destructive), by comparing the differently reacting carbon and silicon faces, and wet oxidation (non-destructive) by comparing\nthe different growth rates on both surfaces by measuring the oxide layer thickness.\n8. 9  Flat Orientation \u23af Determine by ASTM Test Methods F847.\n8. 10  Surface Orientation \u23af Determine by ASTM Test Methods F26.\n8. 11  Orthogonal Misorientation \u23af Determined by a method agreed upon between the supplier and purchaser.\n8. 12  Surface Defects and Contamination\n8. 12.1  Visually  Observable  Surface  Defects \u23af  Determined  by  ASTM  Practice  F523  or  a  method  agreed  upon\nbetween the supplier and purchaser.\n8. 13  Edge Contour \u23af Determine by ASTM Test Method F928.\n8. 14  Resistivity \u23af For conductive wafers determine by ASTM Test Method F43 or ASTM Test Method F673.

This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot\nprocedures on September 3, 2003.\nR1-1  Introduction\nR1-1.1  In  general,  when a  single  characteristic  on  an\nitem  is  measured  once  on  a  single  gauge  and  100%\nsampling  is  employed,  the  model  will  take  the  form\ndescribed in this practice.\nR1-1.2    If  the  situation  is  more  complex,  the  nature  of\nthe  model  will  be  different.    Factors  that  can  affect  the\nnature of the model include the following:\n\u2022 number    of    items    examined    (lot    acceptance\nsampling vs. 100% sampling),\n\u2022 number  of  times  an  item  is  inspected  (single  vs.\nmultiple),\n\u2022 effect   of   the   inspection   process   on   the   item\n(destructive vs. non-destructive),\n\u2022 number   of   item   characteristics   examined   for   a\nsingle decision (one vs. many), and\n\u2022 cost    functions    associated    with    the    business\ndecisions (fixed vs. variable).\nR1-1.3  In addition, it is possible to have more than one\nset  of  cost  functions  for  each  type  of  item  that  is\ninspected  by  the  metrology  system.    Because  much  of\nthis is context specific, it would be impossible to cover\nall  possible  models.    Other  extensions  to  the  model\ninclude   relaxation   of   the   assumption   of   constant\nvariance, the introduction of variability in the bias, and\nthe  use  of  guard  banding.    The  foundation  of  all  these\nextensions, however, is the use of\n\u03b1 and \u03b2.\nR1-2  Extension to Multiple Gauges\nR1-2.1    To  extend  the  model  to  multiple  gauges,  one\nmust make the additional assumption that all measuring\ngauges are measuring the same characteristic.\nR1-2.1.1    In  addition,  define  a  conforming  item  as  one\nthat  all  gauges  show  the  measured  characteristic  to  be\nin specification.\nR1-2.1.2    A  non-conforming  item  is  taken  to  be  one  in\nwhich   at   least   one   gauge   shows   the   measured\ncharacteristic to be outside of specification.\nR1-2.2    It  is  then  possible  to  define  a  set  of\n\u03b1  and  \u03b2\nerror  rates  for  each  gauge.

In\ngeneral,  there  are  two  probabilities  that  are  of  interest.\nThe  first  is  the  probability  of  getting  a  measurement\noutside  of  the  specification  range  for  a  conforming\nitem.    This  is  often  called  the  producer\xeds  risk  because\nconforming product would be needlessly rejected in this\nsituation.    The  second  probability  is  that  of  getting  a\nmeasurement     within     specifications     for     a     non-\nconforming  item.    Consumer\xeds  risk  is  the  term  applied\nto  this  probability,  since  there  is  a  chance  of  non-\nconforming product being accepted.\nR3-1.1    For  the  purposes  of  this  standard,  the  event  of\nrejecting  an  item  whose  true  value  lies  inside  of  the\nspecification  limits  is  considered  a  Type  I  error  with\nerror rate (probability)\n\u03b1.\nR3-1.2    The  event  of  accepting  an  item  whose  true\nvalue   lies   outside   of   the   specification   limits   is\nconsidered  a  Type  II  error  with  error  rate  (probability)\n\u03b2.\nR3-1.3      One   of   the   difficulties   in   formulating   the\nstatistical   model   is   that   there   are   two   or   more\ndistributions  involved,  possibly  in  an  interdependent\nfashion.    Given  a  true  underlying  (fixed)  value,  x,  a\nsingle  measurement  of  that  value  produces  the  obser-\nvation Y = x + U,  where  U  is  a  random  and  unobs-\nervable  value  attributable  to  measurement  variability.\nIf  one  takes  n  measurements  of  the  same  value  x,  i.e.,\nY\ni\n= x + U\ni\n,  where  i = 1,\xd6, n, Y  and  U  are  treated  as\nrandom     variables     from     the     observation     and\nmeasurement    variability    distributions,    respectively.\nThe  situation  is  further  complicated  if  several  x  values\nare measured.  In this situation, the x values come from\nthe  process  (or  characteristic)  distribution  X such  that\nY\nij\n=  X\nj"),(0,i.yg)("ul",null,(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"U\nij\n,  where  i = 1,\xd6, n  and  j = 1,\xd6, m.

Additional  distributions  may  be  involved\nif   one   assumes   that   certain   characteristics   of   the\nmeasurement  process  do  not  remain  constant  over  the\nmeasurement range.
