SEMI E98-1102 © SEMI 2000, 2002 20 AbstractEquipmentSubsystem held atMaterialLocation Materialprovides AbstractEquipmentModuleEquipmentSubsystem Figure 10AbstractEquipmentSubsystem Subtypes 10.4 AbstractEquipmentSubsystem Object10.4.1 The AbstractEquipmentSubsystem is a subtypeof AbstractEquipmentElement and inherits all of itsattributes and services. It may have associatedMaterialLocations to hold Material.AbstractEquipmentSubsystem represents all subsystemand subassembly components of which the equipmentis made up. The AbstractEquipmentSubsystem may ormay not be capable of holding material and may or maynot have recipe execution capability.10.4.2 Figure 10 shows the relationships of theEquipmentSubsystem.10.4.3 Material Object10.4.3.1 An AbstractEquipmentSubsystem may or maynot be able to hold material. Those that are able to holdmaterial owns any material that it holds at any givenpoint in time. They are expected to know the type ofmaterial that they hold, whether material is present, andthe identifier of the material. In some cases, theAbstractEquipmentSubsystem may be able to holdmultiple units of material or more than one type ofmaterial.10.4.3.2 There are three major subtypes of materialobjects: consumables, durables, and substrates, wherethe major subtypes of durables are carriers and processdurables.10.4.3.3 Consumable materials, such as chemicals, areused up (as opposed to worn out) during themanufacturing process.10.4.3.4 Durable material has a significant lifetime andis not part of the equipment (is removable). It includesmaterial that some equipment may require to operate.The subtype of durable of common interest to almost allequipment is carrier. A carrier is a durable used to holdsubstrates. Process durables are of special interest to alimited subset of equipment. A process durable is anidentifiable durable that is specified for a certainprocess step and recipe. For example, reticles are identified by product id and the mask level where used,and they are also identified by serial number. Thefactory is very interested in the management andtracking of process durables.10.4.3.5 Product is typically a Substrate. In thesemiconductor industry, Substrates include Wafer, Die,and Leadframe. Reticles are considered a Substrate bysome equipment. In the semiconductor industry,reticles are considered as a process durable rather than aproduct. Specific reticles are specified in recipes forexpose tools and modules. In other industries,substrates include flat panel (for flat panel displays) anddiscs (for hard disk drives).10.4.3.6 Material objects are not formally defined inOBEM. Carrier objects are defined in SEMI E87(CMS) and substrate objects are defined in SEMI E90(STS).10.4.4 Material Locations10.4.4.1 A material location is a place that is capable ofholding material.10.4.4.2 A MaterialLocation is an abstraction used tofacilitate the tracking of material without regard to thephysical component associated with the trackinglocation. For example, a substrate chuck is a subsystemand can hold a single substrate on its surface. Theentire subsystem consists of a stage that may or may notbe able to move. It may use vacuum to hold thesubstrate in place, and it may have additionalmechanisms and sensors. The MaterialLocation onlyrepresents the surface of the chuck. For this reason, theEquipmentSubsystem is said to provide aMaterialLocation rather than to be made up ofMaterialLocations through aggregation.10.4.4.3 This relationship is illustrated in Figure 11.10.4.4.4 The MaterialLocation object is an abstracttype. Figure 11 shows the subtypes ofMaterialLocations of interest to OBEM.

Note this is identical to MaterialID in the general case forMaterialLocation.10.4.5 AbstractEquipmentSubsystem Requirements10.4.5.1 AbstractEquipmentSubsystems may or may not be able to hold material.10.4.5.2 The AbstractEquipmentSubsystem owns all of the MaterialLocations that it provides or that are providedby one of its components.

Thesupplier may restrict this service to specific AbstractEquipmentElement subtypes, both in destination (theAbstractEquipmentElement accepting the addition) and in the added element. This is an optional service.

SEMI E98-1102 © SEMI 2000, 200223 10.4.8.1.2 A typical kind of AbstractEquipmentElement that the user may want to add is an add-on sensor, aSensorActuatorDevice on a Sensor/Actuator Network. If the Equipment knows the properties, it is possible for it toread an added I/O device and to reference it within recipes.10.4.8.2 Remove Element  The user may instruct the equipment to remove an AbstractEquipmentElement thatwas added earlier. This service is required wherever the Add Element service is supported.10.4.9 EquipmentSubsystem Object10.4.9.1 The EquipmentSubsystem is a concrete subtype of AbstractEquipmentSubsystem. It inherits all of theattributes, state models, and services of the AbstractEquipmentSubsystem and in addition defines the rules foraggregation. These rules are illustrated in Figure 14.

SEMI E98-1102 © SEMI 2000, 2002 24 10.5.1 As shown in Figure 15, an AbstractEquipment-Module is a type of AbstractEquipmentSubsystem thatrepresents a higher level of complexity and is of greaterimportance to the factory. It is mainly intended torepresent process modules but may be used for othermajor intelligent subsystems capable of supporting therequirements for the AbstractEquipmentModule. It maybe possible in some cases for the physical module tooperate independently from the equipment.10.5.2 The AbstractEquipmentModule has twosubtypes, Equipment and EquipmentModule.10.5.3 ProcessMatching10.5.3.1 ProcessMatching provides one or moremechanisms for managing process differences betweentwo or more identically configured subsystems of thesame type to ensure that a generic recipe run on bothsubsystems will achieve the same process result.ProcessMatching may be either internal or external orboth. 10.5.3.2 An example of an external method would bethrough provision of a ProcessMatching object thatallows a user to manipulate offsets to processparameters. This can be done through setting parameteroffsets for each subsystem so that, within specifiedconstraints, all subsystems of the same type give thesame process results. More sophisticated systems mayuse algorithms to determine process offsets based onmathematical models and module history.10.5.3.3 As a simple example of process matching,three different individual hotplates may be matched forthe temperature range 225275°C by modifying theirtemperature offset by 1°C, 1.75°C, and 2.1°Crespectively. This approach is illustrated in Figure 16.10.5.3.4 The equipment supplier is responsible fordetermining the set of parameters to which offsets maybe applied as well as the range of values that are valid.

SEMI E98-1102 © SEMI 2000, 200225 10.5.3.5 These parameters may be the same as thosereferenced within recipes for Recipe Variable Para-meters. 6 In this case, Recipe Variable Parameters aregiven as setpoints that can be based on characteristicsof the incoming substrate and are hardware indepen-dent, while Parameters used in Process-Matching arerelative (applied to an existing setpoint) and are used tocompensate for hardware differences. Support of bothRecipe Variable Parameters and ProcessMatching para-meters allows the user to compensate for hardware-specific differences separately from product-specificdifferences. The number of cycles since the last pre-ventive maintenance performed on a process moduleaffects its performance in a certain way, while the effectof too thin a film on the wafer will affect requirementsin a different way.10.5.3.6 The ProcessMatching object here is shown asan example. This is not a standardized object.10.5.3.7 Internal methods of process matching may useother techniques, such as special types of recipes.10.5.4 AbstractEquipmentModule Requirements10.5.4.1 The AbstractEquipmentModule inherits theattributes, state models, and services of both theAbstractEquipmentElement and the AbstractEquip-mentSubsystem. As a type of AbstractEquipmentSub-system, the AbstractEquipmentModule is also able tohold one or more units of material.10.5.4.2 The AbstractEquipmentModule representsmajor subsystems, such as process chambers. Itsupports basic operational commands: start, stop, pause,resume, and abort.10.5.4.3 ARAMS10.5.4.3.1 When implementing SEMI E58, theAbstractEquipmentModule shall provide complianceexcept as qualified in this section. The Abstract-EquipmentModule is the smallest component ofequipment for which SEMI E58 (ARAMS) statesshould be maintained.10.5.4.3.2 An AbstractEquipmentModule that can notbe powered off separately from Equipment is notrequired to provide its own powerdown estimate or timeof last powerdown.10.5.4.3.3 Otherwise, an AbstractEquipmentModuleimplementing SEMI E58 shall comply with therequirements of Section 13, Object ServicesCompliance, in SEMI E58, including all of theattributes defined in Table 6, ARAMS Object AttributeDefinitions in that document. These attributes are notrepeated in OBEM. The user may change the ARAMS 6 Variable Parameters are defined in SEMI E42. state. In some cases, a change in the ARAMS state of amodule may cause an ARAMS state change for theequipment. The supplier shall document anyrelationships between the ARAMS state of theEquipment and the ARAMS states of its modules.10.5.4.4 AbstractEquipmentModule Service States For implementations of ARAMS, to be consistent withSEMI E10, the AbstractEquip-mentModule is INSERVICE whenever it is in an uptime state. Otherwise,it is OUT OF SERVICE, as it can not be scheduled formanufacturing. To change the service state of anAbstractEquipmentModule, the user must change itsSEMI E10 (RAM) state. Note that the service state ofsome modules will affect the service state of Equipmentas well.10.5.4.5 Clock  For modules able to operateindependently of the equipment (e.g., modules with adedicated CPU), AbstractEquipmentModules arerequired to have individual clocks. It is the responsi-bility of the Equipment to synchronize multiple internalclocks.10.5.4.6 Process Type10.5.4.6.1 An AbstractEquipmentModule has a ProcessType that indicates its primary functionality as one ofthe following: Process, Measurement, Transport, orStorage. This is represented as a text string that mayspecialized further as needed.10.5.4.6.2 The AbstractEquipmentModule has one ormore ProcessCapabilities. ProcessType and Process-Capability are used for high-level and detailed processcharacterization. The user may add and removeProcessCapability descriptions through operations AddProcess Capability and Remove Process Capability.10.5.4.7 Process Matching10.5.4.7.1 All AbstractEquipmentModules supportingRecipe Execution shall provide one or more methodsfor process matching.10.5.4.7.2 ProcessMatching allows the AbstractEquip-mentModule to be tuned for a specific set of conditionsin order to achieve the same results as other Abstract-EquipmentModules with the same process capability.10.5.4.8 Process Setup10.5.4.8.1 AbstractEquipmentModules capable of per-forming different processes may need to be re-configured following one process before a process of adifferent type can be executed. Examples of setuprequirements include: a new reticle for a stepper, asource change for an ion implanter, or a significantchange in temperature for a furnace.

&lt;!-- Page 11 --&gt;

SEMI E98-1102 © SEMI 2000, 2002 26 10.5.4.8.2 Both process recipes and service recipesmay be associated with specific setups.10.5.4.8.3 Recipes of the class /SETUP/ may be usedto put the AbstractEquipmentModule into a specificstate. The user uses the name of the setup forscheduling work. This is captured in the attributeProcessSetup.10.5.4.9 Recipes10.5.4.9.1 An AbstractEquipmentModule may providerecipe execution services and the ability to accept,store, verify, select, and run Execution Recipes (SEMIE42). This ability is required for AbstractEquipment-Modules with a ProcessType of Process or Measure-ment. Where provided, recipes and recipe executionshall comply with the fundamental requirements for theExecution Recipe and Recipe Executor as specified inSEMI E42 (RMS).10.5.4.9.2 Some equipment performs its process inthree stages, which can be characterized as preamble,main process, and postamble, where the preamble ispreparation for the stable part of the process, and thepostamble takes care of the transition from the stablepart of the process until it is ready to unload thematerial. In a furnace, for example, the preamble couldinclude both the period where it is ramping to attain thesetpoint temperature and the gas flow setpoints. Afourth stage is sometimes defined to handle abnormalterminations.10.5.4.9.3 From a recipe standpoint, these differentstages can be represented as different sections of a single recipe or as separate recipes linked to a mainrecipe.10.5.4.10 Mechanical Dry Run10.5.4.10.1 The AbstractEquipmentModule shallsupport the capability to do a mechanical dry run. Thisallows the material handling subsystems and softwarefunctions to be exercised and tested without requiringfull process hookups and without using processconsumables. Typically this is done through a speciallydesignated recipe that allows time settings and does notuse settings for temperature, gases, plasmas, water, etc.In some cases, it may require a recipe of a special class,such as /DRYRUN/. Environmental subsystems suchas vacuum, nitrogen purge, particle detectionsubsystems, etc. must be allowed to function normallyduring a mechanical dry run.10.5.4.10.2 Dry runs shall be prohibited during theARAMS Manufacturing state.10.5.4.10.3 Certain types of tools may need to modifythe definition of the mechanical dry run to addressspecial issues in a way that still satisfies the objectives.Equipment documentation shall specify the methodused to satisfy this requirement.10.5.5 AbstractEquipmentModule State Model10.5.5.1 The AbstractEquipmentModule inherits theOperational State Model of the AbstractEquipment-Subsystem. In addition to the concurrent substates ofSERVICE, the AbstractEquipmentModule adds theBEHAVIOR state. Figure 17 shows the OperationalState Model with its two concurrent substates.

It should remove anymaterial in process within the module wheneverpossible to do so safely.10.5.7.1.2 A module may also self-abort when itdetects a dangerous condition.10.5.7.1.3 In the Behavior State Model, the moduleshall transition from ACTIVE SERVICE toABORTING when an abort occurs. When all activityhas ceased other than normal background activities forenvironmental control, the module transitions toABORTED. The module shall not start a new activityuntil it is instructed to do so by the user or the userinstructs it to return to IDLE.10.5.7.2 Add Process Capability  ProcessCapabil-ityList is an attribute of the equipment module and con-sists of a list of text strings representing process capa-bilities that are meaningful to the user. Individual capa-bilities are added by the factory to recognize the type ofprocesses the equipment module may be able to run.10.5.7.3 Pause10.5.7.3.1 On receipt of a Pause request from the user,the module shall suspend its activity at the next logicalpoint in the process from which it will be able toresume activities at a later time and which will preventunintended change to the product. It shall not acceptnew work while it is in this state.10.5.7.3.2 In many cases, to avoid unintended changeto the product, the AbstractEquipmentModule shouldwait until the current product has been removed andthen pause, preventing new product from entering.10.5.7.4 Remove Process Capability  This allows thefactory to remove from the ProcessCapabilityList acapability that is no longer required or one that can notbe performed by the equipment due to environment oractual physical changes in the equipment.10.5.7.5 Resume  When a Resume request is receivedduring a PAUSE state, the module shall resume itsactivity from the point where it was paused.10.5.7.6 Shutdown  The Shutdown request is used toput an AbstractEquipmentModule in a state where it issafe to turn off its power and remove it from theequipment.

Equipment is the root object within the equipmenthierarchy. Equipment may not be a component of any otherAbstractEquipmentElement or any of its subtypes. Equipment may be made up of any standardizedobjects except for other Equipment objects. Equipment is required to have a Clock. Equipment is required to have at least oneCarrierPort. Exceptions to this requirement may bemade for testers and for exposure equipment in alinked litho cell that have separate communicationswith the factory systems. Equipment is responsible for (owns) all of itscomponents 10.6.4 Clock Object10.6.4.1 Clock represents current real-time date andtime of day information. This information may beprovided by a physical real-time clock or by othermethods of calculating time. The Clock is used totimestamp data and events.10.6.4.2 Requirements include: The user shall be able to read the current date andtime at any time. Equipment shall be capable of using both factorynetwork time services and user interface services toset current date and time. Clock resolution shall be 0.01 seconds or smaller. Date shall maintain a four-digit year.

SEMI E98-1102 © SEMI 2000, 2002 32 10.6.4.5 Network Time10.6.4.5.1 It shall be possible to set current date and time by using time services provided by the network in thefactory. Use of network time allows the different systems within the factory to remain closely synchronized with ahigh degree of accuracy, and it relieves the factory host from explicitly setting the equipments clock. The attributeUseNet allows the user to enable and disable use of network time services.10.6.4.5.2 When enabled, the equipment shall be responsible for ensuring that any change in time does not result indiscontinuities in date/timestamp reporting. For example, if the time changes in the middle of a process, applyingthe time change to current process events can cause later events to appear earlier than previous events, or they cangive the appearance of large pause in activities during processing. Both of these cases can cause time-based analysisof data to give wrong results and must be prevented.10.6.4.6 Timestamp Data10.6.4.6.1 Date/time information is used by the factory for a variety of purposes, including analysis of historicaldata. Typically a factory keeps local time. GMTDelta, the offset between local time and Greenwich Mean Time, isprovided to allow time values to be compared outside of the local time zone. GMTDelta may also be added to thetimestamp to clarify time data when local time changes within a process.10.6.4.6.2 The attribute TimestampFormat allows the user to select the format used for timestamping events.Possible formats include: formatted time, a text string of the form YYYYMMDDhhmmsscc, long signed integer,and floating point.10.6.5 Equipment Attributes Equipment AssignedOperatorsEqpName Cleanup Figure 23Equipment Object 10.6.5.1 Table 15 defines the attributes of the Equipment object, as shown in Figure 23.Table 15 Equipment Attribute DefinitionsAttribute Name Definition Access Reqd FormObjType Object type RO Y Text=EquipmentObjID Object identifier RO Y TextAssignedOperators Currently assigned operators.

Given the number of Process Jobs thatare defined during the course of a work shift and their temporary nature; it is unlikely that an operator willdifferentiate easily between one Process Job and another. Whereas they will be able to more quickly identify anindividual module or the Equipment when time is a critical factor.

SEMI E98-1102 © SEMI 2000, 200233 10.6.6.3 Operational Services10.6.6.3.1 Abort  The user may direct the Equipmentto abort its operations at any time. The Equipment shallstop all activity as soon as possible while maintainingthe safety of the product, the Equipment itself, andpeople. Product is not returned to the carriers.10.6.6.3.2 Cleanup  When product is left in theEquipment following an abort operation, it may benecessary to request the Equipment to return allsubstrates to their carriers.10.6.6.3.3 Pause  The user may request theEquipment to pause its operations. The Equipment isresponsible for determining the appropriate pointswithin its process where it is safe to temporarily stop.As with the Stop command above, the multi-moduleEquipment may direct individual EquipmentModules toPause one at a time.10.6.6.3.4 Resume  This command directs theEquipment to resume normal operations from thePAUSED state.10.6.6.3.5 Start  The Start command directs theEquipment to begin an activity that is already setup andready. Its use is not intended for automatic processingby Equipment providing Process Job capabilities.10.6.6.3.6 Stop  The user may direct the Equipmentto stop activity at any time. The Equipment shall beresponsible for ensuring that all of its components stoptheir activities in an orderly fashion at the firstopportunity. Processing shall be completed for all workin process (e.g., substrates that have already beenremoved from their input carrier), but no processingshall be started for remaining work.For Equipment with multiple EquipmentModulesperforming individual process steps in a sequence ofsteps, a Stop command to the Equipment is equivalentto issuing a Stop command to the firstEquipmentModule in the sequence, followed bysubsequent Stop commands to each EquipmentModuleonce it has accepted the substrate last started. 10.6.6.4 Time Services  This section describes theservices provided by the clock.10.6.6.4.1 Request Date and Time  The user shall beable to read the equipments current date and time as anumeric value. 10.6.6.4.2 Set Date and Time10.6.6.4.2.1 If UseNet is disabled, the user shall beable to set the current date and time as a numeric value.Note that this method does not generally give goodsynchronization results.10.6.6.4.2.2 Set Date and Time shall not cause adiscontinuity in timestamps for data associated with anindividual substrate in process.10.6.6.4.3 Request Formatted Date and Time  Theuser shall be able to read the equipments current dateand time as a formatted text string.10.6.6.4.4 Set Formatted Date and Time  If UseNetis disabled, the user shall be able to set the current dateand time as a formatted text string. Note that thismethod does not generally give good synchronizationresults.10.6.6.4.5 Synchronize Date and Time  The user mayrequest the equipment to synchronize date and timefrom the network as soon as it can do so withoutdisrupting the timestamp series for any work in process. 11 OBEM Equipment Functional Requirements11.1 The functional areas of the equipment aredescribed in the Functional View in Section 8.3.Section 11 defines the requirements for each of thesefunctional areas.

SEMI E98-1102 © SEMI 2000, 200235 11.3.1 Timestamp Data  Date/time information isused by the factory for a variety of purposes, includinganalysis of historical data. Should time changesignificantly during processing, the assumed orderingof events can be affected so that later events appearearlier, large unexplained gaps can appear in a sequenceof events, or data can seem to appear from the past. Forthese reasons, any change in current time shall not beapplied to material in the middle of a process.11.3.2 Date/Time Values  Date and Time informationshall be expressed as a numeric value.11.3.3 Local Time Change  Where local timechanges automatically, the equipment is responsible formaintaining the correct difference between local timeand Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in the Clockattribute GMTDelta.11.3.4 Optional Timestamp Format  The equipmentshall provide an option for the user to include the valueof GMTDelta as an additional field in timestamps. Theuser may enable and disable use of GMTDelta bysetting and clearing the Boolean Clock attributeUseDelta.11.4 Equipment Control  Control is divided intoseveral areas: Fault Detection Control, Run to RunControl, Material-Control, and Operational Control.Control of each of these four areas shall be assigned toexactly one user at any point in time. However, thatuser may be the same for one or more of these areas.11.4.1 Advanced Process Control (APC)  Twocategories of APC are described herein: run-to-runcontrol (between lots, carriers, or substrates), and fault-detection control. Support for APC may be required atthe EquipmentModule level.11.4.2 Run-to-Run Control (R2R)  The factory maydedicate a separate session for Run-to-Run Control.Run-to-run control consists of adjusting VariableParameter settings of Process Recipes within a processjob.11.4.3 Fault Detection Control (FDC)11.4.3.1 Fault detection is able to detect a probablefault before it can be detected by SPC, equipmentfailure, or product failure. The user may provide faultdetection through analysis of process data inconjunction with data from external sensors.11.4.3.2 A separate dedicated session may be used forfault detection control because of its need for largeamounts of data. FDC may instruct the Equipment toput itself into a downtime state as soon as it completeswork currently in process. 11.5 Event Management  Equipment shall providestandard mechanisms for notifying the user of events ofinterest to the user, together with any data the user hasassociated with specific events.11.6 Exception Management  The equipment shallcomply with SEMI E41 (EMS).11.7 Job Management  This section is reserved forrequirements related to specifications for managingjobs.

To achieve this, equipment loadports must be standardized for access bydifferent material handling technologies such as overhead tracks and rail-guided vehicles in addition to personal-guided vehicles (PGVs) used by operators.

SEMI E98-1102 © SEMI 2000, 2002 44 R1-2.2 In addition to issues regarding access, users require that equipment be capable of continuous processing.

SEMI E98-1102 © SEMI 2000, 2002 46 RELATED INFORMATION 2RELATIONSHIP TO THE CIM FRAMEWORK NOTE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E98. This is Related Information for the provisional specificationand is not intended to modify or supersede the official standard. Determination of the suitability of the material is solely theresponsibility of the user.This section discusses the relationship of OBEM andthe OBEM objects to the objects defined in SEMI E81.It uses terms both from the CIM Framework and fromOBEM. It is not part of the OBEM standard.Additional documentation should be provided in thissection as the CIM Framework develops. R2-1 Equipment and MachineR2-1.1 The interface to Equipment defined in OBEMis provided for the physical equipment on themanufacturing floor. From time to time, the Equipmentwill be powered off for maintenance and at these timesis unable to communicate. In contrast, the Machineobject, defined in the CIM Framework, is part of themanufacturing execution system and is alwaysavailable, even when the Equipment is powered off orotherwise unable to communicate.R2-1.2 The Machine provides a generic interface forfactory logistics and is able to provide some serviceswithout relying on the Equipment itself. The Machineis responsible for communications with the Equipmentand for representing the Equipment to the Factory andrepresenting the Factory to the Equipment. R2-2 EquipmentModule and MachineResourceR2-2.1 The EquipmentModule defined in OBEMcorresponds to the MachineResource interface definedin the CIM Framework. The MachineResource is a typeof Resource and therefore can respond to requests tostart up and shut down. These services are provided forthe EquipmentModule but not for its supertypes. R2-3 Location TrackingR2-3.1 The CIM Framework defines an interface for aMaterialTrackingLocation. The MaterialTracking-Location differs from the OBEM MaterialLocation.MaterialLocations represent places within theequipment itself where carriers and substrates can beplaced, including wafer chucks, carrier slots, and robotend effectors. A MaterialTrackingLocation, in contrast,is at a higher level of granularity and provides theability to locate material associated with a Machine.MaterialTrackingLocation does not track materiallocations down to the level of specific places within theequipment.

This is Related Information for the provisional specificationand is not intended to modify or supersede the official standard. Determination of the suitability of the material is solely theresponsibility of the user.This section provides examples of equipment models to clarify the standard.This section contains additional information that is not part of the standard. R3-1 Representations of Date and TimeR3-1.1 This section discusses several date and time representations, and provides background information insupport of the OBEM adoption of an IEEE floating point representation of date and time values.R3-1.2 In this section, the term date value means an encoding of a date and time value, such as 12/25/199711:04:56.R3-1.3 ASCII Digit RepresentationR3-1.3.1 The standard date and time format in SECS communication is the ASCII representationYYYYMMDDhhmmsscc. In this representation, date and time are represented as a fixed length sequence ofASCII digit characters, grouped into fields as indicated. Advantages DisadvantagesVery simple conversion to display format. Date computations difficult. For example, adding two datevalues is not a trivial operation.Simple to extract date and time from date value. Many digit sequences are not valid date values.The format does not lend itself to expressions of timeintervals. The representation of ten minutes might be00000000001000, but the job of adding this interval to adate value is not simple.The resolution of the representation is fixed at seconds. R3-1.4 Long Signed Integer RepresentationR3-1.4.1 UNIX represents date and time as the number of ticks since Epoch. Typically the time interval of a tick isone second. Date values are expressed as the number of ticks since a certain instant, called the Epoch.R3-1.4.2 There are 31,536,000 seconds in a 365 day year. If stored as a four byte signed integer, with ticks inseconds, this representation will overflow after approximately 68 years. Eight byte integers provide sufficient rangefor dates spanning human history many times. Unfortunately, eight byte integers are inconvenient on manycomputer platforms. Advantages DisadvantagesAll bit sequences are valid date values. Difficult to separate date and time from date value.Intervals are simple to express. Eight byte representation required for sufficient range, butinconvenient on many computer platforms.Date value arithmetic is simple. No simple way to convert date value to display format.The resolution of the representation is fixed at the tick value,typically seconds. R3-1.5 Floating Point RepresentationR3-1.5.1 This representation is used in many applications. It represents date values as floating point numbers, withunits of days past 12/30/1899. It is very similar to the Ticks since the Epoch representation, except that the tickvalues are days.

&lt;!-- Page 33 --&gt;

SEMI E98-1102 © SEMI 2000, 2002 48 R3-1.5.2 This representation has the advantages of the Tick since Epoch representation for date value arithmetic.Second, the separation of the date and time from a date value is simple. The date is the whole value, the time is thefractional value. Third, the minimum time resolution is very small, and is not fixed by the representation.R3-1.5.3 The following calculation is used to determine roughly the minimum time resolution that can beexpressed:R3-1.5.4 The IEEE 8 byte floating point representation uses an excess 128 notation. This means 7 bits of exponentand one bit of sign. This leaves 7 bytes of significant. On November 18, 1997 the day number is 35752. This ishex 8BA8, and requires two bytes. This leaves 5 bytes of significant to represent the fractional day, or the timeportion of the date value. These 5 bytes of significant contain 40 bits, and can represent values to 2^40, or one partin 1,099,511,627,776. There are 86,400 seconds in one day, so this representation is accurate to approximately7.86E-08 seconds, or about 1/10 of a microsecond. In about a hundred years the day number will have doubled, andthis resolution will have shrunk by a factor of 2. For practical purposes the resolution is no worse than onemicrosecond resolution. Advantages DisadvantagesAll legal float values are valid date values. Minimum resolution changes over time.Simple to separate date and time from a date value. No simple way to convert date value to display format (butsimpler than the Tick since the Epoch representation).Intervals are simple to express.Date value arithmetic is simple.The eight byte floating point representation used is supportedon most computer platforms.The time resolution is not implied by the representation, butis valid to very small intervals.

SEMI E98-1102 © SEMI 2000, 200249 RELATED INFORMATION 4OBEM EQUIPMENTIODEVICE AND SENSOR/ACTUATOR NETWORKCOMMON DEVICE MODEL NOTE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E98 and was derived from work developed in the Object-BasedModel Task Force in North America, and the Sunsor/Actuator Bus subcommittee. This related information was approved forpublication by full letter ballot on April 30, 2001. R4-1 Relationship between OBEMEquipmentIODevice and Sensor/ActuatorNetwork Common Device ModelR4-1.1 This section describes the relationship betweenthe EquipmentIODevice defined in Section 10.3 and theCommon Device Model defined in SEMI E54.1Standard for Sensor/Actuator Network CommonDevice Model.R4-1.2 SEMI E54.1 defines in detail the internalstructure of a sensor/actuator device on an E54-compliant sensor/actuator network. That is, it definesthe possible internal components of such a device andthe relationships between these components. To ensureproper behavior, it was necessary to give sufficientguidance to implementers using an E54 networkcommunication protocol. E54.1 defines sensor (input)objects, actuator (output) objects, controller objects, asensor/actuator controller object (SAC), and a devicemanager object (DM) as individual components of asensor/actuator device aggregation as components of anaggregate Common Device Model (CDM). The deviceaggregation must have at least one sensor or actuator orcontroller (combined) and exactly one SAC and oneDM. In addition, the CDM defines additional classes tofurther classify components, such as the ActiveElement,Sensor, and Sensor-Analog Input classes, which shouldbe considered. Some attributes of theEquipmentIODevice Observables only apply toelements of certain classes.R4-1.3 E54.1 does not define the CDM, which is theaggregation of these elements, as an object in its ownright,. Such an aggregation might have the sum of all ofthe attributes of its components.R4-1.4 OBEM defines a high-level device, theEquipmentIODevice, that is of interest to factory system applications such as Advanced Process Control(APC) and Fault Detection Classification (FDC). Thesesystems are seldom interested in all of the low-leveldetails. Actual raw data as read directly by an analogsensor may not be desired but rather a calculated valuethat has been converted into some specified units, suchas degrees Celsius. OBEM can support either.R4-1.5 Some of the attributes of theEquipmentIODevice are maintained only by theequipment. Most of the attributes must come directlyfrom the attributes read from the CDM components forE54.1 compliant devices. The following sectionssuggest a way to relate attributes of theEquipmentIODevice and attributes of the elements fromthe CDM in a consistent manner.R4-1.6 Each individual sensor or actuator or controllerelement within the CDM corresponds to oneObservable in the EquipmentIOElement model.Observables were not made into formal objects, as theycould be, but rather are included as one set of datawithin the EquipmentIODevice. EachEquipmentIODevice may have multiple sets ofObservables data.R4-1.7 Table R4-1 lists all of the attributes of anEquipmentIODevice, including those it inherits fromthe AbstractEquipmentElement (marked with asterisks)and shows the object and attribute in the GeneralDevice Model hierarchy to which it corresponds, wherea correspondence exists.R4-1.7.1 The em dash character is used whereno correspondence exists.R4-1.7.2 This table is intended for equipmentimplementers of E98 and not for the suppliers of E54-compliant devices.

SEMI E102-0600 © SEMI 20001 SEMI E102-0600PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION FOR CIM FRAMEWORK MATERIALTRANSPORT AND STORAGE COMPONENT This provisional specification was technically approved by the Global Information and Control Committeeand is the direct responsibility of the Japanese Information and Control Committee. Current edition approvedby the Japanese Regional Standards Committee on March 14, 2000 and by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on March 2, 2000. Initially available at www.semi.org March 2000; to be publishedJune 2000. 1 Purpose1.1 Wafer fabrication factories wil l require thebaseline capabilities of stocker storage and interbaytransport. In addition to these baseline capabilities,intrabay transport will be added as a result ofergonomic and safety requirements brought about bythe increased size and weight of 300 mm wafer carriers.These stocker, interbay transport, and intrabay transportsystems will be required to be fully integrated with eachother and the factory Manufacturing Execution System(MES) in order to realize the full vision of costeffective automated material transport to and fromproduction equipment.1.2 A baseline requirement of Aut omated MaterialHandling System (AMHS) equipment is efficientintegration with the factory MES. Therefore, thepurpose of this specification is to enable cost effectiveintegration of interoperable AMHS systems, asillustrated in Figure 1. Manufacturers require a SEMIstandard which specifies the visible behavior of theAMHS Integration system and its interface to thefactory MES. The purpose of this standard is to specifythese interfaces and the interactions between MES andAMHS systems as a part of the CIM Framework. Whilethe term AMHS is commonly used to refer to a widerange of equipment and systems that support automatedmaterial handling, the CIM Framework specifies asoftware component called Material Transport andStorage Component (MTSC) which represents thestandard interface of the MES to the complete suite ofAMHS capabilities. 2 Scope2.1 This specification provides the common interfacesrequired by Manufacturing Execution Systems forruntime interactions between the factory (as representedby other CIM Framework components) and theMaterial Tracking and Storage Component. Someinterfaces supporting configuration and tracking of thematerial transport and storage equipment are theresponsibility of the Equipment Tracking andMaintenance component of the CIM Framework. Theseinterfaces are complementary to the interfaces of Transport Machines and Storage Machines presented inthis specification.2.2 The responsibilities of the Mat erial Transport andStorage Component include interfaces that Support scheduling of material transport andprocessing by predicting time for material deliveryto specific locations. NOTE: The interfaces fordelivery time prediction are deferred as one of thedeficiencies noted in this provisional specification. Execute and monitor transport jobs to movematerial to specific locations. Validate that the job can be done: the materialis available, the destination is reachable andhas available storage or loadport capacity, andthere are sufficient material movementresources (cars, storage space, etc.) toimplement the job. Request operations from AMHS equipmentcontrollers to enact internal material move-ment and storage actions. Implementations ofthe Material Transport and Storage Compo-nent will use lower level standards such asIBSEM and StockerSEM for communicationwith equipment that performs the physicalmovement and storage actions. Collect and record data on transport jobexecution and history. Capture, record, interpret, and respond toequipment events and fault detection. Generate MES-level job status events andmaterial location change events. Record and report on material locations andmaterial transport histories for material in thesystem. Interact with machine and port interfaces formaterial hand-off handshake protocols.2.3 Automated Material Handling Systems (AMHSs)are an important part of any semiconductor factory andhave, typically, been implemented and integrated with a

An AMHS is made up of theAMHS Framework, the system controllers for AMHSequipment (the software) and the transport and storagemachines (the hardware). In keeping with this tradition,the CIM Framework views the AMHS as a black boxwhere the interface into that system is visible, but theinner workings and control of that system is theresponsibility of the AMHS supplier and not in thedomain of the MES. The CIM Framework specifies the Material Transport and Storage Component (MTSC) asthe MES level interface to AMHS capabilities.2.4 This specification does not pur port to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this specification toestablish appropriate safety and health practices anddetermine the applicability of regulatory limitationsprior to use.

This level of materialtransport is factory level movement, i.e., the transportof product and durables between machines, areas ormaterial tracking locations. The Material Tracking andStorage Component does not provide interfaces thatmake material movement within machines visible.3.2 Provisional Status  This spe cification isdesignated as provisional due to known areas that needto be completed. The following items summarize thedeficiencies of the provisional specification to beaddressed before a subsequent ballot to upgrade it tofull standard status.3.2.1 Dependence on Global Declar ations andAbstract Interfaces  Components of this documentreference global declarations and specialize abstractinterfaces for material, resource and job concepts. Theprovisional specification for these declarations andinterfaces was balloted and recommended by the SEMIInformation and Control Committee in July, 1999.When this specification is published a revision will beundertaken to clearly define the relationship of thisspecification to those common elements of the CIMFramework.3.2.2 Dependence on Durables Man agementComponent  The Material Transport and StorageComponent depends upon interfaces specified as part ofthe Durables Management Component of the CIMFramework. This document includes only the requiredinterfaces from Durables Management. Thoseinterfaces, found in Section 6.2.3, will be removed fromthis document when the Durables ManagementComponent of the CIM Framework is adopted in afuture ballot.3.2.3 Dependence on Machine Abstr act InterfaceGroup  The Material Transport and StorageComponent depends upon interfaces specified as part ofthe Machine Abstract Interface Group (Machine AIG)of the CIM Framework. This document includes onlythe required interfaces from the Machine AIG. Thoseinterfaces, found in Section 6.2.4, will be removed fromthis document when the Machine AIG of the CIMFramework is adopted in a future ballot.3.2.4 Dependence on Factory Opera tions Component The Material Transport and Storage Componentdepends upon interfaces specified as part of the FactoryOperations Component of the CIM Framework. Thisdocument includes only the required interfaces from theFactory Operations Component. Those interfaces,found in Section 6.2.5, will be removed from this document when the Factory Operations Component ofthe CIM Framework is adopted in a future ballot.3.2.5 Deterministic Prediction of Tra nsport Time The responsibility for providing estimates of predictedtransport time of future TransportJobs in a deterministicway is beyond the scope of the ProvisionalSpecification. This capability may be offered in futureupgrades of this specification based on addedexperience with such predictions. It may be found thatheuristic methods for transport time prediction are themost practical way to provide such estimates. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI DocumentsSEMI E81  Provisional Specification for CIMFramework Domain Architecture 4.2 Other DocumentsISO/IEC International Standard 14750 (also ITU-TRecommendation X.920): Information Technology Open Distributed Processing  Interface DefinitionLanguage 1 UML Notation Guide, Version 1.1, document numberad/97-08-05, Object Management Group 2 5 Terminology5.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms5.1.1 AMHS  Automated Material Handling System5.1.2 MTSC  Material Transport a nd StorageComponent 6 Requirements6.1 The following sections specify the interfaces thatcomprise the Material Transport and StorageComponent of the CIM Framework.

The Material Transport and StorageComponent uses services provided by the Machine AIGto access interfaces of Machines and Ports that serve asthe source or destination of Transport Jobs. The MESFactory defines areas within a factory which representgroups of machines. Finally, Durables Managementprovides the services needed to manage the materialcontainers that are moved.6.1.2 Figure 3 shows the Material T ransport andStorage Component information model, including theinherited interfaces and the associations betweeninterfaces. These interfaces are fully defined in Sections6.3 and 6.4. The interfaces associated with the MaterialTransport and Storage are as follows:1. TransportJobSupervisor  abstract interface,2. MaterialTransportManager,3. MaterialTransportController, and4.

They areincluded with this document to support a completespecification for AMHS support within the CIMFramework.
