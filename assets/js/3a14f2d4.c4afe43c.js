The  problem  of  measuring\nfeature sizes on photomasks or integrated circuit wafers\n(e.g., linewidth) is complicated by the fact that a feature\nis   a   3-dimensional   object   whose   exact   shape   is\ngenerally not known. The metrology problem is further\ncomplicated when the object is microscopic and only its\nmagnified image can be measured.\n4. 2    Feature  measurement  data  are  usually  reduced  to\none  or  a  few  parameters  because  the  additional  data\nneeded to describe the complex actual feature shape are\nseldom   available   and   may   be   immaterial   to   the\nsubsequent application of the measurement data.\n4. 3  The first rule of metrology is to define exactly what\nis  to  be  measured.  The  approach  used  here,  in  light  of\nthe   previous   paragraphs,   is   to   construct   a   simple\nidealized geometric shape, or feature model (Figure 1),\nwhich  approximates  a  real  object  of  complex  shape.\nThis  model,  whose  size  and  center  position  are  well\ndefined, is substituted for the real feature in application\nof  the  measurement  data.  A  model  can  be  refined  to\nbetter  approximate  the  actual  feature  shape  by  adding\ndegrees   of   freedom,   requiring   more   parameters   to\ndescribe the measurement. For example, a line might be\nrepresented  by  a  rectangular  cross  section  (with  width\nand height) or better represented by a trapezoidal cross\nsection  (with  base  width,  height,  and  two  wall  angles).\nThe differences between the model and the actual shape\nof  the  feature  contribute  to  the  overall  measurement\nuncertainty of the size or position of that feature."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"1 American National Standards Institute, Headquarters: 1819 L\nStreet, NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA.

These models are abstractions of the\ncomplex   realities   they   represent,   a   simplification\nusually required in order to make the modeling tractable\nand  the  measurement  practical.  The  output  model  of\nthis  metrology  process  is  the  feature  model  (Section\n5. 5.4) with the metrology results attached, including the\nassociated    measurement    uncertainty.    Measurement\nuncertainty  arises  from  inevitable  differences  between\nboth the process and feature models and their respective\nrealities.  The  measurement  error  (Section  5.10)  is  the\ndifference  between  the  measurement  result  and  the\nunknown  true  value,  and  the  measurement  uncertainty\n(Section  5.11)  is  expressed  as  a  confidence  interval\nrepresenting  the  variance  of  the  measurement  errors.\nThe   measurement   uncertainty   includes   components\nfrom  model  infidelity  in  addition  to  scale  calibration,\nrepeatability,  environmental  factors,  etc.  A  confidence\ninterval  of  95%  (or  2\u03c3 for  normally  distributed  errors)\nis    used    in    the    examples,    in    accordance    with\ninternational custom.

In  particular,  if  that  process  is  wafer\nexposure,   then   the   same   feature   model   for   the\nphotomask  features  can  be  used  for  both  the  mask\nmetrology and exposure processes:"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"exposure model \u2295 photomask feature model\n\u2192 wafer feature model."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"A1-1.3      Errors   and   uncertainties   in   the   photomask\nfeature model propagate through the exposure model to\nbecome  manufacturing  errors\u2014differences  between  a\nwafer feature\u2019s size or placement and its target value\u2014\nand   manufacturing   uncertainties.   In   analogy   with\nmeasurement  uncertainty,  tolerances  on  wafer  features\nencompass  mask  measurement  uncertainties,  including\ndifferences  between  the  models  and  their  respective\nrealities,   as   well   as   the   effects   of   tolerances   for\nexposure parameters and photomask features. The mask\nerror  enhancement  factor  (MEEF)  and  other  optical\nproximity   effects   are   good   examples   of   the   wafer\nexposure  model  operating  on  photomask  feature  size\nand    placement    variations    to    produce    nonlinear\nvariations  in  wafer  feature  size  and  placement  under\nsome conditions.\nA1-2  Real   microlithographic features (Section   5.5)\noften  have  irregular  shapes  and  rough  edges;  it  is\nneither  possible  nor  necessary  to  know  the  exact  shape\nof a feature to be measured. The purpose of the feature\nbounding boxes (Section 5.1) defined here is to account\nfor such edge details as top-to-bottom runout and along-\nthe-line  irregularities  that  are  often  observed.  In  such\ncases  the  bounding  boxes  help  define  the  measurand\n(Section  5.9).  To  the  extent  that  such  details  are  not\nknown,  not  relevant,  or  too  complex  to  be  considered,\nthe bounding boxes represent the feature with a simpler\ngeometry  and  mix  these  disregarded  details  into  the\nmeasurement uncertainty. For the ideal line with known\nedge  geometry  and  no  edge  irregularities,  the  inner,\nmean,  and  outer  linewidth  bounding  boxes  (Sections\n5. 8.3\u20135.8.5) can be identical and the line edge bounding\nbox (Section  5.6)  can  have  zero  width.  The  bounding\nbox approach simplifies metrology issues for the quasi-\nthin-film        features        often        encountered        in\nmicrolithography.    Extension    of    the    concept    to\nstructures  with  nonplanar  top  surfaces  or  extending\nbelow the reference plane (Section 5.14) becomes more\ncomplicated.\nA1-3    A  great  deal  of  flexibility  has  been  incorporated\ninto  some  of  these  definitions.  This  is  because  the\ndefinition  of  a  measurand (Section  5.9)  can  depend  on\nthe  purpose  for  which  a  measurement  is  made,  and  the\nmeasurement  error  depends  on  the  definition  of  the\nmeasurand.  It  is  up  to  the  user  to  specify  or  define  the\nmeasurand in a way that suits his present purpose and in\nan  unambiguous  way.  Otherwise  interpretation  of  the\nmeasurement    result    may    be    in    error    and    the\nmeasurement   uncertainty   may   be   meaningless   or\nimpossible   to   ascertain.   In   other   words,   the   \u201ctrue\nvalues\u201d  of  feature  edge  positions,  centerline (Section\n5. 3), centroid (Section  5.4),  and  linewidth (Section\n5. 8.1),   can   depend   on   the   purpose   to   which   the\ncorresponding    measurement    results    are    put.    The\ndefinitions given here allow for some flexibility so they"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI P35-0704 \xa9 SEMI 2000, 2004 8\ncan be made consistent with the ultimate purpose of the\nmeasurements.\nA1-4    The  inner  and  outer  linewidth  bounding  boxes\nneed not have the same shape, but their widths must be\nunambiguously  defined.  A  rectangular  shape  for  both\nwill   result   in   a   centerline,   centroid,   and   linewidth\nindependent of height above the substrate, but may also\nresult  in  a  larger  interval  between  the  inner  and  outer\nlinewidth bounding boxes.

Default values for these\nassume the edge is equally likely to be anywhere inside\nthe line edge bounding box. In that case the expectation\nvalue  of  the  line  edge  location  is  the  center  of  the  line\nedge  bounding  box  (i.e., the  linewidth  is  the  width  of\nthe mean  linewidth  bounding  box  ","[Section  5.8.3]","),  and\nthe  edge  position  uncertainty  (at  the  95%  confidence\nlevel) is 0.577 \xd7 width of line edge bounding box. The\ncorresponding linewidth    measurement    uncertainty\n(Section 5.8.7) component is 0.816 \xd7 width of line edge\nbounding   box   if   the   right   and   left   edge   location\nuncertainties are uncorrelated, and 1.154 \xd7 width of line\nedge  bounding  box  if  they  are  mirror-image  correlated\n(as  is  often  approximately  the  case).  See  reference\nSection 3.2, page 13.\nA1-6    In  most  cases,  the  width  or  centroid  or  edge\npositions  of  the  bounding  box  is  measured  from  its\nimage  in  a  metrology  tool;  inferring  the  width  of  the\nbounding    box    from    this    image    usually    requires\nmodeling  of  the  image-forming  process.

Magnification  error  is  caused  by\nvariation   of   the   equipment   conditions   such   as   the\nsampling  pitch  and  incident  angle  of  electron  beam.\nPattern-edge   determination   error   is   affected   by   the\nmanner     of     measurement     such     as     pattern-edge\ndetermination     algorithm     used     and     pattern-edge\ndetermination parameters used, and the properties of the\nspecimen such as pattern topography (e.g., pattern-edge\nslope) and pattern material.\nA1-4      Magnification   error,   including   inter-machine\nmagnification   error,   can   be   detected   and   corrected\nthrough  measuring  pitches  of  reference  patterns,  and\npattern-edge  determination  error  could  be  detected  and\ncorrected  through  measuring  widths  of  the  reference\npatterns  practical  reference  patterns  are  available  for\nmeasuring  their  widths.  However,  it  seems  extremely\ndifficult   to   produce   practical   reference   patterns   for\nmeasuring  their  widths;  the  source  of  the  problem  lies\nin  the  physics  of  electron  beam  image  formation  and\nnot   because   the   reference   patterns   are   somehow\ninadequate   because   of   the   following   reasons:   (a)\nreference pattern can not be determined uniquely, since\nintensity profiles obtained are different from each other\ndependent  on  pattern  topography  and  pattern  materials\neven if the width of every reference pattern is the same,\n(b) it is technologically difficult to solve the problem of\nwidth  change  due  to  the  contamination  which  changes\nthe  measurement  value  of  pattern  width  dependent  on\nmeasurement time.\nNOTICE: SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or\nrepresentations  as  to  the  suitability  of  the  guideline  set\nforth   herein   for   any   particular   application.
