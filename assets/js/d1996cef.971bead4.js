Description Language5.1.5 XML  eXtensible Markup Language5.2 Definitions5.2.1 UML (Unified Modeling Language)  a notation for representing object-oriented designs and views createdby Booch, Rumbaugh, and Jacobson in order to merge their three popular notations plus aspects of other existingnotations into a single object-oriented notation intended to be usable by all.5.2.2 XML (eXtensible Markup Language)  a markup language used for representing data rich with context andcontent in documents and in communications. XML is an extension of SGML, a document-oriented markuplanguage. It was created by W3C for use on the Internet. 6 Conventions6.1 Translating UML to XML Schema6.1.1 The reader is expected to have a working knowledge of the UML, XML, WSDL, SOAP, and Schemaspecifications (see 4.2 and 4.3). This document does not provide tutorial information on these subjects.6.1.2 This document follows the guidelines for XML as outlined in SEMI E121.6.1.3 Some of the key guidelines followed in this document are summarized here: Attributes of UML classes from SEMI E125 are generally represented as XML attributes, to improve efficiencyin transferring metadata descriptions from the equipment. Exceptions to this convention are UML attributesthat correspond to data structures or other constructs that cannot be represented as XML attributes, or mayinclude text values that may need to include non-parsed character data (CDATA). Composition associations are mapped to a single XML element (or multiple such elements if the specifiedmultiplicity is greater than 1)."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 2 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E125.1-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2005 6  Aggregations are mapped to contained elements or arrays of references to one or more unique attributes of thetarget type. Inheritance is modeled using complexType extension. In cases where a reference to an abstract base classoccurs in the UML model, a choice compositor for each of the possible derived types is used in order to restrictinstance documents from including arbitrary extension through type substitution.6.1.4 The translation of a UML class to XML Schema types is documented using a table format illustrated byTable 1. Operations defined for a UML class are translated into WSDL operations.6.1.5 Translation Table Column Header Description Attribute or Role Name  If an attribute, the name of the attribute is placed here. If an association (includingaggregation or composition), the role name from the UML diagram is placed here. Compositions are often notassigned role names. In that case none is placed here. UML Name/Type  If an attribute, the data type of the UML attribute is placed here. If an association, the typeof association is placed here. The possible association types are Composition, Aggregation, or the basicAssociation. UML defines these three types of association. XML Element or Attribute  Lists the type of XML construct used to represent the UML attribute orassociation. XML Name/Type  Provides the name and data type of the resulting XML construct. The type may be a built-in type (for example, xsd:string), or a named type defined within the XML Schema.Table 1 Example Translation Table Attribute or Role Name UML Name/Type XML Element or Attribute XML Name/Typefriend association element Friend: HumanReferenceArrayemployees aggregation element Employees: HumanArrayfamily composition element Family: HumanArrayname string element Name: xsd:string 6.1.6 Translating Operations to XML Schema6.1.6.1 The translation of an operation defined for UML interface classes to XML Schema types is documentedusing a table format illustrated in Table 2. One row is provided for each possible input/output argument for theoperation being described.Table 2 Example Translation Table for Operation Input/Output Arguments Argument Name Format XML Element or Attribute XML Name/Type 6.2 Documenting XML Schema and WSDL Files6.2.1 Associated with this document are XML Schema and WSDL files that are core components of thespecification.

Although no standard graphical notation for XML Schema could be found, various XML tools havetheir own notation. This document will use the notation provided by XMLSpy from Altova Corporation. Figure 1shows a sample XML Schema diagram that will be used to provide a basis for explanation of the schema graphicalnotation used in the rest of the document.6.3.2 In the diagram, rectangular boxes represent XML element definitions. Ownership or containment is read fromleft to right in the diagrams. In the sample diagram, ParentType contains Child1, Child2, Child 3, and Child 4. Inturn, Child2 contains Child2a, Child2b, and Child2c. The additional symbols (8-sided boxes) represent sequences orchoices. See Table 4 for an explanation of these symbols.Table 4 Altova XMLSPY Schema Diagram SymbolsDenotes a required ordered sequence of the right hand elements with a cardinality of onefor each element. (sequence)Denotes an optional ordered sequence of the right hand elements with a cardinality ofone for each element. (sequence)Denotes a required, but unordered, sequence of the right hand elements with acardinality of one for each element. (all)Denotes a required choice of the right hand elements. Exactly one or two of the righthand elements must be present. (choice) Denotes an element that contains parsed character dataDenotes a reference to a group or element defined elsewhere 6.3.3 A graphic using a solid line is a required element; using a dashed line represents an optional element.Numbers or ranges in the lower right hand corner represent cardinality. The default cardinality is one.6.3.4 To simplify a diagram or help focus on a particular aspect, detail may be hidden. The 8-sided symbols have asmall square on the right end. If a minus sign - is in the box, then all detail is shown. If the box contains a plussign +, then all detail to the right of that symbol is hidden. The example has no hidden detail.6.3.5 The yellow (or grey if printed in monochrome) boxes indicate the use of other defined types. So, Child4 is oftype Child4Type. Child4Type defines Child4a and Child4b. This detail may be hidden in the diagram. Objectoriented inheritance is typically represented in XML as type extension. In Figure 1, ParentType extends Child1and2Type by adding a sequence that includes Child3 and Child4.6.3.6 Reading Figure 1 would yield the following additional information:1. Child1and2Type is an ordered sequence of two items: Child2 and Child1.2. Child1 contains an optional ordered sequence of Child1a, one or more Child1b, and (optionally) Child1c.3. Child2 contains a choice of one or two of the following: Child2a, Child2b, and Child2c.4. Child3 contains an unordered sequence of Child3a and Child3b.6.4 XML Schema Sample6.4.1 The sample XML Schema for the example shown in Figure 1, is presented below.

WSDL bindingdefinitions for each portType are used to specify the SOAP 1.1 envelope contents for each operation, and to definethe corresponding XML encoding styles and HTTP header usage. All SEMI E125 WSDL interfaces usedocument/literal encoding, with the complete SOAP header and body contents defined in XML Schema file(s) viaglobal element definitions.7.1.2 Figure 1 shows the relationship between the WSDL binding and portType definitions and the XML Schematypes used for each interface.

Once enabled via SEMI E132.1, the equipment shall require mutual client-server SSL authenticationfor all SEMI E125 operations supported by the equipment, and the equipment shall not provide access to anyoperations except via the HTTPS transport.7.2.2 There may be some integration, development, and/or test environments in which it is not practical or feasibleto install equipment and/or client certificates in order to communicate with the equipment. As a practicalconsideration for such environments only, the equipment shall support the ability of the user to disable SSLauthentication for the SEMI E125 EquipmentMetadataManager interface, using the equipment configurationspecified by SEMI E132.1. Users should be aware that disabling SSL authentication opens up complete unrestrictedaccess to SEMI E125 data for any application with network access to the equipment.7.2.2.1 Regardless of whether or not SSL authentication is enabled, the equipment shall reject all requests fromclients that do not provide a valid SEMI E132 session identifier in the SOAP envelope header provided with therequest. The SEMI E132 session identifier shall be provided via the SEMI E132 Header element, as specified bySEMI E132.1. If a client does not provide a recognized session identifier, the equipment shall immediately rejectthe request using the SEMI Common Error data type, with an error code of 6005 and a source of urn:semi-org:E132 as specified in SEMI E132.1.

In this case, the Parameter belongs to the same source (the same SEMIObjType) thatimplements the StateMachine, so a relative reference can be used.7.2.11.5.5.2 source  This attribute is optional and shall be either not present (relative reference) or present and setto a valid CEM Locator (absolute reference) identifying the equipment node that provides the referenced Parameter.If not present, the source is inferred by the context that the reference is made (either a SEMIObjType or anequipment node).7.2.11.5.5.3 name  For relative references to Parameters provided directly from an equipment node orSEMIObjType, this attribute shall be set to the value of the name attribute of the Parameter that is referred to. Forabsolute references to Parameters provided directly from an equipment node, this attribute shall be set to the value ofthe name attribute of the corresponding Parameter. For absolute references to SEMIObjType attributes or eventdata Parameters provided from a specific equipment node, this shall be a string of the form urn:semi-org:objType::objAttr:, where  is the ObjType name, and is the name of the Parameter representing the attribute or event data.7.2.11.5.5.4 Some examples of valid Parameter references are shown in the following table.Table 55 Example Parameter ReferencesAbsolute /Relative Referring Source Referenced Source Referenced Parameter Name relative SEMIObjTypedefinition PRJobState relative Equipment Node  MeasuredTemperatureabsolute Equipment Node Equipment/Oven/RTD-1OvenTemp absolute Equipment Node Equipment urn:semi-org:objType:ProcessJob:objAttr:PRJobState 7.2.11.5.6 EventToParameterMapType  This global complexType is the XML Schema representation of theSEMI E125 EventToParameterMap class.Table 56 SEMI E125 EventToParameterMap  EventToParameterMapType Translation TableAttribute or Role Name UML Name/Type XML Element or Attribute XML Name/TypeeventId text attribute eventId: xsd:stringdescription text element Description: xsd:stringavailableParameters Structured data of typeParameterelement AvailableParameter:esd:ParameterReferenceType(zero or more, see 7.2.11.5.5 fordescription of Parameter references)"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 27 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E125.1-0305 \xa9 SEMI 200531 7.2.12 GetExceptions7.2.12.1 This section is provisional, pending approval of SEMI E132.1 and SEMI E138.7.2.12.2 WSDL Operation Binding7.2.12.2.1 See the operation binding for GetExceptions in E125-1-V0305-EqpMetadataMgr-Binding.wsdl.

Originally published July 2003; last published July 2004. 1 Purpose1.1 This standard identifies key equipment quality information parameters, or EQIPs, for equipment process typesor groups. The identification of these quality parameters is intended to help equipment users and suppliers specifyand utilize capabilities for process control.1.2 This standard is designed to be updated as EQIPs are identified for new and/or existing equipment process typesin this standard.1.3 Intended Audience  This standard is intended for use by OEMs, users, and third party equipment and processcontrol system suppliers who need to achieve equipment and process control of select process quality parameters,utilizing standardized methods for actuation of process control parameters. 2 Scope2.1 The scope of this standard is limited to identifying key EQIPs for select equipment process types, specifyingthat the equipment shall indicate a non-null list of settable process program parameters that impact each of theseEQIPs, and specifying that the equipment shall allow individual actuation of each of these parameters using SEMIstandard methods. The standard is not intended to identify all quality parameters. It is not intended to specify acomplete set of equipment types.2.2 While this standard requires that a capability shall exist for actuation of process program parameters toinfluence key EQIPs, the standard does not specify how this actuation will take place. For example, it does notdefine the communication protocol for actuation or the equipment or host models that will support and enable thisactuation capability. The scope is limited to defining the key EQIPs and their linking to process programparameters.2.3 The standard is structured so that EQIPs for equipment types may be added to an existing set, as the communityreaches consensus on these additions. Further, EQIPs may be defined for a new equipment type not previouslyaddressed in this standard. Additions to the standard are made utilizing the SEMI standards balloting process.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 The standard is structured so that EQIPs for equipment types may be added to an existing set, as the communityreaches consensus on these additions. Further, EQIPs may be defined for a new equipment type not previouslyaddressed in this standard. Thus, this standard does not necessarily specify a complete EQIP set for an equipmenttype, and does not necessarily address all equipment types.3.2 This standard does not specify how actuation of equipment settable process program parameters associated withthese EQIPs will take place.

Specifically, an EQIP is a parameter of measure on a wafer that relates to the quality of thewafer, i.e., the closeness of the wafer to a design specification or the performance of the device being produced.EQIPs may be measurable directly or indirectly. EQIPs do not have to be measured at the process tool. EQIPs mayalso be referred to as process quality parameters.5.1.2 PPP (Process Program Parameter)  a parameter in the preplanned and reusable portion of the set ofinstructions, settings, and parameters under control of the equipment that determine the processing environment seenby the manufactured object and that may be subject to change between runs or processing cycles.5.1.3 R2R ControlRun-to-Run Control  techniques for varying settings in one run based on analysis of eitherincoming product (feedfoward) or product from an earlier run (see SEMI E98). In this document, R2R Control isfurther defined as a form of discrete process control in which settable process attributes are adjusted, generallybetween process runs, to better achieve selected process quality targets.5.2 Definitions5.2.1 equipment type  a categorization or grouping of equipment based on capability, method of operation, effecton wafer, etc. The boundary of the type should be aligned with a generally perceived categorization of equipment inthe industry.5.2.2 linked process program parameter  an equipment process program parameter that can be altered to effectchange of an EQIP with which it is associated. 6 Background6.1 Equipment processes can generally be categorized or grouped into types. An equipment or equipment processcan be associated with one of more types. Further, each type can be associated with a finite set of quality parametersthat relate to the quality of process on the wafer. These process quality parameters are a function of tunable processinputs as well as external uncontrollable conditions, as shown in Figure 1.6.2 Control solutions can provide a capability to improve process quality parameters by suggesting changes totunable input parameters. Standards are needed to identify control capabilities for equipment. Specifically, astandard is needed to specify these quality parameters so as to guide the use of metrology and process programmodification to support capabilities such as run-to-run (R2R) control."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 44 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E126-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 20053 Equipment Process TypeProcess Inputs(e.g. time) Process Quality Outputs(e.g. Thickness) ExternalsEvents Consumables Other Tunable Parameter Not Tunable Equipment Process TypeProcess Inputs(e.g. time) Process Quality Outputs(e.g. Thickness) ExternalsEvents Consumables Other Tunable Parameter Not Tunable Figure 1Equipment and Process Quality Parameters(note that, in the figure, EQIPs are Process Quality Outputs and Linked Process Program ParametersPPPsare Process Inputs that are tunable according to SEMI defined standard methods) 7 Equipment Type Organization7.1 This standard categorizes semiconductor equipment into types according to functionality, effect, and oroperational characteristics.
