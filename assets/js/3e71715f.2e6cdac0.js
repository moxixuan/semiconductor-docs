The\nceiling height of the room where the loading equipment\nis installed has to be designed accordingly.\n6. 2.1.3  A   suggested   method   for   loading/unloading\nsubstrates  from  the  shipping  case  with  an  automatic\nvertical  loader/unloader  is  to  tilt  the  box    as  shown  in\nFigure  7.  Align  the  substrates  on  one  side  of  the  clear-\nance of the mizo and proceed with loading/unloading.\n6. 2.1.4    An  alternative  method  for  loading/unloading\nwould  be  to  rotate  the  packing  box  90\xb0,  as  shown  in\nFigure 8.\n6. 2.1.5    Loading  and  unloading  the  substrates  also  can\nbe    done    manually    without    using    an    automatic\nloader/unloader.\n6. 2.2  Packing Box Size\n6. 2.2.1  The shorter side of the substrate (side W, or the\n800  mm  side)  as  the  vertical  direction  (direction  z  in\nFigure  5)  during  shipping.  This  way,  the  size  of  the\nsubstrate  determines  the  inside  measurements  of  the\npacking  box,  H:  800  mm  (direction  z),  W:  950  mm\n(direction x).\n6. 2.2.2    The  outside  measurements  of  the  packing  box\nshall  be  H:  980  mm  \xd7  W:  1,200  mm  \xd7  L:  <\n1100mm\n(Figure 5). It is important to note that the height of 980\nmm indicates that it is possible to stack up the packing\nboxes,  i.e.  980  mm  \xd7  2  =  1,960  mm,  and  still  be  less\nthan  the  possible  maximum  height  (2,000  mm)  of  the\ntruck load.\n6. 2.2.3  The length of the packing box is determined by\nthe  calculated  product  of  the  pitch  size  between  the\nsubstrates  times  the  number  of  substrates  stored  in  the\nbox.  the  length  (L  in  Figure  5)  of  the  packing  box\ncannot exceed 1,100 mm\n6. 2.3  Packing Box Lid\n6. 2.3.1    The  packing  box  must  prevent  the  substrates\nfrom getting contaminated as well as to give pressure to\nthe  substrates  for  securing  them  from  both  top  and\nbottom. The lid must securely seal and be able to latch\nclosed  to  the  packing  box  by  a  lock.  The  latching\nmechanism must allow easy automatic lock and unlock\nas well.\n6. 2.3.2    The  lid  shall  also  have  automatic  and  manual\nopening/closing  capability.  The  inside  of  the  lid  is\ncovered  with  a  shock  absorber  that  functions  to  secure\nthe  glass  substrates  by  pressing  them  from  the  top  and\nbottom.\n6. 2.4  Mizo Pitch and Capacity of Packing Boxes\n6. 2.4.1  The sag, h4 = 20 mm will be for the substrates\nof the size 800 \xd7 950 \xd7 0.7 mm as shown in Appendix\n3,  when  a  sudden  turn,  acceleration,  or  braking  during\nshipping forces a 1G acceleration against the substrates.\nFrom  this  point  of  view,  the  pitch  required  here  is  a\nlittle  bit  larger  than  20  mm.    However,  since  all  the\nsubstrates in the box are affected by the acceleration at\nthe  same  time  and  in  the  same  direction,  the  distance\nbetween   the   substrates   will   remain   constant   which\nmeans the substrates should not touch each other.\n6. 2.4.2    The  mizo  pitch,  must  be  standardized  by  each\nshipping case supplier, but must range from a minimum\nof 9 mm to a maximum of 22 mm \xb1 0.2 mm.

The detail of the position and size\nof  the  reference  surfaces  shall  be  standardized  to  use  a\ncompatible  reference  for  two  different  design  boxes.\nAlso   the   center   line   of   substrate   is   automatically\ndefined  by  symmetrical  location  between  substrate  and\nreference plane of case.\n6. 2.7  Transfer and Lift Method for Packing Boxes\n6. 2.7.1    It  is  expected  that  not  only  boxes  containing\nglass  substrates  but  also  empty  boxes  are  fairly  heavy.\nAt  least,  they  probably  cannot  be  carried  by  hand.\nTherefore,  it  is  assumed  that  whether  the  box  contains\nglass  substrates  or  not  and  whether  the  box  is  in  a\nregular  room  or  a  clean  room,  it  shall  be  lifted  by  a\nforklift  and  transferred  mechanically.  To  accommodate\na mechanical transfer and lift, skids must be installed at\nthe  bottom  of  the  box  so  that  the  forklift  can  insert  its\ntongues  underneath  the  box  (see  Figure  5).  The  height\nof the skids shall be standardized for each shipping case\nsupplier, but not exceed 150 mm.\n6. 2.7.2  Assuming lifting of the box and short distance,\ntransfer  is  done  using  a  balancer;  the  packing  box  is\nrequired to have handles, as shown in Figure 12, on the\nsides  of  the  box.  The  structure  of  the  handles  shall  be\ndesigned  in  such  a  way  that  it  does  not  hinder  the\nreference plane.\n6. 2.8  Packing Box Strength\n6. 2.8.1  The weight of the contents of the box, with the\nprescribed number of substrates, can be calculated from\nthe  density  of  substrates.  The  packing  box  has  to  be\nstrong  enough  to  bear  that  weight.  Moreover,  it  has  to\nbe  strong  enough  to  hold  another  full  box  on  top  of\nitself.\n6. 2.8.2    Stacking  three  boxes  with  glass  substrates  is\nprohibited.  Therefore  there  is  no  need  for  the  packing\nbox  strength  to  hold  two  boxes  on  top  of  one  box.\nHowever,  empty  boxes  may  be  stacked  three  high,  but\nthe  box  has  to  be  designed  to  bear  the  weight  of  two\nempty boxes.\n6. 2.8.3  The handles shall be strong enough to hold the\nweight  when  the  box  is  filled  with  glass  substrates  as\nwell as a full box on top or two empty boxes on top.\n6. 2.9  Packing Box Material\n6. 2.9.1  Packing  box  material  is  not  covered  in  this\ndocument.

This is done with four alignment targets on the\nphotomask.    The  alignment  targets  are  part  of  the\nphotomask  pattern  and  are  located  near  each  corner  of\nthe photomask.   The target in the upper left corner will\nalso  have  a  200  micron  border  around  it  with  a  10\nmicron  space  between  the  target  and  the  border.  When\nappropriate, this additional border will also be used as a\nclosure  test  by  exposing  the  targets  first  and  then  the\nborder at the end of the plate exposure.\n8. 1.1  4 Alignment targets provide op timum alignment\naccuracy.\n8. 1.2   Greater  distance  between  the  t argets  provides\ngreater alignment accuracy.\n8. 1.3   The  target  locations  near  the  e dge  of  the  glass\nprovide the maximum product image area.\n8. 1.4   The  target  pattern  can  be  easily   located  visually\non the photomask.\n8. 1.5  The target can be clear on dark  or dark on clear.\n9  Product Labeling\n9. 1  General   \u2014   Large   Area   Masks    used   in   FPD\nmanufacturing   are   valuable,   fragile   and   prone   to\ncontamination  prior  to  use.  The  content  of  a  LAM  is\ndifficult  to  discern  unless  each  unit  contains  a  unique\nID  that  can  be  read  by  various  tools.  To  simplify\nAMHS  and  process/metrology  tool  operations,  this  ID\nneeds to be consistently readable on the bare mask, with\nand without resist coating; ideally it would be readable\nthrough  the  plastic  container  in  which  the  mask  is\nshipped. See Figures 7\u201310.\n9. 2  Summary \u2014 The labeling spec ified herein consists\nof   a   rectangular   two-dimensional   (2-D),   machine-\nreadable, binary Data Matrix symbology located on the\npattern  surface  of  LAMs,  within  the  edge  region  and\nnear  the  orientation  corner.
