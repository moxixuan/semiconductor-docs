The return path ismade by tying all other traces (except for the targettrace in the same electric potential) together. The targettrace is tied to the return path at the bonding finger (seeFigure 2). Figure 1Internal Inductance Measurement Figure 2Concept of Internal Inductance5.2 four-point probe  The probe consists of fourcoaxial measuring terminals, Hc (current high), Hp(potential high), Lc (current low) and Lp (potential low),to measure impedance. Independent coaxial cables areused between the package being measured and themeasurement instrument to minimize the effect causedby mutual inductance (between terminals) and/orinterferences from the measured signals (see Figures 3and 6). 6 Summary of MethodFabricate the package to be measured. Then measurethe inductance of internal traces using the four terminalprobe method. 7 Interference7.1 It is desirable that an operator who is familiar withthe measuring system, measuring method, and

SEMI G24-89 © SEMI 1984, 19961 SEMI G24-89TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING THE LEAD-TO-LEAD AND LOADINGCAPACITANCE OF PACKAGE LEADS 1 1 This test method applies to measurements in the range of 1 to 100 pico farands. 1 PurposeThis document defines the equipment, materials, andprocedures used to measure the lead-to-lead andloading capacitance of package leads. Semiconductorpackages are shown as examples; however, otherpackaging elements can be measured by this method. 2 Equipment and Materials2.1 Capacitance meter which uses a two probe plusguard method with two coax cables, or a meter whichutilizes a four probe plus guard method. The four probemethod requires four cables to be modified to connectto two probes at the probe end of the cables. Bothmethods require an 18 awg. or larger insulated wire forthe guard connection. Keep cables at minimum length(1 meter) unless specified by individual equipment.Coaxial cables must be used to connect the probes tothe meter. Meter accuracy ± 2%. The probe shieldsmust be connected together. This connection should beshort, approximately one to two inches.2.2 Probe station with two coax pr obes and oneregular probe. Recommendation: Micromanipulator,two (2) each coax probe model 44-FPC-6000 with #5collet, and one each OON-FPC-6000 with #3 collet, orequivalent. 3 Procedure: Lead-to-Lead Capacitance(SeeFigure 1)3.1 Set the instrument to measure at 1 Mhz. If theequipment has a cable length selection switch, adjustthe switch to the appropriate coax cable length. Figure 1Lead-to-Lead Capacitance 3.2 Connect together all the pins in close proximity tothose being measured, for multi-layer ceramic packagepins should be chosen to connect all traces adjacent totraces being measured. Example: Eight surroundingpins are connected for the 68 lead pin grid; twelvesurrounding pins are connected together for the 124 pingrid; eight surrounding pins are connected together forall flat packs (see Figure 1). If there are power planesand/or large power buses in the package, their pins mustbe connected together with the eight or 12 surroundingpins discussed above.3.3 Place the guard probe down on the cavity side ofany one of the eight or 12 leads discussed in Section3.2, to ensure that they will not affect the measurement.3.4 Place one coaxial probe appro ximately 1/8 inchabove the cavity side of one of the leads to bemeasured.3.5 Place the other coaxial probe a pproximately 1/8inch above the cavity side of the other lead to bemeasured.3.6 Nulling Procedure  If using an instrument thatauto-zeros, such as the H.P.4275A, follow theinstrument instructions for capacitance measurement. Ifthis type of instrument is not being used, take thereading on the instrument at this point.

SEMI G25-89 © SEMI 1984, 19891 SEMI G25-89TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING THE RESISTANCE OF PACKAGELEADS 1 PurposeThis document defines the equipment, materials, andprocedure used to measure the resistance of leads inpackaging elements. This document uses a pin grid(cavity down) package as one example of the type ofpackaging element that can be measured with themethod described herein; however, this measurementtechnique can be applied to other geometrics withproper consideration. 2 Equipment and Materials2.1 D.C. Ohmmeter which uses th e four point probe(Kelvin) method with four cables. Minimum accuracyshould be ± 4 mΩ.2.2 Probe station with four probes . Probes should besuch that the taper of the probe and the diameter of itspoint allow two probes to come together within a 5 mil.square without touching each other elsewhere.Recommendation: Micromanipulator, four each, probenumber OON-FPC-6000 with #3 collet or equivalent. 3 Procedure3.1 Place both probes of the low s ide of the meter asclose together as possible on the shoulder or in thecenter of the outside lead (see Figure 1, Point A).3.2 Place both probes of the high s ide of the meterwithin 5 mils of the end of the lead on the cavity side ofthe lead (see Figure 1, Point B).3.3 Set the ohmmeter scale to the lowest settingpossible without putting meter in an over rangemode. Figure 1Resistance Measurement 3.4 Take resistance reading. Overall accuracy with thismethod is ± 20 mΩ. This accuracy estimate includesbasic instrumentation error, probe placementrepeatability, and typical package construction (printedpattern accuracy).= 4 Application NoteReadings below 100 mΩ can be made with acceptablereeatability if considerable care in pleacement is taken.For example, in measuring a conductor made oftungsten 0.010" wide, a 0.010" variation in the distancebetween the two sets of probes will result in a 15 mΩchange in the measured reading. The same variation ina gold conductor would result in a 35 mΩ error. NOTICE: These standards do not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with their use.

A separate specific electrode foreach ion is required and, in some instances, a referenceelectrode may be necessary to complete the test.Individual standards are needed for each ion tested.Methodology recommended by the manufacturer foreach ion specific electrode should be closely followed.Measured concentrations corrected for blank valueshould be compared to the known standards in therange 0.1100 ppm. Chloride and bromide are usuallydetermined, using a solid state single electrode.Determination of sulfate and phosphate ions mayrequire use of additional buffers and a titration.6.4 Determination of Sodium, Potassium, andAntimony Using Atomic Absorption6.4.1 Apparatus  Atomic absorptionspectrophotometer.6.4.2 Standard Solutions6.4.2.1 Sodium standard solutions 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6,0.8, 1.0 ppm.6.4.2.2 Potassium standard solutions 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6,0.8, 1.0 ppm. 6.4.2.3 Antimony standard solution 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6,0.8, 1.0 ppm.6.4.3 Measurement  Set up instrument according tomanufacturers recommendation.

A filtered aliquot of sample isinjected into an Ion chromatograph. The sample ispumped by the eluent stream through two (2) differention exchange columns: a guard column, which serves toprotect the separator column from residual particulatematter and retain certain organics, and the separatorcolumn, the primary function of which is to separateanalyzed ions based on their affinity for the exchangesites of the resin. Both guard column and the separatorcolumn are packed with identical low capacity anionexchanger (anion analysis) or cation exchange (cationanalysis). The separated ionic species then pass to adetector module consisting of a chemical suppressordevice and a conductivity cell. The suppressor device isused to reduce background conductivity of the eluent toa low, or negligible level, and convert analyte anionsinto their acid form or analyte cations into theirhydroxide form. Thus, separated and modified ionicspecies are detected using an electrical conductivitycell. Anions are identified based on their retention timecompared to the known standards. Quantitation isaccomplished by measuring the peak height or area, andcomparing it to a calibration curve generated fromknown standards.NOTE 5: For recommended practice for ion chromatographyanalyses, see instrument manufacturers literature and ASTMD 4327.6.5.2 Interferences6.5.2.1 High levels of organic acids may be present inmolding compound extracts. This may interfere withinorganic anion analysis. Two (2) common species,formate and acetate, elute between fluoride andchloride. This may be minimized by modifyinginstrument set-up.6.5.2.2 Certain amines may interfere with thedetermination of sodium or potassium. This may beminimized by using different instrument set-ups.

The sample extract is aspirated into theplasma by means of a high purity argon carrier gas. Theresulting emissions are directed into the spectrometerand signal strengths are read by photomultiplier tubesplaced at emission points in a focal curve. A computeris used to scan each elemental channel many times asecond, and this output is sent to a printer in numericalform. The cycle or time of analysis is usually aboutseven (7) seconds. With this instrument, very little ofthe extracted sample is consumed.

SEMI G30-88 © SEMI 1986, 19881 SEMI G30-88TEST METHOD FOR JUNCTION-TO-CASE THERMAL RESISTANCEMEASUREMENTS OF CERAMIC PACKAGES 1 PurposeThe purpose of this test is to determine the thermalresistance of ceramic packages using thermal test chips.This test method deals only with junction-to-case ormounting surface measurements of thermal resistanceand limits itself to heat sink and fluid bath testingenvironments. Following the guidelines outlined in thistest method, junction-to-case thermal resistancemeasurements of ceramic packages using the heat sinkand fluid bath methods should give the same resultsonly under certain limited conditions (i.e., underconditions that approximate unidirectional heat flowthrough the chip and substrate to the preferred heatremoval surface). If discrepancies occur, the heat sinkmounting technique shall be considered as the refereetest method. The heat sink mounting method formeasuring junction-to-case thermal resistance will be aconservative measure of the packages ability totransfer heat to the ambient environment because heatsinking is provided only on one side of the package,whereas the fluid bath mounting method has thepotential for equally cooling both sides of the package.1.1 Definitions  The following d efinitions andsymbols shall apply for the purpose of this test:a. case temperature, T C, in degrees Celsius. The casetemperature is the temperature at a specifiedaccessible reference point on the package in whichthe microelectronic chip is mounted.b. mounting surface temperature, T M, in degreesCelsius. The mounting surface temperature is thetemperature of a specified point at the device-heatsink mounting interface (or primary heat removalsurface).c. junction temperature, T J, in degrees Celsius. Theterm is used to denote the temperature of thesemiconductor junction in the microcircuit in whichthe major part of the heat is generated. For purposesof this test, the measured junction temperature isonly indicative of the temperature in the immediatevicinity of the element used to sense thetemperature.d. power dissipation, P H , in watts, is the heating powerapplied to the device causing a junction-to-referencepoint temperature difference. e. thermal resistance, junction-to-specified referencepoint, RJR, in degrees Celsius/watt. The thermalresistance of the microcircuit is the temperaturedifference from the junction to some reference pointon the package divided by the power dissipation P H .f. temperature-sensitive parameter, TSP, is thetemperature-dependent electrical characteristic ofthe junction under test which can be calibrated withrespect to temperature and subsequently used todetect the junction temperature of interest. 2 Apparatus2.1 The apparatus required for the se tests shall includethe following as applicable to the specified testprocedures.a. Thermocouple material shall be copper-constantan(type T) or equivalent, for the temperature range-100 to +300°C. The wire size shall be no largerthan AWG size 30. The junction of thethermocouple shall be welded to form a bead ratherthan soldered or twisted. The accuracy of thethermocouple and associated measuring systemshall be ± 0.5°C.b. Suitable electrical equipment as required to providecontrolled levels of conditioning power and to makethe specified measurements. The instrument used toelectrically measure the temperature-sensitiveparameter shall be capable of resolving a voltagechange of 0.5 mV.c. Controlled temperature chamber, fluid bath, or heatsink capable of maintaining the specified referencepoint temperature to within ± 0.5°C of the preset(measured) value. Typical temperature-controlledheat sink and fluid bath assemblies are presented forillustrative purposes only. 2.2 Heat Sink Assembly  A typic al heat sinkassembly for mounting the microelectronic deviceunder test is shown in Figure 1. The primary heat sinkis water cooled using a temperature-controlled fluidcirculator bath. An adapter socket/heat sink is fastenedto the heat removal surface of the primary heat sink,and has a special geometry to handle specific sizepackages (e.g., flat packs, dual-in-line packages, chipcarriers). This adapter provides a repeatable and

&lt;!-- Page 42 --&gt;

SEMI G30-88 © SEMI 1986, 1988 2 efficient interface between the package and the primaryheat sink. The mounting surface temperature isdetermined with a thermocouple attached from the sideor bottom of the adapter with a thermal conductingadhesive or grease at or near the interface between theadapter and the package. It is at this point that thedevice-under-test temperature is specified andcontrolled. The adapter also contains the socket or otherelectrical interconnection scheme. A thin coating (about25  50 mm thick) of a thermal heat-sinking compound,such as zinc-oxide-loaded silicone thermal grease, isused at the interface to provide a reliable thermalcontact.2.3 Fluid Bath Assembly  A typ ical temperature-controlled fluid bath for thermally characterizing themicroelectronic device under test is shown in Figure 2.In this figure, the package is mounted in a fluid bathseparate from the fluid circulator, although it can beimmersed directly in an integrated fluid circulator/bathunit. The fluid in the bath should be continuouslystirred or agitated to ensure the required temperaturestability. Since this working fluid is being used as aninfinite heat sink, the case-to-fluid (ambient)temperature difference at the case temperature referencepoint of interest should be minimized, i.e., less than orequal to 20°C. For case-to-fluid temperature differencesgreater than 20°C, accuracy and repeatabilitydifficulties may occur due to a large variabletemperature gradient in the fluid film boundary layer atthe package-fluid interface. The case-to-fluidtemperature difference can be minimized by increasingthe fluid velocity and by decreasing the power densityseen by the fluid. The device under test should bemounted such that heat transfer to the fluid is notimpeded. For leaded devices, the leads should beoriented in such a manner so as not to interfere with theheat transfer to the fluid and provide freedom to anythermal currents caused by the power dissipation withinthe package. The case temperature of the device undertest should be measured with a thermocouple that isattached to the package and should not be assumed tobe at the fluid temperature. Care should be taken tominimize exposure of the thermocouple bead to thehigh temperature gradient in the fluid film boundarylayer at the package-fluid interface. The working fluidshould have a thermal conductivity at 25°C of at least0.0006 W/cm°C. Working fluids such as inertfluorocarbon liquids and silicone oils are suitable as acooling media. 3 Procedure3.1 Direct Measurement of Refere nce PointTemperature  T C. For the purpose of measuring amicroelectronic device thermal resistance, the referencepoint temperature shall be measured at the package location of highest temperature which is accessibleoutside the package. This reference point location isdetermined with the device operating in free air andwith no external heat-sinking. In general, this referencepoint is found to be on the outside surface of thepackage substrate directly underneath the chip in themajor path of heat flow from the chip to the heat sink orambient. Examples of the reference point location forboth cavity-up and cavity-down ceramic packages aredepicted in Figure 3. The package surface may bealtered to facilitate this measurement, provided thatsuch alteration does not affect the original heat transferpaths and, hence, the thermal resistance, within thepackage by more than a few percent. For packages withan integral heat dissipater attached to the outsidesurface of the package substrate, the case temperaturereference point shall be on the surface of the heatdissipater at a point opposite the backside of the chip asindicated in Figure 4.3.1.1 Case temperature, T C. The mic roelectronicdevice under test shall be mounted under specifiedconditions so that the case temperature can be held atthe specified value. A thermocouple shall be attachedon the surface of the device package directly under thechip. A conducting epoxy may be used for this purpose.The thermocouple bead should be in direct mechanicalcontact with the case of the microelectronic deviceunder test. For devices which, in their normalapplication, are intimately connected (by pressurecontact, adhesive, soldering, or other means) to anexternal heat sink, the mounting surface temperature, asmeasured directly below the primary heat removalsurface of the case, may be used as the equivalent casetemperature.If it is found that attaching the thermocouple directly tothe case is impractical, an alternate approach utilizing athermocouple welded to one side of a thin metal diskshould be used. This can be accomplished by parallelgap welding the crossed thermocouple wires to one sideof a 0.25 cm (0.094 in) diameter, 0.02 cm (0.008 in)thick beryllium-copper disk and then, with a thin layerof adhesive, bonding the other side of the disk to thecase at the point of interest.3.1.1.1 Mounting surface temperature , T M. Themounting surface temperature is measured directlybelow the primary heat removal surface of the case. It ismeasured with a thermocouple at or near the mountingsurface of the heat sink. A typical mountingarrangement is shown in Figure 5. The surface of thecopper mounting base shall be nickel plated and free ofoxides.The thermocouple hole shall be drilled into themounting base such that the thermocouple lead isdirectly below the area on the case of interest. It is

&lt;!-- Page 43 --&gt;

SEMI G30-88 © SEMI 1986, 19883 recommended that the thermocouple be secured into themounting base with a thermal conducting adhesive (orsolder) and that particular attention be paid tominimizing air voids around the ball or thethermocouple. A thermal conducting compound (oradhesive) should be used at the interfaces of themounting base and the device under test. The mountingsurface technique is application oriented in that it takesinto account the mounting surface interface.3.2 Thermal Resistance, Junction-t o-SpecifiedReference point, RJR3.2.1 General Considerations  Th e thermalresistance of a semiconductor device is a measure of theability of its carrier or package and mounting techniqueto provide for heat removal from the semiconductorjunction. The thermal resistance of a microelectronicdevice can be calculated when the case/mountingsurface temperature and power dissipation in the deviceand a measurement of the junction temperature areknown.When making the indicated measurements, the packageshall be considered to have achieved thermalequilibrium when halving the time between theapplication of power and the taking of the readingcauses no error in the indicated results within therequired accuracy of measurement.3.2.2 Indirect Measurement of Junct ion Temperaturefor the Determination of RJR  The purpose of the testis to measure the thermal resistance of integratedcircuits by using particular semiconductor elements onthe chip to indicate the device junction temperature. Inorder to obtain a realistic estimate of the operatingjunction temperature, the whole chip in the packageshould be powered in order to provide the properinternal temperature distribution. During measurementof the junction temperature the chip heating power(constant voltage source) shall remain constant whilethe junction calibration current remains stable. It isassumed that the calibration current will not be affectedby the circuit operation during the application ofheating power.The temperature-sensitive device parameter is used asan indicator of an average (weighted) junctiontemperature of the semiconductor element forcalculations of thermal resistance. The measuredjunction temperature is indicative of the temperatureonly in the immediate vicinity of the element used tosense the temperature.The temperature-sensitive electrical parametersgenerally used to indirectly measure the junctiontemperature are the forward voltage of diodes and theemitter-base voltage of bipolar transistors. Otherappropriate temperature-sensitive parameters may be used for indirectly measuring junction temperature forfabrication technologies that do not lend themselves tosensing the active junction voltages.3.2.2.1 Steady-state technique for mea suring T J. Thefollowing symbols shall apply for the purpose of thesemeasurements: I M Measuring current in milliamperes.V MH- Value of temperature-sensitive parameter inmillivolts, measured at IM, and corresponding to thetemperature of the junction heated by P H.TMC- Calibration temperature in degrees Celsius,measured at the reference point.V MC- Value of temperature-sensitive parameter inmillivolts, measured at IM, and specific value ofTMC. The measurement of T J using junction forward voltageas the TSP is made in the following manner:Step 1  Measurement of the temperature coefficientof the TSP (calibration).The coefficient of the temperature-sensitive parameteris generated by measuring the TSP as a function of thereference point temperature, for a specified constantmeasuring current, IM, by externally heating the deviceunder test in an oven or in a fluid bath. The reference-point temperature range used during calibration shallencompass the temperature range encountered in thepower application test (see Step 2). The measuringcurrent is generally chosen such that the TSP decreaseslinearly with increasing temperature over the range ofinterest, and that negligible internal heating occurs inthe silicon and metal traces. For determining theoptimum TSP calibration or measuring current, V MC vs.log I M curves for two temperature levels that encompassthe calibration temperature range of interest should beplotted. The optimum measuring current, I M, is thenselected such that it resides on the linear portion of thetwo V MC vs. log I M curves that were generated. Ameasuring current ranging from 0.05 to 5 mA isgenerally used, depending on the specifications andoperating conditions of the device under test, formeasuring the TSP. The value of the TSP temperaturecoefficient, V MC/T MC, for the particular measuringcurrent used in the test, is calculated from thecalibration curve, V MC vs. T MC. At least three pointsshould be used to generate the voltage vs. temperaturecurve for the determination of the TSP temperaturecoefficient.Step 2  Power application test.The power application test is performed in two parts.For both portions of the test, the reference pointtemperature is held constant at a preset value.

The microelectronic deviceunder test shall then be operated with heating power(P H ) applied. The temperature-sensitive parameter,V MH , shall be measured with constant measuringcurrent, I M, that was applied during the calibrationprocedure (See Step 1).The heating power, P H , shall be chosen such that thecalculated junction-to-reference point temperaturedifference as measured at VMH is greater than or equalto 20°C. In accomplishing this, the device under testshould not be operated at such a high heating powerlevel that the on-chip temperature-sensing and heatingcircuitry is no longer electrically isolated. Care shouldalso be taken not to exceed the design ratings of thepackage-interconnect system, as this may lead to anoverestimation of the power being dissipated in theactive area of the chip due to excessive power losses inthe package leads and wire bonds. The values of V MH ,V MC, and P H are recorded during the power applicationtest.The following data shall be recorded for these testconditions:a. Temperature-sensitive electrical parameters (VF,V EB, or other appropriate TSP).b. Junction temperature, T J, is calculated from theequation: TJ = TR + VMH  VMC( ) VMCTMC  1 where TR = TC or TM c. Case or mounting surface temperature, T C or T M.d. Power dissipation, P H .e. Mounting arrangement (including packagemounting force). 3.3 Calculations of R JR3.3.1 Calculations of Package Therm al Resistance The thermal resistance of a microelectronic device canbe calculated when the junction temperature, T J, hasbeen measured in accordance with procedures outlinedin Sections 3.1 and 3.2. With the data recorded from each test, the thermalresistance shall be determined from:R JR = TJ  TRPH(package), junction - to reference point, where RQJR = RQJC or RQJM and TR = TC or TM, respectively. 4 Summary ReportThe following details shall be specified as appropriate:a. Description of package, including thermal test chip,location of case or chip carrier temperaturemeasurement(s), and heat sinking arrangement.b. Test condition(s), as applicable (see Section 3).c.

Mold wear, typically at gates, is a majorreason for mold rework. This test method may be usedby suppliers to evaluate new molding materials orcontrol current materials or by customers to evaluatethe use of new materials. This test method provides acomparison of abrasiveness between materials.2.2 This procedure can be used to determine theabrasive character of a given molding compound.Knowing the conditions of test, the results of the test,and the mold life experience (within ones owncompany) in the field, it is possible to judge if amolding compound is more or less abrasive to currentcompound in use. 3 Referenced Documents3.1 Operational manuals for all eq uipment listedwithin this document.3.2 Mold compound data sheets 4 MethodThis procedure determines the abrasive character of agiven filled molding compound by measuring orificeweight loss as a function of extruded volume. 5 Interferences5.1 Care must be taken to avoid or ifice weight loss bymishandling during placing and removing the orificefrom the mold base.5.2 Before the orifice is re-weighe d after molding,carefully remove all contamination. 6 Equipment6.1 Transfer molding press, 50 ton s clamp minimum6.2 Dielectric preheater 6.3 Orifice insert and mold assemb ly (See Figures 26.)6.4 Mold base with pot diameter 1 .75 to 2.00 inches6.5 Photoelectric safety light scree n6.6 Stop watch6.7 Pyrometer6.8 Force gauge6.9 Asbestos gloves 7 Procedure7.1 Equipment Set-Up  Orifice M old Installation(see Figure 1).7.1.1 Place mold assembly on mold base and alignorifice retainer opening with center of transfer pot.7.1.2 Clamp bottom plate of mold as sembly to bottommold platen.7.1.3 Set press limit switch to ensure clamp slow closeis initiated 1" from completion of mold closing.7.2 Process Parameters7.2.1 Set up the molding parameters according to thematerial data sheet recommendations or expected useconditions, if known.
