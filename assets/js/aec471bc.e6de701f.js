Continuous  handoff  is  the  handoff\noperation  in  which  the  active  equipment  transfers  two  or  more  carriers  sequentially  and  continuously  in  a  carrier\ntransfer  operation.  Some  types  of  AMHS  equipment  are  able  to  handoff  more  than  two  carriers  in  a  transfer\noperation. This capability can be applied to increase the performance of the transfer.\n6. 2.6.2\nWhen  the  passive  equipment  has  a  door  in  front  of  the  load  port,  the  door  on  passive  equipment  must  be\nopened  before  the  carrier  handoff  starts  by  the  active  equipment.  It  is  redundant  to  open  and  close  the  door  for  a\ncarrier handoff when two or more carriers are transferred. Therefore, the door shall be kept open during the carrier\ntransfer operation. Continuous handoff is applied to the transfer operation to avoid redundant operations.\n6. 2.6.3\nContinuous handoff sequence for handoffs at a load port (Unload -> Load): The example time diagram for\ncontinuous  handoff  is  shown  in  Figure  18.  This  example  shows  the  sequence  of  unload  and  load  operations\nperformed continuously at the load port. Each sequence in the continuous handoff is the combination of the single\nhandoff sequence. In addition, the CONT signal is used to indicate a continuous handoff. In the sequence shown in\nFigure  10,  the  carrier  on  the  load  port  is  unloaded  first,  and  a  new  carrier  is  loaded  on  the  load  port.  The  CONT\nsignal  is  turned  ON  at  the  time  of  active  equipment  BUSY  ON  of  the  first  handoff  to  indicate  that  the  handoff  is\ncontinuous. In successive load sequences, the same load port number (CS_0 in this example) is specified to use the\nsame load port. In this example, there are no more carriers that are to be transferred after the second load sequence,\ntherefore  the  active  equipment  turns  the  CONT  signal  OFF  when  the  BUSY  signal  is  turned  ON  in  the  second\nhandoff to indicate the continuous handoff is complete.\n6. 2.6.4\nContinuous  handoff  sequence  for  handoffs  at  different  load  ports  (Load  ->  Load):  The  example  time\ndiagram  for  continuous  handoff  on  the  different  load  ports  is  shown  in  Figure  19.    In  this  example,  the  active\nequipment first transfers a carrier to the load port corresponding to CS_0, then another carrier is transferred to the\nload  port  corresponding  to  CS_1.

The  recommendations  in  this  appendix  are  optional  and  are  not  required  to  conform  to  this  standard.\nDetermination of the suitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user.\nA1-1  General Applications Notes\nA1-1.1  If the connection to the equipment for overhead delivery is made using an electrical connector, Figure A1-1\ndefines a zone on the process or metrology equipment where the plug can be located.  This zone is independent of\nthe exclusion zones for parallel I/O devices defined by SEMI E15.1.  The zones defined in SEMI E15.1 are designed\nto be used primarily for photo-coupled floor based delivery systems such as AGVs or RGVs, while the zone defined\nhere on the top of the passive equipment applies primarily to a plug for overhead communication.  The plug should\nbe on the top or top edge of the equipment as shown and could be on either side of the bay/chase wall, depending on\nthe location of the wall.  In some implementations, the wall may not exist.\nA1-1.2\nDuring the first few sequences of the SEMI E84 protocol before the carrier transfer begins if an error occurs\nthe active vehicle should send an error to the host which leads to an automatic recover without human intervention.\nThe active vehicle, on its own or in response to a host-initiated signal, should automatically recover any SEMI E84\nerror up to the BUSY ON state.\nA1-1.3\nNo  application  of  parallel  I/O  communication  can  provide  perfect  isolation  due  to  Electro-magnetic\nradiation into and between parallel conductors.  Precautions should be taken, by all equipment suppliers, including\nbut not limited to insuring a minimum capacitance of signal lines to reduce susceptibility to noise introduced into the\nequipment.\nA1-1.4\nThere  are  two  types  of  equipment,  internal  buffer  equipment  and  fixed  buffer  equipment.  Internal  buffer\nequipment is equipment that uses locations other than load ports within the equipment to store carriers. Fixed buffer\nequipment is production equipment that has only fixed load ports and no internal buffer for carrier storage. Wafers\nare loaded and unloaded directly from the carrier at the load port for processing.\nA1-1.5\nThis standard specifies two different PI/O configurations, one PI/O per load port and one PI/O per two load\nports (Figure A1-2).  Carrier transfer throughput and efficiency is higher if more than one carrier is transferred at the\nsame time.  Carrier transfer time is also reduced if the intrabay AMHS equipment can deliver two or more carriers at\nthe same time from one parked position.  Typically internal buffer equipment that allows hand-off of two carriers to\ntwo  load  ports  either  simultaneously  or  continuously  can  best  take  advantage  of  these  throughput  improvements.\nThus, internal buffer equipment will require either one PI/O per load port (Figure A1-3, Concept A) or one PI/O per\ntwo  load  ports  (Figure  A1-3,  Concept  B),  depending  on  the  AMHS  delivery  system.    Fixed  buffer  equipment  will\nrequire one PI/O device per load port (Figure A1-4).  Based on their production equipment and AMHS systems, end\nusers will specify the SEMI E84 concept (one PI/O per load port or one PI/O per two load ports) and location that\nwill be required on the manufacturing equipment.\nA1-1.6\nFigure 17 does not define a particular orientation of the PI/O interface sensor unit. Figure A1-5 shows how\nto  orient  the  PI/O  device  for  AGV/RGV  of  the  exclusion  volume  in  the  load  port.

This should signal the\nL_REQ  signal  to  turn  OFF.    The  L_REQ  signal  should  typically  not  turn  OFF  unless\nboth  the  presence  and\nplacement sensors are ON.\n2) When delivering, the Active Equipment should not release the FOUP until L_REQ is OFF.\n3)  During  an  Unload  both  Presence  and  Placement  sensors  are  OFF  once  the  carrier  is  not  detected.    This  should\nsignal the U_REQ signal to turn OFF.  The U_REQ signal should typically not turn OFF unless\nboth the presence\nand placement sensors are OFF.\n4)  The  L_REQ  and  U_REQ  signals  should  turn  off  immediately  after  the  presence  and  placement  sensors  have\nturned  ON  (load)  or  OFF  (unload).    There  should  be  no  delay  timer  between  the  presence  and  placement  sensor\nON/OFF and L_REQ / U_REQ OFF.\n5) During an Unload, once the active vehicle has fully gripped the FOUP, in most cases the vehicle should ignore\nthe response from the U_REQ signal until completion of its move.  For example, the OHT vehicle should not stop\n150 mm \u2013 300 mm above the loadport, check the status of U_REQ and then complete its move.  The OHT should\nfully  complete  its  move,  check  U_REQ  and  finish  the  E84  sequence.    If  the  U_REQ  signal  is  still  high  after  the\ncompletion of its move and the active vehicle can be certain the carrier is safely and securely contained aboard the\nvehicle, in some cases the vehicle should abort the E84 sequence and continue normally to its destination.\nA1-4.7\nError Messages\nA1-4.7.1\nInterlock  timeouts  are  required  to  detect  handoff  sequence  errors  between  the  active  and  passive\nequipment.
