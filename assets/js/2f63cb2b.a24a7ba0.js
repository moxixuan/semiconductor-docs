The  metrics  in\nthe  main  body  of  SEMI  E10  apply  to  non-cluster  or\nsingle-path  cluster  tools  and  individual  modules  in  a\nstraightforward manner.  While these entities are either\nentirely  \xecup\xee  (i.e.,  in  one  of  the  SEMI  E10  uptime\nstates) or entirely \xecdown\xee (i.e., in one of the SEMI E10\ndowntime  states),  multi-path  cluster  tools  may  still  be\ncapable   of   processing   with   some   modules   in   an\nunscheduled downtime state.  Furthermore, the effect of\nmodule  unscheduled  downtime  on  multi-path  cluster\ntool  performance  depends  on  the  specific  multi-path\ncluster   tool   configuration   and   the   combination   of\nmodules  in  an  unscheduled  downtime  state  at  each\npoint in time.\nR1-1.2        Because    module    performance    provides    a\nsufficient  lowest  common  denominator  for  evaluating\nmulti-path  cluster  tool  performance,  all  metrics  in  this\nrelated   information   are   calculated   as   functions   of\nmodule-level   data   only.      Specific   module   tracking\nrequirements are presented.  The metrics, Total Failure\nRate  (TFR)  and  Cluster-Tool  Mean  Time  to  Repair\n(MTTR\nCT\n),  provide  simple  evaluations  of  aggregate\nmodule reliability and maintainability.\nR1-1.3      Other   metrics   are   based   on   the   specific\ncombinations  of  modules  and  process  paths,  defined\nhere as process flows.\nR1-1.3.1  A process  path  is  a  specific  set  of  modules\nfor which each module is unique and has no alternative\nmodules.\nR1-1.3.2  A process  flow  is  a  defined  set  of  modules\nthat is used to achieve a process, where any multi-path\ncluster  tool  may  have  one  or  more  such  process  flows.\nA process flow may include alternative modules at one\nor  more  steps  of  the  process.    A  process  flow  may\ntherefore contain one or many process paths.\nR1-1.4  A method of temporal mapping, defined in this\nrelated  information,  is  used  to  generate  a  history  of\nprocess  flow  and  multi-path  cluster  tool  states  from\nindividual   module   states.      Multi-path   cluster   tool\navailability  is  then  evaluated  as  the  aggregate  process\nflow  availability.    Multi-path  cluster  tool  reliability  is\nevaluated  as  the  expected,  or  mean,  productive  time\nbetween   all   process   flows   being   in   unscheduled\ndowntime.\nR1-2  Module Tracking Requirements\nR1-2.1      Multi-path   cluster   tool   metrics   require   the\ntracking of SEMI E10 state data from all of the modules\nthat  impact  the  RAM  or  productivity  of  a  multi-path\ncluster  tool  or  its  process  flows.

Tracking of these states at the level of\nthe multi-path cluster tool as a whole is insufficient for\naccurate    evaluation    of    performance.        Specific\nrequirements  for  tracking  these  states  at  the  module\nlevel,  as  well  as  requirements  for  handling  the  other\nSEMI E10 states, are presented here.\nR1-2.2.1  Productive  state shall  be  tracked  for  each\nmodule.

For the metrics in this related\ninformation,     cluster-tool     and     process-flow     state\nhistories  are  generated  as  functions  of  module  state\nhistories  on  an  event-by-event  basis  in  temporal,  or\nchronological,   order.      The   metrics   themselves   are\ncalculated  as  functions  of  these  output  state  histories.\nFor   reference,   this   technique   may   be   regarded   as\ngenerating  a  type  of  convolution  of  constituent  state\nmodels.\nR1-4.2    Figure  R1-1  presents  an  example  of  temporal\nmapping.  The constituent input states for two modules,\nM1 and M2, are shown over the observation period t =\n0 to t = 10.  An output state is mapped temporally as a\nfunction of the module states, where if either module is\n\xecdown\xee or both modules are \xecdown,\xee the output state is\n\xecdown.\xee  Note that transition events for the output state\nhistory are the union set of the transition events for the\nconstituent input state histories.\nR1-4.3  In  a  near-real-time  tracking  system,  temporal\nmapping  may  be  performed  as  each  event  is  generated\nand   received   by   the   tracking   system.      Temporal\nmapping  also  may  be  performed  afterwards  as  a  batch\nprocess.  Regardless,  the  logical  process  is  the  same.\nDepending on the mapping to be performed, a different\nlogic  function  is  applied  at  each  input  state  transition\nevent to derive an output state value as a function of the\nconstituent  input  state  values.    Two  specific  temporal\nmapping  functions  are  used  in  metrics  in  this  related\ninformation:\nR1-4.3.1          Process     flow     \xecup/scheduled     downtime/\nunscheduled      downtime\xee      states      from      module\n\xecup/scheduled downtime/unscheduled downtime\xee states\nas  a  function  of  supplier-defined  and/or  user-defined\nprocess flows.\nR1-4.3.2      Multi-path   cluster   tool   \xecproductive/neutral/\nunscheduled    downtime\xee    as    a    standard    function,\npresented     herein,     of     module     \xecproductive/not-\nproductive\xee   states   and   process-flow   \xecup/scheduled\ndowntime/unscheduled downtime\xee states.\nNOTE 5:  While it may be theoretically possible to model the\ndesired   output   states   using   Harel   notation   and   modeling\nconcepts,  output  state  complexity  may  be  confounded  by  the\ncombinatorial  nature  of  multi-path  cluster  tools  and  their\nprocess  flows.

It   is\nimportant to differentiate between all the process flows\nthat  are  theoretically  possible  on  a  given  multi-path\ncluster  tool  configuration  and  those  intended  process\nflows  (IPF)  that  are  actually  intended  for  operational\nuse   (i.e.,   performing   its   intended   function).      For\nmeaningful  agreement  between  any  two  parties  on  the\nmetrics presented in this related information, first there\nshall be documented agreement on the set of IPFs used\nfor evaluation, so that any analyst with the module state\nhistories  can  calculate  the  same  values  for  the  metrics.\nFirst, the general case of \xecup/down\xee states for an IPF is\npresented,   and   then   later   the   distinction   between\nunscheduled  downtime  and  total  (i.e.,  scheduled  and\nunscheduled) downtime for an IPF is presented.\nR1-5.2      An   IPF   \xecup/down\xee   state   is   modeled   as   a\nnetwork  flow  through  the  modules  that  make  up  that\nIPF.  If there is \xecconnectivity\xee through the IPF network,\nthen  the  IPF  is  \xecup;\xee  otherwise  it  is  \xecdown.\xee    The\nmodules  in  an  IPF  network  have  series  and  parallel\nrelationships  that  determine  the  connectivity  through\nthe  network.    Mathematically,  each  module  and  each\nIPF  has  a  state  value  equal  to  1  when  the  state  is  \xecup\xee\nand 0 when the state is \xecdown.\xee For example,"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"M\ni"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"=\n1, if module i is up\n0, if module i is down"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"R1-5.3  The general process steps within an IPF have a\nmutually  serial  relationship  (i.e.,  if  connectivity  is  not\npossible  through  any  single  step,  then  connectivity  is\nnot possible through the network).

Standard pressure has\nalmost  universally  been  accepted  as  one  atmosphere,\nexcept for rounding errors in different units.\n10. 2    Further  confusion  has  existed  in  the  definition  of\nstandard  density  when  extended  to  vapors.  For  perfect\ngases (most light gases are nearly perfect), the standard\ndensity  can  be  defined  as  the  density  of  the  gas  at\nstandard  temperature  and  pressure.  Since  one  gram\nmole of a perfect gas occupies 22,414 cubic centimeters\nat   standard   pressure   and   standard   temperature,   it\nfollows  that  a  flow  rate  of  22,414  sccm  of  any  perfect\ngas is one mole per minute.\n10. 3  By defining standard density as in Section 7.1, the\ncorrelation between sccm and moles/minute is retained,\neven for vapors. If standard density were defined as the\nactual density of the vapor at standard temperature and\npressure,  then  the  correlation  with  moles  per  minute\nwould  differ  by  the  vapor's  compressibility  factor  (Z).\nThis   is   not   an   acceptable   alternative   because   the\ncompressibility   of   many   vapors   is   not   accurately\nknown,  and,  in  fact,  does  not  exist  for  those  materials\nthat are liquid at standard temperature and pressure.\n11  Implications for Calibration\n11. 1    Since  the  standard  flow  units  are  defined  at  a\nstandard  density,  they  represent  units  of  mass  flow\nrather than volumetric flow.\n11. 2      Gravimetric   calibration   readings   in   grams   per\nminute  (g/min)  can  be  converted  to  standard  cubic\ncentimeters   per   minute   (sccm)   by   dividing   by   the\nstandard density (g/scc) as defined in Section 7.1.\n11. 3      Rate-of-rise   (ROR)   data   will   generally   have\nnegligible  compressibility  error  when  operated  over  a\nlow  absolute  pressure  range.  If  compressibility  errors\nare  significant,  they  will  cause  the  rate  of  pressure  rise\nto  be  reduced  and  become  pressure-dependent  as  the\npressure increases. In this case, the pressure range must\nbe reduced, or correction made, for compressibility.\n11. 4    Volumetric  flow  data  must  be  corrected  from\nactual density of the real gas at the test conditions to the\nstandard     density.     The     actual     density     can     be\napproximated   for   near-perfect   gases   by   ratios   of\nabsolute   pressure   and   temperature   to   the   standard\ndensity.   For   vapors,   the   actual   density   at   the   test\nconditions must be known from other data.\nNOTICE:      SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or\nrepresentations  as  to  the  suitability  of  the  standards  set\nforth    herein    for    any    particular    application.

In  fact,  compatibility  of  automation  and  human  ergonomics  has  been  considered  of  primary\nimportance in the rewrite of this standard.\nA1-2  The  increased  value  for  C1,  of  75  mm,  over  the  previous  value  in  this  standard  is  determined  by  the\nergonomic  requirement  to  accommodate  a  95th  percentile  human  male  hand  carrying  a  pod  by  its  handles.\nLimitation  of  the  load  port  height  to  900  mm  was,  again,  driven  by  ergonomic  considerations,  as  the  previously\nallowed value of up to 1300 mm was clearly \u201cuser unfriendly.\u201d\nA1-3  Equipment  suppliers  must  consider  the  dimension,  S,  in  order  to  ensure  that  their  tool  will  be  compatible\nwith  automation  systems  and  pods.  This  fact  applies  to  tools  with  more  than  one  load  port  per  tool.  In  order  to\nenable space for two pods on side-by-side load ports, the dimension, S, must be greater than or equal to 350 mm for\ntools processing 150 mm or smaller wafers, and 400 mm for 200 mm wafer tools. The dimension, S, is defined as\nthe distance between wafer carrier centroids. Driving factors for S are that the size of a pod is larger than a cassette\nand that ergonomic guidelines suggest a clearance of at least 75 mm between the box and an adjacent object in order\nto provide space for the human hands to grasp and pick up the box by its handles.\nA1-4  A  global  horizontal  placement  tolerance  of  15  mm  of  the  carrier  centroid  should  be  allowed  by  the\nalignment means of the load port. (That is, a misalignment by up to \xb1 7.5 mm in both the x and y directions of the\ncarrier centroid will still allow the alignment means to guide the carrier to its correct final location on the load port).\nThe  misplacement  dimension  is  made  large  to  be  consistent  with  the  tactile/visual  capabilities  of  humans  and  the\nplacement  accuracy  of  AGV\u2019s.  This  requires  that  the  load  port  provide  some  alignment  aid  to  bring  the  carrier\ncentroid  to  within  the  final  registration  tolerance  (generally  0.5  mm)  required  by  the  automated  wafer  handling  of\nthe tool. Standards for this registration tolerance will generally be found in the SMIF documents.\nA1-5  The  standard  purposely  does  not  address  vacuum  load  locks.  Since  minimization  of  volume  is  usually  a\ndesign requirement for a vacuum load lock, the minimum clearances (C1 \u2013 C3) of this standard are not compatible\nwith optimum load lock design. It is not intended that vacuum load locks would be the load port of a tool in which\nvacuum  processing  is  performed.  Simple  solutions  exist  today  for  transportation  of  a  cassette,  or  of  individual\nwafers, from a SEMI E15-compatible load port to a vacuum load lock. Open load ports are intended to be specified\nfor use with overhead transport systems for automation.\nA1-6 It is not easy to formulate a standard which allows compatibility with such a wide range of requirements.\nNor  is  it  easy  to  design  equipment  compatible  with  a  number  of  different  standards  affecting  the  same  hardware.\nSEMI E15 covers a wide range of applications without causing undue compromise in any particular implementation,\nwhile remembering that most of our fabs will continue to use human transport in the immediate future. We hope this\nshort discussion of key issues aids in your understanding of the intent and details of the standard.\nNOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for any\nparticular  application.

The tolerances shall be chosen so\nthat the pod door does not extend over the port door in\nany  instance,  even  when  the  port  door  is  built  to  its\nminimal  acceptable  dimensions  and  potential  variance\nbetween  registration  pins  and  holes  is  considered.  This\nis to ensure an interference-free passage of the pod door\nthrough the port opening.\n6. 2.5.2    The  base  of  the  pod  body  shall  fit  freely  but\nwith  close  tolerance  between  the  guide  rails  (B1,  B2,\nand B9), which not only hold the pod in place while the\nport  is  open,  but  also  provide  proper  alignment  for\nclosure of the pod at the end of the open/shut cycle.\n6. 2.5.3    The  bottom  surface  of  the  pod  requires  three\nregistration holes to engage with the registration pins on\nthe port. The registration pins shall be positioned in the\ndoor bottom so that the registration pins prevent seating\nof  the  pod  with  the  port  in  the  event  that  the  pod  is\nimproperly  rotated  by  180  degrees  from  the  correct\norientation.   The   correct   orientation   is   illustrated   in\nFigure 2.\n6. 2.5.4  The perimeter of the bottom surface of the pod\nbody shall be continuous and shall be positioned against\nthe port surface. This positioning assures the activation\nof  an  optional  limit  switch,  placed  in  an  unspecified\nlocation  along  the  port  perimeter,  for  the  sensing  of\nproper pod placement.\n6. 2.5.5      The   center   of   the   cassette   crossbar   shall\ncoincide  with  the  center  of  the  pod  door,  with  the\ncassette oriented as shown in Figure 2.
