SEMI E136-1104 © SEMI 20041 SEMI E136-1104TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE OUTPUT POWER OF RFGENERATORS USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSINGEQUIPMENT RF POWER DELIVERY SYSTEMS This test method was technically approved by the Global Metrics Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Metrics Committee. Current edition approved by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on July 11, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to be publishedNovember 2004. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this test method is to provide anaccurate method for measuring the output power of RFgenerators used in RF power delivery systems forsemiconductor processing equipment to support SEMIE113. 2 Scope2.1 This test method specifies the testing proceduresand test equipment required for determining the trueoutput power (i.e., heating power) output of RFgenerators. This test method uses a calorimetric powermeter, which was calibrated previously using preciseDC substitution techniques as a reference standard.2.2 The primary focus for this test method issemiconductor processing equipment including, but notlimited to, the following equipment types: Dry etch equipment, and Film deposition equipment (CVD and PVD).NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This test method is meant to provide a generalmeans of measuring the true output power of RFgenerators operating over a wide range of frequencyand power. Limitations in the frequency and powercoverage of this method are determined by theindividual system components chosen.3.2 This test method assumes that the transmissionsystem characteristic impedance is 50 Ω.3.3 International, national, and local codes, regulationsand laws should be consulted to ensure that theequipment and procedures meet regulatoryrequirements in each location. 3.4 Certain safety issues associated with the testprocedures themselves are mentioned as a reminder thatsafety procedures are necessary for safe conduct of thetest.3.5 This standard does not address any safety orperformance issues related to RF emissions or electricalcodes (e.g., Underwriters Laboratory, Inc. (UL), theNational Electrical Code (NEC®), FederalCommunications Commission (FCC)). It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to conform tothe appropriate local codes and regulations as applied tothis type of equipment, some of which are covered byreferenced documents. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E113  Specification for SemiconductorProcessing Equipment RF Power Delivery SystemsSEMI E114  Test Method for RF Cable AssembliesUsed in Semiconductor Processing Equipment RFPower Delivery SystemsNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms5.1.1 AC  Alternating Current5.1.2 CVD  Chemical Vapor Deposition5.1.3 DC  Direct Current5.1.4 NIST  National Institute for Standards andTechnology5.1.5 PVD  Physical Vapor Deposition5.1.6 RF  Radio Frequency5.1.7 VSWR  Voltage Standing Wave Ratio5.2 Definitions5.2.1 cable assembly  the section of cable(transmission line), including the connectors, used to

For example, the second harmonic of 13.56MHz is 27.12 MHz.5.2.4 RF generator  a component in the RF powerdelivery system used to develop RF energy.5.2.5 RF termination  a device for terminating RFtransmission systems, and converting RF electricalenergy into heat. RF terminations normally have valuesthat are the same as the characteristic impedance of thetransmission system.5.2.6 RF load  another term used to describe an RFtermination. 6 Test Apparatus6.1 Calorimetric Power Meter  This instrument isdesigned to be used in conjunction with a highefficiency water-cooled RF termination, rated for themaximum power output of the RF generator. Typicalcalorimetric power meters use internal thermocouple-or thermistor-type temperature sensors, a precisioncoolant flow meter, and processing circuits for storageof calibration constants and coolant physicalcharacteristics. Choose instruments capable ofproviding a power measurement accuracy of ± 1% aftercalibration at a specific power level.6.2 Water-Cooled RF Termination  This deviceprovides a low VSWR (i.e., high return loss)termination for the testing of the RF generator. Use anRF termination sized appropriately for the RF generatorunder test. Finally, use an RF termination capable ofdissipating DC energy, without damage due to theeffects of electrolysis. The return loss of the RFtermination, including the interconnecting cablebetween the RF generator and the termination shall beno less than 30 dB. This return loss ensures maximumpower transfer between the RF generator and thecalorimeter.NOTE 1: See Section 7 for safety-related recommendationsrelated to RF terminations. 6.3 Voltage and Current Meters  These meters areused to measure the voltage and current presented to thecalorimeter load during the DC calibration of thecalorimeter. These instruments shall have a certificateindicating NIST traceability. Choose meters capable ofvoltage and current measurement accuracy of less than0.2%.6.4 Calibration Power Supply  This power supply isused as a source of clean DC energy for the purposes ofcalibrating the calorimetric power meter. Use a powersupply sized for the calibration to be performed and thatprovides a very stable output at all levels.6.5 Cables and Connectors  Various interconnectingcables are required to perform the tests outlined in thistest method. These include low-loss cables to connectthe DC power source to the measuring instrument andto the RF load, in addition to low-loss RF cables andconnectors to connect the RF generator output to theload.6.5.1 In order to keep cable losses to a minimum,minimize the lengths of interconnecting cables.6.5.2 In addition, compensate for the losses associatedwith interconnecting cables used.NOTE 2: For example, if 6 m (20 feet) of #10 AWG copperwire is used to connect the DC supply to the calorimeter, thiswire will add approximately 0.04 Ω of resistance between theDC source and the 50 Ω termination. Using a DC supplyvoltage of 500 V terminated by 50 Ω (i.e., 5 kW), this willresult in a loss of about 4 W in the copper wire.6.5.3 Adjust the reading obtained by the calorimeteraccording to the cable loss value.NOTE 3: For example, suppose that an RF generator,operating at 13.56 MHz and developing 3 kW is connected tothe calorimeter through a 6 m (20-foot) length of RG-217/Ucoaxial cable. RG-217/U coaxial cable has a lossspecification of 0.41 dB per 30 m (100 feet) of cable at 13.56MHz. Therefore, for 6 m (20 feet) of cable, the loss would beapproximately 0.41/5, or 0.082 dB. If the RF generator isdeveloping 3 kW, this means that approximately 2.944 kWwould appear at the calorimeter due to the cable loss. 7 Safety PrecautionsNOTE 4: The tests described in this test method involveusing low-output power test instrumentation (typically lessthan 10 mW).7.1 Work should be conducted in accordance withlocal safety requirements and test devicemanufacturers recommended safety procedures.7.2 The area immediately surrounding the test setupshould be kept free and clear of unnecessary equipmentand materials.7.3 Testing personnel should ensure they have

&lt;!-- Page 5 --&gt;

SEMI E136-1104 © SEMI 20043 adequate lifting devices for large weights such as longRF cables and generators themselves.7.4 Persons performing tests should determine whichmethod of water cooling of the resistor in the RFtermination is utilized by the test device manufacturerand should take steps to ensure safe use of the device.7.4.1 Cooling-water flow rates should be appropriate tothe test device manufacturers recommendations forcooling of the power load level being tested. Consultthe RF generator operating manual load specificationsfor this information.7.4.2 An RF termination using internal resistor coolingonly is highly recommended because such resistors (ofthe tubular ceramic, thin film type) are usually cooledby routing the coolant to the inside of the ceramic tubeand away from the resistive film, thereby eliminatingthe possibility of electrolysis affecting the resistivefilm.7.4.3 In an alternative method, the coolant is routed onboth the inside and the outside of the resistor. Whilethis method provides for more efficient cooling, theproximity of the coolant to the resistive film canpotentially result in damage to the resistive film causedby electrolysis generated by the DC energy passingthrough the fluid in the termination.7.4.3.1 For this reason, if an RF termination using bothinternal and external cooling is used, it is important toperiodically check the resistor for damage due toelectrolysis. This can be done easily by measuring theresistance of the load resistor using a simple digitalmultimeter.7.4.3.2 With the RF termination disconnected from theRF cable, place one probe on the center conductor ofthe termination, and the other probe on theterminations outer conductor.7.4.3.3 Measure the DC resistance of this path. If theDC resistance is more than 53 Ω, replace the resistor inthe termination.7.5 In order to prevent the possibility of ground loopsbetween the RF generator and the calorimeter system,be sure to operate the calorimeter and the RF generatoron the same AC supply. 8 Test Setup for RF Generator Power OutputTest8.1 The test setup for the RF generator output powertest consists of the RF generator connected to thecalorimeter power meter through a length of coaxialcable. 8.2 Prior to making any measurements, calibrate thecalorimeter power meter using a source of stable DCenergy. 9 Test Procedure for Determining RFGenerator Output Power9.1 Calorimetric power meters provide excellentreference standards for the measurement of RF energyin that they are capable of measuring the true heatingpower of a waveform, including any harmonic- ornonharmonic-related frequency components. Thetechnique employed for this test is to first calibrate thecalorimetric power meter with DC energy, which canbe very precisely determined. Then, use two digitalmultimeters (e.g., Fluke™ 87 or equivalent) todetermine the actual DC power applied to thecalorimeter. Finally, once the DC calibration has beenperformed at a particular power level, connect theoutput of the RF generator under test to the calorimeterand measure the output power of the RF generator. Thebasic steps involved in the use of this system areoutlined below.9.2 Calibrate the Calorimeter  Calibrate thecalorimeter with the stable DC power supply, using thetwo digital multimeters to read the voltage and currentapplied to the calorimeters RF load.9.3 Connections  Connect the DC power supply, thedigital multimeters, and the RF load according toFigures 1 and 2. Make the connections between themultimeters, the DC power supply, and the RF loadusing high-quality low-loss cable and high-qualitycorrosion-free cable terminations. Figure 1Calorimeter Calibration Configuration

SEMI E136-1104 © SEMI 2004 4 Figure 2Calorimeter Calibration Connection Diagram 9.3.1 Use a calorimeter equipped with a coolantsystem.NOTE 5: Most calorimeter systems use either a tap-watercoolant system or a recirculating system of some type. Bestresults may be obtained through the use of a self-containedheat exchanger and coolant recirculating system.9.3.2 Make all of the electrical and coolant connectionsto the calorimeter.9.3.3 Apply main power to the calorimeter system andallow one hour for stabilization.9.3.4 Load Differential Temperature  Mostcalorimeter systems will yield optimum performancewhen certain operating parameters relating to thedifferential temperature across the RF load and the flowrate are maintained. In most cases, a differentialtemperature of 2°C represents a good beginning point.The coolant flow rate may then be set to provide forthis differential temperature.9.3.4.1 The following formula may be used to arrive atthe correct coolant flow rate.Power = 69.32 T  Flow Rate (1)where:Power is in W,T is in °C, andFlow Rate is in L/min. 9.3.4.2 Solving for flow rate yields:Flow Rate = (Power / 69.32) /T (2)9.3.5 Coolant Types  In most cases, the coolant usedin calorimetric power measurement systems is puredistilled water. In this case, most modern calorimeterswill automatically correct for changes to the coolantphysical characteristics (e.g., specific heat, specificgravity) as the coolant temperature changes.9.3.5.1 If coolant other than pure water is used and thecalorimeter chosen will not automatically compensatefor changes to the coolant, adjust the power readings obtained for the effects of the coolant changes. Consultthe calorimeter operating manual for specific details.9.3.6 Calorimeter Calibration  Following thecalorimeter warm-up, the device is ready forcalibration.9.3.6.1 With the calorimeter operating at theappropriate flow rate, apply DC power to the RF load,according to the voltage and current readings obtainedwith the two digital multimeters.9.3.6.2 Multiply the voltage reading by the currentreading to obtain the power applied to the load.9.3.6.3 Allow 15 minutes for the calorimeter reading tostabilize.9.3.6.4 Using the procedure in the calorimeteroperating manual, set the calorimeter such that thecalorimeter reading is exactly the same as that obtainedusing the voltage and current meters.9.3.6.5 At this point, add any offsets that are associatedwith interconnecting cable losses, as outlined inSections 6.5.2 and 6.5.3.9.3.6.6 The calorimeter is now calibrated at thisspecific power level.NOTE 6: If a new power level is selected, repeat this processin order to compensate for instrumentation linearity effects ofthe calorimeter.9.3.7 RF Generator Testing  With the calorimetercalibrated at a particular power level, it is now possibleto test the RF generator power output at this level.9.3.8 Connections  Connect the RF generator outputto the RF load according to Figure 3. Use cables andconnectors between the RF generator output and the RFload of a high-quality, low-loss type. As outlinedabove, some power will be lost in the cables betweenthe generator and the load. Add these losses as offsetsto the calorimeter reading, in order to obtain the totalpower output of the generator. Base the losses uponcable length, cable type, and operating frequency. SeeSEMI E114 test method for details on cable losscompensation. Figure 3RF Generator Output Power Test

SEMI E136-1104 © SEMI 20045 9.3.9 Testing  With the connections made accordingto Figure 2, apply main power to the RF generator andallow 15 minutes for stabilization. The power readingobtained on the calorimeter will represent the totalpower output of the RF generator, including harmonics.9.3.9.1 Begin RF generator testing at a power level thatrepresents 10% of the maximum output power of theRF generator.9.3.9.2 Repeat the test at RF generator power levels of40% of maximum, 70% of maximum, and maximumpower.9.3.9.3 Also, conduct tests corresponding to each rangeon the RF generator power output meter.NOTE 7: Calibrate the calorimeter power meter to the DCstandard at each power level used.

SEMI E140-0305 © SEMI 20051 SEMI E140-0305GUIDE TO CALCULATE COST OF OWNERSHIP (COO) METRICS FORGAS DELIVERY SYSTEMS This guide was technically approved by the Global Metrics Committee and is the direct responsibility of theNorth American Metrics Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on December 10, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org February 2005; to be publishedMarch 2005. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this guide is to provide standard cost of ownership (COO) metrics for evaluating unit productioncost effectiveness of gas delivery systems in the semiconductor industry.1.2 This guide also illustrates how to apply the COO metrics to gas delivery systems. Users should be able tocalculate the COO for any piece of gas delivery equipment using this guide.NOTE 1: A spreadsheet (Microsoft® Excel) has been provided as an illustrative example.1.3 The guide establishes a well-defined procedure to facilitate an understanding of equipment-related costs byproviding definitions, classifications, algorithms, methods, and default values necessary to build a full or constrainedCOO calculator. 2 Scope2.1 This guide defines a COO metric that can be applied to any gas delivery system. Some terms are specialized tointegrated circuit wafer and device production, but may be adapted for other applications.NOTICE: This guide does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this guideline to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Effective building of a COO model requires identification of constraints and data values. Example data isprovided in this document and may be updated periodically. Where possible, use direct values for inputs rather thanderiving them from secondary models or using example values.3.2 Certain factors are more difficult than others to accurately determine. Figure 1 depicts the relationship of someof the COO factors to ability to collect and validate information. The accuracy of a COO calculation may be proneto a variety of errors or omissions.

&lt;!-- Page 17 --&gt;

SEMI E140-0305 © SEMI 20053 5.2.7 cost of yield loss (CYL)  a unit lost at the end of a given step represents the loss of the cost of the startingunit and the manufacturing to that point. In addition, units leaving a step may be lost at some later step. CalculatingCYL therefore requires knowing the accumulated cost of manufacturing before the unit is lost. Therefore, CYLshould be tracked as a separate cost for factory optimization.5.2.8 default or default value  a value to be used if actual data are not available. Also called example value.Where possible, actual data should be used in COO calculations.5.2.9 defect limited yield (DLY)  the fraction of units that are not lost from defects added by the equipment. Forwafer processing, defect yield is usually derived from a model.5.2.10 easement space  the floor space that must remain clear to the rear and sides of the piece of equipment (butnot in front of the load face plane). This includes safety aisles, ergonomic maintenance access space, componentremoval space, and room for doors to swing out.5.2.11 equipment required (ER)  the integer number of pieces of equipment required to obtain the productionthroughput required for the step.5.2.12 equipment throughput  see throughput.5.2.13 equipment yield (EY)  the percentage of units received by the piece of equipment that can be passed to thenext step based on any criteria such as damaged units, or units determined to be defective by inspection or test.Inclusion of equipment yield results in a decreasing population of units flowing through the factory. At later steps,equipment will process fewer units than the full factory unit starts. For test equipment, validly rejected units arescrap, but not a component of equipment yield.5.2.14 fixed costs  costs incurred once and usually associated with the acquisition and incorporation of a piece ofequipment into the factory.5.2.15 lifetime  the time over which the fixed and recurring costs are spread on an annualized basis.5.2.15.1 production lifetime  the number of years a piece of equipment is used for manufacturing.5.2.15.2 tax lifetime  the number of years as defined in compliance with local tax or accounting depreciationpractices.5.2.16 material  bulk gas, specialty gas, or general or specialty chemical used in the process. Includes monitorunits consumed in the support of the piece of equipment.5.2.17 monitor unit  test or filler unit (e.g., wafer or device) consumed in the support of the piece of equipment.Also called test unit.5.2.18 operational uptime (OU) the percentage of time the piece of equipment is in a condition to perform itsintended function during the period of operations time. This calculation is intended to reflect overall operationalperformance for a piece of equipment (SEMI E10).5.2.18.1 Discussion  As defined, OU has components attributable to both the unit manufacturer and to theequipment supplier.5.2.19 parametric limited yield (PLY)  the fraction of units that are not lost from device parameters being outsidethe required range.5.2.20 product yield (PRY)  the fraction of units that pass through the factory and result in good product.

SEMI E140-0305 © SEMI 20055 RELATED INFORMATION 1COST OF OWNERSHIPNOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E140 and was derived from North AmericanMetrics Committee. This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot on December 10,2004. R1-1 Sample Input to ModelR1-1.1 To effectively illustrate use of the COO model, it was run with a hypothetical set of input data. This inputdata is listed in Table 1. When studying this example, the user should remember that parameter values are for thegas delivery system only, not the entire process piece of equipment. R1-2 Sample Model OutputR1-2.1 The model calculates each term in the numerator of Equation 2 and then sums these results and divides bythe denominator to get COO. To enhance the users understanding of the components of COO, Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5and the spreadsheet show interim results. For the set of inputs listed in Table 1, F$ are shown in Table 2, R$ areshown in Table 3, and Y$ are shown in Table 4. Each of these terms is calculated from the cost factors listed inSEMI E35. The italicized rows in Tables 2, 3, and 4 correspond to these cost factors and show the subtotal for thatcost factor. The breakdown for each cost factor is shown in the rows below it.R1-2.2 Tables 2, 3, and 4 show costs for years 1 through 7. The last year is based on user input. It is the longest ofuseful life or depreciable life. In the example shown, depreciable life was set to 7 years and useful life was set to 5years. The depreciable life was deliberately made longer than the useful life to illustrate the feature of thespreadsheet that allows these two parameter values to differ. This often occurs in practice since a piece ofequipment is sometimes obsoleted before it is fully depreciated. The user can enter any value up to 10 for thesetwo parameters.R1-2.3 Table 5 shows the COO results.Table 1 Input Data for COO Model Row #1 Parameter Units Example ValueTA8 This Section Contains Equipment Procurement Cost DataTA10 Equipment Cost DataTA11 For Straight Line Depreciation, input SLN.

SEMI E141-0705 © SEMI 20051 SEMI E141-0705GUIDE FOR SPECIFICATION OF ELLIPSOMETER EQUIPMENT FORUSE IN INTEGRATED METROLOGY This standard was technically approved by the global Metrics Committee. This edition was approved forpublication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on May 20, 2005. It was available atwww.semi.org in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005. 1 Purpose1.1 The application of integrated metrology is anticipated to become a key factor for advanced process control infuture integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing. Important parameters, which are typically measured for thecharacterization and qualification of device manufacturing steps, are the thickness and the optical properties offabricated layers and the critical dimensions (CD) of submicron structures. For the measurement principle ofellipsometry, which is commonly applied in both applications, different equipment and, hence, procedures andnotations for data acquisition and modeling exist. If, therefore, ellipsometry is to be applied for integrated metrologyequipment, the physical and the software integration into the equipment should be standardized to avoid efforts forspecific installations depending on the equipment and fabrication environment.1.2 The description of the mechanical integration of an ellipsometer into an equipment module (e.g. a front endmodule or an equipment chamber) comprises the specification of the ellipsometer equipment and the spatial arrangement of the ellipsometer modules andcomponents, specification of the relative position of the ellipsometer equipment to the equipment module, and specification of the mechanical interfaces to the equipment module.1.3 A prerequisite for a standardized software integration of an ellipsometer is the standardized notation of the layercounting method, the measurement parameters, the measurement data, and the measurement results. This documentdescribes the position of the metrology equipment with respect to the sample. The position of the measurementposition (i.e. the position of the measurement spot) refers to the description of the wafer surface coordinate systemas described in SEMI M20.1.4 The purpose of this standard is to provide a guide for a unique specification of the most commonly appliedellipsometer equipment, the comprised modules and components, and their spatial arrangement. In this standard, thenotation for parameters required in data acquisition and modeling is specified, and a unique notation for remoteaccess on measurement parameters, data, and results is provided. Derived from these definitions, the requiredparameters to identify the calibration status of an ellipsometer are specified. Additionally, recommendations forpreferred physical units are given.1.5 The standard is intended for use in integrated metrology, but may also be applicable for stand-alone metrology. 2 Scope2.1 This standard covers reflection ellipsometric measurements in integrated metrology.2.2 The standard covers the typical applications of ellipsometry, which are the determination of layer thickness andoptical properties.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 The standard is limited to the measurement technique of ellipsometry although definitions may be applicable tothe measurement technique of polarimetry.

SEMI E141-0705 © SEMI 2005 2 3.2 The standard is limited to the measurement of isotropic samples. It is limited to the application of Stokesvectors, Jones-, or Muller - matrix formalisms for the mathematical treatment of the sequence of optical components(see 7.6).3.3 The ellipsometer equipment differs in the capability to measure all elements of the Stokes vector.3.4 The ellipsometer equipment differs in the capability to measure the number of unknown optical properties of asample and in their capability to measure critical dimension parameters.3.5 This standard does not address the calibration procedures of ellipsometer equipment. 4 Referenced Standards and Documents4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E30.5  Specification for Metrology Specific Equipment Model (MSEM)SEMI E89  Guide for Measurement System Analysis (MSA)SEMI E127  Specification for Integrated Measurement Module Communications: Concepts, Behavior, andServices (IMMC)SEMI M20  Practice for Establishing a Wafer Coordinate SystemSEMI MF576  Test Method for Measurement of Insulator Thickness and Refractive Index on Silicon Substratesby EllipsometryNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 calibration  set of operations that establish, under specified conditions, the relationship between values ofquantities indicated by a measuring instrument or measuring system, or values represented by a material measure ora reference material, and the corresponding values realized by standards1.5.1.2 ellipsometry  a measurement method based on the principle of measuring the change of the polarizationstate of light after reflection from the sample surface. Ellipsometry is commonly applied for the measurement oflayer thickness, refractive index and extinction coefficient, or critical dimensions.5.1.3 in situ measurement  a measurement performed inside the processing chamber of an equipment. If a waferis used for this measurement, the wafer typically can be fed back into the process flow.

The change in both the amplitude and phase of the oscillating parallel andperpendicular vector components of the electric field associated with the beam are measured after reflection fromthe surface as the complex amplitude reflectance ratio (i.e. a change in the polarization of the light beam occurs).There are several possible configurations for ellipsometer equipment, which can be described by the arrangement ofmodules that comprise the optical components required to perform the ellipsometric measurement. In addition, theoptical components also induce changes in the polarization of the light beam.6.1.2 For specification of the ellipsometer equipment, it is necessary to describe all modules and opticalcomponents included both in the measuring and in the reflection process from the sample system and their positionwithin a coordinate system defined by the sample and the light beam. Additionally, information on the number ofwavelengths used for measurement and the method of data acquisition must be provided. The following definitionsare provided for ellipsometer equipment specification.6.2 Ellipsometer module definition (see Figure 1)6.2.1 ellipsometer modules  An ellipsometer consists of two modules, the polarizer module and the analyzermodule.

The photoelastic modulator (PEM) is a component of this type.NOTE 1: A PEM is an electro-optical modulator made of a suitable birefringent material.

SEMI E141-0705 © SEMI 2005 6 7 Definitions for Modeling the Reflection from a Sample Surface7.1 Analysis of Ellipsometric Measurements7.1.1 For the analysis of ellipsometric measurements an optical model describing the optical parameters and layerthickness values of the sample must be provided. The optical model is regarded as part of the necessary substratedata set4. The objective of the ellipsometric measurement is to determine the value of at least one parameter withinthe optical model such that the measurand calculated from the optical model is in optimum consistency with themeasurand (raw data value1) determined in the measurement. For a correct optical model and in the absence ofmeasurement errors, the measurand calculated from the optical model coincides with the measurand (raw datavalue1 ) determined in the measurement.7.1.2 The set of adjusted parameter values is the measurement result (i.e. the converted measurement data 1determined by the ellipsometric measurement). In some special cases the measurement result can be calculated fromthe measurands or raw data analytically.7.1.3 Typically, in ellipsometry the analysis is performed by calculating the expected value of the measurand (i.e.raw data value from the parameter values provided in the optical model). The parameter values of interest within theoptical model are then intentionally adjusted in a manner such that optimum consistency between the calculated andmeasured value of the measurand (i.e. the raw data value is obtained). The adjusted parameter values are themeasurement result (i.e. the converted measurement data).7.2 Definition of the Optical Parameters  The optical parameters are used as substrate data set and the optimizedparameter values after measurement and analysis denote the measurement result (i.e. the converted measurementdata).7.2.1 layer index (i)  The layer index i identifies the layer for remote access. The index i = a describes theambient medium (n a, ka). The index i = s describes the substrate medium (n s, ks). The intermediate layers arenumbered in the direction from the substrate to the ambient (i.e. i = 1 denotes the first layer on the substrate) (seeFigure 2).7.2.2 n i  Denotes the refractive index of layer i being a positive real number.7.2.3 ki  Denotes the extinction coefficient of layer i. The value of the extinction coefficient ki must be set as apositive number |ki| for better readability in programs and printouts, independently of the notation of the complexrefractive index and complex dielectric function (see 7.2.4, 7.2.6, and 7.2.7).NOTE 3: The extinction coefficient k describes absorbing media if |k| &gt; 0 and transparent media if |k| = 0. The absorptioncoefficient and the absorption index are also two common optical parameters used for describing absorbing media. Theextinction coefficient k is related to the absorption coefficient by = 4k/ and to the absorption index by = k/n.7.2.4 Ni  Denotes the complex refractive index of layer i. Depending on the physical notation the complexrefractive index is calculated by Ni = n i  j ki or Ni = n i + j ki (see 7.2.3).7.2.5i = Ni2  Complex dielectric function of layer i.7.2.61i = n i2  ki2  Real part of the dielectric function of layer i.7.2.72i  Imaginary part of the dielectric function of layer i. Depending on the physical notation, the imaginarypart of the dielectric function is calculated by2i = 2niki or2i = 2niki (see 7.2.4, 7.2.5). The value of theimaginary part of the dielectric function2i must be set as a positive number |2 i| for better readability in programsand printouts, independently of the notation of the complex refractive index and complex dielectric function (see7.2.3, 7.2.4, and 7.2.5).7.2.8 ti  Metric thickness of the layer i. The method for counting is identical as for the refractive indices, but nothickness is provided for the ambient and the substrate.7.3 ambient medium  The modeling always requires a semi-infinite space (or material) for the incident and thereflected beam that is not part of the sample. The ambient is the propagation medium immediately before and afterreflection at the sample surface. In many cases the ambient medium is air or vacuum with n a = 1 and ka = 0. 4 Terminology here is as defined in SEMI E127.

SEMI E141-0705 © SEMI 20057 7.4 material and layer definition  the optical properties of a material determine how the complex refractive indexNi is given as a function of wavelength and environmental parameters (e.g., temperature). A layer consists of asingle material or a combination of several materials with a metric thickness ti. This definition also applies tocomplex structures as index gradients, interfaces, and roughness that can be modeled as a series of layers.7.5 substrate medium  Lowest (see 7.2.1) material involved in the reflection with a complex refractive index Ns .A sample has only one substrate material, which is treated as semi-infinite.7.6 Ellipsometric Measurand (raw data set) 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 7.6.1 r p = Erp /Eip  Complex amplitude reflection coefficient parallel to the plane of incidence.7.6.2 r s = Ers /Eis  Complex amplitude reflection coefficient perpendicular to the plane of incidence.7.6.3 = rp /r s = tan  ej  Ratio of the complex amplitude reflection coefficients.7.6.4p  Phase shift of Erp relative to Eip.7.6.5s  Phase shift of Ers relative to Eis.7.6.6 =p -s  Phase shift between p and s components of the electric field strength.7.6.7 tan = | rp | /|r s |  Ratio of the absolute values of the amplitude reflection coefficients.7.6.8 S x  Stokes parameters (x = 0, 1, 2, 3).NOTE 4: The four Stokes parameters describe the polarization ellipse using the physical dimension of energy. The four Stokesparameters involve three independent parameters that are necessary to describe the polarization ellipse. For totally polarized light,the Stokes parameters describe a sphere with the radius S 0 and represent the parameters and in a Cartesian coordinatesystem: S02 = S12 + S22 + S32. The parameter S 0 is proportional to the energy of the light wave. For elliptically and totallypolarized light, the Stokes parameters are calculated from the parameters and as follows: S1 =  S0 cos 2, S2 = S 0 sin 2cos, and S 3 = S 0 sin 2 sin. The Stokes vector, consists of four vector components, which are the Stokes parameters.7.6.9 s x = S x /S 0  normalized Stokes parameters (x = 1, 2, 3).NOTE 5: The normalized Stokes parameters are calculated from the Stokes parameters as follows: s1 = S1/S0, s2 = S2/S0, and s3 =S 3/S0.7.6.10 The results are typically given as \[,\](0,, ), \[tan, cos\](0,, ), \[s1, s2, s3\](0 ,, ) dependenton the measurement angle of incidence0, and the wavelength (see 3.4). The parameter array provides allenvironmental conditions (influence quantities) relevant for the measurement. All relevant parameters shall beprovided in SI units. At least the sample temperature must be specified, but additional parameters (e.g. ambientpressure, measurement time, sample orientation, the measurement position10, composition, and strain) may have tobe added.7.7 Qualification of Ellipsometric Data7.7.1 The qualification of an ellipsometer is verified by measuring certified reference samples and test procedures11, 12, 13, 14 . 5 Born, M.; Wolf, E.: Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light, CambridgeUniversity Press, ISBN 0521642221.6 Azzam, R.

For thicknessmeasurements typical samples are thermal oxides on silicon ranging from 4 nm to 800 nm. For refractive index measurements,the reference sample thickness is typically in the range from 80 nm to 500 nm.NOTE 7: SEMI MF576-01 was originally published by ASTM International as ASTM F 576-78. It was formally approved byASTM balloting procedures and adhered to ASTM patent requirements. Though ownership of this standard has been transferredto SEMI, it has not been formally approved by SEMI balloting procedures and does not adhere either to SEMI Regulationsdealing with patents or to SEMI Editorial Guidelines. It was available at www.semi.org, last published by ASTM International asASTM F 576-01. Hence in SEMI MF576-01, the notation for parameters required in data acquisition and modeling is aligned butcould not retroactively be fully harmonized with the definitions specified in the presented guide. This does not constitute anyconstraints since these few parameters may easily be superseded by the newer definitions provided.7.7.2 Whenever the thickness and refractive index measurement (if performed) is within specified limits for thereference sample, the ellipsometer is defined as qualified and hence capable of measuring the respective type ofsample.7.7.3 The qualification status of an ellipsometer is defined and must be specified by providing the followingparameters: (1) the relevant parameters for sample identification, (2) the relevant optical parameters of the sample,(3) the expected measurement result, (4) the actual measurement result, (5) the tolerated deviation between theactual and the expected measurement result, (6) all relevant parameters of the ellipsometer system (e.g. all relevantparameters of the positions of the optical components) the angle of incidence, and (7) all relevant environmentalparameters.7.7.4 Recommended Units and Symbols  The units as listed in Table 1 are recommended for the description of thelisted parameter.Table 1 Recommended Units Physical Quantity Symbol Unit(s)Metric thickness t m, nm, Wavelength m, nm, Photon energy E eVWave number cm-1Angles,,0,p,c,PEM,A ° or deg (360° are a full circle)Electric field vectors E ip , E is, E rp , E rs V/mOptical parameters (refractive indices) N, n, k no unitComplex dielectric function no unitPseudo  &lt;&gt; no unit#1 See SEMI E30.5 for the preferred thickness unit ().#2 The pseudo dielectric constant &lt;&gt; is calculated from the raw data set using a sample model consisting of only the ambient and substratewithout layers.

SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 19991 SEMI E4-0699SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 1 MESSAGETRANSFER (SECS-I) This standard was technically approved by the Global Information & Control Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Information & Control Committee. Current edition approved by theNorth American Regional Standards Committee on February 28, 1999. Initially available at www.semi.orgMay 1999; to be published June 1999. Originally published in 1980; previously published January 1999. 1 Introduction1.1 Revision History  This is the first major revisionsince the original release of SECS-I in 1980. Very littleof the original intent of SECS-I has been altered,although there are a few significant additions. Thechanges are summarized in Appendix 1. Thisspecification has been developed in cooperation withthe Japan Electronic Industry Development AssociationCommittee 12 on Equipment Communications.1.2 Scope  The SECS-I standard defines acommunication interface suitable for the exchange ofmessages between semiconductor processing equipmentand a host. Semiconductor processing equipmentincludes equipment intended for wafer manufacturing,wafer processing, process measuring, assembly andpackaging. A host is a computer or network ofcomputers which exchange information with theequipment to accomplish manufacturing. This standardincludes the description of the physical connector,signal levels, data rate and logical protocols required toexchange messages between the host and equipmentover a serial point-to-point data path. This standarddoes not define the data contained within a message.The meaning of messages must be determined throughsome message content standard such as SEMIEquipment Communications Standard E5 (SECS-II).1.3 Intent  This standard provid es a means forindependent manufacturers to produce equipmentand/or hosts which can be connected without requiringspecific knowledge of each other.1.3.1 Layered Protocol  The SEC S-I protocol canbe thought of as a layered protocol used for point-to-point communication. The levels within SECS-I are thephysical link, block transfer protocol, and messageprotocol. (See Related Information R1-1.1.)1.3.2 Speed  It is not the intent of this standard tomeet the communication needs of all possibleapplications. For example, the speed of RS-232 may beinsufficient to meet the needs of transferring massamounts of data or programs in a short period of time,such as might be required by high speed functional testapplications. 1.3.3 Network Support  The meth od by whichblocks of data are routed to a piece of equipment or findtheir way back to the proper host application is notspecified by SECS-I. In a network, the roles of host andequipment might be assumed by any party in thenetwork. In this situation, one end of thecommunications link must assume the role of theequipment and the other the role of the host.1.4 Applicable Documents1.4.1 Electronics Industries Associa tion Standards1EIA RS-232-C  Interface between Data TerminalEquipment and Data Communication EquipmentEmploying Serial Binary Data InterchangeEIA RS-269-B  Synchronous Signaling Rates forData TransmissionEIA RS-334  Signal Quality at Interface BetweenData Processing Terminal Equipment and SynchronousCommunication Equipment for Serial DataTransmissionEIA RS-422  Electrical Characteristics of BalancedVoltage Digital Interface CircuitsEIA RS-423  Electrical Characteristics ofUnbalanced Voltage Digital Interface Circuits 1.4.2 European Computer Manufact uring Association2ECMA/TC24/82/18  "Network Layer Principles,"Final Draft (April, 1982) 1.4.3 Japanese Industrial Standards Committees3JIS C 6361  "The Interface between Data CircuitTerminating Equipment (DCE) and Data TerminalEquipment (DTE) (25-pin Interface)" 1.4.4 International Organization for Standardization4 1 EIA Engineering Department, Standards Sales Office, 2001 EyeStreet, N.W., Washington, D.C. 200062 European Computer Manufacturing Association, 114 Rue du Rhone,1204 Geneva, Switzerland3 Japanese Standards Association, 1-24, Akasaka 4 Chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo 107, Japan4 ANSI, 1430 Broadway, New York, NY 10018

The actual transmissionconsists of 8-bit bytes sent serially with one start andone stop bit. The communication is bidirectional andasynchronous, but flows in one direction at a time. Thedirection is established by special characters and ahandshake, after which the data itself is sent. Data issent in blocks of 254 bytes or less. Each block consistsof a 10-byte header followed by data. A message is acomplete unit of communication in one direction andconsists of 1 to 32,767 blocks. Each block headercontains information for identifying the block as part ofa specific message. Messages are paired by a requestand its reply which together are called a transaction.1.6 Structure of Document  This document isdivided into sections which correspond to major aspectsof the standard. The sections outline requirements aswell as implications of the requirements. The standardmay be implemented in a variety of ways, dependingupon the computer environment where it is placed.Implementation is not part of the standard.

No restrictions are implied for any interfaceother than for equipment covered by this standard. 3.2 Electrical Interface  The co nnection will includea serial interface according to EIA Standard RS-232-Cfor interface Type E, full duplex communication,modified by the deletions, additions and exceptionsdescribed in this section.3.2.1 Connector  Either the 9-pin or 25-pinconnector described in the EIA RS232 may be used. Inthe case of the 25-pin connector a female connector willbe mounted on the equipment and a male connector willbe mounted on the cable from the host. In the case ofthe 9-pin connector the male connector will be mountedon the equipment and a female connector will bemounted on the cable. The connector on the equipmentwill have female 4-40 threaded jack screw locks.NOTE: Suitable 25-pin connectors known as Type "D" aresimilar to Amphenol MIN RAC 17 series with jack screwlocks. Suitable 9-pin connector is also Type "D" withjackscrew locks. It is the type commonly implemented ondesktop and notebook PCs. 3.2.2 Signal Pins  Pins on the con nector havefunctions as defined in Table 1. Pins 1, 2, 3, and 7 ofthe 25-pin connector or pins 3, 2, and 5 of the 9-pinconnector are required for all equipment complyingwith SECS-I. When using a 25-pin connector, the twopower supply pins, 18 and 25, are optional as indicated.Any other pins, if used, shall comply with the RS-232-C standard. Table 1 Signal Connections 25-Pin9-Pin RS-232-CCircuitCircuit Description 1 -- AA Shield2 3 BA Data from Equipment3 2 BB Data to Equipment7 5 AB Signal Ground18 -- -- +12 to +15 volts (opt forthe 25-pin connector)25 -- -- -12 to -15 volts (opt forthe 25-pin connector) 3.2.3 Logic Levels  For the signal pins 2 and 3, thelogic 1 level will be a voltage less than -3 volts and thelogic 0 level will be a voltage greater than +3 volts.Voltages will never exceed ± 25 volts. These valuescorrespond to those specified by the RS-232-Cstandard.3.2.4 Power Supplies  When usin g a 25-pinconnector, pins 18 and 25 are optional power suppliesfor driving external isolation circuits. When provided,both shall be present and must be able to supply at least50 mA. (See Related Information R1-2 for exampleuse.)

SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 1999 4 3.3 Data Rate  The supported d ata rates on signalpins shall be 9600, 4800, 2400, 1200, and 300 baud.The same data rate shall apply for data sent to and fromthe equipment. The data rate shall be controlled tobetter than 0.5%. (See RS-269-B and RS-334.) Optionalrates of 19,200 and 150 baud may be supplied ifdesired.3.4 Physical Medium  The conn ection with the hostmay involve any medium that provides the required RS-232-C quality, signal levels and data rate at the equip-ment connector. The quality of signal should be suchthat the effective bit error rate is less than 1  10 -6 . Thisrate can be achieved easily with hardwired systems.The distance limits specified in RS-232-C apply only tosystems using the wiring technique described in RS-232-C. Since any method may be used in SECS-I aslong as RS-232-C signals are supplied at the connector,the distance and isolation is dependent upon the designof the physical medium which is external to the SECS-Istandard. (See Related Information R1-2.) 4 Character Structure4.1 Characters  Data will be tra nsmitted or receivedin a serial bit stream of 10 bits per character at one ofthe specified data rates. The standard character has onestart bit (0), 8 data bits and one stop bit (1). All bittransmissions are of the same duration. The 8 data bitsare numbered from 1 to 8 in the order sent (see Figure1). The timing between characters is asynchronous withrespect to the data rate. The 8 data bits may be anyarbitrary code. The eight data bits will hereafter bereferred to as a byte. Figure 1Character Structure 4.2 Weighted Codes  For bytes h aving weightedcodes, bit one is the least significant and bit eight is themost significant. The most common weighted code isbinary.4.3 Non-Weighted Codes  For c odes withoutnumeric value such as ASCII, the bit numbers will beused as the entry into a standard code table forinterpretation of the code. SECS-I performs no parity orother verification of the contents of individual bytes. 5 Block Transfer Protocol5.1 The procedure used by the seri al line to establishthe direction of communication and provide theenvironment for passing message blocks is called theblock transfer protocol. Most of the protocol isaccomplished with a handshake of single bytes. Whenboth ends of the line try to send at the same time, acondition known as line contention exists. The protocolresolves contention by forcing one end of the line,designated as the slave (always the host), to postponeits transmission and enter the receive mode.Retransmission of blocks is used to correctcommunication errors. The block transfer protocol isshown in flow chart form in Figure 2, and describedbelow. Additional information is also contained inRelated Information R1-3 and R1-4.5.2 Handshake Bytes  The four standard handshakecodes used in the block transfer protocol are shown inTable 2. The three letter names, ENQ, EOT, ACK, andNAK correspond to the ASCII code having the samepattern. Table 2 Handshake Codes Name Codeb8b7.........b1Function ENQ 00000101 Request to SendEOT 00000100 Ready to ReceiveACK 00000110 Correct ReceptionNAK 00010101 Incorrect Reception 5.3 Timeout Parameters  Timeo uts are used to de-tect communications failures. A timeout occurs whenthe measured time between two events exceeds a pre-determined limit. Generally, the length of time thatmust pass before it can be assumed that an error has oc-curred depends upon the particular systems involved.The time required in one situation might be excessivelylong in another. Thus, the timeout values must be"tuned" to meet the application. In the block transferprotocol, there are two situations requiring timeout val-ues. The two timeout values are called parameters T1and T2.5.3.1 Inter-Character Timeout, T1  The inter-character timeout, T1, limits the time between receipt ofcharacters within a block after the length byte has beenreceived and until the receipt of the second checksumbyte.5.3.2 Protocol Timeout, T2  The p rotocol timeout,T2, limits the time between sending ENQ and receivingEOT, sending EOT and receiving the length byte, andsending the second checksum byte and receiving anycharacter.

SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 19995 5.4 Retry Limit, RTY  The retry limit, RTY, is themaximum number of times the Block Transfer Protocolwill attempt to retry sending a block before declaring afailed send. (See Section 5.8.2.)5.5 Master/Slave  The master/sl ave parameter isused in the resolution of contention (see Section 5.8.2).The host is designated as the slave. The equipment isdesig-nated as the master. This convention is basedupon the assumption that the equipment is less able tostore messages than the host.5.6 Block Lengths  The unsigne d integer value ofthe first byte sent after receipt of EOT is the length ofthe block being sent. The length includes all the bytessent after the length byte, excluding the 2 bytes of thechecksum. The maximum block length allowed bySECS-I is 254 bytes, and the minimum is 10 bytes.5.7 Checksum  The checksum is calculated as thenumeric sum of the unsigned binary values of all thebytes after the length byte and before the checksum in asingle block. The checksum is sent as 16 bits in twobytes following the last byte of the block data. The highorder eight bits of the checksum will be sent first,followed by the low order eight bits. The checksum isused by the receiver to check for transmission errors.The receiver performs the same checksum calculationon the received header and data.5.8 Algorithm  The operation of the block transferprotocol is best understood by following the logic flowin Figure 2. This flow chart depicts the operation of thefive states of the protocol - Receive, Idle, Send LineControl, and Completion. The flow chart shown in Fig-ure 2 is not meant to imply that a particular implemen-tation is required under this standard. However, anySECS-I block transfer protocol implementation must in-clude all the logic described in Figure 2. The samealgorithm is executed on each end of the SECS-Icommunications link.5.8.1 Idle State  Both ends of the communicationslink are assumed to start in the Idle state. There are twoprimary activities of the protocol signified by the twoexits from the Idle state. These are:A. SEND  a message block is to be sent.B. RECEIVE  the other end of the communicationslink has a message block to send 5.8.2 Line Control  The line contr ol section estab-lishes the transmission direction, resolves contention,and handles retries. When an ENQ is received in theIdle state, the Line Control responds with an EOT if theBlock Transfer Protocol is ready to receive. The BlockTransfer Protocol then goes to the Receive state. If amessage block is to be sent, then an ENQ is sent. If anEOT is received in response to the ENQ within the time limit T2, the Block Transfer Protocol goes to the Sendstate.5.8.2.1 If the slave receives an ENQ in response to theENQ, contention has occurred. The slave postpones thesend of its block until it receives a block from themaster. The slave prepares to receive the incomingblock and sends an EOT. When the block transferprotocol returns to the Idle state, the postponed blockSend may be sent as if it were a new send request. Aftera master sends an ENQ, it can ignore all charactersexcept an EOT. After a slave sends at ENQ, it canignore all characters except an ENQ or EOT.5.8.2.2 When the time between sendin g ENQ andreceiving EOT exceeds T2, or the time between sendingthe second checksum byte and receiving any characterexceeds T2, or a non-ACK character is received withintime T2 after sending the second checksum byte, theLine Control will increment the retry count ("tries" inthe flowchart). If the retry count does not exceed thevalue of the RTY parameter, then the Block TransferProtocol will retry sending the block beginning withENQ. If the retry count does exceed the value of theRTY parameter, then a failed send has occurred.5.8.3 Send  Once a send state is es tablished, the firstbyte sent is the length, N, of the data in the block. AfterN more bytes have been sent, the two bytes of thechecksum are sent. The sender computes the checksumbased on the data in the block and the block header, butnot the length byte. When the sender receives the ACKbefore time T2, the block is deemed properly sent.However, if the sender receives a non-ACK characterbefore time T2, or no character within time T2, itreturns to the line control state for a possible retry. Inthe Send state, characters received prior to sending thelast checksum byte can be ignored.5.8.4 Receive  Once a receive stat e is established,the first byte received is the length byte, N. Thereceiver counts and saves the following N + 2 bytes.The last two bytes are the checksum. The receivercompares the two checksum bytes against its owncomputation of the checksum. In a good block, thecomputed and received checksum are the same.5.8.5 Receive Completion  After a block is correctlyreceived, an ACK character is sent and the messageprotocol is notified that a block has been received. If T2is exceeded while waiting for the length character, or Tlis exceeded between characters being received, then anNAK is sent. If the length byte is invalid or if the re-ceived checksum does not agree with the computedchecksum, the receiver continues to listen for charactersto ensure that the sender is finished sending. This isdetected when the inter-character time exceeds T1, atwhich point the receive is aborted and a NAK is sent. In

&lt;!-- Page 44 --&gt;

SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 1999 6 any case when an NAK is sent, the receiver may dis-card any data it has received for the block. The receiverreturns immediately to the Idle state after sending anACK or NAK. 5.8.6 Send Completion  After the second checksumbyte is sent, if an ACK is received within time T2, themessage protocol is notified that the send was success-ful. If a failed send occurs, the message protocol is in-formed of the failure. Application-level software musttake the possibility of a send failure into account. Figure 2Block Transfer Protocol

SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 19997 6 Header Structure6.1 The operation of all communic ations functionsabove the block transfer protocol is linked toinformation contained in a 10-byte data element calledthe header. The header is always the first 10 bytes ofevery block sent by the block transfer protocol. Theinformation in the header is also used by the messageprotocol (see Section 7). The fixed format of the headeris described in this section. The general header structureis shown in Figure 3.NOTE: The header also contains information required bySECS-II. 6.2 Reverse Bit (R-Bit)  The rev erse bit (R-bit)signifies the direction of a message. The R-bit is set to 0for messages to the equipment and set to 1 for messagesto the host. The R-bit is included in the header so thatthe direction of the message is contained in every block. Figure 3Block Header Structure Table 3 Influence of the R-BIT R-Bit Device ID Message Direction0 Destination Host to Equipment1 Source Equipment to Host 6.3 Device ID  The device ID d efines the source ordestination of the message depending upon the value ofthe R-bit as shown in Table 3. Device identification is aproperty of the equipment and must be settableaccording to Section 8. The host can view the device IDas a logical identifier connected with a physical devicewithin the equipment. The host has no device ID.6.4 Wait Bit (W-Bit)  The wait b it (W-bit) is used toindicate that the sender of a primary message expects areply. A value of one in the W-bit means that a reply isexpected. A value of zero in the W-bit means that noreply is expected. The W-bit must be set to zero in allsecondary messages. For multi-block messages, thesender must ensure that the W-bit is the same in everyblock of the message.6.5 Message ID  The message I D identifies theformat and content of the message being sent (theparticular message is one of many possible for thedevice in question). The exact message content isequipment-dependent. The upper message ID is themost significant portion of the ID.6.5.1 Primary Message  A primar y message isdefined as any odd numbered message. An oddnumbered message will have bit 1 of the lower messageID set to 1.6.5.2 Secondary Message  A seco ndary message isdefined as any even numbered message. An even-numbered message will have bit 1 of the lower messageID set to 0.NOTE: In SECS-II, byte three of the header (excluding theW-bit) is known as the stream, and byte four of the header isknown as the function. See SECS-II for more information. 6.6 End Bit (E-Bit)  The end bit (E-bit) is used todetermine if a block is the last block of a message. Avalue of one in the E-bit means that the block is the lastblock. A value of zero means that more blocks are tofollow.6.7 Block Number  A message s ent as more thanone block is called a multi-block message. The firstblock is given a block number of one, and the blocknumber is incremented by one for each subsequentblock until the entire message is sent. The blocks of amulti-block message are sent in order. In a single-blockmessage, the block number must have a value of zero orone. The maximum block number is 32,767. The upperblock number is the most significant portion of theblock number. (See also 7.2.)6.8 System Bytes  The system by tes in the header ofeach message for a given device ID must satisfy thefollowing requirements. (For a further discussion ofsystem bytes, see Related Information R1-5.)

&lt;!-- Page 46 --&gt;

SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 1999 8 6.8.1 Distinction  The system byt es of a primarymessage must be distinct from those of all currentlyopen transactions initiated from the same end of thecommunications link. They must also be distinct fromthose of the most recently completed transaction. (SeeSection 7.3.) They must also be distinct from anysystem bytes of blocks that were not successfully sentsince the last successful block send.6.8.2 Reply Message  The system bytes of the replymessage are required to be the same as the system bytesof the corresponding primary message.6.8.3 Multi-Block Messages  The system bytes of allblocks of a multi-block message must be the same. 7 Message Protocol7.1 A message is a complete unit o f communication inone direction. The message protocol uses the servicesof the block transfer protocol to send and receivemessages. The message consists of the message datatogether with the following information from the header R-bit, device ID, W-bit, message ID, and systembytes.7.2 Message Send  When a mes sage is ready to besent, the message send protocol performs the functionsdescribed below. A block send failure terminates themessage protocol action on that message.7.2.1 Message Length  The maxim um data length ina single block of a message is 244 bytes. The maximumnumber of blocks that can be sent in a multi-blockmessage is 32,767, and so the maximum data lengthallowed in one message is 244  32,767 bytes.7.2.2 Message Blocking  Message blocking is thedivision of the message data into blocks to be sent tothe Block Transfer Protocol. For best performance, it isrecommended, but not required, that the sender fill allblocks of a multi-block message, except possibly thelast block, with the maximum 254 bytes. The receiverof a multi-block message should be able to accept anyblock size from 11 to 254 bytes, and should not requireconsecutive blocks necessarily to be the same size.7.2.2.1 Certain older implementations may imposeapplication-specific requirements on block sizes forcertain incoming messages. Beginning with the 1988revision of the standard, new applications may notimpose application-specific requirements on incomingblock sizes. Applications implemented before 1988may impose such requirements.NOTE: In SECS-II, certain messages are defined as single-block messages and must be sent as a single block in SECS-I. 7.2.3 Header  The message proto col must establishthe header in each block of the message according tothe requirements of Section 6.7.2.4 Interleaving Messages  This standard allows,but does not require, the support of more than oneconcurrent open transaction. This standard allows, butdoes not require, the support of interleaving the blocksof different multi-block messages. (See documentationrequirements in 9.)7.3 Transactions  A transaction is a primarymessage and an optional corresponding secondarymessage is called the reply. A transaction is openedwhen a primary message is ready to be sent. Atransaction is closed when the last block of a primarymessage requesting no reply has been sent, or when thelast block of the reply has been received.7.3.1 Reply Linking  When a reply is expected for aprimary message, the message protocol starts the replytimer for the transaction after the last block of themessage is successfully sent. When a primary messageis sent for which a reply is requested, an expected blockis established for the message receive algorithm. (SeeSection 7.4.) The expected block will have thecomplement of the R-bit, will have the same device ID,will be the first block of a secondary message, and willhave the same system bytes as those of the givenprimary message.NOTE: In SECS-II, the reply will have the same uppermessage ID (stream), and the lower message ID (function)will either be one greater than that of the correspondingprimary message, or it will be zero. 7.3.2 Reply Timeout, T3  The repl y timeout, T3, is alimit on the length of time that the message protocol iswilling to wait after the last block of a primary messagehas been sent and before the arrival of the first block ofthe reply. If the first block of the reply does not arrivewithin the T3 limit, the expected block is removed fromthe list of expected blocks, and the transaction isaborted. A timer, called the reply timer, is used tomeasure the time between the last block of the primarymessage and the first block of its reply. Each opentransaction for which a reply is expected requires aseparate reply timer.7.4 Message Receive  Each bloc k successfullyreceived by the block transfer protocol is passed to themessage protocol. It is the task of the message protocolto identify the blocks and assemble them into the propermessage.7.4.1 Routing Error  When a piec e of equipmentreceives a block of data which has a device ID in theblock header which does not match its own device IDand it has no other knowledge of this device ID, it canassume that the block was sent in error.

SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 19999 7.4.2 Duplicate Block Detection  A duplicate blockis a block which is exactly the same as the previousblock received by the Block Transfer Protocol. Thismay occur when the receiver has sent an ACK but, forsome reason, the ACK did not arrive in time at thesender, causing a send retry. A duplicate block isdetected by the SECS-I message protocol by comparingthe full 10-byte header of a block currently received bythe block transfer protocol with the header of the lastblock accepted as non-duplicate by the messageprotocol. If the headers are identical, the new block is aduplicate and should be discarded. If the headers aredifferent, the new block is a non-duplicate. The headerof the non-duplicate block saved for comparison withthe next block passed on by the block transfer protocol,and the block containing the header is further processedby the message receive algorithm.NOTE: Some implementations which follow the 1980 versionof SECS-I may not provide the unique headers required forduplicate block detection. An option for disabling theduplicate block detection is required to be compatible withthese systems. 7.4.3 Inter-Block Timeout T4  The time intervalbetween the successful receipt of a block in amultiblock message, and the successful receipt of thesubsequent block of the same message, is limited totime T4. If this time is exceeded, the message iscancelled and the transaction is aborted. A time calledthe inter-block timer is used to measure the timebetween block arrivals in the message protocol. Theremust be one inter-block timer for each open multi-blockmessage currently being received by the protocol. Aseach successive block of a message is received, thecorresponding inter-block timer is reset.7.4.4 Algorithm  When a block ar rives at themessage protocol, a combination of all the bytes in theheader is used to determine what to do with the block.The operation of the message receive algorithm is to beunderstood by following the logic flow in Figure 4. Theflow chart shown in Figure 4 and the description of thealgorithm below are not meant to imply that particularimplementation is required under this standard.However, any SECS-I message protocolimplementation must include all the logic shown inFigure 4 on page 11.7.4.4.1 The description of the message protocol usesthe concepts of an expected block. When a (properlyrouted and non-duplicate) block is received by themessage protocol, the first determination is whether theblock is one of the expected blocks or not. In order todetermine if a block is one of the expected blocks, the header information is compared with the headerinformation in a list of expected blocks.7.4.4.2 If the block is not one of the ex pected blocks,it must be the first block of a primary message,otherwise the block has been sent in error and can bediscarded. If the block is the first block of a primarymessage, and it is not the last block of the message (E-bit = 0), an inter-block timer for the given message isestablished and set, and the expected block for thegiven message is set to have the same R-bit, device ID,system bytes, W-bit, message ID, and a block numberone greater than that of the block just received.7.4.4.3 If the block is one of the expec ted blocks, thenit is either the first block of a reply message or it is partof an open message.7.4.4.4 If the block is the first block o f a replymessage, the reply timer for the given message iscancelled. For the first block of a reply message, theexpected block will have block number one (or possiblyzero if the reply is a single block message) and will be asecondary message, but the full message ID isundetermined. (See Section 7.3.1.)7.4.4.5 If the block is the last block of the givenmessage (E-bit = 1), the message is complete. If themessage is a primary message for which a reply isrequested (W-bit = 1), the system bytes are saved forsending with the reply message. (See Section 7.2.3.)7.4.4.6 If the block is not the last bloc k of the message(E-bit = 0), then the inter-block timer for the givenmessage is reset, and the (next) expected block for thegiven message is set to have the same R-bit, device ID,system bytes, W-bit, message ID, and a block numberone greater than that of the block just received. 8 Parameter Setting8.1 The eight protocol parameters are listed in Table 4.The selection of baud rate should be based on systemperformance. The value of the device ID is determinedby the particular system requirements and is generallyunique within one factory. The values of the next fiveparameters are determined by the performancecharacteristics of the host system and the baud rate ofthe communication channel. The first seven parametersmust be adjustable by the user. All parameters must bestored in such a manner that the settings will be retainedif the power fails or if the system software is reloaded.The range and resolution of protocol parameters mustbe at least as shown in Table 4. The M/S parameter isset to master in the equipment and to slave in the host.
