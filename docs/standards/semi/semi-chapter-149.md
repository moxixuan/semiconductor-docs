SEMI MF1527-1104 © SEMI 2003, 20047 correction factor for such geometries varies rapidlywith thickness (see Section 8.6).8.3.1 Because of the relative insensitivity of thecalculated center-point resistivity to the exact value ofdiameter for large diameter wafers, it is usuallyadequate to assume the nominal diameter of standardcommercially available wafers specified in accordancewith SEMI M1. However, diameter correction factorsare usually required for off-center resistivitymeasurements made in accordance with SEMI MF81.When required, diameter measurements should be madeat the positions outlined in SEMI MF2074.8.4 Axial Resistivity Uniformity  The uniformity ofthe resistivity along the crystal axis is important for allapplications in which the sampling volume of themeasuring instrument in the direction perpendicular tothe wafer surface is different from that of the certifyingor calibrating instrument. In addition, gross axialuniformity along a crystal section may be ascertained inorder to qualify the section as a source of resistivityreference wafers of a particular resistivity prior toslicing the section.8.4.1 Very crude indications of the range of center-point resistivity within a crystal section may beobtained from measurements made on the ends of thesection in accordance with the Four-probe Method ofSEMI MF43. While these measurements provide auseful preliminary screen for the crystal section, theycannot be relied upon to give accurate values ofresistivity.8.4.2 Somewhat more accurate but still grossindications of axial resistivity uniformity may beobtained from measurements of the resistivity at thecenter of wafers in accordance with SEMI MF84 as afunction of position along the crystal section. However,because of local fluctuations in dopant incorporation asthe crystal was grown, this procedure does not yieldreliable information about the center-point resistivity ofany wafer that is not measured. In addition, it does notyield information about the local variation in resistivityas a function of depth from the wafer surface, even ifcenter-point resistivity measurements are made on eachwafer in the section.8.4.3 For use in connection with measurements inwhich the sampling volume differs from the samplingvolume of an in-line four-point probe with 1.59\[10/(2)\] mm spacing as specified in SEMI MF84,transfer accuracy is affected by local resistivityuniformity. In particular, the resistivity in the near-surface region sampled by spreading resistance ormercury probes may differ significantly from theaverage resistivity of the resistivity reference wafer.Depth profiles of resistivity near the wafer surface may be obtained from spreading resistance measurements onbeveled sections in accordance with SEMI MF672. Toobtain depth profiles across the entire wafer, spreadingresistance measurements can be made on a cleaved orpolished perpendicular section; special fixtures arerequired for these measurements, which do not providethe depth resolution of an angle beveled section. Sincerelative measurements only are required, accuratecalibration of the spreading resistance probe is notnecessary; however, linearity is important. Twodifficulties with this approach must be recognized.First, if beveled specimens are employed, thepossibility of mixing the vertical and horizontalresistivity variations must be considered. Second,because the method is destructive, the resistivityvariation of the actual material being used for theresistivity reference wafer cannot be determineddirectly at the center of a resistivity reference wafer; itcan only be inferred from measurements on nearbysections or adjacent wafers.8.5 Radial Resistivity Uniformity  The uniformity ofthe resistivity along the surface of the resistivityreference wafer is important for all applications inwhich the measuring instrument samples a differentarea than the certifying or calibrating instrument. Sinceall resistivity measurements other than those conductedin accordance with SEMI MF84, including four-pointprobe measurements made with probes with differentprobe-tip spacing, sample different areas, this factor isone of the most significant limitations in transfer ofresistivity values from one instrument to another.8.5.1 Large scale (macro) variations in resistivityacross the surface of a wafer can be measured with afour-point probe.8.5.1.1 Coarse indications can be obtained using an in-line four-point probe in accordance with SEMI MF81modified to yield a nine-site map of resistivity variationover the central 38-mm diameter region of the wafer.In addition to four-point probes, eddy currentinstruments are frequently used for thesemeasurements. Although the procedures for using eddycurrent instruments for measuring resistivity variationare not standardized, they provide an adequate measureof radial resistivity variation, especially in the centralregion of the wafer where edge effects are notsignificant. Although more dense patterns may bemeasured, they are very inconvenient to obtainmanually using either a four-point probe or an eddycurrent instrument.8.5.1.2 Several commercial automated mappinginstruments that utilize dual-configuration, in-line, four-

&lt;!-- Page 2 --&gt;

SEMI MF1527-1104 © SEMI 2003, 2004 8 point probes 5 or square-array four-point probes7 areavailable. These instruments provide for collection ofsufficient data to enable determination of the macro-scale variation of the sheet resistance in detail adequatefor the application. Measurements should be taken in a49-site pattern consisting of the center point and siteson three equally spaced, concentric circles as specifiedin SEMI MF1618. In this pattern the inner, middle, andouter circles have 8, 16, and 24 sites, respectively. Thenominal diameter of the outer circle should be 38 mm(Note 5). Procedures for measurements with square-array four-point probes have not been standardized.Dual-configuration sheet resistance measurementsusing in-line four-point probes should be made inaccordance with SEMI MF1529. Since the thicknesscorrection factor is not established for dual-configuration probes, the resistivity at eachmeasurement site cannot be calculated accurately.However, provided that the wafer thickness issufficiently uniform, determination of the sheetresistance is adequate for this application becauserelative values are all that are required to establish thevariation.8.5.2 Micro-scale variations in resistivity across thesurface of a wafer can be established by means ofspreading resistance measurements made in accordancewith SEMI MF525. It is especially important tominimize such variations in material to be used asresistivity reference wafers for spreading resistancecalibrations. Because of the high density of data pointsrequired to obtain information on micro-scale variationsover a meaningful area, long times are required formaking these measurements.NOTE 5: If it is desired to qualify a larger area of a wafer foruse in preparing chip sets for spreading resistance calibration,the uniformity of both resistivity and thickness should bedetermined over the larger area of the wafer. Fordeterminations of macro-scale radial resistivity uniformity, itis recommended that, as a minimum, the site density used inevaluating the central region of the wafer (see Section 8.5.1.2)be maintained. Table 1 lists the minimum number of sitesrequired for areas of various diameters. Micro-scalevariations should also be determined over the larger area, butbecause it is impractical to make detailed micro-scalevariation measurements on each wafer, each chip should beevaluated for micro-scale resistivity variations prior to use.8 7 Swartzendruber, L. J.,Correction Factor Tables for Four-pointProbe Resistivity Measurements on Thin, Circular SemiconductorSamples, NBS Technical Note 199, April 1964, 42 pp. Availablefrom the National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA22161, as AD 683 408.8 Ehrstein, J. R., Standard Reference Materials: Preparation andCertification of SRM's for Calibration of Spreading ResistanceProbes, NBS Special Publication 260-93, January 1985, 30 pp.Available from the National Technical Information Service,Springfield, VA 22161, as PB 85-177921. 8.6 Wafer Thickness  Resistivity reference wafersshould be thick enough to avoid extreme fragility and toallow determination of the center-point thickness to±0.25% but not too thick to require large corrections tothe thin wafer equation for resistivity (see Section R2-3.2). A thickness of 625 to 875 m is recommended forresistivity reference wafers. Wafers with thickness assmall as 500 m may be used, but particular attentionmust be given to control of the total thickness variation(see Section 9.1.1).Table 1 Minimum Number of Sites for EvaluatingMacro-Scale Resistivity VariationDiameter of Area to beEvaluated, mmMinimum Number of Sites inMap51 8163 12176 16989 225101 289 8.6.1 For four-point probes with 1.59-mm probe-tipspacing as specified in SEMI MF84, the thicknesscorrection factor is within 0.5% of unity for testspecimens up to 875-m thick. For probes with 1.016-mm (40-mil) spacing, the thickness correction is about1% for a test specimen thickness of 625 m, increasingto about 5% at 875 m. For probes with 0.635-mm(25-mil) spacing, the thickness correction is about 7.5%at a thickness of 625 m, increasing to nearly 20% at875 m.8.6.2 The thickness enters into the determination of theresistivity of the reference wafer directly as anindependent factor. Therefore determination ofthickness should be made as accurately as possible. Ifmanual methods are used for determining radialresistivity uniformity (see Section 8.5.1.1), the averagethickness and total thickness variation should bedetermined in accordance with the contactless methodof Test Methods SEMI MF533 using the same sites forthe thickness and resistivity measurements. Thismethod, however, has only marginal precision for thisapplication. If automated methods are used fordetermining radial resistivity uniformity (see Section8.5.1.2), the average thickness and total thicknessvariation should be determined over the central 38-mmdiameter circle (Note 5) in accordance with SEMIMF1530.8.6.3 The various errors in resistivity determinationthat result from uncertainties in thickness are discussedin Section R2-3.2.

SEMI MF1527-1104 © SEMI 2003, 20049 8.7 Wafer Conductivity Type and Surface Orientation For control of four-point probes or for calibratingeddy current probes, conductivity type and surfaceorientation do not influence the result. In this casethese parameters should be chosen so as to provide themost uniform specimens available. For low resistivityreference wafers, p-type (100) or (111) wafers are mostappropriate, while for high resistivity reference wafers,n-type (neutron transmutation doped) wafers of eitherorientation are preferred. For use in calibratingmercury probes, the conductivity type of the referencewafers must match that of the specimens to be tested.For use in calibrating spreading resistance instruments,the type and surface orientation of the reference wafersmust match those of the specimens to be tested.NOTE 6: When uniformity considerations are the dominantissue, the following should be kept in mind. At lowresistivity, wafers cut from Cz crystal are not only morereadily available but probably have better uniformity thanwafers cut from FZ crystals. Wafers cut from MCz crystals,if available, may be an acceptable alternative to NTD wafersfor the higher resistivity ranges. In general, (100) crystalshave better radial resistivity uniformity than (111) crystals.Also p-type crystals have generally better radial resistivityuniformity than n-type crystals. 9 Preparation and Calibration of ResistivityReference Wafers9.1 Wafer Preparation  Wafers should be slicedfrom a qualified crystal section of the desiredresistivity, diameter, conductivity type, and orientation.The thickness of the as-cut wafers should be at least100 m larger than the desired finished thickness toallow for removal of 25 m from each surface duringboth etching and lapping. Etching immediately afterslicing in either KOH etching solution (see Section 5.4)or etching solution (15 + 1) (see Section 5.5) isrecommended to remove damage introduced duringslicing. Subsequent lapping with 5 to 9-m aluminumoxide abrasive is intended to provide both control ofthickness variation and a uniform matte surface.9.1.1 The total thickness variation (TTV) of resistivityreference wafers should be as small as possible. As aminimum, the reference wafers should meet the TTVrequirement of ±1 % of the center-point thickness asspecified in SEMI MF84. For 625-m thick wafers,this would require TTV ≤ 12.5 m. In most cases, itshould be possible to obtain lapped wafers with TTV ≤6 m over the entire wafer and TTV ≤ 3 m (± 0.25%of the center-point thickness) over the region of thewafer where the resistivity uniformity is determined(see Section 8.5.1.2). Etched or single-side polishedwafers may have somewhat larger TTV. 9.1.2 The preferred surface finish is that obtained bylapping with 5-m alumina powder as specified inSEMI MF84; generally similar results can be obtainedby lapping with alumina powders up to 9 m. Thissurface finish was originally chosen to provide goodprobe-tip and specimen-surface wear together withsufficient smoothness to reduce probe wander.9However, resistivity reference wafers intended forcalibration of mercury probe and spreading resistanceinstruments must be polished. On the other hand, ifpolished wafers are used for four-point probemeasurements, difficulties may be encountered withaccumulated probe damage and the resultant contactquality degradation or surface charge, or both.However, use of instruments calibrated with lappedresistivity reference wafers for measuring polishedwafers could result in errors because the electricalthickness may be different for lapped and polishedwafers of the same mechanical thickness.NOTE 7: An unpublished roughness-thickness correlationstudy has shown that the electrical thickness of lapped waferswith root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness &lt; 0.58 m onboth sides does not differ from the mechanical thickness bymore than 2.5 m. 9.2 Calibration9.2.1 Determine that the candidate resistivity referencewafer meets the resistivity uniformity requirementsappropriate to the intended application or applications(see Sections 8.1, 8.4, and 8.5).9.2.2 Determine the resistivity of the candidatereference wafer at its center in accordance with SEMIMF84 except that (1) thickness should be measured inaccordance with Section 8.6.2, (2) each determinationshould consist of m measurements, where 6 ≤ m ≤ 10,taken with the wafer rotated about (360/m) deg betweeneach measurement, and (3) wafers with a surface finishthat results in stable, reproducible measurements maybe used. If the measurement is made on an etched orpolished surface, equivalence with the result that wouldhave been obtained using a lapped surface must bedemonstrated.9.2.3 Calculate the average resistivity corrected to23°C in accordance with SEMI MF84 and the samplestandard deviation of the six to ten individual resistivitymeasurements (corrected to 23°C).9.2.4 If the resistivity reference wafer is to be used forcalibrating a mercury probe system, convert thetemperature-corrected average resistivity value to netcarrier density using the computational method given in 9 Hargreaves, J. K., and Millard, D., The Accuracy of Four-probeResistivity Measurements on Silicon, Brit. J. Appl. Phys. 13, 231234 (1962).

In general, singlemeasurement determinations of resistivity are made forroutine purposes; therefore, the control should becarried out on this basis. Established procedures shouldbe used for generating and maintaining the individualsand moving range control charts, for determining theexistence of out-of-control conditions, and taking theappropriate corrective action. A suggested procedure isgiven in Section R1-4 for use in organizations withoutpreviously established procedures. 11 Operator Training Requirements11.1 Personnel responsible for selection and calibrationof resistivity reference wafers should be skilled in thefollowing areas:11.1.1 Operation of four-point probe resistivitymeasurement apparatus, including familiarity withSEMI MF84 or DIN 50431,11.1.2 Sources of radial and longitudinal resistivityvariations in silicon crystal,11.1.3 Operation of resistivity mapping apparatus,manual or automatic, as appropriate, Table 2 Summary of Test Methods Applicable to Resistivity and Related MeasurementsMeasurement Equipment Applicable Test Method(s)In-line Four-point Probe SEMI MF84 or DIN 50431Non-contact Eddy-current Gage SEMI MF673, DIN 50445 or DIN 50447Spreading Resistance Probe SEMI MF525 or SEMI MF672Mercury Probe SEMI MF1392, SEMI MF1393 or DIN 50439Dual-configuration Four-point Probe SEMI MF1529

It was derived frominformation developed during the original preparation of the standard in ASTM Committee F-1 in 1994.This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures. R1-1 Types of Control ChartsR1-1.1 Three types of control charts are employed forvarious purposes in connection with the use ofresistivity reference wafers.R1-1.2 Two X and s charts are used for the control ofprimary resistivity measuring instruments. One of theseis the usual type of chart for which the control limits areestablished from measurements made with theinstrument (see Section 7.1.1). The second, intended toensure traceability, differs from the usual control chartin that it has limits that are based not on themeasurements themselves but instead on thecharacteristics of the CRMs used for the measurements(see Section 7.1.2). These two types of control chartsare of the types intended to provide control with nostandard given and control with respect to a givenstandard, respectively.10 R1-1.3 The third type of chart is one based onindividual measurements and the moving range, whichis the difference between one measurement and thenext. The control limits for this chart are based on themeasurements. This type of chart is used for control ofinstruments for routine resistivity measurements (seeSection 10.2). R1-2 Control Charts for Primary ResistivityMeasuring InstrumentsR1-2.1 Since there is no standard given for thesecharts, the limits are based on the initial series ofresistivity determinations. First, select an appropriatenumber of measurements (six to ten) for the resistivitydetermination, and make the same number ofmeasurements for each determination. Beginconstruction of the instrument X and s charts bymaking 25 to 30 center-point resistivity determinationsin accordance with the procedure of Section 7.1.1 onone or more resistivity reference wafers covering theresistivity range of the specimens to be measured. If noother acceptable material is available, CRMs or othercommercially obtained calibrated wafers can beemployed until suitable reference wafers have been 10 Manual on Presentation of Data and Control Chart Analysis:MNL 7, 6th Edition, (ASTM, West Conshohocken, PA, (1991) 3-3. prepared. Measurements should be taken regularly,every day or every shift, as appropriate. If variationsbetween operators are suspected, separate control chartsshould be maintained by different operators.R1-2.2 Record the date, time, sample identification,operator, number of separate resistivity measurements(six to ten), m; each resistivity value obtained, Xij; theaverage of each group of m measurements, ;iX and thesample standard deviation of each group, si.NOTE 1: The average and standard deviation of each groupof measurements are obtained as follows:  = =    == mjmjiijiiji XXmsXmX1 12)(11and1 R1-2.3 Construct X and s run charts of these data foreach wafer measured by plotting on separate graphs thevalues of X and s in the order in which they wereobtained as shown in Figure R1-1.R1-2.4 Calculate the grand averages, X and s of theiX and si values, respectively, as follows:  ==== ni ini i snsXnX 111and1 (R1-1) where:n = number of measurements (25 to 30, see SectionR1-2.1).Take these grand averages as the central lines of the Xand s control charts, respectively.R1-2.5 Determine the upper and lower control limitsfor the X control chart from the following equations:11 sAXLCLsAXUCL 33 and =+= (R1-2)where:UCL = upper control limit,LCL = lower control limit, and 11 Manual on Presentation of Data and Control Chart Analysis:MNL 7, 6th Edition, (ASTM, West Conshohocken, PA, (1991) 3-9,Tables 5 and Tables 6.

It was derived frominformation developed during the original preparation of the standard in ASTM Committee F-1 in 1994.This related information was approved for publication by the Silicon Wafer Committee on July 15, 2004. R2-1 The resistance of an infinitely thin uniform sheetof infinite extent as measured with an equal spaced, in-line four-point probe is given as follows: 2lnms IV = (R2-1) where:s = resistance of the infinite sheet, Ω, and(V/I)m = average of the forward and reverse voltage-current ratios, Ω.The resistivity of the sheet can be obtained bymultiplying the sheet resistance by the sheet thicknessas follows: ws 410= (R2-2)where: = resistivity, Ωcm,s = resistance of the infinite sheet, Ω, andw = thickness, m.R2-2 Corrections to this equation can be made toobtain the resistivity of a wafer that has finite thicknessand diameter, as measured with a four-point probe withslightly unequal probe-tip spacings with an averagevalue of S at a temperature slightly different from thereference temperature. The general solution to thisproblem must take account of its three-dimensionalaspect. Solutions are available for the case of a semi-infinite medium or for an infinitely thin sheet. If thedeviation from the thin sheet approximation issufficiently small, the correction factors can bedetermined from independent solutions of two-dimensional electrostatic problems and multipliedtogether as follows: TspmC FFDSFSwwFIV=° 2ln10 423 (R2-3) where: 23°C = wafer resistivity at a reference temperatureof 23°C, Ωcm,w = wafer thickness, m,(V/I)m = average of the forward and reverse voltage-current ratios, Ω,F( S /D) = correction factor to account for finite waferdiameter (see Section R2-3.1),S = average probe-tip spacing, mm,D = wafer diameter, mm,F(w/ S ) = correction factor to account for finite waferthickness (see Section R2-3.2),Fsp = correction factor to account for slightlyunequal probe-tip spacings (see Section R2-3.3), andFT = correction factor to account for differencesbetween measurement and referencetemperature.NOTE 1: The correction factor F2 in SEMI MF84 is equal to F( S /D)/ln 2.R2-3 The relative variation in resistivity for smallvariations in these factors is given by the followingrelationship:14 TTspspCC FFFFDSFDSFSwFSwFwwIIVV dd)/()/(d)/()/(d dddd2323 ++++ +=°° (R2-4) The relative variations of the correction factorsF(w/ S ), F( S /D), and Fsp may be related to variationsin wafer diameter, wafer thickness, and probe-tipspacing as follows: 14 Bullis, W.

SEMI MF1528-1104 © SEMI 20041 SEMI MF1528-1104TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING BORON CONTAMINATION INHEAVILY DOPED n-TYPE SILICON SUBSTRATES BY SECONDARYION MASS SPECTROMETRYThis guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.orgSeptember 2004; to be published November 2004. Original edition published by ASTM International asASTM F 1528-94. Last previous edition SEMI MF1528-94 (Reapproved 1999).1 Purpose1.1 Frequently it is essential to control the boron levelin heavily-doped n-type substrates used to makeepitaxial wafers because the boron contamination canresult in autodoping at the epitaxial silicon-substrateinterface.1.2 SIMS can measure the boron contamination inheavily-doped n-type substrates.1.3 This test method can be used for process control,research and development, and materials acceptancepurposes. 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers the determination of totaltrace boron contamination in the bulk of single crystal,heavily doped n-type silicon substrates using secondaryion mass spectrometry (SIMS).2.2 This test method can be used for silicon in whichthe dopant concentrations are less than 0.2% (1  10 20atoms/cm3 ) for antimony, arsenic or phosphorusdoping. This test method is especially applicable forsilicon where boron is an unintentional p-typecontaminant at trace levels (&lt;5  10 14 atoms/cm3).2.3 This test method can be used for silicon in whichthe boron contamination is greater than two times theSIMS detection limits that is approximately between 5 10 12 atoms/cm3 and 5  10 13 atoms/cm3 dependingupon the instrumentation type.2.4 In principle, different sample surfaces can be used,but the precision estimate was taken from data onpolished etched surfaces.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Boron adsorbed on the surface can interfere withthe boron measurement.3.2 Boron adsorbed from the SIMS instrumentchamber to the surface can interfere with the boronmeasurement.3.3 The specimen surface must be flat in the specimenholder windows so that the inclination of the specimensurface with respect to the ion collection optics isconstant from specimen-to-specimen. Otherwise, theaccuracy and precision can be degraded.3.4 The accuracy and precision of the measurementdegrade significantly as the roughness of the specimensurface increases. This degradation can be avoided byusing polished etched surfaces.3.5 Variability of boron in the calibration standards canlimit the measurement precision.3.6 Bias in the assigned boron concentration of thecalibration standard can introduce bias into the SIMSmeasured boron. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specifications for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI MF1241  Terminology of Silicon Technology4.2 ASTM StandardE 122  Practice for Choice of Sample Size toEstimate a Measure of Quality of a Lot or Process1 NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 1 Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol 14.02, ASTM International,100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, PA 19428.

TheSIMS instrument should be adequately prepared (that is, baked) so as to provide the lowest possibleinstrumental background.7.2 Liquid Nitrogen or Liquid Helium CooledCryopanel, to surround the test specimen holder in theanalysis chamber if the analysis chamber vacuum is108 torr or higher. For instruments with vacuum lessthan 108 torr the cooling is not required.7.3 Test Specimen Holder, to keep the specimen(s)analysis surface planar and perpendicular to the severalkV extraction field, depending on the instrument type. 8 Sampling8.1 Since this procedure is destructive in nature, asampling procedure must be used to evaluate thecharacteristics of a group of silicon wafers.8.1.1 No general sampling procedure is included aspart of this test method, because the most suitablesampling plan varies considerably depending uponindividual conditions. See ASTM Practice E 122 forsuggested choices of sampling plans.8.1.2 For referee purposes, a sampling plan shall beagreed upon between the parties to the test beforeconducting the test. 9 Specimen Requirements9.1 Sample specimens must be flat and smooth on theside used for analysis. The surface shall have a polishetch surface or better (that is, chem-mechanicallypolished).9.2 Sample specimens must be cleaved or diced to fitwithin the sample specimen holder.9.3 A bulk boron-doped silicon calibration specimen isrequired.9.4 A BLANK silicon specimen with boronconcentration below 5  10 12 atoms/cm3 must bepresent. 10 Calibration10.1 The calibration standard must be present withbulk boron concentration between 1 and 10  10 14atoms/cm3 as determined by some other measurementthat is agreed upon by the parties.10.2 Each calibration standard specimen must be thesame size and have the same polished surface as the testspecimen.10.3 Each BLANK specimen must be the same sizeand have the same polished surface as the testspecimen.

The rate must begreater than 1  10 8 counts/s as measured on theFaraday cup or daley detector, and with no raster.11.2.3.2 Use a first raster test condition of severalhundred micrometers by several hundred micrometers,depending upon the beam radius, (typical condition is250-m by 250-m raster) to remove surface boron inthe native oxide. For the actual measurement, use asecond raster test condition reduced several times fromthe first raster condition (typical second raster conditionis 50-m by 50-m). Use integration times of 1 s.11.3 Analysis of Specimen11.3.1 Position the specimen holder such that thesputtered crater in the specimen forms near the centerof the window.11.3.2 Center the primary ion beam and begin a SIMSprofile.11.3.2.1 Sputter the sample using the first rastercondition for 50 to 100 cycles of the magnet until theboron intensity is stable to remove any residual surfacecontamination found typically in the native oxide of allwafers.11.3.2.2 Decrease the rastered area to the second rastercondition and continue sputtering until the boron signalis stable.11.3.3 At the end of the profile, measure and record the11 B+ count rate on the electron multiplier detector andthe 30 Si+ matrix intensity on the Faraday cup detector ordaley detector, averaged over the last 15 cycles.11.3.4 Repeat the above steps for all the specimens inthe holder until all the specimens have been sputtered. 11.3.5 Calculate the ratio ( 11B+ /Si+ ) of boron count rateto silicon intensity using the recorded secondary ionintensities at the end of each profile. Record eachcalculated ratio as Su.11.3.6 If the measured ratio ( 11B+ /Si+ ) for the BLANKspecimen exceeds 20 to 50% of the ratio (11 B+ /Si+ ) ofthe other specimens, abort the analysis and find thecause of the high instrumental background.11.3.7 For all specimens including the BLANK,calibration, and test specimens, record the specimenidentification, and the ( 11B+ /Si+ ) ratios, in a table. 12 Calculations12.1 Relative Sensitivity Factor (RSF) Calibration12.1.1 Calculate the relative sensitivity factor RSF asfollows: )/SiB(\[B\]RSF 11 ++= (1) where:\[B\] = assigned boron concentration in the calibrationstandard,11B+ = the 11B ion count on the electron multiplier, andSi+ = ion intensity on the Faraday cup, daley detectoror other detector capable of measuring positivesecondary ion currents above the rate of 108counts/s.12.1.2 Convert the SIMS ion count ( 11B+ /Si+ ) ratios,(S u), for each test specimen to boron concentration \[B\]uby multiplying the Su by the relative sensitivity factorderived from the calibration standard:RSFS\[B\] uu = (2) 13 Report13.1 Report the following information:13.1.1 The instrument used, the operator, the date ofthe measurements, and the boron relative sensitivityfactor,13.1.2 Identification of test and standard specimensand the location of the test specimen with respect to thecrystal, and13.1.3 The boron concentration values for the testspecimens and the BLANK silicon specimen. 14 Precision and Bias14.1 Precision  The precision was estimated for thismeasurement using over 900 samples, ten analysts, and

SEMI MF1529-1104 © SEMI 20041 SEMI MF1529-1104TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATIONBY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATIONPROCEDUREThis test method was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication bythe North American Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.orgSeptember 2004; to be published November 2004. Original edition published by ASTM International asASTM F 1529-94. Last previous edition SEMI MF1529-02. 1 Purpose1.1 The sheet resistance of epitaxial, implanted,diffused or deposited films is an important materialsacceptance and process control parameter. Theuniformity across a wafer of the sheet resistanceresulting from any of these processes is important forthe equivalence of performance of devices or circuitsmade from various regions of the wafer.1.2 This test method uses a four-point probe in amanner different from that of other ASTM methods forthe measurement of the resistivity or sheet resistance ofsemiconductors. In this test method, two different ways(configurations) of connecting the probe pins to theelectronics that supply current and measure voltage areused at each measurement location on the specimen.This use of a four-point probe is often referred to asdual-configuration or as configuration switchedmeasurements.1.3 There are three benefits that result from the secondmeasurement configuration at each location: (1) theprobe no longer needs to be in a high symmetryorientation on the specimen, that is, being perpendicularor parallel to the radius on a circular wafer or to thelength or width of a rectangular specimen, as long as itis a modest distance from the edge of the wafer, (2) thelateral dimension(s) of the specimen, and the exactlocation of the probe on the specimen no longer have tobe knownthe geometric scaling factor results directlyfrom the two sets of electrical measurements at eachlocation, (3) the two sets of measurements self-correctfor the actual separations between the probe pins in amanner that has been shown to be more effective thanmeasuring probe impressions made on a piece ofpolished material. As a result, high precisionmeasurements can be made with smaller probeseparations than is possible with single configurationuse of a four-point probe, thus allowing higher spatialresolution of wafer sheet resistance variations. 1 Perloff, D. S., Four-Probe Correction Factors for Use inMeasuring Large Diameter Doped Semiconductor Wafers, J.Electrochem. Soc. 123, 17451750 (1976). 1.4 This test method is intended primarily for assessingthe uniformity of layers formed by diffusion, epitaxy,ion implant and chemical vapor, or other depositionprocesses on a silicon substrate. The deposited film,which may be single crystal, polycrystalline oramorphous silicon, or a metal film, must be electricallyisolated from the substrate. This can be accomplishedif the layer is of opposite conductivity type from thesubstrate or is deposited over a dielectric layer such assilicon dioxide. This test method is capable ofmeasuring films as thin as 0.05 m, but particular careis required for establishing reliable measurements formost films in the range below 0.2 m. Films that havea thickness up to half the probe separation can bemeasured without the use of a thickness-relatedcorrection factor. It may give misleading results forfilms formed by silicon on insulator technologiesbecause of charge or charge trapping in the insulator.1.5 This test method can be used to measure the sheetresistance uniformity of bulk substrates. However, thethickness of the substrate must be known to be constantor must be measured at all positions where sheetresistance values are measured in order to calculaterelative variations in resistance reliably.NOTE 1: The thickness correction factor for layers that arethicker than 0.5 times the probe spacing is known to varymore rapidly than that for single-configuration four-probemeasurements, but such a correction has not yet beenpublished. Until such a correction is published, resistivityvalues determined by the dual-configuration method will notbe accurate for these thicker specimens; however, if the waferhas uniform thickness, variations of resistivity can still bedetermined by this test method. 1.6 This test method is suitable for use in materialsacceptance, equipment qualification, process control,research, and development. 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers the direct measurement ofthe sheet resistance and its variation for all but theperiphery (amounting to three probe separations) forcircular conducting layers pertinent to siliconsemiconductor technology. These layers may be

&lt;!-- Page 21 --&gt;

SEMI MF1529-1104 © SEMI 2004 2 fabricated on substrates of any diameter that is capableof being securely mounted on a prober stage.NOTE 2: The equation used to calculate the sheet resistancedata from measurements is not perfectly accurate out to theedge of the wafer for probes oriented at an arbitrary anglewith respect to a wafer radius. Further, automatic instrumentson which this test method will be performed may not haveperfect centering of the wafer on the measurement stage.These factors require that the periphery of the layer beingmeasured be excluded. Also, many thin film processes usewafer clamps that preclude forming layers out to the edge ofthe substrate. The edge exclusion in this test method appliesto the film that is being measured, rather than to the substrate.The equation used is based on mathematics developed forlayers of circular shape. It is expected to work well for layersof other shapes such as rectangular, if edge exclusionrequirements are met; however, the accuracy near the edge ofother shapes has not been demonstrated.2 2.2 This test method can be used to measure sheetresistance values from below 10 mΩ for metal films, toover 25 000 Ω for thin silicon films. However, forfilms at the upper end of this resistance range, and forfilms toward the low end of the thickness range, theinterpretation of the sheet resistance values may not bestraightforward due to various semiconductoreffects.3,4,5 NOTE 3: The principles of this test method are alsoapplicable to other semiconductor materials, but theappropriate conditions and the expected precision have notbeen established. 2.3 This test method uses two different electricalconfigurations of the four-point probe at eachmeasurement location. It does not require measurementof probe location on the wafer, or probe separations, orof wafer diameter (except to determine edge exclusionfor measurement-site selection) as do other four-pointprobe methods such as Test Methods SEMI MF81,SEMI MF84 and SEMI MF374. By use of electricaldata from the two different configurations at eachlocation, the method is self-calibrating with respect tothe geometrical parameters.1 2.4 This test method is intended to be used onautomated wafer testing systems that use R-theta or X- 2 Perloff, D.

The rapidcalculations for sheet resistance used in this test methodare based on more extensive calculations, and arewithin 0.1% of the results of those more extensivecalculations, even if the probes are not oriented parallelor perpendicular to a wafer radius, providing that theprobes are more than 3-probe spacings from the edge ofthe layer being measured 1,2 (see Note 1).2.5 Use of two electrical configurations at eachmeasurement site eliminates the need for measurementof geometric separation of the probe tips in order toanalyze the data. As a result, even for refereemeasurements, any probe spacing that is agreed uponbetween the parties to the test and demonstratessufficiently low data scatter may be used for this testmethod.2.6 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded asthe standard. The values given in parentheses are forinformation only.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Photoconductive and photovoltaic effects canseriously influence the measured sheet resistance,particularly with high resistivity layers or those withvery shallow junctions. Therefore, all measurementsshould be made in a darkened enclosure unlessexperience shows that the material of interest isinsensitive to ambient illumination.3.2 Spurious currents can be induced in the test circuitwhen the equipment is located near high-frequencygenerators. If such a location is unavoidable, adequateshielding must be provided.3.3 Minority carrier injection during the measurementcan occur due to the electric field in the specimen.With material possessing a long minority-carrierlifetime and moderate to high resistivity, such injectioncan result in a lowering of the resistivity (sheetresistance) for a distance of several centimeters fromthe point of injection. Carrier injection can be detectedby repeating the measurements at lower current. In theabsence of injection, no increase in resistivity should beobserved at the lower current. The current levelrecommended, (see Table 1) should reduce theprobability of difficulty from this interference to aminimum, but in cases of doubt the measurementsshould be repeated at a lower current level. If theproper current is being used, doubling or halving its

&lt;!-- Page 22 --&gt;

SEMI MF1529-1104 © SEMI 20043 value should result in a change of sheet resistance thatis less than 0.5%.Table 1 Nominal Current Values for Measurement ofSheet Resistance #1 The current used should be from one-half to twice the nominalvalue and should be chosen to give a measured voltage on thespecimen that is between 7 and 15 mV when using Configuration A.Once the current is selected for forward direction measurements at agiven site, it must be kept constant to 0.01% for the remainingmeasurements at that site. 3.4 Semiconductors have a significant temperaturecoefficient of resistivity. Consequently, themeasurement current used should be small to avoidresistive heating. The current levels recommendedshould reduce the chances of this problem. If resistiveheating is suspected, it can be detected by a change inreadings starting immediately after the current isapplied. If such a change is observed, repeat theelectrical measurements at a lower current. In theabsence of Joule heating, the temperature of the watershould be uniform if the wafer is mounted on a chuckhaving good thermal conductivity and large thermalmass. Sheet resistance maps should not be distorted bytemperature non-uniformities in this case. Coefficientsfor the temperature variation of the sheet resistance of aparticular layer type will depend upon the specificdopant, or resistivity, profile of that layer type, andmust be evaluated empirically for the layer fabricationprocess being used if correction of data to a fixedreference temperature is desired.3.5 Vibration of the probe may cause variations incontact resistance, which is often manifested asunstable readings. If difficulty is encountered, theapparatus should be vibration isolated.3.6 Penetration of either the current or voltage probesthrough the layer being measured to the substrateresults in erroneous readings. This can usually bechecked by mounting the specimen directly on a metalsupport that is grounded to the current supply and bythen looking for a reduction in measured specimenvoltage in at least one polarity as the ground connectionis removed and replaced. If this condition occurs,examine the probe tips microscopically for sharpasperities and remove these by polishing or otherwiseconditioning the probe tip, or else reduce the probeforce or use a probe with blunter probe tips. 3.7 Use of the data from the two electricalconfigurations to calculate a factor for water diameterand for position of the measurement site on the wafer isaccurate to within 0.1% as long as the measurement siteis away from the perimeter of the wafer. To meet thisrequirement the site should be at least five-probeseparations from the perimeter for the case of probealignment perpendicular to a wafer diameter, and atleast three-probe separations from the perimeter for thecase of probe alignment parallel to a wafer diameter.For certain processes, such as ion implantation, use of awafer clamp during layer formation causes a p-n layer-to-substrate junction on the top surface of the waferinterior to the mechanical edge of the wafer. In thesecases, the probe separation values above refer to thelocation of the measurement site with respect to suchjunctions.3.8 In shallow or lightly-doped layers, an effect knownas carrier redistribution causes the number of freecarriers in the layer to be different from the number ofdopant atoms. As a result, sheet resistance valuesmeasured by this test method may be noticeablydifferent from values calculated from models that implythe dopant and free-carrier depth profiles to beequivalent.3.9 Surface and near-surface effects, such as theformation of hydrogen complexes with acceptors, mayoccur during or immediately after the fabrication ofmany thin films, particularly if lightly doped. Theymay also occur slowly with storage. These effects maybe uniformly or non-uniformly distributed across thewafer surface. The result is to modify, generally byway of increasing, the measured sheet resistance. Twoof the most prominent impacts of these effects are tomake the results of a given process step appear to bemore non-uniform than is actually the case, and to shiftthe absolute level of a reference wafer used to monitorthe performance of the mapping tool so as to make thetool appear to be out of control. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI C19  Specification for AcetoneSEMI C23  Specifications for Buffered OxideEtchantsSEMI C41  Specifications and Guidelines for 2-PropanolSEMI M1  Specifications for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI MF42  Test Methods for Conductivity Type ofExtrinsic Semiconducting Materials Sheet Resistance,Ω Current#1 225 10 mA20250 1 mA2002,500 100 A2,00025,000 10 A

Theincluded angle of the tips shall be in the nominal range45 to 150°. The probe tips shall be in a straight linewith nominally equal separations in the range 250 m(0.010 in.) to 1.59 mm (0.0625 in.). An isolationresistance between adjacent probes, a factor of 105larger than the sheet resistance of the film is required; avalue of 10 9 Ω, or greater, is recommended for thewidest general application. Recommended tip radii andprobe force values are slightly different depending uponwhether the probe force is applied by springs, ordeadweight, as follows:7.2.1.1 Spring-loaded Probes  Having tips thatterminate in a radius in the nominal range 25 to 250 mor in a flat circular truncation of the cone with a circlediameter in the range 50 to 125 m. A probe force perpin of 0.25 to 2.0 N (approximately 25 to 200 gf) maybe needed to cover the variety of films that are coveredunder the scope of this test method.7.2.1.2 Deadweight-loaded Probes  Having probetips that terminate in a radius of at least 19 m. Aprobe force per pin of 0.1 to 1 N (approximately 10 to100 gf) may be needed to cover the variety of films thatare covered under the scope of this test method.NOTE 4: In general, the blunter the probe tip, the higher theprobe force that is used to make good electrical contact to thelayer. Conversely, the sharper the probe tip, or the thinner thelayer, the lighter the probe force that should be used. Theupper end of the allowed probe force range is generally usedonly for buried-peak conducting layers, such as MeVimplants, or for high-resistivity, thick epitaxial layers.General experience indicates that there is not a simplespecification of one or two combinations of probe radius andprobe force that will cover all layers of interest. Experiencewith conditioning probe tips against materials such as asapphire or non-polished ceramic substrate, or even on a pieceof lapped silicon, indicates that the microroughness of theprobe tip is a very important, but not-readily specifiable

A use test is given to aid inverifying appropriateness of a given probe for a specific layertype. Controlled lowering of the probe pins so that contact ismade without lateral scrubbing of the probes against the wafersurface has been found to be very important. 7.3 Microscope7.3.1 The microscope for inspecting probe damage shallhave a magnification of at least 600, and an eyepiecemagnification no greater than 15. The microscopeshall be capable of dark-field, interference contrast, oroblique illumination.7.3.2 The microscope shall have a stage capable ofmoving the specimen in order to examine a number ofadjacent damage marks made by each of the four probepoints.7.4 Measurement Stage7.4.1 Wafer Prober Stage  With a vacuum chuck orcomparable means of holding the wafer securely duringmeasurement. This vacuum chuck should be ofsufficient thermal mass to keep the wafer at a constanttemperature, within 1°C, during the time required forall measurements. The stage should be provided withstops, pins, engraved circles, or other means foraccurately and repeatedly positioning wafers. Formeasurements on wafers where the deposited orfabricated film may extend over the edges of thesubstrate and make contact to the backside, a thin layerof mica, or other electrical insulator must be usedbetween the wafer and the chuck.7.4.2 Probe Assembly Support that allows the probes tobe lowered onto the wafer surface with no evidence oflateral movement (probe skidding). This requirementcan be verified by lowering and raising the probes anumber of times onto a polished silicon surface withsteps of 50 to 100 m between these locations, and thenobserving the probe damage marks for each of theprobe points with the required microscope.NOTE 5: For a probe with blunt tips or well-conditionedprobe points, it is generally very difficult to view the probedamage with bright field illumination; use of dark-field,Nomarski, or oblique illumination is recommended. To aid inlocating the probe damage, the formation of a grid ofrectangles, by scribing, etching or other suitable process on apolished wafer surface, has been found helpful. Therectangles should be large enough to allow all four probepoints to be readily located within the boundaries and anumber of probe impressions to be made within the confinesof a single rectangle. 7.4.3 Wafer Probe Stage with a sufficient range ofmotion to allow probing all desired locations on thelargest wafers to be measured. Except for restrictionson the exclusion of three probe spacings at theperimeter of the layer being measured, the accuracy ofsheet resistance measurements using this test method donot require any particular accuracy on the positioncoordinates.NOTE 6: If this test method is used for refereemeasurements, uncertainty in position coordinates mayproduce accurate measurements at the locations measured butmay make comparison of data more difficult. It isrecommended that the wafer be centered on the stage with anaccuracy of 1 mm, or better, and that all positions measured,have coordinates controlled with an accuracy of 10 m, orbetter, with respect to the center of the stage. 7.4.4 The wafer stage shall be instrumented with atemperature monitor to be used for any applicationwhere the average sheet resistance of the layer is aparameter to be reported. The temperature monitormay be of any convenient type, but must be accurate to0.3°C, or better.7.5 Electrical Measuring Apparatus7.5.1 The conceptual layout of the electronic circuitry isshown in Figure 1 for the case where a standard resistoris used to monitor the applied current. The standardresistor can be omitted if the current value is set orknown directly.7.5.1.1 Constant DC-Current Source  Havingsufficient compliance voltage to supply a constantcurrent that results in a measured voltage drop on thespecimen that is between 5 and 20 mV. Currentsbetween 106 and 102 A are required if the sheetresistance range 1 to 20,000 Ω is to be covered. Theoutput current must be stable to 0.01%, or better, duringthe time required to take all data at each location; rippleand other noise must be less than 0.1% of the dc-currentlevel. A compliance voltage in excess of 10 V isgenerally not needed unless measurements must bemade through a significant layer of oxide or otherdielectric. A standard resistor (Section 7.5.1.2) isneeded to determine measurement current unless thecurrent supply is in calibration and known to output adc-current that is within 0.1% or better of the set-pointvalue. A wet or dry battery may be used for the currentsource providing there is means for regulating theoutput current.

However, for certainapplications of interest, such as metal films and very heavilydoped silicon substrates, it will generally be necessary toaccept measurements with fewer significant figures or else touse a current supply with an output above the commonmaximum of 100 mA, or else to use a voltmeter with sub-microvolt resolution. 7.5.1.2 Standard Resistor  Used to monitor the valueof the measurement current if the current supply doesnot meet the accuracy of settability given in Section7.5.1.1. The standard resistor shall be selected to give apotential difference of 0.5 to 5 times that measuredacross the specimen. This requires the standard resistorto have a value from 2.5 to 25 times the sheet resistanceof the layer. The value of the standard resistor must beknown at least to four significant digits.7.5.1.3 Switches  Double pole, double throw switchfor reversing the direction of the current, and four pole,double throw switch for changing the probeconfiguration. The switching functions may beaccomplished by wafer switches or relays. Isolationbetween all switch poles or relays must be 10 6 times thesheet resistance of the layer being measured; isolationof 10 9 Ω, or greater is recommended.7.5.1.4 Electronic Voltmeter  To read the potentialdifference across the specimen and standard resistor, orif calibrated in conjunction with the current source, toread the voltage-current ratio directly. The voltmetershall be capable of measuring dc voltages between 1and 100 mV full scale, and be able to resolve themeasured voltages to 0.01%, or better. The meter musthave an input impedance of at least 109 Ω. 7.5.2 Analog Test Circuit  Five resistors connected asshown in Figure 2 shall be used according to themeasurement electronics qualification procedure ofSection 11.3 for evaluating the accuracy and precisionof the electronics in the presence of large seriesresistors simulating the probe contact resistances.Several circuits of this type may be needed with theresistance of the central resistor, r, of each being,selected according to the expected sheet resistance ofthe layer to be measured, as listed in Table 2.

Itis beyond the scope of this test method to specifydetails of the computer-based automation.

Other grades may be used,provided it is first determined that the chemical is ofsufficiently high purity to permit its use withoutlessening the accuracy of the test.8.2 Purity of Water  Reference to water shall beunderstood to mean Type E-3 or better deionized (DI)water as described in ASTM Guide D 5127.8.3 Qualification Wafers8.3.1 Polished Silicon Wafers  Of any convenientdiameter for making probe impressions to be inspectedfor general probe related damage and contact size andshape. It is useful to divide the surface into rectangularregions by use of scribe lines or similar technique to aidin locating a particular series of impressions under theinspection microscope.8.3.2 One, or more, wafers from each of the processesto be evaluated, for testing the electrical suitability of agiven probe for the intended evaluation.8.4 Reagents for Surface Treatment  If surfacetreatment is required, the following chemicals may beneeded:8.4.1 Buffered HF  10:1 or more dilute, inaccordance with SEMI C23.8.4.2 2-Propanol  In accordance with SEMI C41.8.4.3 Acetone  In accordance with SEMI C19.8.4.4 Filtered dry nitrogen. 9 Sampling9.1 In the case of referee measurements, it is left to theparties to the test to agree upon the number of wafers from a batch, and their selection procedure, as well asthe number and location of test positions on each wafer.9.2 In the case of non-referee measurements, forexample, process control or research applications, it isleft to the user of this test method to determine thenumber and location of test positions on each wafer. 10 Suitability of Test Specimen10.1 The front and back surfaces of the wafer to bemeasured should be tested for conductivity type usingMethod A of SEMI MF42. If they are of the sameconductivity type, a thin sheet of insulating material,such as mica, should be placed between the wafer andthe stage. This test is not necessary if the front andback surfaces are known to be of opposite conductivitytype or if the layer is fully isolated from the substrateby a dielectric layer.10.2 If the wafer to be measured was fabricated by aprocess that uses finger clamps or other types ofclamping that intrude into the top surface area of thewater, the wafer is unsuitable for use with samplingplans that require measurements within several probespacings from the wafer perimeter. 11 Preparation of Apparatus11.1 Visual Inspection of Probe Impressions  Thisinspection should be performed when a new, rebuilt orreconditioned probe is first installed to get an initialindication of the mechanical performance of the probes.Once a probe is installed, meets the visual inspectioncriteria, and is left mounted, visual inspection of probeimpressions is generally not needed; functional probeperformance tests detailed in Section 11.2 generallysuffice to qualify the probe for continued use. Furthervisual inspection of probe impressions is advised,however, when a probe has trouble meeting therequirements of Section 11.2.1. More routineinspection of probe impressions is also advised ifprobes are interchanged routinely for specialapplications, thus increasing the risk of changes in thealignment or rigidity of the probe mounting.11.1.1 After selecting a probe for the intendedapplication, make a series of at least 10 probeimpressions on a polished silicon surface in steps of 50to 125 m (0.002 to 0.005 in.). Examine theimpressions from each of the pins to determine thatthere is no probe skidding, no cracks or fracture linessurrounding any of the impressions, and that theimpressions are generally compact in nature (see Figure3).11.1.2 If fracture lines are seen, the probe must bereplaced, or conditioned on surfaces of ceramic,sapphire, lapped silicon or other suitable, non- Sheet Resistance,Ω Analog and StandardResistor,Ω#1&lt;2.5 1225 1020250 1002002,500 1,0002,00025,000 10,000

After a conditioningprocess, it is useful to clean the probe tips withmethanol on a cotton swab to loosen debris that mayhave collected in the tip.11.1.3 If probe skidding is seen, tighten or otherwiseadjust the probe clamp and probe lowering mechanismto eliminate skidding.11.1.4 If non-compact probe impressions are seen,acceptable data may result, but the probe tip(s) aregenerally in an advanced state of wear and may not bestable with use.11.2 Probe Performance Verification  This test mustbe performed before any series of refereemeasurements, or if a type of layer is being measuredfor which there is not past experience regarding properselection of probe radius, load and conditioning. Itqualifies a probe for taking highly repeatablemeasurements, as are needed for mapping spatialvariations of sheet resistance, but does not ensureaccuracy of measured value. It should be performedseparately for each type of layer to be measured.11.2.1 Select a wafer of the type to be checked foruniformity. At five different locations that arereasonably well separated on the wafer, make a seriesof 10 measurements following the procedure ofSections 12.4 to 12.6, 13.1, and 13.2, using steps nolarger than 100 m between each of the 10measurement positions. Calculate the average andstandard deviation for each of the five sets ofmeasurements. For a probe to be satisfactory for use inmeasuring layers of this type, the standard deviationmust be no more than 0.1% of the average for at leastfour of these sets.11.3 Qualification of Measurement Electronics  Thesuitability and accuracy of the measurement electronicsshall be verified immediately prior to a refereemeasurement unless the equipment is separatelydemonstrated to be under statistical control formeasurements of that process. For non-refereeapplications, use of the analog circuits is helpful fortroubleshooting or performance monitoring of theelectronics.11.3.1 Analog Test Circuit11.3.1.1 With the current supply short-circuited orturned off, attach the current leads from the analog testcircuit of the appropriate resistance value to the currentsupply and connect the potential leads designated V (seeFigure 2) from the analog circuit to the input of thevoltage measuring instrumentation. Allow sufficienttime for the electronics to warm up in accordance withthe manufacturers instructions. a b c d#1 All probe impressions were made with steps of about 50m between impressions, and using probes loaded moreheavily than would normally be done for measuring thinfilms; this was done to provide better photographic detail.Figure 3Photographs of Three Indentations Each from (a) aSatisfactory Probe Tip, (b) a Badly Worn Probe Tip,(c) a Probe Tip Causing Conchoidal Fracture, (d) aProbe Tip Showing Skidding NOTE 8: Caution: Constant-current power supplies oftenoperate at output voltages of several hundred volts when notconnected to a load. Any changes of connection to aconstant-current supply should be made either with thecurrent supply turned off or with its output short-circuited. 11.3.2 With the current initially in either direction (tobe called forward) adjust its value to give a measuredvoltage of between 7 and 12 mV (see Table 1 fornominal values). Record the current, I f, through theanalog box, or measure the potential, Vsf , across theappropriate standard resistor connected in series withthe analog box. Measure the potential, Vaf , across theanalog box. Reverse the direction of the current andrecord the current, I r, or measure the potential Vsr,across the standard resistor; measure the potential, Var,across the analog box. Repeat this procedure until tensets of data have been taken. All values measured andrecorded must be known to at least four significantfigures.11.3.3 Calculations for the Analog Test Circuit11.3.3.1 Calculate the resistance of the analog boxresistor for both forward and reverse directions ofcurrent using the appropriate form of the equationsaccording to whether, or not, a standard resistor wasused as follows: ararsrsarrafafsfsaff IVVRVrIVVRVr ==== and (1)

Remove. Immediatelyimmerse in 2-propanol for 1 min. Remove. Blow drywith filtered dry nitrogen. Repeat if necessary untilspecimen is free from visible stains, streaking or othervisual evidence of residue.12.2 Mounting and Checking the Wafer12.2.1 Using vacuum paddle, tweezers, or roboticarrangement, mount the wafer on the stage, so that thewafer center is within 1 mm of the stage center. Clampthe wafer to the stage with vacuum or other means.Lower the probes onto the wafer. If not knownmeasure the electrical resistance between any of theprobe pins and the stage to verify that the electricalisolation is at least 10 9 Ω.12.2.2 Allow sufficient time for the wafer's temperatureto equilibrate with that of the stage. Thirty seconds issufficient if the wafer had been held at roomtemperature prior to mounting. Longer times arenecessary if the wafer was recently removed from areactor or other elevated temperature process.NOTE 10: The absolute value of the wafer temperatureduring measurement affects the absolute values of sheetresistance, particularly for lightly doped layers, but it shouldnot affect the measurement of uniformity of sheet resistancevalues, as long as the temperature is constant within 0.2°Cduring measurement of any wafer. However, for refereemeasurements or process control applications, for which theabsolute sheet resistance values are likely to be an importantpart of the measurement results, it is important to maintain thestage temperature within a narrow range (e.g., 23 ± 1°C) or todevelop an empirical relation between sheet resistance andmeasurement temperature for each layer fabrication processof interest. 12.3 Measurement Site Selection  Using themeasurement site selection agreed to for a refereemeasurement or that decided upon for process controlor other application, follow Sections 12.4 through 12.6at each measurement site before raising the probe andmoving to the next site.NOTE 11: Various site selection plans may be chosenaccording to the application needs. These include, but are notlimited to: diameter scans with step sizes appropriate to thespatial resolution needed, sparse sampling extensions of the 5-point and 9-point plans described in SEMI MF81, and areasampling plans with the size of the area and number of pointschosen by measurement time constraints and processinformation requirements, such as the circular or rectangularpatterns of SEMI MF1618. This test method makes norecommendation about choice of sampling plans, since userneeds and interests are widely varied.NOTE 12: If wafer diameter scans are chosen, the probeshould not be oriented so that the pins lie exactly along the

SEMI MF1529-1104 © SEMI 2004 10 diameter being scanned. Doing so would risk noisymeasurements if probes were placed in previous measurementlocations. This may be avoided by slightly misaligning theprobe pins with respect to the diameter. 12.4 Measuring in Configuration A to Obtain RA Connect the probe to the electronics so that the currentwill flow through the outer pins (designated Pins 1 and4), and that the specimen voltage will be measured bythe digital voltmeter (DVM) using the inner pins (Pins2 and 3), Figure 4. Lower the probe into the wafer.Start with the current in either direction (calledforward), and adjust the current to obtain a specimenvoltage between 7 and 12 mV, inclusive. It isrecommended that the current value be increased fromlow levels until the required voltage is obtained, ratherthan lowering the current from large values. Measurethe current (using the proper standard resistor, or bymonitoring the set point of a calibrated current supply),and the specimen voltage, each to a resolution of atleast 0.01% of the value. Record the current reading asI f (1-4) , and the voltage reading as Vf (2-3) . Reverse thedirection of the current and again measure the specimenvoltage and current to the same resolution. Record thecurrent readings as I r (1-4) and the voltage reading asVr (2-3) . The subscripts used for current and voltage arethose of the pins that perform the current-carrying andvoltage-measuring functions (see Caution, Note 8).12.5 Measuring in Configuration B to Obtain RB Without raising the probe from the measurement site,connect the probe to the current supply so the currentflows through one of the outer probes, and thenonadjacent inner probe, Figure 5. (There are two waysof doing this that should provide equivalent results.)Connect the remaining two probes to the voltmeter,making sure that the wiring polarity corresponds to thatused for the connections to the current supply. With thecurrent in the forward direction, measure and record thecurrent as If (1-3) and the voltage as Vf (2-4) ), with the sameresolution as in Section 12.4. Reverse the direction ofthe current; measure and record the current I r (1-3) andthe voltage as Vr (2-4) .NOTE 13: The notation in Section 12.5 assumes Pins 1 and 3were used for current, and Pins 2 and 4 were used forspecimen voltage measurement. If the other choice of wiringthe probe for Configuration B were used, the subscriptnotation in Section 12.5 (and Section 13.1.2) would bechanged accordingly.12.6 Moving to the Next Measurement Site12.6.1 Turn off, or short circuit, the output of thecurrent supply; raise the probe and move the stage tothe next measurement site. Follow the procedure ofSections 12.4 and 12.5 at this and all other sites.

SEMI MF1529-1104 © SEMI 200411 12.6.2 The current at each measurement site may bekept at the value used for the first site, or it may bereadjusted for each site to give a specimen voltageacross the specimen sites that is within very tight limits.Whenever the probes are lowered or the current ischanged, make sure that there is a short pause to ensurethat the probes, the current supply, and themeasurement voltage lines have stabilized before takingdata. Depending on the wafer type and the design ofthe instrumentation, this may be from a fraction of asecond to several seconds.12.6.3 Measure and record the temperature of the stageto the nearest 0.1°C at least at the beginning and theend of the measurements. Actual measurement oftemperature for each measurement site is preferred ifexperience indicates that noticeable drift or fluctuation(greater than 1°C) is likely to occur during the course ofthe measurements. 13 Calculations13.1 Calculate the Resistances from EachConfiguration for Each Site13.1.1 Calculate the average of the forward voltage-current ratio and the reverse voltage-current ratio forConfiguration A as follows to obtain RA:    +=)41()32()41()32(21rrffA IVIVR (5) 13.1.2 Calculate the average of the forward voltage-current ratio and the reverse voltage-current ratio forConfiguration B as follows to obtain RB (see Note 15):    +=)31()42()31()42(21rrffB IVIVR (6) 13.1.3 The forward and reverse voltage-current ratiosmust agree within 5% of the larger of these ratios bothfor RA and for RB in order to be acceptable for use inreferee measurements.13.2 Calculate Sheet Resistance at Each Site  Foreach measurement site, calculate the sheet resistance,Rs, as follows:Aas RKR = (7)where:2 2872.7173.25696.14 +=BABAa RRRRK (8) 13.3 Reviewing the Data  Many applications ofuniformity testing involve acquisition of large amountsof data. It is generally beneficial to review these databefore interpreting them simply as manifestations ofsheet resistance non-uniformity. A useful technique is to plot the values obtained for Rs as a time sequence,that is, in the order the data for the site were taken forthese sites. Examination of this plot may be correlatedwith measurement site coordinates to reveal unexpectededge proximity effects or regions of the wafer that haveunusual non-uniformity that may need to be re-probedwith a different site-selection plan. Examination mayalso reveal one or more points that are highlyinconsistent with adjacent points, possibly indicatingproblems due to vibrations or spots of surfacecontamination. Note such observations, but do notdelete or edit the data, unless agreed upon by all partiesto the test.13.4 Analysis and Summary of Data  The sheetresistance data may be analyzed and summarized in anumber of ways as agreed upon by parties to refereetest, or as appropriate for process control or otherapplications. These may include, but are not limited to:listing of all data with site coordinates, contour plots ofthe deviations from average value, and distributionalstatistics of the data. 14 Report14.1 The report shall include the following information:14.1.1 Operator's name, date and time ofmeasurements,14.1.2 Wafer identification number and description,14.1.3 Identification of instrument used, bymanufacturer, serial number, and model number,14.1.4 Identification of probe used, by manufacturer,serial number and probe spacing, probe tip radius andmaterial, and probe force specifications,14.1.5 Statement of site location plan used,14.1.6 Initial and final temperature at wafer stage forthe measurement sequence,14.1.7 Summary of sheet resistance data as chosen inconnection with Section 13.4,14.1.8 Notations about aberrant measurement sites asidentified by any data screening procedures employed,and14.1.9 Data from probe qualification tests. 15 Precision and Bias15.1 Precision  Single laboratory values forrepeatibility of the measurement of wafer uniformitywere obtained from a series of tests run in 1991. Forthese tests, five types of wafers with average sheetresistance values from about 15 Ω to about 400 Ω weretested, as detailed in Related Information 1.

SEMI MF1529-1104 © SEMI 2004 12 15.1.1 The wafers in these tests were fabricated by fivedifferent processes. The purpose of these tests is todemonstrate the consistency of determination of sheetresistance uniformity with dual-configuration four-probe measurements, not to determine the uniformityachievable by a given process. The five processesutilized are capable of both better and poorer uniformitythan seen here.15.1.2 The repeatability of uniformity values given hererepresent good measurement practice, but theconsistency of values for each wafer might have beeneven better if all measurements had been taken over ashorter time interval.15.1.3 A standard deviation, (in percent), was used torepresent the uniformity values obtained for each teston each of the wafers. While it is common to giverepeatability values as a standard deviation, in order toavoid confusion from duplication of terminology, therepeatability of the repeated determinations of non-uniformity for each type wafer are given in Table R1-1as the range of standard deviation values obtained in theoriginal tests. 15.1.4 A straightforward propagation of errors based onthe performance specifications, in order to estimate theprecision, does not appear possible. Requiredinstrument resolution, power supply stability, and probeperformance qualification are designed to allow arelative accuracy and precision of better than 0.1% forall measurement sites on a wafer. However, for waferswith high uniformity (for example, standard deviationof all measurement site values on the order of 0.2%),even these requirements may not ensure good two-party, or multilaboratory agreement on the waferuniformity.15.2 Bias  A statement of bias cannot be madebecause there are no semiconductor reference artifactswith a known level of non-uniformity. 16 Keywords16.1 epitaxy; four-point probe; ion implant;metallization; polysilicon; sheet resistance; silicon

SEMI MF1529-1104 © SEMI 200413 RELATED INFORMATION 1SINGLE LAB TEST RESULTS NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI MF1529. It was derived from informationdeveloped during the original preparation of the standard in ASTM Committee F-1 in 1994. This relatedinformation was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures on August 16, 2004. R1-1 One wafer from each of five different thin filmtypes was tested for uniformity. Each was 100 mmdiameter. A measurement test-site plan using 81 testlocations located at wafer center and on four equallyspaced circles with a maximum radius of 38.1 mm, asdescribed in SEMI MF1618, was used for allmeasurements. The measure of uniformity formeasurements on each wafer was the standard deviationof the 81 measured values expressed as a percent of themean measured value. For each of the wafers, 11 to 13tests of uniformity were run over periods that ran from3 to 6 months, depending on the individual wafer.R1-1.1 Temperatures of the wafer stage weremonitored and recorded. Average sheet resistanceswere found to change as a function of temperature butno corresponding corrections of sheet resistance valueswere made because the temperature coefficients ofresistivity were not known for the films involved. Theassumption was made that the determination ofuniformity should be minimally affected as long as thetemperature stayed relatively constant during the courseof each measurement run.R1-1.2 Results of this test are summarized in TableR1-1. The highest temperatures used for each waferwere achieved by deliberate elevation of roomtemperature in order to determine whether temperatureaffected average sheet resistance or uniformity value.Temperature dependence of average sheet resistancewas seen for wafer Types 1, 2 and 5. No dependence ofsheet resistance uniformity on temperature was seen. R1-2 An additional test involved three measurementsof uniformity on each of three different wafers from thesame five thin-film fabrication processes. These testswere completed within three days. They were alsoassociated with evaluation of the repeatabilitycapability of the sheet resistance measurementinstrumentation. For this evaluation of the instrument,50 measurements were made on each wafer by taking10 very closely spaced measurements in each of fiverelatively widely separated locations on the wafer. Theassumption was made that in each group of ten, themeasurements were so closely spaced compared to thesampling volume of the four-point probe that anyvariability experienced was a measure of the equipmentrepeatability (imprecision) and was not caused byvariations in the thin film itself. The actualmeasurements of wafer uniformity used the same 81-point test pattern as used for the wafers in Section R1-1.R1-2.1 The measurements from this test, summarizedin Table R1-2, show that for each process, the threewafers have a different average sheet resistance, evenwhen measured at the same nominal temperature andthey also have rather different levels of non-uniformityas determined from the standard deviations of the 81measurements. The variation of these run-to-runstandard deviations for a given wafer is seen to be smallcompared to the typical wafer-to-wafer standarddeviations for the different wafers from a given process.

SEMI MF1530-1104TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING FLATNESS, THICKNESS, ANDTOTAL THICKNESS VARIATION ON SILICON WAFERS BYAUTOMATED NON-CONTACT SCANNINGThis test method was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication bythe North American Regional Standards Committee on July 11, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.orgSeptember 2004; to be published November 2004. Original edition published by ASTM International asASTM F 1530-94. Last previous edition SEMI MF1530-0704.1 Purpose1.1 Flatness, thickness and thickness variation are vitalfactors affecting the yield of semiconductor deviceprocessing.1.2 Knowledge of these characteristics can help theproducer and consumer determine if the dimensionalcharacteristics of a specimen wafer satisfy givengeometrical requirements.1.3 This test method is suitable for measuring theflatness and thickness of wafers used in semiconductordevice processing in the as-sliced, lapped, etched,polished, epitaxial or other layer condition. 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers a noncontacting,nondestructive procedure to determine the thicknessand flatness of clean, dry, semiconductor wafers in sucha way that no physical reference is required.2.2 This test method is applicable to wafers 50 mm orlarger in diameter, and 100 m (0.004 in.)approximately and larger in thickness, independent ofthickness variation and surface finish, and of wafershape.2.3 This test method measures the flatness of the frontwafer surface as it would appear relative to a specifiedreference plane when the back surface of the water isideally flat, as when pulled down onto an ideally clean,flat chuck. It does not measure the free-form shape ofthe wafer.2.4 Because no chuck is used as a measurementreference, this test method is relatively insensitive tomicroscopic particles on the back surface of the wafer.2.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded asthe standard. The values given in parentheses are forinformation only.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Any relative motion between the probes and alongthe probe measuring axis during scanning produceserror in the lateral position equivalent-measurementdata.3.2 Most equipment systems capable of thismeasurement have a definite range of wafer thicknesscombined with sori/warp (dynamic range) that can beaccommodated without readjustment. If the samplemoves outside this dynamic range during eithercalibration or measurement, results may be in error. Anoverrange signal can be used to alert the operator andmeasurement data examiners to this event.3.3 The quantity of data points and their spacing mayaffect the measurement results (see Section 7.1.5.2).3.4 Site flatness measurements may be affected if thesite boundaries and corners do not contain data arrayelements. This effect may be reduced throughinterpolation techniques. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specifications for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI M20  Practice for Establishing a WaferCoordinate SystemSEMI MF1241  Terminology of Silicon Technology4.2 ASTM Standard 1 E 691  Practice for Conducting an InterlaboratoryStudy to Determine the Precision of a Test MethodNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 1 Available from ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, WestConshohocken, PA 19428, Tel: 610-832-9500, Fax: 610-832-9555,Website http://www.astm.org.

These wafers represented three differentmanufacturing processes. All three subsets were bareon the front surface. Two subsets were bare on theback surface and one subset had oxide on the backsurface.15.2 Eight laboratories measured thickness. Six ofthese laboratories also measured flatness. Each of thetwenty-three wafers was measured three times insuccession (in three cassette-to-cassette passes), on asingle day on automatic measurement systems, inaccordance with this test method.15.3 All measurement data were acquired with 3 mmnominal edge exclusion.15.4 Flatness values were calculated in an array of 15by 15 mm sites, and a 7.5 mm array offset in both x andy directions, relative to the wafer center. Within this137-site array, precision statistics were derived for fourselected sites, two full sites in the central area andtwo partial sites along the FQA boundary, asindicated in Table 2. Figure 2 shows these sites withinthe complete 137-site array.Table 2 Site Information Site ID Site Type Location on Wafer69 Full Center73 Full 60 mm from Center (0°)75 Partial FQA Boundary (0°)135 Partial Notch (270°) 15.5 The number of laboratories, samples, anddeterminations in this study met the minimumrequirements for determining precision prescribed inASTM Practice E 691.15.6 The ranges of 95% confidence interval, withinwhich two measurements are considered statistically tobe the same, for within-laboratory repeatability (r) andbetween-laboratory reproducibility (R) are shown inTable 3.

SEMI MF1535-1104 © SEMI 20041 SEMI MF1535-1104TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME INSILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OFPHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCEThis guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.orgSeptember 2004; to be published November 2004. Original edition published by ASTM International asASTM F 1535-94. Last previous edition SEMI MF1535-00.1 Purpose1.1 If the free carrier density of a semiconductor is nottoo high, the carrier recombination lifetime is controlledby impurity centers that have energies located in theforbidden energy gap. Many metallic impurities formsuch recombination centers in silicon. In most cases,very small densities of these impurities (10 10 to 10 13atoms/cm3 ) reduce the carrier recombination lifetimeand adversely affect device and circuit performance. Insome cases, such as very fast bipolar switching devicesand high power devices, the recombinationcharacteristics must be carefully controlled to obtain thedesired device performance.1.2 This test method covers a procedure for measuringcarrier recombination lifetime in a variety of types ofsilicon wafers. Because electrical contact is not madeto the wafer during the test, additional processing stepscan be carried out following the test if wafer cleannessis maintained.1.3 This test method is suitable for use in research anddevelopment, process control, and materials acceptanceapplications. However, because the precision of thistest method has not yet been established byinterlaboratory test, it should be used for materialsspecification and acceptance only after the parties to thetest have established reproducibility and correlation. 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers the measurement of carrierlifetime appropriate to carrier recombination processesin homogeneously doped, polished, n- or p-type siliconwafers with room-temperature resistivity greater thanabout 0.05 Ωcm. This test method may also be appliedto the measurement of carrier recombination lifetime inas-cut, lapped, or etched wafers provided that thesensitivity of the conductivity detection system isadequate.2.2 In this test method, the decay of the waferconductivity following generation of excess carrierswith a light pulse is determined by monitoring themicrowave reflectivity of the wafer. Since no contact ismade to the specimen, this test method is nondestructive. If wafer cleanness is maintained,wafers may be further processed following testing bythis test method.2.3 Depending on the level of photoexcitation, thecarrier recombination lifetime determined by this testmethod may be the minority-carrier lifetime (lowinjection level) or a mixture of minority- and majority-carrier lifetimes (intermediate and high injectionlevels). In the latter case, the minority and majoritycarrier lifetimes may be separated under someconditions if a single recombination center that followsthe Shockley-Read-Hall model is assumed (see RelatedInformation 1).2.4 This test method is appropriate for themeasurement of carrier recombination lifetimes in therange from 0.25 s to &gt;1 ms. The shortest measurablelifetime values are governed by the turn-offcharacteristics of the light source and by the samplingfrequency of the decay signal analyzer while the longestvalues are determined by the geometry of the testspecimen and the degree of passivation of the wafersurface. With suitable passivation procedures, such asthermal oxidation or immersion in a suitable solution,lifetimes as long as tens of milliseconds can bedetermined in polished wafers with thickness asspecified in SEMI M1.NOTE 1: Carrier recombination lifetime of large bulkspecimens can be determined by Method A or B of SEMIMF28. These test methods, which are also based onmeasurement of photoconductivity decay (PCD), requireelectrical contacts to the specimen. In addition, they assumelarge surface recombination on all surfaces and so the upperlimit of measurable lifetime is governed by the size of the testspecimen. Method B of SEMI MF28 stipulates that the testbe carried out under conditions of low injection to ensure thatthe minority-carrier lifetime is determined. Minority-carrierlifetime can also be deduced from the carrier diffusion lengthas measured by the surface photovoltage (SPV) method inaccordance with Method A or B of SEMI MF391. Whencarried out under low injection conditions, both the SPVmethod and the PCD method should yield the same values ofminority-carrier lifetime1 under certain conditions. First, it is 1 Saritas, M., and McKell, H. D., Comparison of Minority-CarrierDiffusion Length Measurements in Silicon by the Photoconductive

&lt;!-- Page 44 --&gt;

SEMI MF1535-1104 © SEMI 2004 2 required that carrier trapping not occur. Second, correctvalues of absorption coefficient and minority-carrier mobilitymust be used in analyzing the SPV measurements. Third,surface recombination effects must be eliminated (as in thepresent test method) or properly accounted for (as in SEMIMF28) in carrying out the PCD measurements. Thegeneration lifetime, which is another transient characteristicof semiconductor materials, is typically orders of magnitudelarger than the recombination lifetime. Although SEMIMF1388 covers the measurement of the generation lifetime insilicon wafers, the recombination lifetime can also be deducedfrom capacitance-time measurements made at temperaturesabove room temperature (≥70°C) using the same MOScapacitor structure.2 2.5 Interpretation of measurements to identify thecause or nature of impurity centers is beyond the scopeof this test method. However, some aspects of derivingthis information from carrier recombination lifetimemeasurements alone are discussed in the relatedinformation sections. Use of injection levelspectroscopy3 is discussed in Related Information 1and use of the temperature dependence of the carrierrecombination lifetime as determined with low-injection level4 is discussed in Related Information 2.The identity and density of impurity centers found to bepresent in the wafer by means of recombination lifetimemeasurements may usually be determined more reliablyfrom deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS)measurements made in accordance with SEMI MF978or from other capacitance or current transientspectroscopy techniques provided that a suitable catalogof impurity characteristics is available.5 2.6 Metallic impurities that affect the carrierrecombination lifetime may be introduced into thewafer during various processing steps, especially thosethat involve high temperatures. Analysis of proceduresfor detection of contamination sources (see Section 6.4)is beyond the scope of this test method.

NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Higher mode decay of photoinjected carriersinfluences the shape of the decay signal, particularly inits early phases.6 These effects are minimized bymeasuring the decay after the higher modes have diedaway (beginning below 50% of the maximum decaysignal).3.2 If the lifetime of the carriers is such that the carrierdiffusion length is greater than 0.1 times the waferthickness, the effects of recombination at the surfacesof the wafer must be suppressed by thermal oxidationor by immersion in a suitable electrolyte (see Section11).3.2.1 Treatments with electrolyte solutions must resultin a stable surface for the test method to producereliable results.3.2.2 A further caution is in order if thermal oxidationis employed. Particularly in high oxygen wafers, oxideprecipitates may form in the bulk of the wafer duringoxidation. The presence of such precipitates can alterthe recombination properties of the wafer (see alsoSection 3.4) thus rendering the test specimen unsuitablefor measurement by this test method.3.2.3 Externally gettered wafers may, under someconditions, yield erroneous values of carrierrecombination lifetime when measured by this testmethod. Results of measurements on such wafersshould be checked very thoroughly for validity.3.3 The method is not suitable for measurement ofrecombination lifetime in very thin films of silicon. Ifthe thickness of the test specimen is comparable with orsmaller than the inverse of the absorption coefficient ofthe incident radiation, the decay curve may be distortedby the spatial dependence of the generation of excesscarriers.3.4 Variations in carrier recombination properties inthe direction perpendicular to the wafer surface mayresult in inaccurate determinations of the bulkrecombination lifetime. These variations may arisebecause of the presence (1) of p-n or high-low (p-p+ orn-n+ ) junctions parallel with the surface or (2) ofregions of dissimilar recombination characteristics 6 Blakemore, J. S., Semiconductor Statistics, (Dover Publications,New York, 1987) Section 10.4.

Ifcomparisons between measurements are to be made(that is, before and after a process step or at a supplierand a customer), both measurements should be made atthe same temperature.3.6 Different impurity centers have differentrecombination characteristics. Therefore, if more thanone type of recombination center is present in thewafer, the decay may consist of contributions with twoor more time constants. The recombination lifetimededuced from such a decay curve may not berepresentative of any of the individual centers.3.7 The recombination characteristics of an impuritycenter depend on the dopant type and density of thewafer as well as the position of the energy level of theimpurity center in the forbidden energy gap (seeRelated Information 3). 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI C28  Specifications and Guidelines forHydrofluoric AcidSEMI C35  Specifications and Guideline for NitricAcidSEMI M1  Specifications for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI M20  Practice for Establishing a WaferCoordinate SystemSEMI MF28  Test Methods for Minority-CarrierLifetime in Bulk Germanium and Silicon byMeasurement of Photoconductive DecaySEMI MF42  Test Methods for Conductivity Type ofExtrinsic Semiconducting MaterialsSEMI MF84  Test Method for Measuring Resistivityof Silicon Wafers With an In-Line Four-Point ProbeSEMI MF391  Test Methods for Minority CarrierDiffusion Length in Extrinsic Semiconductors byMeasurement of Steady-State Surface PhotovoltageSEMI MF533  Test Method for Thickness andThickness Variation of Silicon SlicesSEMI MF673  Test Methods for MeasuringResistivity of Semiconductor Slices or Sheet Resistanceof Semiconductor Films with a Non-contact Eddy-Current Gage SEMI MF723  Practice for Conversion BetweenResistivity and Dopant Density for Boron-Doped,Phosphorus-Doped, and Arsenic-Doped SiliconSEMI MF978  Test Method for CharacterizingSemiconductor Deep Levels by Transient CapacitanceTechniquesSEMI MF1241  Terminology of Silicon TechnologySEMI MF1388  Test Methods for GenerationLifetime and Generation Velocity of Silicon Materialby Capacitance-Time Measurements of Metal-Oxide-Silicon (MOS) CapacitorsSEMI MF1530  Test Method for Flatness, Thickness,and Thickness Variation of Silicon Wafers byAutomated Noncontact Scanning4.2 ASTM StandardD 5127  Guide for Ultra Pure Water Used in theElectronics and Semiconductor Industry7 4.3 DIN StandardDIN 50 440 Part 1  Measurement of Carrier Lifetimein Silicon Single Crystals: Carrier RecombinationLifetime at Low Injection by Photoconductivity Decay8 NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 injection level  the ratio of the density ofexcess carriers generated by photons or other means tothe equilibrium density of majority carriers in anextrinsic semiconductor crystal or wafer.5.1.2 recombination lifetime  the average timeinterval between the generation and recombination ofhole-electron pairs in a homogeneous semiconductor.5.1.2.1 Discussion  In the Shockley-Read-Hallmodel, which applies for a small density ofrecombination centers, the recombination lifetime forcenters with energy levels that are not too close to aband edge is the minority-carrier capture time constantprovided that the density of excess carriers is very smallcompared with the density of majority carriers (lowinjection).

Thespecimen surface is conditioned in such a way thatsurface recombination has a negligible effect on thedecay of the conductivity following cessation of thelight pulse. This decay is monitored by means ofmicrowave reflectance, and the carrier recombinationlifetime is determined as the time constant of theappropriate portion of the exponential conductivitydecay.6.2 A narrow-beam light source may be used so thatmeasurements may be made repeatedly at differentlocalized points on the wafer to obtain a map of thedistribution of carrier recombination lifetime.6.3 The measurement may be repeated at severaldifferent values of specific parameters, such as injectionlevel (light source intensity) or temperature in order to obtain more detailed information about the nature of therecombination centers.6.4 A process step that acts as a contamination sourcecan sometimes be identified by comparingmeasurements of carrier recombination lifetime madebefore and after the step. 7 Apparatus7.1 Pulsed Light Source  A laser diode withwavelength between 0.9 and 1.1 m. Pulse length isnominally ≤200 ns, and the rise and fall times are ≤25ns (Note 2). It is preferred that the output power of thelight source be variable such that photon densitiesbetween 2.5  10 10 and 2.5  10 15photon/cm2 aregenerated at the wafer surface during the pulse.NOTE 2: The rise and fall times of the pulsed light sourceand the sampling time of the signal conditioner (see Section7.5) should be ≤0.1 of the shortest lifetime to be measured. 7.2 Photon Detector  Suitable means, such as asemitransparent mirror in the light path at an angle of45° and a silicon photodetector, to provide feedbackcontrol to maintain the laser power at a constant levelappropriate to the specified injection level.7.3 Microwave Pick-Up System  Including amicrowave source operating at a nominal frequency of10 ± 0.5 GHz and an apparatus for measuring reflectedpower, such as a circulator, an antenna, and a detector(see Figure 1). The sensitivity of the detection systemshall be as great as possible to permit measurement ofphotoconductivity decay at low injection levels.

Warning:Hydrofluoric acid solutions are particularly hazardous.HF solutions should not be used by anyone who is notfamiliar with the specific preventive measures and firstaid treatments given in the appropriate Material SafetyData Sheet. 10 Sampling10.1 If the test method is not used on a 100%inspection basis, sampling procedures shall be agreedupon by the parties to the test.10.2 If sampling by lot is required, the determinationof what constitutes a lot and the procedures forsampling and the procedures for sampling by lot shallbe agreed upon by the parties to the test.10.3 Because the concentration of recombinationcenters in a wafer may be non-uniform, it is desirable todetermine the recombination lifetime at various pointsacross the wafer surface. The point density andlocation of points measured shall be agreed upon by theparties to the test. 11 Test Specimen Preparation11.1 The required test specimen preparation dependson both the surface condition of the test specimen andthe expected magnitude of the bulk recombinationlifetime,b, to be measured.11.2 No test specimen preparation is required if thevalue ofb is no greater than one-tenth of the surfacerecombination lifetime,s. The surface recombinationlifetime is composed of two terms, a diffusion term,diff, which accounts for the diffusion of carriers to thesurface, and a surface recombination term,sr, whichaccounts for the recombination at the surface. Thesurface recombination lifetime may be computed fromthe following approximate relation:10 SLDLsrdiffs 222+=+= (1) where:D = minority carrier diffusion coefficient, in cm2/s,L = wafer thickness, in cm, and 10 Hornyi, T. S., Pavelka, T., and Ttt, P., In Situ Bulk LifetimeMeasurement on Silicon with Chemically Passivated Surface,Applied Surface Science, Vol 63, 1993, pp. 306311. S = surface recombination velocity, in cm/s, assumedequal on both surfaces.Electron and hole surface recombination lifetimes areshown in Figure 2 as a function of surfacerecombination for wafers with different thickness11(Note 4).NOTE 4: If S is very large (&gt;10 4 cm/s) excess carriersrecombine immediately on striking the surface so the surfacerecombination lifetime is dominated bydiff. A well polishedsurface has a surface recombination velocity of ~104 cm/s10while for an abraded (lapped) surface the surfacerecombination velocity is even larger (~107 cm/s, the carriersaturation velocity). In such cases, the maximum bulkrecombination lifetime that can be measured to 10% accuracyin wafers of standard thickness is about 1 s for p-type wafersand about 2 s for n-type wafers. In spite of this limitation ofaccurate determination of the bulk recombination lifetime, itis possible to detect relative variations of bulk recombinationlifetime on unpassivated polished wafers that have bulkrecombination lifetime as large as 0.5 to 1 ms provided thatthe following conditions are met:(1) the diffusion coefficient and surface recombinationvelocity are uniform over the wafer, and(2) the microwave system is sensitive enough to resolvemeasured lifetimes which differ by 1%.Under these same conditions, relative measurements can bemade on lapped wafers with bulk recombination lifetimes upto about 100 s. In this case, it may be necessary to etch thesurfaces in bright etching solution (see Section 8.5) for about1 min in order to obtain sufficient uniformity of the surfacerecombination velocity.11.3 If bulk recombination lifetimes larger than about0.1s are to be measured, the wafer surfaces must bepassivated by one of the following methods (Note 5) toobtain accurate measurements.11.3.1 Oxidation  Bulk recombination lifetimes upto about 1 ms can be measured on wafers ≥0.5 mmthick that have a very high quality (dry) thermal oxide(D it &lt; 10 10/cm2 eV) (Note 6). Ensure that the oxidationconditions are such that significant numbers of oxideprecipitates do not form during the oxidation cycle (seeSection 3.2.2). For measurement of lifetimes betweenabout 1 ms and 10 ms, strip the oxide in dilute HF (seeSection 8.6) and make the measurement within 15 min. 11 For these estimates, the diffusion coefficients were assumed to beconstant at the following limiting values: Dn = 33.5 cm2 /s andDp = 12.4 cm2 /s. These values are somewhat smaller than the limitingvalues given in the 1993 edition of DIN 50 440, Part 1.

SEMI MF1535-1104 © SEMI 20047 Note: The maximum bulk recombination lifetime that can be accurately measured is about 1/10 of the surface lifetime.Figure 2Surface Recombination Lifetime as a Function of Surface Recombination Velocity for Constant DiffusionCoefficient and Selected Values of Wafer Thickness11.3.2 Immersion in Passivating Solution  Tomeasure bulk recombination lifetimes up to ~1 ms on abare polished wafer ≥0.5 mm thick, first pretreat thewafer in iodine-ethanol passivating solution (seeSection 8.4) or an alternative passivating solution.Then enclose the wafer in a small plastic bag or otherfixture containing enough of the passivating solution tocoat the surface with a thin film while the measurementis being made. Ensure that the passivation techniqueresults in stable and repeatable measurements beforeproceeding with the test (see Section 3.2.1).11.3.2.1 If the wafer is oxidized, passivate it withiodine-ethanol, an alternative passivating solution, afterfirst removing the oxide by etching in dilute HFsolution for a time that depends on oxide thickness;etch times range from about 30 s for thin oxide (&lt;5 nm)to about 10 min for thick oxide (~200 nm).11.3.2.2 Again, ensure that the passivation techniqueresults in stable and repeatable measurements beforeproceeding with the test (see Section 3.2.1).NOTE 5: Polished surfaces that have been oxidized orpassivated with certain chemical solutions have much reducedsurface recombination velocity. For example, carefullyprepared thermally oxidized silicon surfaces have surfacerecombination velocity as low as 1.5 to 2.5 cm/s while thesurface recombination velocity can be as low as 0.25 cm/sfollowing stripping of the oxide in hydrofluoric acid.12 Thisreference also outlines a procedure for determining surfacerecombination velocity. Immersion in the iodine-ethanolpassivating solution (Section 8.4) has been shown to reducesurface recombination velocity of a chemically polished,oxide-free silicon wafer to ≤10 cm/s.10 12 Yablonovitch, E., Allara, D.

NOTE 6: The density of interface trapped charge (Dit) can bemeasured by a variety of techniques described in theliterature;13 however, none of these techniques has beenstandardized.12 ProcedureNOTE 7: The following procedures are given in sufficientdetail for manual data collection and analysis. However it isstrongly recommended that instrument setup, data collection,and analysis be carried out using computer-controlledequipment, with data storage and display capabilities. In suchcases, the procedures and algorithms employed must beequivalent to those given in this section. 12.1 If they are not known, determine the conductivitytype in accordance with SEMI MF42, the center-pointwafer thickness in accordance with SEMI MF533 orSEMI MF1530, and the center-point resistivity inaccordance with SEMI MF84 or SEMI MF673.Convert the resistivity to the density of the majoritycarriers (n maj, in carriers/cm3) in accordance with SEMIMF723. Record these data together with the nominaldiameter and the condition (polished, etched, lapped,as-cut, etc.) of the front and back surfaces.12.2 Record the temperature of the room, or if thestage is temperature-controlled, the temperature of thestage surface.12.3 Load the wafer onto the stage so that the lightpulse will strike the desired region.12.4 Switch on the pulsed laser light source (seeSection 7.1).12.5 Adjust the intensity so that the injection level,,is at the specified value. If an injection level has notbeen specified, set it to 100. If it is not adjusted 13 See, for example, Schroder, D.

Record the thickness.12.5.2 Determine and record the fraction of theincident light that penetrates the oxide and is absorbedby the specimen from the dashed curve in Figure 3. Note: For these calculations the wavelength of the incidentradiation,  , is assumed to be 905 nm, the index of refractionof silicon is taken as 3.610, and the index of refraction of SiO2is taken as 1.462. Maximum absorption occurs at an oxidethickness d = (2n + 1)/4 while minimum absorption occursat an oxide thickness d = n/2, when n = 0, 1, 2, etc.Therefore, if the wavelength of the incident radiation, 1,differs from 905 nm, these curves can be used by determiningthe relative intensity for an effective oxide thickness d 0 = 905d1/ 1 where d1 is the actual thickness of the oxide.Figure 3Fraction of Incident Radiation Reflected from (solidline) or Absorbed in (dashed line) a Silicon WaferCovered with a Silicon Dioxide (SiO2) Layerbetween 0 and 1 m Thick 12.5.3 Adjust the light source intensity so that thephoton density absorbed in the silicon during the pulse,, is equal ton maj, where is the desired injectionlevel and n maj is the density of majority carriers in thewafer as determined in Section 12.1.
