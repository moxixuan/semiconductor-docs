TEST METHOD FOR INDUCTANCE OF INTERNAL TRACES OF
SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES
NOTE: This entire document was revised in 1996.
1  Purpose
This test method describes the measurement method for
the   inductance   of   internal   traces   of   semiconductor
packages.
2  Scope
2. 1  This test method is applicable  for the measurement
of package inductance that is greater than 0.5 nH.
2. 2  This document describes the m easurement of a pin
grid array, one of the package types, as a sample.
2. 3   This  test  method  is  also  applic able  to  other  types
of packages.
2. 4  The inductance in this docume nt is limited to that
of internal traces only and does not contain the portions
contributed  by  the  exposed  areas  such  as  pins  and
wires.
2. 5  This document uses SI units.
3  Limitation
It is not practical to apply this test method for fine-pitch
packages  where  traces  or  pads  (point  A  of  Figure  1)
cannot be connected to with two probes.
4  Referenced Documents
None.
5  Terminology
5. 1  internal inductance (of packag es) — Inductance of
the circuit that comprises the signal path starts from the
shoulder or in the center of the outside lead (point A of
Figure  1)  and  ends  at  the  end  of  the  lead  on  the  cavity
side of the lead (point B of Figure 1). The return path is
made  by  tying  all  other  traces  (except  for  the  target
trace in the same electric potential) together. The target
trace is tied to the return path at the bonding finger (see
Figure 2).
Figure 1
Internal Inductance Measurement
Figure 2
Concept of Internal Inductance
5. 2   four-point  probe  —  The  probe   consists  of  four
coaxial   measuring   terminals,   H
c
(current   high),   H
p
(potential high), L
c
(current low) and L
p
(potential low),
to  measure  impedance.  Independent  coaxial  cables  are
used  between  the  package  being  measured  and  the
measurement  instrument  to  minimize  the  effect  caused
by   mutual   inductance   (between   terminals)   and/or
interferences  from  the  measured  signals  (see  Figures  3
and 6).
6  Summary of Method
Fabricate  the  package  to  be  measured.  Then  measure
the inductance of internal traces using the four terminal
probe method.
7  Interference
7. 1  It is desirable that an operator  who is familiar with
the    measuring    system,    measuring    method,    and</p><p>SEMI G23-0996 © SEMI 1980, 19962
principles,  conduct  the  actual  measurement  to  get  the
best result.
7. 2   To  get  an  accurate  measureme nt,  maintain  equal
probe angle and distance.

8. 1.3   Measurement  error  of  less  than   0.1  nH  for  the
measurement range more than 1 nH at the measurement
frequency
8. 2  Four Terminal Probe — See F igure 3.

10  Test Specimens
10. 1  Preparation of Sample — Con duct the circuit by
measuring the trace as a signal path and the rest, which
has  a  different  potential  from  this  signal  path,  will  be
the return path, as follows:
10. 1.1   All  the  bonding  fingers  shall  b e  soldered  or
pasted  together  at  the  bond  finger  area  to  form  a  short
circuit.
NOTE  1:  The  short  circuit  area  shall  be  0.5  mm  from  the  tip
of the bond fingers. The entire bond fingers shall not be short
circuited (see Figure 4).
Figure 4
Sample Preparation (Part of Bonding Finger)
10. 1.2  Short all pins or leads except f or the ones with
the same potential as the trace being measured.
NOTE 2: The location for the short circuit shall be as close as
possible to the bottom of the pins or the braze pad of the leads
to minimize the inductance caused by the pins or leads.
NOTE   3:   In   case   of   Pin   Grid   Array   packages,   it   is
recommended  to  press  50  μm  thickness  silver  foil,  which  is
the  same  size  of  package,  through  the  pins.  In  case  of  Flat
Packages, it is recommended to solder silver foil (or a copper
foil) at the braze pads of the leads.
11  Preparation of Apparatus
Before    starting    the    measurement,    warm    up    the
instruments as specified in the manual.
12  Calibration
Before    starting    the    measurement,    calibrate    the
instruments as specified in the manual.
13  Procedures
13. 1  Measurement of Residual Indu ctance
13. 1.1     Set    the    LCR    meter    to    the    induc tance
measurement mode.
13. 1.2  Measure the inductance by con ducting the four
terminal probe on the gold plated copper plate as shown
in Figure 5.
Figure 5
Measurement of Residual Inductance</p><p>SEMI G23-0996 © SEMI 1980, 19963
NOTE 4: The angle between the potential terminal probe and
the  current  terminal  probe  has  to  be  maintained  at  a  right
angle  (90°).  This  is  to  nullify  the  mutual  interference  caused
by the magnetic flux.
13. 2  Measurement of the Resultant  Inductance
13. 2.1   Place  the  sample  on  the  insula tor  such  as
Teflon.
13. 2.2   Set  the  probe  at  the  bottom  of   the  pin  of  the
trace being measured and at the closest traces belonging
to the short circuit as shown in Figure 6.

Probing Method
NOTE  5:  The  probes  H
p
and  H
c
are  attached/placed  onto  the
pins   to   be   measured   and   the   probes   L
p
and   L
c
are
attached/placed onto the short circuit.
14  Calculation
14. 1  The inductance of the internal  trace is calculated
as follows:
Internal  Inductance  (nH)  =  Measured  Inductance  —
Residual Inductance
14. 2  Round the second digit after th e decimal point to
the unit of 0.1 nH.
15  Report
The following information shall be reported:
• Brief description of the package
• Measurement instrument or system
• Measurement frequency
• Measurement pin numbers
• Inductance  —  Raw  data  as  well  as  the  average  in
case of multiple measurements.
16  Accuracy
Using   the   same   samples,   four   different   packaging
manufactures  were  tested.  The  following  results  were
obtained:
Repeatability — ± 0.2 nH
Reproductibility — ± 0.5 nH

TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING THE LEAD-TO-LEAD AND LOADING
CAPACITANCE OF PACKAGE LEADS
1</p><p>1 This test method applies to measurements in the range of 1 to 100 pico farands.
1  Purpose
This  document  defines  the  equipment,  materials,  and
procedures   used   to   measure   the   lead-to-lead   and
loading  capacitance  of  package  leads.  Semiconductor
packages   are   shown   as   examples;   however,   other
packaging elements can be measured by this method.
2  Equipment and Materials
2. 1   Capacitance  meter  which  uses   a  two  probe  plus
guard  method  with  two  coax  cables,  or  a  meter  which
utilizes a four probe plus guard method. The four probe
method  requires  four  cables  to  be  modified  to  connect
to  two  probes  at  the  probe  end  of  the  cables.  Both
methods require an 18 awg. or larger insulated wire for
the  guard  connection.  Keep  cables  at  minimum  length
(1  meter)  unless  specified  by  individual  equipment.
Coaxial  cables  must  be  used  to  connect  the  probes  to
the  meter.  Meter  accuracy  ±  2%.  The  probe  shields
must  be  connected  together.  This  connection  should  be
short, approximately one to two inches.
2. 2    Probe   station   with   two   coax   pr obes   and   one
regular   probe.   Recommendation:   Micromanipulator,
two  (2)  each  coax  probe  model  44-FPC-6000  with  #5
collet, and one each OON-FPC-6000 with #3 collet, or
equivalent.
3  Procedure: Lead-to-Lead  Capacitance(See
Figure 1)
3. 1   Set  the  instrument  to  measure   at  1  Mhz.  If  the
equipment  has  a  cable  length  selection  switch,  adjust
the switch to the appropriate coax cable length.
Figure 1
Lead-to-Lead Capacitance
3. 2  Connect together all the pins in  close proximity to
those  being  measured,  for  multi-layer  ceramic  package
pins  should  be  chosen  to  connect  all  traces  adjacent  to
traces  being  measured.  Example:  Eight  surrounding
pins  are  connected  for  the  68  lead  pin  grid;  twelve
surrounding pins are connected together for the 124 pin
grid;  eight  surrounding  pins  are  connected  together  for
all  flat  packs  (see  Figure  1).  If  there  are  power  planes
and/or large power buses in the package, their pins must
be connected together with the eight or 12 surrounding
pins discussed above.
3. 3   Place  the  guard  probe  down  on   the  cavity  side  of
any  one  of  the  eight  or  12  leads  discussed  in  Section
3. 2, to ensure that they will not affect the measurement.
3. 4   Place  one  coaxial  probe  appro ximately  1/8  inch
above   the   cavity   side   of   one   of   the   leads   to   be
measured.
3. 5   Place  the  other  coaxial  probe  a pproximately  1/8
inch  above  the  cavity  side  of  the  other  lead  to  be
measured.
3. 6   Nulling  Procedure  —  If  using   an  instrument  that
auto-zeros,    such    as    the    H.P.4275A,    follow    the
instrument instructions for capacitance measurement. If
this  type  of  instrument  is  not  being  used,  take  the
reading on the instrument at this point.</p><p>SEMI G24-89 © SEMI 1984, 19962
3. 7    Place   the   probes   down   on   the   l eads   to   be
measured. This should be a vertical movement only.
3. 8    Take   the   capacitance   reading.    If   using   auto-
zeroing  equipment,  this  capacitance  measurement  will
be used. If not, take the reading from 3.6 and subtract it
from   the   reading   in   3.8   to   derive   the   capacitance
measurement of interest. (See Table 1.)

TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING THE RESISTANCE OF PACKAGE
LEADS
1  Purpose
This  document  defines  the  equipment,  materials,  and
procedure  used  to  measure  the  resistance  of  leads  in
packaging  elements.  This  document  uses  a  pin  grid
(cavity  down)  package  as  one  example  of  the  type  of
packaging   element   that   can   be   measured   with   the
method  described  herein;  however,  this  measurement
technique  can  be  applied  to  other  geometrics  with
proper consideration.
2  Equipment and Materials
2. 1   D.C.  Ohmmeter  which  uses  th e  four  point  probe
(Kelvin)  method  with  four  cables.  Minimum  accuracy
should be ± 4 mΩ.
2. 2   Probe  station  with  four  probes .  Probes  should  be
such  that  the  taper  of  the  probe  and  the  diameter  of  its
point allow two probes to come together within a 5 mil.
square    without    touching    each    other    elsewhere.
Recommendation:  Micromanipulator,  four  each,  probe
number OON-FPC-6000 with #3 collet or equivalent.
3  Procedure
3. 1   Place  both  probes  of  the  low  s ide  of  the  meter  as
close  together  as  possible  on  the  shoulder  or  in  the
center of the outside lead (see Figure 1, Point A).
3. 2   Place  both  probes  of  the  high  s ide  of  the  meter
within 5 mils of the end of the lead on the cavity side of
the lead (see Figure 1, Point B).
3. 3   Set   the   ohmmeter   scale   to   the   lowest   setting
possible   without   putting   meter   in   an   “over   range”
mode.
Figure 1
Resistance Measurement
3. 4  Take resistance reading. Overall accuracy with this
method  is  ±  20  mΩ.    This  accuracy  estimate  includes
basic      instrumentation      error,      probe      placement
repeatability,  and  typical  package  construction  (printed
pattern accuracy).=
4  Application Note
Readings  below  100  mΩ  can  be  made  with  acceptable
reeatability if considerable care in pleacement is taken.
For   example,   in   measuring   a   conductor   made   of
tungsten 0.010&quot; wide, a 0.010&quot; variation in the distance
between  the  two  sets  of  probes  will  result  in  a  15  mΩ
change in the measured reading.  The same variation in
a gold conductor would result in a 3–5 mΩ error.

4  Method Summary
4. 1      Plastic   molding   compound   material   is   molded,
ground to a defined mesh size, and placed into a sealed
extraction  vessel  with  de-ionized  water.  Extraction  is
carried  out  at  120  ±  2°C  for  48  hours.  The  extract  is
analyzed for both anionic and cationic impurities.
5  Sample Preparation
5. 1      Samples  of  molding  compound  materials  may  be
obtained  from  either  standard  molding  operations,  or
prepared in the laboratory.
5. 1.1   Samples  from  molding  operations  may  include
mold  runners  post-cured  according  to  manufacturer’s
recommendations.
5. 1.2   To  secure  a  sample in  the  laboratory,  spread  a
thin  layer  of  uncured  compound  in  a  dedicated  clean</p><p>1 American Society for Testing and Materials, 100 Barr Harbor

teflon-coated    container.    Cure    and    post-cure    the
compound    material    according    to    manufacturer’s
recommendations.
5. 2    Crush  the  cured  material  using  a  suitable  grinding
apparatus,   such   as   Spex   mixer-mill   No.   8000,   or
equivalent.
NOTE 1: The grinder used must not generate excess localized
heat, or else sample decomposition and erroneous results may
be generated.
NOTE  2:  Addition  of  liquid  nitrogen is a suitable method for
eliminating    undesirable    thermal    decomposition    during
grinding.
5. 3  Remove the ground compound and sieve it. Collect
for analysis the portion which passes through a 40 mesh
size,  but  is  retained  on  a  100  mesh  size  screen.  This
particle  size  is  best  suited  for  adequate  extraction  of
impurities.
5. 4    Weigh  10  ±  0.1  grams  of  the  powdered  material
and  place  in  an  extraction  vessel.  Parr  bombs  with
teflon liners are suitable extraction vessels. Add 100 ml
de-ionized  water.  Prepare  blank  extraction  vessel  by
processing  it  in  the  same  manner  as  your  sample.
Weigh the sealed bombs and record their weights. Place
the sealed bottles on their sides in an oven at 120 ± 2°C
for forty-eight (48) hours.
NOTE 3: Certain compounds may require addition of reagent
grade methanol 10% (V:V) to enhance wetting.
5. 5    At  the  completion  of  forty-eight  (48)  hours  of
extraction,    allow    the    bombs    to    cool    to    room
temperature and reweigh. If the weight loss exceeds 0.5
grams  the  sample  should  not  be  used  for  analysis.
Portion of this extract may be used to generate pH and
conductivity  data.  Anion  analysis  may  be  performed
using  ion  chromatography  or  specific  ion  electrodes.
Cation   analysis   may   be   conducted   using   atomic
absorption,        plasma        spectrometry,        or        ion
chromatography.
NOTE    4:    It    is    important    to    avoid    contamination    with
particulate  matter  in  the  extract  used  for  the  analysis  by  AA,
ICAP,   or   IC.   This   procedure   addresses   determination   of
extractive species only.</p><p>SEMI G29-1296

Individual  standards  are  needed  for  each  ion  tested.
Methodology  recommended  by  the  manufacturer  for
each  ion  specific  electrode  should  be  closely  followed.
Measured   concentrations   corrected   for   blank   value
should  be  compared  to  the  known  standards  in  the
range  0.1–100  ppm.  Chloride  and  bromide  are  usually
determined,   using   a   solid   state   single   electrode.

Chromatography</li><li>5.1  Method  Principle  —  Ion  chromatography  is  a
form  of  liquid  chromatography  used  in  the  separation
and quantitation of ions. A filtered aliquot of sample is
injected  into  an  Ion  chromatograph.  The  sample  is
pumped  by  the  eluent  stream  through  two  (2)  different
ion exchange columns: a guard column, which serves to
protect  the  separator  column  from  residual  particulate
matter  and  retain  certain  organics,  and  the  separator
column,  the  primary  function  of  which  is  to  separate
analyzed  ions  based  on  their  affinity  for  the  exchange
sites of the resin. Both guard column and the separator
column  are  packed  with  identical  low  capacity  anion
exchanger  (anion  analysis)  or  cation  exchange  (cation
analysis).  The  separated  ionic  species  then  pass  to  a
detector  module  consisting  of  a  chemical  suppressor
device and a conductivity cell. The suppressor device is
used to reduce background conductivity of the eluent to
a  low,  or  negligible  level,  and  convert  analyte  anions
into   their   acid   form   or   analyte   cations   into   their
hydroxide  form.  Thus,  separated  and  modified  ionic
species  are  detected  using  an  electrical  conductivity
cell. Anions are identified based on their retention time
compared   to   the   known   standards.   Quantitation   is
accomplished by measuring the peak height or area, and
comparing  it  to  a  calibration  curve  generated  from
known standards.

Plasma  (ICP)  uses  high  frequency  Argon  Plasma  to
excite   sample   constituents   to   8000°K.   Because   the
plasma   ionizes   most   atomic   species,   background
interferences  are  vastly  reduced  and  linear  response
over  several  orders  of  magnitude  can  be  observed  for
most elements. The sample extract is aspirated into the
plasma by means of a high purity argon carrier gas. The
resulting  emissions  are  directed  into  the  spectrometer
and  signal  strengths  are  read  by  photomultiplier  tubes
placed  at  emission  points  in  a  focal  curve.  A  computer
is  used  to  scan  each  elemental  channel  many  times  a
second, and this output is sent to a printer in numerical
form.  The  cycle  or  time  of  analysis  is  usually  about
seven  (7)  seconds.  With  this  instrument,  very  little  of
the extracted sample is consumed.</li></ol><p>SEMI G26-1296

TEST METHOD FOR JUNCTION-TO-CASE THERMAL RESISTANCE
MEASUREMENTS OF CERAMIC PACKAGES
1  Purpose
The  purpose  of  this  test  is  to  determine  the  thermal
resistance of ceramic packages using thermal test chips.
This  test  method  deals  only  with  junction-to-case  or
mounting  surface  measurements  of  thermal  resistance
and  limits  itself  to  heat  sink  and  fluid  bath  testing
environments. Following the guidelines outlined in this
test    method,    junction-to-case    thermal    resistance
measurements  of  ceramic  packages  using  the  heat  sink
and  fluid  bath  methods  should  give  the  same  results
only   under   certain   limited   conditions   (i.e.,   under
conditions  that  approximate  unidirectional  heat  flow
through  the  chip  and  substrate  to  the  preferred  heat
removal  surface).  If  discrepancies  occur,  the  heat  sink
mounting  technique  shall  be  considered  as  the  referee
test   method.   The   heat   sink   mounting   method   for
measuring  junction-to-case  thermal  resistance  will  be  a
conservative   measure   of   the   package’s   ability   to
transfer  heat  to  the  ambient  environment  because  heat
sinking  is  provided  only  on  one  side  of  the  package,
whereas   the   fluid   bath   mounting   method   has   the
potential for equally cooling both sides of the package.</p><ol><li>1    Definitions   —   The   following   d efinitions   and
symbols shall apply for the purpose of this test:
a.case  temperature,  T
C
,  in  degrees  Celsius.  The  case
temperature   is   the   temperature   at   a   specified
accessible  reference  point  on  the  package  in  which
the microelectronic chip is mounted.
b.mounting   surface   temperature,   T
M
,   in   degrees
Celsius.  The  mounting  surface  temperature  is  the
temperature  of  a  specified  point  at  the  device-heat
sink  mounting  interface  (or  primary  heat  removal
surface).
c.junction  temperature,  T
J
,  in  degrees  Celsius.  The
term   is   used   to   denote   the   temperature   of   the
semiconductor junction in the microcircuit in which
the major part of the heat is generated. For purposes
of  this  test,  the  measured  junction  temperature  is
only  indicative  of  the  temperature  in  the  immediate
vicinity    of    the    element    used    to    sense    the
temperature.
d.power dissipation, P
H
, in watts, is the heating power
applied to the device causing a junction-to-reference
point temperature difference.
e.thermal  resistance,  junction-to-specified  reference
point, R
ΘJR
,  in  degrees  Celsius/watt.  The  thermal
resistance  of  the  microcircuit  is  the  temperature
difference from the junction to some reference point
on the package divided by the power dissipation P
H
.
f.temperature-sensitive    parameter,    TSP,    is    the
temperature-dependent   electrical   characteristic   of
the junction under test which can be calibrated with
respect  to  temperature  and  subsequently  used  to
detect the junction temperature of interest.
2  Apparatus</li><li>1  The apparatus required for the se tests shall include
the   following   as   applicable   to   the   specified   test
procedures.
a.   Thermocouple  material  shall  be  copper-constantan
(type  T)  or  equivalent,  for  the  temperature  range
-100  to  +300°C.  The  wire  size  shall  be  no  larger
than    AWG    size    30.    The    junction    of    the
thermocouple shall be welded to form a bead rather
than   soldered   or   twisted.   The   accuracy   of   the
thermocouple   and   associated   measuring   system
shall be ± 0.5°C.
b.   Suitable electrical equipment as required to provide
controlled levels of conditioning power and to make
the specified measurements. The instrument used to
electrically     measure     the     temperature-sensitive
parameter  shall  be  capable  of  resolving  a  voltage
change of 0.5 mV.
c.   Controlled  temperature  chamber,  fluid  bath,  or  heat
sink  capable  of  maintaining  the  specified  reference
point  temperature  to  within  ±  0.5°C  of  the  preset
(measured)   value.   Typical   temperature-controlled
heat sink and fluid bath assemblies are presented for
illustrative purposes only.</li><li>2    Heat   Sink   Assembly   —   A   typic al   heat   sink
assembly   for   mounting   the   microelectronic   device
under  test  is  shown  in  Figure  1.  The  primary  heat  sink
is  water  cooled  using  a  temperature-controlled  fluid
circulator  bath.  An  adapter  socket/heat  sink  is  fastened
to  the  heat  removal  surface  of  the  primary  heat  sink,
and  has  a  special  geometry  to  handle  specific  size
packages  (e.g.,  flat  packs,  dual-in-line  packages,  chip
carriers).   This   adapter   provides   a   repeatable   and</li></ol><p>SEMI G30-88 © SEMI 1986, 19882
efficient interface between the package and the primary
heat   sink.   The   mounting   surface   temperature   is
determined with a thermocouple attached from the side
or  bottom  of  the  adapter  with  a  thermal  conducting
adhesive  or  grease  at  or  near  the  interface  between  the
adapter  and  the  package.  It  is  at  this  point  that  the
device-under-test     temperature     is     specified     and
controlled. The adapter also contains the socket or other
electrical interconnection scheme. A thin coating (about
25 – 50 mm thick) of a thermal heat-sinking compound,
such  as  zinc-oxide-loaded  silicone  thermal  grease,  is
used  at  the  interface  to  provide  a  reliable  thermal
contact.
2. 3  Fluid  Bath  Assembly  —  A  typ ical  temperature-
controlled  fluid  bath  for  thermally  characterizing  the
microelectronic device under test is shown in Figure 2.
In  this  figure,  the  package  is  mounted  in  a  fluid  bath
separate  from  the  fluid  circulator,  although  it  can  be
immersed  directly  in  an  integrated  fluid  circulator/bath
unit.  The  fluid  in  the  bath  should  be  continuously
stirred  or  agitated  to  ensure  the  required  temperature
stability.  Since  this  working  fluid  is  being  used  as  an
infinite     heat     sink,     the     case-to-fluid     (ambient)
temperature difference at the case temperature reference
point  of  interest  should  be  minimized,  i.e.,  less  than  or
equal to 20°C. For case-to-fluid temperature differences
greater     than     20°C,     accuracy     and     repeatability
difficulties    may    occur    due    to    a    large    variable
temperature gradient in the fluid film boundary layer at
the     package-fluid     interface.     The     case-to-fluid
temperature difference can be minimized by increasing
the  fluid  velocity  and  by  decreasing  the  power  density
seen  by  the  fluid.  The  device  under  test  should  be
mounted  such  that  heat  transfer  to  the  fluid  is  not
impeded.   For   leaded   devices,   the   leads   should   be
oriented in such a manner so as not to interfere with the
heat  transfer  to  the  fluid  and  provide  freedom  to  any
thermal currents caused by the power dissipation within
the  package.  The  case  temperature  of  the  device  under
test  should  be  measured  with  a  thermocouple  that  is
attached  to  the  package  and  should  not  be  assumed  to
be  at  the  fluid  temperature.  Care  should  be  taken  to
minimize  exposure  of  the  thermocouple  bead  to  the
high  temperature  gradient  in  the  fluid  film  boundary
layer  at  the  package-fluid  interface.  The  working  fluid
should  have  a  thermal  conductivity  at  25°C  of  at  least
0. 0006    W/cm°C.    Working    fluids    such    as    inert
fluorocarbon  liquids  and  silicone  oils  are  suitable  as  a
cooling media.
3  Procedure
3. 1      Direct     Measurement     of     Refere nce     Point
Temperature  —  T
C
.  For  the  purpose  of  measuring  a
microelectronic device thermal resistance, the reference
point  temperature  shall  be  measured  at  the  package
location  of  highest  temperature  which  is  accessible
outside  the  package.  This  reference  point  location  is
determined  with  the  device  operating  in  free  air  and
with no external heat-sinking. In general, this reference
point  is  found  to  be  on  the  outside  surface  of  the
package  substrate  directly  underneath  the  chip  in  the
major path of heat flow from the chip to the heat sink or
ambient.  Examples  of  the  reference  point  location  for
both  cavity-up  and  cavity-down  ceramic  packages  are
depicted  in  Figure  3.  The  package  surface  may  be
altered  to  facilitate  this  measurement,  provided  that
such alteration does not affect the original heat transfer
paths  and,  hence,  the  thermal  resistance,  within  the
package by more than a few percent. For packages with
an   integral   heat   dissipater   attached   to   the   outside
surface  of  the  package  substrate,  the  case  temperature
reference  point  shall  be  on  the  surface  of  the  heat
dissipater at a point opposite the backside of the chip as
indicated in Figure 4.
3. 1.1    Case   temperature,   T
C
.   The   mic roelectronic
device  under  test  shall  be  mounted  under  specified
conditions  so  that  the  case  temperature  can  be  held  at
the  specified  value.  A  thermocouple  shall  be  attached
on the surface of the device package directly under the
chip. A conducting epoxy may be used for this purpose.
The  thermocouple  bead  should  be  in  direct  mechanical
contact  with  the  case  of  the  microelectronic  device
under   test.   For   devices   which,   in   their   normal
application,   are   intimately   connected   (by   pressure
contact,  adhesive,  soldering,  or  other  means)  to  an
external heat sink, the mounting surface temperature, as
measured   directly   below   the   primary   heat   removal
surface of the case, may be used as the equivalent case
temperature.
If it is found that attaching the thermocouple directly to
the case is impractical, an alternate approach utilizing a
thermocouple  welded  to  one  side  of  a  thin  metal  disk
should  be  used.  This  can  be  accomplished  by  parallel
gap welding the crossed thermocouple wires to one side
of  a  0.25  cm  (0.094  in)  diameter,  0.02  cm  (0.008  in)
thick  beryllium-copper  disk  and  then,  with  a  thin  layer
of  adhesive,  bonding  the  other  side  of  the  disk  to  the
case at the point of interest.
3. 1.1.1     Mounting    surface    temperature ,    T
M
.    The
mounting   surface   temperature   is   measured   directly
below the primary heat removal surface of the case. It is
measured  with  a  thermocouple  at  or  near  the  mounting
surface    of    the    heat    sink.    A    typical    mounting
arrangement  is  shown  in  Figure  5.  The  surface  of  the
copper mounting base shall be nickel plated and free of
oxides.
The   thermocouple   hole   shall   be   drilled   into   the
mounting   base   such   that   the   thermocouple   lead   is
directly  below  the  area  on  the  case  of  interest.  It  is</p><p>SEMI G30-88 © SEMI 1986, 19883
recommended that the thermocouple be secured into the
mounting  base  with  a  thermal  conducting  adhesive  (or
solder)   and   that   particular   attention   be   paid   to
minimizing    air    voids    around    the    ball    or    the
thermocouple.   A   thermal   conducting   compound   (or
adhesive)   should   be   used   at   the   interfaces   of   the
mounting base and the device under test. The mounting
surface technique is application oriented in that it takes
into account the mounting surface interface.
3. 2  Thermal      Resistance,      Junction-t o-Specified
Reference point, R
ΘJR
3. 2.1     General    Considerations    —    Th e    thermal
resistance of a semiconductor device is a measure of the
ability of its carrier or package and mounting technique
to  provide  for  heat  removal  from  the  semiconductor
junction.  The  thermal  resistance  of  a  microelectronic
device   can   be   calculated   when   the   case/mounting
surface temperature and power dissipation in the device
and  a  measurement  of  the  junction  temperature  are
known.
When making the indicated measurements, the package
shall    be    considered    to    have    achieved    thermal
equilibrium   when   halving   the   time   between   the
application  of  power  and  the  taking  of  the  reading
causes  no  error  in  the  indicated  results  within  the
required accuracy of measurement.
3. 2.2   Indirect  Measurement  of  Junct ion  Temperature
for the Determination of R
ΘJR
— The purpose of the test
is   to   measure   the   thermal   resistance   of   integrated
circuits  by  using  particular  semiconductor  elements  on
the  chip  to  indicate  the  device  junction  temperature.  In
order  to  obtain  a  realistic  estimate  of  the  operating
junction  temperature,  the  whole  chip  in  the  package
should  be  powered  in  order  to  provide  the  proper
internal  temperature  distribution.  During  measurement
of  the  junction  temperature  the  chip  heating  power
(constant  voltage  source)  shall  remain  constant  while
the  junction  calibration  current  remains  stable.  It  is
assumed that the calibration current will not be affected
by   the   circuit   operation   during   the   application   of
heating power.
The  temperature-sensitive  device  parameter  is  used  as
an    indicator    of    an    average    (weighted)    junction
temperature    of    the    semiconductor    element    for
calculations   of   thermal   resistance.   The   measured
junction  temperature  is  indicative  of  the  temperature
only  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  element  used  to
sense the temperature.
The      temperature-sensitive      electrical      parameters
generally   used   to   indirectly   measure   the   junction
temperature  are  the  forward  voltage  of  diodes  and  the
emitter-base   voltage   of   bipolar   transistors.   Other
appropriate  temperature-sensitive  parameters  may  be
used  for  indirectly  measuring  junction  temperature  for
fabrication  technologies  that  do  not  lend  themselves  to
sensing the active junction voltages.
3. 2.2.1   Steady-state  technique  for  mea suring  T
J
.  The
following  symbols  shall  apply  for  the  purpose  of  these
measurements:
I
M
Measuring current in milliamperes.
V
MH-
Value    of    temperature-sensitive    parameter    in
millivolts, measured at I
M
, and corresponding to the
temperature of the junction heated by P
H
.
T
MC-
Calibration    temperature    in    degrees    Celsius,
measured at the reference point.
V
MC-
Value    of    temperature-sensitive    parameter    in
millivolts,  measured  at  I
M
,  and  specific  value  of
T
MC
.
The measurement of T
J
using  junction  forward  voltage
as the TSP is made in the following manner:
Step  1  —  Measurement  of  the  temperature  coefficient
of the TSP (calibration).
The  coefficient  of  the  temperature-sensitive  parameter
is  generated  by  measuring  the  TSP  as  a  function  of  the
reference  point  temperature,  for  a  specified  constant
measuring current, IM, by externally heating the device
under  test  in  an  oven  or  in  a  fluid  bath.  The  reference-
point  temperature  range  used  during  calibration  shall
encompass  the  temperature  range  encountered  in  the
power  application  test  (see  Step  2).  The  measuring
current is generally chosen such that the TSP decreases
linearly  with  increasing  temperature  over  the  range  of
interest,  and  that  negligible  internal  heating  occurs  in
the   silicon   and   metal   traces.   For   determining   the
optimum TSP calibration or measuring current, V
MC
vs.
log I
M
curves for two temperature levels that encompass
the  calibration  temperature  range  of  interest  should  be
plotted.  The  optimum  measuring  current,  I
M
,  is  then
selected such that it resides on the linear portion of the
two  V
MC
vs.  log  I
M
curves  that  were  generated.  A
measuring   current   ranging   from   0.05   to   5   mA   is
generally  used,  depending  on  the  specifications  and
operating   conditions   of   the   device   under   test,   for
measuring  the  TSP.  The  value  of  the  TSP  temperature
coefficient,  V
MC
/T
MC
,  for  the  particular  measuring
current   used   in   the   test,   is   calculated   from   the
calibration  curve,  V
MC
vs.  T
MC
.  At  least  three  points
should  be  used  to  generate  the  voltage  vs.  temperature
curve  for  the  determination  of  the  TSP  temperature
coefficient.
Step 2 — Power application test.
The  power  application  test  is  performed  in  two  parts.
For   both   portions   of   the   test,   the   reference   point
temperature is held constant at a preset value. The first</p><p>SEMI G30-88 © SEMI 1986, 19884
measurement  to  be  made  is  that  of  the  temperature-
sensitive    parameter,    i.e.,    V
MC
,    under    operating
conditions  with  the  measuring  current,  I
M
,  used  during
the  calibration  procedure.  The  microelectronic  device
under  test  shall  then  be  operated  with  heating  power
(P
H
)   applied.   The   temperature-sensitive   parameter,
V
MH
,   shall   be   measured   with   constant   measuring
current,  I
M
,  that  was  applied  during  the  calibration
procedure (See Step 1).
The  heating  power,  P
H
,  shall  be  chosen  such  that  the
calculated    junction-to-reference    point    temperature
difference  as  measured  at  V
MH
is  greater  than  or  equal
to  20°C.  In  accomplishing  this,  the  device  under  test
should  not  be  operated  at  such  a  high  heating  power
level  that  the  on-chip  temperature-sensing  and  heating
circuitry  is  no  longer  electrically  isolated.  Care  should
also  be  taken  not  to  exceed  the  design  ratings  of  the
package-interconnect  system,  as  this  may  lead  to  an
overestimation  of  the  power  being  dissipated  in  the
active area of the chip due to excessive power losses in
the  package  leads  and  wire  bonds.  The  values  of  V
MH
,
V
MC
, and P
H
are recorded during the power application
test.
The  following  data  shall  be  recorded  for  these  test
conditions:
a.   Temperature-sensitive   electrical   parameters   (V

TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE ABRASIVE
CHARACTERISTICS OF MOLDING COMPOUNDS
1  Purpose
This  document  describes  the  method  to  measure  the
abrasive   characteristics   of   molding   compounds   by
measuring  mold  orifice  weight  loss  as  a  function  of
molded volume.
2 Scope
2. 1    All   thermoset   molding   compou nds   used   for
microelectronic   device   encapsulation   contain   filler
materials,  typically  60–90%  —  which  contribute  to
mold  wear.  Mold  wear,  typically  at  gates,  is  a  major
reason for mold rework. This test method may be used
by   suppliers   to   evaluate   new   molding   materials   or
control  current  materials  or  by  customers  to  evaluate
the  use  of  new  materials.  This  test  method  provides  a
comparison of abrasiveness between materials.
2. 2   This  procedure  can  be  used  to   determine  the
abrasive   character   of   a   given   molding   compound.
Knowing  the  conditions  of  test,  the  results  of  the  test,
and   the   mold   life   experience   (within   one’s   own
company)  in  the  field,  it  is  possible  to  judge  if  a
molding  compound  is  more  or  less  abrasive  to  current
compound in use.
