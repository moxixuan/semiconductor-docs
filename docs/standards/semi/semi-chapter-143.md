SEMI S21-1103 © SEMI 2003 6 8 Control of Hazardous EnergyNOTE 15: Control of hazardous energy is commonly knownas lock and tag or Lockout/Tagout. US OSHA regulation: 29CFR 1910.147 is one location where detailed information canbe found.8.1 Hazardous Energy Control (lockout/tagout) is amethod for isolating sources of hazardous energy fromequipment and protecting workers from accidentalrelease of the energy.8.2 Suppliers should identify all tasks that could beaffected by hazardous energy, (e.g., electrical,chemical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, stored,gravity or thermal) and should provide procedures foreffectively isolating such energy and safely restoringthe energy after performing each work task.8.3 Safe De-Energized Work Procedures8.3.1 PreparationNOTE 16: This list is not intended to be in any specific orderand the order may be changed to reflect individual conditions.a. Identify the task to be performed.b. Identify all energy sources and the location of themeans of isolation for each source.c. Notify potentially affected persons that the workwill be performed.d. Locate hazardous energy control procedures for thespecific system and task.e. Shut down equipment using normal shut downprocedures.f. Isolate all appropriate energy sources in the orderand manner specified in the procedures.NOTE 17: Certain procedures may require modification toaccount for factory-located energy isolation devices and tomeet local regulatory requirements.g. For electrical energy, turn off the power at theappropriate disconnection point.NOTE 18: If regulations have allowed multiple electricalenergy sources, (e.g., main power, emergency power, UPSpower) all sources of power must be identified. Each sourcethat may expose the worker should be isolated to ensure safeworking conditions.h. Verify absence of hazardous voltage at theequipment side of the disconnecting mechanism with anappropriate test device. The test device should be checked for correctoperation before and after testing for the presenceof hazardous electrical energy. i. Ensure that all energy is at zero state and that anycapacitors or other electrical energy storage devices arefully discharged or isolated.j. Follow any special steps needed to eliminate storedenergy (e.g., liquid or gas pressure, capacitors,compressed springs, support of a raised mass).k. Each person performing work should apply alocking device (under exclusive control of the worker)and a tag to each isolated energy source.NOTE 19: Some jurisdictions allow for group lockoutcapability. Entities creating procedures and personsperforming lockout should understand the procedures for thelocation.l. Verify that energy is no longer present (e.g., checkpressure, presence of liquid, weight, temperature)8.3.2 Performing Work Tasks8.3.2.1 Work may only be performed by persons whoare trained to work on the specific equipment.8.3.2.2 De-energized work may only occur after theperson has isolated the energy and applied a lock andtag to the energy isolation device.8.3.2.3 Work continuing past shift change should beprovided with special lockout transfer procedures (thatare usually controlled by the user) to ensure locks areapplied by the workers on the new shift and thatworkers on then previous shift have removed theirlocks.8.3.3 Restoration of Energy8.3.3.1 Remove all hand tools, parts and othermiscellaneous items may have been inadvertently left inthe area during the work.8.3.3.2 Ensure all safety devices have been restored.8.3.3.3 Notify all personnel who could be affected bythe potential hazard.8.3.3.4 Remove energy isolation devices (e.g., locks,tags blinds, barriers) in the order specified in the taskprocedures.8.3.3.5 After verifying that all persons are clear, restartthe system.8.3.3.5.1 Apply energy in the proper sequence for saferestart (e.g., power to interlocks and controls beforemain energy, power to interlocks before chemical re-pressurization).8.3.3.6 Verify equipment is operating properly.8.3.3.7 Reset all outer enclosure interlocks and secureouter enclosures.

SEMI S21-1103 © SEMI 20037 9 EEW at Hazardous Voltage or Energy Levels9.1 Hazardous electrical energy should be isolatedwhenever it is possible to perform the work with theequipment non-energized.9.2 When electrical energy cannot be isolated due tothe type of work to be performed (e.g., trouble-shooting, power supply adjustment), suppliers shouldidentify all tasks that include electrical-energized workand should provide procedures for safely accomplishingsuch work.9.2.1 Facility operators should verify, modify ifnecessary, and approve procedures before EEW isperformed at the facility.NOTE 20: Appropriate levels of PPE for EEW can only becalculated with knowledge of the energy available from thesource (e.g., sub-station, transformer) that provides powerfrom the facility to the equipment circuit.9.3 EEW or Working on Energized Electrical Circuitry9.3.1 Supplier should notify the user of any EEW thatmay be required.NOTE 21: Routine testing of circuits may be included in thedefinition of EEW in some circumstances and in somejurisdictions.9.3.1.1 Two or more qualified persons should performEEW, except for the routine testing of circuits.9.3.1.2 One worker should always have access to andbe ready to de-energize the system by operating theappropriate disconnecting device.NOTE 22: Some jurisdictions or users may require persons tobe trained in emergency rescue procedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) electrical shock first-aid, andextracting a person from an energized circuit.9.3.1.3 EEW should only be performed by workerswearing appropriate electrical PPE and natural fiberclothing for protection against shock, arc, flash, or burn.NOTE 23: Electrical PPE manufacturers have been testingcertain models of natural fiber or electrical protectivesynthetic fiber (e.g., Monofilament Nomex) for clean roompurposes, however, supplier personnel and users shouldcoordinate the use of clothing that is acceptable in the specificfactory.9.3.1.3.1 Clothing made from synthetic materials suchas acetate, nylon, polyester, or rayon, either alone or inblends with cotton, should not be worn for EEW athazardous energy levels where the exposure for arc,flash or burn exists; because it can melt and thereforefail to provide adequate protection.NOTE 24: Normal clean room clothing is made fromsynthetic fabrics and caution should be taken to provideadequate protection. NOTE 25: A Hazard/risk analysis may be used to determineavailable fault current and incident energy level in J/cm2.These calculated levels establish the level of natural fiber,calorie-rated flame resistant clothing and electrical PPEnecessary for protection. Calculation formulas andhazard/risk analysis methods are available in documents suchas ANSI/NFPA 70E.9.3.1.4 Metal jewelry (e.g., such as watches, rings,metal framed eyeglasses, and body-piercing jewelry)should be removed during EEW.9.3.1.5 During EEW, access to the immediate workarea should be restricted from unqualified workers bythe use of barricades, safety signs, safety cones, safetytape or a human guardian.9.4 Safe EEW procedures should be provided bysupplier and should include the following:a. Verification of valid reasons for performing thework energized.b. Identify electrical energy sources and the locationof the means of isolation for each source.NOTE 26: Identification is required to ensure that workersknow how to remove energy if an emergency develops duringthe work task.c. When the hazard is remote from the equipmentcontrols, the warning should also be provided at thepoint of the hazard.d. When the EEW is complete, workers shouldrestore the equipment to its original state and ensurethat all safeguards are restored and interlocks arefunctioning properly. 10 Radiation-Producing Equipment10.1.1 Ionizing Radiation10.1.1.1 Initial radiation surveys should be performedas required by regulations to verify that radiationshielding is installed.10.1.1.1.1 Additional radiation surveys should beconducted following maintenance or service tasks toensure shielding remains in place, and is effective.10.1.1.2 Access of unauthorized persons, to workingareas where there is a risk of exposure to hazardouslevels of radiation, should be restricted.10.1.1.3 If work associated with radiation is required,the workers should be trained on the hazardcharacteristics and appropriate protection measures,including safe handling, use, and shielding.NOTE 27: Certification of the people performing the workmay be required, depending on the work to be performed orthe type of radiation.

SEMI S22-1103a © SEMI 2003, 2005 8 5.1.68 types of electrical work  defined by the electrical energy levels a person is exposed to when performing atask. All tasks that should be performed on a system fall into one of the four following type categories of electricalwork:5.1.68.1 type 1  equipment is fully de-energized.5.1.68.2 type 2  equipment is energized. Energized circuits are covered or insulated with no exposed parts.NOTE 12: Type 2 work includes those tasks where the energized circuits are, or may be, measured by placing probes throughsuitable openings in the covers or insulators.5.1.68.3 type 3  equipment is energized. Energized circuits are exposed and inadvertent contact with un-insulatedenergized parts is possible. Potential exposures are not greater than 30 Volts rms, 42.4 Volts peak, 60 Volts DC, and240 volt-amps in dry locations.5.1.68.4 type 4  equipment is energized. Energized circuits are exposed and inadvertent contact with un-insulatedenergized parts is possible. Potential exposures are greater than 30 Volts rms, 42.4 Volts peak, 60 Volts DC, 240volt-amps in dry locations, or where induced or contact radio-frequency currents exceed the limits in SEMI S2.5.1.69 wire guide  any method of mechanically securing wire or cable into a restrictive routing. 6 Alternate Methods of Conformity6.1 The criteria in this document are based on harmonized basic electrical safety considerations. It is not the intentof this document to be the only means of demonstrating the electrical safety conformance of semiconductormanufacturing equipment.6.2 Equipment that satisfies other national or international electrical product safety standards meets the intent of thisdocument. 7 Design PhilosophyNOTE 13: This section is intended to provide general design guidance to engineers; for specific design considerations see 8through 22.7.1 This document should be used during the electrical design, construction, and evaluation phases ofsemiconductor manufacturing equipment. The intent of this safety guideline is to provide a design based electricaldocument that will be useful to both design engineers and evaluators, in order to facilitate electrical safety in theequipment.7.2 Designers that understand these general principles of safety are more likely to design safe equipment. Thissection is not an alternative to the more specific engineering considerations of this safety guideline, but is intendedto provide designers with an appreciation of the basic safety principles.7.3 Electric shock is due to current passing through the human body. Currents on the order of a milliampere maycause a reaction in people in good health, and may cause indirect mishap due to involuntary reactions. Highercurrents may have higher severity risks.7.4 Design of equipment should provided protection of personnel from electric shock or arc flash/blast that mayresult from reasonably forseeable single faults.7.5 Service and maintenance personnel should be protected against inadvertent contact with electrical hazards.7.6 Movable cord-connected equipment is considered to present a slightly increased risk of shock as well asoverheating, due to strain on the supply cord leading to damage to the connections, insulation, and the protectiveearthing conductor. With portable cord-connected equipment, wear on the cord is more likely, and further hazardscould arise if the equipment were dropped.7.7 Short-circuiting between phases and phase to ground of high current supplies or high capacitance circuits maycause arcing or ejection of molten metal which may cause burns. Even low voltage circuits may be dangerous in thisrespect. Protection should be provided by adequate separation, by shielding, or by using safety interlocks.7.8 When temperatures that could cause a hazard result from overloads, component failure, insulation breakdown,high resistance or loose connections, the risk of fire may be reduced by one or more of the following means:
