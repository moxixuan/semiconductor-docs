SEMI S1-0701 E © SEMI 1986, 20013 Figure 1Safety Alert Symbols for Signal Word Panel Use5.5 safety label  a sign, label, or decal that provides safety information.5.6 signal word  the word that calls attention to the safety label and designates a degree or level of hazardseriousness.5.7 surround shape  a geometric configuration that is placed around a symbol and which conveys additionalsafety information.5.8 symbol  a graphical representation, either abstract or representational, of a hazard, a consequence of engaginga hazard, or a method to avoid a hazard, or some combination of these ideas.NOTE 6: Some label design standards use the term pictorial in the same sense as this guideline uses the term symbol.5.9 target audience  the audience to be advised of the hazard. 6 General Provisions6.1 Safety labels should communicate information about specific hazards. Safety labels should be simple, direct,and understandable by the target audience.6.2 Content  Safety labels should communicate:6.2.1 the seriousness of the hazard (indicated by the signal word);6.2.2 the nature of the hazard (e.g., type of hazard) or the probable consequence of engaging the hazard; and6.2.3 how the hazard can be avoided.6.3 See Figure 2 for examples of how this information can be communicated on a safety label.

&lt;!-- Page 7 --&gt;

SEMI S1-0701 E © SEMI 1986, 2001 4 Figure 2Examples of How Product Safety Labels Communicate Content(Note that the order and content of the word message is flexible).6.4 Identifier  Safety labels should have a unique identifier (e.g., a part number) printed on the label, to facilitateordering replacement labels from the equipment manufacturer.NOTE 7: If a safety label becomes illegible, the user may want to replace it.6.5 Durability  Safety labels should have a reasonable useful life. Determination of reasonable useful life shouldtake into consideration the expected life of the product and the intended environment of use.NOTE 8: Two factors that may be used for judging useful life are color stability and legibility when viewed at a safe viewingdistance. Legibility is affected by letter height. 7 Formats7.1 Safety labels should consist of at least three panels: signal word panel, word message panel, and symbol panel.Figure 3 provides examples of some possible horizontal and vertical formats incorporating these panels.EXCEPTION 1: A symbol panel is not necessary for labels that indicate only potential property damage hazards.EXCEPTION 2: When space limitations exist, such as under guards or on small parts, for safety labels whose targetaudience is maintenance or service personnel, symbol-only formats with surround shapes (i.e., no signal word, wordmessage, or symbol panels; see Figures 7, 8, and 9) may be used. In this case, borders around the surround shapesshould be used. Alternatively, for the same situations, a safety label may be used that has a signal word panel and aword message panel but does not have a symbol panel.

SEMI S1-0701 E © SEMI 1986, 20017 Figure 5Signal Word Panels 8.2.2 The safety alert symbol should not be used to alert persons to property-damage-only hazards.8.2.3 When multiple hazard situations are addressed on one safety label, and the hazards are classified at differentlevels of seriousness, the signal word corresponding to the greatest hazard level should be used. 9 Symbols9.1 Symbols are graphic representations chosen to convey specific safety messages.9.2 The symbol panel should contain the safety labels symbol(s).9.2.1 More than one symbol panel may be used on a safety label.NOTE 11: See also Section 7.2.9.2.2 More than one symbol may be used in each symbol panel.9.3 Symbols may be used to clarify or supplement a portion of a safety labels word message.NOTE 12: In some cases, symbols may replace the word message. See the exception to Section 10.2.9.4 A symbol should represent the nature of the hazard, or the potential consequence of engaging the hazard, oractions to be taken to avoid the hazard.9.5 Symbols should be compatible with the safety labels word message.NOTE 13: It is preferable to use the symbols shown in Appendix 1.NOTE 14: For additional information on symbol design, see Annex A of ANSI Z535.3.9.6 Symbols should be shown in their appropriate surround shape as defined in Section 9.10.9.7 When an effective symbol does not exist or cannot be created to illustrate the specific hazard or specificavoidance information, the ISO 3864 general warning symbol should be used with a text message that conveysspecific information about the hazard (see Figure 6).

&lt;!-- Page 11 --&gt;

SEMI S1-0701 E © SEMI 1986, 2001 8 Figure 6Safety Label with General Warning Symbol 9.8 Location  Symbols should be located on safety labels in the areas designated in the examples in Figures 2, 3,and 4, or located in a similar manner. If multiple symbols are used on a multi-hazard safety label, the symbolsshould appear in the same order as the safety information described in the word message.EXCEPTION: Location of the safety alert symbol is governed by section 8.2.1.9.9 Safety Alert Symbol  The safety alert symbol is composed of an equilateral triangle surrounding anexclamation mark.NOTE 15: See Figures 1 and 5 and Section 12.3.4 for format and color information.9.10 Symbol Surround Shapes  Safety symbols should be shown in their appropriate surround shapes (see Figures7, 8, and 9).NOTE 16: This is for purposes of international harmonization. The surround shapes have been taken from ISO 3864 and IEC61310-1.9.10.1 Hazard Identification Surround Shape (see Figure 7)  A symbol located inside a hazard identificationsurround shape should be used to indicate a personal injury hazard.9.10.1.1 Format and Color  The background color should be yellow. The triangular band should be black. Thesymbol or pictorial representing the hazard should be black. The border should be yellow; the border is optional ifthe surrounding background is yellow or white. See Figure 7 for more information.

The symbol representing the mandatory actionshould be white. The border should be white; the border is optional if the surrounding background is white. SeeFigure 9 for more information. Figure 9Mandatory Action Symbol Surround Shape10 Word Message10.1 The word message is placed in the word message panel.10.2 The word message preferably contains a description of the hazard, the consequence of engaging the hazard,and how to avoid the hazard. The ordering of this content in the word message is flexible.EXCEPTION: Parts or all of the word message may be omitted, depending on such factors as whether the messagecan be inferred from a symbol, other text messages, user training, or the context in which the safety label is used.10.3 The word message on a safety label should be concise and readily understood.10.4 Messages on the same safety label that warn of different hazards should be formatted, when feasible, toprevent them from visually blending together. Bullets, lines, and extra line spacing are examples of such formatting.10.5 When detailed instructions, precautions, or consequences would require a lengthy message, the message mayalternatively refer the reader to another source for additional safety information. Examples of such sources includesafety instructions, operation and maintenance manuals, service manuals, operating procedures, and safety bulletins. 11 Lettering11.1 Signal words should be in the lettering style shown in Appendix 2.

&lt;!-- Page 13 --&gt;

SEMI S1-0701 E © SEMI 1986, 2001 10 11.2 For languages using the Roman alphabet, such as the official languages used in the Americas and in much ofthe European Union, the lettering should be a combination of upper- and lowercase sans serif letters. Uppercase onlylettering may be used for short messages or for emphasis of individual words.NOTE 17: Preferred Roman sans serif lettering styles include those named Arial, Arial Bold, Folio Medium, Franklin Gothic,Helvetica, Helvetica Bold, and Univers.11.3 Lettering should be of a size that enables a person with normal vision, including corrected vision, to read thesafety label at a safe viewing distance from the hazard.NOTE 18: Related Information 1 provides an example of a method of calculating minimum letter heights.NOTE 19: The proportions and spacing of individual letters also affect readability. 12 Colors12.1 Color Specifications  Colors should conform to those colors specified in ISO 3864.NOTE 20: For purposes of reproduction, the closest PANTONE® color match for opaque safety colors is: Red  PANTONE 485 Orange  PANTONE 152 Yellow  PANTONE 109 Blue  PANTONE 2945(PANTONE® is a registered trademark of Pantone, Inc.).NOTE 21: Perceived color will be different under colored light (e.g., yellow room) conditions. The committee knows of nocurrent technical solution.12.2 Symbol and Surround Shape Color Specifications  See section 9.10 for symbol and surround shape colorcriteria.12.3 Signal Word Panel  The three signal words should be colored as follows (see Figure 5):12.3.1 The word DANGER should be in white letters on a red background.12.3.2 The word WARNING should be in black letters on an orange background.12.3.3 The word CAUTION should be in black letters on a yellow background.12.3.4 Safety Alert Symbol  The solid triangle portion should be the same color as the signal word lettering, andthe exclamation mark portion should be the same color as the signal word panel background.12.4 Optional Use of Red  The color red may be used in a symbol to indicate heat or fire. 13 Placement13.1 Location of Safety Labels  Safety labels should be permanently attached to the equipment and, whenpossible, located near the hazard.13.2 Safe Viewing Distance  Safety labels should be placed to allow the viewer enough time to: be informed by the safety label; and have sufficient time to avoid the hazard or take appropriate evasive action to reduce the potential harm from thehazard.13.3 Placement  Safety labels should be placed so that they are legible, non-distracting, and not hazardous inthemselves.13.4 Inadvertent Removal, Visual Blockage  Safety labels should not be located in areas where they may beremoved by the motion of equipment or rendered ineffective by situational conditions.13.4.1 Safety labels should not be blocked from view by moveable panels such as doors, windows, and racks wherethis would limit the effectiveness of the blocked label.

SEMI S1-0701 E © SEMI 1986, 2001 12 APPENDIX 1SAFETY SYMBOLS NOTE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI S1 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures on April 30,2001 by the North American Regional Standards Committee.This appendix illustrates symbols used on safety labels for hazards commonly found in the semiconductormanufacturing industry. Additional symbols may need to be developed for other hazards (see ANSI Z535.3-1998Informative Annex A for an example of symbol development guidelines).To determine what symbol should be used on a safety label, it is first necessary to determine what message is to becommunicated. Symbols may enhance a safety labels meaning and may be useful to communicate across manylanguages.When appropriate, the following symbols should be used.NOTE A1-1: Some symbols (e.g., laser, biohazard, and radiation) are required by law or regulation in some jurisictions.Table A1-1 Hazard Identification Symbols# Referent Source Symbol Description1 Flammable Material IEC 61310 Flames 2 Explosive Material,Explosion HazardIEC 61310 Object exploding 3 Danger: Electricity,Electrical HazardIEC 61310, ISO3864Lightning bolt 4 Corrosive Material,CorrosionIEC 61310 Test tube, hand, drops 5 Toxic Material,PoisonIEC 61310 Skull and crossbones 6 Slip Hazard ANSI Z535.3 Person falling on surface 7 Trip Hazard ANSI Z535.3 Person tripping over object

The risk assessment should consider normaloperations and reasonably foreseeable single-pointfailures within the equipment. It should not considerexposure to fire or external ignition sources not withinthe specified use environment.NOTE 46: This risk assessment can be combined with theoverall hazard analysis performed for this guideline, providedthe risk assessor has the required professional expertise toperform risk assessments for fire hazards. SEMI S7 describesqualifications for such an assessor.14.2.2 If an accurate risk assessment depends on theusers adherence to specified procedures or conditionsof use, the supplier should describe such procedures orconditions and state their importance.14.2.3 SEMI S14 should be used to assess and reportrisks to property and the environment.14.3 Reporting14.3.1 A summary report should be provided to theuser. The summary should include the followingcharacterizations, per SEMI S10, for each residual firehazard identified: the assigned Severity; the assigned Likelihood; and the resulting Risk Category.14.3.2 Optional fire risk reduction features should bedescribed in the pre-purchase information provided tothe user.14.3.3 The scope and effectiveness of the means of firerisk reduction should also be identified and reported,including the expected risk reduction (as described inSection 14.3.1).14.3.4 If, due to fire hazards within the equipment,thermal or non-thermal (e.g., smoke) damage ispossible outside of the equipment, then this possibilityshould be reported to the user. This report shouldinclude a qualitative description of the foreseenscenario.14.4 Fire Risk Reduction14.4.1 Materials of Construction  Equipment shouldbe constructed of noncombustible materials whereverreasonable. If process chemicals do not permit the useof noncombustible construction, then the equipmentshould be constructed of materials, suitable for the usesand compatible with the process chemicals used, thatcontribute least to the fire risk.

SEMI S2-0703aE © SEMI 1991, 200417 NOTE 47: Some regional codes (e.g., Uniform Fire Code)may require construction with noncombustible materials.14.4.1.1 The flowchart in Appendix 6 may be used forthe selection of materials of construction for equipment.14.4.1.2 Any portion of equipment that falls within thescope of SEMI F14 (Guide for the Design of GasSource Equipment Enclosures) should be designed inaccordance with that guide.14.4.2 Elimination of Process Chemical Hazards The option of substituting non-flammable processchemicals for flammable process chemicals should beconsidered.14.4.3 Engineering Controls14.4.3.1 Fire risks resulting from process chemicalsmay be reduced using engineering controls (e.g.,preventing improper chemical mixing, preventingtemperatures from reaching the flash point).14.4.3.2 Fire risks resulting from materials ofconstruction may be reduced using engineering controls(e.g., non-combustible barriers that separatecombustible materials of construction from ignitionsources, installing a fire suppression system thatextinguishes ignited materials).14.4.3.3 Equipment power and chemical sources thatpresent unacceptable fire risks should be interlockedwith the fire detection and suppression systems toprevent start-up of the equipment or delivery ofchemicals when the fire detection or suppression isinactive.NOTE 48: Some jurisdictions require interlocking.NOTE 49: Refer to Section 6.5 for criteria for acceptability.14.4.3.4 Shutdown or failure of a fire detection orsuppression system need not interrupt the processing ofproduct within the equipment by immediately shuttingdown the equipment, but should prevent additionalprocessing until the fire detection or suppression isrestored. Software or hardware may be used for thisfunction.14.4.3.5 Controlling smoke by exhausting it (using thesupplier-specified equipment exhaust) from thecleanroom may be used to reduce fire risks from thegeneration of products of combustion. When used, thisreduction method should be combined with detection orsuppression when flames can be propagated.NOTE 50: Controlling smoke may be sufficient when smokeis the only consequence (e.g., smoldering components thatgenerate smoke).NOTE 51: For controlling smoke to be effective, the smokemust be removed not only from the equipment, but also from the cleanroom. This is typically accomplished by using ductedexhaust.NOTE 52: The use of exhaust to remove smoke may besubject to regulations, such as building and fire codes.NOTE 53: The use of exhaust to remove smoke may createhazards within the exhaust system. Therefore, a description ofthe expected discharge (i.e., anticipated air flow rate,temperature, and rate of smoke generation) into the exhaustsystem may be important information for installation ofequipment.14.4.4 Fire Detection  The following criteria applyto any fire detection system determined to beappropriate for fire protection by the fire riskassessment:NOTE 54: Heat detectors, smoke sensing devices, and otherdevices used solely for monitoring equipment status may notneed to meet these requirements.

For the purpose of this section, inoperableincludes the equipment states after an EMO is activatedand after the equipment has had its hazardous energiesisolated (i.e., has been locked out). Therefore, thedetection system should not require hazardous voltages(e.g., line alternating current) to operate anything otherthan the equipment within the detection systemscontrol enclosure. Sensors and other devices outsidethe detection systems control enclosure should notrequire hazardous voltage.EXCEPTION: Operability is not required duringmaintenance of the fire detection system.14.4.4.7.1 Power at a hazardous voltage may besupplied to the detection system controller enclosureafter the equipment EMO is activated or after theequipment has had its hazardous energies isolated onlyif the wiring providing the hazardous voltage isseparated from other wiring and is suitably labeled.14.4.4.7.2 If the hazardous voltage supply to thedetection system controller is not disconnected by theenergy isolation method that removes the otherhazardous voltages from the equipment, there must alsobe separate hazardous energy isolation capability forthe hazardous voltage supplies to the detection systemcontroller enclosure.14.4.4.8 A battery or other regulatory agencyacceptable emergency power alternative, capable ofsustaining the detection system for 24 hours, should beprovided.NOTE 57: Back-up power must be provided in accordancewith local regulations.

It may bepreferable for the equipment supplier to specify thelocation and performance of suppression systemcomponents, but not provide them, so that the user maybetter integrate the suppression in the equipment withthat in the facility. This alternative should be negotiatedexplicitly with the user.14.4.5.4 The assessment of the equipment to SEMI S2should include the risks associated with the suppressionsystems.NOTE 62: This includes risks (e.g., chemical exposure,noise, and asphyxiation) introduced by the incorporation ofthe suppression system.14.4.5.5 Activation of the fire suppression systemshould alarm audibly and visually at the equipment.This may be done by the same system that initiatesactivation.14.4.5.6 If the discharge is likely to present a risk topersonnel, the alarm should provide adequate time toallow personnel to avoid the hazard of the agentdischarge.14.4.5.6.1 If there is a confined space in the equipment,the asphyxiation hazard posed by the suppressionsystem should be assessed.14.4.5.7 The fire suppression system should be capableof operating at all times, including when equipment isinoperable and during equipment maintenance.NOTE 63: For the purpose of this section, inoperableincludes the equipment state after the EMO is activated.EXCEPTION: Most suppression systems containsources of hazardous energy. These sources should becapable of being isolated (i.e., locked out) to protectpersonnel.14.4.5.8 The fire suppression system should remainactive following EMO activation.14.4.5.9 There may be cases where the internal powersupply for a suppression system cannot supply powerfor the full length of extended maintenance procedures(i.e., procedures longer than the expected duration ofthe back-up power supply). In such cases, the suppliershould provide written procedures for either removingthe fire hazard or safely supplying power to the firesuppression system. 14.4.5.10 Allowances can be made to provide for thedeactivation of an automatic discharge of thesuppression system when in the maintenance mode.Such deactivation switches should be supervised (i.e., ifthe suppression system is deactivated, there should bean indication to the user and the resumption ofproduction in the equipment should be prevented.)NOTE 64: Hazardous energies associated with the firesuppression system may be isolated (i.e., locked out) usingan energy isolation procedure (see Section 17) duringequipment maintenance.NOTE 65: The permissibility of deactivation of suppressionsystems varies among jurisdictions.14.4.5.11 A back-up power supply, capable ofsustaining the suppression system for 24 hours, shouldbe included where the suppression system requiresindependent power from the detection system used toactivate the suppression.NOTE 66: The requirements for back-up power vary amongjurisdictions.14.4.5.12 The fire suppression system should becapable of interfacing with the facilitys alarm system.This may be done via the fire detection system.14.4.5.13 Activation of the fire suppression systemshould shut down the equipment within the shortesttime period that allows for safe equipment shutdown.NOTE 67: See Sections 14.4.3.3 and 14.4.3.4 for relatedprovisions.EXCEPTION: Activation of the fire suppression systemshould not remove power from fire and safety systems.14.4.5.14 The fire suppression system should becapable of manual activation, which should shut downthe equipment and activate an alarm signal locally andat a constantly attended location.14.4.5.15 The fire suppression system should be testedon a representative sample of the equipment. The testprocedure should include a suppression agent dischargetest, unless precluded for health or environmentalreasons. This test may be performed at the equipmentsuppliers or other similar facility, but should beperformed under conditions that adequately duplicateany factors (e.g., equipment exhaust) that may reducethe effectiveness of the suppression. This representativesample need not be fully operational, but shouldduplicate those factors (e.g., exhaust, air flow) thatcould negatively affect the performance of the system.14.4.5.16 Procedures for controlling access to thesuppression agent source (e.g., protecting agentcylinders from disconnection by unauthorizedpersonnel) should be provided.

Certified drawings and calculations may berequired in some jurisdictions.19.1 General  The equipment should be designed tocontrol the risk of injury to personnel, adverseenvironmental impact, equipment and facility damagedue to movement, overturning, or leakage of chemicals(including liquid splashing), during a seismic event.The design should also control equipment damage dueto failure of fragile parts (e.g., quartzware, ceramics)during a seismic event.NOTE 82: These criteria are intended to accomplish twothings:(1) allow equipment suppliers to correctly design theinternal frame and components to withstand seismic forces;and(2) allow equipment designers to provide end-users with theinformation needed to appropriately secure the equipmentwithin their facility.19.1.1 Because preventing all damage to equipmentmay be impractical, the design should control thefailure of parts that may result in increased hazard (e.g.,hazardous materials release, fire, projectile).NOTE 83: It is recommended that the hazard analysisdescribed in Section 6.8 be used to evaluate both the risk ofpart failure and the effectiveness of control measures.19.1.1.1 These parts should be accessible forevaluation of damage.NOTE 84: SEMI S8 contains guidelines for maintainabilityand serviceability; these may be used to determineaccessibility.19.2 Design Loads  The equipment, subassemblies,and all devices used for anchoring the equipmentshould be designed as follows:19.2.1 For equipment containing hazardous productionmaterials (HPMs), the equipment should be designed towithstand a horizontal loading of 94% of the weight ofthe equipment, acting at the equipments center ofmass.19.2.2 For equipment not containing hazardousproduction materials (HPMs), the equipment should bedesigned to withstand a horizontal loading of 63% ofthe weight of the equipment, acting at the equipmentscenter of mass.NOTE 85: Subassemblies may include transformers, vessels,power supplies, vacuum pumps, monitors, fire suppression components, or other items of substantial mass that areattached to the equipment.19.2.3 Horizontal loads should be calculatedindependently on each of the X and Y axes, or on theaxis that produces the largest loads on the anchoragepoints.19.2.4 When calculating for overturning, a maximumvalue of 85% of the weight of the equipment should beused to resist the overturning moment.NOTE 86: Because equipment may be placed into serviceanywhere in the world, it is recommended that the seismicprotection design of the equipment be based uponrequirements that allow the equipment, as designed, to beinstalled in most sites worldwide. The above loads are basedon 1997 Uniform Building Code (UBC) requirements forrigid equipment in Seismic Zone 4, and are assumed to satisfymost design situations worldwide.NOTE 87: If the equipment or internal component is flexibleas defined by the UBC, is located above the midheight of thebuilding, or is within 5 km of a major active fault, thehorizontal design loadings in Sections 19.2.1 and 19.2.2 maynot be conservative. Likewise, there are several conditions forwhich the horizontal design loadings are overly conservative(e.g., rigid equipment with rigid internal components locatedat grade, or sites with favorable soils conditions). For theseconditions, designing based on the more detailed approach inthe UBC may result in a more economical design. It isrecommended that the user engage a professional mechanical,civil, or structural engineer to make these determinations.19.3 The supplier should provide the following dataand procedures to the user. This information should beincluded in the installation instructions as part of thedocumentation covered in Section 9. A drawing of the equipment, its support equipment,its connections (e.g., ventilation, water, vacuum,gases) and the anchorage locations identified inSection 19.4. The type of feet used and their location on a baseframe plan drawing. The weight distribution on each foot. Physical dimensions, including width, length, andheight of each structurally independent module. Weight and location of the center of mass for eachstructurally independent module. Acceptable locations on the equipment frame foranchorage.NOTE 88: A structurally independent module reacts toseismic loads by transferring substantially all of the loads toits own anchorages, as opposed to transferring the loads toadjacent modules.

SEMI S2-0703aE © SEMI 1991, 2004 24 19.4 The locations of the tie-ins, attachments, orseismic anchorage points should be clearly identified.NOTE 89: It is not the intent of SEMI S2 that the supplierprovide the seismic attachment point hardware. Suchhardware may be provided as agreed upon between supplierand user.NOTE 90: It is the responsibility of the user to verify that thevibration isolation, leveling, seismic reinforcing, and loaddistribution is adequate. 20 Automated Material Handlers20.1 This section covers automated material handlers,which include: substrate handlers; industrial robots and industrial robot systems; and unmanned transport vehicles (UTVs).NOTE 91: Substrate handlers typically handle a singlesubstrate at a time, and are distinguished from industrialrobots by their small load capacity.20.2 General  The means of incorporating personnelsafeguarding into automated material handlers shouldbe based on a hazard analysis. The hazard analysisshould include consideration of the size, capacity,speed, and spatial operating range of the handler.20.2.1 Subsystem Stops  If a separate stop button isused for the automated material handler, it should bedifferentiated from the EMO button.20.3 Substrate Handlers  See Section 20.2, General.20.4 Industrial Robots and Industrial Robot Systems Industrial robots and industrial robot systems shouldmeet the requirements of appropriate national orinternational standards, e.g., ANSI/RIA R15.06, ISO10218, EN 775. If there are deviations from thesestandards because of semiconductor applications of therobot, these deviations may be found acceptable basedon risk assessments.20.5 UTVsNOTE 92: There are two basic types of UTVs: (1) the floor-traveling (including both rail-guided and rail-independent)UTV, that automatically travels on the floor to a specifieddestination where it is unloaded or loaded; and (2) the space-traveling UTV, which automatically travels without resting onthe floor (e.g., in the space below the ceiling) to a specifieddestination where it is loaded or unloaded. UTVs do notinclude rail-guided mechanisms that are attached toequipment (such as in wet benches).20.5.1 Collision Avoidance  UTVs generally travelin wide areas and are used in a system rather than standalone operation. UTVs should be equipped with a non- contact approach sensing device so that they do notinadvertently contact people or other objects.20.5.2 UTVs: Loading and Unloading Equipment20.5.2.1 UTVs should be interlocked with equipmentsuch as semiconductor process equipment, automatedload ports, stockers, ground-based conveyors, andautomated warehouses as needed to ensure that the loadremains secure and that the UTV and transfercomponents are not in conflict with one another.20.5.2.2 If loading results in an unsafe condition, theequipment should detect and indicate the condition, andmovement of all loading equipment should stopimmediately. The system should not reset or restartautomatically. 21 Environmental Considerations21.1 This section covers environmental impactsthroughout the life of the equipment.NOTE 93: It is recommended that environmental impacts bebalanced against other factors, including safety and health,legal, and regulatory requirements.NOTE 94: It is recommended that the manufacturer maintainawareness of relevant environmental regulations, eitherinternally or through the user.NOTE 95: The user is responsible for providing themanufacturer with information regarding any environmentalrestrictions that are specific to a given site and that mayimpact equipment design (e.g., cumulative emissions limits,permit requirements, site-specific programs).NOTE 96: See Section 14 for fire suppression emissionissues.NOTE 97: References to process in this section are meantto refer to the baseline process.21.2 Design21.2.1 The following design guidelines apply to allphases of equipment life, from concept todecommissioning and disposal.NOTE 98: The documentation described in Sections 8.5.3and 9.4 provide information that can be used for evaluatingconformance to this section.21.2.2 Resource Conservation21.2.2.1 The manufacturer should consider resourceconservation (i.e., reduction, reuse, recycling) duringequipment design, for example: water reuse or water recycling within theequipment; reduced chemical consumption, energy use, andwater use (e.g., reducing resource use when noprocess is occurring);

&lt;!-- Page 46 --&gt;

SEMI S2-0703aE © SEMI 1991, 200425  reduced use of resources during maintenanceprocedures (e.g., parts cleaning procedures couldinclude minimum rinse rates and rinse times); recycling or reusing chemicals in the equipment,rather than consuming only new materials; reducing volume of packaging, increasing recycledcontent of packaging, and/or designing reusablepackaging.21.2.3 Chemical Selection21.2.3.1 Chemical selection for process, maintenance,and utility uses (e.g., gases, etchants, strippers, cleaners,lubricants, and coolants) should take into accounteffectiveness, environmental impacts, volume, toxicity,by-products, decommissioning, disposal, andrecyclability; use of the least hazardous chemical ispreferred. To the extent practicable, the utilities,maintenance, and process should be designed so thatthe equipment operates without the use of: ozone depleting substances (ODSs) as identified bythe Montreal Protocol, such as chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs), methylchloroform, hydrochlorofluoro-carbons (HCFCs), and carbon tetrachloride, or perfluorocompounds (PFCs), including CF 4, C2F 6,NF 3, C3F 8, and SF 6, and CHF 3 due to their globalwarming potential.21.2.4 Prevention and Control of Unintended Releases21.2.4.1 Equipment design, including feed, storage,and waste collection systems, should prevent potentialunintended releases. At a minimum:21.2.4.2 Secondary containment for liquids should becapable of holding at least 110% (see first row of TableA3-1 of Appendix 3) of the volume of the single largestcontainer, or the largest expected volume for any singlepoint failure.NOTE 99: In some circumstances secondary containmentmay be specified by the equipment supplier, but provided bythe user.21.2.4.3 Chemical storage containers and secondarycontainment should be designed for accessibility andeasy removal of collected material.21.2.4.4 Secondary containment should have alarmsand gas detection or liquid sensing, as appropriate, orhave recommended sensing points identified in theequipment installation instructions.21.2.4.5 Equipment design should allow personnel todetermine all in-equipment container levelsconveniently without having to open the containers,where ignorance of the level could result in aninadvertent release. 21.2.4.6 Overfill level detectors and alarms should beprovided for in-equipment containers.21.2.4.7 Secondary containment and other controlsystems should be designed to ensure that chemicalscannot be combined, where the combination couldresult in an inadvertent release.21.2.4.8 Equipment components should be compatiblewith chemicals used in the manufacturing process.Chemical systems should be designed for the specifiedoperating conditions, and have sufficient mechanicalstrength and corrosion resistance for the intended use.21.2.4.9 Equipment should be able to accept a signalfrom a monitoring device and stop the supply ofchemical, at the first non-manual valve within theaffected system.21.2.4.10 Chemical distribution systems should becapable of automatic shutoff and remote shutdown.21.2.5 Effluents, Wastes, and EmissionsNOTE 100: It is recommended that the manufacturerdocument its efforts to minimize the equipments generationof hazardous wastes, solid wastes, wastewater, and airemissions.NOTE 101: It is recommended that SEMI F5 be used forguidance in gaseous effluent handling.21.2.5.1 Equipment design that allows connection to acentral waste collection system is preferred, exceptwhere collection at the equipment may facilitaterecycling or reuse opportunities or otherwise reduceenvironmental impacts.NOTE 102: It is recommended that individual drains andexhausts be kept separate (e.g., separate outlets for acid drain,solvent drain, deionized (DI) water drain; acid exhaust,solvent exhaust).21.2.5.1.1 Point-of-use collection containers should bedesigned for accessibility as well as the possible reuseand recycling of the collected materials.21.2.5.2 Equipment should use partitions, double-contained lines, or other similar design features toprevent the mixing of incompatible waste streams.21.2.5.3 The manufacturer should evaluate thefeasibility of including integrated controls for effluentand emission treatment.21.2.5.4 Dilution in excess of process or safetyrequirements should not be used to reduce contaminantdischarge concentrations.21.2.5.5 Segregation of effluents, wastes, andemissions should be provided in the following cases: where chemically incompatible;

&lt;!-- Page 47 --&gt;

SEMI S2-0703aE © SEMI 1991, 2004 26  where segregation facilitates recycling or reuse; or where separate abatement or treatment methods arerequired.NOTE 103: It is recommended that the equipment designdocumentation show evidence of consideration of by-productsgenerated during equipment operation, clean-up, maintenance,and repair. By-products can include deposits in drains orducts, and replaceable parts (e.g., batteries, vapor lamps,contaminated parts).21.2.6 Decommissioning and Disposal21.2.6.1 Equipment design should address (see Section8.5.3 for documentation provisions) constructionmaterial and component reuse, refurbishment, andrecycling.21.2.6.2 The equipment should be designed to facilitateequipment decontamination and disposal, e.g., by use ofremovable liners or replaceable modules. This includesminimizing the number of parts that becomecontaminated with hazardous materials.NOTE 104: It is recommended that SEMI S12 Guidelinesfor Equipment Decontamination be used for guidance duringequipment decontamination. 22 Exhaust Ventilation22.1 Equipment exhaust ventilation should be designedto prevent potentially hazardous chemical exposures toemployees as follows:22.1.1 As primary control when normal operationspresent potentially hazardous chemical exposures toemployees by diffusive emissions that cannot beotherwise prevented or controlled (e.g., wet decks, spincoaters).NOTE 105: In the context of this section, primary controlmeans that it is the control of first choice (e.g., rather thanpersonal protective equipment).22.1.2 As supplemental control when intermittentactivities (e.g., chamber cleaning, implant sourcehousing cleaning) present potentially hazardouschemical exposures to employees which cannotreasonably be controlled by other means. Supplementalexhaust hoods or enclosures may be integrated into theequipment design, or supplied completely by theequipment user.22.1.2.1 When a procedure (e.g., cleaning) specified bythe supplier requires exhaust ventilation, the suppliershould include the minimum criteria for exhaust duringthe procedure.22.1.3 As secondary control when a single-pointfailure presents the potential for employee exposures tohazardous materials, and this exposure cannot be controlled by other means (e.g., use of all weldedfittings).EXCEPTION: Secondary exhaust control enclosuresfor non-welded connections (e.g., valve manifold boxesthat enclose piping jungles) are not included in thisguideline for those hazardous gases that are transportedbelow atmospheric pressure (e.g., via vacuum pipingsystems) if it can be demonstrated that equivalent leakprotection is provided. Equivalent protection mayinclude such things as equipping the vacuum deliverysystem with a fail-safe (e.g., to close) valveautomatically activated by a loss of vacuum pressure.Loss of vacuum pressure should also activate a visualand audible alarm provided in visual or audible range ofthe operator.22.2 Equipment exhaust ventilation should be designedand a ventilation assessment conducted (see Section23.5, Appendix 2, and SEMI S6) to control, efficientlyand safely, for potential worst-case, realistic employeeexposures to chemicals during normal operation,maintenance, or failure of other equipment components(hardware or software). All design criteria and testprotocols should be based on recognized methods. Seealso Section 23.3.22.3 Documentation should be developed showing theequipment exhaust parameters and relevant testmethods, and should include (see also Appendix 2): duct velocity (where needed to transport solidparticles); volumetric flow rate Q; capture velocity (where airborne contaminants aregenerated outside an enclosure); face velocity (where applicable); hood entry loss factor Fh or K; coefficient of entry Ce.; hood static pressure SPh; duct diameter at the point of connection tofacilities; and location(s) on the duct or hood where allventilation measurements were taken.22.4 Exhaust flow interlocks should be provided by themanufacturer on all equipment that uses hazardousproduction materials (HPMs) where loss of exhaustmay create a hazard. Flow (e.g., pitot probe) or staticpressure (e.g., manometer) switches are the preferredsensing methods.

&lt;!-- Page 48 --&gt;

SEMI S2-0703aE © SEMI 1991, 200427 NOTE 106: Sail switches (switches that are connected to alever that relies upon air velocity to activate) are generally notrecommended.NOTE 107: It is recommended that the pressure or flowmeasuring point be located upstream of the first damper.NOTE 108: Section 11 contains provisions for safetyinterlocks.22.4.1 When the exhaust falls below the prescribed setpoint, an alarm should be provided within audible orvisible range of the operator, and the process equipmentshould be placed in a safe stand-by mode. A time delayand exhaust setpoint for the equipment to go intostandby mode may be allowable, based on anappropriate risk assessment. The system should becapable of interfacing with the facility alarm system.NOTE 109: It is recommended that non-HPM chemicalprocess exhaust be equipped with audible and visibleindicators only.22.4.2 Exhaust flow interlocks and alarms shouldrequire manual resetting.22.4.3 Exhaust flow interlocks should be fault-tolerant.22.5 Equipment and equipment components should bedesigned using good ventilation principles and practicesto ensure chemical capture and to optimize exhaustefficiency (see Appendix 2).NOTE 110: It is recommended that exhaust optimization beachieved with total equipment static pressure requirements of1 to 38 mm (0.05 to 1.5") H 2O (see also Section A2-1 ofAppendix 2, and Section 8.3.6.1 of SEMI S6-93). 23 Chemicals23.1 The manufacturer should generate a chemicalinventory identifying the chemicals anticipated to beused or generated in the equipment. At a minimum, thisshould include chemicals in the recipe used forequipment qualification or baseline recipe, as well asintended reaction products and anticipated by-products.Chemicals on this list that can be classified ashazardous production materials (HPMs), or odorous(odor threshold &lt; 1 ppm) or irritant chemicals(according to their material safety data sheets), shouldalso be identified.23.2 A hazard analysis (see Section 6.8) should beused as an initial determination of chemical risk as wellas to validate that the risk has been controlled to anappropriate level.23.2.1 The hazard analysis, at a minimum, shouldaddress the following conditions: potential mixing of incompatible chemicals;  potential chemical emissions during routineoperation; potential chemical emissions during maintenanceactivities; and potential key failure points and trouble spots (e.g.,fittings, pumps).23.2.2 All routes of exposure (e.g., respiratory, dermal)should be considered in exposure assessment.23.3 The order of preference for controls in reducingchemical-related risks is as follows:23.3.1 substitution or elimination (see also Section21.2.2);23.3.2 engineering controls (e.g., enclosure,ventilation, interlocks);23.3.3 administrative controls (e.g., written warnings,standard operating procedures);23.3.4 personal protective equipment.23.4 The design of engineering controls (e.g.,enclosure, ventilation, interlocks) should includeconsideration of (see also Appendix 3): pressure requirements; materials incompatibility; equipment maintainability; chemical containment; and provisions for exhaust ventilation (see Section 22).23.5 During equipment development, the suppliershould conduct an assessment that documentsconformance to the following airborne chemical controlcriteria (see also Appendix 2). All measurements shouldbe taken using recognized methods with documentedsensitivities and accuracy. A report documenting thesurvey methods, equipment operating parameters,instrumentation used, calibration data, results, anddiscussion should be available.23.5.1 There should be no chemical emissions to theworkplace environment during normal equipmentoperation. Conformance to this section can be shown bydemonstrating ambient air concentrations to be lessthan 1% of the Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL) inthe worst-case personnel breathing zone. Where arecognized method does not provide sufficientsensitivity to measure 1% OEL, then the lowerdetection limit of the method may be used to satisfy thiscriterion.23.5.2 Chemical emissions during maintenanceactivities should be minimized. Conformance to this

&lt;!-- Page 49 --&gt;

SEMI S2-0703aE © SEMI 1991, 2004 28 section can be shown by demonstrating ambient airconcentrations to be less than 25% of the OEL, in theanticipated worst-case personnel breathing zone, duringmaintenance activities.23.5.3 Chemical emissions during equipment failuresshould be minimized. Conformance to this section canbe shown by demonstrating ambient air concentrationsto be less than 25% of the OEL, in the anticipatedworst-case personnel breathing zone, during a realisticworst-case system failure.NOTE 111: The use of direct reading instrumentation undersimulated operating, maintenance, or failure conditions is thepreferred measurement method. Where used, it isrecommended that the sample location(s) be representative ofthe worst-case, realistic exposure locations(s). It isrecommended that the peak concentration be directlycompared to the OEL to demonstrate conformance to Sections23.5.123.5.3.NOTE 112: It is recommended that integrated samplingmethods be used when direct-reading instrumentation doesnot have adequate sensitivity, or when direct-readingtechnology is not available for the chemicals of interest.Where integrated sampling is used, it is recommended that thesample duration and locations(s) be representative of theworst-case, realistic, anticipated exposure time and locations.The resulting average concentration is directly compared tothe OEL to demonstrate conformance to Sections 23.5.123.5.3.NOTE 113: Tracer gas testing (see SEMI F15 for anacceptable method) may be used when direct-readinginstrumentation does not have adequate sensitivity, or whendirect-reading technology is not available for the chemicals ofinterest. Tracer gas testing should be used where testingconditions may be hazardous (e.g., system failure simulationwith potential release of hazardous gas to atmosphere). It isrecommended that tracer gas testing be used only when anaccurate rate of chemical emission can be determined. Whereused, it is recommended that the sample location(s) berepresentative of the worst-case, realistic exposure location(s).23.5.4 Chemical emissions outside the enclosureduring a realistic worst-case system failure should beless than the lower of the following two values: 25% ofthe lower explosive limit (LEL), or 25% of the OEL.23.6 Equipment that uses hazardous gases may requirecontinuous detection and, if so, should have samplepoints mounted in the equipment, or haverecommended sampling points identified in theequipment installation instructions. Where the gassupply is part of or controlled by the equipment, theequipment should be able to accept a signal from anexternal monitoring device and shut down the supply ofthe gas.23.7 Appropriate hazard warning labels should beplaced at all chemical enclosure access openings. 24 Ionizing Radiation24.1 This section covers equipment that producesionizing radiation (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays) or usesradioactive sources.24.2 Accessible emissions of ionizing radiation shouldbe designed as low as reasonably achievable. Thiscriteria can be met by demonstrating conformance tothe provisions in Sections 24.2.1 and 24.2.2 andAppendix 4.24.2.1 Accessible levels of ionizing radiation duringnormal operations should be less than 2 microsieverts(0.2 millirem) per hour above background. See alsoTable A4-1 of Appendix 4.24.2.2 Accessible levels of ionizing radiation duringmaintenance and service procedures should be less than10 microsieverts (1 millirem) per hour abovebackground. See also Table A4-1 of Appendix 4.24.2.3 Access to radioactive contamination or internalexposure (e.g., inhalation, ingestion) to radioactivematerials should be minimized. The hazards andcontrols for the prevention of personnel contaminationand internal exposures should be detailed in theoperation and maintenance manuals.NOTE 114: The use of radioactive material is strictlyregulated around the world. Import, export, and transportationof radioactive materials is also highly regulated. Licenses maybe required to possess, use, and distribute radioactivematerials.NOTE 115: Many regions require both user and importlicenses, and the timely acquisition of these licenses dependson the information provided by the equipment supplier.NOTE 116: Radiation producing machines are also regulatedaround the world. Regulations and licensing requirementsmay cover activities such as importing, exporting, installing,servicing and using radiation producing equipment.24.2.4 The manufacturer should supply, in the userdocumentation, a contact phone number and address forthe manufacturers radiation safety support personnel.24.3 Equipment should be designed to minimize accessor exposure to ionizing radiation during normaloperation, maintenance, and service. Potentialexposures should be controlled in the following order ofpreference:24.3.1 Engineering Controls  Engineering controls(e.g. shielding, interlocks) should be the primarymechanism to minimize emission of ionizing radiationor access to ionizing radiation.24.3.1.1 Radiation shielding for the equipmentfacilities connections (e.g., gas and exhaust lines)should be designed such that removal and replacementof the shielding during installation is minimized.

Areport documenting the survey methods, equipmentoperating parameters, instrumentation used, calibrationdata, source locations, results, and discussion should bemade available.24.5.3 If supplemental administrative controls arerecommended based on survey results or calculations, adiscussion should be provided in the operations andmaintenance manuals describing the source locations,radiation levels, and recommended control measures.NOTE 118: Ionizing radiation sources must be registered orlicensed according to the regulations of the country ofdestination. These radiation sources must conform to theregulations of central or local government agencies,whichever is stricter.NOTE 119: It is recommended that equipment containingradioactive materials should demonstrate conformance tolicensing with local regulatory agencies prior to shipment.NOTE 120: Equipment that uses particle acceleration in itsprocess has the potential for generating ionizing radiation as aresult of nuclear interactions between the accelerated particlesand various materials. These materials can include materialsof construction of the equipment, accumulated residualprocess materials in the equipment, and the target materials. 25 Non-Ionizing Radiation and Fields25.1 This section covers equipment that produces non-ionizing radiation, except laser sources, in the followingcategories:  static electric and magnetic (0 Hz), sub-radio frequency electric and magnetic fields( &lt; 3 kHz), radio frequency (3 kHz300 GHz), infrared radiation (700 nm1 mm), visible Light (400 nm700 nm), and ultraviolet Light (180400 nm).25.2 Potentially hazardous non-ionizing radiationemissions that are accessible to any personnel should belimited to the lowest practical level. This criterion canbe met by demonstrating conformance to the followingprovisions:EXCEPTION: Emissions of non-ionizing radiationexceeding the cardiac pacemaker limits in Appendix 5but less than the levels in Sections 25.2.1 and 25.2.2should be identified with appropriate labeling. See alsoSection 25.5.1.25.2.1 Accessible levels of non-ionizing radiationduring normal operations are less than the Operator-Accessible Limit (see Appendix 5);25.2.2 Accessible levels of non-ionizing radiationduring maintenance and service procedures are lessthan the Maintenance- and Service-Accessible Limit(see Appendix 5).25.3 Sources of potentially hazardous non-ionizingradiation should be identified in the operation andmaintenance manuals, and appropriate parameterslisted. Parameters include frequency, wavelength,power levels, continuous wave or pulsed (see alsoAppendix 5). If pulsed, parameters also include thepulse repetition rate, pulse duration, and description ofthe pulse waveform.EXCEPTION: Visible sources which are intended to beviewed or which provide illumination (e.g., displaypanels, visible alarm indicators), and are not lasers, donot need to be identified.NOTE 121: It is recommended that UV/IR generators thatare part of fire protection test apparatus, and are providedwith the equipment, be considered as possible sources ofpotentially hazardous non-ionizing radiation.25.4 Equipment should be designed to minimize accessor exposure to non-ionizing radiation during normaloperation, maintenance, and service. Potentialexposures should be controlled in the following order ofpreference:25.4.1 engineering controls (e.g., enclosure, shielding,guarding, grounding, interlocks);
