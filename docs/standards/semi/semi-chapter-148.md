magnitude as measured from the baseline.

(second)  beam  empty.    For  FT-IR  and  other  single-

5. 3.7.1  Discussion      ó      For      true      double-beam
instruments,  it  is  obtained  directly  with  the  sample  in
the  sample  beam  and  the  reference  (second)  beam
empty.  For FT-IR and other single-beam instruments, it
is the result of ratioing  the single-beam spectrum of the
sample to the background spectrum (see Section 5.3.1).
6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1  At  room  temperature,  test  slices  are  prepared  that
are polished on both sides to a nominal thickness of 2.0
mm.    At  cryogenic  temperatures,  the  thickness  of  the
test slices can range from 2.0 to 4.0 mm.
6. 2 A reference slice of known low carbon content (see
Section 3.2) is prepared in the same manner.
6. 3 After verifying that the instrument is suitably set up,
transmittance  spectra  of  the  sample  and  reference  are
obtained  over  the  range  from  700  to  500  cm
−1
(14.3  to
20. 0 μm)  on  a  double-beam  dispersive  or  single-beam
Fourier  Transform  Infrared  (FT-IR)  spectrophotometer
in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
6. 4    Absorbance    spectra    are    derived    from    these
transmittance  spectra  and  a  carbon-only  spectrum  is
obtained  as  the  difference  between  the  two  absorbance
spectra.
6. 5  A  baseline  is  drawn  between  the  regions  on  both
sides  of  the  carbon  peak  on  this  difference  absorbance
spectrum,  and  absorbance  values  of  both  the  peak  and
baseline are recorded.
6. 6   The   absorbance   peak   height   is   taken   as   the
difference between these two values.  This peak height,
corrected   for   sample   thickness,   is   multiplied   by   a
constant  to  calculate  the  substitutional  carbon  concen-
tration.  Two constants are used, one for measurements
at  room  temperature  (300  K),  and  one  for  measure-
ments at cryogenic temperatures (below 80 K).
7  Apparatus
7. 1 Infrared  Spectrophotometer  ó  Either  a  dispersive
(computerized or non-computerized) or a Fourier trans-
form  (FT-IR)  spectrophotometer  may  be  used.    The
resolution  of  the  spectrophotometer  must  be  at  least  2
cm
−1
at  room  temperature,  or  1  cm
−1
at  cryogenic
temperatures,  over  the  range  from  500  to  700  cm
−1
for
either dispersive or Fourier  transform infrared spectro-
photometers.      The   total   operating   range   of   the
spectrophotometer  shall  include  the  range  from  500  to
2000 cm
−1
.
7. 2 Micrometer Caliper ó or other instrument, capable
of  measuring  the  thickness  of  the  specimens  to  an
accuracy of 0.005 mm.
7. 3 Equipment  and  Materials  for  Slicing  and  Polishing
Silicon — to a final thickness tolerance of 0.005 mm or
less, and a total thickness variation of 0.01 mm or less.
7. 4 Thermometer  ó  or  other  instrument  capable  of
measuring  the  temperature  of  the  sample  chamber  (for
room  temperature  measurements)  or  the  sample  holder
(for      cryogenic      temperature      [below      80      K]
measurements) to within ± 2∞C.
7. 5 Calcium  Fluoride  Crystal  (CaF
2
),  cut  to  nominal
thickness of 5 mm.
8  Sampling
8. 1  Unless  otherwise  specified,  a  silicon  slice  used  for
the  carbon  test  is  to  be  measured  at  the  nominal  slice
center.
9  Test and Reference Specimens
9. 1 A single crystal slice of about 2-mm thickness must
be  used  at  room  temperature,  and  a  slice  of  2.4  to  3.5-
mm thickness is preferable at cryogenic temperatures.
9. 2  Both  the  test  and  reference  specimens  must  be
carefully shaped to the following criteria:
9. 2.1    Thickness  variation  over  the  measurement  area
shall be 0.005 mm or less.
9. 2.2  Surface preparation shall be identical,
9. 2.3        Thickness    equality    shall    meet    one    of    the
following:
9. 2.3.1    When  the  measurement  is  made  with  double
beam  simple  dispersive  infrared  spectrophotometers,
the  final  thickness  of  test  and  reference  slices  shall  be
equal to within ± 0.01 mm (see Section 10.4).
9. 2.3.2  When the measurement is made with computer
assisted  double-beam  dispersive  or  single-beam  FT-IR
spectrophotometers,   the   final   thickness   of   test   and


SEMI MF1391-0704 © 2004

4
reference slices shall be equal to within ± 0.5 mm (see
Section 10.5).
9. 2.4    Surface  area  large  enough  such  that  with  respect
to  the  holders  no  incident  radiation  can  bypass  either
the test or reference specimen.
9. 3 The reference specimen must be selected from float
zone   silicon   with   a   minimal   substitutional   carbon
concentration and a carrier concentration such that there
is  no  measurable  free  carrier  absorption  of  infrared
radiation in the range from 500 to 2000 cm
−1
.
NOTE 1:  A satisfactory method of selecting usable reference
specimens  is  to  prepare  polished  slices  of  equal  thickness
from  many  different  low-carbon  silicon  crystals  produced  by
the float zone method, and then compare them to each other in
an  infrared  radiation  (IR)  spectrophotometer.    The  selection
must  be  carried  out  at  cryogenic  temperatures  for  cryogenic
measurements.  The specimen(s) showing the highest relative
transmittance  at  605  cm
−1
at  room  temperature,  or  at  607.5
cm
−1
at cryogenic temperatures (below 80 K), can be used as
reference specimen(s).
9. 4   Both   test   and   reference   specimens   must   have
resistivity  greater  than  3  Ω∑cm  for  p-type  silicon  and
greater than 1 Ω∑cm for n-type silicon.
10  Procedure
10. 1 Instrumental Checks
10. 1.1    With  reference  to  the  transmittance  spectrum,
establish  the  100%  transmittance  line  to  measure  the
stability  and  the  noise  level  by  one  of  the  following
methods.
10. 1.1.1  For   double-beam   instruments,   record   the
transmittance   spectrum   with   both   the   sample   and
reference beams empty.
10. 1.1.2  For single-beam instruments, record the trans-
mittance spectrum as the ratio of two spectra taken with
the sample beam empty.  Take the two spectra at times
separated by at least the time required  to load samples
and take two sequential spectra.
10. 1.1.3  In both cases, plot the transmittance spectrum
over  the  wavenumber  range  covering  500  to  700  cm
−1

to obtain the 100% line.
10. 1.1.4    If  the  100%  transmittance  line  is  100  ±  0.5%
over   the   entire   range,   continue   to   the   next   step.
Otherwise, adjust or repair the instrument so as to meet
this criterion.
10. 1.2  Establish the 0% transmittance line, (T).
10. 1.2.1                For        double-beam        dispersive        (DIR)
instruments, record the transmittance spectrum between
700 and 500 cm
−1
with the sample beam blocked.
10. 1.2.2    For  FT-IR  instruments,  collect  a  background
spectrum   with   the   beam   empty.      Next,   collect   a
spectrum with a CaF
2
crystal wafer, 5-mm thick, in the
beam.  Obtain the spectrum that is the ratio of the CaF
2

spectrum  to  the  background  spectrum,  and  plot  the
percent  transmittance  spectrum  between  700  and  500
cm
−1
.
10. 1.2.3    In  either  of  these  cases,  the  0%  transmittance
must  not  exceed  ±  0.5%  over  the  range  between  700
and 500 cm
−1
.
10. 1.2.4    Alternatively,  for  FT-IR  instruments,  plot  the
single-beam  background  spectrum  (empty  beam  only)
from  1000  to  200  cm
−1
.    The  recorded  energy  in  a
region  where  the  detector  is  known    to  give  a  zero
response (below 300 cm
−1
for most detectors) must not
be  greater  than  1.0%  of  the  maximum  signal  in  this
region.

10. 1.3      To   determine   the   mid-scale   linearity   of   the
instrument  obtain  a  spectrum  of  the  silicon  reference
specimen  over  the  wavenumber  range  from  1600  to
2000 cm
−1
.  If the value of the transmittance is not 53.8
± 2% over this wavenumber range, align the sample at a
small  angle  to  the  axis  of  the  incoming  IR  beam,  in
order  to  minimize  undesirable  reflections  between  the
silicon surfaces and the spectrometer components.
NOTE  2:    This  angle  may  be  determined  by  initially  placing
the silicon slice normal to the axis of the incoming beam, and
then gradually tilting the specimen while repeatedly obtaining
the  transmittance  spectrum  above  1600  cm
−1
.    The  optimum
angle is typically less than 10∞.
10. 2 Measure and record the thicknesses of the test and
reference  specimens  to  within  ±  0.005  mm,  at  their
centers.
10. 3 For room temperature measurements, measure and
record the temperature of the sample chamber to ± 2∞C.
At  cryogenic  temperatures  (below  80  K),  measure  and
record the temperature of the sample holder.
10. 4  Obtain  the  carbon-only  absorbance  spectrum  by
one of the following methods (see Figure 1):


4  Chase, D. B., Applied Spectroscopy 38(4), 491ñ494 (1984).

Figure 1
Carbon-Only Absorbance Spectrum

10. 4.1        For    double-beam    instruments,    position    the
sample specimen in the sample beam and the reference
specimen in the reference beam and collect and plot the
carbon-only  absorbance  spectrum  over  the  range  of  at
least  700  to  500  cm
−1
.    Use  a  resolution  of  2  cm
−1
or
better,   at   605   cm
−1
,   at   room   temperature,   and   a
resolution  of  1  cm
−1
or  better,  at  607.5  cm
−1
,  at  cryo-
genic temperatures (below 80 K).  Take spectra with the
sample  chamber  in  a  vacuum,  dry  nitrogen,  or  dry  air.
Position  the  specimen  so  that  the  infrared  beam  passes
through the center of the specimens.
10. 4.2                      For           single-beam           (computer-assisted)
instruments,  first  collect  a  background  spectrum  with
the  beam  empty,  then  collect  sample  and  reference
spectra sequentially under the same conditions as given
in  Section  10.4.5.    Ratio  the  sample  and  reference
spectra  to  the  background  and  convert  to  absorbance.
Multiply the reference absorbance spectrum by the ratio
of the test specimen thickness to the reference specimen
thickness and subtract this normalized absorbance from
the test specimen absorbance to obtain the carbon-only
spectrum.
NOTE  3:    If  the  user  has  interactive  arithmetic  capability,
subtract  the  reference  absorbance  spectrum  from  the  sample
absorbance spectrum in a ratio that provides  the best flatness
of  the  non-peak  baseline  between  560  and  640  cm
−1
.  This
eliminates  the  2-phonon  band  due  to  silicon  and  gives  a
carbon-only spectrum.
10. 5   With   regard   to   the   plot   of   the   carbon-only
absorbance  spectrum  over  the  range  from  500  to  700
cm
−1
,  define  the  baseline  by  drawing  a  straight  line
from  560  to  640  cm
−1
.    Use  the  average  in  the  regions
from  550  to  570  cm
−1
,  and  630  to  650  cm
−1
,  to  define
the endpoints of the straight line.

10. 6 For measurements at room temperature, locate the
wavenumber      corresponding      to      the      maximum
absorbance  in  the  region  from  603  to  607  cm
−1
.    For
measurements at cryogenic temperatures (below 80 K),
locate the wavenumber corresponding to the maximum
absorbance in the region from 605 to 609 cm
−1
.
10. 6.1    Record  the  value  of  that  wavenumber,  to  four
significant   figures,   as   W
p
.      Record   the   maximum
absorbance  as  A
p
,  the  absorbance  of  the  absorption
peak.
10. 6.2    Record  the  baseline  absorbances,  A
b
,  as  the
value of the baseline defined in 10.5 at W
p
.
10. 6.3  Record   both A
p
and   A
b
to   three   significant
figures.
10. 7   Determine   and   record   the   full   width   at   half
maximum  (FWHM)  of  the  peak.  If the FWHM of the
peak  is  greater  than  6  cm
−1
(room  temperature)  or  3
cm
−1
(cryogenic  temperatures),  the  spectrum  was  not
properly  obtained,  and  the  instrument  needs  further
adjustment,   or   the   specimen   is   under   stress.      See
Section  3.4  for  a  list  of  factors  that  influence  FWHM.
Adjust  the  instrument  in  order  to  achieve  the  proper
FWHM and repeat the procedure.
10. 8 Record the apodization function and the number of
zero-fills  used  (FT-IR  instruments)  or  the  spectral  slit
width for dispersive  infrared (DIR) instruments.

NOTE 5:  The  calibration  factor used  in  this  test  method  was
determined  as  result  of  a  study  carried  out  in  Japan  by  the
Silicon  Technologies  Committee  of  the  Japanese  Electronic
Industries Development Association (JEIDA), now JEITA,

in
the mid-1980ís.  Further data analysis to eliminate recognized
systematic  error  was  carried  out  by  the  ASTM  subcommittee
assigned  for  this  effort.    The  factor  resulting  from  this  study
has   an   uncertainty   of   ±   0.4   ◊   10

13  Precision
13. 1  A  round  robin  was  carried  out  by  JEIDA  (now
JEITA
1
).    The  results  of  this  21-laboratory  study  are
shown  in  Table  1.    Figure  2  shows  that  the  sample
standard deviation increases with concentration value.
13. 2  A  single-laboratory  investigation  of  the  precision
of carbon measurement at cryogenic temperature with a
Fourier   transform   spectrophotometer   was   conducted
using  a  single  sample  analyzed  once  a  day  over  a  30-
day period (30 measurement values).  From this single-
laboratory,    multiple-operator,    multiple-day,    single-
sample     investigation     of     precision     of     carbon
measurement, the precision was found to be 0.02 ppma
(2 standard deviations).  Nominal carbon content of the
sample was 0.16 ppma.
14  Bias
14. 1  The  bias  of  this  test  method  cannot  be  evaluated
because   there   are   no   available   reference   standards
suitable for evaluating bias.

TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING NET CARRIER DENSITY
PROFILES IN SILICON WAFERS BY CAPACITANCE-VOLTAGE
MEASUREMENTS WITH A MERCURY PROBE
This   standard   was   technically   approved   by   the   Global   Silicon   Wafer   Committee   and   is   the   direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the  North  American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  July  12,  2003.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org
October  2003;  to  be  published  November  2003.    Originally  published  by  ASTM  International  as  ASTM
F 1392-92.  Last previous edition ASTM F 1392-02.
1  Purpose
1. 1  Net carrier density is a critical parameter in growth
of epitaxial layers of silicon.  This test method provides
a  means  for  determining  net  carrier  density  without
formation  of  a  special  diode  structure  on  the  layer.    It
may also be used in characterizing net carrier density in
polished silicon wafers.
1. 2    This  test  method  can  be  used  for  research  and
development,  process  control,  and  materials  specifi-
cation, evaluation, and acceptance purposes.
1. 3      In   the   absence   of   interlaboratory   test   data   to
establish  its  reproducibility  (see  Section  14.2),  this  test
method  should  be  used  for  materials  specification  and
acceptance   only   after   the   parties   to   the   test   have
established reproducibility and correlation.
2  Scope
2. 1    This  test  method
1
covers  the  measurement  of  net
carrier   density   and   net   carrier   density   profiles   in
epitaxial  and  polished  bulk  silicon  wafers  in  the  range
from   about   4   ×   10
13
to  about  8  ×  10

(resistivity  range  from  about  0.1  to  about  100  Ω·cm  in
n-type  wafers  and  from  about  0.24  to  about  330  Ω·cm
in p-type wafers).
2. 2      This   test   method   requires   the   formation   of   a
Schottky barrier diode with a mercury probe contact to
an   epitaxial   or   polished   wafer   surface.      Chemical
treatment  of  the  silicon  surface  may  be  required  to
produce a reliable Schottky barrier diode.
2
The surface
treatment  chemistries  are  different  for  n-  and  p-type
wafers.    This  test  method  is  sometimes  considered
destructive due to the possibility of contamination from


1  DIN 50439, Determination of the Dopant Concentration Profile of
a    Single    Crystal    Semiconductor    Material    by    Means    of    the
Capacitance-Voltage  Method  and  Mercury  Contact,  is  technically
equivalent  to  this  test  method.    DIN  50439  is  the  responsibility  of
DIN Committee NMP 221, with which SEMI maintains close liaison.

GmbH, Burggrafenstraße 4-10, D-10772, Berlin, Germany.

the  Schottky  contact  formed  on  the  wafer  surface;
however,  repetitive  measurements  may  be  made  on  the
same test specimen.
2. 3  This test method may be applied to epitaxial layers
on  the  same  or  opposite  conductivity  type  substrate.
This  test  method  includes  descriptions  of  fixtures  for
measuring   substrates   with   or   without   an   insulating
backseal layer.
2. 4      The   depth   of   the   region   that   can   be   profiled
depends  on  the  doping  level  in  the  test  specimen.
Based on data reported by Severin

and Grove,

Figure
1  shows  the  relationships  between  depletion  depth,
dopant  density,  and  applied  voltage  together  with  the
breakdown  voltage  of  a  mercury  silicon  contact.    The
test  specimen  can  be  profiled  from  approximately  the
depletion  depth  corresponding  to  an  applied  voltage  of
1   V   to   the   depletion   depth   corresponding   to   the
maximum  applied  voltage  (200  V  or  about  80%  of  the
breakdown   voltage,   whichever   is   lower).      To   be
measured  by  this  test  method,  a  layer  must  be  thicker
than  the  depletion  depth  corresponding  to  an  applied
voltage of 2 V.
2. 5      This   test   method   is   intended   for   rapid   carrier
density     determination     when     extended     sample
preparation  time  or  high  temperature  processing  of  the
wafer is not practical.
2. 6      This   test   method   provides   for   determining   the
effective   area   of   the   mercury   probe   contact   using
polished bulk reference wafers that have been measured
for  resistivity  at  23°C  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF84
(see Note 1).  This test method also includes procedures
for  calibration  of  the  apparatus  for  measuring  both
capacitance and voltage.
NOTE  1:    An  alternative  method  of  determining  the  effective
area  of  the  mercury  probe  contact  that  involves  the  use  of
reference wafers whose net carrier density has been measured
using   fabricated   mesa   or   planar   p-n junction   diodes   or
evaporated Schottky diodes is not included in this test method
but may be used if agreed upon by the parties to the test.

2. 7        Warnings    and    precautionary    notes    regarding
potential  safety  hazards  are  provided  throughout  the
document.
NOTICE: This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1      A   poor   Schottky   contact,   which   is   generally
indicated  by  an  excessively  high  leakage  current  (see
Section   11.5)   is   the   most      common   problem   in
capacitance-voltage  measurements  made  with  mercury
probe  instruments.    It  must  be  emphasized  that  the  use
of  a  poor  Schottky  contact  does  not  actually  prevent  a
carrier    density    determination    but    produces    an
erroneous result.
3. 2        Improper    determination    of    the    compensation
capacitance, C
comp
,   (see   Section   10.3)   can   cause
significant  errors  in  the  capacitance  measurement.    In
homogeneous  material,  improper  zeroing    or  use  of  an
improper   value   for   C
comp
results   in   an   apparent
monotonic  increase  or  decrease  of  carrier  density  with
distance  from  the  Schottky  barrier.    In  some  fixtures,
inherently  large  stray  capacitances  exist;  in  such  cases,
the value of C
comp
may depend both on the diameter of
the wafer and on the position of the wafer on the chuck.
If   these   dependencies   are   observed,   they   may   be
reduced  or  eliminated  by  shielding  the  mercury  probe
column.    If  shielding  is  not  practical,  probe  calibration
procedures  should  be  carried  out  with  wafers  of  the
same  diameter  as  the  wafers  being  tested  and  care
should  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  geometry  of  wafer
and    probe    is    the    same    during    calibration    and
measurement.
3. 3  Alternating frequency test signals greater than 0.05
V rms may lead to errors in the measured capacitance.
3. 4      Excessive   series   resistance   in   the   capacitance
measurement  circuit  can  cause  significant  errors  in  the
measured  capacitance  values.    Series  resistance  values
greater   than   1   kΩ   have   been   reported      to   cause
measurement   error   in   some   cases.
4,5
The   primary
source of excessive series resistance is generally a high-
resistance  return  contact;  other  possible  sources  are
bulk  resistance  in  the  wafer  and  wiring  defects  in  the


4    Wiley,  J.  D.,  and  Miller,  G.  L.,  “Series  Resistance  Effects  in
Semiconductor CV Profiling,”  IEEE Trans. Electron Devices ED-22,
265–272 (1975).

2. 5.2.
mercury  probe  fixture  or  the  test  cables  (see  Section
11. 4).
3. 5    When  exposed  to  air,  a  scum  tends  to  form  on  the
exposed   surface   of   the   mercury   used   to   form   the
mercury  probe  contact.    When  freed  from  the  surface,
this scum floats to the top of the mercury column.  It is
necessary to make certain that the mercury that contacts
the  wafer  surface  is  clean  by  changing  the  mercury
periodically  or  by  otherwise  removing  the  scum  from
the exposed surface.
3. 6    A  dirty  or  damaged  capillary  tube  containing  the
mercury    column    may    also    result    in    unstable
measurements (see Section 10.4.2.2).
3. 7    If  the  reference  wafer  is  not  sufficiently  uniform
throughout its thickness, the value of net carrier density,
N
ref
,  determined  by  the  four-point  probe  measurement
(see  Section  8.4.3)  may  differ  from  the  value  of  net
carrier  density  at  the  surface  where  the  mercury  probe
measurement  is  made.    Use  of  erroneous  values  of  N
ref

results  in  incorrect  values  for  effective  probe  contact
area (see Section 10.3).  Further, if the resistivity profile
of  the  reference  wafer  is  not  uniform  near  the  surface,
an   incorrect   value   of   C
comp
may   be   obtained   (see
Section  10.2).    Incorrect  values  of  probe  contact  area
and C
comp
result  in  incorrect  values  for  the  average  net
carrier density of the test specimen.

6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1        The    compensation    capacitance    and    effective
mercury  probe  contact  area  are  determined  using  a
reference wafer.
6. 2    The  test  specimen  is  placed  in  the  mercury  probe
fixture.    A  column  of  mercury  is  brought  into  contact
with  the  epitaxial  or  polished  surface  of  the  specimen
by  a  pressure  differential  between  the  mercury  and
ambient  to  form  a  Schottky  barrier  diode  (mercury
probe contact).
6. 3    A  low-resistance  return  contact  is  also  made  to
either  the  front  or  back  surface  of  the  wafer.    This
contact   may   be   either   a   metal   plate   or   a   second
mercury-silicon  contact  with  an  area  much  larger  than
the mercury probe contact.
6. 4  The quality of the Schottky barrier diode formed by
the mercury probe contact is evaluated by measuring its
series resistance and its reverse current characteristics.
6. 5  The small-signal, high frequency capacitance of the
mercury probe contact is measured as a function of the
voltage applied between the mercury probe column and
the  return  contact.    The  polarity  of  the  applied  voltage
is such that the mercury probe contact is reverse biased
and the low-resistance return contact is forward biased.
6. 6    The  net  carrier  density  profile  (net  carrier  density
as  a  function  of  depth  from  the  surface)  is  calculated
from  the  measured  values  of  capacitance  and  applied
voltage by one of two equivalent methods.
NOTE  2:    Net  carrier  density  values  obtained  by  this  test
method are often converted to resistivity, which is generally a
more  familiar  parameter  in  the  industry.    If  this  is  done,  the
conversion    should    be    made    in    accordance    with    the
computational methods given in Section 7.2 of SEMI MF723.
Note  that  in  applying  this  conversion  procedure  in  either
direction  it  is  assumed  that  the  net  carrier  density  is  equal  to
the dopant density.
7  Apparatus
7. 1  Mercury  Probe  Fixture  —  One  of  the  following
fixtures  depending  on  the  type  of  test  specimen  to  be
measured.    Warning:  Mercury  is  a  toxic  material.
Refer  to  the  appropriate  Material  Safety  Data  Sheet
prior to use.  Avoid physical contact with mercury and
breathing of its vapor.
7. 1.1  Back-Surface-Return-Contact  Fixture,  for  use  in
measuring polished wafers or epitaxial layers deposited
on  substrates  of  the  same  conductivity  type.    A  probe
fixture  that  holds  the  treated  wafer  and  provides  a
single  mercury  column  contained  in  a  capillary  tube
with  nominal  inside  diameter  of  0.4  to  2.0  mm.    The
fixture  shall  be  capable  of  forming  a  mercury  probe
contact area on the front polished or epitaxial surface of


SEMI MF1392-1103 © SEMI 2003 5
the  wafer  with  a  repeatability  of  ±1%  or  better.    The
fixture   must   also   provide   a   low-resistance   return
contact to the back surface of the wafer.
7. 1.2  Front-Surface-Return-Contact  Fixture, for use in
measuring  epitaxial  wafers  deposited  on  substrates  of
the  opposite  conductivity  type  or  on  substrates  with
insulating  back  surface  films.    A  probe  fixture  that
holds the treated wafer and provides two contacts to the
front  polished  or  epitaxial  surface  of  the  wafer.    One
contact  is  the  mercury  probe  contact  as  described  in
7. 1.1,  and  the  other  is  a  low-resistance  return  contact.
The latter may be either a second mercury column or a
metal plate.  Its area shall be such that its capacitance is
not  less  than  32  times  the  capacitance  of  the  smaller
mercury  column.    In  addition,  it  is  recommended  that
this fixture also provide a low-resistance  return contact
to the back surface of the wafer to permit the apparatus
also   to   be   used   in   the   back-surface-return-contact
configuration (see Section 7.1.1).
7. 2  Equipment  for  Handling  Mercury  —  Hypodermic
needle  or  other  means  for  transferring  mercury  from  a
storage bottle to the mercury column and equipment for
neutralizing     and     picking     up     spilled     mercury
(Warning—see Section 7.1).
7. 3  Capacitance  Bridge  or  Meter,  with  ranges  from  1
to 1000 pF full scale or greater, in range multiples of 10
or  less.    The  accuracy  shall  be  1.0%  of  full  scale  or
better for each range, and the rated reproducibility shall
be  0.25%  of  full  scale  or  better.    The  internal  a-c
voltage  signal  shall  not  exceed  0.05  V  rms.    The
measurement  frequency  shall  be  in  the  range  from  0.9
to 1.1 MHz inclusive.  The instrument shall be capable
of  sustaining  an  external  d-c  bias  of  up  to  200  V.
Provision shall be made to compensate a compensation
capacitance of up to 10 pF.
NOTE    3:        Capacitance    meters    or    bridges    capable    of
measuring   the   phase   angle,   equivalent   series   resistance,
conductance or total impedance in addition to the capacitance
may be used.
NOTE 4:  Capacitance  meters with  nominal  frequencies  from
100  kHz  to  1  MHz  have  been  used  for  measurements  of  the
type  covered  by  this  test  method.    If  an  instrument  with  a
nominal  frequency  other  than  1  MHz  is  employed,  the  user
shall  demonstrate  that  it  obtains  results  equivalent  to  the
specified instrument.
7. 4  DC Power Supply, continuously variable from 0 V
to   the   maximum   expected   reverse   bias   or   200   V,
whichever  is  less,  capable  of  supplying  voltages    of
either  polarity  with  a  peak-to-peak  noise  of  25  mV  or
less.    This  power  supply  may  be  integrated  with  the
capacitance meter, if desired.
NOTE 5:  The  maximum  reverse  bias  depends  on  the  net
carrier density in the wafer under test, see Figure 1.
7. 5  Digital  Voltmeter,  with  a  minimum  of  four  digits,
ranges from ±1 to ±200 V full scale or greater in range
multiples  of  10  or  less,  a  sensitivity  of  1  mV  or  less,
and  an  accuracy  of  0.5%  of  full  scale  or  better,  a  rated
reproducibility of 0.25% of full scale or better, an input
impedance  of  100  MΩ  or  more,  and  a  common-mode
rejection  ratio  of  100  dB  or  greater  at  60  Hz.    This
voltmeter may be integrated with the capacitance meter
and power supply, if desired.
7. 6  Curve   Tracer,   or   other   apparatus,   capable   of
monitoring   the   reverse   and   forward   current-voltage
characteristics of the mercury probe contact.  It shall be
capable  of  applying  200  V  at  0.1  mA  in  the  reverse
direction  and  1.1  V  at  1  mA  in  the  forward  direction
and have a sensitivity of 10 μA/division or better.
7. 7  Shielded  Cables,  as  required,  for  making  electrical
connections  between  the  probe  fixture,  power  supply,
capacitance bridge or meter, and digital voltmeter.
7. 8  Precision  Capacitors,  with  an  accuracy  of  0.25%
or   better   at   1   MHz,   the   measurement   frequency,
required  only  for  capacitance  meter  adjustment  and
verification  (see  Section  10.5).    If  used,  at  least  two
precision  capacitors  with  values  differing  by  at  least  a
factor  of  10  and  lying  within  the  expected  capacitance
ranges to be measured are required.
7. 9  Precision  Voltage  Source,  capable  of  providing
output  voltages  from  0  to  ±200  V  with  an  accuracy  of
0. 1%  of  the  output  voltage  or  better,  required  only  for
voltmeter verification (see Section 10.6).
7. 10  Facilities for Wafer Surface Treatment, if required
(see Sections 8.5, 10.3.5, 10.4.3.1, and 11.5.6):
7. 10.1  Fume   Hood,   equipped   with   tanks   to   hold
hydrofluoric  acid  at  room  temperature  and,  for  n-type
wafers  only,  hydrogen  peroxide  at  70°  to  90°C.    The
tanks  shall  be  of  sufficient  size  to  allow  complete
immersion  of  the  cassettes  holding  the  desired  size
wafers.
7. 10.2  Cassettes, for holding the wafers in hydrofluoric
acid.
7. 10.3  Additional  Cassettes,  for  holding  n-type  wafers
in  hydrogen  peroxide  at  70°C.    Warning:  When  using
a cassette that has been previously used in hydrofluoric
acid in hydrogen peroxide without prior cleaning make
sure  that  the  cassette  is  clean  because  of  the  likelihood
of contamination of the hydrogen peroxide bath.
NOTE   6:      A   cassette   that   has   been   previously   used   in
hydrofluoric  acid  may  be  cleaned  for  the  hydrogen  peroxide
treatment by boiling in water for 1 h.
7. 10.4  Dump Rinser, with air atmosphere.

7. 10.5  Spin  Dryer,  for  drying  the  wafers  in  an  air
atmosphere.
7. 10.6  Hot  Plate,  for  p-type wafers or other means for
baking  the  wafer  at  120  ±  10°C  in  air  may  also  be
required.
7. 10.7  Interval Time, for controlling treatment times.
7. 10.8  Nonmetallic  Tweezers  or  Vacuum  Wand,  for
holding and manipulating wafers.
8  Reagents and Materials
8. 1  Purity of Reagents — All chemicals for which such
specifications   exist   shall   adhere   to   Grade   1   SEMI
specifications   for   those   specific   chemicals.      Other
grades may be used, provided it is first determined that
the  chemical  is  of  sufficiently  high  purity  to  permit  its
use without lessening the accuracy of the test.
8. 2  Mercury  shall  be  triple  distilled  and  conform  to
reagent  grade,  as  specified  in  Reagent  Chemicals.
8
It
shall be changed regularly or otherwise maintained in a
clean state to avoid interference from surface scum (see
Section 3.5) (Warning—see Section 7.1).
8. 3  Purity  of  Water  —  Reference  to  water  shall  be
understood   to   mean   Type   E-3   or   better   water   as
described in ASTM Guide D 5127.
8. 4  Reference  Wafers  —  One  or  more  polished  bulk
silicon wafers of the same conductivity type as the layer
or wafer to  be tested.  If one reference wafer is used, its
net  carrier  density  shall  lie  between  one-half  and  two
times the net carrier density of the layer or wafer to be
tested.    If  several  reference  wafers  are  used,  their  net
carrier  densities  shall  cover  the  range  of  net  carrier
densities  of  the  layers  or  wafers  to  be  tested.    Bulk
reference      wafers      shall      have      the      following
characteristics:
8. 4.1    Flat  spreading  resistance  profile  over  a  depth
equal  to  or  greater  than  that  to  be  profiled  in  this  test
method.    The  flat  profile  is  required  to  ensure  correct
determination  of  C
comp
(see  Section  3.7,  Section  10.2).
Determine that the spreading resistance profile is flat in
the following manner:
8. 4.1.1      Measure   the   spreading   resistance   profile   in
accordance  with  SEMI  MF672  on  a  small  chip  from  a
portion  of  the  wafer.    Use  a  minimum  of  10  spreading
resistance    values    in    constructing    the    spreading
resistance profile.
8. 4.1.2    Fit  the  spreading  resistance  data  to  a  straight
line by a least-squares method.


8    “Reagent  Chemicals,  American  Chemical  Society  Specifications,”
Am. Chemical Soc., Washington, DC.
8. 4.1.3    For  the  profile  to  be  considered  flat,  the  fitted
values  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  profile  shall  be
equal  to  within  ±  2%  and  the  maximum  deviation  of
any measured value from the fitted line shall not exceed
5%.
8. 4.2  Resistivity variation over the central region of the
wafer ≤  5%.    Resistivity  variation  over  this  region
should  be  as  small  as  possible  to  obtain  maximum
accuracy of the determination of the net carrier density
of the reference wafer; accurate determination of the net
carrier density is required for accurate determination of
the probe contact area (see Section 10.3).
8. 4.2.1      Determine   radial   unformity   from   resistivity
measurements  taken  at  2.0  mm  intervals  along  two
perpendicular  diameters  for  a  distance  of  6  mm  from
the  center  of  the  wafer  in  each  direction.    Analyze  the
data   in   accordance   with   the   maximum/minimum
convention of Sample Plan D of SEMI MF81.
8. 4.2.2    Establish  axial  uniformity  (see  Section  3.7)  by
spreading  resistance  measurements  across  a  cleaved
portion  of  the  wafer  or  by  some  other  method  agreed
upon by the parties to the test.
8. 4.3  Known Net Carrier Density — Determine the net
carrier density as follows:
8. 4.3.1  Measure  the  resistivity  at  the  center  of  the
wafer  and  correct  it  to  23°C  in  accordance  with  SEMI
MF84.
8. 4.3.2      Convert   the   resistivity   value   to   net   carrier
density   using   the   computational   methods   given   in
Section 7.2 of SEMI MF723.
NOTE  7:    In  applying  this  conversion  procedure  in  either
direction  it  is  assumed  that  the  net  carrier  density  is  equal  to
the  dopant  density.    The  appropriate  equation  given  in  this
section  for  resistivity  must  be  solved  iteratively  for  the  net
carrier  density.    It  is  necessary  to  use  the  same  equation  for
conversion  from  net  carrier  density  to  resistivity  and  vice
versa in order to eliminate the self-consistency errors in SEMI
MF723.    The  choice  of  conversion  direction  in  this  test
method   was   made   so   that   the   more   laborious,   iterative
procedure is applied to the less frequently measured reference
wafers  and  the  direct  conversion  procedure  is  applied  to
material being evaluated by this test method.
8. 4.3.3    Record  the  net  carrier  density  just  obtained,  as
N
ref
, in cm
−3
.
NOTE  8:    The  advantage  of  using  bulk  reference  wafers  is
that the net carrier density can be related to that of resistivity
standard  reference  materials  issued  by  the  National  Institute
of    Standards    and    Technology.        However,    material
inhomogeneity may make it difficult to obtain accurate values
of net carrier density from bulk reference wafers (see Section
3. 7).    As  an  alternative,  epitaxial  wafers  may  be  used  as
reference  wafers.    In  this  case,  the  epitaxial  layer  thickness
should be large enough that the resistivity profile in the near-


SEMI MF1392-1103 © SEMI 2003 7
surface  region  may  be  obtained  from  spreading  resistance
measurements  through  the  use  of  a  calibration  curve  only,
without  the  need  for  using  correction  factors.    Since  the
procedures  for  characterizing  such  reference  wafers  have  not
been   standardized,   epitaxial   wafers   should   be   used   as
reference  wafers  only  if  agreed  upon  between  the  parties  to
the test.  If used, the epitaxial reference wafer should meet the
requirements  of  Section  8.41  for  a  flat  spreading  resistance
profile.    Net  carrier  density  should  be  determined  using  an
metal  oxide  silicon  (MOS)  capacitor  structure  in  accordance
with   SEMI   MF1153   or   by   another   mutually   acceptable
method.
8. 5  Reagents   for   Surface   Treatment   —   If   surface
treatment  is  required,  the  following  chemicals  may  be
needed.    Grade  1  chemicals  are  preferred  (see  Related
Information 1).
8. 5.1  Hydrofluoric  Acid,  HF,  concentrated,  49.00  ±
0. 25%,  in  accordance  with  grade  1  of  SEMI  C28  or
dilute, 4.9 ± 0.1%, in accordance with grade 1 of SEMI
C29.
8. 5.1.1    Once  a  week,  fill  the  hydrofluoric  acid  tank
with fresh HF, either concentrated or dilute.
8. 5.2  Hydrogen  Peroxide,  H
2
O
2
,  unstabilized,  30%,  in
accordance with grade 1 of SEMI C30.
8. 5.2.1  Every 8 h, fill the hydrogen peroxide tank with
a fresh 15% H
2
O
2
solution by mixing equal volumes of
H
2
O
2
(30%)  and  water.    Wait  until  the  freshly  poured
bath  reaches  70  ±  5°C  before  using  to  treat  wafer
surfaces.
8. 5.2.2    During  use,  approximately  every  2  h  (or  when
the  H
2
O
2
level  falls  below  the  wafers  being  treated),
replenish the tank by adding 30% H
2
O
2
.
9  Sampling
9. 1    It  is  generally  impractical  to  measure  every  wafer
in    a    particular    lot    owing    to    the    potential    for
contamination    from    the    handling    and    chemical
treatments  involved.    A  wafer  sampling  plan  shall
therefore be agreed upon between the parties to the test.
9. 2  Locations on the wafer where measurements are to
be  made  shall  also  be  agreed  upon  between  the  parties
to the test.
10  System Calibration and Control
10. 1  Frequency of Calibration and Control Procedures
10. 1.1  Calibrate the capacitance meter and voltmeter in
accordance  with  manufacturer’s  instructions  on  initial
installation    and    following    hardware    or    software
modifications.  Calibration of the capacitance meter and
voltmeter may be carried out in-house or by a qualified
testing laboratory.
10. 1.2    Determine  the  compensation  capacitance  and
effective  area  of  the  mercury  probe  in  accordance  with
the procedures of this section on initial installation and
after any corrective action has been carried out  to bring
the system back into control.
10. 1.3      Conduct   periodic   tests   and   maintain   control
charts in accordance with the procedures in this section
to  demonstrate  that  the  instruments  are  in  control  and
that the variability is within the requirements of this test
method.
10. 2  Determination   of   Compensation   Capacitance,
C

10. 2.1  Measure a series of capacitance-voltage pairs on
the  reference  wafer  carrier  density  of  1  ×  10
−14
cm
−3
or
less or, if such a reference wafer is not available, on the
reference  wafer  with  the  lowest  value  of  net  carrier
density  (see  Section  8.4)  in  accordance  with  Procedure
(Section  11),  using  either  the  front-  or  back-surface-
return-contact  configuration  depending  on  the  type  of
wafer to be tested (see Section 7.2).  Be certain that the
series  resistance  of  the  diode  circuit  formed  with  the
reference   wafer   meets   the   requirements   of   Section
11. 4.1.7 or Section 11.4.2.7 before proceeding with the
measurement  of  the  capacitance-voltage  pairs.    Record
each   measured   capacitance,   C
i
,   and   its   associated
voltage, V
i
.    Determine  the  value  of  C
comp
either  from
the  net  carrier  density  profile  (Section  10.2.2)  or  from
V
i
as a function of C
i
−2
(Section 10.2.3).
10. 2.2  Net Carrier Density Profile
10. 2.2.1      Measure   a   total   of   n   pairs,   sufficient   to
calculate  at  least  five  values  of  net  carrier  density,  N
i
,
and depth, W
i
.
NOTE   9:      If   the   incremental   method   of   calculation   (see
Section 12.3) is used, n ≥ k + 5, where k is an integer chosen
such  that  C
i + k
is  between  80  and  85%  of  C
i
;  if  the  curve-
fitting method of calculation (see Section 12.4) is used, n ≥ 5.
10. 2.2.2    Calculate  the  net  carrier  density  profile  in
accordance  with  the  incremental  method  (see  Section
12. 3)  or  the  curve-fitting  method  (see  Section  12.4)
taking C
comp
= 0 (see Section 12.1).
NOTE  10:    If  an  approximate  value  of  C
comp
is  known,  this
procedure may be shortened by starting with this approximate
value.    In  this  case,  if  the  slope  of  the  net  carrier  density
profile   is   positive,   increase   C
comp
as  directed  in  Section
10. 2.2.3  and  Section  10.2.2.4  and  decrease  it  after  the  first
slope  change  as  directed  in  Section  10.2.2.5;  if  the  slope  is
negative, decrease C
comp
initially and increase it after the first
slope change.
10. 2.2.3  Increase C
comp
by  0.1  pF  and  recalculate  the
net  carrier  density  profile  (see  Note  10).    For  the
recalculation, correct each of the C
i
to C′
i
as follows:

NOTE 11:  On some instruments, it may be necessary to enter
a new value for C
comp
and remeasure the reference wafer each
time the value of C
comp
is changed.
10. 2.2.4    Repeat  Section  10.2.2.3,  increasing  the  value
of C
comp
by  0.1  pF  each  time  until  the  slope  of  the
calculated net carrier density profile changes sign.
10. 2.2.5  After  the  slope  of  the  calculated  net  carrier
density  profile  changes  sign,  repeat  Section  10.2.2.3,
decreasing the value of C
comp
by 0.02 pF each time until
the  slope  of  the  calculated  net  carrier  density  profile
changes sign again.
10. 2.2.6  Record  as C

obtained just before and just after the sign change of the
slope.

10. 2.3.4  Correct each of the C

using Eq. 1, fit a

the squares of the normalized residuals using Eq. 2.
10. 2.3.5    If  the  sum  of  the  squares  of  the  normalized
residuals   is   less   than   the   sum   obtained   from   the
previous  case,  increase  C

residuals   is   less   than   the   sum   obtained   from   the
previous  case,  decrease  C

10. 3  Determination    of    Effective    Mercury    Probe
Contact Area
10. 3.1    Using  the  value  of  C
comp
recorded  in  Sections
10. 2.2.6  or  10.2.3.11,  determine  the  net  carrier  density
profile  in  the  central  region  (see  Section  8.4.2)  of  each
reference    wafer    five    times    in    accordance    with
Procedure  (Section  11)  and  Calculations  (Section  12).
Be certain that the series resistance of the diode circuit
formed    with    the    reference        wafer    meets    the
requirements  of  Section  11.4.1.7  or  Section  11.4.2.7
before   proceeding   with   the   measurement   of   the
capacitance-voltage  pairs.    For  these  measurements,
take  the  area  of  the  mercury  probe  contact  as  the
nominal area of the capillary tube holding the mercury,
determined as follows:

400

d

π
=                                  (3)
where:
A =  nominal capillary tube area, cm

, and
d =  nominal diameter of the capillary tube, mm.
NOTE 12:  If the nominal diameter of the capillary tube is not
known,  it  can  be  measured  with  a  toolmaker's  microscope  or
other  appropriate  instrument.    The  area  need  not  be  known
precisely,  an  estimate  within  about  20%  is  adequate  for  the
purpose.
10. 3.2    In  each  of  the  five  measurement  sets  (j  from  1
to  5),  record  each  measured  capacitance,  C
ij
,  and  its
associated voltage, V

this  value  as  the  effective  mercury  probe  contact  area,

10. 3.4.2        If    more    than    one    reference    wafer    was
measured,  determine  and  record  the  effective  mercury
probe  contact  area, A

,  as  the  average  of  the  effective
contact areas for each of the reference wafers.
10. 3.5    For  control  charting  purposes,  repeat  Sections
10. 3.2  and  10.3.3  using  A
eff
as  the  area  of  the  mercury
probe  contact.    If  the  value  of  average  net  carrier
density for any reference wafer differs from the known
value  by  more  than  2%,  condition  the  surfaces  of  the
appropriate   reference   wafer   or   wafers   (see   Related
Information  1)  and  repeat  the  calibration  procedure
(Sections 10.2 and 10.3).  If it is impossible to achieve
deviations  of  2%  or  less  for  all  wafers,  it  may  be
necessary to subdivide the net carrier density range and
assign effective probe contact areas to each subgroup.

procedures are described in Related Information 1.
10. 4  Control Procedures — Periodically carry out tests

of  the  electronics  (Section  10.4.1),  the  electronics  plus
the   mechanical   functionality   of   the   probe   station
(Section 10.4.2), and the entire system (Section 10.4.3).

Attach the diode to the capacitance meter terminals and
carry out the procedure, beginning with Section 11.6.4,
and Calculations, Section 12.
10. 4.1.2  If out-of-control conditions are noted, or if the
control   limits   are   wider   than   is   desirable   for   the
application,  verify  the  performance  of  the  capacitance
meter  and  voltmeter  independently  in  accordance  with
Sections 10.5 and 10.6, respectively, to establish which
requires adjustment or recalibration.
10. 4.2      Monitor   the   performance   of   the   electronic
components  together  with  the  mechanical  functionality
of  the  probe  station  with  a  moving  range  control  chart
of  the  oxide  capacitance,  C
ox

10. 4.2.2  If out-of-control conditions are noted, or if the
control   limits   are   wider   than   is   desirable   for   the
application,   and   the   electronics   are   known   to   be
performing  as  expected,  inspect  the  mercury  capillary
carefully  for  dirt  or  damage.    If  it  is  dirty,  clean  it
thoroughly  and  refill  with  clean  mercury.    If  it  appears
to be damaged, repair or replace the capillary and refill
with clean mercury.
10. 4.3    Monitor  the  overall  system  performance  with
moving range control charts of net carrier density of the
reference  wafers  (see  Sections  8.4  and  10.3)  or  test
specimens used as controls.
10. 4.3.1    Determine  the  net  carrier  density  of  these
specimens in accordance with this test method.  Two or
more  controls  are  required  to  ensure  that  the  control
wafers  are  stable;  if  one  control  becomes  unstable,
retreat  the  surface  (see  Related  Information  1)  and
redetermine  its  net  carrier  density.    If  this  does  not
bring  the  specimen  into  control,  discard  it  and  replace
with a fresh control.
10. 4.3.2    If  system  out-of-control  conditions  are  noted,
or if the control limits are wider than is desirable for the
application,  and  they  cannot  be  attributed  to  control
wafer  instability,  mechanical  malfunctions    (Section
10. 4.2)   or   electronic   malfunction   (Section   10.4.1),
redetermine  C
comp
(see  Section  10.2)  and  the  effective
area of  the mercury probe contact (see Section 10.3).
10. 5  Capacitance Meter Adjustment and Verification
10. 5.1      Connect   to   the   capacitance   bridge   or   meter
shielded  cables  of  a  length  suitable  for  measuring  the
precision  capacitors.    Zero  the  capacitance  bridge  or
meter  with  the  cables  attached  only  to  the  bridge  or
meter, not to a precision capacitor.


SEMI MF1392-1103 © SEMI 2003 10
10. 5.2      Connect   the   cables   to   one   of   the   precision
capacitors.  Measure and record the capacitance in pF to
three  significant  figures.    Disconnect  the  capacitor.
Repeat for the other precision capacitors.
10. 5.3      If   the   measured   capacitance   values   are   not
within   1%   of   the   known   values,   make   necessary
adjustments  consistent  with  the  appropriate  instrument
instruction  manuals  to  bring  the  instrument  to  within
specifications  before  proceeding  with  measurements  of
test specimens.
10. 6  Voltmeter Verification
10. 6.1  Measure  the  precision voltage  source  at  five  or
more  voltages  within  the  range  from  0  to  ±200  V,
inclusive  to  verify  that  the  digital  voltmeter  is  within
specification over this range.
10. 6.2    If  any  measured  voltage  value  is  not  within
0. 5%  of  the  known  value,  make  necessary  adjustments
consistent  with  the  appropriate  instrument  instruction
manuals to bring the instrument to within specifications
before     proceeding     with     measurements     of     test
specimens.
11  Procedure
11. 1  Refer to Related Information 2 for suggested data
sheet   formats   for   recording   the   data   if   the   data
collection  and  calculations  are  carried  out  manually  or
off-line.
NOTE  14:    The  following  procedures  are  given  in  sufficient
detail for manual data collection and calculations to be carried
out.    However,  it  is  strongly  recommended  that  both  data
collection  and  analysis  be  carried  out  using  computer  con-
trolled  equipment,  with  data  storage  and  display  capabilities.
In  such  cases,  the  procedures  and  algorithms  employed  must
be equivalent to those given in this test method.
11. 2  If not known, determine the conductivity type and
surface orientation of the test wafers in accordance with
SEMI MF42 and SEMI MF26, respectively.
11. 3      Estimate   the   reverse   bias   voltage   range   over
which  the  measurements  are  to  be  made  based  on  the
curve  in  Figure  1,  an  estimate  of  the  value  for  the
dopant  density  of  the  test  specimen,  and  the  range  of
depth over which the profile is desired.  Do not exceed
200  V  or  80%  of  the  breakdown  voltage,  whichever  is
lower.
11. 4  Determination  of  the  Series  Resistance  of  the
Diode Circuit — Determine the series resistance of the
diode circuit in one of the following ways:
11. 4.1  Measurement  of  Forward  Resistance  —  If  the
capacitance bridge or meter measures capacitance only,
measure the diode forward resistance, R, in ohms,  at 1
V forward bias as follows:
11. 4.1.1  Connect the curve tracer to the mercury probe
column and to the return contact of the probe fixture.
11. 4.1.2    Place  the  wafer  to  be  tested  onto  the  mercury
probe   fixture   set   up   in   the   configuration   used   to
determine C
comp
(see  Section  10.3)  in  such  a  way  that
the  mercury  column(s)  will  contact  the  polished  or
epitaxial  surface  of  the  wafer.    If  the  back-surface-
return-contact  configuration  is  used,  make  a  suitable
return  contact  to  the  substrate  or  back  surface  of  the
wafer.
11. 4.1.3  Bring the mercury column(s) into contact with
the surface of the wafer.
11. 4.1.4  Measure  and  record  as I
1
the  current  through
the   diode   at   0.9   V   forward   bias,   in   mA,   to   two
significant figures.
11. 4.1.5  Measure  and  record  as I
2
the  current  through
the   diode   at   1.1   V   forward   bias,   in   mA,   to   two
significant figures.
11. 4.1.6  Calculate  the  forward  resistance,  R,  in  kΩ,  as
follows:

R
−

(6)
where:
I
1
=  current at 0.9 V forward bias, mA, and
I
2
=  current at 1.1 V forward bias, mA.
11. 4.1.7  If  the  forward  resistance  is  1  kΩ  or  less,
proceed  to  Section  11.5.    If  the  forward  resistance
exceeds  1  kΩ,  improve  the  return  contact,  and  repeat
Section 11.4.1.
NOTE    15:        The    diode    forward    resistance    at    1    V,    R,
determined  in  this  way  is  a  measure  of  the  total  series
resistance of the test circuit that includes the bulk, cable, and
return contact resistances.
11. 4.2  Direct    Determination    of    Equivalent    Series
Resistance —   For   capacitance   meters   or   bridges
capable  of  measurement  of  phase  angle,  conductance,
or  total  impedance,  determine  the  equivalent  series
resistance directly as follows:
11. 4.2.1    Place  the  wafer  to  be  tested  onto  the  mercury
probe   fixture   set   up   in   the   configuration   used   to
determine C
comp
(see  Section  10.3)  in  such  a  way  that
the mercury column(s) are just above but do not contact
the  polished  or  epitaxial  surface  of  the  wafer.    If  the
back-surface-return-contact configuration is used, make
a suitable return contact to the substrate or back surface
of the wafer.
11. 4.2.2    Zero  the  meter  in  accordance  with  the  manu-
facturer's instructions.


SEMI MF1392-1103 © SEMI 2003 11
11. 4.2.3  Bring the mercury column(s) into contact with
the surface of the wafer.
11. 4.2.4    Set  the  bias  to  a  nominal  value  of  0  V,  and
read  the  capacitance,  C,  and  the  phase  angle,
θ,  or  the
conductance, G
m
.
11. 4.2.5      If   the   phase   angle   and   capacitance   were
measured,  calculate  the  series  resistance,  R

measured, calculate the series resistance, R

the phase angle,

11. 4.2.7  If the series resistance is 1 kΩ or less and the
phase  angle  is  between  −87°  and  −90°,  proceed  to
Section  11.5.    If  either  of  these  conditions  is  not  met,
improve  the  return  contact,  and  repeat  Section  11.4.2.
If  improvement  of  the  return  contact  decreases  the
series  resistance  but  does  not  bring  the  phase  angle
within the desired range, qualify the Schottky contact in
accordance   with   Section   11.5;   when   the   Schottky
contact  is  satisfactory,  repeat  Section  11.4.2  to  verify
that the phase angle is within the desired range.
11. 5  Qualification  of  Schottky  Contact  —  To  qualify
the  Schottky  contact,  determine  the  reverse  current
characteristics of the mercury probe contact as follows:
11. 5.1  If a curve tracer was used to determine the diode
forward  resistance,  do  not  disconnect  it.    If  the  series
resistance was measured directly, connect a curve tracer
or  other  apparatus  for  monitoring  the  current-voltage
characteristics   of   the   mercury   probe   contact   (see
Section 7.7).  Apply a reverse bias voltage of about 1 V
to  the  mercury  column.    Warning:  Avoid  physical
contact with the probe fixture when bias is applied.
11. 5.2    Measure  and  record  this  voltage  as  V
1
,  and
measure   the   current   that   exists   at   this   voltage.
Calculate  the  current  density  at  this  value  of  reverse
bias voltage, J
r1
, in mA·cm
−2
, as follows:

=  current, mA, at the reverse bias voltage V

, and
A
eff
=  mercury  probe  contact  area,  cm

,  see  Section
10. 3.4.
11. 5.3  Increase the magnitude of the reverse voltage at
intervals until the maximum reverse bias voltage that is
to  be  applied  during  the  test  (see  Section  11.3)  is
reached.      Measure   each   current   and   calculate   the
current   density,   J
r
,   at   each   value   of   voltage.      In
addition,  calculate  the  rate  of  increase  of  the  reverse
current   density   with   voltage,   in   mA·V

J

i
, and
J
r(i+1)
=  current density at voltage, V
i+1
.
11. 5.4  Also observe whether or not the reverse current
density is stable with time.
11. 5.5      If   the   reverse   current   density,   J
r
,   equals   or
exceeds  3  mA/cm
2
at  any  voltage  up  to  the  maximum
value  applied,  first  determine  if  this  is  due  to  carrier
density  variations  in  the  structure.    In  this  case,  reduce
the maximum applied reverse bias voltage to be used in
the  test  to  the  highest  value  for  which  the  reverse
current density is less than 3 mA·cm
−2
.
NOTE  16:    If  the  depletion  depth  extends  to  a  region  with  a
rapidly increasing doping density, the breakdown voltage may
be  significantly  lower  than  estimated  from  the  expected  net
carrier density.  For example, if the test specimen consists of a
lightly doped epitaxial layer on a heavily doped substrate and
if  the  profile  extends  deeper  into  the  structure  than  the  flat
region  of  the  layer,  the  breakdown  voltage  would  be  lower
than that estimated from the expected net carrier density in the
flat region.

chemical   process   (see   Related   Information   1),   and
repeat the procedure beginning with Section 11.4.
11. 5.7      When   the   Schottky   contact   is   satisfactory,
disconnect   the   curve   tracer   or   other   apparatus   for
monitoring  the  current-voltage  characteristics  of  the
mercury probe contact.
NOTE  17:    To  ensure  the  greatest  possible  accuracy  of  the
measurement,  monitor  the  attributes  of  the  Schottky  contact
during  the  collection  of  data  (Section  11.6)  and  discontinue
data  collection  if  any  of  the  conditions  in  Section  11.5.6  are
violated.
11. 6  Collection   of   Data   —   Measure   a   series   of
capacitance-voltage  pairs  from  which  the  net  carrier
density profile can be calculated.
11. 6.1    Disconnect  the  curve  tracer  from  the  mercury
probe  fixture  if  one  was  used  to  determine  the  diode
current density.
11. 6.2    Connect  the  capacitance  bridge  or  meter  to  the
mercury  probe  fixture  in  accordance  with  the  manu
-
facturer's  instructions  and  zero  the  capacitance  bridge
or meter, if required.
11. 6.3    Bring  the  mercury  column(s)  into  contact  with
the test wafer surface, and apply a nominal 1 V reverse
bias  between  the  mercury  probe  contact  and  the  return
contact (Warning—see Section 11.5.1).
11. 6.4    Read  and  record  the  capacitance  and  applied
voltage, each to three or more significant figures, as C
1

and V
1
,   respectively.      Use   a   data   table   format
appropriate to the calculation method to be selected.  In
all  cases,  record  the  voltages  as  positive  numbers  even
though reverse biases are involved.
11. 6.5  Adjust the bias voltage to obtain a new value of
capacitance  that  is  up  to  5%  lower  than  the  previous
value.    Read  and  record  the  capacitance  and  applied
voltage, each to three or more significant figures, as C
2

and V
2
, respectively (Warning—see Section 11.5.1).
11. 6.6    Repeat  Section  11.6.5,  adjusting  the  voltage  for
a  decrease  in  capacitance  such  that  the  ratio  of  C
i+1
to
C
i
is approximately equal to C
2
/C
1
at each step, until the
maximum  applied  reverse  bias  voltage  (see  Section
11. 3)  is  reached.    Discontinue  the  measurement  before
the maximum applied reverse bias voltage is reached if
the  capacitance  values  start  to  increase  with  increased
reverse  bias.    Obtain  a  minimum  of n  capacitance-
voltage pairs, where  n is sufficient to calculate at least
five values of net carrier density, N
i
, and depth, W
i
(see
Note 9).
11. 7  Shut-Down   Cycle   —   When   the   measurement
sequence is complete, reduce the reverse bias voltage to
0  V,  disengage  the  mercury  column(s)  from  the  wafer
surface,  and  remove  the  test  wafer  from  the  probe
fixture.

14  Precision and Bias
14. 1  Repeatability —  The  within-laboratory  precision
achievable  with  this  test  method  was  estimated    from
the   results   of   several   experiments.      In   the   first
experiment, ten nominally 50 Ω·cm n-type wafers were
measured on two days by two different operators using
a single instrument.  The pooled coefficient of variation
was   0.183%;   the   largest   observed   coefficient   of
variation was 0.35%.
14. 1.1    Based  on  the  pooled  value,  the  repeatability,  r,
is   estimated   to   be   about   0.51%.      In   the   second
experiment,  ten  nominally  1  Ω·cm n-type  wafers  were
measured three times on a single instrument by a single
operator.  The wafer surfaces were treated prior to each
measurement.    The  pooled  coefficient  of  variation  was
0. 493%;  based  on  this  value    the  repeatability,  r,  is
estimated to be about 1.37%.
14. 2  Reproducibility — The reproducibility of this test
method has not been evaluated because of difficulties in
establishing  and  applying  a  common  specimen  surface
preparation   for   use   in   a   round   robin   to   evaluate
reproducibility.  No such tests are planned.
14. 3  Calculations of the errors in net carrier density, N
i
,
and  depletion  depth,  W
i
,  expected  on  the  basis  of  the
precision   requirements   of   the   various   parameters
measured  in  the  test  procedure  could,  in  principle,  be
made  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  of  Practice
D 4356.  However, because the formulas include ratios
of  differences  of  both  capacitance  and  voltage  and
because  the  voltage  and  capacitance  are  coupled,  these
errors   depend   both   on   the   intervals   chosen   in   the
experiment  and  on  the  physical  characteristics  of  the
test   specimen.      The   calculation   procedure   for   the
incremental  method  included  in  this  test  method  uses
large intervals in order to minimize the errors from the
use  of  finite  intervals  for  the  determination.    For  some
examples of the effect of both random errors and finite
interval  errors  on  the  calculated  value  of  net  carrier
density, N

14. 4  Bias —  The  bias  of  this  test  method  cannot  be
evaluated   because   there   are   no   available   reference
standards suitable for evaluating bias.

TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING SORI ON SILICON WAFERS BY
AUTOMATED NON-CONTACT SCANNING
This  test  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the North American Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org

September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.    Original  edition  published  by  ASTM  International  as
ASTM F 1451-92.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1451-0704.
1 Purpose
1. 1 Sori    can    significantly    affect    the    yield    of
semiconductor device processing.
1. 2 Knowledge   of   this   characteristic   can   help   the
producer  and  consumer  determine  if  the  dimensional
characteristics   of   a   specimen   wafer   satisfy   given
geometrical requirements.
1. 3 Changes   in   wafer   sori   during   processing   can
adversely  affect  subsequent  handling  and  processing
steps.    These  changes  can  also  provide  an  important
process monitoring function.
1. 4 This  test  method  is  suitable  for  measuring  the  sori
of  wafers  used  in  semiconductor  device  processing  in
the as-sliced, lapped, etched, polished, epitaxial or other
layer   condition   and   for   monitoring   thermal   and
mechanical  effects  on  the  sori  of  wafers  during  device
processing.
2 Scope
2. 1 This    test    method    covers    a    non-contacting,
nondestructive procedure to determine the sori of clean,
dry semiconductor wafers.
2. 2 This  test  method  employs  a  two-probe  system  that
examines    both    external    surfaces    of    the    wafer
simultaneously.
2. 3 The  test  method  is  applicable  to  wafers  50  mm  or
larger  in  diameter,  and  approximately  100  μm  and
larger  in  thickness,  independent  of  thickness  variation
and surface finish, and of gravitationally induced wafer
distortion.
2. 4 This  test  method  is  not  intended  to  measure  the
flatness  of  either  exposed  silicon  surface.    Sori  is  a
measure  of  the  distortion  of  the  front  surface  of  the
wafer.
2. 5 This test method measures sori of a wafer corrected
for    mechanical    forces    applied    during    the    test.
Therefore,     the     procedure     described     gives     the
unconstrained value of sori.
NOTE 1:  This sori is indicated by the acronym “GFLYFER”
in Appendix 2, Shape Decision Tree, of SEMI M1.
2. 6 This   test   method   includes   several   methods   for
canceling    gravity-induced    deflection    which    could
otherwise alter the shape of the wafer.
1

NOTE 2:  One  of  these  methods,  the  Representative  Wafer
Inversion  Method,  is  covered  by  a  patent  held  by  ADE
Corporation, 80 Wilson Way, Westwood, MA  02090-1806.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3 Limitations
3. 1 Any relative motion along the probe measuring axis
between the probes and the wafer holding device during
scanning  will  produce  error  in  the  measurement  data.
Vibration  of  the  test  specimen  relative  to  the  probe-
measuring  axis  will  introduce  error.    Such  errors  are
minimized  by  system  signature  analysis  and  correction
algorithms.    Internal  system  monitoring  may  also  be
used  to  correct  non-repetitive  and  repetitive  system
mechanical translations.  Failure to provide such correc-
tions may cause errors.
3. 2 If    a    measured    wafer    differs    substantially    in
diameter,   thickness,   fiducials,   or   crystal   orientation
from   that   used   for   the   gravitational   compensation
procedure,  the  results  may  be  incorrect.    Estimates  of
the  errors  in  gravity  induced  deflection  for  differences
in   diameter   and   thickness   are   shown   in   Related
Information  1.    If  the  crystal  orientation  of  the  sample
to  be  measured  differs  from  the  crystal  orientation  of
the gravity-compensation wafer, then the measured sori
value  may  differ  from  the  actual  sori  value  by  up  to
15%.    Error  tables  for  fiducial  variation  have  not  been
generated.
3. 3 Different  methods  for  implementing  gravitational
compensation   may   give   different   results.      Varying

Characterization, February 1, 1990.


SEMI MF1451-1104 © SEMI 2004 2
levels  of  completeness  of  implementing  a  method  may
also give different results.
3. 4 Mechanical   variations   in   wafer   holding   devices
between     systems     may     introduce     measurement
differences.    This  test  method  allows  the  use  of  a
variety  of  wafer  holding  devices  (see  Section  7.1.4.1);
results      obtained      with      different      geometrical
configurations of wafer holding device on the same test
samples may differ.
3. 5 Most     equipment     systems     capable     of     this
measurement  have  a  definite  range  of  wafer  thickness
combined   with   sori   (dynamic   range)   that   can   be
accommodated  without  readjustment.    If  the  sample
moves   outside   this   dynamic   range   during   either
calibration or measurement, results may be in error.  An
over-range  signal  can  be  used  to  alert  the  operator  and
measurement data examiners to this event.
3. 6 The  quantity  of  data  points  and  their  spacing  may
affect  the  measurement  results.    This  test  method  does
not specify the data point spacing (see Section 7.1.4.2);
results  obtained  with  different  data  point  spacings  on
the same test samples may differ.

6 Summary of Test Method
6. 1 A  calibration  procedure  is  performed  to  set  the
instrument's  scale  factor  and  other  constants.  If  the
representative   wafer   inversion   method   is   used   for
gravity   correction,   the   calibration   procedure   also
determines  the  mechanical  signature  of  the  instrument
and the effect of gravity on the wafer.
6. 2 The  wafer  is  supported  by  a  small-area  chuck  with
front surface up.
6. 3 Both  external  surfaces  are  simultaneously  scanned
along a prescribed pattern by an opposed pair of probes
to  obtain  a  set  of  values  of  the  distances  between  each
surface  and  the  nearest  probe.    In  each  case,  both
members  of  the  pair  of  distances  is  taken  at  the  same
value of the x and y coordinates.
6. 4 The   paired   displacement   values   are   used   to
construct the median surface.
6. 5 A  correction  for  gravity  effects  on  the  median
surface   is   made   either   by   subtracting   a   gravity
correction   obtained   (1)   from   measurements   on   a
representative     wafer     or     (2)     from     theoretical
considerations  or  by  repeating  the  scan  with  the  wafer
inverted.


SEMI MF1451-1104 © SEMI 2004 3
6. 6 One half the thickness at each point is added to the
corrected  median  surface  to  construct  the  corrected
front surface.
6. 7 A  least-squares  reference  plane  is  constructed  from
the corrected front surface.
6. 8 The reference plane deviation (RPD) is calculated at
each measured pair of points.
6. 9 Sori is reported as the algebraic difference between
the most positive RPD and the most negative RPD.

range signal.
7. 1.3  Instrument  data  reporting  resolution  shall  be  100
nm or smaller.
7. 1.4  The measuring equipment contains the following
subsystems:
7. 1.4.1 Wafer-holding   device,   for   example   a   chuck
whose  face  is  perpendicular  to  the  measurement  axis,
and  on  which  the  wafer  is  placed  for  the  measurement
scan.    The  nature  and  size  of  the  wafer  holding  device
shall be agreed upon between the parties to the test.
7. 1.4.2 Multiple-axis    transport    mechanism,    which
provides a means for moving the wafer-holding device,
or    the    probe    assembly,    perpendicularly    to    the
measurement  axis  in  a  controlled  fashion  in  several
directions.    This  motion  must  permit  data  gathering
over a prescribed scan pattern covering the entire fixed
quality  area.    Data  point  spacing  to  be  used  shall  be
agreed upon between the parties to the test.
7. 1.4.3 Probe   assembly   with   paired   non-contacting

7. 1.4.3.2  The   probes   shall   be   mounted   above   and
below the wafer in a manner so that the probed site on
one  surface  of  the  wafer  is  opposite  the  probed  site  on

mm,  or  other  value  to  be  agreed  upon  between  the
parties to the test.
7. 1.4.3.7  Measuring  equipment  employing  either  the
Representative  Wafer  Inversion  Method  or  the  Sample
Wafer Inversion Method for gravity compensation must
provide   precise   positioning   in   both   measurement
orientations so that measurements are taken at identical
locations for each orientation of the sample.
8 Materials
8. 1 Set-up     Masters     —     suitable     to     accomplish
calibration and standardization as recommended by the
equipment manufacturer.
8. 2 Reference Wafer — with a reference sori value ≤20
μm  that  is  used  to  determine  the  level  of  agreement
between   the   sori   value   obtained   by   the   measuring
equipment  under  test  and  the  reference  sori  value  (see
Section 9).
8. 3 Representative   Wafer   —   required   only   if   the

identical   in   nominal   diameter,   nominal   thickness,
fiducials,   composition   and   crystalline   orientation   to
those being measured.  Its sori need not be known.

9 Suitability of Measuring Equipment
9. 1 Determine    the    suitability    of    the    measuring
equipment  with  the  use  of  a  reference  wafer  and  its
reference  sori  value  in  accordance  with  the  procedures
of Sub-section 9.2, or by performance of a statistically-
based    instrument    repeatability    study    to    ascertain
whether    the    equipment    is    operating    within    the
manufacturer's stated specification for repeatability.
9. 1.1  The  reference  sori  value  is  the  average  of  a
number of values obtained for that wafer over a number
of   “passes”   (repeat   measurements).      The   reference
wafer  is  measured  on  the  measuring  equipment  under
test and its reference sori value is compared against the
measured  sori  value.    The  acceptable  level  of  the
agreement  between  the  reference  and  measured  sori
values is to be agreed upon by the parties to the test.
9. 2 Procedure
9. 2.1  Select  a  reference  wafer  of  appropriate  criteria,
together with its associated reference sori value.
9. 2.2  Measure  the  reference  wafer  on  the  measuring
equipment under test to obtain a sample sori value.
9. 2.3  Subtract   the   two   sori   values   to   obtain   the
difference:

samplereferencesori
SoriSori−=∆
(1)
9. 2.4  The  metric  to  be  used  to  determine  acceptability
is difference,
∆
sori.
Accept the measuring equipment as
suitable for use if this difference is less than a value that
is agreed upon between the parties to the test.
NOTE 3:  If   the   measuring   equipment   is   to   be   used   to
measure  other  parameters,  such  as  flatness  and  thickness
variation  in  addition  to  sori,  the  reference  and  sample  sori
values may be included in the reference and sample data sets
specified  in  SEMI  MF1530,  but  this  is  not  necessary  if  only
sori measurements are to be made.
10 Sampling
10. 1 This  test  method  is  nondestructive  and  may  be
used  on  either  100%  of  the  wafers  in  a  lot  or  on  a
sampling basis.
10. 1.1  If   samples   are   to   be   taken,   procedures   for
selecting the sample from each lot of wafers to be tested
shall  be  agreed  upon  between  the  parties  to  the  test,  as
shall the definition of what constitutes a lot.
11 Calibration and Standardization
11. 1 Calibrate  the  measuring  equipment  in  accordance
with the manufacturer's instructions.
11. 2 When  using  the  Representative  Wafer  Inversion
Method  for  correcting  the  gravity-induced  deflection,
determine z
gravity
,  the  deflection  due  to  gravity  and
machine    effects    on    the    representative    wafer,    in
accordance  with  Section  12  and  Section  13  through
paragraph 13.7.
12 Procedure
12. 1 Prepare  the  apparatus  for  measurement  of  wafers,
including  selection  of  diameter,  peripheral  fiducials,
scan area and data display/output functions.  Also select
the  gravitational  correction  method  from  one  of  the
following:
• Reference Wafer Inversion Method (see Note 2),
• Sample Wafer Inversion Method, or
• Theoretical Modeling Method.
12. 2 Select  the  fixed  quality  area  (FQA)  by  specifying
the nominal edge exclusion (EE).
12. 3 Introduce  the  test  specimen  into  the  measurement
mechanism  with  the  front  surface  upward  and  initiate
the measurement sequence to determine and record the
distances  between  each  probe  and  the  nearest  wafer
surface in pairs, a and b, at each measurement position.
Proceed  directly  to  Section  13  unless  (1)  the  Sample
Wafer  Inversion  Method  is  being  used  to  correct  for
effects    of    distortion    due    to    gravity    or    (2)    a
representative  wafer  is  being  measured  to  obtain  the
gravity  correction  for  use  in  the  Representative  Wafer
Inversion Method (see Note 2).
12. 4 Repeat Section 12.2 with the wafer inverted (front
surface downward).
13 Calculations
13. 1 The     following     calculations     are     performed
automatically  within  the  instrument.    An  outline  of  the
calculation  structures  is  provided  here  to  indicate  the
nature of the procedure.
13. 2 Determine  the  displacements  (distances)  between
each  probe  and  the  nearest  surface  of  the  wafer  (in
pairs) at intervals along the scan pattern.
NOTE 4:  From  Figure  1,  note  that  the  distance  between
Probe A  and  the  nearest  surface  of  the  wafer  is  displacement
value a  and  the  distance  between  Probe  B  and  the  nearest
surface of the wafer is displacement value b.
13. 3 Set the origin of the z-axis at the midpoint between
the two probes, A and B.
13. 4 Find  the  distance,  z
m
,  of  the  median  surface  from
the z-axis origin at each point.  From Figure 1,

wafer-periphery effects, some machine-specific signature, etc.

made during the determination of sori:
• two  measurements  on  the  reference  wafer  in  the

1. Scope
1. 1  This  test  method  covers  the  quantitative  determination  of  elemental  areal  density  on  the  surface  of  polished  single
crystal  silicon    substrates  using  total  reflection  X-ray  fluorescence  spectroscopy  (TXRF
1
)  with  a  monochromatic  X-ray
source.
2

1. 2 This test method can be used for both  n-type and  p-type silicon.
1. 3 This test method can be used to detect surface elemental contamination that is within the analyte depth of approximately
5 nm for highly mirror-polished silicon wafers. The analytic depth increases  with surface roughness.
3

1. 4  This  test  method  is  especially  useful  for  determining  the  surface  elemental  areal  densities  in  the  native  oxide  or  in
chemically  grown oxide of polished silicon wafers after cleaning.
1. 5 This test method is useful for elemental areal densities between 10
9
and 10
15
atoms/cm
2
within the measurement area.
See Annex A1 for a discussion of  the relationship between repeatability and detection limit.
1. 6 This test method is useful for detecting elements with atomic number between 16 (S) and 92 (U), depending upon the
X-ray  source    provided  in  the  instrument.  This  test  is  especially  useful  for  detecting  the    following  metals  or  elements:
potassium,  calcium,  titanium,  vanadium,  chromium,    manganese,  iron,  cobalt,  nickel,  copper,  zinc,  arsenic,  molybdenum,
palladium,  silver, tin, tantalum, tungsten, platinum, gold, mercury, and lead.
1. 7  The  detection  limit  depends  upon  atomic  number,  excitation  energy,  photon  flux  of  excitation  X-rays,  instrumental
background,    integration  time,  and  blank  value.  For  constant  instrumental  parameters,  the    interference-free  detection  limits
vary over two orders of magnitude as a  function of atomic number of the element.
1. 8 This test method is nondestructive.
1. 9 This test method is complementary to a variety of other test methods:
1. 9.1 Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis that can detect elemental surface areal densities down to the order of 10
13

atoms/cm
2
.
1. 9.2 Auger electron spectroscopy that can detect elemental surface areal densities down to the order of 10
2
atoms/cm
2
.
1. 9.3  Nitrogen-beam  Rutherford  backscattering  spectrometry  that  can  detect  down  to  10
10
atoms/cm
2
for  some  elements
but cannot mass resolve heavy elements of nearby atomic number.
1. 9.4 Secondary ion mass spectrometry that can detect low-atomic-number elemental areal densities in the range of 10
8
to
10
12
atoms/cm
2
but cannot provide adequate detection  limits for transition metals with atomic number between 22 titanium and
30  zinc. This method is destructive.
1. 9.5 Vapor phase decomposition (VPD) of surface metals followed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), where the
metal  detection    limits  are  from  10
8
to  10
11
atoms/cm
2
,    but  there  is  no  spatial  information  available  and  the  analysis  time  is
longer  than TXRF. This method is destructive.
1. 10  This  test  method  uses  X-radiation;  it  is  absolutely  necessary  to  avoid  personal  exposure  to  X-rays.  It  is  especially
important  to keep hands or fingers out of the path of the X rays and to protect the  eyes from scattered secondary radiation.
The use of commercial film badge  or dosimeter service is recommended, together with periodic checks of the  radiation level
at the hand and body positions with a Geiger-Muller counter  calibrated with a standard nuclear source. The present maximum
permissible  dose for total body exposure of an individual to external X-radiation of quantum  energy less than 3 MeV over an
indefinite period is 1.25 R (3.22 × 10
−4
C/kg) per calendar quarter (equivalent to 0.6 mR/h (1.5 × 10
−7
C/kg-h) as established
in the Code of Federal Regulations,  Title 10, Part 20. The present maximum permissible dose of hand and forearm  exposure

herein.

Besides  the  above  stated  regulations,  various  other    government  and  regulatory  organizations  have  their  own  safety
requirements.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  user  to  make  sure  that  the  equipment  and  the    conditions  under  which  it  is  used
meet these regulations (see 1.11).
1. 11 This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  all  of  the  safety  concerns,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.  It  is  the
responsibility  of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices  and determine the applicability
of regulatory limitations prior to use.

3. Terminology
3. 1 Most terms used in this test method are defined in Terminology E 135.
3. 2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard:
3. 2.1  anglescan—a measurement of the emitted fluorescence signal as a function of glancing angle.
3. 2.2 critical angle—the incident X-ray glancing angle below which total external reflection of the incident  X-ray occurs.
4. Summary of Test Method
4. 1 Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of the technique. Monochromatic X rays from an X-ray source impinge the surface of  a
polished silicon substrate at a glancing angle that is below the angle for  total external reflection of the X rays. The evanescent
wave of the X rays  penetrates the polished silicon surface with an exponential decay of intensity  versus depth dependent upon
the total electron density of the native oxide  and the silicon substrate. One exponential decay length is approximately 5  nm for
silicon of all resistivity.
4. 2 The evanescent wave excites the fluorescence energy levels of the surface atoms which then emit fluorescence X-rays
characteristic  of their atomic number. Emitted fluorescence X-rays are detected by a lithium-drifted  silicon detector, or other
solid  state  detector,  which  is  an  energy  dispersive    spectrometer.  Experience  indicates  that  for  measurement  of  samples  with
high  levels (>10
11
atoms/cm
2
) of specific elements that have  been measured with other methods, such as those listed in 1.9,
the integrated counts per second under the fluorescence peaks are linearly  proportional to the elemental areal density.
4. 3  Reproducible,  rapid  analysis  can  be  accomplished  using  a  calibration  specimen,  supplied  by  the  TXRF  instrument
manufacturer    or  developed  by  another  company,  with  at  least  one  known  elemental  areal  density    in  the  measurement  area.
This  calibration  specimen  is  analyzed  by  the  TXRF    instrument  to  provide  a  measured  number  of  integrated  fluorescence
counts  per second corresponding to the known elemental areal density. Then one or  more test specimens are analyzed under
the  same  instrumental  conditions.  The    integrated  fluorescence  counts  per  second  for  the  elements  detected  on  the    test
specimen are quantified using relative sensitivity factors (RSFs) with  respect to the calibration element count rate per known
areal  density,  where    the  RSFs  are  contained  within  the  instrument  software.  The  lack  of  true  standards    precludes
determination of the accuracy of this test method.
5. Significance and Use
5. 1 TXRF can measure the elemental, particularly metal, areal densities on polished silicon wafer product.
5. 2  The  TXRF  measurement  facilitates  the  production  of  silicon  wafers  with  controlled  upper  limits  on  metal  areal
densities.
5. 3 This test method can be used for monitoring a mirror-polished wafer cleaning process, research and development, and
materials acceptance  purposes.

6. Interferences
6. 1  The  interferences  in  conventional  X-ray  fluorescence  spectroscopy  are  common  to  TXRF  also.  These  include,  but  are
not limited to:  overlap of fluorescence lines, escape peak and sum peak overlap, energy gain  calibration drift, X-ray source
stability,  and  instrumental  background  peaks.    However,  no  X-ray  fluorescence  corrections  for  secondary  fluorescence  or  for
matrix absorption are required for TXRF. Interferences common to software  procedures and calculations can be evaluated by
comparing data sets; see Annex A1.
6. 2 In addition to conventional interferences, there are interferences that are unique to TXRF as follows:
6. 2.1 If the glancing angle calibration is not reproducible, variability is introduced to the measurement,
6. 2.2 If the glancing angle calibration is inaccurate, bias is introduced to the measurement,
6. 2.3 If the anglescan of the known elemental impurity on the calibration specimen is different from the elemental impurity
anglescan    on  the  test  specimen,  this  may  introduce  a  bias  to  the  quantification.  An    example  can  be  the  measurement  of
particulate  metal  contamination  on  a  test    specimen  while  using  a  calibration  specimen  which  has  the  calibration  metal
localized within the native oxide,
6. 2.4 Mechanical vibration may degrade the detector energy resolution, and this may degrade detection limits,
6. 2.5 If the specimen is not chem-mechanically polished, there will be a loss in detection capability, a bias in quantification,
and    an  increase  in  variability  of  the  measurement.  There  is  some  possibility  that    the  surface  roughness  and  waviness
differences  from  different  cleaning  processes    may  cause  these  interferences  also.  The  semiquantitative  effect  of  surface
roughness upon the TXRF measurement is under study.
6. 2.6 Bias in the assigned elemental areal density of the calibration specimen can introduce bias into the TXRF measured
areal densities,
6. 2.7  Surface  contamination  introduced  during  handling  of  the  test  specimens  or  during  the  measurement  itself  will
introduce a bias  to the measurement, if this surface contamination contains the element(s)  to be measured,
6. 2.8 Bias in the RSF of a fluorescence line can introduce bias to the measurement,
6. 2.9  Nonlinearity  of  detected  fluorescence  signal  versus  impurity  areal  density  may  occur  due  to  high  deadtime  of  some
detectors under  the condition of high-total signal count rates, and
6. 2.10 Fluorescence curve smoothing may affect the quantification accuracy.
6. 2.11  Instrumental  peaks  may  be  generated  by  the  incident  X-ray  beam  diffracting  from  the  silicon  crystal  and  the
diffracted beam entering  the detector to excite metals in the detector window or detector housing.  This effect can be tested for
by appropriate experiments.

7. Apparatus
7. 1 TXRF  Instrument,      equipped  with  a  monochromatic  X-ray  source,  test  specimen  handling  equipment,    a  method  for
glancing  angle  calibration,  an  energy-dispersive  spectrometer    X-ray  detector,  software  for  background  subtraction,  peak
integration, analysis  and RSFs, and an analysis ambient without argon (for example, vacuum of 10
−2
torr, or helium gas). The
methods  for  glancing  angle  calibration    are  presently  proprietary  for  each  TXRF  instrument  manufacturer.  A  TXRF
manufacturer  may include a subtraction routine for escape peaks and these signals may already  be removed.
7. 2 Reference  Wafer—  The  suitability  of  the  apparatus  shall  be  determined  with  the  use  of  a  reference    wafer  and  its
associated  data  set  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  of  Annex  A2,  or  by  performance  of  a  statistically-based  instrument
repeatability    study  to  ascertain  whether  the  equipment  is  operating  within  the  manufacturer's    stated  specification  for
repeatability.
7. 3 Class  100  Air  Environment—The  area  for  sample  transfer  to  the  instrument  measurement  stage  must  be  enclosed  in
this.
8. Sampling
8. 1  A  sampling  procedure  must  be  used  to  evaluate  the  characteristics  of  a  group  of  silicon  wafers.  No  general  sampling
procedure  is included as part of this test method, because the most suitable sampling  plan will vary considerably depending
upon  individual  conditions.  For  referee    purposes,  a  sampling  plan  shall  be  agreed  upon  before  conducting  the  test.    See
Practice E 122 for suggested choices of sampling  plans.

11. Calibration Standard
11. 1 The calibration standard and the method of its preparation must be agreed upon between the parties.
NOTE 1—Several methods for preparing calibration standards are in practice.
8

The present state-of-the-art calibration standard is a chem-mechanical polished silicon substrate with a surface metal areal density of between
1  by 10
12
and 1 by 10
14
atoms/cm
2
located in  the analysis area. The k-alpha fluorescence signal  from the calibration standard metal is free
of interferences, that is, escape  peaks, sum peaks, and fluorescence peaks from other contamination, and free  from external contamination
sources. The preferred element should not be easily  added as a contaminated element (for example, iron) or diffuse away from the  analyte
depth  over  time  (for  example,  gold  or  copper).  The  preferred  element    is  nickel  or  vanadium.  Calibration  can  also  be  done  using  a  set  of
wafers  with different known areal densities of a particular element.
The  calibration  standard  should  have  been  measured  by  an  appropriate  analytical  method  to  determine  the  metal  areal  density  of  the
calibration  metal. Some analytical methods which have been used for assigning quantitative  values to calibration standards include:
(a) Nitrogen-Beam Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (N-RBS)—If this method is used, there should not be any other metals present at
levels  greater  than  1  %  of  the  calibration  metal    areal  density  within  a  mass  range  of  ±5  atomic  mass  unit.  The  N-RBS    measurement  is
absolute  and  must  be  made  within  the  analysis  area  of  the  TXRF.    Other  backscattering  methods  are  also  used  to  calibrate  elemental areal
densities.  These include forward scattering Rutherford backscattering (F-RBS) and heavy  ion backscattering spectrometry (HIBS).
(b)  Vapor  Phase  Decomposition—This  followed  by  atomic  absorption  spectrometry  (VPD/AAS)  is  used  to  calibrate  a  spin  coating
contamination process for making calibration standards. The VPD/AAS measurement  is destructive. The contamination process should also
be  shown  to  be  uniform    across  the  wafer  by  using  TXRF  or  SIMS  mapping.  The  VPD/AAS  absolute  assignment    is  based  upon  Atomic
Absorption Spectroscopy standards. An error in the elemental  recovery rate of VPD is a source of error in accuracy.
(c) Implant—Ion implant the reference element into a pre-amorphized silicon surface and using solid phase epitaxy  to regrow the amorphous
silicon  into  crystal  silicon.
9
This  procedure  sweeps  the  ion  implanted  reference  element  to  the  sample  surface    if  the  reference  element  is
much more soluble in the amorphous silicon than  in the crystal silicon. The assignment of the quantitative level in atoms/cm
2
is done using
the ion implant current to determine the implant dose.
(d) Diluted Atomic Absorption Standard Solution—Deposit onto a polished silicon substrate a diluted atomic absorption standard solution  of
a metal onto a localized spot much less than the size of the TXRF analysis  area. This approach assumes none of the calibration metal is lost

during the  drying of the solution. The deposition spot must be easily found by the TXRF  instrument in order to analyze the entire deposited
dried solution. The absolute  assignment is based upon the AAS standards. The deposited solution must produce  one of two TXRF anglescan
forms:
(1) A metal fluorescence count rate versus angle that is independent of glancing angle for angles 80 % below the  critical angle (see Curve (a)
in Fig. 2
10
).
(2) A metal fluorescence count rate versus angle that is characteristic of metal contamination localized within a 3-nm  thickness of the surface
(see Curve (b) in  Fig. 2).
11. 2 An anglescan of the calibration standard must be made to verify if the anglescan of the calibration element is similar to
Curve  (a) (residue) or Curve (b)  (in the film) in Fig. 2.
11. 3  An  appropriate  non-TXRF  measurement  of  the  calibration  standard  must  be  agreed  upon  between  parties  in  order  to
assign the elemental  areal density to the calibration standard element.
11. 4 The calibration of the other elements detectable by the TXRF instrument must be completed using relative sensitivity
factor    (RSFs)  developed  by  the  instrument  manufacturer  and  stored  in  the  instrument    computer  program.  These  RSFs  are  a
function of the X-ray source energy, the  atomic number of the fluorescing element, and the fluorescence energy level,  so if the
X-ray source energy is changed, a different set of RSFs must be  used.
12. Procedure
12. 1 Turn on the instrument in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
12. 2 Analytical Conditions:
12. 2.1 Choose and record the analytical conditions for the test specimen measurement. This includes:
12. 2.1.1 Voltage to the X-ray source,
12. 2.1.2 Current to the X-ray source,
12. 2.1.3 Ambient in the analysis chamber,
12. 2.1.4 Glancing angle,
12. 2.1.5 Integration time,
12. 2.1.6 X-ray source energy, and
12. 2.1.7 Analysis location on the test specimen.

# 13

13. Calibration
13. 1 Load the calibration specimen into the TXRF instrument in a contamination free environment defined by Class 100 or
better.
13. 2 Measure the TXRF spectrum of the calibration specimen under  the  same  operating  conditions  of  current  and  voltage
applied to the  X-ray source and of glancing angle to be used for the measurement of the test  specimen. The measurement time
and  the  ambient  (for  example,  vacuum,  air,    nitrogen,  helium,  etc)  in  the  analysis  chamber  may  be  different  between  the
calibration and test specimen measurements. If the calibration anglescan is  similar to Curve (b) of Fig. 2, use  a glancing angle
which is 70 to 80 % of the critical angle. If the  calibration anglescan is similar to Curve (a) of Fig. 2, use any glancing angle
that is below 85 % of the critical  angle.
13. 3  A  polished  silicon  substrate  with  no  detectable  elemental  contamination  (that  is,  a  BLANK),  or  a  series  of  polished
silicon  substrates each of which shows no detectable metal contamination for a selected  element of interest (that is, a set of
element-specific  BLANKs)  and  which    collectively  represent  a  blank  for  all  elements  of  interest,  must  be  measured    by  the
TXRF  measurement  under  the  condition  of  the  test  specimen  to  verify    three  are  no  instrumental  background  signals.  An
example BLANK for all elements  except sulfur is shown in  Fig. 3.
13. 4  Have  the  TXRF  instrument  integrate  the  calibration  elemental  fluorescence  signal  and  subtract  the  background  to
obtain  a  net    integrated  counts/second  that  corresponds  to  the  assigned  elemental  areal    density.  The  background  may  be
subtracted by a deconvolution routine or by  a linear fit routine.

15. 1 Precision—The precision was estimated through two round robins using monochromatic TXRF  instruments.
15. 1.1 The within-laboratory precision was estimated from a sequential round robin
12
that used two reference samples  and
six  unknowns  with  surface  contamination  of  iron,  nickel,  copper  and  zinc,    between  10
11
and  10
12
atoms/cm
2
.  Thirteen
laboratories participated. At each laboratory the samples were measured once  per day for 4 days. The measurement conditions
were  X-ray  rotating  anode  with    a  tungsten  target,  LiF  (200)  monochromator  (9.67  keV  line  selected),  30  kV,    200  mA,
glancing angle of 0.05°, 10
−2
torr ambient,  10-mm diameter analysis area, and 1000-s integration time. The data were reported
by  each  laboratory  as  the  average  of  the  four  readings  and  the  one  standard    deviation  of  the  four  readings.  The  95  %
confidence,  within-laboratory    relative  precision  was  28  %,  that  is,  2.8  times  the  within-laboratory    relative  one  standard
deviation of 10 %.
15. 1.2 The between-laboratory precision was estimated from a spoke wheel round robin
13
that used sets of  one reference
sample and three unknowns, one of which was a BLANK. The reference  sample and the unknowns were contaminated with
surface nickel between 10
11
and 10

. Seventeen organizations  participated. At each laboratory the samples were
measured  on  multiple  days.    The  measurement  conditions  were  X-ray  rotating  anode  with  a  tungsten  or  gold    target,
monochromator (9.67 keV or higher line selected), 30 kV, 200 mA or  higher, glancing angle of 0.1°, 10-mm diameter analysis
area,  and  1000-s    integration  time.  The  95  %  confidence  between-laboratory  precision    was:  ±8  ×  10

A1. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REPEATABILITY AND DETECTION LIMIT

A1.1    The  consensus  method  to  determine  the  limit  of  detection,  c
L
,  in  a  photon  spectroscopy,  when  there  is  no
instrumental peak to subtract, is given  as follows
13
:
c
L
= 3s
b
/S     (A1.1)
where:

s
b
=  the standard deviation of the BLANK measures, and
S   =   the sensitivity (net signal divided by atoms/cm
2
).

The numeral 3 in Eq. A1.1 is chosen so that a 99.6 % confidence level applies for a strictly one-sided Gaussian distribution; but
it is recognized that at low concentrations, non-Gaussian distributions are  more likely.
A1.1.1       It  is  commonly  assumed  that  the  standard  deviation  of  the  BLANK  measures,  for  short  term  measurements,  is
given by  Poisson statistics of the photons, and this leads to Eq A2.2 for the limit  of detection which is commonly reported in
the technical literature.

net signal   (A1.2)

A1.1.2  This  limit  of  detection  includes  the  key  assumption  that  the  standard  deviation  of  the  BLANK  measures  is  given
only  by  Poisson    statistics  of  the  X-ray  photons,  and  that  no  other  variability  contribution    is  significant  for  this  term.  This
assumption may be valid only for short  term estimation of the limit of detection.
A1.2  For long term estimation of the limit of detection, the standard deviation of the BLANK measures is expected to have
contributions  from  other  variabilities    than  just  the  Poisson  statistics,  and  therefore  the  long  term  estimation  of    the  limit  of
detection  is  expected  to  be  larger  than  the  short  term  limit    of  detection.  Examples  of  other  contributions  to  variability  in  the
BLANK  measures may include, but not be limited to, the glancing angle calibration  and X-ray beam divergence.


A2. COMPARING DATA SETS

A2.1 Introduction
A2.1.1 In qualifying a measurement system for operation, it can be useful to compare values ascribed to an artifact such as
a  reference    sample  against  those  obtained  for  that  artifact  on  a  machine  under  test.  This    annex  outlines  a  way  in  which  the
multiple  element  measurement  data  can  be    used  to  monitor  the  effects  of  interferences  that  may  arise  from  software
procedures and calculations in the instrument.
A2.1.2 A data set is that set of data used in computation of surface elemental contamination by TXRF.
A2.1.3 A referee wafer (artifact) is accompanied by its own data set (referee data set (RDS)), in which each data point is the
average  of a number of repeated measurements. The artifact is measured on a machine  under test and its RDS is compared
against  the  resultant  measured  sample  data    set.  Differences  in  the  data  sets  are  computed.  The  parameter  used  to  determine
agreement  between  the  artifact  and  the  system  under  test  and  the  acceptable    level  of  this  agreement  is  to  be  agreed  upon
between the using parties.
A2.2 Summary of Test Method
A2.2.1 Select a referee wafer of appropriate criteria, for which an RDS has been obtained.
A2.2.2 Measure the referee wafer on the machine under test to obtain a sample data set (SDS).
A2.2.3 Subtract the two to obtain a difference data set (DDS) as follows:

analysis—II, Data Interpretation,” Spectrochemica Acta, Vol 33,  1978, pp. 242–245.


SEMI MF1526-95 © SEMI 2004 10
RDS − SDS = DDS
(A2.1)
where:

DDS   =   the differences between the measurements made on
the machine under test and  the referee data set.

The DDS contains many values. The simplest metric that can be used to determine acceptability is the maximum difference,
the  largest  absolute  value    in  the  DDS.  This  represents  the  worst-case  disagreement  between  the  machine    under  test  and  the
referee data.
A2.2.4 Accept the machine as suitable for measurement if the maximum difference is less than a value that is agreed upon
between  the parties to the test.
A2.2.5  More  complex  calculations  may  also  be  used,  for  example,  a  histogram  of  the  (element-by-element)  values  of  the
DDS along with  statistical measures (mean, sigma, etc) may be compared. These measures can  be compared to application-
specific limits or used to provide insight into  the nature and source of the difference, or both.

GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS
AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF
INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  for  publication  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  16,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org

September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.    Original  edition  published  by  ASTM  International  as
ASTM F 1527-94.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1527-02.
1  Purpose
1. 1  Resistivity    is    a    widely    used    parameter    for
specification  and  characterization  of  silicon  wafers  for
use in fabricating semiconductor devices and integrated
circuits.      Many   types   of   instrumentation   used   for
making  resistivity  measurements  including  the  non-
contact       eddy-current       instruments       used       for
measurements  made  in  accordance with SEMI MF673,
DIN  50445,  or  DIN  50447  require  calibration  because
they     are     relative     measurements.          Although
measurements  made  with  in-line  four-point  probes  in
accordance  with  SEMI  MF84  or  DIN  50441  are,  in
principle, absolute, control charts should be maintained
for  four-point  probes  because  one  cannot  always  be
sure that the electrical resistivity of the test specimen is
sufficiently  homogeneous  for  the  theoretical  model  of
the method to apply, that the electrical thickness of the
wafer   is   exactly   equal   to   its   measured   mechanical
thickness,  or  that  the  stability  of  the  instrument  is
adequate.
1. 2  Instruments  for  measuring  such  related  parameters
as spreading resistance (used in accordance with SEMI
MF525  or  SEMI  MF672),  net  carrier  density  (used  in
accordance  with  SEMI  MF1392,  SEMI  MF1393,  or
DIN  50439),  and  sheet  resistance  (used  in  accordance
with SEMI MF1529) also require calibration.
1. 3  For  all  these  purposes,  wafers  of  known  resistivity
are  required.    Such  wafers  are  supplied  by  several
sources  with  a  wide  range  of  certified  or  calibrated
resistivity values.  Although these wafers are often used
directly, the resistivity values represented by purchased
standards   can   also   be   transferred   to   an   in-house
resistivity  reference  wafer  that  is  then  used  for  routine
instrument calibration or control.
1. 4  The   accuracy   with   which   this   transfer   can   be
affected  depends  not  only  on  the  procedures  for  using
such  reference  wafers  but  also  on  the  procedures  for
material    selection,    instrument    qualification,    and
calibration of the reference wafer.  This guide provides
recommendations  for  procedures  for  these  operations
appropriate  to  obtaining  the  best  available  accuracy  in
use of resistivity reference wafers.
1. 5  These  procedures  are  specifically  intended  for  use
in    measuring    the    resistivity    of    silicon    wafers.
Extension    to    resistivity    measurements    on    other
semiconductor  materials  or  to  resistivity  values  outside
the range covered by the resistivity reference wafers has
not been demonstrated.
2  Scope
2. 1  This   guide   covers   the   application   of   Certified
Reference      Materials      (CRMs)      for      resistivity
measurements  on  silicon  wafers.    Specifically,  this
guide  covers  the  use  of  these  CRMs  for  preparing
resistivity reference wafers and for ensuring the quality
of the instrumentation used for preparing them.
2. 2  The  guide  covers  the  selection  of  materials  for
resistivity  reference  wafers,  procedures  for  preparing
and  calibrating  resistivity  reference  wafers,  and  use  of
resistivity  reference  wafers  in  qualifying,  calibrating,
and     controlling     various     types     of     resistivity
instrumentation.
2. 3  The   guide   provides   criteria   for   selection   of
instruments  for  determining  the  resistivity  of  silicon
resistivity     reference     materials,     procedures     for
maintaining   such   instruments   in   statistical   quality
control,    and    training    requirements    for    operators
engaged   in   making   and   using   resistivity   reference
wafers.
2. 4  Related  Information  is  included  that  covers  (1)
suggested control charting procedures for organizations
that  do  not  already  have  such  procedures  in  place,  and
(2)  errors  in  resistivity  determination  that  result  from
uncertainties  in  wafer  diameter,  wafer  thickness,  and
probe-tip spacing.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

5  Reagents
5. 1  Purity of Reagents — All chemicals for which such
specifications  exist  shall  conform  to  Grade  1  SEMI
specifications   for   those   specific   chemicals.      Other
grades may be used, provided it is first determined that
the  chemical  is  of  sufficiently  high  purity  to  permit  its
use without lessening the accuracy of the test.
5. 2  Purity  of  Water  —  Reference  to  water  shall  be
understood  to  mean  water  meeting  the  requirements  of
Type  E-3  water  or  better  as  described  in  ASTM  Guide
D 5127.
5. 3  The    recommended    chemicals    shall    have    the
following nominal assays:
5. 3.1  Nitric  Acid,    HNO
3
,  concentrated,  70  to  71%,
Grade 1 in accordance with SEMI C35,
5. 3.2  Hydrofluoric  Acid,  HF,  concentrated,  49.00  ±
0. 25%, Grade 1 in accordance with SEMI C28, and
5. 3.3  Potassium  Hydroxide,  KOH,  pellets,  85%  min,
Grade 1 in accordance with SEMI C39.
5. 4  KOH   Etching   Solution   —   Dissolve   potassium
hydroxide (KOH) in water to make a 50 weight % KOH
solution   in   sufficient   volume   to   allow   complete
immersion of the largest wafers to be prepared for test.
This  solution  is  to  be  used  at  a  temperature  of  65  to
75°C.
5. 5  Etching Solution (15 + 1) — Mix 15 parts of nitric
acid (HNO
3
) with one part of hydrofluoric acid (HF) in
sufficient  volume  to  allow  complete  immersion  of  the
largest wafers to be prepared for test.
6  Resistivity CRMs
6. 1  Resistivity   CRMs   are   available   from   several
sources  in  a  variety  of  configurations,  orientations,
conductivity    types,    and    resistivity.        Choose    the
configuration   to   match   the   desired   application   as
closely as possible.  For example, choose whole wafers
for  applications  involving  whole  wafer  measurements
and  chip  sets  with  relatively  closely  spaced  resistivity
values   and   appropriate   orientation   and   conductivity
type for applications involving spreading resistance.
7  Control of Primary Resistivity Measuring
Instruments
7. 1  “Primary”   resistivity   measuring   instruments   are
four-point    probes    used    for    calibrating    resistivity
reference  wafers.    Such  instruments  must  (1)  meet  the
requirements  of  SEMI  MF84,  (2)  be  maintained  in  a
state of control through the use of
X
and s instrument


SEMI MF1527-1104 © SEMI 2003, 2004 4
control  charts  (see  Section  7.1.1),  (3)  return  measured
resistivity values of appropriate CRMs to within desired
limits  through  measurement  of  resistivity  CRMs  at
regular intervals (see Section 7.1.2), and (4) be operated
within  the  temperature  range specified in SEMI MF84
(see Section R2-4 of this guide).
7. 1.1
Instrument  Control  Charts  —X  and  s  control
charts should be maintained to establish the stability of
the  instrument  over  the  range  of  resistivity  that  the
instrument  is  expected  to  measure.    A  separate  control
chart  should  be  maintained  for  each  reference  wafer
used.    Initially,  resistivity  CRMs  or  other  wafers  with
adequate radial resistivity uniformity (see Section 8.5.1)
should be used for this purpose.  As resistivity reference
wafers    are    prepared,    these    should    be    used    for
maintaining    the    control    charts.        After    in-house
resistivity   reference   wafers   become   available,   it   is
recommended that three wafers at each resistivity level
be  set  aside  for  control  charting.    Two  of  these  should
be used for maintaining the
X and s charts on a regular
basis.  The third is retained as a reference to ensure that
any  apparently  out-of-control  conditions  are  due  to  the
instrument   and   not   to   changes   in   sample   surface
conditions,  as  might  occur  after  prolonged  use  of  a
particular   sample.      Each   resistivity   determination
should  consist  of  six  to  ten  measurements  made  in
accordance  with  SEMI  MF84.    Established  procedures
for  generating  and  maintaining  the  control  charts  and
for    determining    the    existence    of    out-of-control
conditions and the need for corrective action should be
used.    A  suggested  procedure  for  these  determinations
is   given   in   Section   R1-2   for   use   in   organizations
without previously established procedures.
7. 1.2
Comparison    with    CRMs    —     To     provide
traceability, measurements of the resistivity of available
CRMs that encompass the range of resistivity expected
to  be  encountered  should  be  made  on  a  periodic,  but
less frequent, basis.  In addition to being in control, the
instruments   should   return   measured   values   of   the
resistivity  of  the  CRMs  that  do  not  deviate  from  their
certified value by more than the root mean square of the
two-sigma (95 % confidence level estimate) uncertainty
of  the  CRM  (Note  1)  and  the  two-sigma  instrument
variability  determined  by  control  charting  procedures
(Note 2).  A suggested procedure for control charting of
CRMs is given in Section R1-3 for use in organizations
without previously established procedures.
NOTE 1:  A  laboratory  issuing  a  CRM  should  provide  a
comprehensive  statement  of  its  uncertainty  associated  with
the  measurement  and  reporting  of  the  CRM  value.    This
should  include  evaluations,  or  estimates,  of  both  random  and
systematic “errors” following ISO procedures for Type A and
Type B evaluations of components of uncertainty.  The result
would  be  expressed  as  a  Combined  Standard  Uncertainty
(standard  deviation,  or  square-root  of  a  sum  of  variances  of
uncertainty components), or as an “Expanded Uncertainty” (2
times  the  Combined  Standard  Uncertainty).    If  based  on
sufficient   statistical   degrees   of   freedom,   the   Combined
Standard   Uncertainty   is   a   one-sigma   estimate,   and   the
Expanded  Uncertainty  is  a  two-sigma,  or  95%  confidence-
level,  estimate.    If  there  are  insufficient  statistical  degrees  of
freedom,  the  effective  number  of  degrees  of  freedom  should
be   reported   by   the   CRM-issuing   laboratory.      It   is   then
necessary  to  multiply  the  uncertainty  value  provided  by  the
student-t  factor  appropriate  to  that  number  of  degrees  of
freedom  in  order  to  obtain  values  for  the  one-sigma  or  two-
sigma (95% confidence-level) measurement uncertainty.
NOTE 2:  A  laboratory  following  this  procedure  to  establish
traceability  to  resistivity  CRMs  incorporates  a  value  of  its
measurement    uncertainty    based    on    its    control    chart
measurements,    which    evaluate    random    components    of
uncertainty  only.    If  the  laboratory  then  measures  a  value  for
the  CRM  within  the  total  uncertainty  interval,  calculated
following  the  root-mean-square  procedure,  above,  about  the
certified  value,  its  instrument  is  validated  for  use.    If  it
measures  a  value  outside  the  prescribed  interval,  this  is  an
indication that its measurement bias with respect to true value
is  statistically  significant  at  the  95%  level,  and  instrument
repair, or “calibration” is necessary before proceeding.
7. 1.3  Probe  Assembly  and  Electrical  Equipment  Tests
—   Should   an   out-of-control   or   out-of-specification
condition   be   encountered,   the   probe   assembly   and
electrical  equipment  can  be  tested  in  accordance  with
the  section  on  Suitability  of  Test  Equipment  in  SEMI
MF84.  These tests may serve to isolate the cause of the
problem   encountered.      Either   or   both   of   these
components  should  be  repaired  or  replaced  if  they  fail
to  meet  the  requirements  specified  in  this  section  of
SEMI MF84.
NOTE 3:  The  stringent  requirements  on  control  of  probe-tip
spacing as well as the need for off-center diameter correction
factors   required   for   determination   of   radial   resistivity
uniformity  (see  Section  8.5)  are  a  consequence  of  the  single-
configuration   method   of   using   the   four-point   probe   in
accordance   with   SEMI   MF84.      Errors   resulting   from
uncertainty   in   probe-tip   spacing   when   using   the   single-
configuration  method  are  considered  in  Related  Information

2.      The   probe-tip   spacing   requirements   can   be   relaxed
significantly  if  the  dual-configuration  method

of  measuring
resistivity with a four-point probe is used.  Use of this method
is  recommended  for  determination  of  the  radial  resistivity
uniformity    (see    Section    8.5).        However,    the    dual-
configuration  method  has  not  yet  been  standardized  for  bulk
resistivity    measurements    because    appropriate    thickness
correction   factors   have   not   yet   been   published.      Such
corrections  are  required  for  thickness  to  probe  spacing  ratios
greater  than  0.36.    Nevertheless,  it  is  noted  that  the  most

8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for
Resistivity Reference Wafers
8. 1  Factors   that   must   be   considered   in   selecting
materials  for  resistivity  reference  wafers  are  nominal
resistivity   (see   Section   8.2),   wafer   diameter   (see
Section   8.3),   axial   and   radial   uniformity   of   the
resistivity   (see   Sections   8.4   and   8.5,   respectively),
wafer  thickness  (see  8.6),  wafer  conductivity  type  and
surface orientation (see Section 8.7), and surface finish
(see Section 9.1.2).  It is generally desirable to qualify a
crystal  section  for  the  desired  parameters  and  then
verify  that  individual  wafers  meet  the  requirements
during   the   calibration   procedure.      The   uniformity
requirements,   in   particular,   depend   on   the   specific
application  of  the  reference  wafers  because  different
resistivity   measuring   instruments   are   sensitive   to
different volumes of material.
8. 1.1
Four-point  Probes  —  The  most  straightforward
application of resistivity reference wafers is for control
of four-point probes used for measurement of resistivity
and resistivity variation.  If the wafer under test has the
same   geometry   and   surface   characteristics   as   the
reference wafer and if the same probe geometry is used
for the measurement of both the reference wafer and the
wafer  under  test,  the  transfer  is  direct  and  no  special
precautions  need  be  observed.    If  the  wafer  under  test
has  different  thickness  or  diameter  from  the  resistivity
reference  wafer  or  if  four-point  probes  with  different
probe-tip  spacings  are  used  to  measure  the  test  and
reference  wafers,  attention  must  be  paid  to  the  use  of
the  appropriate  correction  factors.    In  particular,  if  the
ratio  of  thickness  to  probe-tip  spacing  becomes  too
large,  (Note  3)  while  the  ratio  of  diameter  to  probe-tip
spacing  becomes  too  small,  second  order  errors  due  to
the use of two two-dimensional corrections for a three-
dimensional geometry may become significant.  Also, if
different  probe-tip  spacings  are  used,  differences  in
sampling  volume  must  be  recognized;  in  this  case,
resistivity  uniformity  of  both  the  reference  wafer  and
the wafer under test limits the transfer accuracy.  If the
wafer  under  test  has  a  different  surface  condition  from
that   of   the   reference   wafer,   it   is   necessary   to
demonstrate     the     equivalence     of     the     resulting
measurement  value  with  that  which  would  have  been
obtained had the same surface condition been employed
for   both.      These   considerations   apply   to   single-

configuration  four-point  probes.    Because  the  standard
test  method  for  use  of  dual-configuration  four-point
probes is intended for sheet resistance, rather than bulk-
resistivity  measurement,  these  concerns  with  thickness
and  diameter  issues  can  be  ignored.    However,  if  the
thickness is too great, an unknown thickness correction
factor  must  be  used  if  bulk  resistivity  values  are  to  be
compared.
8. 1.2
Eddy-current    Gages    —    The    eddy-current
detector  is  sensitive  to  the  integrated  sheet  resistance
across  the  thickness  of  the  wafer;  in  this  respect  it  is
similar  to  the  four-point  probe.    However,  the  eddy-
current   probe   may   weight   various   elements   of   the
volume  sampled  differently  than  that  of  a  four-point
probe.  Therefore, the weighted average resistivity seen
in nonuniform wafers by the eddy current gage may not
be the same as the center-point average resistivity value
determined  by  the  four-point  probe.    As  a  result,  the
accuracy of transfer between these types of instruments
depends  strongly  on  the  macro-scale  uniformity  of  the
resistivity  over  the  central  area  of  the  reference  wafer.
Because  the  eddy-current  gage  is  a  bulk  measurement
device,  the  thickness  uniformity  over  the  area  sampled
by the eddy-current probe is also important.  The upper
limit  of  the  expected  reduction  of  transfer  accuracy  is
given as follows:

in μm.
8. 1.3
Spreading   Resistance   Probes   —   Because   the
spreading  resistance  probe  samples  a  volume  that  is
exceedingly  small  compared  with  the  volume  sampled
by  the  four-point  probe,  the  most  critical  reference
wafer   parameter   for   accurate   transfer   of   resistivity
value   is   the   micro-variation   of   the   resistivity   both
axially   and   radially.      Very   complex   and   time-
consuming  procedures  are  required  to  determine  the
micro-scale depth and lateral variations of resistivity in
a   reference   wafer   (see   Sections   8.4.3   and   8.5.2,


SEMI MF1527-1104 © SEMI 2003, 2004 6
respectively).    Further,  the  procedures  for  determining
micro-scale depth profiles are destructive and cannot be
carried out on the reference wafer itself.  Consequently,
for   this   application   crystals   should   be   grown   by
procedures  that  result  in  the  best  possible  uniformity.
These  include  neutron  transmutation  doping  of  very
high   purity   FZ   crystals   to   obtain   high   resistivity
(neutron  transmutation  doped  (NTD))
n-type  wafers
and magnetic Czochralski (MCz) growth of crystals for
both
n- and p-type wafers.
8. 1.4
Mercury  Probes  —  Similar  conditions  exist  for
reference wafers intended for calibration and control of
mercury  probe  systems  that  are  primarily  used  for
determining  the  net  carrier  density  of  epitaxial  layers
from capacitance measurements.  Such probes sample a
lateral area much smaller than the four-point probe and
a  depth  that  is  only  a  very  tiny  fraction  of  the  wafer
thickness.    To  ensure  that  the  resistivity  in  the  region
sampled  by  the  mercury  probe  can  be  taken  as  the
resistivity   measured   by   the   four-point   probe,   it   is
necessary  to  establish  that  both  the  macro-  and  micro-
scale variations in resistivity of the reference wafer are
within  tolerable  limits.    Thus,  it  is  desirable  to  use
highly uniform crystal such as NTD FZ or MCz crystal
for  resistivity  reference  wafers  for  this  application  (see
Section  8.1.3).    It  is  further  required  in  this  case  to
establish  the  net  carrier  density  of  the  reference  wafer
from the resistivity measurement (see Section 9.2.4).
8. 2
Resistivity —  The  center-point  resistivity  of  the
reference    wafer    should    be    chosen    to    meet    the
requirements   of   the   measuring   instrument   to   be
calibrated or controlled.  Most of the test methods cited
in   Section   1.2   specify   the   resistivity   range   of   the
required resistivity reference wafers.
8. 2.1
Four-point     Probes     —     For     control     of
instrumentation  for  making  four-point  probe  resistivity
measurements  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF84,  it  is
recommended   that   a   minimum   of   three   resistivity
reference  wafers,  with  resistivity  values  in  the  upper,
middle,  and  lower  portions  of  the  resistivity  range  of
interest  be  used  (Note  4).    It  is  preferable  to  use  more
closely  spaced  resistivity  reference  wafers  to  ensure
instrument linearity over the entire measurement range.
If only a narrow resistivity range (less than ±25% of the
nominal value) needs to be measured, it is sufficient to
use  two  resistivity  reference  wafers  at  the  extremes  of
this  range.    Similar  considerations  apply  for  control  of
instrumentation      for      making      sheet      resistance
measurements   in   accordance   with   SEMI   MF1529,
except  that,  in  this  case,  of  course,  the  parameter  of
interest is the sheet resistance rather than the resistivity.
NOTE 4:  For  control  of  instrumentation  for  making  four-
point  probe  measurements  over  a  narrow  resistivity  range,  it
may   be   appropriate   to   use   only   one   or   two   resistivity
reference wafers.
8. 2.2  Eddy–Current  Gages  —  For  calibration  of  eddy
current resistivity measuring instruments, SEMI MF673
specifies that for calibration by Method I, five reference
wafers   that   span   the   full   resistivity   range   of   the
instrument are required.  However, many organizations
prefer  to  use  many  more  reference  wafers  for  the
Method  I  calibration.    Two  resistivity  reference  wafers
at  the  extremes  of  a  narrow  resistivity  range  (typically
less   than   about   ±25   %   of   the   nominal   value)   are
required for Method II calibration.
8. 2.3
Spreading  Resistance  Probes  —  For  calibration
of   spreading   resistance   equipment,   SEMI   MF672
recommends  use  of  at  least  three  resistivity  reference
wafers  per  decade  over  the  range  of  resistivity  to  be
measured.  Regular spacing is desirable, but it may not
be possible to secure samples with adequate uniformity
with  arbitrary  nominal  resistivity  values.    Selection  of
samples    for    micro-scale    uniformity    should    take
precedence over regular spacing.
8. 2.4
Mercury Probes — The resistivity of a resistivity
reference wafer intended for use in calibrating mercury
probe    systems    for    making    net    carrier    density
measurements  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF1392  or
SEMI MF1393 is specified to be between one-half and
two   times   the   resistivity   of   the   specimens   to   be
measured.    However,  there  is  some  benefit  to  employ
several  resistivity  reference  wafers  with  a  range  of
resistivity  from  very  high  (net  carrier  density  less  than
about   1   ×   10
14
cm
−3
)   to   the   lowest   value   to   be
measured.
8. 3
Wafer Diameter — Resistivity reference wafers do
not  need  to  be  the  same  diameter  as  the  wafers  to  be
measured  by  the  system;  any  diameter  that  fits  the
instrumentation and its associated wafer handling is, in
principle,  acceptable.    However,  advances  in  crystal
growing design and control together with certain aspect
ratio  considerations  make  it  likely  that  superior  radial
resistivity  uniformity  in  the  central  region  of  the  wafer
can be obtained with larger diameter (≥100 mm) wafers
as  compared  to  that  of  smaller  diameter  wafers.    In
addition,  the  diameter  correction  factor  for  wafers  100
mm  in  diameter  and  larger  measured  with  a  four-point
probe with probe-tip spacing of 1.59 mm is within 0.2%
of     its     limiting     value     of     π/ln2 ( = 4.5324).
Consequently, errors due to small variations in diameter
or  probe  placement  at  the  wafer  center  are  negligibly
small (see Section R2-3.1), and the second order errors
associated  with  the  combination  of  the  thickness  and
diameter  correction  factors  can  also  be  neglected.    The
latter  point  is  particularly  significant  when  four-point
probes  with  small  probe-tip  spacings  are  employed  on
standard    thickness    wafers    because    the    thickness
