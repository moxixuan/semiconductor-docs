The resolving power of theinstrument near 0.2 micrometer should be no worsethan 10%. The counting efficiency is determined by acalibration at 1  10 5 Pa (1 atmosphere) pressure usingpolystyrene latex spheres in an inert gas and a referenceparticle counter with a proven counting efficiency ofnot less than 95% at 0.2 micrometer.NOTE 2: Suitable test methods for determining countingefficiency and resolving power are contained in JapaneseIndustrial Standard JIS B 9921 (1989), Light ScatteringAutomatic Particle Counter. More sensitive particle countersresult in a higher measured particle concentration. 7 Test MethodNOTE 3: The details of the sampling configuration,measurement procedure, and instrument calibration procedureand frequency, must be agreed upon by the user and supplier,taking into account good engineering practice. Materialsafety data sheets should be referred to for safe handling ofspecialty gases.7.1 Determine the average observed concentration ofcounts in the background ( BX ) by passing nitrogen,believed to be free of particles 0.2 micrometer or morein diameter, through the instrument and recording thetotal number of counts. The nitrogen purge assembly for performing this test, using a filter which removesparticles in this size range, is shown in Figure 1. Counta minimum of 3 equal intervals, each of at least 25standard liters (0.95 SCF), or 30 minutes, whichever isgreater. Calculate BX as defined in Section 4. BXmust not exceed 2 counts per 25 standard liters. Figure 1Schematic Diagram of Configuration for ObtainingParticle Samples from Flammable Specialty GasSystems7.2 The sampling point should be near the point of use,and sampling lines should be clean and as short aspossible.7.3 The sampling system configuration is shown inFigure 1. The specialty gas system should be connectedthrough a sample valve directly to the particle counter,a pressure gauge, and a flow control device (FCD).When sampling is performed using wall tap sampleports, the aspiration efficiency should be checked usingthe method described in Related Information 1. Thesampling system should contain minimum dead volumeand sample tube length. All components in thesampling system should be leak tight and cleaned inaccordance with good engineering practice. A leakcheck of the system should be performed in accordancewith normally accepted practice. The FCD may be partof the particle counter. The particle counter should bemaintained at the pressure of the gas system. The FCDcan be a metering valve and a flow meter or a criticalorifice. The exhaust line should be leak tight and pipedto an appropriate exhaust system. The exhaust linediameter should be large enough to produce no morethan 1  10 4 Pa (1.5 psi) pressure drop during purge andsample flow.NOTE 4: The alternative sampling configurations describedin SEMI C6.3 can also be used for hydrogen.7.4 Using the high purity nitrogen system shown inFigure 1, purge the sampling system and particlecounter for at least 5 minutes at the instrumentmanufacturers specified flow rate. The exact purgetime should take into account the reactivity of the gas

&lt;!-- Page 18 --&gt;

SEMI F23-0697 © SEMI 1997, 20033 and should be sufficient to purge the entire exhaust line.An oxygen sensor should be placed at the systemexhaust to verify less than 1 ppmv oxygen in the purgenitrogen. The purging must be performed beforeflammable gas is introduced into the sampling systemand after completion of the measurement. The valveleading to the oxygen sensor should be closed whenflammable gas is being sampled. The valve leadingfrom the purge nitrogen system should be closed whensampling specialty gases and/or a back flow preventiondevice should be included in the purge nitrogen system.NOTE 5: It is known that flammable gases can react withoxygen present in the sampling system. Nitrogen purging ofthe sampling system reduces the risk of reaction. The purityof the purge nitrogen should be sufficient to remove reactivesubstances from the sampling system.7.5 Count the particles in each of at least 3 equalintervals. Each sample interval must be at least 25standard liters (0.95 SCF), or 30 minutes, whichever isgreater. Data obtained during the first 5 minutes afterthe sample valve is opened may be discarded. Recordthe number of counts in the sample volume for eachinterval. Calculate CX and S C, as defined in Section 4.NOTE 6: For small volume specialty gas systems, the userand supplier may agree to a smaller sample gas volume thanthat stated above. The sample point location and the processline pressure and flow rate during the test should be recorded. 8 Report8.1 The report shall contain the values of all thevariables defined in Section 4. 9 Related DocumentsHart, J.

Determination of the suitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user. R1-1 IntroductionR1-1.1 Isokinetic sample probes are usually notprovided in speciality gas systems. Particle sampling isusually performed using wall tap sample ports. Walltap sample ports are oriented 90 to the process lineflow as shown in Figure R1-1. Non-isokinetic flow intothe sample tube results from the 90 change in flowdirection. Additional deviation from isokinesis canresult from stream tube contraction or expansion whenthe velocities U and v are not equal. The effects ofnon-isokinetic flow on the measurement should bechecked. The particle sampling process should beperformed with an aspiration efficiency close to 1.

The resolving power of theinstrument near 0.2 micrometer should be no worsethan 10%. The counting efficiency is determined by acalibration at 1  10 5 Pa (1 atmosphere) pressure usingp olystyrene latex spheres in an inert gas and areference particle counter with a proven countingefficiency of not less than 95% at 0.2 micrometer.NOTE 2: Suitable test methods for determining countingefficiency and resolving power are contained in JapaneseIndustrial Standard JIS B 9921 (1989), Light ScatteringAutomatic Particle Counter. More sensitive particle countersresult in a higher measured particle concentration. 7 Test MethodNOTE 3: The details of the sampling configuration,measurement procedure, and instrument calibration procedureand frequency must be agreed upon by the user and supplier,taking into account good engineering practice. Materialsafety data sheets should be referred to for safe handling ofspecialty gases.7.1 Determine the average observed concentration ofcounts in the background ( BX ) by passing nitrogen,believed to be free of particles 0.2 micrometer or more in diameter, through the instrument and recording thetotal number of counts. The nitrogen purge assemblyfor performing this test, using a filter which removesparticles in this size range, is shown in Figure 1. Counta minimum of 3 equal intervals, each of at least 25standard liters (0.95 SCF), or 30 minutes, whichever isgreater. Calculate BX as defined in Section 4. BXmust not exceed 2 counts per 25 standard liters. Figure 1Schematic Diagram of Configuration forObtaining Particle Samples from Inert SpecialtyGas Systems7.2 The sampling point should be near the point of use,and sampling lines should be clean and as short aspossible.7.3 The sampling system configuration is shown inFigure 1. The specialty gas system should be connectedthrough a sample valve directly to the particle counter,a pressure gauge, and a flow control device (FCD).When sampling is performed using wall tap sampleports, the aspiration efficiency should be checked usingthe method described in Related Information 1. Thesampling system should contain minimum dead volumeand sample tube length. All components in thesampling system should be leak tight and cleaned inaccordance with good engineering practice. A leakcheck of the system should be performed in accordancewith normally accepted practice. The FCD may be partof the particle counter. The particle counter should bemaintained at the pressure of the gas system. The FCDcan be a metering valve and a flow meter or a criticalorifice. The exhaust line should be leak tight and pipedto an appropriate exhaust system. The exhaust linediameter should be large enough to produce no morethan 1  10 4 Pa (1.5 psi) pressure drop during purge andsample flow.NOTE 4: The alternative sampling configurations describedin SEMI C6.5 can also be used for nitrogen or argon.7.4 Using the high purity nitrogen system shown inFigure 1, purge the sampling system and particle

The purging must be performed before sample gasis introduced into the sampling system and aftercompletion of the measurement. The valve leadingfrom the purge nitrogen system should be closed whensampling specialty gases and/or a back flow preventiondevice should be included in the purge nitrogen system.7.5 Count the particles in each of at least 3 equalintervals. Each sample interval must be at least 25standard liters (0.95 SCF), or 30 minutes, whichever isgreater. Data obtained during the first 5 minutes afterthe sample valve is opened may be discarded. Recordthe number of counts in the sample volume for eachinterval. Calculate CX and S C, as defined in Section 4.NOTE 5: For small volume specialty gas systems, the userand supplier may agree to a smaller sample gas volume thanthat stated above. The sample point location and the processline pressure and flow rate during the test should be recorded. 8 Report8.1 The report shall contain the values of all thevariables defined in Section 4. 9 Related DocumentsHart, J.

Determination of the suitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user. R1-1 IntroductionR1-1.1 Isokinetic sample probes are usually notprovided in speciality gas systems. Particle sampling isusually performed using wall tap sample ports. Walltap sample ports are oriented 90 to the process lineflow as shown in Figure R1-1. Non-isokinetic flow intothe sample tube results from the 90 change in flowdirection. Additional deviation from isokinesis canresult from stream tube contraction or expansion whenthe velocities U and v are not equal. The effects ofnon-isokinetic flow on the measurement should bechecked. The particle sampling process should beperformed with an aspiration efficiency close to 1.

The resolving power of theinstrument near 0.2 micrometer should be no worsethan 10%. The counting efficiency is determined by acalibration at 1  10 5 Pa (1 atmosphere) pressure usingpolystyrene latex spheres in an inert gas and a referenceparticle counter with a proven counting efficiency ofnot less than 95% at 0.2 micrometer.NOTE 2: Suitable test methods for determining countingefficiency and resolving power are contained in JapaneseIndustrial Standard JIS B 9921 (1989), Light ScatteringAutomatic Particle Counter. More sensitive particle countersresult in a higher measured particle concentration. 7 Test MethodNOTE 3: The details of the sampling configuration,measurement procedure, and instrument calibration procedureand frequency must be agreed upon by the user and supplier,taking into account good engineering practice. Materialsafety data sheets should be referred to for safe handling ofspecialty gases.7.1 Determine the average observed concentration ofcounts in the background ( BX ) by passing nitrogen,believed to be free of particles 0.2 micrometer or morein diameter, through the instrument and recording thetotal number of counts. The nitrogen purge assembly for performing this test, using a filter which removesparticles in this size range, is shown in Figure 1. Counta minimum of 3 equal intervals, each of at least 25standard liters (0.95 SCF), or 30 minutes, whichever isgreater. Calculate BX as defined in Section 4. BXmust not exceed 2 counts per 25 standard liters. 8 Figure 1Schematic Diagram of Configuration forObtaining Particle Samples from Toxic SpecialtyGas Systems 7.2 The sampling point should be near the point of use,and sampling lines should be clean and as short aspossible.7.3 The sampling system configuration is shown inFigure 1. The specialty gas system should be connectedthrough a sample valve directly to the particle counter,a pressure gauge, and a flow control device (FCD).When sampling is performed using wall tap sampleports, the aspiration efficiency should be checked usingthe method described in Related Information 1. Thesampling system should contain minimum dead volumeand sample tube length. All components in thesampling system should be leak tight and cleaned inaccordance with good engineering practice. A leakcheck of the system should be performed in accordancewith normally accepted practice. The FCD may be partof the particle counter. The particle counter should bemaintained at the pressure of the gas system. The FCDcan be a metering valve and a flow meter or a criticalorifice. The exhaust line should be leak tight and pipedto an appropriate exhaust system. The exhaust linediameter should be large enough to produce no morethan 1  10 4 Pa (1.5 psi) pressure drop during purge andsample flow.7.4 Using the high purity nitrogen system shown inFigure 1, purge the sampling system and particlecounter for at least 5 minutes at the instrumentmanufacturers specified flow rate. The exact purgetime should take into account the reactivity of the gasand should be sufficient to purge the entire exhaust line.A moisture sensor should be placed at the systemexhaust to verify less than 1 ppmv water in the purge

The valve leading tothe moisture sensor should be closed when toxic gas isbeing sampled. The valve leading from the purgenitrogen system should be closed when samplingspecialty gases and/or a back flow prevention deviceshould be included in the purge nitrogen system.NOTE 4: It is known that toxic gases may produce injuriousor lethal effects. Nitrogen purging of the sampling systemreduces the risk of exposure to toxic gases. The purity of thepurge nitrogen should be sufficient to remove reactivesubstances from the sampling system.7.5 Count the particles in each of at least 3 equalintervals. Each sample interval must be at least 25standard liters (0.95 SCF), or 30 minutes, whichever isgreater. Data obtained during the first 5 minutes afterthe sample valve is opened may be discarded. Recordthe number of counts in the sample volume for eachinterval. Calculate CX and SC, as defined in Section 4.NOTE 5: For small volume specialty gas systems, the userand supplier may agree to a smaller sample gas volume thanthat stated above. The sample point location and the processline pressure and flow rate during the test should be recorded. 8 Report8.1 The report shall contain the values of all thevariables defined in Section 4. 9 Related DocumentsHart, J.

Determination of the suitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user. R1-1 IntroductionR1-1.1 Isokinetic sample probes are usually notprovided in speciality gas systems. Particle sampling isusually performed using wall tap sample ports. Walltap sample ports are oriented 90 to the process lineflow as shown in Figure R1-1. Non-isokinetic flow intothe sample tube results from the 90 change in flowdirection. Additional deviation from isokinesis canresult from stream tube contraction or expansion whenthe velocities U and v are not equal. The effects ofnon-isokinetic flow on the measurement should bechecked. The particle sampling process should beperformed with an aspiration efficiency close to 1.

SEMI F27-0997 © SEMI 1997, 20031 SEMI F27-0997 (Reapproved 1103)TEST METHOD FOR MOISTURE INTERACTION AND CONTENT OFGAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS BYATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE IONIZATION MASS SPECTROMETRY(APIMS) This test method was technically reapproved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on September 16, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org October 2003; to bepublished November 2003. Originally published September 1997. 1 Purpose1.1 This test will determine the quantity of removablemoisture and the degree of interaction with traceconcentrations of gas phase moisture, of gasdistribution systems and components. APIMS iscurrently the technique of choice for such tests becauseit is essentially the only commercially available methodcapable of ppt moisture analysis and because of itssuperior response time. This method may provideguidelines for the application of other techniques withsimilar detection limits and response time to APIMSwhich are not commercially available at this time.1.2 The results of this test can be used for qualitativeranking of systems and components and can also beused, by a sufficiently sophisticated user, as input fornumerical simulation of distribution system behavior. 2 Scope2.1 System and Component Types  This procedureapplies to in-line components to be used to containelectronics grade materials in semiconductor gasdistribution systems. The following components areexpected to yield meaningful results when testedaccording to the present method: tubing, connectors(fittings), particle filters, valves (check, relief, shut-off,and metering), regulators, flow-throughtransducers/sensors, mass flow controllers and meters.Components with dead volumes, such as pressuregauges, can be tested according to this method, but theresults will be difficult to interpret. Additional criteriabesides those considered here need to be developed fortesting components with dead volumes.2.1.1 As gas phase moisture levels are dominated bydesorption from surfaces, the procedure is expected tobe most useful for components of large surface areasuch as particle filters and tubing. Components withvery small wetted surface areas may have moistureinteractions which are too small to measure using thistest. Check valves and relief valves can be tested only iftheir operating parameters are consistent with the testconditions. 2.1.2 Tubing samples must be rather long (34 m) toyield useful results, but they can be bent into a U shapein order to be accommodated into a practical test bench.Radii of curvature should be no less than 6 times theinternal diameter of the tube and the minimum numberof bends should be used. Most ultra-high puritycomponents are currently supplied with metal gasketconnectors, so the test bench employed should be fittedwith mating connectors. This type of fitting is usuallywelded to tubing, which is not recommended as itintroduces a potential source of uncontrolled variabilityto the experiments. Instead, a compression fitting on thetube and a suitable adapter should be used. Thecompression fitting should not be disconnected afterinitial connection until the test series is over. In thisway, deterioration in integrity of the connection can beavoided. The same type of gasket to compression fittingadapter should be used for all tubing samples.2.1.3 Purifiers require special test procedures and arenot addressed here.2.1.4 Simple systems consisting of componentsconnected in line can be tested by the present method.Complex systems (i.e., those with more than onepotential inlet and/or outlet) will show performancewhich varies depending on the test configuration(which inlets and outlets are chosen). Testing of suchsystems is not addressed by the current document.2.2 Gases  The procedure will be carried out innitrogen. The results will provide a ranking with respectto moisture contribution which may be applied with duecaution to components intended for use in other gasstreams. Other inert gases will have different purgingcharacteristics and may dry a component more quicklyor slowly. Reactive gases may react chemically withmoisture. Considerations relating to corrosionresistance are outside the scope of the presentdocument, although the test procedure may prove usefulin corrosion studies.2.3 Operating Situations  Moisture contribution froma component may be the result of contamination arisingin its manufacture, or from subsequent exposure to

&lt;!-- Page 37 --&gt;

SEMI F27-0997 © SEMI 1997, 2003 2 ambient air or non-dry gas. Thus, it is necessary toconsider two main situations:1. The initial dry-down situation, which isdetermined by the moisture content of thecomponent as received with the effects ofmanufacturing process and design, surface quality,pretreatment and packaging convoluted together.2. The Response to upset situation, which isdetermined by the amount of moisture taken up bythe component and subsequently released in anyexposure after receipt.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This test method allows the determination ofmoisture interactions which can be used, for example,to rank components in order of decreasing moistureinteraction. Because different degrees of moistureinteraction are desirable in different situations, selectingthe best components requires consideration of howthey will be used in a given distribution system, eitherqualitatively or through numerical simulation ofdistribution system behavior. 4 Referenced Standard4.1 SEMI StandardSEMI C15  Test Method for ppm and ppb HumidityStandardsNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Acronyms and Abbreviations5.1.1 APIMS  Atmospheric Pressure Ionization MassSpectrometry5.1.2 EPSS  Electropolished Stainless Steel5.1.3 MFC  Mass Flow Controller5.1.4 ppm  molar parts per million (mole/mole).The same as ppmv. 5.1.5 ppb  molar parts per billion (nmole/mole). Thesame as ppbv.5.1.6 ppt  molar parts per trillion (pimole/mole). Thesame as pptv.5.2 Definitions5.2.1 induction time  the elapsed time between whenhumidified gas is input to the test component and whenmoisture is detected at the moisture analyzer. For acomponent and test system which are perfectlytransparent to moisture the induction time is equal tothe residence time of the gas in the system.5.2.2 peak height  the maximum moistureconcentration recorded when a moisture input ofpredefined length and concentration is introduced to atest component. 6 Required Equipment6.1 APIMS  The APIMS used for moisture detectioncan be of any type. In order to be considered valid, anyseries of moisture tests shall reference two single pointcalibrations, one at the beginning and one at the end ofthe series. These calibrations shall both be made underthe same analytical conditions (flow, pressures, platevoltages, etc.) as the tests and the results shall be within5% of each other. Provided this condition is met, theinterval between calibrations may be left to thediscretion of the operator; however, it is suggested thatcalibration should be carried out whenever theequipment is moved and/or every two weeks ofoperation.6.2 Dry Gas and Moisture Generator  A source ofextremely dry nitrogen (less than 100 ppt moisture) anda moisture generator capable of delivering up to 13 slmnitrogen doped with 50 ppb moisture is required. Thisgenerator may be the same as used to calibrate theAPIMS. The output of the generator shall be verifiedaccording to SEMI C15.6.2.1 Most ultra-high purity components are currentlyfitted with metal gasket type connectors. The same typeof connector should, therefore, be incorporated into thetest bench for connection to the test components.6.3 Test Blank  Any series of tests shall include theresults of testing a blank. The blank shall be the shortestconvenient length (no more than 1 m) of 1/4"electropolished stainless steel (EPSS) tubing withsuitable fittings and/or adapters at either end to enable itto be inserted in place of the test specimen.

&lt;!-- Page 38 --&gt;

SEMI F27-0997 © SEMI 1997, 20033 6.4 Moisture Pulse Generator  A valving arrangement capable of switching rapidly between dry and humidifiednitrogen is also required. An example of such a design is shown in Figure 1. In this design, flow is maintained inboth the humidified and dry gas lines at all times. By simultaneously switching valves V 1 and V3, or V 2 and V3,either humidified or dry gas is directed through the test specimen while the other gas stream is directed to vent. Notethat there is a bypass loop so that flow can be maintained to the APIMS when the specimen is removed. In thisdesign, all gas lines, but especially those lines between V1 and V 3 and between V 2 and V3, should be as short aspossible and constructed of EPSS tubing of high quality. Maintaining gas lines at a constant temperature between 50and 80C wherever possible is also recommended. Figure 1Moisture Test Schematic 6.4.1 The bypass loop will contain a stagnant volume of gas during testing. To avoid exposing the APIMS to a largemoisture upset whenever it is fed the gas contained in the bypass loop, the loop should be thoroughly baked out (at ≥200C) and protected from atmospheric contamination thereafter. Valve V4 should be such that some flow can bemaintained through the bypass loop and the test specimen simultaneously as well as through each separately. Use ofpneumatic valves to facilitate rapid and simultaneous switching is recommended.6.4.2 Other arrangements than that shown may also be used. The moisture pulse generator should be designed so asto give the fastest possible response of the blank to a change in input moisture level.6.4.3 Use of a glove box or other such enclosure about the test specimen and adjacent piping, to minimize exposureof the system to ambient contamination when removing and introducing the test specimen, will improve theprecision of moisture content measurements but not of moisture interaction measurements. Use of such an enclosureis, therefore, left to the discretion of the operator.6.5 Temperature Control and Measurement  A stable temperature during the test is of critical importance. Thetest component shall be kept at 35C. TESTS AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES CANNOT BECOMPARED. Ideally, the blank and device under test should be maintained in a temperature-controlled chamber.However, if this is impractical, heating tape can be used. Temperature shall be measured at 1 m intervals on tubing.Measurement at one point is adequate for small components. Temperature control should be to ± 1C. A continuousrecord of temperature during the test shall be maintained. 7 Procedure7.1 Blank Tests  A blank test shall be carried out after each calibration. If initial dry-down testing of componentsis not of interest, the initial dry-down test of the test blank may be omitted and the test blank brought to equilibriumwith zero gas in whatever manner is most convenient, except that the test blank should not be heated above 200C.Permanent changes in moisture interaction have been observed at temperatures above this level.

SEMI F27-0997 © SEMI 1997, 2003 4 7.1.1 Initial Dry Down  Start the experiment with theblank in place of the test specimen and a flow of drygas through the APIMS. The APIMS output should beat equilibrium with the lowest moisture level of interest,and in any case no higher than 500 ppt. The flow ratethrough the test blank should be set according to theFlow Table (see Table 1).7.1.1.1 Switch the gas flow to pass primarily throughthe bypass loop while maintaining a small flow throughthe test blank. Remove the test blank completely fromthe system. If a glove box or other such enclosure isused, do not remove the test blank from the glove box.Immediately reconnect the test blank to V4, leaving itdisconnected from V5. Allow dry nitrogen to flowthrough the test blank for five minutes to purge the airfrom inside before reconnecting to V5. Switch the gas toflow only through the blank and not through the bypassloop. The APIMS will show an increase in moistureconcentration. Record the APIMS output until itreaches 500 ppt or for 24 hours, whichever is less.7.1.1.2 Repeat the above test twice for a total of threedata sets.7.1.2 Moisture Input Test  After the APIMS hasreturned to equilibrium with its initial moisture level,switch the input gas to 50 ppb moisture (by switchingvalves V 1, V 2, and V3 simultaneously, if thearrangement of Figure 1 is used) while recording theAPIMS response. Maintain this moisture input for 20minutes. Switch the input to the test blank back to drynitrogen and record the decease in moisture level untilthe initial background is again reached.7.1.2.1 Repeat the above test twice for a total of threedata sets.7.2 Tests on Actual Specimen7.2.1 Initial Dry Down  This portion of the test isdesigned to determine the quantity of removablemoisture on the wetted surfaces of a component in thecondition in which it is typically supplied. Thus, theresults of this test will reflect, by design, anyprecautions which the supplier has taken to removemoisture and maintain its dryness during shipping.7.2.1.1 Start the test as in Section 7.1.1. The testspecimen should not be unpacked until after the APIMShas equilibrated with the background moisture level. Ifa glove box or other such enclosure is used, unpack thecomponent in the glove box. Switch the dry nitrogenflow to pass through the bypass loop while maintaininga small component through the test blank. Undo thefinal layer of packing and any shipping caps or plugs onthe component at this point. Remove the sample blankand connect the test specimen to valve V4 as quickly aspossible. Allow the dry nitrogen flow to purge out any ambient air in the specimen for five minutes, thenconnect the specimen to V5. Switch the gas to flow onlythrough the test specimen and not through the bypassloop. The APIMS will show an increase in moistureconcentration. Record the APIMS output until itreaches 500 ppt or for 24 hours, whichever is less.7.2.1.2 After 24 hours, the dry-down part of the testcan be terminated. If necessary, the moisture level canbe reduced below 500 ppt by baking the component at200C or the maximum temperature allowed by themanufacturer for six hours and/or purging at the highestflow of dry gas available. If this is not sufficient toreduce the moisture concentration below 500 ppt, thetest may be abandoned.7.2.2 Moisture Input Test  After the APIMS hasreturned to equilibrium with its initial moisture level,switch the input gas to 50 ppb moisture (by switchingvalves V 1, V 2, and V3 simultaneously, if thearrangement of Figure 1 is used) while recording theAPIMS response. Maintain this moisture input for 20minutes. Switch the input to the test blank back to drynitrogen and record the decease in moisture level untilthe initial background is again reached.7.2.2.1 Repeat the above test twice for a total of threedata sets.7.2.2.2 In case the moisture level recorded by theAPIMS does not reach 50 ppb within 20 minutes, anadditional test should be performed in which themoisture input should be continued until equilibrium isreached. Then switch the input to the test specimenback to dry nitrogen and record the decease in moisturelevel until the initial background is again reached.This test should be repeated once (two data sets total).7.2.3 Bake-Out Test  Heat component to maximumbake temperature, according to manufacturersspecifications, for three hours. Allow it to return toroom temperature. Continue by repeating the moistureinput test, after baking, as in Section 7.2.2.7.3 Temperature, Flow Rate, and PressureSpecification  The recommended test pressure is 700kPa (7 bar). However, lower test pressures areappropriate for some models of APIMS. Also, themaximum pressure rating of the test components shouldnot be exceeded. The component temperature shall bemaintained at 35 ± 1C during the test.7.3.1 In the case of tubing, the test shall be carried outat a single flow determined by the tubing diameteraccording to the following table. In the case of valves,regulators, mass flow controllers (MFCs), and passivecomponents (gauges, flow meters, and fittings), the testwill be carried out at a single flow determined by thetable according to the size of the connecting tube stubs.

&lt;!-- Page 40 --&gt;

SEMI F27-0997 © SEMI 1997, 20035 Regulators should be tested in the fully-open condition(i.e., with the regulator adjusted for minimum pressuredrop). The quantity of published data on regulatorinteraction with moisture is limited, and experiments toinvestigate the effect of varying the pressure dropacross the regulator are encouraged but are not part ofthis test. MFCs should be tested with a flow controldevice upstream and the MFC not actively controllingthe flow through it (usually referred to as the purgesetting). It may not be possible to test a given MFC atthe specified flow if the flow rating of the MFC is muchless than the specified flow. As MFCs are not expectedto vary greatly in performance according to their flowrating, MFCs to be tested should generally be chosento be compatible with the table. If this is not possible,then the MFC should be tested at its rated flow (lowerthan the flow in the table). This can then be considereda conservative test, as the MFC operated at higher flowwould be expected to dry down more quickly.7.3.2 Particle filters with the same size tubingconnectors often have somewhat different sizes andvery different flow ratings. In order to be able to makereasonable comparisons between the performance ofdifferent filters, it is essential to test filters of similiarsize at the same flow. However, the flow dependence ofthe moisture response of particle filters is morecomplex than that of tubing, and they must be tested atmore than one flow in order to model their behavior. Inorder to meet this requirement and provide data whichcan be readily compared with the conditions underwhich the filters can be expected to be used in practice,filters shall be tested at two flows: The first, accordingto the size of the connecting tube stubs, the second, tobe 25% of the rated flow of the filter or 50 slm,whichever is less.7.3.3 For systems of components, the system shall betested at the lowest flow of those determined for eachcomponent in the system considered separately. If thesystem includes a filter, it shall be tested at that flowand additionally, at 25% of the rated flow of the filter or50 slm, whichever is less.Table 1 Flow RateTubing Outer Diameter(nominal)Flow (allcomponents)Flow for SecondTest on Filters≥ 1/8", &lt; 1/2"(≥ 3.2 mm, &lt; 12.7 mm)6 slm ≥ 1/2"(≥ 12.7 mm)13 slm 25% of rated flowor 50 slmwhichever is less 8 Reporting Results8.1 Complete moisture response curves for all testspecimens and relevant test blanks should be included.

SEMI F28-1103 © SEMI 1997, 20031 SEMI F28-1103TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING PARTICLE GENERATION FROMPROCESS PANELS This test method was technically approved by the Global GasesCommittee and is the direct responsibility ofthe North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on September 25, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org October 2003; to be publishedNovember 2003. Originally published September 1997. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this document is to define a methodfor testing process panels intended for installation inhigh-purity gas distribution systems. Application of thistest method is expected to yield comparable data amongprocess panels tested for the purposes of qualificationfor this installation.1.2 This document describes a test method designed todraw comparisons of particulate generationperformance of process panels. This test methodevaluates the cleanliness of process panels in the asreceived condition as well as under normal operatingconditions. The as received test is intended to enablethe user to evaluate the fabrication, cleaning, andpackaging techniques of the manufacturer of theprocess panel. The test under actual operatingconditions is intended to allow the user to evaluate themanufacturers component selection as well as thequality of the panel design. The specific flow ratesdescribed in both test methods are representative ofrelatively high flow conditions for a typical processpanel. 2 Scope2.1 This test method addresses total particle countsgreater than the minimum detection limit (MDL) of theparticle counter and does not consider classifying datainto various size ranges.2.2 This procedure utilizes a particle counter applied toprocess panels typically used in semiconductorapplications. It applies to process gas supply systems(e.g., gas cabinets) which include a process panel, aninert purge panel, and a system vent. Both automaticand manual process panels are within the scope of thistest procedure. Panels, as defined in this test method,are considered to consist of 6.35 mm O. D.  0.89 mmwall (1/4" O.D.  0.035" wall) tubing and components.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This test method specifies flow and mechanicalstress conditions considered typical of conditions whichwould be expected under moderately aggressiveoperating conditions. These conditions should notexceed those recommended by the manufacturer.Actual performance under operating conditions at lowerflow rates or less aggressive conditions may differ.

The tubingshall have an average surface roughness of 0.25micrometer (10 microinch) Ra or less. Electropolishedtubing (as defined in SEMI F16) is recommended.6.2.7 Sampler  The sampling system consists of adiffuser equipped with a pressure reducing device (e.g.,critical orifice) and a sample probe. All parts of thesampling system are to be electropolished with asurface roughness of 0.25 micrometer (10 microinch)Ra or less. If a critical orifice is to be used for pressurereduction, it is not required to be electropolished. Thediffuser and sample probe must be sized to obtainisokinetic sampling at the specified test conditions. Thecritical orifice must be sized to obtain the specifiedpanel pressure at the specified test flow rate.6.2.8 Spool Piece  Spool pieces shall be electro-polished 316L stainless steel tubing with a surface finish of 0.25 micrometer (10 microinch) Ra or better.The spool piece is to be installed in the system in placeof the test device while obtaining background countsfor the system.6.2.9 Fittings  Use face seal connectors orcompression fittings depending on test panel endconnections.6.2.10 Gaskets  Use non-plated metal gaskets whererequired.6.2.11 A CNC capable of detecting particles at least assmall as 0.02 m at a 50% efficiency envelope asdefined by ISO 14644, with a sampling flow rate of1.23 SLPM (0.05 scfm) or greater, is to be used forparticle counting.

A continuous low flow is to bemaintained to purge the system. The particle counter may be turned off. For an extended shutdown, the system(excluding the CNC) should be pressurized and capped.6.2.11.5 After initial construction, the spool piece should be installed and the system should be cleaned up byrunning a high-flow rate of test gas (&gt; 60 SLPM) and gently tapping all components (except the CNC) downstreamof the final filter. This procedure should be followed by a start-up phase which characterizes system cleanliness byconducting the entire test protocol with the spool piece installed.6.3 Test ProceduresNOTE 2: Ensure the counter is counting continuously and reporting data each minute. For the duration of the test, the countershould be continuously counting, except where noted in the test protocol.6.3.1 This test method classifies panels into three pressure ranges: high, medium, and low.

SEMI F28-1103 © SEMI 1997, 20035 6.3.1.1 The test flow rates stated in the above table aremeant to serve as a general guideline. The actual testflow rates may vary depending on the maximum panelflow rate as recommended by the manufacturer. Themaximum test flow rate should be the manufacturersmaximum recommended flow rate. If no suchmaximum flow rate is recommended by themanufacturer, the flow rates in the above table shouldbe used.6.3.2 Background Test  Ensure that all valvesdepicted in Figure 1 are in the closed position. Connectthe spool piece to the purge gas inlet (C-2) and theisokinetic sampler inlet. Ensure that the spool piece andproper adapters are in place on the test apparatus. (C-1should be capped at this time.)6.3.2.1 Close valve V-3. Adjust the regulator (PCV-2)until PI-5 indicates the appropriate pressure in Table 1.Open valve V-3 and use FC-2 to establish the specifiedtest flow rate listed in Table 1. Measure the staticbackground count. Background count is establishedwhen the counter has sampled a minimum of 74 SL (3scf), and the arithmetic average during the last 74 SL (3scf) of gas sampled is &lt; 71 particles/m3 (&lt; 2particles/scf). At a sample flow rate of 1.23 SLPM(0.05 scfm), the time required is one hour. Ensure thatthe background counts are stable or decreasing. Ifbackground cannot be achieved after 147 SL (6 scf)have been sampled, there may be a problem with thecounter or test apparatus.6.3.2.2 Disconnect the spool piece from C-2 andconnect it to C-1. Cap C-2 at this point.6.3.2.3 Open valve V-1 and close valve V-2. Adjust theregulator (PCV-1) until PI-2 indicates the appropriatesupply pressure listed in Table 1. Open valves V-1 andV-2 to establish flow. Using the flow control device(FC-1) set the appropriate test flow rate listed in Table1. Measure the static background count. Backgroundcount is established when the counter has sampled aminimum of 74 SL (3 scf), and the arithmetic averageduring the last 74 SL (3 scf) of gas sampled is &lt; 71particles/m3 (&lt; 2 particles/scf). At a sample flow rate of1.23 SLPM (0.05 scfm), the time required is one hour.Ensure that the background counts are stable ordecreasing. If background cannot be achieved after 147SL (6 scf) have been sampled, there may be a problemwith the counter or test apparatus.6.3.2.4 Actuate valve V-2 at 1 cycle per minute tomeasure the background counts under dynamic testconditions. Dynamic background count is establishedwhen the counter has sampled a minimum of 74 SL (3scf), and the arithmetic average during the last 74 SL (3scf) of gas sampled is &lt; 106 particles/m3 (&lt; 3particles/scf). At a sample flow rate of 1.23 SLPM (0.05 scfm), the time required is 1 hour. If dynamicbackground cannot be achieved after 147 SL (6 scf)have been sampled, there may be a problem with thecounter or test apparatus.6.3.3 Static Test  Using the flow control device (FC-1), decrease the flow rate to 2.55.0 SLPM (0.10.2scfm), so that some flow remains in the system whilethe test component is installed.6.3.3.1 Remove the spool piece by first disconnectingthe downstream fitting and then the upstream fitting.Immediately install the test panel with all of the processvalves in the fully-open position by first connecting theprocess gas inlet (C-3) fitting and then the processoutlet fitting. Uncap C-2 and connect it to the purge gasinlet (C-4) connection of the panel with V-3 in theclosed condition. In order to minimize atmosphericcontamination and prevent the counter from cooling off,removal of the spool piece and installation of the testpanel should take no longer than 2 minutes. Extremecare should be taken to minimize contamination of thetest apparatus during this operation. The test panel is tobe removed from its inner bag in the Class 100 testarea. If the process outlet connection of the test panelhas mechanical fittings, these fittings are to be properlyconnected. If the process outlet has butt weld tubestubs, the connection is to be made with cleancompression fittings. Do not permanently crimp anyferrules onto the tube stubs. Nylon ferrules areacceptable. The purge gas inlet connection (C-4) shouldalso be connected at this time. The outlet ventconnection should be capped at this time. If thisconnection is not capped by the manufacturer, it shouldbe covered with Aclar or Nylon 66 squares and taped soas to insure against contamination by the immediateenvironment. If applicable, all pneumatic valves shouldbe connected using the maximum recommendedactuator pressure as specified by the manufacturer.6.3.3.2 Adjust the panels process regulator to obtainthe appropriate process outlet pressure as indicated inTable 1. Using the flow control device (FC-1), increasethe flow to obtain the appropriate test flow rate asindicated in Section 6.3.1.16.3.3.3 Turn on the counter and conduct the steadystate test. All of the valves on the process panel are tobe tested in a fully-open position until 74 SL (3 scf) ofgas have been sampled. Cumulative data should berecorded at one-minute intervals.NOTE 3: The flow rates in Table 1 represent the maximumtest flow rates. If a more thorough test is desired, the staticportion of the test should be repeated at intervals of 20%,40%, 60%, and 80% of the full test flow rate. Testing at thelower flow rates may in some instances be more indicative ofpanel performance under actual use conditions.

SEMI F28-1103 © SEMI 1997, 2003 6 6.3.4 Dynamic Test  This test is to immediatelyfollow the static test. To conduct the dynamic test,actuate the panels final process outlet valve at the rateof 1 cycle/minute for 60 minutes. Each cycle consists ofhaving the valve in the open position for 58 secondsand in the closed position for 2 seconds.6.3.5 Cylinder Change Test  Close V-2, open V-3and V-4, and adjust PCV-2 until PI-5 reads 3450 Kpag(500 psig). Adjust the flow rate and pressure to thevacuum venturi using FC-3 and PCV-3. The flow rateand pressure should be set to the manufacturersrecommended values. Next perform a simulatedcylinder change purge and evacuation sequencefollowing the valve sequencing, dwell times, pressuresettings, etc. as specified by the manufacturer.6.3.6 Final Steady State Test  Close V-4, V-3, andopen V-2. Repeat the step in Section 6.3.3.3.6.3.7 Unregulated Flow Test (optional)  In someinstances, it may be desirable to test the panel with itsregulator in the fully-open position. Such a test willgive an indication of panel particulate performancewithout the additional contribution of particles from anoperating regulator. In this instance, steps 6.36.3.5should be repeated with the regulator in the wide opencondition.6.4 Data Analysis and Reporting  The following testconditions are to be reported in the data presentation:1. Date and time of test2. Operator3. Test flow rate4.Test pressures5. Panel type, manufacturer, and serial number6. Particle counter manufacturer, serial number, sampleflow rate, model number, specified particle sizesensitivity, and calibration date7. Test gas type and dew point8. A schematic of the test apparatus, includingmanufacturers and model numbers of all testapparatus components9. Calibration dates for all instrumentation. 6.4.1 Data Presentation  Graph the static anddynamic portions of the test separately as counts/minute(measured by the counter) versus time, including theappropriate background (measured with the spool piecein place) with each. Also graph the entire data set ascounts per minute versus time. 6.4.1.1 Present the entire raw data set in tabular form.6.4.2 Data Reduction  The statistical analysis isbased on the assumption that the particles generated arerandomly distributed and are statistically independentof each other. The background counts are independentof the particle performance of the component. Theparticle counts observed from the test include thecounts from the component and the background count.Let: X B = average background particle countX t = average total particle count from testX c = average particle count generated by the test component Therefore, Xt = X c + X B 6.4.2.1 A statistical analysis of the data is performed todetermine the mean, standard deviation, and thestandard error for each particle size range.6.4.2.2 The sample mean, X, or average of the data foreach state is given by: X = Xini = 1n where Xi is the observed counts for the state and n is thenumber of samples.6.4.2.3 The sample standard deviation is a measure ofthe variability of the data about the mean. The standarddeviation, s, for each state is expressed as: s = (Xi  X)2i =1nn  1 6.4.2.4 The standard error, Se or standard deviation ofthe sampling distribution of the mean for each state isgiven below: Se = sn 6.4.2.5 The average particle count for the total numberof particles generated, or the sample mean, is anestimation of the population mean. For a 95%confidence level, the population mean, p, will bewithin two standard errors of the sample mean, or: p = X ± 2 Se

SEMI F28-1103 © SEMI 1997, 20037 6.4.2.6 In order to determine if there is statisticalevidence of the component having an effect on theobserved particle count, a test must be conducted to seeif the actual difference between the average backgroundcount, XB, and the average test count, Xt, exceeds twostandard errors in a distribution of differences betweenmeans. The average particle count generated by the testcomponent, Xc, is given by: Xc = Xt  XB 6.4.2.7 The standard error in a distribution ofdifferences between means is expressed as: Sec = Set2+ SeB2 6.4.2.8 The 95% confidence interval of the testcomponent itself is then determined by: X c ± 2 Sec6.4.2.9 If this confidence interval includes 0, then thisimplies that there is not strong statistical evidence ofthe component having an effect on the observed particlecount. If this interval does not include 0, then thisimplies there is strong statistical evidence that thecomponent does have an effect on the observed particlecount.6.4.2.10 Present in tabular form the average particlecount and the associated upper and lower confidencelimits (as calculated in Section 6.4.2) for each test state.In addition, present the background test data separatelyas a distinct element. 7 Related DocumentsAgarwal, J.

SEMI F29-0997 © SEMI 1997, 11031 SEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103)TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEMPANELS This test method was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility ofthe North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on September 3, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org September 2003; to be publishedNovember 2003. Originally published September 1997. 1 Purpose1.1 This document defines the purge efficacy testmethod recommended for determining the minimumacceptable level of purge efficacy for gas sourcesystems used in semiconductor manufacturing. It is alsointended as an aid to the procurement of gas sourceequipment.NOTE 1: Users of this specification are encouraged to submitsuggested revisions or other comments to SEMI. 2 Scope2.1 This specification applies to gas source equipmentused in semiconductor manufacturing facilities andcomparable research and development areas. It includescontamination testing requirements for gas sourcesystems.2.2 The tests covered by this document are as follows:2.2.1 Purge efficacy with a non-interactive gas usingmanufacturers standard purge sequence.2.2.2 Purge efficacy with a non-interactive gas usingthe test method specified purge sequence.2.2.3 Purge efficacy with an interactive gas usingmanufacturers standard purge sequence.2.2.4 Purge efficacy with an interactive gas using thetest method specified purge sequence.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 The document is not intended to determine the safeoperation of a gas source system. The test methoddescribed here is for determining the removal efficacyof hazardous gas from the pigtail portion of the gaspanel during routine cylinder change operations (pre-purge). It does not address the purge condition after thechange of the cylinder (post-purge) nor the purge of theentire gas source system which is usually performed following its initial installation or during maintenance(maintenance purge).3.2 Because the response time of moisture and oxygenanalyzers utilizing different technologies can differsignificantly, this can lead to the possibility thatdifferent instruments will report different peak heightswhen measuring identical contaminant spikes.Therefore, results of tests should only be comparedwhen similar analyzers are used.4 Referenced StandardsNone. 5 Terminology5.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms5.1.1 ppb  Molar parts per billion, same as ppbv.5.1.2 ppm  Molar parts per million, same as ppmv.5.2 Definitions5.2.1 clean dry air (CDA)  filtered air filtered to 0.02mm and dried to a dew point of at least -80°C.5.2.2 dry down  removal of residual moisture in agas delivery or distribution system, often accomplishedby flowing a stream of high purity dry inert gascontinuously through the system for an extended periodof time.5.2.3 dwell time  the time for which vacuum orpressure is applied during the evacuation orpressurization steps of a purge operation.5.2.4 interactive gas  a gas that will readily adsorb tothe surface of a vessel used to contain or transport it.Examples of interactive gases are hydrogen chlorideand moisture.5.2.5 non-interactive gas  a gas that will not adsorbto the surface of a vessel used to contain or transport it.Examples of non-interactive gases are oxygen andnitrogen.5.2.6 pigtail  the pigtail is the part of the gas sourceequipment that is the flexible connection between thecylinder and the gas panel.

Such personnelshould, as a minimum,7.1.1 be trained and experienced in operation of gassource control equipment,7.1.2 be trained and experienced in the use of oxygenand moisture analyzers, and7.1.3 be familiar with the operation and calibration ofthe specific equipment used in performing the tests. 8 Apparatus8.1 Oxygen Analyzer  The oxygen analyzer shouldmeet or exceed the following characteristics:Limit of Detection 10 ppbAccuracy ± 10 ppb8.2 Moisture Analyzer  The moisture analyzershould meet or exceed the following characteristics: Limit of Detection 10 ppbAccuracy ± 10 ppb8.3 Pressure Transducer  The transducer should beof a high-purity type with minimal dead volume andmeet or exceed the following characteristics:Accuracy ± 3.4 kPa (0.5 psi)Hysteresis ± 3.4 kPa (0.5 psi)Non-Repeatability ± 0.7 kPa (0.1 psi)8.4 Mass Flow Controller or Flow Meter  The massflow controller or flow meter should be accurate to ±0.2 slpm.8.5 Moisture Source  The moisture source must becapable of providing a 2 slpm continuous flow of 2.0 ±0.2 ppm moisture in nitrogen mixture at 138 kPa (g) \[20psi (g)\] for a minimum of 30 minutes. 9 Procedure9.1 Purge efficacy determination with non-interactivegas at manufacturers recommended pressure, vacuum,and dwell times.9.1.1 Connect gas source equipment as in Figure 1.NOTE 2: To avoid biasing the test results by substantiallyincreasing piping volume to be purged, the dead spacebetween the cylinder connection and the valves isolating theanalyzer and the contaminant source must be small comparedto the total pigtail volume. The use of mono-block valve andflow-through type pressure transducer is highlyrecommended.9.1.1.1 However, the pigtail is connected to thecylinder valve during the purge in an actual cylinderchange operation. The small additional volume to bepurged in the test setup may be used to account for thevolume of the cylinder valve outlet cavity, which mustbe purged during a cylinder change.9.1.2 To challenge the gas panel with a knowncontaminant gas, completely fill and pressurize the gassource system to 207 kPa (g) \[30 psi (g)\] with CDA asmeasured at the pigtail with the pressure transducer.9.1.3 Using purified nitrogen as the purge gas,complete one purge cycle at the manufacturersrecommended pressure, vacuum, and dwell times.9.1.4 Flow purified nitrogen using a pigtail bleed at 1slpm or at the oxygen analyzer manufacturersrecommended flow rate, whichever is higher, into theoxygen analyzer for 10 minutes or until below thedetection limit of the oxygen analyzer.
