Electrostatic fieldmeters\nare  calibrated  and  recommended  for  use  at  a  particular\ndistance  from  the  charged  object.    Fieldmeters  are  best\nsuited for making general surveys or audits, for making\nmeasurements   of   surfaces   at   very   high   potentials\n(charge  levels),  and  for  making  measurements  when\nlong-term  stability  is  not  important.    They  are  not  well\nsuited  for  measurements  of  surfaces  with  very  low\npotentials or when high spatial resolution of the surface\npotential is needed.\n7. 1.1.1    The   electrostatic   locator/field   s ensor/field\nmeter will henceforth be referred to as \u201cthe fieldmeter.\u201d\nNote that for measurements to be taken in the presence\nof  air  ionization,  a  chopper  stabilized  fieldmeter  is\nrequired.  The  fieldmeter  must  be  capable  of  making\nfield  measurements  at  a  distance  of  2.54  centimeters\n(cm) = 1 inch or less, from the field source to the sensor\nfor  this  guide,  as  written.  However,  see  Section  7.2.5\nfor  fieldmeters  that  are  operated  at  fixed  distance(s),\nand adjust values in this document where applicable.\n7. 1.2    Electrostatic   Voltmeter   \u2014    An    electrostatic\nvoltmeter   nulls   the   electrostatic   field   at   its   sensor\n(probe).    An    electrostatic    voltmeter    indicates    the\npresence   and   approximate   level   of   the   charge(s)\ncreating   the   electrostatic   field.      Under   appropriate\nconditions,   electrostatic   voltmeters   provide   a   better\napproximation   of   the   charge   level   as   compared   to\nelectrostatic  fieldmeters.  Electrostatic  voltmeters  are\nrelatively free of drift and more environmentally stable\nas compared to fieldmeters.\n7. 1.2.1   Electrostatic  voltmeters  are  we ll  suited  for\nfixed installation in equipment.  Electrostatic voltmeters\nexhibit a high degree of accuracy that is independent of\nthe distance from the charge.  Thus, they are considered\nbetter  suited  for  making  more  accurate  and  repeatable\nmeasurements  as  compared  to  fieldmeters.    The  probe\ncan  be  located  very  close  to  a  charged  surface  without\narc-over, and, under appropriate conditions, can resolve\na small spatial area on a surface.\n7. 1.2.2   Electrostatic  voltmeters  are  be st  suited  for\nmaking  measurements  of  surfaces  at  potentials  below\n20kV,  or  when  a  calibrated  or  fixed  distance  from  the\nprobe  to  the  surface  cannot  be  maintained.    They  are\nalso best suited for measuring low surface potentials, or\nwhen it is desired to resolve a small area on the surface.\nElectrostatic  voltmeters  are  unsuitable  for  measuring\nsurfaces at very high potentials, such as above 20kV.\n7. 1.2.3   The  electrostatic  voltmeter  wil l  henceforth  be\nreferred to as \u201cthe voltmeter.\u201d\n7. 1.3   Electrometer  \u2014   An  electromet er  is  a  contact\nvoltmeter  with  a  very  high  input  impedance.  Ideally,\nthis input impedance would be infinite. In practice, it is\nlimited  by  intrinsic  physical  materials  properties  of\ninsulators and by stray leakage paths between the input\nterminals.  Low  voltage  electrometers  (below  200  Volt)\nhave  typical  input  resistances  of  10\n14\nohms,  accuracies\nbetter   than   0.1%,   and   can   resolve   microVolt   type\npotentials.    High    voltage    electrometers    (Kilovolts)\nusually  rely  on  resistive  voltage  dividers  and  have\ntypical  input  resistances  in  the  10\n11\nohms  range  with\naccuracies  in  the  1%  range.  It  is  important  to  evaluate\nand  understand  the  burden  that  the  input  impedance  of\nan   electrometer   represents   when   measuring   voltage\npotentials on very small charged structures.\n7. 1.4   Charged  Plate  Monitor  \u2014   A   c harged   plate\nmonitor  is  an  instrument  typically  used  to  monitor  the\nperformance of air ionization equipment. Monitoring is\ndone  with  an  electrically  isolated  15  cm  \xd7  15  cm  (6\ninches \xd7 6 inches) metal plate, henceforth referred to as\n\u201cthe  plate.\u201d  The  instrument  typically  provides  a  means\nto  charge  the  plate  to  a  known  voltage  (1000  or  5000\nvolts of either polarity), a plate sensor to determine the\nvoltage  on  the  plate,  and  timing  circuitry  to  determine\nthe time required to discharge the plate to a percentage\nof  its  initial  charge.  For  the  purposes  of  this  guide,  the\ncharged  plate  monitor,  or  a  separate  isolated  plate\nassembly,  can  be  used  for  performance  verification\npurposes as explained in Section 7.2.\n7. 2   Equipment  Performance  Verif ication  (Confidence\nTest)\n7. 2.1  Performance Verification of a C oulombmeter \u2014\nRefer to Figure 1.\n7. 2.1.1     Zero    the    coulombmeter    prior    t o    each\nmeasurement.\n7. 2.1.2   Maintain  a  reference  calibratio n  capacitor.    It\nshould   be   a   polystyrene   or   polypropylene   10   nF\ncapacitor (Mallory SX-110 or equivalent).  Measure the\nvalue of the capacitor to better than 1%.  It is important\nto   handle   the   reference   calibration   capacitor   very\ncarefully.    Do  not  hold  the  capacitor  by  its  body  or\ndischarge  it  by  touching  both  leads  with  the  fingers.\nHold  the  capacitor  by  one  lead  only.    Use  a  clip  lead\nconnected between ground and this lead of the capacitor\nto maneuver the other lead of the capacitor between the\n\u201chot\u201d side of the charging source and the input terminal\nof the coulombmeter."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E43-0301 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 20013\n7. 2.1.3  Charge the reference calibratio n capacitor to 1\nvolt  with  a  charging  source  (power  supply).

Use of a suitable power supply or a\ncharged     plate     monitor     for     test     purposes     is\nrecommended.\n7. 2.2.3   Assuring  Meters  and  Operator   Are  Grounded\n\u2014 Assure  that  the  fieldmeter,  voltmeter  and  operator\nare grounded. Turn on the meter and zero it as required\naccording to manufacturer's instructions.\n7. 2.2.4  Directing or Pointing the Sens e Head \u2014  Direct\nor point the sense head of the fieldmeter or voltmeter at\nthe  center  and  parallel  to  the  surface  of  the  plate  at  a\ndistance at least twice the manufacturer\u2019s recommended\nmeasurement.  Slowly  move  the  sense  head  toward  the\ncenter  of  the  charged  plate  until  a  reading  equal  to  the\nvoltage  applied  to  the  plate  in  Section  7.2.2.1  above  is\ndisplayed   by   the   meter.   Measure   and   record   the\ndistance from the sense head to the surface to the plate.\nUsing the plate voltage from Section 7.2.2.1 above and\nthe recorded distance, compute the field strength for the\nfieldmeter.  See  Figure  2,  Fieldmeter  and  Voltmeter\nVerification Check.\n7. 2.2.5     Alternative    to    Section    7.2.2.4    \u2014     Take\nmeasurements    at    a    specified/fixed    distance    per\nmanufacturer's  instructions.  Locate  the  sense  head  of\nthe fieldmeter or voltmeter as in Section 7.2.2.4, but, at\nspecified distance; reading displayed (on meter) should\nbe within 5% of applied voltage to plate.\nNOTE 1: Section  7.2.2.4  or  7.2.2.5  should  be  applicable  to\nmost   meters.   However,   in   every   case,   the   electrostatic\nfieldmeter  or  voltmeter  manufacturer's  instructions  should  be\nread, understood, and followed.\n7. 2.2.6    Other   Desired   Test   Voltages   \u2014    Repeat\nSections  7.2.2.4  and  7.2.2.5  for  any  other  desired  test\nvoltages.\n7. 2.3  Performance  Verification  of  an   Electrometer \u2014\nIt    is    good    practice    to    occasionally    check    the\nperformance  of  the  electrometer  by  connecting  it  to  a\nknown voltage source, and comparing its readings with\nreadings taken by another reference voltmeter.\n7. 2.4    Meter   Stability   \u2014    All   measure ment   devices\nshould  be  turned  on  and  pre-conditioned  for  as  long  a\nwarm-up period as recommended by the manufacturer\n7. 2.4.1   Reset  (zero)  the  coulombmeter   prior  to  each\nmeasurement.\n7. 2.4.2   Check  the  zero  on  the  fieldmet er  or  voltmeter\nas  specified  by  the  manufacturer.  Usually  this  is  done\nwhile   the   probe   is   positioned   to   view   a   grounded\nsurface.  If  the  zero  of  the  meter  has  drifted  by  more\nthan  5%  of  the  test  voltage  for  any  range  contained  in\nTable   1,   the   meter   is   not   suitable   for   use   for\nmeasurements  over  that  range.  It  may  be  suitable  for\nuse over other ranges contained in Table 1, using other\ntest  voltages.    Reverify  the  meter\u2019s  calibration  at  the\nselected test voltage.\n7. 2.4.3   Zeroing  an  Electrometer  \u2014  Ex cept  on  some\nolder analog models, there are usually no provisions to\nzero  an  electrometer.  Some  electrometers  with  analog\nor  digital  read-outs  do  allow  offsetting  of  a  reading,  as\nwell  as  relative  (delta)  measurements.    However,  the\nelectronic zero of the electrometer is usually set by the\nmanufacturer,   and   should   be   part   of   the   normal\ncalibration. It is good practice to occasionally check the\nzero   by   shorting   the   input   terminals   together   and\nverifying    that    the    zero    reading    is    within    the\nmanufacturer\u2019s specifications.\n7. 2.4.4    See   Related   Information   1   for    notes   on\nequipment accuracy and limitations.\n8  Sampling\n8. 1    Sampling   methods   for   this   gui de   should   be\ndetermined  by  the  requirements  of  the  user's  appli-\ncation. Electrostatic surveys can be repeated at different\ntimes to make them more representative of actual static\ncharge conditions in the surveyed area.

However,  any  measure-\nment  that  is  in  excess  of  a  (user)  defined  maximum  or\nthat is a benchmark value, should be repeated more than\nonce,  after  performing  a  zero  check  of  the  measuring\nequipment.   This   is   to   validate   previous   reading(s)\nand/or  establish  a  range/bounds  in  the  case  of  varying-\nmoving fields on previous reading(s).\n9  Test Methods & Measurem ents\n9. 1  Coulombmeter Measurements\n9. 1.1    Verifying   the   Coulombmeter   \u2014    Verify   the\nperformance   of   the   coulombmeter   as   in   Section   7\nabove.  Check/reset  the  zero  before  each  measurement\nand/or  per  manufacturer's  instructions.  Assure  that  the\ncoulombmeter and operator are grounded.\n9. 1.2  Equipment Selection \u2014  Use a c oulombmeter for\ndirect    measurement    of    charge.    A    feedback-type\ncoulombmeter       is       recommended       for       charge\nmeasurements for the most complete transfer of charge.\nShunt-type  coulombmeters  do  not  completely  transfer\ncharge   and   are   not   as   straightforward   to   use   as\nfeedback-type  coulombmeters.    When  using  a  Faraday\nenclosure,  the  Faraday  enclosure  must  be  large  enough\nto   hold   the   objects   to   be   measured.   The   Faraday\nenclosure   is   used   to   measure   charge   on   insulating\nmaterials as well as on conductors.\n9. 1.3  Measurements \u2014  Best results  are achieved when\nall   surfaces   surrounding   the   measurement   area   are\ngrounded (to minimize the effects of stray fields on the\nmeasurement)   and   when   a   consistent,   systematic\nhandling   method   is   used   during   the   measurement\nprocess.    The  operator  should  be  grounded  using  a\ngrounded wrist strap.\n9. 1.3.1  Isolated Conductors \u2014 To me asure the charge\non  an  isolated  conductor,  touch  the  lead  from  the\ncoulombmeter to the isolated conductor.\n9. 1.3.2  Faraday Enclosure Measurem ents  \u2014  Refer  to\nFigure 3. To measure the charge on an object, carefully\npick  up  the  object  with  an  insulated  tool  and  place  the\ncharged   object   into   the   Faraday   enclosure.   Special\nhandling   considerations:   Be   careful   not   to   add   or\nsubtract   any   charge   in   the   process   of   moving   the\ncharged object into the Faraday enclosure.  Don\u2019t let the\ncharged object rub or slide against any other surface, as\nthis may add or subtract charge from the object.\n9. 1.4    Limitations   \u2014    Do   not   attempt    to   measure\ncharges  of  magnitudes  that  are  below  the  drift  rate  of\nthe coulombmeter.\n9. 2  Electrostatic Fieldmeter Meas u rements\n9. 2.1     Verifying    the    Fieldmeter    \u2014     Ve rify    the\nperformance  of  the  fieldmeter  as  in  Section  7  above.\nCheck/reset     the     zero     periodically     and/or     per\nmanufacturer's  instructions.  Assure  that  the  fieldmeter\nand operator are grounded.\n9. 2.2   Measurements  \u2014   Measuremen ts  made  to  this\nguide should be taken/reported in units that conform to\nthe  customer  specifications.  Most  common  fieldmeters\nmanufactured  to  date  have  operating  instructions  that\nreflect    the    user    doing    calibration    and    taking\nmeasurements in English units of volts/inch or volts at a\nfixed  distance  in  inch(es)  and  in  these  cases,  raw  data\nare      reported/listed      directly.      The      international\ncommunity specifies that units shall be in SI (Standard\nInternational) Metric units and the SI conversion factor\nin  Section  7.1.1.1  will  apply.  However,  by  definition,\nelectric  field  is  expressed  in  volts  per  meter,  and  thus\nwould be expressed according to Table 2.\n9. 2.2.1   For  instance,  when  using  a  me ter  calibrated\nonly  at  100  volts,  measurements  under  4,000  volts/m\nwould   be   expressed   to   the   nearest   400   volts/m.\nMeasurements  over  4,000  volts/m  would  be  expressed\nas  >  4,000  volts/m.  For  a  meter  calibrated  to  all  three\nvoltages,  measurements  under  4,000  volts/m  would  be\nexpressed  to  the  nearest  400  volts/m,  measurements\nbetween  4,000  and  40,000  volts/m  would  be  expressed\nto  the  nearest  4,000  volts/m,  and  measurements  over\n40,000   volts/m   would   be   expressed   to   the   nearest\n40,000 volts/m.\nTable 2  Measurement Units\nTest VoltageFor Readings ofExpress in Multiples ofFor Readings ofExpress as\n100 V< 4,000 V/m400 V/m> 4,000 V/m> 4,000 V/m\n1,000 V< 40,000 V/m4,000 V/m> 40,000 V/m> 40,000 V/m\n5,000 V< 200,000 V/m20,000 V/m> 200,000 V/mmultiples of 200,000 V/m\nNote:  Measurements above 1000 volts/2.54 cm may be made based on verification of the meter at 1000 volts where less precision is acceptable\ndue to safety concerns with verification equipment/setup or availability of such equipment."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E43-0301 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 20015\n9. 2.3    Measurement   Limitations   \u2014    Measurements\nmade  to  this  guide  are  only  valid  for  surfaces  that  are\nflat  to  a  radius  of  1.5  times  the  measurement  distance\nfrom   a   point   directly   below   the   sensor   head.

Assure that the voltmeter and operator are\ngrounded.\n9. 3.2  Selecting the Voltmeter \u2014  Sele ct an electrostatic\nvoltmeter with a measurement range consistent with the\nanticipated   levels   of   charge   on   the   objects   to   be\nmeasured.    The  selection  of  too  high  a  measurement\nrange  will  sacrifice  voltage  resolution,  while  selection\nof  too  low  a  range  will  cause  out-of-range  operation\n(saturation).\n9. 3.2.1     To    measure    moving    objects,    se lect    an\nelectrostatic   voltmeter   with   a   response   speed   fast\nenough to detect the objects when they are moving past\nthe    electrostatic    voltmeter    probe    at    the    highest\nanticipated velocity.\n9. 3.2.2   Select  a  side-  or  end-viewing  p robe  for  the\nelectrostatic  voltmeter  as  is  best  suited  to  view  the\ntarget object or surface when the probe is installed in an\napparatus.\n9. 3.3   Measurements  \u2014   Position  the   probe  in  front  of\nthe  surface  to  be  measured.    Best  results  are  obtained\nwhen the probe is placed less than two (probe) aperture\ndiameters  from  the  object  or  surface  to  be  measured.\nAt these closer spacings, the effects of extraneous fields\nare minimized.\n9. 3.3.1   To  resolve  a  small  surface  area ,  the  distance\nbetween  the  probe  and  the  surface-under-measurement\nmust  be  less  than  1/5\nth\nof  the  diameter  of  the  surface\narea to be measured. At wider spacings the surface area\nresolved  by  the  probe  will  exceed  the  surface  area  of\ninterest,  and  measurement  accuracy  may  be  reduced\ntogether  with  the  possibility  of  introducing  effects  of\nextraneous fields to the measurement.\n9. 3.4   Measurement  Limitations  \u2014   Voltage  levels  on\nisolated conductors can be measured.  Insulators do not\nhave  a  uniform  surface  charge  distribution.    Therefore,\nit   is   considered   that   voltage   levels   measured   on\ninsulators  indicate  an  electrostatic  field  strength  in  a\nparticular area.\n9. 4  Electrometer Measurements \u2014  Measuring with an\nElectrometer  is  very  similar  to  measuring  with  any\nother voltmeter or multimeter.\n9. 4.1     Connect    the    \u201ccommon\u201d    termin al    of    the\nelectrometer  through  a  test  lead  to  the  reference  plane\nor ground.

However, it contains relevant information for using the\nstandard in situations commonly encountered with semiconductor manufacturing facilities and equipment. Determination of the\nsuitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user.\nR2-1  Prior handling and environmental conditions will\nsignificantly  impact  the  field  strength  to  be  measured.\nBelow are a number of these considerations:\n\u2022 The presence of nearby grounded surface or object\nwill  tend  to  reduce  the  measured  field  strength.\nThis phenomena is known as field suppression and\nis illustrated in Figure R2-1.\n\u2022 Ionization   of   the   surrounding   air   will   tend   to\nreduce  the  measured  field  strength  by  neutralizing\nthe static charge on the surface of the object.\n\u2022 Rubbing  or  contacting  the  surface  being  measured\nwith another object or surface will tend to increase\nthe  measured  field  strength  depending  upon  the\ntendency   of   the   two   materials   in   question   to\ntribocharge.\n\u2022 Increasing  humidity  will  tend  to  reduce  the  field\nstrength  to  be  measured  because  it  in  turn  will\nreduce  the  magnitude  of  the  charge  generated  on\nobjects  and,  over  time,  assist  in  the  neutralization\nof charge on objects.\n\u2022 Projections  and  sharp  protrusions  on  the  object\nbeing  measured,  or  nearby  objects,  will  increase\nthe field strength.\n\u2022 Insulating  objects  may  have  very  irregular  charge\ndistributions.\n\u2022 As   a   result   of   these   considerations,   a   static\nmeasurement or survey made using this standard is\nonly useful if these factors are taken into account in\na realistic manner.  For example:\n\u2022 If  a  surface  is  only  used  in  a  humidity  or\ntemperature    controlled    environment,    field\nstrength    measurements    made    under    these\nconditions   are   the   main   ones   of   interest.\nMeasurements   made   at   different   humidities\nmay be irrelevant.\n\u2022 An object may present close to zero field in an\nionized  environment,  yet  when  contacted  by\nanother  object  may  become  highly  charged.\nThis charge may persist for a period of seconds\nor minutes while it is neutralized by the ionized\nenvironment.  The  time  required  to  return  the\nobject  to  its  original  state  may  be  a  parameter\nof interest.\n\u2022 An  object  resting  on  a  grounded  metal  surface\nmay  have  very  low  external  field  strength.  If\nthe  object  is  picked  up  and  measured  the  field\nmay be much higher.\n\u2022 Objects  of  irregular  shape  and  size  will  give\nhighly   variable   readings,   depending   on   the\nposition of the sensor relative to the object.\n\u2022 Dielectric   objects   may   give   highly   variable\nreadings,  depending  upon  the  position  of  the\nsensor relative to the charge distribution on the\nobject.\n\u2022 The  simple  act  of  handling  an  object  while\nperforming   a   static   survey   can   change   the\ncharge  on  the  object.  The  best  results  will\nderive   from   making   sure   that   objects   and\nsurfaces  are  treated  and  handled  within  the\nbounds of their actual use.\n\u2022 During     equipment     verification,     maintaining\nconstant/steady  voltage  is  important.  If  the  plate  is\ninitially  charged  and  allowed  to  float,  its  voltage\nwill change as the meter is moved close to it."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E43-0301 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 200113"),(0,i.yg)("ul",null,(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Grounded Surface\nField Lines Terminate on Ground\nand Do Not Accurately\nRepresent Charge on the Surface\nCharged Surface\nField Lines Due to Static Charge"))))))))))))))))))))))))),(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Figure R2-1\nField Suppression")))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E43-0301 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 200114\nRELATED INFORMATION 3\nESD DAMAGE SIMULATORS\nNOTE:  This related information is not an official part of this standard.

However, it contains relevant information for using the\nstandard in situations commonly encountered with semiconductor manufacturing facilities and equipment. Determination of the\nsuitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user.\nR4-1  Introduction\nR4-1.1      Static   charge   generation   is   unavoidable\nwhenever  materials  come  in  contact.    Without  a  static\ncontrol  program,  the  problems  caused  by  static  charge\nare   also   unavoidable.   The   most   common   problem\ncaused by static charge is electrostatic discharge (ESD).\nESD results in damaged semiconductor ICs, photomask\ndefects,  magneto-resistive  (MR)  read  head  defects  in\ndisk  drives,  and  failures  of  the  drive  circuits  for  flat\npanel  displays  (FPD).  ESD  also  creates  a  significant\namount  of  electromagnetic  interference  (EMI).  Often\nmistaken  for  software  errors,  EMI  resulting  from  ESD\ninterrupts  the  operation  of  production  equipment.  This\nis  particularly  true  of  equipment  depending  on  high-\nspeed   microprocessors   for   control.   Results   include\nunscheduled      downtime,      increased      maintenance\nrequirements,      and      frequently,      product      scrap.\nTechnology  trends  to  smaller  device  geometries,  faster\noperating  speeds,  and  increased  circuit  density  make\nESD problems worse.\n6\nR4-1.2      For   many   years   static   control   programs\nconcentrated on protecting components from the charge\ngenerated  on  the  personnel  that  handled  them.  Many\nstatic   control   methods   were   devised   to   control   the\ncharge   on   people   including   wrist   and   heel   straps,\ndissipative     shoes     and     flooring,     and     garments.\nIncreasingly,   however,   the   production   of   electronic\ncomponents   is   done   by   automated   equipment,   and\npersonnel  never  come  into  contact  with  the  static-\nsensitive  devices.  Solving  the  ESD  problem  means\nassuring that ESD events do not occur in the equipment\nused to manufacture and test electronic components.\nR4.2  Static Control in Equipment\nR4-2.1      An   effective   static   control   program   in\nequipment starts with grounding all materials that might\ncome  close  to,  or  in  contact  with  the  static  sensitive\ncomponents.   This   prevents   the   generation   of   static\ncharge on machine components and eliminates them as\na  source  of  the  charge  creating  ESD  events.

If\ncharging    of    components    is    unavoidable,    static\ndissipative  materials  may  be  used  to  slow  the  resulting\ndischarges and prevent component damage.\nR4-2.2    Most  semiconductors  use  insulating  packaging\nmaterials  such  as  ceramics  and  epoxy.  Handling  these\ninsulating  materials  inevitably  generates  static  charge,\nand  this  charge  cannot  be  removed  by  grounding  the\nmaterials. If charge generation is unavoidable, the only\neffective    method    of    neutralizing    the    charge    on\ninsulators or isolated conductors is to use air ionization.\nIonizers  are  typically  mounted  in  the  load  stations  and\nprocess   chambers   of   the   automated   equipment   to\nneutralize the static charge.\nR4-3  Verifying Equipment Static Control\nR4-3.1    A  static  control  program  begins  when  the\nautomated equipment is designed by the OEM, and then\ncontinues  throughout  the  lifetime  of  the  equipment.\nTwo basic issues need to be demonstrated.

It   will   be   difficult   to   establish   any\ncorrelation between the amplitude of the signal received\nby  the  EMI  locator  and  the  energy  in  the  ESD  event\nthat  produced  the  signal.  The  EMI  locator  primarily\nindicates  the  occurrence  of  an  ESD  event  and  can  be\nused  to  illustrate  that  a  particular  static  control  method\nhas  eliminated  it.  It  should  not  be  assumed  that  every\nESD event detected results in damage to components or\nequipment  problems.  Additional  testing  will  be  needed\nto establish that connection.\nR4-5  Static Event Detectors\nR4-5.1    Static  event  detectors  (SED)  are  devices  that\nare installed directly on products to detect the presence\nof an ESD event. They may be attached in proximity to\nan ESD-sensitive component, connected to the external\ndevice  leads,  or  integrated  into  the  device  package.\nTypically they detect the current pulse of an ESD event\nthrough  an  antenna  or  direct  connection  to  the  device\ncircuitry.\nR4-5.2      SEDs   can   be   useful   in   determining   the\noccurrence   of   ESD   events   in   operating   production\nequipment.  The  SED  has  the  ability  to  indicate  ESD\nevents  of  a  known  level,  aiding  in  the  design  and\nperformance   verification   of   automated   equipment.\nWhile costly analysis of failed devices can also provide\nthis  information,  correlation  to  machine  operations  is\nusually   difficult.   An   SED   that   can   be   monitored\noptically   as   it   passes   through   operating   equipment\nprovides  a  convenient  method  to  verify  that  automated\nequipment  is  not  generating  levels  of  static  charge  that\nresult in ESD damage.\nR4-5.3  Types of SED Devices\nR4-5.3.1  In some SED devices, the signal is amplified\nand  processed  to  produce  a  reflectance  change  in  the\nbuilt-in  Liquid  Crystal  Display  (LCD).  The  SED  is\ndesigned  to  trip  at  a  predetermined  threshold  voltage,\ndetecting  ESD  transients  above  the  selected  amplitude.\nSome  devices  can  be  reset  magnetically  or  optically\nmaking them reusable.\nR4-5.3.2      Other   devices   use   the   controllable   ESD\ndamage  threshold  of  metal  oxide  semiconductor  field\neffect  transistors  (MOSFET).  The  test  methodology  is\nto  amplify  an  ESD  transient  to  create  sufficient  energy\nto destroy the gate oxide. The device may be used until\nthe  specified  ESD  level  is  achieved,  and  then  the  SED\nfails.  A  similar  device  is  based  on  the  metal  oxide\nsemiconductor    capacitor    (MOSCAP).    The    current\nleakage through the device significantly increases if the\nESD   amplitude   is   sufficient   to   damage   the   MOS\nstructure. Both of these types of SED must be removed\nfrom  where  they  are  installed  and  require  additional\ninstrumentation to determine their status.\nR4-5.3.3    Another  type  of  SED  employs  the  magnetic\nfields from a current flow to affect a series of magneto-\noptic  thin  films.  The  magnetic  field  from  the  ESD\ncurrent  alters  the  film\u2019s  magnetic  state  and  affects  the\ndegree of polarization of visible light reflected from the\nfilm.  Varying  the  distance  between  the  film  and  the\nESD   current-carrying   conductor   indicates   different\nthresholds.  This  SED  can  be  read  using  a  microscope\nequipped  with  a  polarizing  element  and  does  not  need\nto  be  removed  from  the  circuitry  to  be  read.

For  this  the\nweighing  boat  and  10  mL  benzene  are  given  into  the\nbottle. The bottle is closed and shaken well for approx.\n1  minute.  The  benzene  is  discarded.  This  procedure  is\nrepeated  four  times.  After  the  last  cleaning  the  empty\nopen   bottle   and   the   weighing   boat,   placed   on   a\ndecontaminated aluminum foil (see Section 10.2.1). are\nallowed to dry at room temperature in a fume cupboard\nfor ten minutes. Then the bottle is closed. The weighing\nboat  is  placed  onto  the  micro  balance  by  thermally\ndecontaminated  cross  tweezers.  Approx.  5  mg  of  HPB\nare   weighed   into   the   weighing   boat   by   use   of   a\nthermally  decontaminated  micro  spatula.  The  weight  is\nrecorded exactly for the later calculation. The weighing\nboat is placed into the PFA bottle by the cross tweezers.\n10. 3.2.1.2   The  volume  of  the  benzene  is   measured\nusing  a  100  mL-pipette.  Before  use,  the  pipette  has  to\nbe washed 5 times using 10 mL benzene each time. The\n100 mL benzene are filled into the PFA flask, which is\nclosed immediately.\n10. 3.2.1.3   First  the  bottle,  now  containing   HPB  and\nbenzene, is shaken well for three minutes.  Often this is\nnot  sufficient  for  a  complete  dissolution  of  the  HPB\n(visible inspection). To assure complete dissolution, the\nPFA  flask  is  placed  into  an  ultrasonic  bath  for  5\nminutes  (not  longer,  because  solution  may  get  hot).\nTwo minutes before the end of that time the preparation\nof  the  silicon  chip  is  started.  The  piece  of  silicon  is\nheated   to   red   heat   for   one   minute,   placed   on   the\nthermally  decontaminated  aluminum  foil  and  given  5\nminutes  to  cool.  When  the  treatment  in  the  ultrasonic\nbath  is  finished,  the  PFA  flask  is  shaken  for  three\nminutes again, then given 2 minutes for just standing.\n10. 3.2.1.4  The bottle is opened. By the m icro dropper\n2 \u03bcL are taken from near the surface (tip not more than\n1  mm  under  surface  of  liquid).

Sample  measurements  shall  be  performed\nonly,  if  the  reference  measurement  has  provided  a\nreproducibility equal to or better than 10%.\nNOTE 1: Hexaphenylbenzene has been chosen as a reference\ncompound  because  its  signal  is  well-defined  and  its  mobility\nvalue  is  well  separated  from  the  peaks  of  nearly  all  other\nrelevant  organic  contaminants.  It  provides  positive  ions  only.\nA different reference, Dioctylphthalate, is needed for negative\nions.\n10. 3.2.1.7   DOP-reference  samples:  All  th e  same  as\nHPB,  except  replacing  the  benzene  by  ethanol.  The\nDOP is weighed using a micro dropper (not spatula).\n10. 3.2.1.8   The  mobility  spectrum  of  dioc tylphthalate\nis also well separated but there are several peaks due to\nthermal  decomposition  (phthalic  anhydride  etc.).  This\ncompound is a frequently used plasticizer and therefore\none of the most critical polymer additives.\n10. 3.3   Measurement  of  the  Headspac e  Samples  \u2014\nPositive  and  negative  ions  are  detected  successively  in\ntwo    separate    runs.    At    least    two    independent\nmeasurements  are  carried  out  for  each  polarity.  Every\nmeasurement to be saved consists of 2000 single scans\nand is then repeated. Hence, an automated measurement\nis required.\n10. 3.3.1   The  silicon  chip  is  placed  in  th e  furnace  of\nthe    IMS    using    thermally    decontaminated    cross\ntweezers.  The  measurement  of  the  drift  time  spectrum\n(positive   or   negative   polarity)   has   to   be   started\nimmediately  after  loading  the  desorption  furnace  with\nthe  sample  (time  delay  between  sample    introduction\nand  starting  of  the  measurement:  15 s).\n10. 3.4    Termination   of   the   Measureme nt   \u2014   The\nmeasurement  is  terminated  when  the  signal  intensity\nhas  decreased  to  about  10%  above  the  noise  of  the\nblank   measurement   spectrum.   If   this   point   is   not\nreached  after  two  hours,  the  measurement  should  be\nterminated;  in  this  case,  the  investigated  sample  does\nnot show suitable material properties.\n10. 4   Headspace  Sampling  in  Minie nvironments \u2014\nThe  crucible  tongs  are  preconditioned  as  described  in\nSection  10.2,  and  the  preconditioned  aluminum  foil  is\nplaced   beside   the   minienvironment   that   is   to   be\nexamined.

After   expiry   of   the   storage   time,   the\nweighing bottle is closed with its lid and removed from\nthe minienvironment.\n10. 4.1   The  same  procedure  applies  to   standard  wafer\nboxes or to SMIF and similar boxes.\n10. 5   Headspace  Sampling  of  Polym er  Material  at\nDifferent   Temperatures   \u2014   The   prepared   polymer\nmaterial   inside   the   wrapped   weighing   bottle   (see\nSection 10.2.5) is stored:\n\u2022 either  under  clean  laboratory  conditions  at  room\ntemperature for a defined period of time\n\u2022 or  in  a  suitable  oven  at  a  temperature  of  70\xb0C  or\n120\xb0C  for  exactly  1  hour  followed  by  a  cooling\nperiod of 1 hour.\n10. 5.1  The wrapped weighing bottle i s handled with a\npair of crucible tongs only.\n10. 6  Testing Requirements (check f or device overload\nduring measurement)\n10. 6.1  Positive Ions: Water Cluster S ignal Intensity \u2014\nThe water cluster signal intensity must not decrease by\nmore  than  10%  of  the  blank  spectra  intensity  during\nmeasurement  time;  otherwise,  the  ion  molecule  reactor\nhas  been  overloaded.  If  this  is  the  case,  the  polymer\nsample   is   not   likely   to   be   suitable   for   use   in\nsemiconductor   processing   because   of   unacceptable\nproperties.\n10. 6.2  Negative Ions: Oxygen Cluster  Signal Intensity\n\u2014  The  same  procedure  as  that  in  Section  10.6.1  must\nbe performed for negative ions; in this case, the oxygen\ncluster signal intensity must not decrease by more than\n20%.\n11  Calculation\n11. 1   Description  of  Mobility  Spectr a  Evaluation \u2014\nThe    signal    intensities    of    the    detected    sample\ncontaminants  are  integrated  over  a  specific  interval  for\nboth   polarities.   The   background   signal   intensity   is\nintegrated,  outside  the  specific  measurement  interval,\nwith  preference  to  spectral  region  prior  to  the  peaks  of\nthe   reactant   ions.   The   total   background   intensity\n(integration   of   the   relevant   background   signal)   is\nsubtracted  from  the  integrated  contamination  intensity\n(background   correction).   The   mean   value   of   the\ncontamination   signal   from   the   blank   measurement\n(Section  10.3.1)  spectra  is  subtracted  accordingly.

For this reason, the purchaser needs to specify a time period and the number and type of uses\nto  which  the  FOUPs  will  be  put.  It  is  under  these  conditions  that  the  FOUPs  must  remain  in  compliance  with  the\nrequirements listed in \xa76.\n5. 2  Temperature Ranges  \u2014  The  purchaser  of  300  mm  FOUPs  needs  to  specify  two  sets  of  temperatures  to  which\nthe FOUPs might be exposed. An operating temperature range is the set of environmental temperatures in which the\nFOUPs  will  remain  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  listed  in  \xa76.  A  temporary  temperature  range  is  the  set  of\nenvironmental temperatures to which the FOUPs can be exposed such that when the FOUPs return to the operating\ntemperature range, the FOUPs will be in compliance with the requirements listed in \xa76. Limits on exposure times to\nelevated  temperatures  should  be  specified.  Also,  the  purchaser  needs  to  specify  a  range  of  temperatures  for  the\nwafers that might be inserted in the FOUPs.\n5. 3  Fire Resistance \u2014 The purchaser of 300 mm FOUPs may need to consider the flammability of the FOUPs.\n5. 4  Info  Pad  Configurations  \u2014  The  purchaser  of  300  mm  carriers  needs  to  specify  the  desired  info  pad\nconfiguration (up or down).\n6  Requirements\n6. 1  Kinematic Couplings \u2014 The physical alignment mechanism from the FOUP to the tool load-port (or a nest on a\nvehicle or in a stocker) consists of features (not specified in this standard) on the top entity that mate with three or\nsix pins underneath as defined in SEMI E57. Most of the dimensions of the FOUP are determined with respect to the\nthree orthogonal datum planes defined in that standard: the horizontal datum plane, the facial datum plane, and the\nbilateral  datum  plane.  All  of  the  dimensions  for  the  FOUP  are  bilaterally  symmetric  about  both  the  bilateral  and\nfacial datum planes with the following exceptions:\n\u2022 The features that mate with the kinematic coupling pins and the FOUP sensing pads are symmetrical only about\nthe bilateral datum plane.\n\u2022 The FOUP has a door only on the front and conveyor rails on the left and right sides that are required to extend\nall the way to the front.\n\u2022 The orientation notches on the robotic handling flange are different for each of the four sides.\nThe three features that mate with the kinematic coupling pins must provide a lead-in capability that corrects a FOUP\nmisalignment of up to r69 in any horizontal direction.\n6. 2  (This  section,  \u201cInternal  Kinematic  Couplings\u201d  is  no  longer  applicable,  and  is  intentionally  left  blank  so  as  to\nmaintain paragraph numbering.)"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E47.1-0305 \xa9 SEMI 1997, 2005 4\n6. 3  Interior Dimensions \u2014 The interior of the FOUP must have the interior dimensions of the cassette specified in\nSEMI E1.9. Many of these dimensions are measured from a horizontal datum plane, so an internal horizontal datum\nplane is still specified to be z44 above the horizontal datum plane under the FOUP.\n6. 4  Door\n6. 4.1  (This  section  (6.4.1)  is  no  longer  applicable,  and  is  intentionally  left  blank  so  as  to  maintain  paragraph\nnumbering.)\n6. 4.2  ,  The  FOUP  door  is  on  the  front  side  of  the  FOUP  (corresponding  to  the  front  side  of  the  cassette  where\nwafers are accessed so the door is perpendicular to the wafers and parallel to the facial datum plane), and the door\nand its frame must be designed to mate with a port that conforms to SEMI E62. Specifically, the FOUP door and its\nframe  must  have  surfaces  that  mate  with  the  seal  zones  and  the  reserved  spaces  for  vacuum  application  (which\nincludes all of the circles bounded by r38 except for the holes for the registration pins at the center of each circle)\ndefined  in  \xb6\xb65.3  and  5.6  of  SEMI  E62  (which  specifies  r38).  These  FOUP  door  and  frame  surfaces  must  be  a\ndistance  of  y52  from  the  facial  datum  plane  and  must  have  a  flatness  of  y42.  No  surface  on  the  FOUP  door  may\nproject further from the facial datum plane than the door seal zone and the reserved spaces for vacuum application.\nThe door of the FOUP must also be designed so that when  the  FOUP  is  pressed  against  the  FIMS  port,  both  latch\nkeys on the port are inserted to their full length.  Furthermore, when the latch keys are turned more than 45\xb0 toward\nthe position that unlocks the FOUP door from the FOUP, the latch key holes on the door must be such that the door\nis not removable from the latch keys.\n6. 5  Wafer  Capture  and  Centering  \u2014  When  the  FOUP  is  closed,  the  wafers  must  be  captured  in  the  FOUP  to\nprevent movement during transport. Wafer capture must include gently pushing the wafers to the rear of the cassette\nto center them.\n6. 6  Internal Dimensions \u2014The interior of any FOUP must not intrude on the end effector exclusion zone, and the\ninside of the door must not intrude more that y51 toward the facial datum plane. The interior of the FOUP between\ny11 and the door opening must not protrude higher than z6 above the internal horizontal datum plane and lower than\nz15  above  the  top  nominal  wafer  plane.  Horizontally,  it  must  not  protrude  closer  to  the  bilateral  datum  plane  than\nx51  between  y11  and  y49  or  closer  than  x52  between  y49  and  y52  (as  shown  in  Figure  10).  Dimensions  x51, x52,\ny49, and y52 are specified in Table 1, and y11, z6, and\nz15 are specified in SEMI E1.9.\n6. 7  External Dimensions \u2014 Figures 5 through 8 show the side view, rear view, top view, and bottom view for the\nFOUP. Table 1 defines all of the dimensions. In this and following figures, the heaviest lines are used for surfaces\nthat have tolerances (not surfaces that have only maximum or only minimum dimensions). If a FOUP identification\ntag is used, it must be located at the bottom rear centered on the bilateral datum plane and must be contained within\nthe maximum outer dimensions of the
