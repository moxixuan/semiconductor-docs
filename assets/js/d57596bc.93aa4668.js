(See   Sections   13.1   through\n13. 3.)\n7. 3  In  considering  selection  of  exhaust  systems  and\nabatement  technology,  it  is  essential  to  review  all  the\nmaterials likely to be present in the exhaust.\n7. 4  Contributions from the materials on the wafer must\nalso   be   considered,   as   they   often   cause   blocked\nexhausts   (e.g.,   aluminum   etches   produce   aluminum\nchloride  (a  by-product  of  removal  of  aluminum  from\nthe wafer with chlorinated gases)).\n7. 5  Processes   that   produce   specific   hazardous   by-\nproducts  should  be  evaluated  for  appropriate  point-of-\nuse   abatement   technology   before   discharge   to   an\nexhaust system.\n7. 6  Gaseous and particulate contaminants emitted from\nsemiconductor      manufacturing      can      be      divided\nconveniently  into  nine  major  groups,  each  of  which\nmight justify its own exhaust system.\n7. 6.1  Group-1 Acid \u2014 Easily hydrolyzable acids, (e.g.,\nhydrogen chloride hydrolyzes into hydrochloric acid.)\n7. 6.2  Group-2 Acid aerosols (\u201cdifficult\u2013to-scrub\u201d)  \u2014\nThis  group  includes  acids  that  generate  aerosols  and\nthat  are  not  easily  removed  by  simple  water  scrubbers\n(e.g., aqua regia, sulfuric and nitric).\nNOTE 2: High concentrations of easily soluble acids will also\nfall into the \u201cdifficult-to-scrub\u201d category.\n7. 6.3  Group-3     Ammonia      \u2014      Exhaust      streams\ncontaining ammonia\n7. 6.4  Group-4  Volatile  Organic  Compounds  (VOCs)\n\u2014   Exhausts   containing   volatile   organic   compound\nvapors     or     flammable     gas     discharge     requiring\ndestruction.\n7. 6.5  Group-5   Pyrophoric   \u2014   Exhausts   containing\npyrophoric gases.\n7. 6.6  Group-6   Emergency   Release   Discharges \u2014\nEnclosures  are  provided  with  additional  exhausts  to\ncontain   sudden   unanticipated   releases   of   gas   from\ncylinders, etc.\n7. 6.7  Group-7  Special/Direct  \u2014  Additional  exhausts\nused   to   keep   specific   gases   separate   for   recovery\npurposes  (e.g.,  hydrogen  (H\n2\n)  reclamation  from  EPI  or\nPFC  reclamation  from  CVD  tools,  Oxides  of  Nitrogen\n(NO\nx\n)).\n7. 6.8  Group-8  General  Exhaust  Systems  without  End-\nof-Pipe Treatment \u2014 Exhaust of heat or post-treatment\nexhaust from POU abatement systems.\n7. 6.9  Group-9  Highly  Toxic  Gas  Exhaust  \u2014  Highly\ntoxic    gases    especially    those    with    poor    warning\nproperties  (e.g.,  arsine,  phosphine,  diborane,  germane).\nThe  end  user  has  a  primary  responsibility  to  prevent\ndischarge  of  these  gases  above  a  regulated  level  (e.g.,\nusually  one-half  (1/2)  of  Immediately  Dangerous  to\nLife and Health (IDLH) levels).\nNOTE 3: Facility exhaust systems may be called by a number\nof   different   names   such   as:   Acid,   Corrosive,   Ammonia,\nScrubbed,  VOC,  Solvent,  Incinerated,  Highly  Toxic,  Toxic,\nDedicated,  Special,  PFC,  General,  Heat,  Treated,  or  others.\nThe actual facility exhaust system name, and what groups are\nrouted to each system, will vary by factory and by country.\n7. 7  The groups listed in Section 7.6 are not a definitive\ndivision,   but   represent   a   summation   of   common\nindustry  practice  for  separation.    The  division  is  based\non three basic principles:\n\u2022 avoiding   mixing   of   incompatible   gases   in   the\nexhaust,\n\u2022 potential  need  for  different  end-of-pipe  abatement\ntechnologies, and,\n\u2022 keeping materials separate for recovery.\n7. 8  The  number  of  separate  exhaust  systems  used  is\nentirely   a   decision   for   each   facility,   based   on   the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 processes and chemicals used,\n\u2022 the number of each type of process,\n\u2022 whether recovery of gases is required,\n\u2022 whether point-of-use (POU) abatement is installed,\nand\n\u2022 compatibility  of  emissions  with  each  other  or  the\neffluent handling system.\n7. 9  In  theory,  if  POU  abatement  systems  are  fitted  to\nall sources of gaseous effluent all exhaust could then be\ncombined into a single exhaust system.\n7. 9.1  In  practice  most  facilities  operate  a  compromise\nbetween  the  two  extremes  with  two  to  four  separate\nexhaust  systems  and  point-of-use  abatement  systems\nfitted only to certain sources.

The\npartial  pressure  of  acid  gases  in  equilibrium  with  the\nsolution,    which    increases    with    increasing    solute\nconcentration, reduces the absorption of additional gas.\nReduction    in    absorption    can    be    minimized    by\nincreasing the rate of water blow-down (i.e., using more\nfresh water make-up).\n8. 1.6.8  However,  increasing  the  rate  proportionately\nincreases  the  consumption  of  water  and  the  volume  of\nwater   that   must   be   treated   before   discharge   as\nwastewater.\n8. 1.6.9  The  introduction  of  an  alkaline  solution  (e.g.,\nsodium   hydroxide)   in   the   scrubber   can   assist   in\nremoving  compounds  from  the  gas  stream  if  the  use  of\nwater   alone   does   not   provide   adequate   removal\nefficiencies. The use of additives in the scrubber can, in\nitself, create safety and environmental concerns.\n8. 1.6.10  Some  of  the  neutralized  absorbent  must  be\nbled  off  from  the  recirculated  stream  to  prevent  the\nbrine  concentration  from  reaching  an  excessively  high\nlevel,  but  water  consumption  and  the  volume  of  waste\ncan still be reduced by alkaline solution.\n8. 1.6.11  Aqua  regia  is  a  reactive  mixture  of  nitric  and\nhydrochloric   acids.

If  the  mist  is  relatively\ncoarse,  as  apparently  is  the  case  in  most  instances,  the\nsame types of scrubbers that are used for gas absorption\nshould collect the mists with adequate efficiency.\n8. 2.1.3  If   a   mist   having   a   particle   size   in   the\nmicrometer  or  sub-micrometer  range  is  encountered,  it\nwill  be  necessary  to  use  a  high-energy  scrubber  or  a\nscrubber with a high-pressure-drop, sub-micron filter to\nobtain adequate collection efficiency.\n8. 2.1.4  Whenever  such  a  fine  mist  or  other  aerosol  is\nencountered,  the  gas  stream  from  the  source  should  be\nabated  at  point-of-use  or  separately  from  the  other\nexhaust  gas  streams  in  the  plant  so  as  to  minimize\nenergy costs.\n8. 2.1.5  Abatement  systems  utilizing  a  scrubber  with  a\nhigh-pressure-drop,  sub-micron  filter  are  being  used  in\nthe  semiconductor  industry  to  reduce  emissions  from\naqua-regia  processes,  hot  nitric  baths  and  spray  etchers\nusing nitric acid (entrained in exhaust).\n8. 2.2  It  has  been  determined  experimentally  that  the\ncollection  efficiency  of  a  scrubber  on  a  given  mist  or\ndust  is  a  function  of  the  energy  consumed  in  the\nexposure  of  the  particle  to  the  liquid  in  the  scrubbing\nprocess.\n8. 2.2.1  The  relationship  between  energy  consumption\nand efficiency is little affected by the geometry or size\nof the scrubber or by the method by which the energy is\napplied  to  making  contact  between  the  gas  and  the\nliquid (See Sections 13.1 through 13.3).\n8. 2.2.2  The  energy  consumption  required  to  attain  a\ngiven efficiency increases with a decrease in the size of\nthe aerosol (e.g., mist or dust).  In most of the scrubbers\nused    in    the    semiconductor    industry,    the    energy\nconsumed  is  drawn  from  the  gas  stream  in  the  form  of\npressure drop.\n8. 2.3  The   energy/efficiency   relationship   provides   a\nconvenient   and   practical   method   for   particle   and\naerosol scrubber design.

As  previously  discussed,\nammonia (NH\n3\n) exhausted through the acid system will\nreact  with  the  acids  present  producing  an  ammonium\nsalt aerosol that is not easily abated.\n8. 3.1.1  Packed-bed  scrubbers  are  not  very  efficient  at\nremoving  sub-micron  ammonium  halide  aerosols,  even\nthough they are water-soluble.\n8. 3.2  Wet  scrubber  technologies,  as  listed  above,  are\nsuitable  for  removal  of  ammonia  provided  they  are\noperated and maintained at low pH (e.g., 3\u20135).\n8. 3.2.1  This is normally achieved by the use of sulfuric\nacid dosing.\n8. 3.3  Processes that emit both ammonia and acid gases\n(such  as  nitride  deposition)  should  be  fitted  with  a\npoint-of-use    ammonia    scrubber,    prior    to    being\nexhausted to the acid exhaust.\n8. 4  Group 4 \u2014 Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)\n8. 4.1  VOCs   can   represent   a   large   proportion   of\nexhausted   air   streams   within   typical   semiconductor\noperations.

Point-of-use   systems,   using   the   same\ntechnologies   as   end-of-pipe,   are   employed   where\nexhaust facilities preclude use of an end-of-pipe unit, or\nas     additional     abatement     to     meet     regulatory\nrequirements.\nNOTE 6: See  Appendix  1  for  VOC  abatement  design  and\nselection criteria.\n8. 5  Group 5 \u2014 Pyrophoric Gases\n8. 5.1  Where  separate  exhausts  for  pyrophoric  gases\nhave been installed, it has been practice to fit a large air\ndilution chamber at the end of pipe.  The reasoning has\nbeen that this will ensure safety by dilution and result in\noxidation  of  any  residual  pyrophoric  gases.    However,\noxidation  may  not  occur  since  research  has  shown  that\nsilane,  once  diluted  to  <1.5  %  in  nitrogen,  does  not\nundergo   appreciable   oxidation   when   subsequently\nmixed with air.\n8. 5.2  Due    to    the    risks    associated    with    ducting\npyrophoric   gases   through   a   facility,   it   is   strongly\nrecommended  that  these  gases  be  abated  at  point-of-\nuse.  This avoids the need for a separate pyrophoric gas\nexhaust.    If  POU  abatement  is  provided,  the  discharge\nfrom the POU abatement system can be directed to the\nacid or general exhaust system.\nNOTE 7: See  Appendix  2  for  POU  abatement  of

asphyxiation\nhazards away from people.\n8. 8.4  Discharge  from  general  exhaust  should  be  to  a\nlocation where the heat or reduced oxygen will not be a\nhazard to personnel.\n8. 8.5  General   exhaust   can   sometimes   be   used   for\ndischarge   of   post-treatment   emissions   from   POU\nabatement systems.\n8. 8.5.1  In  such  a  case,  the  discharge  permit  for  the\nPOU

Additionally,  the  typical  scrubber  with\n99+%   theoretical   removal   efficiency   was   actually\nachieving removal efficiencies ranging from 80%\u201395%.\nA1-2.5  Scrubbers being applied to corrosive pollutants\nare  usually  standardized  units  assembled  by  a  number\nof  vendor  companies.    These  units  are  designed  to\nhandle   specified   ranges   of   gas   flow,   but   in   other\nrespects  are  not  designed  but  simply  built.    If  they  are\npacked-bed   scrubbers,   they   are   usually   fitted   with\nstandard  depths  of  packing.    The  liquid  flow  rates  can\nbe varied within limits; but otherwise, the performance\npotentials  are  fixed  unless  there  are  provisions  for\nchanging  the  depth  of  packing  and  perhaps  the  kind  of\npacking.

Measurements  should  be  made  of\nthe contaminant concentrations in typical plant exhaust\ngas streams, and the resulting data should be used to set\nconservative     performance     requirements     for     the\nscrubber.    Performance  tests  on  the  scrubber  should  be\nconducted   prior   to   exposing   the   scrubber   to   the\nsemiconductor plant exhaust, preferably at the vendor\u2019s\nfacility.    Performance  tests  should  identify  the  critical\noperating variables and optimize the settings to achieve\noptimal removal efficiencies at the lowest cost.\nA1-2.6.1    Onsite  performance  tests  may  be  preferable,\nwhen  qualifying  abatement  systems,  so  that  accurate\nprocess conditions can be produced.  Permit exemptions\nmay   be   obtained   for   the   time-period   of   system\nqualification.\nA1-2.7      Design   and   construction   of   scrubbers   are\nsimplified by two factors: the exhaust gas streams are at\nessentially  ambient  temperature,  and  they  carry  few\ninsoluble  solids.  The  low  temperature  allows  use  of\ncorrosion-resistant plastic construction.  The absence of\nsignificant  solids  avoids  blockages  in  the  scrubbers,\nwhich favors use of efficient gas-liquid contactors such\nas packed beds.\nA1-2.8  Two of the most favored scrubber types are the\ncounter-current  packed  tower  and  the  horizontal  cross-\nflow  scrubber.    In  some  instances,  the  choice  between\nthese  devices  may  be  determined  by  plant  layout.    As\nusually  constructed,  these  two  scrubber  types  have  low\nto moderate gas pressure drops and are primarily suited\nto  absorption  of  gases.    They  will  also  collect  the\ncoarser  mists  and  sprays  but  are  unsuited  to  collection\nof fine mists and fumes having particle sizes under 2 to\n3 micrometers.\nA1-2.9    In  principle,  the  counter-current  tower  offers\nthe  highest  efficiency  with  the  least  consumption  of\nabsorbent   liquid.      However,   if   untreated   water   is\nrecirculated through the tower, as is commonly done in\nsemiconductor     plants,     the     advantages     of     the\ncountercurrent operation are lost.  On the other hand, if\nthe absorbed gas is reacted with an appropriate reagent\nin  the  water,  essentially  the  same  performance  can  be\nobtained  with  either  the  countercurrent  or  co-current\noperation (see Section A1-1.7).  In co-current operation,\nit  is  possible  to  use  higher  gas  velocities  to  obtain\nhigher  mass  transfer  rates  so  that  the  scrubber  can  be\nmade   smaller.      Gas   pressure   drops   will   also   be\nincreased, but this may be desirable if it is necessary to\ncollect a fine aerosol as well as absorb a gas.\nA1-2.10    Horizontal  cross-flow  packed-bed  scrubbers\nmay  have  advantages  where  the  installation  imposes\nrestrictions  on  height  or  other  similar  layout  problems.\nHowever,    in    other    respects,    they    do    not    offer\nfundamental    advantages    over    the    packed    tower\nscrubbers.\nA1-2.11    Under  special  circumstances,  other  types  of\nscrubbers may be appropriate for collection of aerosols.\nHigh-energy scrubbers, of the venturi type, or scrubbers\nwith  high-pressure  drop,  sub-micron  filters  (e.g.,  fiber\nbed)   are   appropriate   where   fine   aerosols   must   be\ncollected.      Wherever   possible,   measures   should   be\ntaken  to  avoid  formation  of  such  aerosols;  but  when\nthey  are  unavoidably  produced,  the  source  should  be\nventilated   through   a   separate   scrubbing   system   of\nappropriate design.\nA1-2.12      Packing   in   scrubbers   provides   a   large\ninterfacial area between the liquid and the gas, and also\ninduces   fluid   turbulence   to   promote   mass   transfer.\nPacking  is  commonly  placed  in  scrubbers  in  a  random\nmanner.  Raschig and Pall rings as well as Berl saddles\nwere  common  early  packing  materials  used.    In  recent\nyears, numerous proprietary packing designs have been\nintroduced,  with  the  objective  of  providing  increased\nmass-transfer   efficiency   with   reduced   gas   pressure\ndrop.  The  validity  of  claims  for  superior  performance\nhas  been  established  by  the  SEMATECH  experiments\nin Section 13.1.\nA1-2.13    Numerous  precautions  are  required  when\ninstalling  and  operating  packed-bed  scrubbers.    It  is\nessential to attain an even distribution of liquid over the\npacking; channeling of liquid or gas flow results in loss\nof  removal  efficiency.    Inadequate  liquid  distribution\ncan result in a reduction of the removal efficiency to as\nlittle  as  one  seventh  of  theoretical  (See  Referenced\nDocument     A1-1.9).          The     predominant     liquid\ndistribution  system  employed  is  spray  nozzle  style.\nThis  style  is  inexpensive,  however,  it  is  difficult  to\nmaintain  and  tends  to  entrain  more  water  than  weir-\nstyle.    Weir-style  liquid  distribution  systems  are  more\nexpensive.      However,   they   require   less   preventive\nmaintenance,  provide  equal  liquid  distribution  over  a\nwide  range  of  flow  rates,  and  are  less  prone  to  liquid\ncarry-over.      Precautions   are   treated   at   length   in\npreviously cited literature.\nA1-2.14  A critical aspect of any scrubber design is the\nseparation  of  entrainment.    Carry-over  of  spray  from  a\nscrubber   can   produce   maintenance   issues   and   mist\nemissions.    Failure  to  provide  adequate  entrainment\nseparation has been one of the most common problems\nin   scrubber   installations.      The   predominant   mist\nseparator   employed   is   a   mesh   style.      Mesh   style\nseparators  are  effective  on  the  smaller  water  droplets\nassociated  with  spray  nozzles;  however,  maintenance"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F5-1101 \xa9 SEMI 1990, 200114\ndue to solids and/or biological growth is required.  The\nchevron  style  is  typically  used  in  conjunction  with  a\nweir,  as  they  are  not  very  effective  on  the  smaller\ndroplet associated with spray nozzles; however they are\nvery immune to plugging from solids and/or biological\ngrowth.    The  entrainment  separators  are  discussed  in\nSections A1-1.3 and A1-1.5.\nA1-2.15    Chlorine,  fluorine  and  possibly  other  soluble\ngases  can  be  entrained  in  scrubber  wastewater,  and\nreleased  in  facilities  drains/vents.  Materials  such  as\nfluorine  are  incompatible  with  many  plastics  and  can\ndamage   drains/   vents   resulting   in   leak,   odors,   and\nfacilities interruptions.\nA1-3  VOC Abatement Equipment Design and\nSelection\nA1-3.1  Design Criteria for Adsorption Systems\nA1-3.1.1    Adequate  contact  time  must  be  achieved\nbetween   adsorption   media   and   VOC-laden   exhaust\nstream.

The desired result is that gases will dissolve in\nor  react  with  the  water.  A  large  contact  area  between\ngas and water is required to maximize the dissolution or\nreaction.  Numerous  designs  exist  to  achieve  this.    The\n\u201cpacked-bed\u201d  scrubber  is  filled  with  open  structure\nobjects  (e.g.,  hollow  balls)  that  are  fully  wetted  by  the\nwater  spray.  The  gas  passes  over  this  large  wet  surface\narea.    If  the  water  spray  is  in  the  opposite  direction  to\nthe  gas  path  the  design  is  \u201ccounter  current\u201d;  if  in  the\nsame  direction,  it  is  \u201cco-current\u201d;  and  if  at  90\xb0  it  is\n\u201ccross  flow\u201d.    Other  designs  to  maximize  gas/water\ncontact use meshes, atomized sprays, or multi chamber\nsystems that reverse the gas direction several times.\nA2-2.1.2  Capacity  \u2014  Total  gas  flow  is  determined  by\nthe size of the unit.\nA2-2.1.3  Efficiency \u2014 Efficiency is determined by the\nsolubility  of  the  gas  in  water  and  retention  time  in  the\nunit  as  well  as  the  given  mass  transfer  from  gas  to\nliquid phase.  Acid gases are best removed; many other\nprocess gases may not be removed.

This increases\nthe range of gases that can be removed, from those that\ndissolve in water to those that will react with the chosen\nchemical solution.

The  process  gas\ncontaining   silane   is   injected   into   a   steel   container\nthrough  which  a  stream  of  air  is  passing.    The  silane\nauto-ignites  and  oxidizes  to  form  silica  powder,  which\ndeposits  in  the  system  or  is  carried  into  the  exhaust\nduct.\nA2-3.1.2    Capacity  \u2014  Governed  by  the  build  up  of\npowders,  small  units  may  need  cleaning  out  every  few\nmonths, larger units will provide a year\u2019s capacity.\nA2-3.1.3 Efficiency \u2014 When burn systems are correctly\nset up, nearly complete oxidation will occur, providing\nthat the input silane concentration is greater than 1.5%.\nA2-3.1.4   Limitations  \u2014  Burn  systems  are  suited  only\nto silane (or other pyrophoric effluent) abatement.  Not\nappropriate  for  mixed  gas  process.    If  silane  is  diluted\nto   less   than   1.5%   in   nitrogen   before   input   no\nmeasurable oxidation will occur and the silane will pass\ndirectly to the exhaust.\nA2-3.2  Flame Oxidation\nA2-3.2.1      Principle   of   Operation   \u2014   Oxidation   of\nhydride  gases  by  combustion.    These  systems  use  a\nchamber containing a fuel gas flame through which the\nprocess   gas   is   passed.      The   resulting   oxides   from\ncombustion  pass  into  the  exhaust  and  may  be  abated\ndownstream.\nA2-3.2.2  Flow Capacity \u2014 To calculate flow capacity,\ncombine  the  total  discharge  flows  that  constitute  input\nto  the  abatement  device.

The  heated  mixture\noxidizes,  more  quickly  than  in  a  simple  burn  system,\nbut without a flame from fuel oxidation to assist.\nA2-3.3.2  Flow Capacity \u2014 To calculate flow capacity,\ncombine  the  total  discharge  flows  that  constitute  input\nto  the  abatement  device.  Include  pump  dilution  and\npurge quantities.\nA2-3.3.3  Efficiency  \u2014  Hydride  gases  will  be  oxidized\nand removed to below the OEL.\nA2-3.3.4    Limitations  \u2014  On  its  own,  hot  chamber\noxidation technology is suited only to hydrides or other\ngases that will readily oxidize at the temperature of the\nhot  chamber.    This  method  is  often  combined  with  a\nwet  scrubber  to  remove  oxidized  by-products  or  other\nwater-soluble gases.\nA2-3.4  Non-Flame Oxidation\nA2-3.4.1  Principle of Operation \u2014 Non-flame systems\nuse   an   incandescent   porous   wall   for   combustion\nwithout  a  flame.    Fuel  and  air  are  mixed  and  passed\nthrough the matrix of the porous wall, which operates at\naround 900\xb0 C. When process exhaust gases are passed\ninto this zone, they are oxidized.\nA2-3.4.2  Flow Capacity \u2014 To calculate flow capacity,\ncombine  the  total  discharge  flows  that  constitute  input\nto  the  abatement  device.  Include  pump  dilution  and\npurge quantities.\nA2-3.4.3    Efficiency  \u2014  Hydride  gases  can  be  oxidized\nby  a  method  similar  to  other  combustion  techniques.\nHigh  efficiency  oxidation  is  needed  to  oxidize  more\nstable fluorinated compounds.\nA2-3.4.4 Limitations  \u2014  Non-flame  oxidation  produces\noxidation  by-products,  and  therefore  must  often  be\ncombined  with  a  wet  scrubber  to  remove  particulate\nmatter or water-soluble gases.\nA2-4  Cold Bed Systems (Adsorbers/\nChemisorbers)\nA2-4.1  Adsorption\nA2-4.1.1    Principle  of  Operation  \u2014  Exhaust  gas  is\npassed through a container (cylinder, canister, or drum)"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F5-1101 \xa9 SEMI 1990, 200118\nfilled  with  adsorbent  granules.    These  are  commonly\nbased   on   activated   charcoal.         Some   gases   are\nphysically  adsorbed  into  the  granules  while  the  non-\nadsorbed gases pass through into the facility exhaust.\nA2-4.1.2    Flow  Capacity  and  Removal  Capacity \u2014\nBoth  capacities  of  these  systems  are  a  function  of  the\ncontainer size (mass of granules) and surface area.\nA2-4.1.3 Efficiency  \u2014  For  a  single  gas,  efficiency  can\napproach   100%   until   the   bed   capacity   is   reached.\nHowever, since the gas is only held physically it can be\ndisplaced  by  another  compound,  causing  the  efficiency\nto drop significantly.\nA2-4.1.4    Limitations  \u2014  Adsorption  traps  hazardous\ncompounds  and  does  not  destroy  them.    Gases  are\nadsorbed  at  different  rates  and  the  capacity  of  the  bed\nfor  different  gases  will  also  vary.  A  more  strongly\nadsorbed  gas  entering  the  bed  after  a  less  strongly\nadsorbed   compound   can   displace   the   first   gas   re-\nreleasing the first gas to the exhaust. The waste material\nmust  be  kept  sealed  in  the  container  and  evaluated  for\nhazards.  Exposure to air, water, or heat can cause gases\nadsorbed in the material to be released.\nA2-4.2  Chemisorption\nA2-4.2.1    Principle  of  Operation  \u2014  Exhaust  gas  is\npassed  through  a  container  of  granules  that  consist  of\neither:\n\u2022 adsorbent   granule   coated   with   some   reactive\nchemical;\n\u2022 reactive porous medium e.g., soda lime; or\n\u2022 a resin matrix coated with some reactive chemical.\nA2-4.2.1.1    Gases  are  adsorbed  into  the  porous  matrix\nand   then   chemically   react   either   with   the   granules\nthemselves  or  with  the  coating.    These  reactions  are\ndesigned   to   convert   the   gas   into   a   solid   material\n(typically a salt) that remains attached to the granules.\nA2-4.2.1.2    Reactive  chemicals  are  typically  either\nbases     (metal     hydroxides)     or     oxidizers     (e.g.,\npermanganates, or metal oxides).\nA2-4.2.2    Flow  Capacity  and  Removal  Capacity \u2014\nBoth  capacities  of  these  systems  are  a  function  of  the\ncontainer size (mass of granules) and surface area.\nA2-4.2.3   Efficiency \u2014 Acid/Base and Redox reactions\nare  most  readily  accomplished.    Therefore,  with  acidic\ngases  and  hydride  gases,  efficiency  can  be  high;  with\nremoval  below  OEL.  With  other  gases,  e.g.,  PFCs  and\nhalogenated   carbon   compounds,   efficiency   is   often\nminimal or none.\nA2-4.2.4    Limitations  \u2014  There  may  be  adsorption  as\nwell  as  chemisorption,  so  the  spent  material  must  be\nevaluated  for  hazards,  since  gases  can  desorb  from  it.\nThis  is  especially  true  for  chlorine  (Cl\n2\n)  when  the  bed\nuses hydroxides.  These will form OCl compounds that\non exposure to air or moisture will regenerate chlorine.\nA2-4.2.4.1   Materials   used   for   chemisorption   can\nthemselves  be  hazardous  (e.g.,  heavy  metals  or  caustic\n(KOH/NaOH))   therefore,   unused   canisters   may   be\nclassified as hazardous items.\nA2-4.3  Adsorption with Subsequent Air Oxidation\nA2-4.3.1  Principle of Operation \u2014 These systems are\ndesigned  and  offered  mainly  for  high  flows  of  arsine\n(AsH\n3\n)  and  phosphine  (PH\n3\n),  used  in  the  deposition  of\nIII-V   materials   (such   as   gallium   arsenide   (GaAs),\nindium  phosphide  (InP)).    These  gases  are  adsorbed\ninto a carbon bed, into which air is subsequently fed at\na  controlled  rate  to  oxidize  the  adsorbed  hydride  into\noxides that will remain in the granules.\nA2-4.3.2    Flow  Capacity  and  Removal  Capacity\u2014\nBoth  capacities  of  these  systems  are  a  function  of  the\ncontainer  (drum)  size  (mass  of  granules)  and  surface\narea.\nA2-4.3.3    Efficiency  \u2014  Capable  of  removing  hydrides\nto below OEL.\nA2-4.3.4    Limitations  \u2014  Hydride  is  adsorbed  into  the\ncarbon  bed,  the  oxidation  of  this  is  exothermic.  When\nair is fed in to oxidize the hydride, it is possible to start\ncombustion  of  the  carbon  bed,  unless  the  flow  rate  is\nwell controlled.\nA2-5  Hot Chemical Bed Systems\nA2-5.1  Hot Bed Reactors\nA2-5.1.1    Principle  of  Operation  \u2014  Exhaust  gases  are\npassed through a steel container (cartridge/drum) that is\nfilled    with    reactive    material.        The    material    is\nmaintained at an elevated temperature, typically 250 to\n550 degrees C.  The gases chemically react with the fill\nmaterial  and  are  converted  into  inorganic  salts  that\nremain fused into the matrix of the fill material.  There\nare  versions  with  a  single  fill  material  that  are  specific\nto abatement of one gas, and versions with two or more\nzones of fill material that can abate a wide range of gas\ncompounds.\nA2-5.1.2    Flow  Capacity  and  Removal  Capacity \u2014\nBoth capacities of hot bed systems are a function of the\ncartridge size (mass of granules) and surface area.\nA2-5.1.3    Efficiency  \u2014  Efficiency  of  these  systems  is\ngenerally  high,  with  gases  removed  to  below  OELs.\nStable PFC gases are not removed by all systems."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F5-1101 \xa9 SEMI 1990, 200119\nA2-5.1.4    Limitations  \u2014  Fill  material  can  also  react\nwith  oxygen  or  moisture  so  hot  bed  systems  are  not\nalways suited to wet processes or where air is used.\nA2-5.2  Hot Catalytic Bed\nA2-5.2.1  Principle of Operation  \u2014  Gas  is  passed  into\na   steel   cartridge,   which   is   held   at   an   elevated\ntemperature,  that  contains  granules  of  a  catalyst.

Catalysts  can  be  sensitive\nto  other  compounds;  so  for  complex  gas  mixtures  in\nprocess exhausts they may not be suitable on their own.\nA2-5.3  Hot Reactor Beds with Gas Inputs\nA2-5.3.1    Principle  of  Operation  \u2014  Exhaust  gases  are\npassed  into  a  hot  bed  as  in  hot  bed  reactors  above,  but\nconcurrently   with   the   process   gas   another   gas   is\nintroduced  (e.g.,  air  or  steam).    The  gases  then  react\ntogether  in  the  bed,  either  with  each  other  or  with  the\nbed  material.    Hazardous  gases  are  converted  either  to\nsolid  salts  that  remain  fused  into  the  bed  matrix,  or\nother  gases  ","[e.g.,  carbon  dioxide  (CO\n2\n)]","  that  pass  on\ninto the exhaust.\nA2-5.3.2    Flow  Capacity  and  Removal  Capacity \u2014\nBoth  capacities  of  these  systems  are  a  function  of  the\ncontainer (cartridge) size (mass of granules) and surface\narea.\nA2-5.3.3    Efficiency  \u2014  Process  gases  ","[e.g.,  phosphine\n(PH\n3\n), carbon monoxide (CO)]"," are normally removed to\nbelow the OEL.\nA2-5.3.4  Limitations \u2014 These systems are suited only\nto  processes  where  the  end  products  will  be  either\nstable solids or inert gases.\nA2-6  Reactor Systems (Plasma, Microwave,\netc.)\nA2-6.1    Principle  of  Operation  \u2014   Gases  are  abated  in\nthe  vacuum  line  (before  or  after  the  vacuum  pump)  by\npassing  them  through  a  reaction  chamber,  containing\nplasma, to enhance reaction of gases such as silane into\na solid material.  For high efficiency PFC conversion, it\nis necessary to inhibit recombination by the addition of\na   material   (e.g.,   moisture,   or   a   hydrogen/oxygen\nmixture).    Two  types  of  reactors  exist  -  large  plasma\nvolume/small  surface  area,  in  which  a  downstream\nparticle  trap  is  utilized;  and  small  plasma  volume/large\nsurface  area,  where  solid  films  are  deposited.    Other\nreactor  systems  (e.g.,  microwave  systems)  are  also\nbeing developed.\nA2-6.2      Flow Capacity   and   Removal   Capacity   \u2014\nReactor  systems  are  designed  for  the  process  system\neffluent and are sized to handle specific process flows.\nA2-6.3  Efficiency \u2014 With inputs of up to 300 sccm of\nsilane,  removal  efficiencies  of  greater  than  99%  have\nbeen  documented.    At  higher  flows  efficiency  can  be\nreduced.    High  removal  efficiencies  of  PFCs  have  also\nbeen demonstrated.\nA2-6.4    Limitations  \u2014  Silane  will  form  solids  in  the\nplasma.      Gaseous   by-products   will   pass   into   the\nexhaust.    Solids  transmission  into  the  vacuum  pump\nwill  be  reduced,  but  additional  abatement  devices  may\nbe  required  downstream  if  by-products  need  to  be\nremoved.  Formation of hydrogen (H\n2\n)  as  a  by-product\nshould   be   considered   to   ensure   that   the   H\n2\noutlet\nconcentration is below the lower flammable limit.\nA2-7  Traps/Filters/Cyclones/Precipitators\nA2-7.1  Principle of Operation \u2014  Designed  to  remove\nthe particulate component in exhausts.  Some processes\nproduce solid powders (e.g., silica) and other processes\ngenerate   condensable   vapors.      These   vapors,   on\ncompression  in  the  pump  and  cooling  in  the  exhaust,\ncondense  into  solid  materials.    Numerous  designs  exist\nto  collect  these  solids  out  of  the  gas  stream.    These\ninclude  filters  (paper/bag  etc.),  cooled  condensation\nchambers, cyclones, and electrostatic precipitators.\nA2-7.2    Removal  Capacity  \u2014  Removal  capacity  is\nnormally  measured  as  the  mass  of  solid  the  unit  can\ncollect  before  it  partially  blocks.  As  they  are  blocked,\nthese   systems   generate   a   backpressure,   which   can\nprevent   effective   removal   of   material   or   create   a\nprocess disturbance.\nA2-7.3    Efficiency\u2014  Efficiency  for  these  various  units\nis    difficult    to    measure.    It    is    usually    assessed\npragmatically  in  terms  of  increased  interval  between\nexhaust clean out.\nA2-7.4  Limitations\u2014 These various units must be used\nwith care and only when not associated with hazardous\ngases.    Often  solid  exhaust  materials  are  mixed  with\nhazardous  gases.    If  these  gases  are  present  in  the\ntrapped  solids  a  dangerous  situation  can  result.
