Furthermore, the remote parts of\nthe equipment in the sub-fab must be capable of being installed so that the rectangle defining the cost footprint in the\nsub-fab is entirely underneath the rectangle defining the cost footprint in the main fab. In some fab designs (such as\nslab on grade), there is no sub-fab (or basement). In such cases, these requirements apply to the remote parts of the\nequipment in whichever equipment support area contains the same remote parts of the equipment as a sub-fab. Also,\nsome fabs have multiple sub-fab levels. In such cases, these requirements apply to the remote parts of the equipment\nin all sub-fab levels.\n5. 1.2  Recommendations \u2014 Since the sub-fab is likely to have more columns than the main fab, it is recommended\nthat  the  remote  parts  of  the  equipment  in  the  sub-fab  come  in  modules  that  can  be  arranged  to  accommodate  a\nvariety of layouts.\n5. 2  Equipment Height\n5. 2.1  Requirements \u2014 The maximum height of any equipment (other than a stocker) must be less than or equal to H\nin the main fab and Hs in the sub-fab. Any connections for utilities and required overhead mainten-ance access must\nalso be included within these limits. These limits also apply during installation, so if a part of the equipment must be\nrotated up into place, the diagonal measurement must be less than these limits.\n5. 2.2  Recommendations \u2014 Thus, equipment suppliers are advised to not plan on ceilings higher than these limits.\n5. 3  Floor Loading\n5. 3.1  Requirements \u2014 The maximum mass of any equipment in the main fab divided by its shadow footprint must\nbe less than or equal to M (except when support pedestals are used). Furthermore, the maximum weight on any 0.6\nm by 0.6 m (2 ft. by 2 ft.) floor tile (in any installation configuration) must be less than or equal to Mt. These limits\nalso apply when the equipment is being moved into the fab and installed, unless spreader plates are used.\n5. 3.2  Recommendations  \u2014  It  is  recommended  that  seismic  loading  also  be  considered  when  designing  equipment\nweight distribution.\n5. 4  Move-In-Size\n5. 4.1  Requirements \u2014 To clarify the size of the doors and hallways needed in the fab, this paragraph specifies the\nsize of the equipment's components after it has been uncrated, while it is being moved into the fab, and before it is\ninstalled. All parts of the equipment destined for the main fab must come in packages that are no taller than Z and\nthat  are  smaller  than  X  by  Y  in  two  orthogonal  horizontal  dimensions.  All  parts  of  the  equipment  destined  for  the\nsub-fab  must  come  in  packages  that  are  no  taller  than  Zs  and  that  are  smaller  than  Xs  by  Ys  in  two  orthogonal"))}d.isMDXComponent=!0},5680(e,n,t){t.d(n,{xA:()=>c,yg:()=>m});var i=t(6540);function a(e,n,t){return n in e?Object.defineProperty(e,n,{value:t,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[n]=t,e}function o(e,n){var t=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);n&&(i=i.filter(function(n){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,n).enumerable})),t.push.apply(t,i)}return t}function r(e){for(var n=1;n<arguments.length;n++){var t=null!=arguments[n]?arguments[n]:{};n%2?o(Object(t),!0).forEach(function(n){a(e,n,t[n])}):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(t)):o(Object(t)).forEach(function(n){Object.defineProperty(e,n,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(t,n))})}return e}function s(e,n){if(null==e)return{};var t,i,a=function(e,n){if(null==e)return{};var t,i,a={},o=Object.keys(e);for(i=0;i<o.length;i++)t=o[i],n.indexOf(t)>=0||(a[t]=e[t]);return a}(e,n);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var o=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(i=0;i<o.length;i++)t=o[i],n.indexOf(t)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,t)&&(a[t]=e[t])}return a}var l=i.createContext({}),p=function(e){var n=i.useContext(l),t=n;return e&&(t="function"==typeof e?e(n):r(r({},n),e)),t},c=function(e){var n=p(e.components);return i.createElement(l.Provider,{value:n},e.children)},u={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var n=e.children;return i.createElement(i.Fragment,{},n)}},d=i.forwardRef(function(e,n){var t=e.components,a=e.mdxType,o=e.originalType,l=e.parentName,c=s(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),d=p(t),m=a,h=d["".concat(l,".").concat(m)]||d[m]||u[m]||o;return t?i.createElement(h,r(r({ref:n},c),{},{components:t})):i.createElement(h,r({ref:n},c))});function m(e,n){var t=arguments,a=n&&n.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||a){var o=t.length,r=new Array(o);r[0]=d;var s={};for(var l in n)hasOwnProperty.call(n,l)&&(s[l]=n[l]);s.originalType=e,s.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:a,r[1]=s;for(var p=2;p<o;p++)r[p]=t[p];return i.createElement.apply(null,r)}return i.createElement.apply(null,t)}d.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
