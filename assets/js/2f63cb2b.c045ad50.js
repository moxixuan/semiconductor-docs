It offers detailedinformation related to Section 8. A2-1 IntroductionA2-1.1 E-MTBF p may be substituted for MTBFp in allcalculations in this section.A2-1.2 If the times between failures (known asinterarrival times) of a repairable system or piece ofequipment are independent random times sampled fromthe same exponential distribution, then the (theoretical)rate of occurrence of failures (ROCOF) is a constant and the MTBFp is just 1/. This situation is known inthe reliability literature as a homogeneous poissonprocess (HPP). An HPP assumption underlies thedefinition of MTBFp given in Section 6, and theconfidence limit factors described in Section 7 andAppendix 1. These concepts are described in detail inAscher and Feingold ","[","1","]"," and Tobias and Trindade ","[","2","]",".A2-1.3 If reliability is either improving or degradingwith time, then the ROCOF is no longer a constant anda MTBF p calculation will be misleading.A2-1.4 This appendix contains a simple test for trendthat may be applied if a time-varying ROCOF issuspected, as well as a description of a well known andpowerful model that may be used when reliabilityimprovement trends are evident in the equipmentfailure time data. A2-2 Testing for TrendsA2-2.1 A non-parametric reverse arrangement test(RAT) devised by Kendall ","[","3","]"," and further developed into a table by Mann ","[","4","]"," will be described. Begin bywriting the interarrival times in the order they occurred.For a period with r failures, these might be X 1, X 2, ,Xr. Starting from left to right, define a reversal as anyinstance in which a lesser value occurs before anysubsequent greater value in the sequence. In otherwords, any time we have Xi ","<"," X j and i ","<"," j, we count itas a reversal. For example, suppose a piece ofequipment has r = 4 failures at 30, 160, 220, and 360hours of productive time. The interarrival times are 30,130, 60, and 140. The total number of reversals is 3 + 1+ 1 = 5.A2-2.2 A larger than expected number of reversalsindicates an improving trend; a smaller number ofreversals than expected indicates a degradation trend.A2-2.3 For r up to 12, use Table A2-1 below (adaptedfrom ","[","2","]",") to determine whether a given number ofreversals, R, is statistically significant at the 100  (1 ) confidence level.A2-2.4 For r greater than 12, approximate criticalvalues for the number of reversals (based on Kendallsnormal approximation) can be calculated from: R(r; 1-) = zcritical(2r + 5)(r  1)r72 + r(r  1)4  12 Table A2-1 Critical Values Rr;1- the Number of Reversals for the Reverse Arrangement Test at a GivenConfidence LevelSample Size Single-Sided Lower Critical Value (Too FewReversals Provide Evidence of Degradation)Single-Sided Upper Critical Value (Too ManyReversals Provide Evidence of Improvement)r 99% 95% 90% 90% 95% 99%4 0 0 6 65 0 1 1 9 9 106 1 2 3 12 13 147 2 4 5 16 17 198 4 6 8 20 22 249 6 9 11 25 27 3010 9 12 14 31 33 3611 12 16 18 37 39 4312 16 20 23 43 46 50"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 2 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E10-0304E \xa9 SEMI 1986, 2004 16 A2-2.5 In this equation zcritical comes from the criticalvalues of the standard normal distribution (for 90%significance, zcritical = 1.282, for 95% significance, zcritical= 1.645, and for 99% significance, zcritical = 2.33). Theformula calculates the critical value for detecting animprovement trend. For degradation trends (a smallnumber of reversals) use (r)(r  1)/2 minus Rr;1- as thecritical value. Note that (r)(r  1)/2 just the totalpossible number of reversals when there are r failures.A2-2.6 For example, with 17 failures, the formula forRr;1-, using 95% significance, gives a critical number ofreversals of R17,95 = 88. The maximum number ofreversals is 17  16/2 = 136. That means that observing88 or more reversals signals a likely improvementtrend, while observing 136  88 = 48 or less reversalssignals a likely degradation trend.A2-2.7 The example given in the next section shows anapplication for the reverse arrangement test using TableA2-1.A2-2.8 The AMSAA Reliability Growth Model:Assume the sequence of interarrival time indicates animprovement trend. This will typically be the caseduring reliability improvement testing, where failuresare analyzed down to root causes and actions are takento improve the equipments reliability. Duane ","[","5","]","observed that a plot of tk/k versus tk, where tk is thesystem age at the time of kth failure, typically appearslinear on log versus log graph paper. The slope  ofthis line measures the rate of reliability growth. Typicalempirical values of  lie between 0.3 and 0.6. Crow ","[","6","]","developed this empirical observation into the powerrelationship model used by the U.S. Army MaterialsSystems Analysis Activity (AMSAA model). Thismodel has proved successful in a wide range ofapplications.A2-2.9 The AMSAA model assumes that duringreliability improvement testing the MTBFp is improvingwith time and has an instantaneous value denoted byMTBF I (t). When the test ends at time T, the MTBF pbecomes a constant with the value MTBFI (T). Anestimate of the MTBF p after a test of T hours with rfailures is given by: MTBF I (T ) = Tr (1- ) (1)A2-2.10 In this equation,  is the reliabilityimprovement (Duane) slope,  is estimated by  = 1 - r  1i=1r 1n Tti (2) using the modified maximum likelihood estimates givenby Crow ","[","6","]",". Crow developed confidence limits forMTBF I (T ) that are described in ","[","2","]"," and ","[","6","]",". A2-2.11 Example: During a calendar quarter a tool has550 hours of productive time. Eleven failures wererecorded at the following points of productive time: 18,20, 35, 41, 67, 180, 252, 287, 390, 410, and 511 hours.Determine whether there appears to be an improvementtrend and use the AMSAA model to estimate theachieved MTBFI at the end of the quarter. A2-2.12 Solution: The interarrival times are: 18, 2, 15,6, 26, 113, 72, 35, 103, 20, and 101. The number ofreversals is 7 + 9 + 7 + 7 + 5 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 40.Using Table A2-1, this is significant at greater than the95% confidence level, indicating an improvement trendis likely. Figure A2-1 shows the Duane plot, whichappears to show a linear improvement trend on log-logpaper. The AMSAA model equations give animprovement slope estimate of 0.43 and aninstantaneous MTBFP estimate at 550 hours of 87.2.Note that a standard calculation ignoring theimprovement trend would yield an MTBF P estimate of550/11 = 50, which is a 43% underestimate.A2-2.13 Figure A2-2 summarizes the recommendedprocedure to follow when analyzing system orequipment reliability data, with appropriate referencesto SEMI E10 sections or appendices.

This related information was approved for publication by fullletter ballot on October 15, 2003. R1-1 IntroductionR1-1.1 This related information presents trackingrequirements and standard metrics for evaluating multi-path cluster tool reliability, availability, andmaintainability (RAM) performance. The metrics inthe main body of SEMI E10 apply to non-cluster orsingle-path cluster tools and individual modules in astraightforward manner. While these entities are eitherentirely up (i.e., in one of the SEMI E10 uptimestates) or entirely down (i.e., in one of the SEMI E10downtime states), multi-path cluster tools may still becapable of processing with some modules in anunscheduled downtime state. Furthermore, the effect ofmodule unscheduled downtime on multi-path clustertool performance depends on the specific multi-pathcluster tool configuration and the combination ofmodules in an unscheduled downtime state at eachpoint in time.R1-1.2 Because module performance provides asufficient lowest common denominator for evaluatingmulti-path cluster tool performance, all metrics in thisrelated information are calculated as functions ofmodule-level data only. Specific module trackingrequirements are presented. The metrics, Total FailureRate (TFR) and Cluster-Tool Mean Time to Repair(MTTRCT ), provide simple evaluations of aggregatemodule reliability and maintainability.R1-1.3 Other metrics are based on the specificcombinations of modules and process paths, definedhere as process flows.R1-1.3.1 A process path is a specific set of modulesfor which each module is unique and has no alternativemodules.R1-1.3.2 A process flow is a defined set of modulesthat is used to achieve a process, where any multi-pathcluster tool may have one or more such process flows.A process flow may include alternative modules at oneor more steps of the process. A process flow maytherefore contain one or many process paths.R1-1.4 A method of temporal mapping, defined in thisrelated information, is used to generate a history ofprocess flow and multi-path cluster tool states fromindividual module states. Multi-path cluster toolavailability is then evaluated as the aggregate processflow availability. Multi-path cluster tool reliability is evaluated as the expected, or mean, productive timebetween all process flows being in unscheduleddowntime. R1-2 Module Tracking RequirementsR1-2.1 Multi-path cluster tool metrics require thetracking of SEMI E10 state data from all of the modulesthat impact the RAM or productivity of a multi-pathcluster tool or its process flows. This set of modulesincludes processing and non-processing modules.R1-2.1.1 processing module  an indivisibleproduction entity within an equipment system, e.g., aprocessing chamber or station within a cluster tool.(SEMI E79)R1-2.1.2 non-processing module  an equipmententity that supports the movement or conditioning ofunits through the system, such as, robotic handler,load/unload lock, pre-aligner.R1-2.2 Multi-path cluster tool metrics require trackingat the module level of at least productive states,unscheduled downtime states, scheduled downtimestates, and other neutral states that are not in the firstthree categories. Tracking of these states at the level ofthe multi-path cluster tool as a whole is insufficient foraccurate evaluation of performance. Specificrequirements for tracking these states at the modulelevel, as well as requirements for handling the otherSEMI E10 states, are presented here.R1-2.2.1 Productive state shall be tracked for eachmodule. For process modules, the productive time shallinclude time for active loading and unloading of theprocess module. Waiting times or inactive times,including waiting for load, waiting for unload, andprocess suspend times shall be specifically excludedfrom productive time. Times for heating, cooling,purging, cleaning, etc., that are specified as part ofprocess recipes shall be tracked as productive time.However, similar times that are not specified as part ofprocess recipes shall be specifically excluded fromproductive time.NOTE 1: Productive state events may be derived from SEMIE58 (ARAMS) state change data or the SEMI E116 (EPT)module BUSY state events where the module or whole multi-path cluster tool is known to be in a manufacturing stateand the SEMI E116 task type is either Process orSupport."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 5 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E10-0304E \xa9 SEMI 1986, 200419 R1-2.2.2 Unscheduled downtime state shall be trackedfor each module. Tracking of unscheduled downtimestate for the multi-path cluster tool as a whole is notsufficient. A module cannot be in productive andunscheduled downtime states at the same time. Eachcontiguous instance of unscheduled downtime state fora module is a module failure. Subsequent substateevents within the same instance of unscheduleddowntime state shall not to be counted as additionalfailures.R1-2.2.3 Scheduled downtime state shall be tracked foreach module. Tracking of scheduled downtime statefor the multi-path cluster tool as a whole is notsufficient. A module cannot be in productive andscheduled downtime states at the same time. Instancesof scheduled downtime shall not to be counted asfailures.R1-2.2.4 Time in standby and engineering states shallnot be considered as either productive time, scheduleddowntime, or unscheduled downtime at the modulelevel. For the purpose of tracking multi-path clustertool states and calculating multi-path cluster tool andprocess flow metrics, modules in these states areconsidered as being in a neutral state.R1-2.2.5 Non-scheduled time that is tracked for themulti-path cluster tool as a whole is omitted fromoperations time in calculating multi-path cluster tooland process flow RAM metrics, as it is with the otherSEMI E10 metrics from the main body of thespecification. Non-scheduled time that is allocated tosome modules but not other modules, if any, shall behandled differently, as follows.R1-2.2.5.1 For new modules under installation thathave not yet been used for their intended function, thosemodules shall be considered as non-existent in thecluster-tool configuration.R1-2.2.5.2 For installed modules that have been used,non-scheduled time state shall be treated as a neutralstate.R1-2.3 To calculate these metrics, an observationperiod shall be defined and agreed upon by the userand/or the supplier. Section A1-1.3 provides someguidance on establishing the observation period timeneeded to demonstrate a desired MTBFp at a givenconfidence level.R1-2.3.1 observation period time  elapsed calendartime (e.g., weeks, months, quarters) observing andtracking tool performance. No allowance is made forthe number of modules in a cluster tool. R1-3 Total Failure Rate and Cluster-Tool MeanTime to RepairR1-3.1 Total Failure Rate (TFR)  total count ofmodule-level failure onsets, tracked according to therequirements in Section R1-2, divided by theobservation period time. This metric characterizes thefrequency of repairs where failures on separate modulesare presumed to require independent repair actions.TFR is an indicator of reliability and maintainability.TFR is defined as: TFR =all modules count of module failure onset eventsobservation period time NOTE 2: For different multi-path cluster tools withcomparable module failure rates, a multi-path cluster toolwith fewer modules is expected to have better performanceaccording to this metric than one with more modules.However, the multi-path cluster tool with more modules mayhave a better aggregate intended process flow uptime(Uptime CT-IPF), as defined in Section R1-7.3.R1-3.2 Cluster-Tool Mean Time to Repair (MTTRCT ) mean time to correct a module-level failure andreturn the module to a condition where it can performits intended function; the sum of all repair time on allmodules (elapsed module time, not necessarily totalwork-hours) incurred during a specified observationperiod time (including equipment and process test time,but not including maintenance delay downtime),divided by the total number of failure onset eventsduring that period. MTTR CT =all modules repair time all modules count of module failure onset events NOTE 3: This is the same equation as MTTR for non-clusterand single-path cluster tools. However, because a multi-pathcluster-tool may have repairs occurring simultaneously, thesum of repair time is not constrained to the duration of theobservation period.R1-3.3 For any module, a failure onset event is the firstchronological event of a contiguous instance ofunscheduled downtime. To ensure that over multipleobservation periods, neither failure onset events norrepair time is ever double-counted, the following rulesshall be followed.R1-3.3.1 Failure onset events that occur during theobservation period are counted in TFR and MTTRCTregardless of when those failures are resolved.R1-3.3.2 Failure onset events that occur before theobservation period are not counted in TFR andMTTRCT , even if those failures are not resolved untilduring or after the observation period."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 6 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E10-0304E \xa9 SEMI 1986, 2004 20 R1-3.3.3 For a failure whose onset occurs outside ofthe observation period, the portion of its repair time thatoccurs within the observation period is still counted inMTTRCT.NOTE 4: These metrics also may be calculated for any multi-module tool even if that tool is not a multi-path cluster tool.For a system failure that arises from multiple module failures,the additional severity of this case and the independence ofmodule repair efforts are reflected in this metric. For standardevaluation of a non-multi-path cluster tool, however, the toolis considered to be either entirely in the unscheduleddowntime state or not in the unscheduled downtime state.R1-3.4 These metrics are not compatible withapproaches based on renewal cycle models whereuptime and downtime are assumed to be mutuallyexclusive. As such, subsequent module failures mayoccur even while failures are already in progress onother modules. Other renewal cycle results (e.g., thelimiting probability of finding the system up (ordown) when approaching the system at random)similarly may not apply. R1-4 Temporal MappingR1-4.1 Temporal mapping provides an output statehistory as a function of constituent input state histories.For each event when at least one of the moduleschanges state, the states of the process flows and/orcluster tool may change. For the metrics in this relatedinformation, cluster-tool and process-flow statehistories are generated as functions of module statehistories on an event-by-event basis in temporal, orchronological, order. The metrics themselves arecalculated as functions of these output state histories.For reference, this technique may be regarded asgenerating a type of convolution of constituent statemodels. R1-4.2 Figure R1-1 presents an example of temporalmapping. The constituent input states for two modules,M1 and M2, are shown over the observation period t =0 to t = 10. An output state is mapped temporally as afunction of the module states, where if either module isdown or both modules are down, the output state isdown. Note that transition events for the output statehistory are the union set of the transition events for theconstituent input state histories.R1-4.3 In a near-real-time tracking system, temporalmapping may be performed as each event is generatedand received by the tracking system. Temporalmapping also may be performed afterwards as a batchprocess. Regardless, the logical process is the same.Depending on the mapping to be performed, a differentlogic function is applied at each input state transitionevent to derive an output state value as a function of theconstituent input state values. Two specific temporalmapping functions are used in metrics in this relatedinformation:R1-4.3.1 Process flow up/scheduled downtime/unscheduled downtime states from moduleup/scheduled downtime/unscheduled downtime statesas a function of supplier-defined and/or user-definedprocess flows.R1-4.3.2 Multi-path cluster tool productive/neutral/unscheduled downtime as a standard function,presented herein, of module productive/not-productive states and process-flow up/scheduleddowntime/unscheduled downtime states.NOTE 5: While it may be theoretically possible to model thedesired output states using Harel notation and modelingconcepts, output state complexity may be confounded by thecombinatorial nature of multi-path cluster tools and theirprocess flows. For this application, the temporal mappingapproach is much more straightforward. 5 100 M1 M2 time ConstituentInputStates OutputState = Down= UpFigure R1-1An Example Of Temporal Mapping"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 7 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E10-0304E \xa9 SEMI 1986, 200421 R1-5 Modeling Process FlowsR1-5.1 In order to evaluate multi-path cluster toolavailability and reliability, the set of process flows shallbe defined for the multi-path cluster tool. It isimportant to differentiate between all the process flowsthat are theoretically possible on a given multi-pathcluster tool configuration and those intended processflows (IPF) that are actually intended for operationaluse (i.e., performing its intended function). Formeaningful agreement between any two parties on themetrics presented in this related information, first thereshall be documented agreement on the set of IPFs usedfor evaluation, so that any analyst with the module statehistories can calculate the same values for the metrics.First, the general case of up/down states for an IPF ispresented, and then later the distinction betweenunscheduled downtime and total (i.e., scheduled andunscheduled) downtime for an IPF is presented.R1-5.2 An IPF up/down state is modeled as anetwork flow through the modules that make up thatIPF. If there is connectivity through the IPF network,then the IPF is up; otherwise it is down. Themodules in an IPF network have series and parallelrelationships that determine the connectivity throughthe network. Mathematically, each module and eachIPF has a state value equal to 1 when the state is upand 0 when the state is down. For example, Mi =1, if module i is up 0, if module i is down R1-5.3 The general process steps within an IPF have amutually serial relationship (i.e., if connectivity is notpossible through any single step, then connectivity isnot possible through the network). This is illustrated inFigure R1-2. The IPF state value for serial constituentsis calculated as the product of the constituent statevalues (e.g., IPF =  i=1 to 4 Si = S1  S2  S3  S4). S1 S2 S3 S4 Figure R1-2Serial Process Steps Within An IPF R1-5.4 At any general process step, Sx, the set ofalternative modules, Ai (if any are present), have amutually parallel relationship (i.e., if any one of thealternative modules is up, then connectivity throughthat step is still possible). This is illustrated in FigureR1-3. The state value through this step is calculated as: IPF = 1 -  i=1 to 3 (1  Ai)= 1  ","[","(1  A1)  (1  A2)  (1  A3)","]"," If any alternative module is up, the expression in thesquare brackets evaluates to zero, and the IPF statevalue evaluates to 1, or up. If all of the alternativemodules are down, the expression in the squarebrackets evaluates to 1, and the IPF state valueevaluates to 0, or down. A2 A3 A1 Sx Figure R1-3Parallel Alternative Modules At A Process Step NOTE 6: In general network modeling, it is possible to havecomplicated multi-constituent structures in parallel with othermulti-constituent structures. At the time of this writing, theneed for such structures in evaluating multi-path cluster toolRAM is not anticipated. Therefore, this exposition is limitedto serial relationships amongst the process steps and single-constituent parallel relationships for alternatives within anyone step. To model multi-path cluster tool systems thatexceed these limitations, the modeler is encouraged to consultany text on the modeling of coherent systems for reliability.R1-5.5 For almost all systems, there will be a subset ofmodules that will appear in every IPF regardless of anyprocess differentiation, called the key group. The keygroup includes support modules (e.g., transport, loadlocks), common process modules that are used by everyIPF, and the platform itself. A key group may includealternative modules such as multiple load locks ormultiple cooling stations. The key groups relationshipto all IPFs is such that if the key group is down, all IPFsare down. Therefore, the key group has a serialrelationship to each IPF. By modeling a key group andleveraging it in calculations, substantial redundantcalculations are avoided.

Each contiguous instanceof process-flow unscheduled downtime is a process-flow failure. If the function evaluates to 1, the IPF maybe in either a general downtime state or an up state. Mi-UD =0, if module i is in an unscheduled down state 1, otherwise R1-5.7.2 The second time the function is executed,each module variable is set to zero if the module is ineither a scheduled downtime state OR an unscheduleddowntime state and set to one otherwise. If the functionevaluates to 0, the IPF is in a general downtime state. Ifthe function evaluates to 1, the IPF is a neutral state. Mi-GD =0, if module i is in scheduled down stateOR an unscheduled down state 1, otherwise R1-5.7.3 To summarize, if IPF(M UD ) = 0, the process-flow state is unscheduled downtime (UD). Otherwise, ifIPF(MGD ) = 0 the process-flow state is generaldowntime (GD), and if IPF(MGD ) = 1, the IPF state isuptime.NOTE 8: The process-flow state for an IPF that has at leastone module in an unscheduled downtime state may be either (1) unscheduled downtime, (2) general downtime, or (3)neutral. Condition (1) occurs when the unscheduled downtimemodule is serial within the IPF. Condition (2) occurs when theunscheduled downtime module is not serial within the IPF,but a module (or set of modules) that is serial within the IPFis in a scheduled downtime state. Condition (3) occurs whennone of the downtime modules are serial within the IPFregardless of being in a scheduled or unscheduled state. R1-6 Determining Multi-Path Cluster ToolStatesR1-6.1 The temporal mapping rules for determiningmulti-path cluster tool productive/unscheduleddowntime/neutral states from module productive/not-productive states and IPF up/downtime/unscheduledstates is as follows:R1-6.1.1 If any module is in the productive state,then the cluster tool is in the productive state.R1-6.1.2 Otherwise, if all of the IPFs are in theunscheduled downtime state, then the multi-pathcluster tool is in the unscheduled downtime state.R1-6.1.3 Otherwise, the multi-path cluster tool is in theneutral state.R1-6.2 Each contiguous instance of a multi-pathcluster tool unscheduled downtime state is a multi-pathcluster tool failure.NOTE 9: This logic is similar to the relationship betweenmodule states and the equipment states in SEMI E116, wherethe SEMI E116 busy state is analogous to the multi-pathcluster tool productive state, the SEMI E116 blockedstate is analogous to the unscheduled downtime state, andthe SEMI E116 idle state is analogous to the neutral state.However, the actual relationship between these two sets ofstates is neither trivial, nor direct.NOTE 10: Productive time may not be easily allocated toIPFs in the general case. It is expected that some modules willbelong to more than one IPF and that it will be prohibitive toascertain the specific flow for each module from moment tomoment. Hence, metrics that depend on productive time maynot be calculated for IPFs.NOTE 11: For the metrics presented in this document, it isnot necessary to calculate downtime states other thanunscheduled downtime at the multi-path cluster tool level.The effect of states other than productive and unscheduleddowntime on the multi-path cluster tool is evaluated as theaggregate effect of such states on the IPFs."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 12 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E10-0304E \xa9 SEMI 1986, 2004 26 R1-6.3 Example 3  A simplified example with adiscrete timeline is shown in Figure R1-12.

Standard pressure hasalmost universally been accepted as one atmosphere,except for rounding errors in different units.10.2 Further confusion has existed in the definition ofstandard density when extended to vapors. For perfectgases (most light gases are nearly perfect), the standarddensity can be defined as the density of the gas atstandard temperature and pressure. Since one grammole of a perfect gas occupies 22,414 cubic centimetersat standard pressure and standard temperature, itfollows that a flow rate of 22,414 sccm of any perfectgas is one mole per minute.10.3 By defining standard density as in Section 7.1, thecorrelation between sccm and moles/minute is retained,even for vapors. If standard density were defined as theactual density of the vapor at standard temperature andpressure, then the correlation with moles per minutewould differ by the vapor's compressibility factor (Z).This is not an acceptable alternative because thecompressibility of many vapors is not accuratelyknown, and, in fact, does not exist for those materialsthat are liquid at standard temperature and pressure. 11 Implications for Calibration11.1 Since the standard flow units are defined at astandard density, they represent units of mass flowrather than volumetric flow.11.2 Gravimetric calibration readings in grams perminute (g/min) can be converted to standard cubiccentimeters per minute (sccm) by dividing by thestandard density (g/scc) as defined in Section 7.1.11.3 Rate-of-rise (ROR) data will generally havenegligible compressibility error when operated over alow absolute pressure range. If compressibility errorsare significant, they will cause the rate of pressure riseto be reduced and become pressure-dependent as thepressure increases. In this case, the pressure range mustbe reduced, or correction made, for compressibility.11.4 Volumetric flow data must be corrected fromactual density of the real gas at the test conditions to thestandard density. The actual density can beapproximated for near-perfect gases by ratios ofabsolute pressure and temperature to the standarddensity. For vapors, the actual density at the testconditions must be known from other data.

Wafers may betransported in cassettes or in carriers (such as cassettes in pods). Automation provides flexibility with regard to therange of interface coordinates it can accommodate. On the other hand, it is clear that humans will continue to loadcarriers on tools in many fabs. SEMI E15 is an attempt to satisfy all of these needs, including continued humancompatibility. In fact, compatibility of automation and human ergonomics has been considered of primaryimportance in the rewrite of this standard.A1-2 The increased value for C1, of 75 mm, over the previous value in this standard is determined by theergonomic requirement to accommodate a 95th percentile human male hand carrying a pod by its handles.Limitation of the load port height to 900 mm was, again, driven by ergonomic considerations, as the previouslyallowed value of up to 1300 mm was clearly user unfriendly.A1-3 Equipment suppliers must consider the dimension, S, in order to ensure that their tool will be compatiblewith automation systems and pods. This fact applies to tools with more than one load port per tool. In order toenable space for two pods on side-by-side load ports, the dimension, S, must be greater than or equal to 350 mm fortools processing 150 mm or smaller wafers, and 400 mm for 200 mm wafer tools. The dimension, S, is defined asthe distance between wafer carrier centroids. Driving factors for S are that the size of a pod is larger than a cassetteand that ergonomic guidelines suggest a clearance of at least 75 mm between the box and an adjacent object in orderto provide space for the human hands to grasp and pick up the box by its handles.A1-4 A global horizontal placement tolerance of 15 mm of the carrier centroid should be allowed by thealignment means of the load port. (That is, a misalignment by up to \xb1 7.5 mm in both the x and y directions of thecarrier centroid will still allow the alignment means to guide the carrier to its correct final location on the load port).The misplacement dimension is made large to be consistent with the tactile/visual capabilities of humans and theplacement accuracy of AGVs. This requires that the load port provide some alignment aid to bring the carriercentroid to within the final registration tolerance (generally 0.5 mm) required by the automated wafer handling ofthe tool. Standards for this registration tolerance will generally be found in the SMIF documents.A1-5 The standard purposely does not address vacuum load locks. Since minimization of volume is usually adesign requirement for a vacuum load lock, the minimum clearances (C1  C3) of this standard are not compatiblewith optimum load lock design. It is not intended that vacuum load locks would be the load port of a tool in whichvacuum processing is performed. Simple solutions exist today for transportation of a cassette, or of individualwafers, from a SEMI E15-compatible load port to a vacuum load lock. Open load ports are intended to be specifiedfor use with overhead transport systems for automation.A1-6 It is not easy to formulate a standard which allows compatibility with such a wide range of requirements.Nor is it easy to design equipment compatible with a number of different standards affecting the same hardware.SEMI E15 covers a wide range of applications without causing undue compromise in any particular implementation,while remembering that most of our fabs will continue to use human transport in the immediate future. We hope thisshort discussion of key issues aids in your understanding of the intent and details of the standard.NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for anyparticular application.

The leakintegrity of a gas delivery system is important tomaintaining product quality and performance. Thisguideline is intended to prevent confusion andmisunderstanding between manufacturers and users. Inparticular, it distinguishes between mechanical anddiffusion leak rates. 2 Scope2.1 This guideline contains definitions of terms andprocedures for determining the Leak Rates of mass flowcontrollers as used in the semiconductor industry.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Terminology3.1 Definitions3.1.1 leak  a path or paths in a sealed system whichwill pass helium when a partial pressure differentialexists. A partial pressure differential can exist forhelium even though a total gas pressure differential maynot exist. There are two major leak mechanisms, amechanical passage or a material through which gas candiffuse or permeate. In a real system, a leak may haveboth mechanisms operating in parallel.3.1.1.1 A mechanical leak may be a physical crack, pit,scratch or other imperfection in a sealing surface, orcontamination or debris on the seals. A diffusion orpermeation leak is caused by the movement of heliumthrough gaskets, O-rings, polymers, or other materialsthrough which helium can diffuse.3.1.2 measured leak rate  the leak rate of a givensystem measured under specified conditions andemploying a specified test gas (helium). For thepurposes of comparison with rates determined by other methods of testing, measured leak rates must beconverted to equivalent standard leak rates.3.1.3 sensitivity (minimum detectable leak rate)  thesmallest standard leak rate that an instrument, methodor system is capable of measuring under specifiedconditions.3.1.3.1 For the purposes of this document, theMeasured Leak Rate shall be corrected to StandardLeak Rate by multiplying by the ratio of 101.32 kPa tothe absolute value of the pressurizing helium unlessotherwise called for by the MFC specifications. RateLeakStandardPressureActualHekPa32101RateLeakMeasure = . 3.1.4 standard leak rate  the quantity of helium at25\xb0C and 101.3 kPa (760 Torr) flowing through a leakwhen the high pressure side is at 101.32 kPa and thelow pressure side is below 100 Pa (approximately 1Torr). Standard Leak Rate shall be expressed in thefollowing units:Pa-m3/s (He) = Pascal cubic meters per second,heliumor, alternatively,atm-cc/s (He) = atmospheric cubic centimeters persecond, helium3.1.4.1 The mass spectrometer helium leak detectoris generally used for leak rate testing of high andmedium level vacuum apparatus. Units of sccs, Torr-L/s, and m bar-L/s, have been used in the past but arenot encouraged. Reference materials include MILSTD-202E, C-1.NOTE 1: The Pascal (1Pa = 1 N/m2) is defined as thepressure unit of the international unit system SI. Therefore,the SI units above are preferred. Atm-cc/s is acceptable, as itis widely used in the semiconductor industry. 4 Testing4.1 General Requirements4.1.1 Leak Detector  The leak detector shall be ofthe helium mass spectrometer type. It shall havesensitivity at least equal to or smaller than the specifiedleak rating of the mass flow controller to be tested.

Ifthe sensitivity is not five times smaller, the actual leakrate may be reported if the sensitivity of the detector isalso reported.4.1.2 Helium must have access to all primary seals.4.1.3 Connections between the MFC and the leakdetector must be leak-tight.4.1.4 The ambient temperature of the MFC should be25\xb0 \xb1 5\xb0C unless otherwise specified. If another testtemperature is used, it must be recorded during the test.4.2 Test Procedures  There are two basic setupswhich may be used to measure the leak rate from theexternal environment to the internal gas passages of theMFC or from the internal passages to the externalenvironment. Results for either test method may bereported. The method used must be reported as well. Athird test, the through-the-valve setup, is intended tomeasure the quality of the valve seat shutoff.4.2.1 Internally-Pressurized Leak Test  The purposeof this test set-up is to simulate operation of the MFCunder conditions where the internal pressure is aboveambient.

Once determined, it isrecommended that receiving inspection consist ofmeasuring for leak rate value w1 at the end of intervalt2.4.3.2 Following qualification testing, report typicalvalues for t1 through t4 and w1 and w2. w1 is primarilythe mechanical portion of the leak, and w2 is mechanical plus permeation. In the case where w2 issignificantly greater than w1, w2 is primarilypermeation. In the case of a gross mechanical leak, w1could greatly exceed, and thereby mask, w2.NOTE 3: This test must be performed with elastomers thatare devoid of helium. Such elastomers have either not beenpreviously exposed to helium or have been degassedfollowing exposure. Once this test has been performed, theelastomers must be purged of helium by the passage of timeand/or baking.4.3.3 In good leak testing practice, the backgroundlevel should be verified before the application of heliumto ensure that the elastomers are in a helium degassedstate and that the leak detecting system is in properoperation.

Originally published in 1991; previously published June1997.NOTE: This standard has been purposely restricted to 100mm (4 in.), 125 mm (5 in.), and 150 mm (6 in.) versions ofthe SMIF port. This has been done to establish a base forSMIF port standardization. Aspects of the 200 mm (8 in.)version have been negotiated by interested parties andpublished as SEMI E19.4.1 Purpose1.1 A standard interface is required for containersintended to control the transport environment ofcassettes containing wafers or disks. The interface mustaddress the proper container orientation for materialtransfer and maintain continuity between the containerand equipment environment in order to controlparticulate matter. 2 Scope2.1 This specification describes one approach tointerfacing a clean cassette transport box to a cleanenvironmental housing on a piece of semiconductorprocessing equipment or to other clean environments.The system concept involves mating a door on acassette container to a door on an equipment canopyand transferring the cassette into, and out of, theequipment without exposing the cassette and wafers tooutside contamination.2.2 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Impact3.1 The incorporation of this standard requiresequipment designers to include the features of theinterface into the tool design. Spacing between opencassette ports is inadequate for incorporation of thisinterface. Designers are directed to therecommendations made in SEMI E15 in this regard. 4 Limitations4.1 This standard is specific to the size of thedesignated wafer and references the appropriate SEMIcassette and wafer diameter. A single numerical suffixis assigned to this base standard number or each waferdiameter. This specification focuses on applications in which the interface port is positioned horizontally. Thestandard is focused exclusively on the box-to-canopyinterface. Other considerations of box and equipmentdesign are purposely excluded.NOTE 1: Hewlett-Packard has stated that it is seeking patentcoverage for this design and is offering non-exclusive licenseson an equal basis to any company. Companies intending tomanufacture products to this standard should be aware ofHewlett-Packards position.NOTE 2: The users attention is called to the possibility thatcompliance with this standard may require use of an inventioncovered by patent rights.

Alldimensions of the interface between box and port arespecified in reference to the port. Different sets of portdimensions are standardized to accommodate thefollowing three cassette sizes: 100 mm (4 in.) per SEMI E1.2125 mm (5 in.) per SEMI E1.3 and E.4150 mm (6 in.) per SEMI E1.5 7.2 Port Design Requirements  The general designof the port is shown in Figures 2 and 3. Specificdimensions for the different cassette sizes are given in SEMI E19.1, SEMI E19.2, and SEMI E19.3. Designrequirements for the interface components are providedin Sections 7.2.1 through 7.2.5. The general design ofthe port is shown in Figures 2 and 3. Specificdimensions for the different cassette sizes are given inSEMI E19.1, SEMI E19.2, and SEMI E19.3. Designrequirements for the interface components are providedin Sections 7.2.1 through 7.2.5.7.2.1 Port Door  Dimensions A1 through A3specify the port door top view. The gap between portdoor and port plate is not specified, but should be keptto a minimum distance to restrict particle movement.7.2.2 Guide Rails  The inside distance of the guiderails on the four sides of the port is specified (B1 andB2). The guide rail can be continuous or in sections. Ifconnected at the corners, the inside radius shall notexceed B9. The maximum height of the rail is given byB5. The guide rails include cavities. Two cavities areprovided for the 100 mm (4 in.) port size or fourcavities for the the 125 mm (5 in.) and 150 mm (6 in.)port sizes.7.2.3 Latch Pins  The 100 mm (4 in.) port requirestwo latch pins (C5), located on the port center line at adistance specified by C1 in the unactivated position.The 125 mm (5 in.) and 150 mm (6 in.) ports requirefour latch pins, positioned by C1 and C3. Thedisplacement to move the latch pins from theunactivated (box door closed) to the activated (box doorunlatched) position is specified by the linear dimensionC2 . The minimum available force per pin to unlatchand latch the box door is specified by F1 and F2. Thelatch pins can move in a linear or circular motion aslong as the position of the activated pins falls within thetarget area dimensioned by C8.7.2.4 Registration Pins  The three registration pinson the port door are located asymmetrically, and spacedby dimensions D1 through D4. The size of the pins isspecified by D5 through D7.7.2.5 The Box  The bottom surfaces of the box bodyand box door shall conform to the specified portdimensions. The upper part of the box body and topsurface of the box door must fit and hold in place thewafer cassette specified by SEMI E1, for 100 mm (4in.), 125 mm (5 in.), and 150 mm (6 in.) cassettes.Although the box dimensions are not explicitlyspecified by this standard, the following requirementsapply:7.2.5.1 The bottom surface of the box door at itsperimeter shall match the dimensions of the port doortop (A1 through A3). The tolerances shall be chosen sothat the box door does not extend over the port door inany instance, even when the port door is built to itsminimal acceptable dimensions and potential variance"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 35 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E19-0697 \xa9 SEMI 1991, 20023 between registration pins and holes is considered. Thisis to ensure interference free passage of the box doorthrough the port opening.7.2.5.2 The base of the box body shall fit freely butwith close tolerance between the guide rails (B1, B2,and B9), which not only hold the box in place while theport is open, but also provide proper alignment for theclosure of the box at the end of the open/shut cycle.7.2.5.3 The bottom surface of the box requires threeregistration holes to engage with the registration pins onthe port. The registration pins shall be positioned in thedoor bottom so that the registration pins prevent seatingof the box with the port in the event that the box isimproperly rotated by 180 degrees from the correctorientation. The correct orientation is illustrated inFigure 2.7.2.5.4 The perimeter of the bottom surface of the boxbody shall be continuous (except possibly at the latchlocations) and shall be positioned against the portsurface. This positioning assures the activation of anoptional limit switch placed in an unspecified locationalong the port perimeter for the sensing of proper boxplacement.7.2.5.5 Each box door latch requires a hole to engageits corresponding port latch pin. The hole shall beelongated to provide a target area for the activated pin(box door open) as shown by dimension C8. A protrusion from each latch shall engage with itscorresponding cavity in the guide rail to prevent theremoval of the box while the port is open.7.2.5.6 The center of the cassette crossbar shallcoincide with the center of the box door, with thecassette orientated as shown in Figure 2. The topsurface of the box door requires registration bars thathold the cassette in place. The horizontal cassettemovement is limited by the tolerances G2. The verticalposition of the cassette while located on the box door isspecified by the distance G1 between the top of the portsurface and the bottom surface of the cassette.7.2.5.7 The external top of the box shall not exceedthe top of the cassette by more than two inches. This isto prevent possible interference between the box andthe equipment. 8 ReferencesThe following articles describe the standard mechanicalinterface concept:8.1 The Challenge to Control Contamination: ANovel Technique for the IC Process, The Journal ofEnvironmental Sciences (May/June 1984) , page 23.8.2 SMIF, A Technology for Wafer Cassette Transferin VLSI Manufacturing, Solid State Technology (July1984), page 111."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 36 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E19-0697 \xa9 SEMI 1991, 2002 4 Box Cassette Box GuideRail LatchCavityRegistrationPinPortDoor PortPlate LatchPin BoxLatch Figure 1Port Terminology"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 37 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E19-0697 \xa9 SEMI 1991, 20025 Figure 2"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 38 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E19-0697 \xa9 SEMI 1991, 2002 6 Figure 3 NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for anyparticular application.

The interface mustaddress the proper container orientation for materialtransfer and maintain continuity between the containerand equipment environment in order to controlparticulate matter. 2 Scope2.1 This specification describes one approach tointerfacing a clean cassette transport box to a cleanenvironmental housing on a piece of semiconductorprocessing equipment or to other clean environments.The system concept involves mating a door on acassette container to a door on an equipment enclosureand transferring the cassette into, and out of, theequipment without exposing the cassette and substratesto outside contamination.2.2 The incorporation of this standard may requireequipment designers to include the features of theinterface into the tool design. Spacing between opencassette ports must be considered when incorporatingthis interface. Designers are directed to thespecifications and recommendations made in SEMI E15in this regard.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This standard is specific to 200 mm wafers. Thisspecification focuses on applications in which theinterface port is positioned horizontally. The standard isfocused exclusively on the box-to-canopy interface.Other considerations of box and equipment design arepurposely excluded.NOTE 1: Hewlett Packard has patent coverage for thisconcept and is offering non-exclusive licenses on an equalbasis to any company. Companies intending to manufactureproducts to this standard should be aware of HewlettPackard's position. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E15  Specification for Tool Load PortSEMI E19  Standard Mechanical Interface (SMIF)NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 (See Figure 1 for a pictorial depiction of mostterms.)5.2 Definitions5.2.1 box  a protective portable container for acassette and/or substrate(s).5.2.2 cassette  an open structure that holds one ormore substrates (wafers, masks, etc.).5.2.3 guide rail  a component of a port plate thatprovides coarse location for placing the pod on the portassembly.5.2.4 hold-down latch  a mechanism for locking thepod to the port plate.5.2.5 latch pins  pins that engage the pod door latchand accomplish the pod door lock/unlock functions.Latch pins are carried by the port door.5.2.6 pod  a box having a Standard MechanicalInterface per SEMI E19."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 46 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E19.4-0998E \xa9 SEMI 1992, 2003 2 5.2.7 pod door  a removable bottom for the pod thatcontains a means for properly positioning the cassette.5.2.8 pod latch  a mechanical latch that holds thepod door to the pod until activated by the latchmechanism pins.

See Table 1 for 200 mm (8 inch) Port Dimensions.6.1 Cassette Sizes  All specifications are related to200 mm wafers held in an appropriate cassette. It isunderstood that smaller diameter wafers and othersubstrates may be contained in pods which arecompatible with this standard.6.2 Port Design Requirements  The general designof the port is shown in Figures 2 and 3. Designrequirements for the interface components are providedin Sections 6.2.1 through 6.2.5.6.2.1 Port Door  Dimensions A1 through A3 specifythe port door top view. The gap between port door andport plate is not specified, but should be kept to aminimum distance to restrict particle movement.6.2.2 Pod Guide  The inside distance of the cornerguides of the port is specified by B1 and B2. The lengthof the corner is specified by B12. The corner guidesmay be connected by guide rails if desired. 6.2.3 Latch Pins  Two latch pins are located aroundthe port door center. For location of the pins, see C1,C2, and C3.6.2.4 Registration Pins  The three registration pinson the port door are located asymmetrically, and spacedby dimensions D1 through D4. The size of the pins isspecified by D5 through D7.6.2.5 Pod  The bottom surfaces of the pod body andpod door shall conform to the specified portdimensions. The upper part of the pod body and topsurface of the pod door must fit and hold in place thecassette for 200 mm (8 inch) wafers. Although the poddimensions are not explicitly specified by this standard,the following requirements apply:6.2.5.1 The bottom surfaces of the pod door at itsperimeter shall match the dimensions of the port doortop (A1 through A3). The tolerances shall be chosen sothat the pod door does not extend over the port door inany instance, even when the port door is built to itsminimal acceptable dimensions and potential variancebetween registration pins and holes is considered. Thisis to ensure an interference-free passage of the pod doorthrough the port opening.6.2.5.2 The base of the pod body shall fit freely butwith close tolerance between the guide rails (B1, B2,and B9), which not only hold the pod in place while theport is open, but also provide proper alignment forclosure of the pod at the end of the open/shut cycle.6.2.5.3 The bottom surface of the pod requires threeregistration holes to engage with the registration pins onthe port. The registration pins shall be positioned in thedoor bottom so that the registration pins prevent seatingof the pod with the port in the event that the pod isimproperly rotated by 180 degrees from the correctorientation. The correct orientation is illustrated inFigure 2.6.2.5.4 The perimeter of the bottom surface of the podbody shall be continuous and shall be positioned againstthe port surface. This positioning assures the activationof an optional limit switch, placed in an unspecifiedlocation along the port perimeter, for the sensing ofproper pod placement.6.2.5.5 The center of the cassette crossbar shallcoincide with the center of the pod door, with thecassette oriented as shown in Figure 2. The top surfaceof the pod door requires the registration bars that holdthe cassette in place. The horizontal cassette movementis limited by the tolerances G2. The vertical position ofthe cassette while located on the pod door is specifiedby the distance G1 between the top of the port surfaceand the bottom surface of the cassette."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 47 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E19.4-0998E \xa9 SEMI 1992, 20033 6.2.5.6 A pod hold-down latch is required.
