7  Sampling Plan
7. 1  Unless  otherwise  specified,  ASTM  Practice  E  122
shall  be  used.    When  so  specified,  appropriate  sample
sizes shall be selected from each lot in accordance with
ANSI/ASQC Z1.4.  Each quality characteristic shall be
assigned   an   acceptable   quality   level   (AQL)   of   lot
tolerance percent defective (LTPD) value in accordance
with  ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4  definitions  for  critical,  major,
and minor classifications.  If desired and so specified in
the  contact  or  order,  each  of  these  classifications  may
alternatively  be  assigned  cumulative  AQL  or  LTPD
values.  Inspection levels shall be agreed upon between
the users and the suppliers.
8  Test Methods - Dimensions
NOTE 3: Detailed  test  procedures  of  each  item  should  be
determined between the users and the suppliers.
8. 1  Thickness  of  Top  Silicon  Film —  The  following
two methods are available for thickness measurement.
8. 1.1  Reflective  Spectroscopy —  The  light  of  visual
wavelength (400–800 nm) is introduced into top silicon
film  by  varying  its  wavelength  continuously,  and  then
the  reflective  spectra  is  measured.    When  the  light  is
introduced  into  multi-layers  of  SOI  wafers,  reflection
occurs  on  the  surface  of  top  silicon  film  and  the  front
and backside of BOX.  In such a case, the phase varies.
The  final  intensities  of  the  light  that  reflects  from  top
silicon film surface are the sum of the intensity of light
that  reflects  from  each  layer.    The  thickness  of  top
silicon film and BOX makes optical path difference and
then results in phase difference that is dependent on its
wave length.  The reflective light intensities, depending
on its wavelength, are measured.  The reflective spectra
are  defined  as  the  ratio  of  reflective  light  intensity  to
incident  intensity.    This  spectra  curve  varies  by  the
thickness of top silicon film and BOX.  The top silicon
film  thickness  is  derived  from  the  obtained  spectra
curve  by  approximate  calculation  based  on  simulation
or by comparing with the database.
8. 1.1.1  Reference:  J.-P.  Colinge,  “Silicon-On-Insulator
Technology”, Kluwer Academic Publisher, 1991.
NOTE 4: Thickness  of  top  silicon  film  and  BOX  layer  are
limited to measure because of using visual light.
Example: Nanospec/AFT  model : 210LCW, SP-FSC15
Top silicon film thickness: 0.01–15 μm
BOX thickness: 0.004–3 μm
NOTE 5: Optical   constant   is   already   known   in   each   of
multilayers, and it should be constant in the whole layer.
8. 1.2  FT-IR   (Fourier   Transform   Infra-Red   Spectro-
metry) —  The  reflectance  spectrum  of  the  specimen,
which    exhibits    successive    maxima    and    minima
characteristics  of  optical  interference  phenomena,  is
measured as a function of wavelength using an infrared
spectrophotometer.    These  maxima  and  minima  are
observed  when  the  optical  path  lengths  of  the  infrared
beam,  reflected  from  both  the  top  silicon  film  surface
and  the  top  silicon  film–buried  oxide  interface,  differ
by     an     integral     number     of     half     wavelengths.
Consequently,   the   thickness   of   top   silicon   film   is
calculated   using   the   wavelength   of   the   extreme
maximum  and  minimum  in  reflectance  spectrum,  the
refractive index of Silicon and Silicon dioxide, and the
angle  of  incidence  of  the  infrared  beam  upon  the  SOI
wafer.
Reference:  F95  –  Standard  Test  Method  for  Thickness
of  Lightly  Doped  Silicon  Epitaxial  Layers  on  Heavily
Doped  Silicon  Substrates  Using  an  Infrared  Dispersive
Spectrophotometer
8. 1.3  Definition  of  top  silicon  film  thickness  tolerance
— Thickness tolerance is defined below.
8. 1.3.1  After  top  silicon  film  thickness  is  measured  at
predetermined  number  of  points  within  an  SOI  wafer,
the maximum and the minimum values are chosen, and
then the tolerance is defined as;

SEMI M41-1101 © SEMI 2000, 200112
Tolerance = Maximum value – Minimum value
NOTE 6: The   location   and   numbers   of   measuring   points
should be determined between users and suppliers.
8. 1.3.2  In  case  of  multi-points  measurements    (ex.  a
few  hundreds)  within  an  SOI  wafer,  the  tolerance  is
defined as;
Tolerance = 3σ (3 times of the standard deviation)
8. 1.3.3  Measurement   exclusion   area   such   as   wafer
edge should be determined between users and suppliers.
NOTE 7: Recommendable metrology
a) Reflective spectroscopy or FT-IR is recommended
• for top silicon film of less than several μm (about 7 μm),
• and  FT-IR  for  top  silicon  film  of  more  than  several  μm
(about 7 μm)
b)   Tolerance   is   defined   as   the   difference   between   the
maximum  and  the  minimum  value  after  measuring  several
(ex. 9) points.
c)  It  is  not  necessary  to  measure  the  BOX  thickness  of  SOI
wafer  after  bonding.  It  is  OK  to  measure  it  before  wafer
bonding.
d)  In  case  of  the  above  1)  ~  3),  the  number  of  measurement
points and their location should be specified in case of several
points measuring, and the measurement exclusion area should
be specified in case of multi-points measuring.
8. 2  Crystal Defect of Top Silicon Film
8. 2.1  OSF  (Oxidation  induced  Stacking  Fault) — This
technique is applicable to the top silicon film of thicker
than  1.5  μm.    OSF  density  is  measured  by  preferential
chemical     etching     and     microscopic     observation.
Preparation   of   samples   and   measurement   of   OSF
density are as follows:
8. 2.1.1  Sample Preparation — SOI wafers are oxidized
at  1,100°C,  1  h,  in  H
2
/  O  ambient  after  the  SC-1  and
SC-2 cleaning.  Oxide is removed by ca. 25 % HF and
then  the  SOI  wafers  are  preferentially  etched  by  1  μm,
applying    JIS    H    0609:1994(B),    and    then    rinsed
thoroughly  in  distilled  water  and  blown  dry.    JIS  H
0609  defines  the  chromium-free  preferential  solution,
which is composed of HF, HNO
3
, CH
3
COOH and H
2
O.
8. 2.1.2  Measurement  of  OSF  Density — Samples  are
examined   by   an   optical   microscope.      The   sample
surface  is  observed  by  magnification  of  200  X,  and
OSF  is  counted  on  SOI  wafer  within  the  scope  along
the  two  lines,  which  are  parallel  and  perpendicular  to
the  orientation  flat  (so  called  cross  scanning).    OSF
density   is   calculated   from   the   count   number   and
scanning area.
8. 3  Buried Oxide Defect
8. 3.1  Cu  Decoration  Method —  In  case  of  Bonded
SOI,  the  buried  oxide  is  usually  formed  by  thermal
oxidation.    Therefore,  the  defect  of  buried  oxide  is
taken  into  consideration  only  for  the  thin  oxide  cases.
Buried  oxide  defect  such  as  pinholes  can  be  evaluated
by  Cu  decoration  method.    This  method  has  been
applied  to  the  buried  oxide  film  of  less  than  400  nm
thickness.    Sample  preparation  and  Cu  decoration  are
conducted by the following procedure.  The top silicon
film  on  the  buried  oxide  is  removed  by  KOH  solution,
and  then  cleaned  and  rinsed.    The  sample  is  set  on  a
gold-plated  brass  (Cathode)  in  the  methanol  solution.
On  the  other  side,  a  copper  plate  (Anode)  is  placed  5
mm above the sample surface.  Positive constant bias of
1–3 MV/cm (ex. 40–120 V for 400 nm oxide) is applied
to the copper plate for 5 minutes.  Small leakage current
passes    through    the    buried    oxide    defect,    and
consequently    copper    precipitates    on    the    defects.
Typical allowable defect density is < 0.1/cm
2
.
8. 4  Metal Contamination
8. 4.1  The    surface    metal    contamination    can    be
measured by TXRF, AAS and ICP-MS methods.
8. 4.2  TXRF (Total X-Ray Fluorescence) — Total X-ray
Fluorescence  uses  a  low  angle  incident,  and  a  tightly
collimated X-ray beam excites the characteristic X-rays
from impurity atoms near the sample surface.  Usually,
the angle of X-ray incident is less than 0.1 degree.  The
element  identification  and  the  amount  of  the  element
can be obtained by measuring energy and intensities of
fluorescence X-ray.  The instrument provides a map of
impurity   element   distribution.      The   surface   metal
contamination  (typically  from  Na  to  Zn)  shall  be  less
than 10
11
cm
-2
in total.
NOTE 8: This  TXRF  method  is  conveniently  used  to  detect
the metals on the SOI wafer surface.
8. 4.3  AAS  (Atomic  Absorption  Spectrophotometry)  —
The  elemental  characteristic  absorption  of  the  atom  is
measured  by  introducing  sample  solution  as  aerosol
into the flame and then spectral absorption through the
flame   from   the   light   source   is   detected   by   the
spectroscope.    The  flameless  method,  superior  to  the
flame method in the sensitivity, is now broadly used.
8. 4.3.1  Sample     Preparation —     Careful     sample
preparation  is  necessary  for  the  precise  measurement.
SOI  wafer  surface  is  exposed  to  HF  vapor,  and  the
metals  on  the  surface  are  collected  as  droplet.    To
improve   the   sensitivity,   the   volume   of   collective
solution should be as tiny as possible and the HF drops
are rolled all over the surface in collective operation. In
case of precious metals, it is better to use other kinds of
collective solutions instead, since they are not dissolved
or collected by HF solution itself.

For Au and Pt; aqua regia (HNO
3
: HCl = 1 : 3)
8. 4.4  ICP-MS   (Inductively   Coupled   Plasma   Mass
Spectrometry) —    ICP-MS    is    composed    of    ICP
(Inductively Coupled Plasma) part as an ion source and
MS (Mass Spectrometer) part, which measures the ions
generated  at  ICP  part.    Usually,  sample  solution  is
vaporized  in  the  nebulizer  and  then  finally  introduced
into   Argon   plasma   in   the   silica   tube   called   torch
through the spray chamber.  The sample is decomposed,
evaporated,  atomized  and  then  ionized  in  the  Argon
plasma.  Except for few atoms that have relatively high
ionization  potential,  most  of  the  elements  (>  90%)  can
be ionized.  Ions are identified and measured in amount
by the mass spectrometer.
8. 4.4.1  Sample  Preparation —  The  same  method  as
AAS  method  is  applicable.    In  case  of  quantitative
measurement  of  Fe,  since  its  mass  weight  is  close  to
that  of  ArO
+
,  it  is  necessary  to  pay  attention  to  the
degradation of detection sensitivity.
8. 5  Particle Density (LPD : Light Point Defect )
8. 5.1  Light   Scattering   Tomography — The   particle
larger  than  0.2  μm  on  the  thick  SOI  wafers  is  counted
by  Automated  particle  counter.    The  particles  in  the
order  of  0.1  μm  can  be  detected  if  top  silicon  film  is
sufficiently thick.
8. 5.2  Principle  of  measurement — By  scanning  the
laser  beam  on  the  wafer  surface,  the  light  scattered  by
the  particles  on  the  wafer  is  detected.    The  scattered
light and the noise from the wafer surface is detected as
a direct current, on the other hand, the scattered light by
the particles can be detected as pulse components.  The
particle size can be calibrated with standard polystyrene
latex spheres.  Multi-layers of SOI wafers usually have
scattering noise from the layer interface.  In case of less
than  1  μm  of  the  top  silicon  film  thickness,  it  is
necessary to reduce incident angle of the laser beam to
increase the reflective component from the surface.  For
example, S/N ratio is improved when using S-polarized
light  of  10  degree  incident,  85%  of  its  component  is
reflected from silicon surface.
NOTE 9: In case of SOI wafer (Thickness > 1 μm)
Particle  counter  with  a  vertical  incident  laser,    which  is  the
same  one  used  for  the  bulk  wafer,  is  applied.    It  should  be
noted that bypass filter to erase the interference signals due to
thickness   dispersion,   and   adjustment   of   photo-multiplier
sensitivity  are  necessary.  By  this  technique,  it  is  capable  of
detecting particles (> 0.1μm) as much as on the bulk wafer.
NOTE 10: In case of SOI wafer (Thickness < 0.5 μm)
It  is  recommended  to  use  S  -  polarized  light  or  normal  light
with  low  incident  angle  because  of  high  scattering  noise.
However,  the  adjustment  of  photo-multiplier  sensitivity  is
necessary  to  reduce  the  noise  component.  The  sensitivity
depends  on  the  magnitude  of  the  noise  and  it  is  usually
possible  to  detect  particles  of  around  more  than  0.5μm  (in
bulk wafer, > 0.2 μm).
8. 5.3  Visual  Inspection — SOI  wafer  can  be  visually
inspected   in   accordance   with   ASTM   F523.      The
automatic   inspection   equipment   is   also   used   when
available.    For  visual  inspection,  the  collimated  high
intensity  bright  light  (ex.  500,000  lux)  is  used.    Under
using  this  light,  SOI  wafer  is  inspected  for  haze,  slip,
scratches,  chips,  cracks,  pits,  dimples,  mound,  orange
peel, LPD and contamination.
8. 6  Surface Roughness
8. 6.1  AFM    (Atomic    Force    Microscope) —    By
contacting  the  probe  equipped  with  the  cantilever  onto
the  wafer  surface  of  the  sample,  and  by  scanning  the
cantilever  and  detecting  the  variation  by  i.e.,  optical
method, the roughness information is obtained.
NOTE 11: It  is  expected  to  set  the  observation  area  as  >  20
μm × 20 μm to increase reliability of the data.
NOTE 12: Height calibration of concave and convex: Refer to
UC  standard  (“Calibration  method  of  1  μm  order  height  in
AFM”,  [Ultra  Clean  Technology,  Vol.  7,  No.  2,  pp.  43,
1995]).
8. 7  Inclusions
8. 7.1  In    bonded    SOI    wafer,    there    exists    the
contaminants   at   the   bonding   Si/SiO
2
or   SiO
2
/SiO
2
interface    such    as    particles,    metals,    boron,    and
hydrocarbon.  Here, inclusions means the contaminants.
Although  there  has  been  no  report  on  the  influence  of
contaminants    to    the    device    characteristics,    the
improvement of the contamination level is required.
8. 8  Void
8. 8.1  Scanning  Acoustic  Topography —  The  void  can
be detected by means of the traveling time difference of
the acoustic waves.  The void mapping can be made by
scanning an ultrasonic wave and detecting the reflecting
wave from the both surfaces of the void.  Measuring in
water  improves  the  resolving  power  of  location  since
the ultrasonic wave can be tightened by acoustic lenses.
NOTE 13: It  is  not  suitable  to  measure  SOI  wafer  that  is  not
bonded firmly because measurement is conducted in water.
NOTE 14: It  is  not  suitable  to  measure  top  silicon  film  (<  7
μm) because it is impossible to separate reflective waves both
from top silicon film surface and the bonding interface.
NOTE 15: Detectable  void  gap  depends  on  acoustic  wave
frequency.  Detectable  void  diameter  depends  on  the  size  of
the acoustic source and the receiver.  For example, if using 75

SEMI M41-1101 © SEMI 2000, 200114
MHz frequency, 5 nm void gap and 50 μm void diameter can
be detected.
NOTE 16: Void is defined as “empty space” that is due to the
imperfect  bonding  at  Si/SiO
2
and  SiO
2
/  SiO
2
interface.    This
void  should  be  discriminated  from  the  splitting  at  bonding
strength test.
NOTE 17: Void  can  be  only  evaluated  during  SOI  wafer
processing, not at the shipping.
8. 9  Bonding Strength
8. 9.1  Tensile  Testing  Method —  Bonding  strength  is
defined  and  evaluated  by  tensile  strength  (kgf/cm
2
)
which is needed to split the bonding interface vertically.
Details  of  the  test  structure  and  the  test  method  should
be  determined  by  negotiation  between  wafer  users  and
wafer suppliers.

9. 1.1.1  Excess carriers that are created in the wafer by a light pulse increases the conductivity of the sample.  When
the light is turned off, the conductivity is decreased by the carrier recombination.  This phenom-enon is monitored
by  means  of  microwave  reflectance.    The  microwave  detects  an  exponential  decay  in  conduc-tivity,  from  which  a
decay constant is determined.

9. 3.2  Test  method  —  MOS  high-frequency  C-V  measurement  of  a  Box  capacitor  normally  yields  a  flat  band
voltage.    Details  of  the  test  structure  and  the  test  method  are  determined  by  negotiation  between  wafer  users  and
wafer suppliers.

9. 4.3  If  care  is  taken  in  their  fabrication  to  minimize  oxide  surface  damage  and  contamination  during  silicon
etching, good quality quasi-static MOS C-V curves can be measured.  From comparison of high and low frequency
C-V curves, midgap interface state density can be determined.  Details of the test structure and the test method are
determined by negotiation between wafer users and wafer suppliers.
9. 5  Doping Density
9. 5.1  Test Method — SIMS
9. 5.1.1  Be careful of electrical charging up of test pieces due to the existence of BOX, the difference of detecting

SPECIFICATION FOR COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTOR EPITAXIAL
WAFERS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Compound  Semiconductor  Committee  and  is  the
direct responsibility of the North American Compound Semiconductor Committee. Current edition approved
by  the  North  American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  28,  2000.    Initially  available  at
www.semi.org September 2000; to be published October 2000.
1  Purpose
1. 1   Compound  semiconductor  epi taxial  layers  have
been  extensively  used  for  many  years  as  the  basis  of
high   speed   electronics   and   optoelectronic   devices.
There  are  suppliers  of  epitaxial  layers  who  will  grow
material  to  the  customer’s  specification.    There  is  a
need to define standardized descriptive terms, tolerance
schedules  and  recommended  test  methods  to  reduce
ambiguity  in  the  interpretation  of  specifications  for
such   wafers.   Special   emphasis   is   placed   on   the
definitions  pertaining  to  uniformity.    This  proposed
document   addresses   only   the   basic   requirements.
Further  clarification  may  be  required  between  supplier
and purchaser for the particular layers required.

grown on monocrystalline wafers of GaAs or InP (other
substrates    may    be    considered    where    appropriate
documents  exist  to  describe  the  specification  of  the
substrate).  This document may only cover a portion of
the  properties  considered  to  be  part  of  the  purchase
specification.
2. 2   This  specification  does  not  pur port  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility   of   the   users   of   this   specification   to
establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and

4  Terminology
4. 1  epitaxy — the growth of a sing le crystal layer on a
substrate  of  the  same  material,  homoepitaxy;  or  on  a
substrate  of  different  material  with  compatible  crystal
structure, heteroepitaxy
4. 2  fixed  quality  area  (FQA)  —  (r efer  to  Figure  1  of
SEMI M1) the central area of the wafer surface, defined
by   a   nominal   edge   exclusion,   X,   over   which   the
specified values of a parameter apply.
4. 3  mismatch  —  the  ratio,  m
c
,  defi ned  by  the  lattice
constant  of  the  epitaxial  layer  perpendicular  to  the
surface, c, minus that of the substrate, a
o
divided by the
substrate lattice constant.
m

4. 4  mole  fraction  —  the  normalize d  fraction  of  a
particular  element  occupying  the  same  lattice  site  in  a
compound.  E.g. in the compound A
a
B
b
C
c
D
d
, a, b, c and
d are the mole fractions of the elements A, B, C and D
respectively.    If,  in  this  example,  A  and  B  share  the
same  lattice  site,  and  C  and  D  share  the  other  lattice
site, then by definition the sum of a and b, and the sum
of c and d each must be 1.
4. 5  graded  layer  —  a  layer  whose   properties  vary
smoothly  in  the  direction  perpendicular  to  the  surface.
The  properties  of  a  graded  layer  are  specified  in  terms
of  the  parameters  at  the  top  (last  to  grow  surface)  and
bottom  (first  to  grow  surface)  of  the  layer  and  unless
otherwise   specified,   are   expected   to   vary   linearly
between these two end values.

5  Wafer Ordering Informatio n
5. 1   Purchase  orders  for  epitaxial  la yers  must  include
the following items:
5. 1.1  The substrate (as described by  the relevant SEMI
Standard).
5. 1.2  The epitaxy growth method.
5. 1.3   The  nominal  edge  exclusion  u sed  to  define  the
FQA.
5. 1.4   The  composition  of  each  layer   in  terms  of  mole
fraction(s)  and  a  description  of  the  test  method  used  to
measure it and/or calibrate the growth conditions of that
layer.  Note that in the case of a ternary compound, the
purchaser   may   require   that   the   specification   for
mismatch or bandgap energy take precedence over that
for  nominal  composition.    Similarly  in  the  case  of  a
quaternary  compound,  a  specification  of  mismatch  and
bandgap  energy  may  be  preferred.    This  is  because  the
mismatch  and  bandgap  energy,  which  depend  on  the
composition,   are   often   easier   to   measure   than   the
composition directly.
5. 1.5  The thickness of each layer an d a description of
the  test  method  used  to  measure  it  and/or  calibrate  the
growth conditions of that layer.
5. 1.6  The dopant used for each layer .
5. 1.7   The  carrier  concentration  of  ea ch  layer  and  a
description of the test method used to measure it and/or
calibrate  the  growth  conditions  of  that  layer.    In  the
case  of  layers  with  significant  interface  or  surface
depletion,  the  carrier  concentration  refers  to  the  value
that  would  be  observed  in  thicker  layers,  once  the
appropriate   correction   is   applied   for   interface   and
surface depletion effects.
5. 1.8   Optional  Criteria  —  The  follo wing  items  may
also be specified in addition to those listed above.
5. 1.8.1  The mobility of each layer.
5. 1.8.2  The sheet resistance of the epi taxial layers.
5. 1.8.3  The mismatch for each layer.   The test method
must be described.
5. 1.8.4   The  bandgap  energy  for  each  l ayer.    The  test
method must be described.
5. 1.8.5  The sheet carrier concentration  and mobility of
the whole structure.  This is relevant to those structures
where  the  carriers  are  expected  to  redistribute  to  an
adjacent material or interface.
5. 1.8.6  The surface defect density.
5. 1.8.7   The  end  values  and  thickness  o f  each  graded
layer.
5. 1.8.8   The  surface  roughness.  The  tes t  method  must
be described.
5. 1.8.9   The  growth  and  test  methods  o f  a  calibration
structure along with a schedule for the growth of such a
structure.
6  Tolerance Requirements
6. 1    The   tolerance   requirements   for    the   specified
parameter,   unless   otherwise   agreed   to   between   the
supplier  and  purchaser,  are  as  in  Table  1.  Tolerance  is
defined  as  the  allowed  range  of  values  permissible
within  the  FQA  and  includes  variations  due  to  non-
uniformity  and  deviation  from  the  customer’s  target
value.   The   measurement   point   schedule   (map   of
measurement  points)  should  be  agreed  upon  between
the  supplier  and  purchaser.  Three  classifications  are
given for products of varying control needs.

9. 2   The  user  and  supplier  may  agr ee  that  the  material
shall   be   certified   as   “capable   of   meeting”   certain
requirements.  In  this  context,  “capable  of  meeting”
shall signify that the supplier is not required to perform
the  appropriate  tests  in  Section  7;  however,  if  the  user
performs  the  test  and  the  material  fails  to  meet  the
requirement, the material may be subject to rejection.

GUIDE FOR REPORTING WAFER NANOTOPOGRAPHY
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional
Standards  Committee  on  November  22,  2000.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  December  2000;  to  be
published March 2001.
1  Purpose
1. 1   This  guide  provides  a  framewo rk  for  reporting  of
nanotopography surface features on silicon wafers.
2  Scope
2. 1  This guide addresses reporting  the characterization
of  nanotopography  surface  features  found  on  wafer
surfaces.    Nanotopography  is  the  non-planar  deviation
of   the   whole   front   wafer   surface   within   a   spatial
wavelength  range  of  approximately  0.2  to  20  mm  and
within the fixed quality area (FQA).  Typical examples
include dips, bumps or waves on the wafer surface that
vary in peak to valley height from a few nanometers to
a several hundred nanometers.
2. 2   This  guide  provides  a  framewo rk  for  communi-
cating  specific  values  limiting  feature  levels  and/or
densities as agreed upon between suppliers and users.
2. 2.1   Discussion  —  Nanotopograph y  measurements
have  not  been  needed  for  0.25  μm  generation  devices,
but are expected to be required for smaller feature sizes
to meet CMP requirements. Nanotopography on a wafer
surface prior to CMP processes can result in variations
in post-CMP dielectric thickness with potential negative
consequences    for    circuit    performance    and    yield;
features as small as 20 nm (peak to valley) can result in
post CMP discoloration of dielectrics as a result of local
thickness  variation  of  the  remaining  dielectric
1
1
.  Height
variations over specified distances (determined by CMP
issues  and/or  lithography  systems)  need  to  be  properly
controlled  to  assure  that  wafers  are  acceptable  for
selected process steps.  In the case of CMP, the issue is
control   of   film   thickness   variation   introduced   by
nanotopography.  The  metrology  industry  is  building
tools  that  will  measure  and  map  surface  features  at
nanotopography  amplitudes  and  spatial  wavelengths.
Nanotopography   features   are   characterized   by   their
height  variation  within  an  area,  and  are  discriminated
from  other  features  of  similar  height  by  their  spatial
wavelength range.
2. 3   This  standard  does  not  purport   to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish

applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  The reported surface features w ill be influenced by
limitations  and  parameters  of  the  measurement  tool.
These include:
3. 1.1   The  finite  surface  spatial  band width  of  the  tool
and the applied filtering will prevent surface variations
outside    the    bandwidth    of    operation    from    being
measured.      Also,   the   finite   bandwidth   of   filtering
produces non-physical artifacts that may be apparent in
regions where the power in the rejected bands is high.
3. 1.2   Bandwidth  edges  are  not  alwa ys  well  defined.
Measurement results do not always agree well between
systems,  because  different  tool  designs  employ  differ-
ent  geometries  and  operate  them  over  different  spatial
bandwidths.
3. 1.3   All  surface  profiling  measurem ent  systems  have
a  minimum  height  variation  sensitivity  that  will  distort
signals near the noise floor.
3. 1.4   The  reported  shape  of  some  fe atures  may  also
depend  on  the  pixel  grid  orientation  employed  by  the
instrument.
3. 1.5   The  pixel  size  and  sampled  are a  will  affect  the
bandwidth limits.
3. 2    Reported   profiles   also   vary   wi th   interactions
between wafer and tool.  These limitations include:
3. 2.1   Measurements  made  near  the  w afer  edge  may
result  in  false  readings.  Under  certain  conditions,  this
may  cause  incorrect  height  measurement  within  the
FQA.
3. 2.2   Closely  spaced  features  may  b e  counted  as  a
single feature, or as no feature, if the pixel size is larger
than  the  feature,  or  is  larger  than  the  spacing  between
features.      Reported   features   may   result   from   the
combination  of  the  actual  surface  features,  the  manner
in which the wafer is chucked, or be caused by particles
trapped between the wafer back surface and the chuck.
3. 2.3     High-pass    (spatial    frequency)     filtering    is
typically  used  with  these  measurements  to  remove  the
(long-spatial  wavelength)  effects  of  wafer  shape  (such

SEMI M43-0301 © SEMI 20012
as  bow,  warp  and  sori).    This  filtering  may  affect  the
reported results.
3. 3  Nanotopography characterizat ion does not include
microroughness,   which   applies   to   a   shorter   spatial
wavelength range.
3. 4   The  location  of  defective  areas   as  calculated  in
section  6  may  not  coincide  with  the  location  of  the
surface  features  that  lead  to  those  values.    This  may
cause   lack   of   spatial   correlation   between   reported
defective areas and device process defect areas.
3. 5   The  height  map  used  to  create  n anotopography
reports    may    be    affected    by    wafer    shape    and
measurement chuck effects.
4  Referenced Standards
4. 1  SEMI Standards
SEMI    M1        Specification    for    Monocrystalline
Polished Silicon Wafers
NOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be the
latest publications of adopted standards.
5  Terminology
5. 1   fixed  quality  area  (FQA)  [SEM I  M1]  —  the
central  area  of  a  wafer  surface,  defined  by  a  nominal
edge exclusion, X over which the specified values of a
parameter apply.
Discussion:  The  boundary  of  the  FQA  is  at  all  points
the  distance  X  away  from  the  periphery  of  a  wafer  of
nominal  dimensions.  (See  Figure  1).  The  size  of  the
FQA  is  independent  of  the  wafer  diameter  and  flat
length tolerances. For the purpose of defining the FQA,
the  wafer  periphery  at  locations  with  notch  fiducials  is
assumed  to  follow  the  circumference  of  a  circle  with
diameter equal to the nominal wafer diameter.
5. 2   nanotopography,  of  a  wafer  su rface  —  the  non-
planar    deviation    of    a    surface    within    a    spatial
wavelength range of approximately 0.2 to 20 mm.
5. 3     nanotopology,    of    a    wafer    surfa ce    —    see
nanotopography.
5. 4   roughness  [SEMI  M1]  —  the  m ore  narrowly
spaced components of surface texture.
Discussion:  These  components  are  considered  within
defined limits of spatial wavelength (or frequency).
5. 5  spatial   wavelength   —   the   spac ing   between
adjacent peaks of a purely sinusoidal profile.
6  Measurements
6. 1   The  height  map  is  obtained  fro m  a  front-surface
measurement.    An  explicit  reference  plane  is  not  used
for calculating and assigning values.
NOTE 2: Other  methods  of  analyzing  nanotopography  may
require the use of an explicit reference plane.
6. 2     The    high-pass    filter    removes    lo ng    spatial
wavelength     wafer     tilt     and     topography     effects,
effectively creating a global reference surface.
6. 3   Calculation  —  The  calculation   determines  the
peak  to  valley  height  (P-V)  variation  among  the  pixels
included in the analysis area, and assigns that variation
in  nanometers  to  the  center  of  the  analysis  area.  The
calculation  is  performed  for  every  analysis  area  within
the  FQA  of  the  wafer.    These  calculations  may  be
repeated for analysis areas of different dimension D.
NOTE 3: This  calculation  describes  the  “full-analysis  area”
method.  There  is  another  calculation,  the  “partial  analysis
area”  method,  where  the  calculation  is  performed  for  every
analysis  area  whose  center  pixel  is  within  the  FQA  of  the
wafer.  The  partial  analysis  area  method,  not  defined  in  this
document,  is  being  addressed  by  SEMI  for  inclusion  in  a
standard.
6. 4   The  following  measurement  el ements  should  be
reported:
6. 4.1  Filtering
a) Spatial cutoff of high pass filter
b) Type of Filter
c) Pixel spacing
Filtering  is  used  to  remove  long  wavelength  shape
components from the raw height data.
6. 4.2  Analysis Area — Specify this  analysis area’s:
a) Shape, e.g., square, circle, and
b) Dimension D of the analysis area
An  analysis  area  contains  a  pixel  at  its  center    (Figure
1).  The  pixels  within  the  surrounding  analysis  area  of
dimension D,  and  within  the  FQA,  are  used  to  deter-
mine the value assigned to the center pixel location.
6. 4.3   Data  Report  —  Report  one  or   more  of  the
following:
6. 4.3.1  Statistical  Representation  by  T hreshold  Curve
—   Plot,   for   each   D,   %   area   vs.   threshold   T,   in
nanometers, where % area is the ratio of
a) the number of analysis areas whose assigned value
(calculated  per  Section  6.3)  exceeds  the  threshold
T, to
b) the number of pixels within the FQA.
The ratio is expressed as a percentage.

GUIDE TO CONVERSION FACTORS FOR INTERSTITIAL OXYGEN IN
SILICON

This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  Japanese  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  for  publication  by  the  Japan  Regional
Standards  Committee  on  January  11,  2005.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org
January  2005;  to  be
published March 2005.  Originally published March 2001; previously published July 2002.
1  Purpose
1. 1  Over the years numerous calibration factors used to calculate the interstitial oxygen content of silicon from the
peak room-temperature infrared absorption at 1107 cm
−1
have been standardized by several standards development
organizations in various parts of the world.  All such standards have since been revised to use the IOC-88 calibration
factor
1,2
that more correctly relates the true oxygen content of silicon to the absorption peak.  Nevertheless, many of
the old calibration factors remain in common use throughout the industry.
1. 2  This  guide  is  a  compilation  of  the  conversion  and  calibration  factors  used  in  standards  established  by  various
organizations since 1970 for the measurement of interstitial oxygen in silicon.
2  Scope
2. 1  This guide allows the user of the guide to convert quantitative values obtained from one standard to another.
2. 2  Two tables are included in the guide.
2. 2.1  Table 1 gives the calibration factors to relate peak absorption coefficient (cm
–1
) to interstitial oxygen content
in  both  parts  per  million  atomic  (ppma)  and  atoms/cm
3
for  various  standards,  all  of  which  have  been  replaced  by
newer revisions.
2. 2.1.1  These calibration factors are at times referred to by common names as indicated in column 1 of the tables
and at other times by the designation of the (obsolete) standard in which they were standardized (as indicated in the
footnotes to Table 1).  Despite the fact that there is a test method associated with each calibration factor, the detailed
procedures  in  these  test  methods  are  usually  ignored  in  common  practice  and  measurements  are  most  frequently
made with automated (black-box) instruments that have internal algorithms.  Thus, reference to a particular standard
most often indicates only the value of the calibration factor to be used.
2. 2.2  Table 2 gives the conversion factors to convert oxygen concentration of one standard to oxygen concentration
of another standard.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  guides  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.

oxygen only.
6  Conversion Factors Among International Standards
6. 1  Table 1 gives the calibration factors published in various standard test methods for determination of interstitial
oxygen content in silicon by infrared absorption.  The factor to obtain the oxygen concentration in parts per million
atomic is given in column 2 while the factor to obtain the oxygen density in atoms/cm
3
is given in column 3.  The
calibration factors are listed in order from the smallest value to the largest value irrespective of the time frame over
which they were adopted.
6. 2  Table  2  gives  the  factors  to  convert  oxygen  concentration  of  one  standard  to  oxygen  concentration  of  another
standard.  The interstitial oxygen content found by any procedure may be reported in any other standardized scale by
multiplying the value by the appropriate conversion factor in Table 2.  The factors are listed in the same order as in
Table 1.

5. 4.2.3      Optional   information,   as   agreed   to   between
supplier and user, may be included.
5. 5  Secondary Container
5. 5.1    Whether  the  secondary  container  material  is  a
single  use  material  or  a  material  that  can  be  reused
multiple  times  should  be  decided  by  considering  the
transport  environment  to  minimize  the  packaging  cost.
The  same  is  true  for  the  secondary  container  sealing
system.
5. 5.2  The secondary container should be collapsible for
efficient storage and empty transport.
5. 5.3  The materials for the secondary container should
be  recyclable  after  the  designated  number  of  uses  is

be stacked in four layers.
5. 5.4.1  Secondary  Container  Dimensions  —The  outer
size  of  the  secondary  container  shall  be  580  mm  wide
by 500 mm deep by 460 mm high.
NOTE 2:  The specification does not specify tolerances on the
dimensions,  but  the  specified  dimensions  should  be  adhered
to as closely as possible to enhance container stackability.
NOTE  3:    These  values  of  width  (W)  and  depth  (D)  are
selected  to  allow  four  containers  to  be  placed  on  the  world
wide standard pallet (1200 mm by 1000 mm).
NOTE  4:    The  value  of  height  (H)  is  selected  to  allow  three
layers to be stacked in a standard airfreight container.
NOTE  5:    The  outer  dimensions  of  the  secondary  container
should   be   determined   considering   the   requirements   of
Sections  5.1  (wafer  shipping  box)  and  5.2  (bagging  system)
and  allowance  for  cushioning  thickness  sufficient  to  prevent
wafer breakage by accidental drop from a height of 800 mm.
NOTE   6:      Height   (H)   can   be   negotiated   between   wafer
supplier and user, if the proposed specification is not satisfied
for either the supplier or the user.
5. 5.5      The   number   of   wafer   shipping   boxes   per
secondary     container     must     allow     for     optimal
transportation costs.
5. 5.6  Ergonomic considerations should be made for the
secondary  container,  and  should  be  compatible  with
manual  handling.  When  handling  very  large  quantities,
a supplemental handling system is necessary.
5. 5.7  The secondary container design is not required to
provide    specific    weather    protection.    The    storage
environment should not be affected by the weather.
5. 6  Cushions
5. 6.1    Whether  the  cushion  material  is  a  single  use
material or a material that can be reused multiple times
should    be    decided    by    considering    the    transport
environment to minimize the packaging cost.
5. 6.2    For  the  sake  of  efficiency  during  holding  and
transport,  it  is  preferable  to  have  only  one  or  two
cushions per secondary container.
5. 6.3        The    materials    for    the    cushions    should    be
recyclable   after   the   designated   number   of   uses   is
completed.
5. 7  Pallet
5. 7.1    Pallets  must  be  stand-alone  components  and  are
not integrated with secondary containers.
5. 7.2    Considering  space  efficiency  of  ocean  freight
containers,  it  is  preferable  that  the  pallet  size  be  1130
mm max on at least one side.
5. 7.3    Palletized  containers  must  be  banded  and  film-
wrapped.
5. 7.4    Pallet  material  must  meet  transportation  industry
requirements  and  allow  for  reuse  and  recycle  after  end
of useful life.
5. 7.5    Pallets  must  be  able  to  be  accessed  by  a  forklift
from at least two directions.
5. 8  Shipment Documentation
5. 8.1      English   should   be   used   for   all   international
shipment  documentation.  The  local  language  may  be
used only for domestic shipments only.
5. 8.2    Packing  list  and  customs  invoice  (if  required)
should be located on the outside of container number 1
with   a   sufficient   number   of   copies   to   ensure   the
customer receives one copy.
5. 8.3          Customs     invoices     must     meet     appropriate
government  regulations.    Key  content  items  are:  PO
number,  product  description,  price,  shipping  address,

TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN
EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING
This  test  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Compound  Semiconductor  Committee  and  is  the
direct  responsibility  of  the  European  Compound  Semiconductor  Materials  Committee.  Current  edition
approved  by  the  European  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  June  29,  2001.    Initially  available  at
www.semi.org December 2001; to be published March 2002.

This document was editorially modified in November 2001 to correct a typographical error.  A change was
made to Section 7.3.3.
1  Purpose
1. 1      The   purpose   of   this   document   is   to   specify   a
method to measure the carrier concentration and carrier
concentration  vs.  depth  profile  of  epitaxial  layers  by
Electrochemical Capacitance Voltage ECV profiling.
2  Scope
2. 1  This test method covers a procedure for measuring
the  carrier  concentration  of  epitaxial  layers  by  ECV
profiling.   This   method   focuses   on   improving   the
accuracy   and   repeatability   of   the   measurement   by
standardizing  the  test  conditions  and  reporting  and  by
routine calibration of the measurement.
2. 2    This  test  method  is  intended  to  cover  the  majority
of  routine  samples  measured.  However,  because  of  the
number  of  different  materials  encountered  it  cannot
cover every contingency.
2. 3    This  standard  may  involve  hazardous  materials.
This standard does not purport to address safety issues,
if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of
the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety
and  health  practices  and  determine  the  applicability  of
regulatory limitations prior to use.

epitaxial layer is measured by the CV method.
5. 1.1  Ohmic contacts are formed on the sample.


SEMI M46-1101
E
© SEMI 2001 2
5. 1.2    A  rectifying  barrier,  of  known  contact  area,  is
formed   by   placing   the   sample   in   contact   with   an
electrolyte.
5. 1.3    The  quality  of  the  barrier  is  assessed  using  I-V
and C-V measurements.
5. 1.4        From    the    measured    C-V    data    the    carrier
concentration of the layer is determined.
5. 1.5  The sample is anodically etched to produce a new
barrier   deeper   in   the   material.   The   etch   depth   is
determined using Faradayís law of electrolysis.
5. 1.6    Sections  5.1.4  and  5.1.5  are  repeated  to  generate
a carrier concentration vs. depth profile.
6  Interferences
6. 1  Thin  Layers  ó  Diffusion  of  carriers  into  adjacent
regions   set   a   fundamental   resolution   limit   to   the
measurement.  In  addition  if  the  layer  has  a  high  sheet
resistivity this can also affect the value obtained.
6. 2        Double    Layer    Capacitance    ó    A    limitation
imposed      by      the      physical      nature      of      the
electrolyte/semiconductor  barrier  which  sets  an  upper
limit to the measured carrier concentration, for accurate
measurements,  of  1  ◊  10
19
cm
-3
. The  technique  can  be
used    beyond    this    value,    but    with    progressive
degradation.
6. 3  Etch Well Uniformity
6. 3.1  Etch  Well  Flatness  ó  Non-uniformity  increases
the  effective  area  and  may  result  in  the  measurement
not  being  wholly  made  in  the  layer  of  interest.  The
main   causes   of   non-uniformity   are   gas   bubbles,
inadequate     electrolyte     circulation     and     uneven
illumination.
6. 3.2  Etch  Well  Roughness  ó  indicates  poor  etching
and   has   a   deleterious   effect   on   the   measurements.
Generally  overcome  by  selecting  a  more  appropriate
electrolyte and/or etching conditions.
6. 4  Non-Ideal Electrical Characteristics
6. 4.1  Series  Resistance  ó  From  the  contacts,  sample
and electrolyte affect the accuracy of the measurements.
This  effect  is  minimized  by  using  a  highly  conductive
electrolyte,  making  large  area  ohmic  contacts  and  by
employing a low measurement frequency.
6. 4.2  Leakage   Currents   ó   Parallel   conduction   can
affect the accuracy of the measurement.  Its influence is
reduced by employing a high measurement frequency.
6. 4.3  Large  Excess  Area  —  Can  give  rise  to  errors  on
n-type   material   particularly   when   profiling   Hi-Lo
structures.  The  excess  area  is  electrolyte  dependent  but
is  mainly  affected  by  the  quality  of  the  seal  used  to
define the area. Large excess areas indicate a poor seal
and are corrected by replacing the seal.
6. 5  Hi-Lo  Structures  —  Measurement  is  subject  to
inaccuracy  due  to  carrier  diffusion  and  excess  area
errors.  For  accurate  measurements,  chemically  etch  to
the layer of interest before measurement.
6. 6  Contact  Quality  ó  Non-Ohmic  or  high  resistance
contacts  have  a  deleterious  effect  on  the  measurement.
Contacts should be checked by measuring the resistance
between  two  similar  contacts  and  then  reversing  the
current direction and repeating the measurement.
6. 7  Surface  and  Deep  States  ó  Cause  the  measured
capacitance    to    be    frequency    dependent    and/or
dependent  on  the  rate  at  which  the  bias  is  changed.
Usually    resolved    by    using    a    high    measurement
frequency.   This   should   not   be   confused   with   the
frequency  dependence  which  is  more  usually  attributed
to high series resistance.
6. 8  Surface  Films  ó  Have  a  deleterious  effect  on  the
capacitance  measurement.  Film  formation  should  be
avoided  by  using  an  appropriate  electrolyte,  control  of
the etching bias and time and by electrolyte circulation.
6. 9  Surface  Roughness ó  The  surface  of  the  sample
should be smooth and free of features that would affect
the action of the seal.
6. 10  Light ó    Light    can    affect    the    capacitance
measurement,  so  the  sample  must  be  placed  in  a  dark
environment during the measurement.
6. 11  Sample    Loading    ó    The    accuracy    of    the
measurement depends on the repeatability of the area. If
a  compliant  seal  is  involved,  such  as  a  plastic  ring,  the
sample  should  be  held  in  contact  with  the  seal  by
applying  a  controlled  and  constant  force.  No  relative
lateral  movement  should  take  place  during  the  loading
process.
6. 12  Ring Variability ó The condition of the ring has a
large effect on the measurement. Good seals will have a
small to zero excess area and exhibit a well defined and
reproducible contact area.
7  Apparatus
7. 1  Measurement  of  Etch  Well  and  Ring  Areas ó
Measuring  microscope  with  either  an  XY  stage,  with  a
linear resolution of 0.01 mm or better, or a camera and
image  processing  system  capable  of  measuring  an  area
of 0.1 cm
2
to better than 0.5%.
7. 2  Measurement  of  Etch  Well  Flatness  ó  (Optional)
A  means  such  as  a  stylus  profiler  for  checking  the
flatness  and  roughness  of  the  etch  well.  In  most  cases
visual  inspection  of  the  etch  well,  for  a  mirror  like
appearance, is sufficient indication of low roughness.

values   up   to   300   nF,   employing   a   test   signal   of
amplitude  less  than  100  mV  RMS.  The  measurement
frequency should be typically between 1 and 100 kHz.
7. 3.2  Equivalent  Circuit  Model  ó  The  meter  should
assume      a      parallel      circuit      model      for      the
electrolyte/semiconductor     interface     and     provision
should  be  made  to  compensate  for  the  large  series
resistance of the electrolyte and contacts.

7. 4.1.1  Sealing   Ring   ó   A   corrosion   resistant   ring
which  forms  a  seal  between  the  electrolyte  and  the
sample.  This  ring  defines  the  measurement  area  which
should  be  reproducible  and  well  defined.  The  ring  area
should    not    be    less    than    0.008    cm
2
and    the
reproducibility  between  runs  should  be  better  than  ±
3%. Large ring areas (typically ≥ 0.1 cm

9  Safety Precautions
9. 1    The  electrolytes  used  are  potentially  hazardous.
Read    the    Materials    Safety    Data    Sheets    before
attempting   to   prepare   the   electrolytes.   Use   safety


SEMI M46-1101
E
© SEMI 2001 4
eyewear, rubber gloves and protective clothing. Prepare
all electrolytes in a fume hood.
9. 2  Ensure that all electrolytes are correctly labeled.
10  Specimen Preparation
10. 1    The  sample  should  be  free  from  surface  debris
and  scratches.  The  sample  should  be  cleaned  with
deionized (DI) water and dried.
10. 2    To  measure  a  single  layer  or  upper  layer  of  a
multilayered structure, no additional sample preparation
is required.
10. 3    For  a  buried  layer  in  a  multilayered  structure,
measurement  accuracy  is  improved  by  removing  the
overlaying   layers   by   either   the   use   of   selective   or
controlled chemical etches.
10. 4      If   the   upper   layers   cannot   be   removed   by
chemical   etching   then   the   sample   can   be   profiled
electrochemically but in some cases this may reduce the
accuracy of the method.
10. 5    For  conducting  substrates  Ohmic  contacts  should
be  made  to  either  the  front  or  back  of  the  wafer.  For
insulating  substrates  an  Ohmic  contact  should  be  made
to   the   front   of   the   epilayer.   Contacts   are   formed
electrically,   by   alloying   or   by   any   other   suitable
method.  The  quality  of  the  contact  should  be  verified
electrically.
11  Calibration and Standardization
11. 1  Sealing  Ring  ó  Calibration  of  the  sealing  ring
areas   is   performed   using   a   ìblue   sliceî,   made   by
growing  an  anodic  oxide  film  on  a  polished  n-type
substrate.
11. 1.1  The ìblue sliceî is profiled according to this test
method.  Etch  only  the  minimum  amount  necessary  to
see  the  illuminated  area  (typically  0.5  μm).  Flush  the
cell  several  times  with  DI  water  before  removing  the
sample.  Wash  and  measure  the  sample  as  soon  as
possible.
11. 1.2  Wetted Area ó The wetted area is observed due
to  chemical  attack  of  the  oxide  film  and  is  measured
using  a  measuring  microscope  with  cross  hair  eye-
pieces  and  micrometer  XY  stage  or  by  using  a  zoom
camera and image processing system.
11. 1.3  Illuminated  Area  ó  Etches  in  the  light  and
forms  a  well  defined  etch  well,  which  is  measured  as
per the wetted area.
11. 1.4  Calibration Interval ó Regularly check the area
and condition of the sealing ring. For daily use, the ring
areas should be calibrated at least three times a week.
11. 1.5  Replacement ó Rings should be replaced if the
excess area exceeds 10% for rings of area ≤ 0.05 cm
2
or
5%  for  rings  of  area  >  0.05  cm
2
or  if  the  perimeter  is
not uniform.
11. 1.6  Alternative  Calibration  Method  ó  The  areas
can   be   measured   using   known   n   and   p-type   test
samples.   This   method   is   best   suited   for   continual
monitoring   of   the   ring   area   between   ìblue   sliceî
calibrations.
11. 2  Instrumentation       ó       The       bias       voltage,
measurement  frequency  and  capacitance  measurement
should be checked annually.
11. 2.1  Bias  ó  The  bias  voltage  should  be  checked
with a DVM with an input impedance > 1 MOhm.
11. 2.2  Capacitance  ó  The  capacitance  measurement
should    be    checked    using    calibrated    fixed    value
capacitors  covering  the  expected  sample  capacitance
range or from 1ñ100 nF.
11. 2.3  Frequency ó   The   measurement   frequency
should be checked with a frequency counter.
12  Measurement Procedure
12. 1  Choice of Electrolyte ó  An  electrolyte  should  be
selected that forms a rectifying barrier with the sample,
gives a flat, mirror finish etch well and generates only a
small excess area.
12. 2  Sample  Mounting  ó  A  region  of  the  sample
should   be   defined   which   will   form   the   rectifying
contact with the electrolyte. This area can be defined by
some  form  of  sealing  ring  or  mask,  but  it  is  important
that  the  area  of  contact  between  the  electrolyte  and  the
sample  be  precisely  known  and  remain  constant  during
the measurement.
12. 2.1  Sealing Ring ó If the sample is pressed against
a  sealing  ring,  the  seal  must  be  cleaned  with  DI  water
and  dried  before  positioning  the  sample.  If  the  sample
needs repositioning, the sample and sealing ring should
be recleaned and dried.
12. 2.2  Ring Loading ó As the mounting pressure may
effect  the  reproducibility  of  the  measurement  and  the
lifetime  of  the  sealing  ring,  it  must  be  controlled  (e.g.
by   the   reproducible   use   of   a   suitable   compression
spring).
12. 3  Cell  Filling  and  Debubbling  ó  Fill  the  cell,
which  holds  the  sealing  ring  and  other  measurement
electrodes,  with  the  electrolyte.  The  process  of  filling
the cell frequently traps bubbles of air on the surface of
the  sample.  These  bubbles  must  be  removed  before  a
measurement can be made.


SEMI M46-1101

12. 4  Contact  Evaluation  ó  Verify  that  the  contacts,
for   both   directions   of   current   flow   have   low   and
approximately equal resistance.
12. 5  Rest   Potential   ó   Measure   the   sampleís   rest
potential  to  verify  that  the  reference  electrode  and
sample  are  electrochemically  stable.  Its  value  usually
lies between 0 and −1 V (respective to a SCE reference
electrode).  Values  outside  this  range  can  indicate  a
problem with the sample or reference electrode.
12. 6  Cable   Compensation   ó   Determine   any   stray
capacitance  or  additional  resistance  associated  with  the
cell and test leads that would impact the measurement.
12. 7  Current  vs.  Voltage  (I-V)  ó  Used  to  select  the
bias  for  measurement  and  etching  and  as  a  general  test
of material quality.
12. 7.1  Measurement  Bias  ó  is  set  in  the  reverse  bias,
low dark current region.
12. 7.2  Etching  Bias  (p-type  material)  ó  is  set  in  the
forward bias region. The abruptness of the forward bias
breakdown  is  indicative  of  the  ohmic  nature  of  the
contacts.   No   or   shallow   forward   breakdown   often
indicates unsuitable ohmic contacts.
12. 7.3  Etching  Bias  (n-type  material)  ó  is  set  in  the
reverse   bias,   low   dark   current   region.   Illumination
should result in a significant increase in current (photo-
current).
12. 8  Capacitance   vs.   Voltage   (C-V)   ó   Used   to
evaluate the quality of the electrochemical diode and to
select  a  range  of  possible  measurement  voltages.  The
measured   flatband   potential   (respective   to   a   SCE
reference   electrode)   should   lie   between   −0.5   and
−2.5  V  for  n-type  semiconductors  and  between  ñ1  and
+1 V for p-type semiconductors.
12. 8.1  Measurement  Bias  ó  is  set  in  a  region  of  low
dissipation,  where  the  1/C
2
vs  V  plot  is  linear.  For
layers  grown  with  concentration  gradients,  the  latter
condition  cannot  be  strictly  adhered  to  and  in  such
cases   the   amplitude   of   the   test   signal,   used   for
capacitance  measurement,  should  be  kept  as  small  as
possible.
12. 8.2  Dissipation ó The normally accepted safe level
is < 0.4.
12. 8.3  Excess  Area  Capacitance  ó  For  n-type  surface
layers  the  capacitance  of  the  electrolyte/semiconductor
interface    is    measured    prior    to    etching    and    the
capacitance associated with the excess area is computed
by multiplying the measured capacitance by the ratio of
the excess area to the wetted area.
12. 9  Carrier  Concentration  Profiling  ó  Profile  the
sample  using  the  etching  and  measurement  conditions
determined from the I-V and C-V data.
12. 9.1  Carrier      Concentration      ó      The      carrier
concentration is determined from the C-V data.
12. 9.2  Excess  Area  Correction  ó  For  n-type  material
the  capacitance  associated  with  material  in  the  excess
area    should    be    subtracted    from    the    measured
capacitance.
12. 9.3  Etching  ó  The  sample  is  anodically  etched  at
the   etching   bias.   The   depth   of   the   etch   well   is
determined  from  the  time  integral  of  the  current  using
Faradayís law of electrolysis.
12. 9.4  Profiled  Depth  ó  The  profile  assumes  that  the
measured  carrier  concentration  lies  at  a  depth  equal  to
the sum of the etch and the depletion depths.
12. 10  Ring  Area  ó  It  is  advised  to  measure  the  etch
well   area   after   profiling   and   to   use   this   value   to
recalculate the carrier concentration vs. depth profile.

4. 2.1  BOX ó buried oxide layer
4. 2.2  SIMOX ó separation by implanted oxygen
4. 3  Definitions
4. 3.1  bonded interface — the plane where the bonding
between handle and device wafers takes place.
4. 3.2  bonded  wafer  —  an SOI wafer made by bonding
two  silicon  wafers  with  an  insulating  layer  between
them. The insulating layer is typically thermally grown
oxide.
4. 3.3  BOX   pin-hole   ó   electrically   conductive   path
through the BOX.
4. 3.4  buried  oxide  layer  —  the  silicon  dioxide  layer
between SOI layer and base silicon substrate.
4. 3.5  handle   wafer   or   base   silicon   wafer   or   base
silicon  substrate  ó  the  substrate    which  structurally
supports the BOX and the SOI layer.
4. 3.6  HF defect ó defect in the SOI layer decorated by
immersing the wafer in HF for a certain time.
4. 3.7  non-SOI  edge  area — an  annulus  between  the
nominal  radius  of  the  surface  silicon  layer  and  the
nominal  radius  of  the  base  silicon  wafer  (for  bonded
SOI  wafers).  The  annulus  which  implies  an  area  is
determined  by  its  width  as  one  dimension.  It  is  the
difference  in  the  nominal  radius  of  the  surface  silicon
layer and the base silicon wafer.

8  Test Methods
8. 1  Thickness  of  Surface  Silicon  Layer  and  Buried
Oxide Layer
8. 1.1  Measurement Methods  Two non-contact, non-
destructive      optical      characterization      techniques,
spectroscopic   ellipsometry   (SE)   and   spectroscopic


SEMI M47-0704 © SEMI 2001, 2004 6
reflectometry,   have   proven   useful   both   for   surface
silicon  layer  and  buried  oxide  (BOX)  layer  thickness
measurements.  Both  techniques  use  reflected  light  to
allow deduction of the thickness and refractive index of
thin  layers.  In  both  cases,  layer  thickness  and  index  of
refraction  data  must  be  ìbacked  outî  of  the  measured
optical  data  by  a  process  of  successive  approximation.
Silicon   islands   in   the   BOX   layer   of   SIMOX   and
interface  non-uniformity  make  these  techniques  less
reliable.
8. 1.1.1  Spectroscopic  Ellipsometry  (SE)  Measurement
ó  In  this  measurement,  white  light  from  a  xenon  arc
lamp  passes  through  a  polarizing  rotating  filter  and
illuminates  the  sample  site  under  study;  reflected  light
passes  through  an  analyzer  to  a  monochrometer  and
photomultiplier     detector.     For     each     wavelength,
reflectivity    oscillates    with    polarizer    rotation;    the
magnitude   and   phase   of   reflectivity   changes   are
measured  to  determine  ellipsometric  angles,  δ  and  Ψ.
The   two   measured   spectra   are   fit   by   successive
approximation  to  allow  determination  of  the  surface
silicon   layer   and   BOX   layer   thickness   and   oxide
composition.  For  SE,  the  choice  of  instrument  and
associated   model   and   fitting   parameters   affect   the
confidence-of-fit,  so  they  should  be  taken  into  account
in the user-supplier agreement.
8. 1.1.2  Spectroscopic  Reflectometry  Measurement  ó
In  this  measurement,  light  from  a  xenon  arc  lamp
passes  through  a  grating  monochrometer  or  optical
band-pass  filters  and  illuminates  the  sample  site  under
study; reflected light is gathered by a detector. Specular
reflectivity  is  plotted  as  a  function  of  wavelength  from
0. 4  μm  to  1.1  μm.  The  analysis  proceeds  by  making
successively    better    approximations    to    index    of
refraction   and   absorption   of   each   layer   until   an
acceptable fit is achieved. Measurements are made with
a reflectance mode optical interferometer.
8. 1.1.3  Optical   Model   Fitting   and   Correlation   ó
There  are  slight,  systematic  differences  between  layer
thickness     measured     by     SE     and     spectroscopic
reflectometry.   Because   of   this,   users   and   suppliers
should  specify  the  actual  measurement  method  to  be
used.   The   two   methods   offer   results   which   are
reproducible and well-correlated with each other over a
wide    range    of    conditions.    If    both    measurement
techniques   are   used,   it   is   recommended   that   the
reflectance  system  measurements  should  be  calibrated
to fit the results of the SE.
8. 1.2  Measurement   Positions    The   measurement
strategy  is  to  make  a  detailed  measurement  with  an
accurate fit on at least nine wafer sites, for example, the
wafer center, four points at half of the wafer radius and
four points at 10 mm from the wafer edge. The number
and  position  of  wafer  sites  to  be  monitored  should  be
agreed  on  between  users  and  suppliers.  Generally,  the
greater  the  variability  relative  to  the  mean,  the  larger
the  number  of  sites  that  should  be  monitored.  In  each
case, the measurement system supplies a ìgoodness-of-
fit" parameter that indicates a level of confidence in the
fit to the measured data.
8. 1.3  Surface  Silicon  Layer  and  Buried  Oxide  (BOX)
Layer   Thickness   ó   Spectra   for   each   site   are   fit
independently  with  both  the  surface  silicon  and  BOX
layer thickness as adjustable parameters. Both the mean
thickness and the uniformity should be specified.
8. 1.4   Surface Silicon Thickness Mean Value Variation
8. 1.4.1        After    surface    silicon layer    thickness    is
measured  for  predetermined  number  of  wafers  and
mean  value  of  surface  silicon  thickness  is  derived  for
each wafer, the maximum and the minimum values are
chosen, and then the variation (nm) is calculated as;
± (Maximum mean value ñ Minimum mean value) / 2
8. 1.4.2    In  case  of  quite  large  number  of  wafers    (ex.  a
few hundreds), the variation (mm) can be calculated as;
± 3σ (3 times of the standard deviation)
under agreement between users and suppliers.

8. 1.5  Surface Silicon Thickness Variation in Wafer
8. 1.5.1        After    surface    silicon    layer    thickness    is
measured  at  predetermined  number  of  points  within  an
SOI  wafer,  the  maximum  and  the  minimum  values  are
chosen, and then the variation (nm) is calculated as ;
± (Maximum value ñ Minimum value) / 2
8. 1.5.2  In case of multi-points measurements (ex. a few
hundreds)  within  an  SOI  wafer,  the  variation  (nm)  can
be calculated as;
± 3σ (3 times of the standard deviation)
under agreement between users and suppliers.

8. 1.6   Buried Oxide (BOX) Thickness Variation
8. 1.6.1        After    BOX    thickness    is    measured    for
predetermined   number   of   points   on   predetermined
number  of  wafers,  the  maximum  and  the  minimum
values   are   chosen,   and   then   the   variation   (%)   is
calculated as;
± (Maximum value ñ Minimum value) ◊ 100 / (2 ◊
mean value)
8. 1.6.2  In case of multi-points measurements (ex. a few
hundreds) within an SOI wafer or quite large number of
wafers    (ex.  a  few  hundreds),  the  variation  (%)  can  be
calculated as;
± 3σ (3 times of the standard deviation) ◊ 100 / (mean
value)
under agreement between users and suppliers.

8. 2  Dopant Concentration
8. 2.1      Secondary   Ion   Mass   Spectroscopy   (SIMS)   is
utilized  to  determine  dopant  concentration  in  surface
silicon layer.
8. 2.2    The  acceptable  dopant  concentrations  are  to  be
determined by agreement between users and suppliers.
8. 3  Defects in Surface Silicon Layer
8. 3.1  SOI Etch Pit
8. 3.1.1      Defects   in   surface   silicon   layer   including
stacking  faults,  threading  dislocations  and  other  crystal
defects  are  evaluated  by  destructive  chemical  etching
and  microscopic  etch  pit  density  measurements.  The
appropriate evaluation procedure for SOI wafers, which
depends  on  type  of  defects  targeted  and  thickness  of
surface   silicon   layers,   is   determined   by   agreement
between users and suppliers.
8. 3.1.2    Following  are  examples  of  the  evaluation  on
SIMOX wafers and bonded wafers.
8. 3.1.3  Example   1   ó   SOI   etch   pit   evaluation   in
SIMOX  wafers:  Samples  are  first  immersed  in  HF  to

both  cases,  the  etching  should  continue  until  50  nm  of
the surface Si remains.  After the etching and rinsing in
water,  samples  are  dipped  in  HF  (49%)  for  5  minutes.
The  HF  etches  the  buried  oxide  and  creates  cavities
under the etch pits.  The number of etch pits is counted
through  optical  microscope.    The  etch  pits  include
various   defects   such   as   threading   dislocations   and
stacking fault pyramid.
8. 3.1.4  Example 2 — SOI etch pit evaluation in bonded
SOI  wafers  fabricated  by  delamination  followed  by
CMP:  SOI  etch  pit  density  increases  when  remaining
SOI   thickness   after   Secco   etching   is   thinner   and
thinner.  SOI  layers  thicker  than  150  nm  are  usually
etched  down  to  50  nm  by  Secco  etching  before  SOI
etch  pits  are  counted.  These  pits  are  detected  when
selectively  etched  depth  or  the  size  of  defects  is  larger
than SOI layer thickness remaining after Secco etching.
Thus, damages deeper than 50 nm or defects larger than
50  nm  can  be  detected.  These  pits  come  from  defects

and Physics, vol.35, p. 129, 1993.
contained in original silicon material and/or damages or
defects induced in SOI fabrication process. The former
includes  COP,  bulk  micro  defects,  oxygen  precipitates,
and  so  on.  The  latter  includes  CMP  damages,  defects
induced  by  heat  cycles  and  so  on,  as  possibility.  To
define  origins  of  SOI  etch  pits,  their  distribution  in
depth  of  SOI  layers  and/or  that  on  a  wafer  should  be
evaluated.   For   example,   CMP   damages   may   be
localized  on  surface  of  SOI  layers.  By  etching  SOI
surfaces  up  to  desired  depth  with  using  non-selective
etching  such  as  KOH  followed  by  Secco  etching,  etch
pits   due   to   CMP   damages   disappear.   The   depth
distribution  of  defects  or  damages  can  be  evaluated  in
this manner.

8. 3.1.5  Example 3 — SOI etch pit evaluation in bonded
SOI    wafers    formed    by    epitaxial    layer    transfer
technology:  In  this  case,  there  is  no  COP,  bulk  micro
defects,   and   oxygen   precipitates   in   the   SOI   layer
because it is made of epitaxially grown Si on porous Si.
In  addition,  mechanical  damage  related  defect  is  not
introduced,  since  the  SOI  surface  is  smoothed  out  by
hydrogen  annealing  instead  of  polishing.  The  major
defect   in   this   type   of   SOI   wafers   is   same   sided
pyramidal  stacking  fault,  that  is  induced  at  the  initial
stage  of  the  epitaxy,  and  is  grown  through  the  epitaxy
with upside-down pyramidal shape
7
,  and  then  is  turned
upside-down again by bonding. This defect is decorated
as the etch pit by standard or diluted Seccoís etching as
described   in   Example   1   in   conjunction   with   HF
dipping.  It  is  enough  to  etch  until  50  nm  of  the  SOI
layer  remaining  to  etch  the  defect  portion  through  the
SOI  layer  selectively  by  the  defect  etching  such  as
Secco  etching  because  the  stacking  fault  penetrates
through  the  SOI  layer.    The  following  HF  dipping
etches  the  BOX  through  the  etch  pit  to  form  large
cavity. It helps to count low density of defects in a wide
observation area with low magnification microscope.
8. 3.2  Threading Dislocation
8. 3.2.1      The   etching   of   the   SIMOX   sample   shown
above  in  Section  8.3.1.3  (Example  1)  is  terminated
when  the  remaining  surface  silicon  layer  thickness  is
1/3ñ1/2 of the initial thickness and then dipped in HF as
the  same  manner  as  Example  1.    In  this  case  the  etch
pits  include  mainly  threading  dislocations  only  which
can be counted through optical microscope.
8. 3.3  HF Defect
8. 3.3.1      Measurement   of   the   microscopic   etch   pit
density  following  an  HF  etch  is  commonly  used  to
disclose  defects  in  SOI  material.  Pitting  of  surface

silicon may be present before the HF etch or be caused
by  HF  etching.  For  this  destructive  measurement,  a
whole wafer or at least one quarter of a wafer should be
used.  The  sample  is  placed  in  concentrated  (49%)  HF
for 10 to 15 minutes or diluted (e.g. 25%) HF for longer
time (e.g. 3 to 4 hours), then removed, rinsed and dried.
If  there  are  pits  or  voids  and/or  metal  particles  or
silicides  formed  in  the  surface  silicon  layer,  the  HF
etches  the  metals/silicides  and  then  etch  the  buried
oxide. This results in local etching of BOX with 25−50
μm  diameter  (depending  on  the  HF  concentration  and
the  etch  time)  centered  on  the  original  defects.  The
defect    density    is    then    measured    in    an    optical
microscope  using  a  5◊  objective  and  10◊  eyepiece  or
comparable  setup.  The  samples  should  be  scanned  for
whole surface within edge exclusion boundary.
8. 3.4  Void
8. 3.4.1    Voids  are  determined  as  an  unbonded  area  on
bonded SOI wafers. See SEMI M41. Because SOI layer
in thin bonded SOI wafers are typically 0.2 μm thick or
thinner, void areas are broken and SOI layers as well as
BOX  are  usually  absent.  By  this  reason,  voids  are
specified as local absence of SOI layers and/or BOX in
bonded wafers in this specification.
8. 3.4.2  Visual  inspection  ó  Under  visible  light,  the
edge of voids is detected because the edge area is step-
shaped  due  to  absence  of  SOI  layers  and/or  BOX
layers. See Section 8.8 for inspection conditions.
8. 3.4.3  Detection  as  large  LLS  ó  The  edge  of  local
absence   of   SOI   layer   and/or   BOX   scatters   light.
Therefore, voids are detected as large LLS. See Section
8. 7.2 for the principle. A size of LLS corresponding to
various sizes of voids should be calibrated or correlated
by   comparison   of   defects   one   by   one   using   a
microscope.
8. 4  Surface Roughness
8. 4.1  AFM    (Atomic    Force    Microscope)    ó    By
contacting  the  probe  equipped  with  the  cantilever  onto
the  wafer  surface  of  the  sample,  and  by  scanning  the
cantilever   and   detecting   the   variation   by   optical
method,   the   roughness   information   is   obtained.   A
tapping mode is commonly used.
8. 5  Metal Contamination
8. 5.1        The    surface    metal    contamination    can    be
measured by TXRF, AAS and ICP-MS methods.
8. 5.2  TXRF (Total X-Ray Fluorescence) ó Total X-ray
Fluorescence  uses  a  low  angle  incident,  and  a  tightly
collimated X-ray beam excites the characteristic X-rays
from  impurity  atoms  near  the  sample  surface.  Usually,
the angle of X-ray incidence is less than 0.1 degree. The
element  identification  and  the  amount  of  the  element
can be obtained by measuring energy and intensities of
fluorescence  X-ray.  The  instrument  provides  a  map  of
impurity  element  distribution.  Surface  roughness  may
change  metal  detection  sensitivity.  Thus,  calibration  is
suggested   before   samples   with   deferent   level   of
roughness, e.g. back surface, are measured. A reference
for details is SEMI MF1526.
8. 5.3  AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy)
8. 5.3.1    The  elemental  characteristic  absorption  of  the
atom  is  measured  by  introducing  sample  solution  as
aerosol  into  the  flame  and  then  spectral  absorption
through  the  flame  from  the  light  source  is  detected  by
the spectrometer. The flameless method, superior to the
flame method in the sensitivity, is now broadly used.
8. 5.3.2  Sample     Preparation     ó     Careful     sample
preparation  is  necessary  for  the  precise  measurement.
SOI  wafer  surface  is  exposed  to  HF  vapor,  and  metals
on  the  surface  are  collected  as  droplet.    To  improve
sensitivity,  the  volume  of  collective  solution  should  be
as small as possible and HF drops are rolled all over the
surface  in  collective  operation.  In  case  of  precious
metals,  it  is  better  to  use  other  kinds  of  collective
solutions   instead,   since   they   are   not   dissolved   or
collected by HF solution itself.

2.    For Au and Pt ; aqua regia (HNO
3
(68 wt.%)  : HCl
(36 wt.%)  = 1 : 3 volume ratio)
8. 5.4  ICP-MS      (Inductively   Coupled   Plasma   Mass
Spectroscopy)
8. 5.4.1      ICP-MS   is   composed   of   ICP   (Inductively
Coupled  Plasma)  part  as  an  ion  source  and  MS  (Mass
Spectrometer)  part,  which  measures  the  ions  generated
at ICP part. Usually, sample solution is vaporized in the
nebulizer and then finally introduced into Argon plasma
in   the   silica   tube   called   torch   through   the   spray
chamber.   The   sample   is   decomposed,   evaporated,
atomized and then ionized in the Argon plasma. Except
for   few   atoms   that   have   relatively   high   ionization
potential, most of the elements (> 90%) can be ionized.
Ions are identified and measured in amount by the mass
spectrometer.
8. 5.4.2  Sample  Preparation  ó  The  same  method  as
AAS  method  is  applicable.  In  case  of  quantitative
measurement  of  Fe,  since  its  mass  weight  is  close  to
that   of   ArO
+
,   it   is   necessary   to   pay   attention   to
degradation of detection sensitivity.

8. 6  BOX Defect
8. 6.1  BOX  Pinhole  Measurement-1  (by  CuSO
4
plating
or copper decoration)
8. 6.1.1    BOX  pinhole  evaluations  shall  be  made  by
CuSO
4
plating or copper decoration methods.  They can
be    also    evaluated    by    BOX    capacitor    dielectric
breakdown,  the  details  of  which  are  explained  later  in
BOX Pinhole Measurement-2.
8. 6.1.2    In  evaluation  by  CuSO
4
plating  method,  the
sample  wafer  is  placed  (front  face  down)  on  a  paper
towel soaked in 20% CuSO
4
solution on top of a copper
plate.  An  aluminum  plate  is  placed  on  the  back  of  the
wafer.  The  copper  plate  is  grounded,  and  −25  V
DC
is
applied  to  the  aluminum  plate.  Small  leakage  currents
(sub-μA) through pinholes in the BOX cause copper to
plate out onto the towel with the density same as BOX
pinhole density.
8. 6.1.3    In  evaluation  by  copper  decoration  method,  an
SOI layer is first etched off by KOH solution to expose
a  BOX  layer.  Then  the  wafer  is  immersed  in  methanol
and  brought  downward  into  direct  contact  with  the
gold-coated  cathode.  A  copper  mesh  as  an  anode  is
immersed in the liquid 5 mm above the wafer. Required
voltage  is  applied,  such  as  the  electric  field  in  the
buried   oxide   layer   is   1   MV/cm.   The   voltage   is
measured  at  the  oxide  surface  with  a  surface  voltage
probe.  Localized  copper  decorations  at  pinhole  sites  in
the   oxide   are   observed   with   a   low   power   optical
microscope.
8. 6.2  BOX  Capacitor  Dielectric  Breakdown  ó  This
parameter  can  be  measured  with  BOX  capacitor.  The
BOX  thickness  affects  both  the  test  procedure  (such  as
capacitor  area  and  voltage  criterion)  and  the  allowable
values   of   measured   parameters.   These   should   be
determined by agreement between users and suppliers.
8. 6.2.1  Test   Structure   ó   BOX   capacitor   utilizing
mesa-etched  SOI  layers  and  Si  substrates  for  both
electrodes to apply electric field to the embedded buried
oxide is used.  The area of capacitor, which affects the
breakdown voltage, should be determined by agreement
between  users  and  suppliers.    Typical  capacitor  area  is
0. 01ñ0.1  cm
2
.    The  electrode  material  and  thickness
affect the breakdown phenomena due to thermal effects,
and so should be included in the agreement.
8. 6.2.2  Test  Method:  Staircase  I-V  Measurement  ó
Voltage  is  stepped  in  one-volt  increments  from  zero  to
until destructive breakdown is sensed.  The test detects
the  onset  of  high  field  conduction,  as  well  as  the  point
of destructive or massive charge injection and trapping.
8. 6.3  BOX   Pinhole   Measurement-2   (by   Dielectric
Breakdown)
8. 6.3.1    Buried  oxide  pinhole  can  be  detected  also  by
BOX capacitor.
8. 6.3.2  Test Structure ó BOX capacitor having an area
equal to or greater than 0.05 cm
2
.
8. 6.3.3  Test  Method:  Staircase  I-V  ó  Measurement
testing can be done for both Type I and Type II defects
where  Type  I  defects  are  silicon  pipes  traversing  the
buried  oxide,  and  Type  II  defects  are  local  regions  of
thin  buried  oxide.  If  Type  II  defect  density  is  sought,
capacitors  are  subjected  to  a  series  of  30  voltage  steps
of  3.3  volts,  with  current  monitored  after  each  step,
using a failure criterion of 1 nA.
8. 6.3.4    Any  capacitor  displaying  the  failure  current  or
more for applied field less than 2 MV/cm is considered
defective.    Defect  density  of  either  type  is  calculated
from  the  yield  of  good  capacitors,  (Y  =  1  −  #  failed/#
tested), using Poisson statistics;
D = −1n (Y)/A,
where A is the total area of the capacitors tested.
8. 7  Particle   (LLS : Localized Light Scatterer)
8. 7.1  Light  Scattering  Tomography  ó  The  particle
larger  than  predetermined  threshold  size  is  counted  by
an automated particle counter.
8. 7.2  Principle  of  Measurement  ó  By  scanning  the
laser  beam  on  the  wafer  surface,  the  light  scattered  by
particles on a wafer is detected.  The scattered light and
the  noise  from  the  wafer  surface  is  detected  as  a  direct
current,  on  the  other  hand,  the  scattered  light  by  the
particles  can  be  detected  as  pulse  components.    The
particle size can be calibrated with standard polystyrene
latex spheres.  SOI wafers usually have scattering noise
from  the  layer  interface.    It  is  necessary  to  reduce
incident   angle   of   the   laser   beam   to   increase   the
reflective  component  from  the  surface.    For  example,
S/N  ratio  is  improved  when  using  S-polarized  light  of
10  degree  incident,  85%  of  its  component  is  reflected
from silicon surface.
NOTE 2:  Detailed procedure of size calibration with standard
polystyrene latex spheres: Refer to ASTM F1620.
NOTE 3:  Measurement  procedure  should  be  determined  by
agreement between users and suppliers.
8. 8  Visual  Inspection  ó  SOI  wafer  can  be  visually
inspected   in   accordance   with   SEMI   MF523.   The
automatic   inspection   equipment   is   also   used   when
available.    For  visual  inspection,  the  collimated  high
intensity  bright  light  (e.g.  500,000  lux)  is  used.    Under
using  this  light,  SOI  wafer  is  inspected  for  haze,  slip,

GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING
PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional
Standards  Committee  on  August  27,  2001.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  September  2001;  to  be
published November 2001.
1  Purpose
1. 1  The purpose of this document is to provide a guide
for evaluation of chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP)
processes    of    thin    films    on    unpatterned    silicon
substrates.    This  includes  recommended  procedures  for
process testing and reporting formats.
1. 2  This guide is intended for use by both suppliers and
end users.
2  Scope
2. 1    This  document  provides  a  guide  for  evaluating  a
CMP  process  for  films  deposited  or  grown  on  an
unpatterned  silicon  substrate.    These  evaluations  could
include  tests  with  fixed  polishing  time,  fixed  removal
rate,  fixed  ending  thickness,  time-dependent  material
removal, and others.
2. 2      Recommended   procedures   for   characterizing   a
CMP process are discussed in this guide.
2. 3  This guide suggests selected parameters and values
of the properties of the starting monitor wafer.
2. 4    This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1    The  guide  does  not  address  evaluation  of  CMP
processes for films on patterned substrates.
3. 2          Evaluation     of     surface     quality     or     surface
contamination   is   not   addressed   in   this   document.
Surface quality and surface contamination are important
aspects  of  the  CMP  process  evaluation  but  they  are
beyond the scope of this guide.
3. 3    This  guide  employs  sample  standard  deviation  to
estimate variation.
3. 4    Wafer  positioning  precision  on  a  metrology  tool
can  affect  the  precision  of  the  polishing  evaluation.
This issue is not addressed in this standard.
3. 5    The  values  derived  from  the  calculations  in  this
guide  are  sample-dependent.    They  are  affected  by
measurement location and number of observations.

5  Terminology
5. 1  blanket  polish  ó  polishing  of  material  deposited
on an unpatterned silicon substrate.
5. 2  diameter  scan  ó  measurements  of  material  on  a
wafer  taken  along  a  specified  diameter.  The  diameter
scan is useful in determining the thickness profile of the
material on the wafer surface.
5. 3  edge scan ó measurements of material taken along
a  specified  radial  segment  in  the  edge  region  of  the
wafer.    A  series  of  edge  scans  can  be  employed  to
determine circumferential thickness profile.
5. 3.1  Discussion  ó  the  data  density  for  edge  scan
measurements   is   generally   higher   than   for   other
measurements.      Combining  a  low-density  diameter
scan  in  the  central  region  of  the  wafer  with  a  higher-
density  edge  scan,  taken  along  the  same  scan  line,  can
improve       throughput       with      appropriate      local
measurement data density.
5. 4  film total thickness variation (film TTV) ó the total
thickness  variation  (Thk
max
−  Thk
min
)  of  film  material
among a set of measurement points.
5. 4.1  Discussion  ó  The  variation  may  pertain  to  a
region  within  a  wafer,  a  complete  wafer  or  multiple
wafers  with  a  single  polish  head,  or  multiple  wafers
with  multiple  polish  heads.    These  wafer  and  head
combinations   must   be   considered   in   planning   and
comparing  measurements.    If  one  assumes  that  a  given
wafer is polished by a subset of the tool heads (typically
one),  a  hierarchical  relationship  exists  such  that  wafers
must be associated with the (tool head) subsets used to
polish  them.    Another  way  to  look  at  this  is,  if  head  is
considered  an  experimental  treatment,  then  a  wafer
polished  by  one  head  will  be  assumed  to  be  treated
differently  than  a  wafer  polished  by  a  different  head.
This relationship leads to what is known as a hierarchic
or  nested  model.    (In  this  case,  one  says  that  wafer  is
nested  within  head).    A  more  complete  model  would
also  treat  head  as  a  fixed  effect,  wafer  random  and
nested within head,  and error as nested with head  and
wafer.    A  random  effect  indicates  that  the  observation
comes  from  a  random  sample  of  a  larger  population.
Head  is  a  fixed  effect  because  the  entire  population  of
heads  (i.e.,  all  the  heads  on  the  tools)  constitutes  the
entire   population   of   interest.      Given   this   model,
variance  components  would  be  used  to  estimate  the
different  sources  of  variation.    In  this  case,  the  sample
standard    deviation    underestimates    the    population
standard  deviation.    Historically,  the  expected  value  of
the  variance  components  is  equal  to  the  population
standard deviation.  This is not the case for the sample
standard deviation.
5. 5  head    to    head    removal    rate    non-uniformity
(HTHNU)  ó  this  metric  is  useful  when  evaluating
polishing  processes  on  a  multi-head  tool  configuration.
It  is  the  standard  deviation  (1σ)  of  the  removal  rate
variation  from  polish  head  (HTH)  to  polish  head  for  a
fixed number of wafers where the number of wafers run
for each head must be equal.  It is expressed as follows:

6  CMP Process Test
6. 1  Introduction
6. 1.1    The  CMP  process  test  should  be  performed  with
attention  to  the  quality  of  both  the  substrate  and  the
incoming film material, and the relative condition of the
consumables and polishing system being utilized.
6. 1.2  The number of wafers within the group should be
specified.
6. 2  Monitor Wafer
6. 2.1  Monitor wafer specifications should be per SEMI
M1 for  incoming  bow,  warp,  total  thickness  variation
(TTV), and edge profile.
6. 2.2    The  geometry  of  the  wafer  may  influence  the
CMP  process  results.    Tables  R-1  and  R-2  in  Related
Information   1   recommend   specifications   for   wafer
geometry   that   can   minimize   the   effects   of   such
geometry on the CMP process test.
6. 2.3    Record  bow,  warp  and  other  wafer  geometry
characteristics.
6. 2.4    Wafers  can  be  laser-marked  for  ease  of  tracking.
Data  taken  in  this  mark  area  should  be  excluded  from
the process analysis.  It is desirable that all wafers in an
evaluation   lot   contain   marks   at   the   same   nominal
locations.
6. 3  Incoming Film Properties
6. 3.1    Record  the  incoming  film  type  and  deposition
tool   and,   where   applicable,   the   deposition   process
conditions.
6. 3.2    Ascertain  that  the  incoming  film  thickness  is
sufficient  to  prevent  polishing  through  to  the  substrate.
See  Tables  R-1  and  R-2  in  Related  Information  1  for
recommended values for incoming film thickness.
6. 4  Post-process Measurements
6. 4.1    Record  bow,  warp  and  the  same  other  wafer
geometry characteristics determined in Section 6.2.3.
NOTE  2:  These  post-process  measurement  values  may  vary
arbitrarily relative to the pre-process values.


SEMI M48-1101 © SEMI 2001 4
6. 4.2  Record final film thickness in the same locations
employed for the starting film.
6. 4.3  Calculate global and local film thickness changes
appropriate for the application of interest.
6. 5  Metrology tools
6. 5.1      Select   a   film   thickness   measurement   system
suitable   for   the   film   and   sampling   pattern   to   be
characterized.
6. 5.1.1    Perform  a  gauge  study  on  each  metrology  tool
accordance    with    SEMI    E89    to    determine    its
effectiveness for the films to be measured.
6. 5.2    Ascertain  that  the  metrology  tool  is  operating
properly  under  Statistical  Process  Control  prior  to  use
in the CMP process test.
6. 5.3  Perform  tool  calibration  in  accordance  with  the
tool supplierís instructions.
6. 6  CMP Consumables
6. 6.1    Identify  all  consumables  including  pad,  insert
film, slurry type, and conditioning end effector.
6. 6.2    Record  the  manufacturerís  part  number  and  lot
number (if available) of each consumable item.
6. 6.3  Record the status and history of each consumable
prior to starting the process test.

NOTE 3: The  history  of  consumables  can  affect  the  CMP
process test.
6. 6.4    Perform  break-in  procedures  for  pad  and  carrier
film as required to ensure stable  operation.    Base  these
break-in   procedures   on   recommendations   from   the
consumable supplier.
6. 7  Polishing Tool
6. 7.1  Calibrate and record polish downforce, alignment
tolerances,   velocity,   fluid   dispense   rates   and   other
operational     parameters     based     on     recommended
procedures from the equipment manufacturer.
6. 7.2  Polish the samples.
7  Measurement Locations on the Wafer
7. 1    The  number  and  location  of  measurement  sites  are
specific to the process test.  In general, locations should
be   evenly   spaced.      Data   extrapolation   beyond   the
boundary  of  the  measurement  site  population  should
not be performed.
7. 2    ASTM  F  1618  covers  a  set  of  site  distribution
patterns for measuring the uniformity of a thin film on a
silicon wafer, similar to Figures 2 ñ 5, as well as simple
procedures  for  analyzing  and  reporting  the  results  of
those  measurements.  For  edge-scan  measurements,  see
Section 7.3.6 below.  For spiral-scan measurements, see
Section   7.3.7   below.      For   full-wafer,   high-density
measurements, see Section 7.3.10 below.
7. 3      Select   one   of   these   patterns   for   CMP   process
analysis on unpatterned wafers, unless otherwise agreed
to.
7. 3.1    Sampling  plans  are  based  on  concentric  circles,
spirals,  Cartesian  sites,  partial-radius,  and  partial  and
single-diameter sites.
7. 3.2    Measurements  are  made  at  the  sites  specified  in
the   chosen   sampling   plan,   using   the   appropriate
instrumentation  and  measurement  procedure  for  the
film parameter of interest.
7. 3.3    Measures  of  the  dispersion  of  the  values  are
obtained by simple statistics specified for the sampling
plans.
7. 3.4    For  diagonal  scan  measurements,  refer  to  Figure
1.      Select   values   for   each   of   the   following   scan
parameters:
• Scan Angle, θ
• Scan Radius Start/Stop, r
1
/ r
2

• Number   of   Measurement   Points,   n,   across   the
diameter.
7. 3.5    For  edge  scan  measurements,  refer  to  Figure  6.
Select values for each of the following scan parameters:
• Scan Angle, θ
• Inner Scan Radius, r
1

• Outer Scan Radius, r
2

• Number of Measurement Points, n, between r
1
and
r
2
.
NOTE 4: These n measurement     sites     are     uniformly
distributed.
7. 3.5.1  Discussion  ó  the  data  density  for  edge  scan
measurements   is   generally   higher   than   for   other
measurements.      Combining  a  low-density  diameter
scan  in  the  central  region  of  the  wafer  with  a  higher-
density  edge  scan,  taken  along  the  same  scan  line,  can
improve       throughput       with      appropriate      local
measurement data density.
7. 3.6    For  spiral  scan  measurements,  refer  to  Figure  7.
In  such  scans,  the  measurements  are  evenly  distributed
from  near  the  center  (r  =  0)  to  near  the  edge  exclusion
boundary (r = 1 ñ EE).  For each successive point, both
the  radius  and  the  angle
θ  are  systematically  changed.
For  the  200  mm  example  with  3  mm  edge  exclusion
shown  in  Figure  7,  the  81  measurement  points  start  at


SEMI M48-1101 © SEMI 2001 5
R
1
=  0.10  mm  and  θ
1
=  0.52∞.    Successive  points  are
incremented with
∆R = 1.21 mm and  ∆θ  = 1.16∞.
NOTE 5: Spiral  scans  uniformly  sample  properties  that  are
radially  symmetrical.    These  scans  apply  equal  weight  to  all
measurement  sites.    They  also  provide  radial  information,
similar  to  diameter  scans,  as  well  as  additional  theta-related
information that may not be provided by diameter scans.
7. 3.7  For concentric circle scans, refer to Figures 2 and
3.    In  these  scans,  the  inner  circles  lie  on  a  fraction  of
the nominal radius.  For notched wafers, the outer circle
lies  on  a  radius  equal  to  the  nominal  radius  less  the
edge  exclusion,  which  is  conformal  with  the  notch  on
notched wafers.  For flatted wafers the outer circle lies
on a radius equal to the nominal radius less the sum of
the flat depth plus the edge exclusion.
7. 3.8  For Cartesian measurement scans, refer to Figure
4.
7. 3.9  For  full-wafer  measurements,  the  measurements
sites  are  evenly  spaced  over  the  entire  area  being
examined.  Typically, the first point is the wafer center,
and the remaining measurement sites are equally spaced
about  the  wafer  center  in  X  and  Y.    This  X-Y  grid  is
similar to Figure 4, but with significantly higher spatial
density.
7. 4  Record and identify the measurement site locations
in accordance with SEMI M20.
7. 4.1  Include an illustration of these locations with the
test setup and with the recorded data set.
