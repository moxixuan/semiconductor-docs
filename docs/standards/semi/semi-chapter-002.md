SEMI E10-0304E © SEMI 1986, 20041 SEMI E10-0304 E SPECIFICATION FOR DEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT OFEQUIPMENT RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, AND MAINTAINABILITY(RAM) This specification was technically approved by the Global Metrics Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Metrics Committee. Current edition approved by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on October 15, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org February 2004; to bepublished March 2004. Originally published in 1986; previously published July 2001.E This standard was editorially modified in February 2004 to include changes omitted from the previousedition. Changes were made to Table 1, Table R1-3, and Section R1-7. 1 Purpose1.1 This document establishes a common basis forcommunication between users and suppliers ofsemiconductor manufacturing equipment by providingstandards for measuring RAM performance of thatequipment in a manufacturing environment. 2 Scope2.1 The document defines six basic equipment statesinto which all equipment conditions and periods of timemust fall. The equipment states are determined byfunctional issues, independent of who performs thefunction. The measurement of equipment reliability inthis specification concentrates on the relationship ofequipment failures to equipment usage, rather than therelationship of failures to total elapsed time.2.2 Section 5 (Equipment States) defines howequipment time is categorized. Section 6 (RAMMeasurement) defines formulas for measurement ofequipment performance. Section 7 (UncertaintyMeasurement) gives additional methods for evaluatingthe statistical significance of calculated performancemetrics.2.3 Effective application of this specification requiresthat equipment performance (RAM) be tracked withregard to time and/or equipment cycles. Automatedtracking of equipment states is not within the scope ofthis specification, but is covered by SEMI E58. Clearand effective communication among users and supplierspromotes continuous improvement in equipmentperformance.2.4 The RAM indices in this specification may beapplied directly to non-cluster tools at the wholeequipment and sub-system levels. The RAM indicesmay be applied at the sub-system level (e.g., processmodule) for multi-path cluster tools.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E58  Automated Reliability, Availability, andMaintainability Standard (ARAMS)NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 4 Terminology4.1 Definitions4.1.1 availability  the probability that the equipmentwill be in a condition to perform its intended functionwhen required.4.1.2 cluster tool  a manufacturing system made upof integrated processing modules mechanically linkedtogether (the modules may or may not come from thesame supplier).4.1.2.1 single path cluster tool  a cluster tool withonly one process flow path (as used).4.1.2.2 multi-path cluster tool  a cluster tool withmore than one independent process flow path (e.g.,multiple load ports/load-locks, multiple processchambers of the same type) and used as such.4.1.3 cycle  one complete operational sequence(including unit load and unload) of processing,manufacturing, or testing steps for an equipment systemor subsystem.

This sectiondefines them for the semiconductor industry in amanner that is consistent with existing industrialstandards. Along with the definitions for RAM aregiven indicators by which these measures can bequantified.6.2 EQUIPMENT RELIABILITY  The probabilitythat the equipment will perform its intended function,within stated conditions, for a specified period of time.NOTE 4: Two different methods of measuring this arepresented, productive time (Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2) andequipment cycles (Sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.4): Productive time only considers what happens whilemaking units (useful for manufacturing operationpurposes). Equipment cycles take into account the wear and tearcreated by every machine cycle during all equipmentstates (useful for equipment reliability purposes).6.2.1 MTBF p  Mean (productive) time betweenfailures; the average time the equipment performed its intended function between failures; productive timedivided by the number of failures during that time.Only productive time is included in this calculation.Failures that occur when an attempt is made to changefrom any state to a productive state are included in thiscalculation.

This calculation subtracts only user maintenance delay downtime fromthe period, thereby taking into account supplier delays for parts and service. The intention is to provide an effectiveperformance measurement for use in supplier service contracts. supplier dependent uptime (%) = equipment uptime  100(oper-time  (user maint-delay DT + out-of-spec input DT + fac-rel DT)) 6.3.3 Operational Uptime  The percent of time the equipment is in a condition to perform its intended functionduring the period of operations time.

SEMI E10-0304E © SEMI 1986, 2004 10 7 Uncertainty Measurement7.1 The measures of equipment reliability, availability,and maintainability defined in Section 6 are singlevalue estimates. They do not indicate the uncertainty orprecision of the estimate. Precision varies dependingupon the number of failures observed and the amount ofproductive time contained within the observationperiod.7.2 Precision is described by calculating a lower andupper confidence limit for the MTBFp and presentingthis interval along with the MTBFp point estimate.7.3 These procedures assume that the failure rate isconstant and the times between failures areindependently distributed according to the exponentialdistribution. Therefore, there are no improvement ordegradation trends and it is meaningful to calculateMTBF p . Section 8 applies when the failure timesindicate that a non-constant failure rate is present (forexample, when there is reliability growth ordegradation). Section 8 would typically apply duringprototype reliability improvement testing.7.4 Since MTTR distributions are unlikely to follow anexponential distribution assumption, applying theseprocedures to put confidence limits on MTTR would beinappropriate.7.5 Note that all procedures and tables referred to inthis section apply equally well to measuring theprecision of estimates for similar metrics, where hoursare replaced by cycles or units, for example. Theseprocedures apply to E-MTBFp or E-MCBF in the sameway. It is also appropriate to combine data fromidentical tools being used the same way, in order toimprove the precision of MTBF p estimates.7.6 Calculation of Lower and Upper Confidence Limits To obtain lower and upper MTBFp limits, multiplythe MTBF p estimate by factors obtained by table look-up (Tables A1-1 and A1-2 in Appendix 1). For the casewhen there are zero failures during the measurementperiod, lower confidence limit factors for the MTBFpare given in the first row of Table A1-1 (they multiplythe amount of productive time that had no failures toobtain the desired MTBF p lower limit). There is noupper limit estimate for performance when there arezero failures.7.6.1 Calculation of the MTBFp Lower Limit  UseTable A1-1 in Appendix 1 to obtain a k r;conf factor,where r is the number of failures observed during themeasurement period and conf is the confidence leveldesired. The rows of Table A1-1 correspond todifferent values of r and the columns correspond todifferent values of conf. Confidence levels rangingfrom 80 percent to 95 percent are typical choices. 7.6.1.1 Since the equipment being measured hasdemonstrated (at a given confidence level) that it is atleast as good as the MTBF p lower limit, this lower limitis an important and useful performance statistic, and isoften used contractually.7.6.1.2 Note that the factors in Table A1-1 for 90%confidence are less than 0.5 until the number of failuresequals or exceeds 4. This means that when the numberof failures is under 4, the MTBF P lower limit will beless than half the MTBFp estimate, and confidenceintervals will be wide. From the point of view ofprecision, it is advantageous to have had 4 or morefailures.7.6.1.3 Example: During a given calendar quarter, atool was productive for 1200 hours and had 6 failures.The MTBF p estimate is 1200/6 = 200 hours. A 90percent lower limit factor from Table A1-1(corresponding to r = 6 failures) is 0.570. That meansthat 200  0.570 = 114.0 hours is a 90 percent lowerconfidence limit for the true tool MTBFp.7.6.2 Calculation of the MTBFp Upper Limit  UseTable A1-2 in Appendix 1 to obtain a k r;conf factor,where r is the number of failures observed during themeasurement period and conf is the confidence leveldesired. The rows of Table A1-2 correspond todifferent values of r and the columns correspond todifferent values of conf. Confidence levels rangingfrom 80 percent to 95 percent are typical choices.7.6.2.1 Example: During a given calendar quarter, atool was productive for 1200 hours and had 6 failures.The MTBF p estimate is 1200/6 = 200 hours. A 90percent upper limit factor from Table A1-2(corresponding to r = 6 failures) is 1.904. That meansthat 200  1.904 = 380.8 hours is a 90 percent upperconfidence limit for the true tool MTBFp.7.6.3 Calculation of a Confidence Interval for theMTBF p  Lower and upper 100  (1  /2) confidencelimits for the MTBFp can be combined to give a 100 (1  ) confidence interval. Here /2 is the chance ofmissing on either end of the interval. A 90 percentlower limit has an /2 = 0.1 chance of not being lowenough to capture the true MTBFp, and the same is truefor a 90 percent upper limit. Therefore, a 90 percentlower limit and a 90 percent upper limit combine togive an 80 percent confidence interval. Similarly, a 95percent lower limit and a 95 percent upper limit wouldcombine to give a 90 percent confidence interval.7.6.3.1 Example: During a calendar quarter, a tool wasproductive for 1200 hours and had 6 failures. TheMTBF p estimate is 1200/6 = 200 hours. The 90 percentlower and upper limits are 114 and 380.8 respectively(see Sections 7.6.1 and 7.6.2). The interval (114,

&lt;!-- Page 47 --&gt;

SEMI E10-0304E © SEMI 1986, 200411 380.8) is then an 80 percent confidence interval for thetrue tool MTBFp.7.6.4 Calculation of the MTBFp Lower Bound whenthere are Zero Failures  Use the first row of TableA1-1 (corresponding to r = 0) to obtain a k0;conf factorcorresponding to the desired confidence level. Multiplythe length of the measurement period by this factor toobtain the lower limit estimate.7.6.4.1 Example: During a calendar quarter, a tool wasproductive for 1200 hours and had zero failures. FromTable A1-1, the 90% confidence level lower limit factoris 0.434. That means that 1200  0.434 = 520.8 hours,is a 90% lower confidence limit estimate for the truetool MTBF p.7.6.5 Choosing a test length in order to be able todemonstrate a required MTBF p at a given confidence,we first must pick a maximum number of failures, r,that can occur during the test period and still allow us toconfirm a required MTBFp objective at a givenconfidence level. Next, the length of test time neededcan be calculated using the factors in Table A1-4 inAppendix 1. The required MTBFp is multiplied by afactor based on r and the desired confidence level toobtain the total test time needed.7.6.5.1 Note that minimum test times are obtained byallowing no failures. The cost, however, of using aminimum test length is to increase the possibility of anacceptable tool failing the test by chance. Asmentioned in the discussion in Section 6.2.1, it isadvantageous to design a test that allows up to 4failures, whenever possible.7.6.5.2 Example: We would like to confirm a toolMTBF p of 400 hours at an 80% confidence level. Wewant to be able to pass a qualification test with 4 or lessfailures. We look up the appropriate factor from TableA1-4 and find 6.72. That means the length of test timerequired is 400  6.72 = 2688 hours. We can do this onone tool or split the test time across several tools.When we have accumulated 2688 hours and if 4 or lessfailures have occurred, the MTBFp objective of 400hours will have been confirmed at (at least) the 80%confidence level. 8 Reliability Growth or DegradationMeasurement8.1 The previous calculations are meaningful onlywhen the MTBF p (or MCBF) and E-MTBF p (or E-MCBF) are constant over the measurement period. Ifreliability is improving (typical during designverification and debug and also early life run-in) or ifreliability is degrading (typical near the end of life forthe piece of equipment, or if certain sub-assemblieshave been over-stressed and are wearing out) then anoverall MTBFp calculation is inappropriate andmisleading and other methods must be used. Exacttime of failure recording is required in order to detectreliability improvement or reliability degradationtrends, and to fit appropriate models.8.2 Exact Time of Failure Recording  Clock times offailure must be converted to durations of cumulativeproductive time as measured from the initial productiveuse of the tool (set as time 0). This is easilyaccomplished if total time is continuously monitored byduration within each of the six equipment states.8.2.1 Example: A machine is intended for use duringfirst shift operation five days a week. For simplicity,assume 100% productive utilization. After the firstthree weeks of use, it fails half-way through the day,and is not repaired until the start of the next daysoperation. No more failures occur before the end of thefirst four weeks of operation. The exact time of failureis 124 hours (three weeks of 5  8 = 40 hours per weekplus half of an 8 hour day). If a second failure occurredtwo hours into the third day of the fifth week, the exacttime of failure would be 174 hours.8.3 Reliability Growth (Degradation) Models  Auseful family of reliability growth (degradation) modelswas developed by the U.S. Army Materials SystemsAnalysis Activity. These AMSAA models aredescribed in Appendix 2, along with a general test forreliability growth (degradation) trends. Exact time offailure data is needed to test for trends, fit an AMSAAmodel, and test the fit for adequacy. The failures usedto fit the model must occur during productive time(other failures can occur, but these are not used to fitreliability models).

It offersdetailed information related to Section 7. A1-1 IntroductionA1-1.1 E-MTBF p may be substituted for MTBFp in allcalculations in this section.A1-1.2 Tables A1-1 and A1-2 contain factors thatmultiply an MTBFp point estimate to obtain upper andlower confidence limits. Table A1-1 applies in thecommon case where the equipment is observed for afixed period of time and the number of failures that willoccur is unknown in advance (time censored data). Thealternative is failure censored data, where the numberof failures is specified in advance and the equipment isobserved until that many failures occur. Table A1-3contains lower limit factors for failure censored data.Since failure censored data rarely occurs in tool orequipment reliability measurement, Table A1-3 is onlyincluded for completeness. The upper limit factorsgiven in Table A1-2 apply to both kinds of censoreddata.A1-1.3 Table A1-4 can be used to plan equipmentassessment or qualification tests in order to be able todemonstrate a desired MTBF p at a given confidencelevel. In order to use Table A1-4, you must first choosea maximum number of failures, r, you might observeduring the test period and still be able to meet therequired MTBF p objective. A1-1.4 For reference, here are the formulas for thelower and upper confidence limit factors for timecensored data found in Tables A1-1 and A1-2: MTBFLOWER = 2rX2r +2;12  MTBFp where r =# of failures MTBFUPPER = 2rX2r;2  MTBFp A1-1.5 In both cases, the confidence level is 100  (1 ) that the true MTBF p is above MTBFLOWER and belowMTBF UPPER and chi square distribution tables are used.A1-1.6 For 0 fails, use: MTBFLOWER = productive time-log eA1-1.7 Factors to use when there are 0 failures basedon this formula are given in the first row of Table A1-1.A1-1.8 For failure censored data, MTBF UPPER is thesame, but the lower limit factor in Table A1-3 is: MTBFLOWER = 2rX2r;1-2  MTBF p
