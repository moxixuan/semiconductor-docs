The  electrode  is  negatively  biased  so  that  the  Si  surface  is  in  accumulation  and  the\nelectric field is applied effectively.  Applied electric field (or voltage) is measured when the oxide leakage current\nreaches a predetermined value (judgment current), in other words when the gate oxide breaks down.  The influence\nof COPs on gate oxide breakdown can be estimated from the distribution of breakdown electric field.\n5  Summary of Method\n5. 1  Overview \u2014 This test method consists of two parts.  The first one is the fabrication of a number of similar MOS\ncapacitors  on  silicon  wafers,  and  the  second  one  is  the  measurement  of  the  electric  charge  injected  just  before  the\ndielectric breakdown of the MOS capacitors.  To measure the injected electric charge, the voltage applied to a MOS\ncapacitor is controlled so that the current is kept constant.  The voltage is monitored throughout the test, and the time\nfrom the beginning to a sudden voltage drop which results from the dielectric breakdown of the silicon dioxide film\nis measured.  The injected electric charge is the product of the measured time and the gate current density.\n5. 2  MOS  Capacitor  Fabrication  Process  \u2014  Many  MOS  capacitors  are  formed  on  the  test  wafer.    The  MOS\nfabrication process consists of wafer cleaning, thermal oxidation, poly-Si deposition, phosphorous doping, activation\nheat  treatment,  photolithography  and  etching,  in  the  case  of  using  poly-Si  electrodes.    The  details  of  the  MOS\ncapacitor  fabrication  process  are  shown  in  SEMI  M51.    When  materials  other  than  poly-silicon  are  used  for\nelectrodes, the process shall be adjusted to the material used.  Although thermally grown 20\u201325 nm-thick gate oxide\nfilms  are  recommended  in  SEMI  M51,  oxide  films  as  thin  as  10  nm  can  be  used  depending  on  the  situation.\nHowever,  measurement  shall  be  performed  carefully  for  oxide  films  thinner  than  3  nm,  because  breakdown\njudgment  becomes  difficult  under  the  influence  of  direct  tunneling  current.    See  SEMI  C3.6,  SEMI  C3.54,  SEMI\nC21, SEMI C27, SEMI C28, SEMI C30, SEMI C35, SEMI C38, SEMI C41, SEMI C44, SEMI C54, SEMI C59.\n5. 3  Fabrication Environment \u2014 It is necessary to fabricate MOS capacitors in a clean room environment of 1000 or\nbetter class in total quality.  That is, it needs to be confirmed that the A mode failure rate is 10% or less by TZDB\nevaluation.  The A mode failure depends not only on the particle of work environment atmosphere but also on the\nultrapure  water,  fixtures,  process  apparatus,  clean  clothes,  operation  rules  etc.    Heavily  contamination  such  as\nalkaline or heavy metal has an important negative effect on the GOI of the oxide.\n5. 4  Measurement of Electric Characteristic of MOS Capacitors\n5. 4.1  The  dielectric  breakdown  defect  density  of  the  silicon  oxide  film  is  evaluated  by  constant  current  TDDB\nmeasurement  of  the  MOS  capacitors.    The  evaluation  consists  of  the  measurement  of  charge  injected  before  the\ndielectric breakdown of the MOS capacitors.  To measure the injected charge, voltage applied to a MOS capacitor is\ncontrolled so that the current is kept constant.  The applied voltage is monitored throughout the test, and the time to\nsudden voltage drop which results from dielectric breakdown of the silicon dioxide film is measured.  The amount of\nthe  injected  charge  is  the  product  of  the  measured  time  and  gate  current  density.    The  defect  density  of  the  oxide\nfilm is evaluated from the Weibull plot (cumulative failure rate) of the dielectric breakdown data of approximately\n100 MOS capacitors."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M60-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2005 6\n5. 4.2  Stress Current Density \u2014 For reliable measurement, a voltage/current source with a stable output wave shape\nshall  be  used.    It  is  necessary  to  stabilize  the  output  as  much  as  possible.    In  the  constant  current  TDDB\nmeasurement,  a  constant  current  is  continuously  applied,  and  voltage  is  monitored.    The  dielectric  breakdown  is\njudged  by  a  sudden  drop  in  the  voltage  monitored.    If  the  applied  stress  current  density  is  too  low,  the  time  to\nbreakdown  will  be  too  long  to  be  realistic.    Contrarily,  too  a  high  current  density  is  also  unsuitable  because  the\nvoltage  drop  in  the  oxide  breakdown  instant  becomes  small.    Considering  these  factors,  the  recommended  stress\ncurrent density range is from 0.01 to 0.1A/cm\n2\n.\n5. 5  Measurement  Temperature  \u2014  Besides  current  density,  the  measurement  temperature  is  also  an  important\nparameter  which  determines  measurement  time.    It  is  appropriate  to  measure  in  the  temperature  range  of  room\ntemperature  to  150\xbaC,  taking  into  consideration  the  temperature  tolerance  of  the  measurement  equipment.    In\naddition,  there  are  cases  that  since  silicon  wafer,  stage  chuck,  probe,  and  so  on,  expand  at  a  high  temperature,  the\nprobe deviates from the predetermined position, thus consideration is required when selecting probing machines.\n5. 6  Breakdown Judgment \u2014 To measure the dielectric breakdown lifetime of an oxide film, the voltage applied to a\nMOS capacitor is controlled so that a current is kept constant.  The applied voltage is monitored throughout the test.\nThe dielectric breakdown of the oxide is judged by sudden voltage drop.  In practice, at the dielectric breakdown the\napplied  voltage  becomes  lower  than  the  criterion  voltage  defined  before.    The  dielectric  breakdown  lifetime  is  the\nstress application time till breakdown.  If the criterion voltage is too low, it can easily affected by noise.  In contrast,\nthe  chance  of  missing  breakdown  events  is  increased  if  the  criterion  voltage  is  too  high.    The  changes  in  two\ncontinuous  measured  gate  voltages  can  be  used  to  judge  the  oxide  breakdown.    The  instant  at  which  the  voltage\nchange  became  larger  than  the  criterion  value  is  defined  as  dielectric  breakdown.    The  same  caution  mentioned\nabove  is  also  required  in  this  case.    In  this  round  robin,  the  current  density  is  from  0.01  to  0.1A/cm\n2\n,  the  sheet\nresistance  of  the  poly-silicon  electrode  is  approximately  50  ohm/sq,  gate  electrode  area  is  from  1mm\n2\nto  10mm\n2\n,\ngate  oxide  thickness  is  25nm  and  measurement  temperature  is  from  room  temperature  to  150\xbaC.    In  this  case\ndielectric breakdown is determined from the changes in two continuous measured gate voltages.  For example, the\nchange  in  gate  voltage  is  larger  than  X\ncriterion\n(%)  of  the  former  gate  voltage  value.    X\ncriterion\nis  higher  than  10%.\nAlternatively,  dielectric  breakdown  is  determined  with  the  measured  electric  field,  E\nox\n.    It  is  considered  that\ndielectric breakdown does not happen until E\nox\nbecomes E\ncriterion\nor lower.  E\ncriterion\nis higher than 4MV/cm.  Stable\nmeasurement  results  are  obtained  in  both  cases.    Of  course,  these  criterion  electric  fields  depend  on  gate  oxide\nthickness,  sheet  resistance  and  area  of  gate  electrode,  stress  current,  stress  temperature,  and  so  on.    To  detect  the\ndielectric breakdown with the change in gate voltage as shown in Figure 2, it is desirable to determine the criterion\nunder each condition in advance.\n5. 7  Estimation of Accidental Failure Rate \u2014 As mentioned before, the total number of A-A and A-B mode failures\nis  related  to  the  crystal  quality  of  the  mirror  polished  CZ  Si  wafers.    It  takes  a  long  time  to  measure  the  wearout\nlifetime of all the MOS capacitors.  If a requirement is only measurement of the accidental failure rates of the MOS\ncapacitors  on  silicon  wafer  surface,  TDDB  measurement  can  be  finished  without  detecting  the  wearout  lifetimes.\nThat  is,  maximum  stress  time,  T\nmax\n,  is  determined  to  be  Q\nbd\nin  the  A-B  mode  range  in  advance.    The  cumulative\nfailure rate at T\nmax\nis the total failure rate of the A-A and A-B modes.  If the rough shapes of the Weibull plots of the\nTDDB  measurement  can  be  predicted  in  advance,    T\nmax\nshall  be  determined  as  to  be  the  maximum  Q\nbd\nin  the\nrelatively flat range of the A-B mode.  This reason is that variation of T\nmax\nhas little influence on the evaluation of\ntotal  accidental  failure  rates.    This  method  has  an  advantage  of  that  the  failure  rate  of  the  A-A  and  A-B  modes  is\nevaluated very quickly.\n5. 8  Constant-Voltage TDDB \u2014 The constant-voltage TDDB method is also used for a lifetime test.  Measurement\nconditions shall be optimized for each purpose.  For TDDB, an average electric field of approximately 10MV/cm is\nrequired.  Therefore, the effective electric field applied to an oxide film is influenced by a series resistance.  Thus,\nthe constant current TDDB is more suitable."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M60-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2005 7\nDrop of applied\ngate voltage at\nbreakdown\nBreakdown judgement\nvoltage level\nApplied Gate Voltage (V)\nTime (sec)\nDrop of applied\ngate voltage at\nbreakdown\nBreakdown judgement\nvoltage level\nApplied Gate Voltage (V)\nTime (sec)"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"NOTE:  A typical applied gate voltage as a function of stress time and a relationship between a drop of the applied gate voltage at\ndielectric break-down and breakdown judgment voltage level.\nFigure 2"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"6  Significance and Use\n6. 1  This  standard  gives  the  procedure  for  characterizing  mirror-polished,  p-type  CZ  silicon  wafers  using  the\ndielectric  breakdown  defect  densities  of  the  gate  oxide  thermally  grown  on  them.    The  MOS  capacitors  shall  be\nformed  in  accordance  with  the  fabrication  processes  described  in  \xa75  and  SEMI  M51.    This  reason  is  because  the\noxide  characteristics  depend  on  the  fabrication  processes.    If  MOS  capacitors  would  be  formed  with  different\nfabrication  processes,  it  is  desirable  to  confirm  that  these  GOI  results  are  similar  to  those  of  the  MOS  capacitors\nformed by the fabrication processes described above.  Particularly, the electrode material of the MOS capacitors has\na great influence on the dielectric breakdown of the gate oxide.  Poly-silicon is specified as the electrode material in\nthis standard.  The test with the poly-silicon gate electrode gives us the test results directly applicable to the wafers\nfor the integrated circuits rather than other metal electrodes, because poly-silicon electrodes are commonly used in\nactual devices.  Of course other materials are also available for electrodes.  Where other electrode material is used,\nan  appropriate  method  for  each  case  and  the  correlation  data  between  poly-silicon  and  the  other  material  shall  be\nprepared.\n6. 2  It is well known that both the silicon surface morphology and the cross-sectional structure at the pattern edge of\nthe  active  region  of  the  MOS  devices  influence  the  dielectric  breakdown  of  the  gate  oxide.    Various  types  of\ncontaminants  also  influence  the  dielectric  breakdown  of  the  gate  oxide.    The  extent  of  contamination  by  alkaline\nmetals, heavy metals or organic particles increases, as the sample fabrication process progresses.\n6. 2.1  The electrode area and total number of MOS capacitors shall be chosen to be suitable for the purpose of the\ntest.  The suitable gate area for the constant current TDDB measurement depends on the applied stress (i.e.  induced\ncurrent).  If the gate electrode area is too large, parasitic resistance of the gate electrode disturbs uniform application\nof  stress  current  to  gate  oxide.    That  is,  too  a  high  current  density  leads  to  nonuniform  stress  on  gate  oxide.    As  a\nresult,  the  reliability  of  the  measurement  is  reduced.    The  gate  oxide  with  a  defect  density  is  able  to  be  evaluated\nusing  two  sets  of  MOS  capacitors.    Although  the  gate  area  and  total  number  of  MOS  capacitors  have  the  same\nproduct, one set consists of many capacitors with a small gate area and the other set consists of a few of capacitors\nwith a large gate area.  The TDDB evaluations using the former are more desirable than those using the latter.  In\nthis  round  robin,  where  a  polycrystalline  silicon  thickness  is  300  nm,  sheet  resistance  is  50\u2126/\0  and  gate  area  is\nsmaller than 5 mm\n2\n, reasonable TDDB results were obtained.\n7  Interferences\n7. 1  Since  this  is  a  DC  measurement,  care  must  be  taken  to  make  sure  that  the  silicon  wafer  has  a  low-resistance\nohmic contact.  There must be no dielectric film on the back surface, e.g., silicon oxide, in order to effectively apply\na  voltage  bias  to  the  gate  oxide.    It  is  not  necessary  for  this  to  be  carried  out  with  a  metallic  contact  on  the  back\nsurface  of  the  wafer  under  test.    However,  when  the  vacuum  chucking  is  weak,  care  must  be  taken  because  of  the\npossibility  that  the  dielectric  breakdown  of  the  gate  oxide  is  not  accurately  judged  due  to  an  increase  in  parasitic\nresistance.  It is strongly suggested that testing be carried out with a current polarity such that the silicon surface will\nbe in accumulation below the gate oxide, that is, negative voltages for p-type silicon wafers.  If the polarity of the\nvoltage is chosen to be in the reverse direction, the breakdown voltage may not be accurately measured due to the\npresence of a depletion layer below the gate oxide.  Controls of electrical noise in this test method are crucial to the"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M60-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2005 8\nproper  identification  of  the  failure  criteria.    It  is  possible  that  rapid  voltage  changes  at the dielectric breakdown of\nthe  gate  oxide  cause  electrical  noise.    There  is  a  possibility  that  this  noise  leads  to  misjudgments  of  the  oxide\nbreakdown.    So  it  is  desirable  to  confirm  that  oxide  breakdown  occurred.    For  example  after  the  TDDB\nmeasurement  has  been  completed,  the  samples  are  measured  to  confirm  their  insulation.    Mechanical  stress  due  to\nthe exploring probe can influence the measurement results, because the exploring probe is in contact with the gate\nelectrode  directly  on  the  gate  oxide.    The  actual  results  obtained  depend  somewhat  on  the  sample  fabrication\nprocess.    Care  must  be  taken  to  ensure  consistent  processing.    Wafer  temperature  during  testing  shall  be  clearly\ndefined.  Large temperature variations might have an impact on results.\n7. 1.1  Precaution  \u2014  Since  the  voltages  and  currents  involved  are  potentially  dangerous,  appropriate  means  of\npreventing the operator from coming into contact with the exploring probe or other charge surfaces shall be in place\nbefore testing.  This standard does not include any clauses relating to the safety and sanitation of the environment.\nThose who intend to implement this standard shall consider appropriate means to prevent any accidents or disasters,\nas well as taking responsibility for maintaining a state of safety, health and hygiene for users.\n8  Sampling\n8. 1  Sampling  is  the  responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  test  method.

This failure is caused by\ndefects  generated  during  formation  of  the  gate  oxide  such  as  pinholes  and  also  by  crystal  defects  such  as  COPs.\nThat is, this failure corresponds to the A mode and partial B mode failure of TZDB.\nR1-3.3  A-B Mode \u2014 Intermediate Breakdown Failure\nR1-3.3.1  This  failure  occurs  in  the  intermediate  time  range  from  initial  breakdown  failure  to  wearout  breakdown.\nThis  failure  is  caused  by  extrinsic  defects.    This  failure  corresponds  to  the  B  mode  and  partial  C-mode  failure  of\nTZDB.\nR1-3.4  W Mode \u2014 Wearout Breakdown\nR1-3.4.1  This  breakdown  is  also  called  intrinsic  breakdown  or  wearout  breakdown,  and  related  to  the  intrinsic\nlifetime  of  oxide  films.    The  failure  fraction  steeply  increases  as  shown  in  Figure  R1-2.    The  measurement  of  this\nbreakdown should be performed carefully because the result depends on measurement conditions.\nR1-3.4.2  Classification  of  the  accidental  and  wearout  modes,  that  is,  the  A-B  and  W  modes,  is  far  from  easy\nbecause  the  W  mode  gradually  shifts  toward  the  A-B  mode  as  shown  in  Figures  R1-3,  R1-5  and  R1-6.    It  is\nstatistically  supported  that  the  Weibull  plot  is  straight  in  the  W  mode  region.    The  regression  straight  line  has  the\ncorrelation coefficient higher than 0.9 with the experimental data.  When the A-B mode breakdown events are added\nto  the  breakdown  data,  a  correlation  coefficient  of  the  data  and  its  straight  line  approximation  decreases.    This\ncharacteristic to determine the classification of the accidental and wearout modes can be used.  In this round robin,\nthe  classification  of  the  injected  charge  density,  Q\nw\n,  was  determined  as  follows.    A  regression  straight  line  in  the\ninjected  charge  density  range  of  higher  than  Q\nw\nwas  obtained  by  the  least  square  method.    The  recommended\ncorrelation coefficient is higher than 0.95.  Q\nw\nis 2C/cm\n2\nin Figure R1-4.

The applied voltage was monitored at the constant time interval.  A stress current of 0.001 A/cm\n2\nor less\nleads to uselessly long measurement time.\nR1-4.2  On  the  other  hand,  too  high  a  current  density  leads  to  nonuniform  application  of  the  stress  voltage  to    the\ngate oxide.  That is, the reliability of the measurement is reduced.\nR1-4.3  In this round robin, the applied stress condition is shown in Table R1-1.\nR1-4.4  The Weibull plot obtained in this round robin is shown in Figure R1-5.

The Q\nbd\ndecreased with increasing stress current density, though the difference of the failure rates is\nslight.
