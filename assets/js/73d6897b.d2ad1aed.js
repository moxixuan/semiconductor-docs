The\nfollowing   groups   should   be   considered   during   the\nconfiguration of the equipment.\na) Electrical  Power  Connections  \uf8e7  Includes  but\nis not limited to connections for main electrical\nutility power supply.\nb) Data      Communications      Connections      \uf8e7\nIncludes  but  is  not  limited  to  factory  systems,\nautomated    material    handling    system,    and\nsupport  equipment  communication  cables  and\ninterface connectors.\nc) Gas  Delivery  System  Connections  \uf8e7  Includes\nbut   is   not   limited   to   fittings   for   bulk   and\nspecialty gas lines.\nd) Liquid    Delivery    System    Connections    \uf8e7\nIncludes but is not limited to fittings for liquid\nchemical,   slurry,   ultra   pure   water,   process\ncooling  water,  temperature  control  unit  fluids,\nand industrial water lines.\ne) Equipment  Effluent  Connections  \uf8e7  Includes\nbut  is  not  limited  to  fittings  for  exhaust,  drain,\nand vacuum lines.\nf) Life    and    Safety    System    Connections    \uf8e7\nIncludes  but  is  not  limited  to  fire  protection,\nleak detection, emergency machine off (EMO),\nand hazard warning systems.\n6. 2.2   A  hierarchy  should  be  adhered  to  when  locating\nthese   groups   of   connections   on   equipment.   Data\ncommunication wiring should be routed separately from\npower  wiring  and  connections.  Radio  frequency  (RF)\ninterconnects  should  be  routed  and  grouped  separately.\nAll electrical and electronic wiring should be away from\nand above water and drain lines.\n6. 3  Equipment Point of Connection Consistency\n6. 3.1   This  section  provides  key  elements  to  ensure  the\nrequired   consistency   of   the   equipment   points   of\nconnection.

EPOC tolerances need to be +/- 6.35 mm (+/-\n1/4 inch) in all directions as measured from the supplier\ndefined   equipment   datum   point.   Tighter   tolerances\nshould be considered for inflexible or difficult to move\nhookups such as large diameter (over 2 inch) exhaust or\nwater  lines.  Connector  sizes  and  types  should  match\nexactly.\n6. 3.2   Table  2  -  EPOC  Consistency  Recommendations\nidentify  equipment  variations  and  levels  of  consistency\nrequired  for  equipment  points  of  connection  location,\nconnector type and size.\n6. 3.3   In  Table  2,  the  term  \u201cShould  Match\u201d  identifies\nareas  that  have  traditionally  been  the  most  costly  and\nwhere   significant   gains   can   be   made   in   achieving\ninstallation   efficiency   .   The   term   \u201cCould   Match\u201d\nidentifies  areas  where  modest  gains  can  be  made  in\ninstallation efficiency .\n6. 4  Equipment Point of Connection Reduction\n6. 4.1    The   number   of   connection   points   to   the\nequipment  should  be  kept  to  a  minimum.  The  EPOC\u2019s\nlocated on wafer processing equipment should follow a\nstrategy  commonly  referred  to  as  single  line  drops,\nwhere there is only one point of connection per service\nper  piece  of  equipment.  Where  feasible,  distribution  of\na particular facility (e.g., chilled water, waste drains for\nthe   same   type   of   chemicals)   should   be   distributed\nthrough    internal    manifolding.    Internal    equipment\nmanifolding    should    be    configured    to    allow    for\nconfigurable    equipment    sub-systems    like    process\nchambers and gas panels. In addition to manifolding, all\nother  interface  box  functions  should  be  configured  on-\nboard the equipment this includes any required shut-off\nvalves,   regulators,   filters,   QC   sample   valves   and\npressure indicators.\n6. 5  Equipment Point of Connection Interface Panel\n6. 5.1   Once  EPOC  locations  and  groupings  have  been\ndefined  and  standardized  for  purposes  of  consistency,\nthe supplier could utilize an interface panel concept for\nsimplifying  equipment  hook-up.  The  interface  panel\nshould  consist  of  a  physical  panel  that  becomes  part  of\nthe   permanent   equipment   installation.   All   EPOC\u2019s\nshould  be  comprehended  in  the  layout  of  the  interface\npanel    using    the    recommendations    for    location,\ngrouping,  and  consistency  as  discussed  in  Sections  6.1,\n6. 2,  and  6.3.  The  supplier  should  design  a  standard\ninterface  panel  layout  that  supports  a  given  equipment\ntype and all associated revisions.\n6. 5.2    Common   connector   technologies,   types,   and\nsizes   should   be   utilized   along   with   provisions   for\ncontainment     of     hazardous     materials.     Typically,\nhazardous     production     material     connections     are\ncontained within the equipment\n6. 5.3   Spacing  of  multiple  gas  and  liquid  connections\non  the  interface  panel  should  provide  sufficient  access\nand   spacing   for   installation   and   maintenance   for\nmultiple  lines  (i.e.,  orbital  weld  head,  wrench,  and  test\nfittings).\n7  Pre-facilitation Recommendations\n7. 1   The  pre-facilitation  strategy  should  provide  the\ndevice  manufacturer  with  the  ability  to  efficiently  and\naccurately  install  UPOC\u2019s  prior  to  equipment  delivery,\nallowing  immediate  hook-up  of  the  equipment  upon\narrival   to   the   fab.   The   equipment   supplier   should\nprovide  a  template  and/or  jig,  as  well  as  a  EPOC\ninterface    panel    (if    applicable)    or    pre-facilitation\npedestal  prior  to  the  equipment  delivery  as  part  of  a\nstrategy  to  support  accurate  pre-facilitation  of  utility\npoints  of  connection.  In  situations  where  a  pedestal  is\nbeing  utilized  (see  Section  7.4),  the  pedestal  can  serve\nas  an  aide  to  pre-facilitation.  The  supplier  and  device\nmanufacturer  should  discuss  and  agree  on  the  chosen\nstrategy.\n7. 2     Templates:    The    template    provides    a    two-\ndimensional  guide  that  projects  EPOC  locations  to  a\ntwo-dimensional surface, typically the floor. This would\nallow  the  device  manufacturer  to  open  popouts,  core\nholes, etc., and pre-facilitate to a point close to, but not\nnecessarily  including,  the  UPOC.  See  Figure  1  for  a\nrepresentative example of a Template.\n7. 3   Jigs:  The  jig  provides  a  guide  that  locates  the  -\nEPOC\u2019s  in  three-dimensional  space.  This  would  allow\nthe device manufacturer to pre-facilitate to the UPOC\u2019s\nor  at  least  prefabricate  the  facility  lines  and  UPOC\u2019s\nsuch    that    final    hookup    could    be    accomplished\nimmediately  after  setting  the  equipment.  See  Figure  2\nfor a representative example of a Jig.\n7. 4    Pre-facilitation   Pedestal:   Application   notes   and\nthree   representative   examples   of   using   pedestals   to\nsupport   pre-facilitation   are   included   in   the   related\ninformation section at the end of this document."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E76-0299\uf8e9\n\uf8e9\uf8e9\n\uf8e9 SEMI 1998, 1999\n6\nFigure 1\nTemplate Example\nFigure 2\nJig Example"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E76-0299 \uf8e9\n\uf8e9\uf8e9\n\uf8e9 SEMI 1998, 1999\n7\n8  Documentation Recommendations\n8. 1   Equipment  suppliers  should  provide  the  following\ndocumentation     concerning     equipment     point     of\nconnections  and/or  template,  jig,  and  pre-facilitation\npedestal   to   the   device   manufacturers.

The   amount   of   static   charge,   the\ndistribution of static charge on an object, and the nature\nof  the  static  discharge  will  all  interact  to  determine  if\nthe charge level is safe. It will be difficult to determine\nlevels that guarantee static related problems are totally\neliminated. The goal of this guide is to assist the user in\nidentifying static charge levels likely to cause problems\nin  process  equipment.  This  guide  should  provide  the\nuser  with  enough  insight  to  define  a  test  methodology\nfor each static problem and understand its limitations.\n6. 2  ESD Damage\n6. 2.1      When   considering   direct   ESD   damage   to   an\nobject  (product,  reticle,  or  equipment),  the  important\nparameter   is   the   current   accompanying   the   charge\ntransfer  to  or  from  the  object.  Under  a  fixed  set  of  test\nparameters, the damaging amount of current due to the\ncharge transfer to or from the object can be determined.\nEstablished   test   methods   exist   for   determining   the\nthreshold   of   damage   to   a   particular   object.   ESD\nsimulators  of  various  types  are  used  for  this  purpose.\nRefer   to   EOS/ESD   Association   Standards   listed   in\nSection  4  for  further  information  concerning  device\ntesting.\n6. 2.2  The end user should determine what is damaging\ncurrent   level   due   to   charge   transfer   to   product   or\nreticles  that  will  be  handled  in  a  particular  piece  of\nproduction equipment.\n6. 2.3  In the context of production equipment, it appears\nimportant   to   know   the   charge   on   the   product,   its\ncarriers,   and   any   other   objects   that   might   directly\ncontact  the  product.  Charge  is  measured  in  coulombs,\nor more conveniently in nanocoulombs (10\n-9\ncoulombs)\nfor   this   purpose.   The   measurement   is   made   with\ninstrumentation  known  as  a  Faraday  Cup,  as  shown  in\nSection 7, Figure 1.\n6. 2.4    A  charged  object,  like  an  integrated  circuit,  is\nplaced in the Faraday Cup and a reading is taken of the\ncharge on it. It will be necessary to obtain an instrument\nwith  a  large  enough  \xeccup\xee  for  wafers,  cassettes,  and\nother  equipment  parts.  It  will  also  be  necessary  to  get\nthe  objects  into  the  cup  without  altering  their  charge\nlevels.     Further     information     on     making     these\nmeasurements     should     be     available     from     the\nmanufacturers of the measuring equipment.\n6. 2.5        The    user    should    determine    with    an    ESD\nsimulator  what  levels  of  ESD  cause  product,  or  reticle\ndamage.   The   equipment   manufacturer   will   need   to\ndetermine  with  an  ESD  simulator  what  levels  of  static\ncharge cause equipment damage.\n6. 2.6    It  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  equipment\nmanufacturer  to  demonstrate  that  equipment  operation\ndoes  not  generate  more  than  the  allowable  amount  of\ncharge  on  product,  carriers  or  equipment  parts.  This  is\nshown in Section 7, Figure 2.\n6. 3  Particle Attraction\n6. 3.1    Electrostatic  attraction  (ESA)  of  particles  can\noccur due to the electrostatic field created by the charge\non the surface of an object. Both the field strength and,\nusually  to  a  lesser  degree,  the  divergence  of  the  field\ninfluence   the   electrostatic   contribution   to   particle\ndeposition   velocity.   Electrostatic   particle   deposition\nvelocity   also   depends   on   particle   size   and   particle\nelectrical  charge.  Unfortunately,  even  under  controlled\nlaboratory    conditions,    accurate    measurements    of\nelectric  field  strength,  particle  size  distribution,  and,\nespecially,  particle  charge,  are  difficult.  Of  these  three\nparameters,  electric  field  measurements  are  the  most\nlikely to be available.\n6. 3.2    Measurements  of  electrostatic  field  can  be  made\nwith a commonly available electrostatic fieldmeter. The\nunits  of  electrostatic  field  are  volts/cm  (volts/inch)."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E78-1102 \xa9 SEMI 1998, 2002 4\nPrecise  measurements  will  be  difficult  as  the  presence\nof    the    measuring    instrument    changes    the    field\ncharacteristics  and  may  overstate  the  actual  level  of\nelectrostatic field. This is shown in Section 7, Figure 3.\nSEMI  E43  describes  measurement  techniques  using  an\nelectrostatic fieldmeter.\n6. 3.3  Electrostatic deposition velocity depends only on\nelectric    field,    particle    size    and    particle    charge.\nHowever,  the  concentration  of  particles  deposited  on  a\nsurface also depends on the particle concentration in the\nequipment  area  and  the  length  of  the  exposure  time\nduring  which  particle  deposition  occurs.  Mechanisms\nother than electrostatic deposition, such as gravitational\nsettling  and  diffusion,  can  also  contribute  to  particle\ndeposition.  The  concentration  of  particles  deposited  by\nthese  non-electrostatic  mechanisms  will  also  vary  with\nparticle  concentration  in  the  equipment  ambient  and\nexposure time.\n6. 3.4        Comparisons    of    the    electrostatic    deposition\nvelocity  with  the  deposition  velocities  associated  with\nthese   other   deposition   mechanisms   is   the   key   for\ndetermining  threshold  values  of  allowed  electrostatic\nfield  from  the  viewpoint  of  particle  deposition.  Such\ncomparisons  are  the  basis  for  estimating  the  allowed\nvalues  of  electrostatic  field  presented  in  Appendix  A1-\n2. 2 and Related Information R1-2. Users and equipment\nmanufacturers  should  determine  and  agree  on  ambient\nparticle sizes and concentrations, and product exposure\ntimes.\n6. 4  Equipment ESD\n6. 4.1    Equipment  ESD  immunity  is  being  addressed  in\ngeneral  through  a  number  of  international  standards\nincluding  IEC  61000-4-2  and  BS  EN  61000-6-2  for\nEuropean   CE   compliance.   Measurements   are   made\nusing  an  ESD  simulator  which  is  described  in  these\nstandards.\n6. 4.2  The ESD simulator is used to create both a direct\ndischarge  to  the  surface  of  the  equipment  and  an  air\ndischarge  to  a  surface  10  cm  (4  inches)  away  from  the\nequipment. The ESD simulator charges a 150 picofarad\ncapacitor   (C)   to   a   known   voltage   (V)   and   then\ndischarges   it   to   produce   a   standardized   discharge\nwaveform.   Knowing   the   voltage   and   capacitance\ninvolved  in  this  test  means  the  total  charge  can  be\ncalculated by the equation q = CV. For example, a 4000\nvolt  discharge  (IEC  61000-4-2  test  level)  transfers  a\ncharge, q = 600 nanocoulombs.\n6. 4.3      The   value   of   the   capacitor   (C)   in   the   ESD\nsimulator  is  specified  in  the  international  standards.  It\nshould   not   be   assumed   that   a   different   value   of\ncapacitance  and  voltage  that  produce  the  same  charge\ntransfer  of  600  nanocoulombs  would  have  the  same\naffect  on  a  specific  piece  of  equipment.  Discharge\ncurrents  will  vary  with  the  impedance  of  the  discharge\npath and with the voltage. It is, however, impractical to\ntest  all  possible  combinations.  For  the  purposes  of  this\nguide, the parameters of the ESD simulator specified in\nthe  standards  for  equipment  ESD  immunity  will  be\nused.\n6. 4.4      For   true   ESD   immunity,   an   ESD   event   in\nequipment  must  not  disturb  either  the  equipment  it\noccurs in, or another nearby piece of equipment. Charge\non  product  or  carriers  transferred  from  one  piece  of\nequipment must not disturb the operation of subsequent\nequipment. It will be a systems issue to make sure that\nall  equipment  in  a  facility  meets  the  required  ESD\nimmunity standards.\n6. 4.5    The  range  of  reactions  in  equipment  to  an  ESD\nevent  runs  from  transient  errors  that  are  automatically\ncorrected,   to   hard   errors   that   cannot   be   corrected\nwithout  manual  intervention  or  damage  the  equipment.\nWhile   small   numbers   of   transient   errors   may   be\nacceptable   from   the   point   of   view   of   equipment\noperation,  they  may  still  cause  unacceptable  product\nlosses.\n6. 4.6    The  user  and  manufacturer  must  determine  with\nan ESD simulator what levels of ESD cause equipment\ninterruptions.  The  user  must  determine  if  any  of  these\nequipment interruptions caused by ESD are acceptable.\n6. 4.7      In  setting  a  level  to  provide  ESD  immunity  for\nan  individual  piece  of  equipment  from  static  charge  on\nproducts and carriers, the charge on these items should\nbe  kept  below  the  levels  determined  by  ESD  simulator\ntesting.\n6. 4.8    The  Faraday  Cup  measurement  can  be  used  for\nthis  purpose.  If  equipment  has  been  tested  for  ESD\nimmunity and passes a 4000 volt test, then total charge\non  product  and  carriers  leaving  this  equipment  should\nbe   kept   below   600   nanocoulombs.   Any   product\ntransferred  at  this  level  should  not  be  handled  by  other\nequipment  with  a  lower  ESD  immunity.  A  possible\nimplementation of this test method is shown in Section\n7, Figure 4.\n7  Apparatus\n7. 1  ESD Damage \xf3 The apparatus for determining the\nESD damage thresholds for products will depend on the\ntest   methods   used.
