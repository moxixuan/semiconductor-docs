In spite of this limitation, thetechnique is widely utilized in the industry without thebenefit of standardization of the test conditions.Because of the lack of a precision determination, thistest method should be used for materials specificationand acceptance only after the parties to the test haveestablished reproducibility and correlation.14.2 Bias  No information can be presented on thebias of this test method because no material having anaccepted reference value of carrier recombinationlifetime is available. 15 Keywords15.1 contactless measurement; microwave reflection;photoconductivity decay; recombination lifetime;silicon wafers

It was derived frominformation developed during the original preparation of the standard in ASTM Committee F-1 in 1994.This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures. R1-1 The carrier recombination lifetime is frequentlyassociated with the minority carrier lifetime. Thisassociation is correct only if the lifetime is determinedfor low injection level when (the ratio of density ofexcess photogenerated carriers to the equilibriumdensity of majority carriers) is much less than 1, andthen only if certain other conditions are also met (seeRelated Information 2 and Related Information 3).Nevertheless, the low-injection (small-signal) value ofthe carrier recombination lifetime is independent of theexact value of provided that &lt;&lt; 1. However, in thistest method, it is often neither possible nor convenientto make measurements in the low-injection regime.When this is the case, the measured recombinationlifetime is a function of the injection level.R1-2 The basic model for carrier recombinationthrough defect centers in semiconductors wasdeveloped independently by Hall14 and by Shockleyand Read.15 This model has been thoroughly discussedby Blakemore.16 In the Shockley-Read-Hall (S-R-H)model, it is assumed (1) that the doping level of thesemiconductor is not so high that the semiconductorbecomes degenerate, and (2) that the density of defectcenters is small compared with the majority carrierdensity.NOTE 1: The reader should refer to Blakemores text for amore complete treatment than is presented here, including thederivation of the S-R-H expression (Equation R1-1) forcarrier lifetime and discussion of the effect of Fermi energyon the small-signal recombination lifetime. In addition,Blakemore goes on to discuss other complexities that resultwhen the density of defect centers is not small compared withthe majority carrier density,17 and when carrier trappingoccurs.18 R1-3 Both the assumptions underlying the S-R-Hmodel are generally appropriate for the specimens to bemeasured by this test method. With these assumptions,the density of excess electrons (n e) is equal to thedensity of excess holes (p e), and the electron (n) andhole (p) lifetimes for recombination through a defect 14 Hall, R.

The zero intercept of thisline is0 and its slope is . The linearity of thisfunction provides a test for the validity of the S-R-Hmodel and also for the presence of multiple defectcenters in the test specimen.

This method is particularlyuseful for studying iron in p -type silicon because of thefacts that (1) it is possible to treat the sample to ensurethat essentially all of the iron is in either the elementalor paired state, 19 and (2) the injection level dependence 19 Zoth, G., and Bergholz, W., A Fast, Preparation-Free Method toDetect Iron in Silicon, J.

SEMI MF1535-1104 © SEMI 200413 RELATED INFORMATION 2TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF CARRIER RECOMBINATIONLIFETIME NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI MF1535. It was derived frominformation developed during the original preparation of the standard in ASTM Committee F-1 in 1994.This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures. R2-1 The temperature dependence of the carrierrecombination lifetime as determined under low-injection conditions has been proposed4 as a means foridentifying metallic impurities in silicon. However, thisis possible only for low injection and then only undervery restricted conditions.R2-2 In the low-injection limit, the (S-R-H) carrierrecombination lifetime is given by Equation R1-2. In anondegenerate semiconductor, the carrier densities, n0,p0, n1, and p1, are all exponential functions oftemperature. The equilibrium electron and holedensities, n0 and p0, respectively, are given as follows:  = kTNn cFcexp0 and  = kTNp Fvvexp0 (R2-1) where:Nc = the density of states in the conduction band, instates/cm3,Nv = density of states in the valence band, instates/cm3,F = Fermi energy, or the equilibrium electrochemicalpotential, in eV,c = conduction band edge, in eV,v = valence band edge, in eV,k = Boltzmann's constant ( = 8.6173  105 eV/K),andT = temperature, in K.Similarly, the electron (n1) and hole ( p1) densities whenthe Fermi energy is at the defect center energyT aregiven as follows: = = kTnkTNn FTcTc expexp 01 and  = = kTpkTNp TFTvv expexp 01 (R2-2) R2-3 From Equation R1-2, it is clear that the low-injection (or small-signal) carrier recombinationlifetime,0 , can be calculated readily in terms of the electron and hole capture time constants,n0 andp0 , asthe sum of four terms: 00100000001000000 npnnpnnppnpp ppnn+++++++= (R2-3) In the temperature region between the freeze-out regionand the intrinsic region where the majority carrierdensity is equal to the net dopant density, thedenominator of these terms is constant. If, in addition,the capture time constants are assumed not to dependon temperature, the slope of the ln0 versus 1/T curveyields the defect center energy,T, in those temperatureregions where the defect centers are partially filled (thatis, when a term in p1 or n1 dominates the small-signalrecombination lifetime). Although this assumption isusually not rigorously correct, the variation of capturetime constant with temperature is usually much lessstrong than the exponential dependence of the carrierdensities.R2-4 Three examples, elemental iron in both n- and p-type silicon and iron-boron pairs in p-type silicon, serveto illustrate these considerations. In each case the irondensity is assumed to be 5  10 11atoms/cm3 and thedopant density is assumed to be 1  1015 atoms/cm3, forp-type silicon this dopant density corresponds to aresistivity  1015 Ωcm and for n-type silicon itcorresponds to a resistivity   35 Ωcm. Thetemperature range considered is from 250 to 1000 Kover which the dopant atoms may be assumed to befully ionized. Elemental iron is a donor center which,as shown in Table R1-1, lies well above the valenceband edge in the bottom half of the forbidden energygap. The iron-boron pair is also a donor center but itlies much closer to the top of the valence band.Consequently, in each case p1 &gt;&gt; n1, the differencebeing greater for the iron-boron pair.R2-4.1 Elemental Iron in p-Type Silicon (see FigureR2-1)  Below room temperature, p0 &gt;&gt; p1&gt;&gt; n1 &gt;&gt;n0, so 0 = n0. Between about 150°C and about 200°C,p 1 &gt; p0 &gt; n0 and the term p1 is the largest single term.However, because there is not much difference betweenp1 and p0, the slope of the 0 curve never quite reachesthat of the p1 term, and thus the energy of the elementaliron center cannot be determined accurately from thecurve. At still higher temperatures, n0 becomes

SEMI MF1535-1104 © SEMI 2004 14 comparable with p0 (approaching the intrinsiccondition) and the carrier recombination lifetimedecreases; however, no single term dominates theexpression and so the slopes have no physical meaning. R2-4.2 Elemental Iron in n-Type Silicon (see FigureR2-2)  Below about 100°C, n0 &gt;&gt; p1&gt;&gt; n1 &gt;&gt; p0, so0 =p0 . Between about 200°C and about 225°C, p1 &gt;n0 &gt; p0 and the term p1 is again the largest single term.In this case, there is even less difference between theterms in p1 and p0, so the slope of the0 curve is neverdominated by a single term, and thus the energy of theelemental iron center cannot be determined from thecurve. At still higher temperatures, p0 becomescomparable with n0 (approaching the intrinsiccondition) and the carrier recombination lifetimedecreases; however, as for near-intrinsic p-typematerial, no single term dominates the expression andso the slopes have no physical meaning.R2-4.3 Iron-Boron Pairs in p-Type (Boron-Doped)Silicon (see Figure R2-3)  In this case, p1 &gt;&gt; p0 &gt;&gt;n0 &gt;&gt; n1, so that the term in p1 dominates the low-injection recombination lifetime at all temperaturesfrom well below room temperature to about 225°C.Since p0 = Nboron,0 n0 (p1/Nboron), so that the negativeslope of a plot of ln0 against 1/T yields  =FeB v,the activation energy of the iron-boron pair. At higher temperatures, the material becomes near-intrinsic andthe denominator increases, resulting in a decrease in0.R2-5 These examples illustrate the limited range ofconditions over which the activation energy obtainedfrom measurements of carrier recombination lifetime asa function of temperature slightly above roomtemperature can be associated with the energy level of adefect center located near the middle of the forbiddenenergy gap, as are most of the elemental metallicimpurities.

SEMI MF1535-1104 © SEMI 200415 RELATED INFORMATION 3MINORITY-CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI MF1535. It was derived frominformation developed during the original preparation of the standard in ASTM Committee F-1 in 1994.This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures. R3-1 The recombination of an excess electron-holepair at a defect center is a two-step process. It involveseither (a) the capture of an electron in an empty defectcenter followed by the capture of a hole or (b) thecapture of a hole on a filled defect center followed bythe capture of an electron. Thus, the recombinationtime depends on the number of filled or empty defectcenters as well as the capture time constants.R3-2 The occupancy of the defect centres is controlledby the position of the Fermi energy as discussed byBlakemore. 16 If all of the defect centers are empty, theelectron recombination time is governed by the electroncapture time constant,n0; this occurs when the Fermienergy is well below the defect center energy. If all ofthe defect centers are filled, the hole recombinationtime is governed by the hole capture time constant,p0;this occurs when the Fermi energy is well above thedefect energy. Since the position of the Fermi energy isgoverned primarily by the dopant density, theoccupancy of the defect centers may be different fordifferent resistivity wafers.R3-3 There are two sets of equivalent cases. Thedefect center may be in the same half of the forbiddengap as the Fermi energy or it may be in the other half.Thus, the case for the defect center in the lower half ofthe gap of a p-type semiconductor is the same as for thedefect center in the upper half of the gap in an n-typesemiconductor with the roles of electrons and holesinterchanged. Similarly, the case for the defect centerin the upper half of the gap in a p-type semiconductor isthe same as for the defect center in the lower half of thegap in an n-type semiconductor.R3-4 As examples, consider the three cases ofelemental iron in both n- and p-type silicon and iron-boron pairs in p-type silicon at room temperature (300K). In each case the iron density is assumed to be5  10 11 atoms/cm3. Note that at for very low resistivitywafers, the nondegeneracy requirement of the S-R-Hmodel may be violated.R3-4.1 Elemental Iron in p-Type Silicon (see FigureR3-1)  For all practical values of resistivity, theFermi energy lies many kT below the near mid-gapenergy of the elemental iron center. Consequently, thedefect centers are empty and the limiting process iscapture of excess minority electrons, there being amplenumbers of holes present to recombine with the electron immediately upon its capture by the defect center.Therefore, the small-signal carrier recombinationlifetime is equal to the electron (minority-carrier)capture time constant:0 =n0 .R3-4.2 Elemental Iron in n-type Silicon (see FigureR3-2)  In this case, for all values of resistivity, theFermi energy is very far above the defect center energyand all the defect centers are filled, and hole capture isgoverned by the hole capture time constant,p0 .Because the Fermi energy is close to the conductionband edge, there are large numbers of electrons presentso that as soon as a hole is captured, the defect center isfilled again. Therefore, hole capture is the limitingprocess, and the small-signal carrier recombinationlifetime is equal to the hole (minority-carrier) capturetime constant:0 =p0. R3-4.3 Iron-Boron Pairs in p-Type (Boron-Doped)Silicon (see Figure R3-3)  This defect center islocated quite close to the valence band edge. For all butvery low resistivity wafers, the Fermi energy lies abovethe defect center energy so that some of the defectcenters are filled. In this case, the capture of minorityelectrons is still the limiting process, but since only afraction of the sites can capture an electron, the small-signal recombination lifetime is larger than the electroncapture time constant. Quantitatively, because n0 &lt;&lt; p0,the small-signal carrier recombination lifetime is givenby0 =n0(p1/p0).R3-4.4 The fourth possible case is one in which thedefect center is located near valence band edge in n-type material. The iron-boron pair, of course, cannotexist in n-type material; however, for the case of ahypothetical defect center with energy near the valenceband in n-type material,n0p1 &gt;&gt;p0n0 for all but themost heavily doped material so this term dominates thesmall-signal lifetime and the minority-carrier propertiesdo not influence the recombination process.R3-5 Thus, for deep lying defect centers, the low-injection (small-signal) carrier recombination lifetime isequal to the minority-carrier capture time constant (orminority-carrier lifetime), while for centers close to theband edge, the small-signal carrier recombinationlifetime can be much larger than the minority-carriercapture time constant.

SEMI MF1569-0705 © SEMI 2003, 20051 SEMI MF1569-0705GUIDE FOR GENERATION OF CONSENSUS REFERENCE MATERIALSFOR SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY This guide was technically approved by the global Silicon Wafer Committee. This edition was approved forpublication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on April 7, 2005. It was available atwww.semi.org in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005. Original edition published by ASTMInternational as ASTM F 1569-94. Last previous edition SEMI MF1569-94 (Reapproved 1999). 1 Purpose1.1 This guide covers the procedures for producing a single set of consensus reference materials (ConRefs) in theabsence of suitable certified reference materials from an established source.1.2 Such reference materials are frequently required for calibration of measurement systems to reduce biasdifferences between different organizations.1.3 The generated ConRefs can be used by a single laboratory for internal use or for interlaboratory comparison ofrelated equipment and materials.1.4 Most often, however, they are used for replicating multiple sets of reference materials. In such a case, theproperty values of these reference materials are traceable to the values of the property value of the ConRefs.Depending on the nature of the preparing organization, these multiple sets may be certified reference materials orworking reference materials. For this purpose, a guide for generation of reference materials specific to the materialsand property may be required; Appendix 1 outlines the requirements for preparing a guide for generation of multiplesets of reference materials. 2 Scope2.1 This guide covers the steps to be taken to generate a set of ConRefs for a specific property or family of relatedproperties required in semiconductor technology.2.2 The procedure for generating the set of ConRefs is based on interlaboratory testing in accordance with ASTMPractice E 691. It is assumed for the purposes of this guide that the test method evaluated by the interlaboratorystudy (ILS) is appropriate for determining the property values of the ConRef.2.3 This guide does not cover the selection of one of several possible test methods nor does it cover the case forwhich other reference materials must be used in the measurement of the properties of the ConRef.2.4 This guide also describes procedures that may be used to generate consensus property values that may form thebasis for the generation of multiple sets of CRMs or reference materials (RMs).NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Referenced Standards and Documents3.1 ASTM StandardsE 456  Terminology Relating to Quality and Statistics1 E 691  Practice for Conducting an Interlaboratory Study to Determine the Precision of a Test Method 1 3.2 ISO StandardsISO Guide 30:1981  Terms and Definitions Used in Connection with Reference Materials2 1 Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol 14.02, ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, PA 19428.

SEMI MF1617-0304 © SEMI 2003, 20041 SEMI MF1617-0304TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING SURFACE SODIUM, ALUMINUM,POTASSIUM, AND IRON ON SILICON AND EPI SUBSTRATES BYSECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY This test method was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication bythe North American Regional Standards Committee on December 4, 2003. Initially available atwww.semi.org February 2004; to be published March 2004. Originally published by ASTM International asASTM F 1617-95. Last previous edition SEMI MF1617-98 (Reapproved 2002).1 Purpose1.1 Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) canmeasure on polished silicon wafer product thefollowing:(1) the sodium and potassium areal densities thatcan affect voltage flatband shifts in integrated circuits,and,(2) the aluminum areal density that can affect thethermal oxide growth rate.(3) the iron areal density that can affect gate oxideintegrity, minority carrier lifetime, and current leakage.1.2 The SIMS measurement facilitates the productionof silicon wafers with upper control limits on sodium,potassium, aluminum, and iron areal densities.1.3 This test method can be used for monitoring amirror-polished wafer cleaning process, for researchand development, and for materials acceptancepurposes.1.4 This test method can provide spatial informationfor these metal contaminants, including near-edgesubstrate contamination levels.1.5 This test method is especially useful fordetermining the surface metal areal densities in thenative oxide or chemically grown oxide of polishedsilicon substrates after cleaning. 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers the determination of totalsodium, aluminum, potassium, and iron on the surfaceof mirror-polished single crystal silicon and silicon episubstrates using SIMS. This test method measures thetotal amount of each metal, because this test method isindependent of the metal's chemistry or electricalactivity.2.2 This test method can be used for silicon with alldopant species and dopant concentrations.2.3 This test method is especially designed to be usedfor surface metal contamination that is located withinapproximately 5 nm of the surface of the wafer. 2.4 This test method is useful for sodium, aluminum,potassium, and iron areal densities between 109 and10 14 atoms/cm2 . The limit of detection is determined byeither the BLANK value or by count rate limitations,and may vary with instrumentation.2.5 This test method is complementary to:2.5.1 Total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF), thatcan detect higher atomic number Z, surface metals suchas iron, but does not have useful (&lt;1011 atoms/cm2)detection limits for sodium, potassium, and aluminumon silicon.2.5.2 Vapor phase decomposition (VPD) of surfacemetals followed by atomic absorption spectroscopy(AAS) or inductively coupled plasma massspectrometry (ICP-MS) of the VPD residue, where themetal detection limits are 108 to 10 10 atoms/cm2. Thereis no spatial information available and the VPDpreconcentration of metals is dependent upon thechemistry of each metal.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Surface metal contamination of sodium, aluminum,potassium or iron introduced during handling of the testspecimen or during the measurement itself introduces abias to the measurement. (Particulate roomcontamination containing these metals is easilydistinguished from metal contamination by the shape ofthe SIMS profile that should have the log of the signaldrop linearly with time. A particulate contaminationdoes not follow this shape under SIMS profile.)3.1.1 The discrimination of elemental ions frommolecular ions is particularly important for the 27Al+signal that has a significant interference below about10 11 to 10 12 atoms/cm2 from ubiquitous C2 H 3+molecular ions that may arise from clean room air or

&lt;!-- Page 16 --&gt;

SEMI MF1617-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 2 from plastic cassette containers. The relativeimportance of the organic interference is dependentupon the surface organics of the test wafer.3.1.2 Another significant interference occurs fromubiquitous BO+ when the aluminum is in the range of10 9 to 10 10 atoms/cm2, since surface boron at the 1012atoms/cm2 range is common for all wafers, both n-typeas well as p-type.1 3.1.3 If the surface contains high levels of sodium,there may be a NaO + molecular interference for 39K +.In principle, 11B12C+ and 11 B28Si+ can be a molecularinterferences for 23Na+ and 39K respectively.3.1.4 The 54 Fe+1 signal can have interferences from27 Al2+1 or 54 Cr +1.3.1.5 Discrimination of molecular ion interferences canbe achieved using magnetic mass spectrometersoperated under high mass resolution or in some casesusing quadrupole mass spectrometers via energyfilters.2 3.2 Bias in the relative sensitivity factors (RSFs)derived from reference materials can introduce bias intothe SIMS measured areal densities.3.3 Mass interferences can introduce bias if theinstrument mass resolution, or subsequent detectionscheme, is not sufficient to exclude the interference.3.4 The SIMS sodium, aluminum, potassium, and ironinstrumental backgrounds can limit the detection of lowlevels of surface metals.3.5 The accuracy and precision of the measurement canbe significantly degraded by analysis of specimenswhose surfaces are not all at the same inclination withrespect to the ion collection optics of the SIMSinstrument. The specimen holder must be constructedand maintained such that after specimen(s) are loadedinto the holder, the inclination of the surface of eachspecimen is constant from specimen to specimen.3.6 The accuracy and precision of the measurementsignificantly degrade as the roughness of the specimensurface increases. This degradation can be avoided byusing chem-mechanical polished surfaces.3.7 If an oxygen leak is not used in conjunction withthe measurement, there may be a bias due to the effect 1 Mollenkopf, H., Chemicals and Cleanroom Filtered Air Effects onBoron Contamination and Its Near Surface Detection in SiliconWafers, Extended Abstracts, Vol 93-2, Abstract No. 170, TheElectrochemical Society, Pennington, NJ, 1993, pp. 273274.2 Frost, M.

The holder istransferred into the analysis chamber of the SIMSinstrument.6.2 A primary ion beam, typically O2+, is used tobombard each specimen with a sputter rate less than0.015 nm/s (0.9 nm/min).6.3 The area of analysis may be different for differentinstruments and may range from 100 m  100 m to 1mm  1 mm.6.4 Depending upon instrumentation, a molecularoxygen jet or leak may be focused on the analysis area.6.5 The positive secondary ions 23Na, 27Al, 39K, and54Fe are mass analyzed by a mass spectrometer, anddetected by an electron multiplier (EM) or equivalenthigh-sensitivity ion detector as a function of time untilthe signals reach background levels or 1% of the initialsignal rates of each element. The instrumentation mustbe able to discriminate the elemental ion signals frommolecular interferences.6.6 A BLANK silicon sample is used to evaluatewhether the lower limit of detection arises frommolecular ion interferences, elemental instrumentalbackgrounds, or count rate limitations. The matrixpositive secondary ion count rate for silicon ( 28Si, 29Si,or 30Si) is measured by a faraday cup (FC) orappropriate detector during, or at the end of, the profile.If multiple detectors are used during the test, therelative sensitivities of the detectors are determined bymeasuring standard ion signals (either the same positive 3 Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol 14.02, ASTM International,100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, PA 19428.

An molecularoxygen jet may be used to stabilize the surface ionyield; the local oxygen gas flux to the specimen surfacemust be stable enough that the secondary ion yield doesnot vary during the analysis. The stability of theoxygen jet effect can be checked by monitoring asilicon matrix signal during a profile; and if the matrixsignal is not monitored during a profile, the vacuumchamber pressure can be monitored for fluctuations inthe oxygen gas pressure. The SIMS instrument shouldbe adequately prepared and maintained so as to providethe lowest possible instrumental backgrounds.7.2 Test Specimen Holder  Reserved for the SIMSmeasurement. In some instruments the holder cansupport multiple 5 by 5-mm samples that are held facedown against metal (tantalum) windows. In otherinstruments the holder can support one or more 15 by15-mm samples by spring clips on the edge of thespecimen or silver paste on the sample back surface.Some instruments can hold full silicon wafers. In allcases, the sample holder should be adequately preparedand maintained so as to provide the lowest possiblecontribution to instrumental backgrounds.7.3 Stylus Profilometer  Or equivalent device (forexample, atomic force microscope) to measure SIMScrater depths. This is required to calibrate depth scalesfor concentration profiles of calibration standardsamples. For routine depth scale calibration of testspecimens, the instrument must be capable of craterdepth measurements of 10 nm with an accuracy andprecision of 10%. In the absence of such an instrument,a secondary depth calibration standard (such as a siliconwafer with a known impurity depth profile) must beprepared and can be used to measure the SIMS sputterrate during the measurement.NOTE 1: The accurate measurement of sputter crater depthson the order of and below 10 nm is still an area of research,because the sputtered silicon is very reactive to oxygen in the air when removed from the SIMS chamber for crater depthmeasurement. For example, sputter craters expected to beonly 1 nm in depth can actually be thicker than the originalnative oxide due to this rapid oxide growth on sputteredsilicon, that is, one observes a bump on the surface where theerosion was, rather than a crater. If a reference sample issimilar to the unknown in type, that is, intentional surfacecontamination rather than shallow ion implant, it may bepossible to avoid the need for a direct shallow crater depthmeasurement on each sample. 8 Sampling8.1 Since this procedure is destructive in nature, asampling procedure must be used to evaluate thecharacteristics of a group of silicon wafers. No generalsampling procedure is included as part of this testmethod, because the most suitable sampling plan willvary considerably depending upon individualconditions. For referee purposes, a sampling plan shallbe agreed upon before conducting the test. See ASTMPractice E 122 for suggested choices of sampling plans. 9 Specimen Requirements9.1 Sample specimen surfaces must be flat and smooth(see Sections 3.5 and 3.6).9.2 Sample specimens must be cleaved or diced to fitwithin the sample specimen holder. Specimens neednot be all the same size, but typical specimen sizes areapproximately square with one side of dimension 5 to15 mm.9.3 Prepare a BLANK specimen with a level of surfacemetal below that expected to be detected by this testmethod, and which has surface organics of a level andtype expected for the unknown specimens.NOTE 2: If measurements are to be made on specimenstaken soon after a cleaning process, the organics on thesurface from clean room air and cassette carriers are very lowand negligible. However, if the specimens are stored for oneday or more, the level of organics may be significant for amolecular ion interference in the measurement5; thisinterference must be removed by the detection scheme. 10 Calibration10.1 The calibration is by RSFs which are determinedempirically from reference materials.10.1.1 Reference materials may be either:10.1.1.1 Spin Coat Contaminated Samples Calibrated by Vapor Phase Decomposition/Atomic 5 Muller, A.

With a spin coatcontaminated reference sample, it may be possible toavoid the need for the crater depth measurement and itsbias/variability.

With an SC-1 dippedreference sample, it may be possible to avoid the needfor the crater depth measurement and itsbias/variability. For this reference sample the arealdensity D to be used in Equation 1 (see Section 12.1) isthe elemental areal density determined by theVPD/AAS or VPD/ICP-MS, corrected for isotopicabundance since the SIMS measurement of Sii isisotopic.10.1.1.3 Ion Implants  Such as 23Na, 27Al, 39K, and56 Fe, (or 54 Fe) implanted into silicon and shown byqualitative SIMS, or by TXRF for iron to be spatiallyuniform, since spatial non-uniformity can introducevariability or bias to the SIMS quantitativemeasurement. It is necessary to demonstrate that RSFsobtained from these reference materials and theinstrumentation and operation used for themeasurement are consistent with RSFs from spin coatedreference samples.5 For this reference sample, the arealdensity D to be used in Equation 1 (see Section 12.1) isthe implanted isotopic dose. 11 Procedure11.1 Specimen Loading and SIMS Instrument Set-up11.1.1 Cleave or dice individual specimens (unknowns,reference, BLANK) to fit within the sample holder.The reference sample must contain 23Na, 27Al, 39K, and56 Fe (or 54 Fe) or there must be multiple referencesamples, each with one or more of these elements. Dothis preparation in such a way as to minimizecontamination of the specimens with surface metals.11.1.2 Load the specimen(s) into the SIMS sampleholder. 11.1.3 Transfer the loaded holder into the SIMSinstrument sample chamber.11.1.4 Turn on the instrument in accordance with themanufacturer's instructions.11.1.5 Set the appropriate analytical conditionsincluding the method for molecular ion massinterference discrimination.11.1.5.1 Select a primary ion current, primary beamraster size, and secondary spectrometer transmission,which will result in an appropriate sputter rate (lessthan 0.015 nm/s).11.1.5.2 Select the secondary spectrometer conditionsso that the maximum secondary ion-count rates result indead time losses below 10%. 6 11.1.6 Confirm that analytical conditions areappropriate to the measurement goals by measurementof known reference standard(s) and BLANK sample.11.1.6.1 Confirm that the analytical sputter rate is suchthat each element monitored in a single profile issampled at a frequency greater than or equal to onceevery 0.2 nm of sputtered depth.11.1.6.2 If an oxygen jet is used, confirm that 0-leakpressure is suitable by measuring a matrix ion depthprofile and demonstrating that matrix secondary ionyield is constant (within 20%) during the analysis of thefirst 10 nm of a specimen. Perform this confirmationmeasurement on a typical specimen at the same sputterrate to be used for the measurement of the surface metalimpurities. If the ion yield shows significant variation,increase the 0-leak pressure by a factor of 2 andreconfirm stability.11.1.6.3 Depending upon the instrumentation used andif needed, measure the detector efficiency ratio(s) forany detectors used during the measurement (forexample, the electron multiplier and the faraday cupdetectors). Make this measurement by intercomparingstandard secondary ion signals of the appropriateintensity (to minimize dead-time losses). Thesecondary ion count rates used here may be differentfor this measurement than for the analysis, and may begenerated under different sputter rate conditions thanthe analysis.11.2 Analysis of Specimen11.2.1 Center the primary ion beam, initialize theSIMS instrument control software, and begin a SIMSprofile.

If this general profile shapeis not obtained, repeat the measurement on a freshsurface of the specimen.11.2.2 When the impurity signal has either: (1)decreased to at least &lt;1% of the maximum, (2) orreached a constant background count rate, then measureand record the silicon matrix ion count rate on theappropriate detector.11.2.3 Measure the sputter rate under the analysisconditions. This can be done by measuring the SIMScrater depth with a stylus profilometer or equivalentinstrument if available, and combining the depthmeasurement with the recorded time elapsed during thesputter profile. If the analytical craters are too shallowto be measured by available instrumentation, the sputterrate must be monitored during a measurement series byrepeated analysis of a previously characterized standardsample.11.2.4 Measure the BLANK under the same analyticalconditions as the unknown specimens. 12 Calculations12.1 The RSF for an element in a matrix can bedetermined experimentally from the SIMS profile of areference material containing a known areal density ofthe impurity of interest as follows: ( )NISIdtDNIbim=RSF (1) where:D = the areal density of the impurity inatoms/cm2,N = the number of data cycles in the profile,I m = the matrix isotope secondary ion intensity,(counts/s),d = the sputtered depth, cm,SI i = the sum of the impurity isotope secondaryion-counts over the depth of the profile,I b = a constant background intensity of theimpurity isotope, andt = the analysis time for the species of interest,s/cycle.12.2 The calibration of concentration in a SIMS profileis calculated as follows: = EMFCIICmii RSF (2) where:Ci = the impurity atomic concentration,atoms/cm3,I i = the isotope secondary in intensity, counts/s,I m = the matrix isotope secondary ion-intensity,counts/s,RSF = relative sensitivity factor, atoms/cm3 , andFCEM= the ratio of matrix intensities on the faradaycup (FC) to the electron multiplier (EM),when two detectors are used.12.3 The conversion of data cycles or time into depth iscompleted by measuring the crater depth and the totaltime (or data cycles) of the sputtering that formed thecrater. The depth scale is assumed to be linear withtime or data cycles.12.4 Calculate the RSFs and impurity concentrationversus depth from Equations 1 and 2.12.5 Calculate the surface areal density by integratingthe concentration versus depth profile after anysubtraction of a constant background count rate thatmay be appropriate. 13 Report13.1 Report the following information:13.1.1 The instrument used, the operator, and the dateof the measurements,13.1.2 Identification of test, BLANK, and referencespecimens,13.1.3 Calibration procedure used,13.1.4 Method used to discriminate molecular ioninterferences,13.1.5 Surface areal density of the impurity, and13.1.6 Surface areal density of the impurity for theBLANK specimen. 14 Precision and Bias7 14.1 Precision  Tables 1, 2, and 3 summarize thestatistics from a spoke-wheel round robin including 4test samples and 10 laboratories.

The variation of film propertiesacross the surface of a wafer can have significantimpact on the further processing of the wafer and on theultimate yield of acceptable chips from the wafer, aswell as on their reliability.1.2 The purpose of this practice is to promotecommonality of approach to the analysis of uniformityamong all parties needing to generate or assess suchinformation, including manufacturers of the basic testinstrumentation to be used.1.3 This practice is intended for process control,research and development, and process equipmentevaluation purposes. It is intended for the benefit ofsemiconductor device and equipment manufacturersalike so that acquisition, reduction, and communicationof thin film data is consistent among various partieswho may need to concur on interpretation of the resultsof a thin film fabrication-process step.1.4 Measurement of the uniformity of one or more thinfilm properties such as thickness, sheet resistance,reflectivity, dielectric constant or index of refractionenables the monitoring of a critical aspect of the resultsof a given process step. This information can be usedto determine the behavior of individual process steps; itcan be used with similar information from earlierprocess steps to determine their interaction with respectto final product uniformity. Also, it can be used inconjunction with historical data from the same processstep to determine loss of control of the piece ofequipment or the process cycle being used with respectto producing product having a required level ofuniformity. Further, it can be used to determine theadequacy of new or modified process cycles, materialsor equipment for a given film deposition or filmmodification requirement.1.4.1 It is common practice to monitor the value of asimple statistic, such as the standard deviation, thatresults from layer uniformity measurement data and tocompare the current value of the statistic with historicalvalues for the same layer formation process. An increase of the current value over historical values istaken as an indication of possible deterioration of thequality of the layer formation process. It is thencommon to convert the data into a contour or similarmap of uniformity to aid in diagnosing changes in theprocess that caused the increase in standard deviation(or similar statistic). This practice does not treat theinterpretation of the statistic resulting from dataanalysis, nor does it give procedures for converting thedata to a uniformity map.1.5 The non-uniformities of a film property on a givenwafer are primarily systematic, not random, in theirspatial shape or distribution and arise from spatiallysystematic variations in such process variables astemperature, gas flow, pressure, or electric field. As aresult, the simple statistic standard deviation that isspecified for analysis of data acquired with this practicewill not generally have the normal interpretation for thestandard deviation of a sample from a randompopulation. It is a figure of merit for comparing datasets of a similar type, but it cannot be used forcomputing confidence or tolerance intervals. 2 Scope2.1 This practice covers a set of site distributionpatterns for measuring the uniformity of a property of athin film on a silicon wafer, as well as simpleprocedures for analyzing and reporting the results ofthose measurements.2.2 This practice is intended for use as a template forthe evaluation of the uniformity of intrinsic filmproperties such as thickness or composition, and alsofilm functional characteristics such as sheet resistanceand reflectivity. The resulting information may be usedto assess the uniformity of the film itself or of the layerformation process. This practice is not directlyapplicable to evaluating wafer-to-wafer or lot-to-lotvariations.2.3 This practice is intended for use with any thin filmor layer type, or formation technique, for which basicmeasurement instrumentation and capability exists that,is appropriate to the film parameter of interest. Thispractice is intended for layer growth and depositiontechniques such as epitaxy, implantation, thermal and

This practicedescribes measurement site patterns and determinationof their spatial coordinates on the wafer, as well as thestatistics to be used when reducing the measurementdata to determine uniformity. For each of the samplingplans, the exact number of measurement sites is chosenbased on the size of the wafer being used, the desiredspatial resolution of the measurement instrument, andwhether maximal, or somewhat lesser informationdensity is desired. However, in all such choices, thepattern of measurement sites, the rules for selectingtheir coordinates on the wafer, and the statisticalcalculations of the results should remain consistent withthe procedures of this practice.2.5 This practice can be used with any measurementmethod, procedure or instrumentation that can measurethe needed film property or characteristic withsufficient precision and spatial resolution to reveal theneeded information on spatial non-uniformity of thefilm. This practice does not itself contain details onperforming any specific measurement.2.5.1 Not all types of measurements that may need tobe used for evaluation of the uniformity of a thin filmhave formal procedural standards. SEMI MF374,SEMI MF576, SEMI MF1392, SEMI MF1393, andSEMI MF1529 give details of measurement proceduresthat may be applied to evaluating the uniformity of thinfilm properties.2.5.2 This practice does not deal with acquisition oranalysis of uniformity data where it is desired to takemore than one measurement per specified spatial cellsuch as is commonly done for wafer site flatnessmeasurements.2.6 This practice makes no recommendations regardingthe interpretation of the statistics that result fromanalysis of the data acquired with regard to thegoodness or badness of given values of the test statistic,nor does it make recommendations regarding decisionsabout the process cycle or equipment used to producethe thin film that was measured.2.7 The principles of this practice may be adapted todetermine the uniformity of bulk silicon waferproperties such as interstitial oxygen content andresistivity, but depending on the desired property andthe chosen measurement technique, depth-dependentvariations may be misinterpreted as lateral variations. NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This practice is written for evaluation of planar orblanket films, but it may be applied to patterned films ifthe pattern size, shape, and distribution do not interferewith the spatial resolution of the selected measurementtechnique and the specified measurement site selection.If either of these interferences occur, the user may adaptthe principles of the method to the needed application,but the interpretation of the results may change.3.2 The principles of this practice may be adapted toother semiconductor wafers, such as gallium arsenide,but particular concerns with those other materials maynot be addressed adequately in this practice.3.3 Uniformity measurements from certain types ofmeasurements may be misinterpreted if the user is notaware of the full nature of the basic measurement beingmade. For example, sheet resistance is a function bothof the inherent resistivity of the film being measuredand of its thickness value. Non-uniformity in sheetresistance values across the wafer may result from non-uniformity in resistivity (layer composition or structure)or layer thickness (deposition rate) alone, or it mayresult from simultaneous variations of both parameters.3.4 Changes in test equipment performance, or changesin test procedure or conditions over time maydetrimentally affect the ability to compare test resultsfrom this practice over time for a given film property orfabrication step. It is the responsibility of the user toensure that the measurement system and processremains in sufficient control to allow time-wisecomparison of uniformity results, if such comparisonsare needed.3.5 Sampling area or sampling spot-size may causemisinterpretation of the cause of thin film non-uniformity if the magnitude of the non-uniformity andits spatial scale, or rate of variation is not well matchedto the sampling spot size and the selected distribution ofmeasurement sites. While this should not be a seriousconcern for most modern film deposition processes, andprocess equipments, which are operating in control, theprinciples of this limitation are worth elaborating.3.5.1 If the sampling area or the spot size of the testinstrument is large compared to rates of film parameterchange (gradients) that are important to identify, it mustbe recognized that such large sampling area instrumentsgenerate some form of spatial average response that

&lt;!-- Page 23 --&gt;

SEMI MF1618-1104 © SEMI 20043 may understate macroscopic film non-uniformity or failto respond to microscopic film non-uniformities orboth.3.5.2 If the sampling area or spot size is small, it isgenerally possible to quantify the full scale ofmacroscopic film non-uniformities. However, shouldspatial fine-scale systematic film variations be present,they may affect the individual measurements in aninconsistent manner unless the measurement samplingplan is tailored to the spatial size scale of the finevariations. Such tailoring of the sampling plan isgenerally incompatible with the requirements of thispractice.3.6 For the most meaningful interpretation ofuniformity data, all sampling sites should representequal wafer areas, and the available area of the wafershould be fully sampled. The existence of wafer flatscauses a failure of the first requirement with allconcentric circle sampling plans. The need of thesemiconductor industry to establish as large a qualityarea as possible on wafers also causes a failure of thefirst requirement for the outermost circle of concentriccircle sampling plans because of the need to measureright up to a very small edge exclusion value. Thesecond requirement is not met near the perimeter ofCartesian sampling plans.3.7 Ideally, measurements would be made at thespecified sites in a random sequence so that instrumentdrift or changes in other environmental parameters thatmay affect measurement results would have a randomcorrelation with measurement positions. It is normallynot practical to acquire data in this fashion. Therefore,any instrumental or environmental change that mayoccur will have a correlation with the spatial orderingof the measurement sequence. While such changes areexpected to have about the same effect on bothconcentric circle and Cartesian sampling planmeasurements, providing the number of data points areabout the same, they would nevertheless have differenteffects on two-dimensional contour maps that resultedfrom these two different types of sampling plans.3.8 Individual test instruments and test methods thatmay be used to measure properties or characteristics ofthin films are subject to various interferences that mayaffect measurement precision consistency, resolution,and accuracy. These may include such things assensitivity to stray illumination, rf-fields, and variationsin temperature. It is the responsibility of the user of thispractice to consult instrument manuals and appropriatetest methods in order to identify and control potentialinterferences with that instrument or method.3.8.1 It is also the responsibility of the user to devise atest for the inherent precision of the measurement being made so that imprecision in the measurement is notmisinterpreted as non-uniformity of the thin film beingevaluated by this practice. This is particularlyimportant for application of this practice to evaluatingfilms from process steps that are capable of a very highdegree of uniformity, for example, 1% across a wafer.Such tests may involve using known uniform or non-uniform test specimens whose spatial pattern of non-uniformity has been found to be very stable overextended periods of time. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specifications for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI M20  Practice for Establishing a WaferCoordinate SystemSEMI MF81  Test Method for Measuring RadialResistivity Variation on Silicon WafersSEMI MF374  Test Method for Sheet Resistance ofSilicon Epitaxial, Diffused, Polysilicon, and Ion-Implanted Layers Using an In-Line Four-Point Probewith the Single-Configuration ProcedureSEMI MF576  Test Method for Measurement ofInsulator Thickness and Refractive Index on SiliconSubstrates by EllipsometrySEMI MF673  Test Methods for MeasuringResistivity of Semiconductor Slices or Sheet Resistanceof Semiconductor Films with a Non-contact Eddy-Current GageSEMI MF1241  Terminology of Silicon TechnologySEMI MF1392  Test Method for Determining NetCarrier Density Profiles in Silicon Wafers byCapacitance-Voltage Measurements with a MercuryProbeSEMI MF1393  Test Method for Determining NetCarrier Density in Silicon Wafers by Miller FeedbackProfiler Measurements with a Mercury ProbeSEMI MF1529  Test Method for Sheet ResistanceUniformity Evaluation by In-line Four-point Probe withthe Dual-configuration ProcedureNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions of terms used in this practice may befound in SEMI M1 and SEMI MF1241.

SEMI MF1618-1104 © SEMI 2004 4 6 Summary of Practice6.1 Measurements are made at the sites specified in thechosen sampling plan using the appropriateinstrumentation and measurement procedure for thefilm parameter of interest. Measures of the dispersionof the values are obtained by simple statistics specifiedfor the sampling plans. 7 Apparatus7.1 Four-probe Sheet Resistance, Eddy-current,Mercury Probe CV, Spectroscopic Reflectometers,Ellipsometers, Interferometers, and StylusProfilometers  Typical apparatus chosen according tothe type of material parameter being monitored. Othersmay be chosen according to need. The instrumentationshould include such features as temperature monitoringand control, EMI shielding, shielding fromillumination, etc. as is necessary for good practice ofthat type of measurement. In addition, allinstrumentation must include the following:7.1.1 Ability to center the wafer on the measurementstage to an accuracy of 0.5 mm or better,7.1.2 Vacuum chuck, or similar fixture, to secure thewafer to the instrument stage during measurement,7.1.3 Ability to locate the measurement pointsspecified in the chosen sampling plan to an accuracy of0.5 mm or better, and7.1.4 Ability to store all measurement data to performthe required calculation of uniformity.7.2 Capability of the instrumentation to perform one ormore of the following auxiliary data presentations ishighly recommended:7.2.1 Generating a two-dimensional contour map of theacquired data,7.2.2 Generating a histogram of the raw data values,and7.2.3 Presenting the raw data as a time-series plot.7.3 Capability to edit data and to blend or interpolatedata in conjunction with two-dimensional mapping maybe useful, but it should be done with caution. 8 Procedure8.1 Calibrate the measurement system in accordancewith the manufacturers instructions or with theapplicable test method.8.2 Place the wafer on the instrument stage so as tolocate the wafer center within 0.5 mm of the center ofthe stage. For the purposes of this procedure, the wafercenter is considered to be defined by the intersection of any two diameters that do not intersect a wafer flat ororientation notch.8.3 Select the sampling plan to be used from thoselisted in Appendix 1 and proceed to take measurementsat all the specified locations. It may be necessary toenter the coordinates of the desired sampling plan intoinstrument software, or to work with the manufacturerof the equipment to modify its software if the samplingplans available in the instrument do not match therequirements of Appendix 1.8.4 Take measurements at all locations specified forthe selected sampling plan. Then quantify theuniformity from the acquired data using the calculationsspecified in Section 9. 9 Calculations9.1 Calculate the mean, x , and the standard deviation,s, of the N measurement values, xi , as follows: == Ni ixNx 11 , and (1) 2/1 12)(11  = =Ni i xxNs (2) 9.2 Examine the data. If agreed upon between partiesto the test, reject values that are away from the mean bymore than three times the standard deviation calculatedin Section 9.1. Recalculate the mean and standarddeviation using Equations 1 and 2, where N is now thereduced number of data points.NOTE 1: It is generally advisable, through use of a timeseries plot of the original data, or similar means, to inspect thedata just rejected for determination of measurement sitelocation and relation to adjacent measurement values.NOTE 2: The calculation for standard deviation may bemade regardless of any systematic behavior of the underlyingdistribution of measured values. However, when there is asystematic spatial behavior to the measured values, thestandard deviation may not be used to estimate confidenceintervals or tolerance limits. 9.3 Calculate the following two statistics from thecomplete data set or from the reduced data set if certainmeasurements were rejected in Section 9.2. These twostatistics represent the range and the distribution of dataabout the mean. The use of only one of these statisticsis at the discretion of the interested parties.9.3.1 High-Low Variation, HLV, in percent: 200(%)minmaxminmax += xxxxHLV (3)

SEMI MF1618-1104 © SEMI 2004 6 APPENDIX 1SAMPLING PLANS TO BE USED FOR WAFER UNIFORMITYDETERMINATIONNOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI MF1618 and was approved by full letter ballotprocedures. A1-1 IntroductionA1-1.1 For all plans, measurements are made within acircular area defined by the radius, Ro, between thecenter of the wafer and the circle on which the centersof the outermost measurement sites lie. Determine thisradius by either of the following methods:A1-1.1.1 Method A  In this method, the outermostedges of the measurement spots on the outermost radiusare tangent to the boundary of the fixed quality area(FQA) as defined in SEMI M1:  += )2(2dEEDRo (A1-1) where:Ro = radius of the outermost measurement circle (seeFigure A1-1),D = nominal diameter of the wafer, for example,100, 150, 200, or 300 mm,EE = nominal wafer edge exclusion, whichdetermines the FQA, andd = known or estimated diameter of themeasurement spot for the test instrument beingused (Note 1).NOTE 1: The exact diameter of the measurement spot maynot be known for many types of measurements. Estimate thediameter as 1.5 times the probe spacing for a four-point probe,transducer radius for an eddy-current instrument, and apparentbeam spot radius for optical measurements if no otherinformation is available. A1-1.1.2 Method B  In this method, the centers of themeasurement spots on the outermost radius are on theboundary of the fixed quality area (FQA) as defined inSEMI M1: EEDRo = 2 (A1-2) where the symbols are defined following Equation A1-1.A1-2 Selection of MethodA1-2.1 Neither of these methods is better than theother; rather, there are tradeoffs. A1-2.2 The location of every point in a multipointmeasurement pattern depends on the method chosen todefine the position of the outermost measurement sites.Therefore, there may be differences between the twomethods for reported individual and statistical values.A1-2.3 Data for a measurement site are usually reportedat the location corresponding with the center of themeasurement spot.A1-2.4 Data from each measurement on the outermostring in Method A are not affected by the film propertiesin the edge exclusion annulus outside the FQA.However, in this case, data are not reported forlocations closer to the boundary of the FQA than themeasurement spot radius.A1-2.5 Conversely, data from each measurement on theoutermost ring with Method B include contributionsfrom film properties both inside and outside the FQA.In this case, measurement data is reported for locationsup to the boundary of the FQA, but establishing thesignificance of including data influenced by filmproperties outside the FQA is outside the scope of thispractice.NOTE 2: Measurements obtained using a probe whoseeffective measurement area extends beyond the edge of thefilm inaccurately represent actual film properties.

SEMI MF1618-1104 © SEMI 20047 A1-3 Concentric Circle Plans2 A1-3.1 The concentric circle plans are designed so thateach measurement location samples approximately anequal area of the specimen surface. Because these arecircular plans on a circular wafer, ideally they giveequal representation to all portions of the waferssurface. This approximation to equal-area samplingbreaks down for the outermost circle if the size of theedge exclusion is less then half the radial separationbetween the inner circles for the spacing being used. Inthis case, the measurements on the outer circlerepresent a smaller area of silicon than do themeasurements on the inner circles. Moreover, if theactual sampling area of the measurement being used islarger than the value estimated in Section A1-1.1.1,measurements on the outer circle may be partiallyinfluenced by thin film properties in the excludedregion even though the resulting values are attributed tothe fixed quality area of the film.A1-3.2 The concentric circle sampling plans utilize ameasurement at the wafer center and points on anumber of concentric circles designated 1, 2, 3, ... n, thenumber of circles being chosen by the user according towafer diameter, estimated sampling area for themeasurement being made, and the amount ofinformation desired about the uniformity of the thinfilm.A1-3.2.1 On each circle, the measurements areseparated by equal angular intervals. Eightmeasurements are made on the first circle, 16 are madeon the second circle, etc. In general, the number ofmeasurements is eight times the circle number. For thefirst circle, measurements are separated by rotations of45°, for the second circle, by 22.5°, and so forth,regardless of the radial value of the measurement or thewafer diameter.A1-3.2.2 The radial values for the concentric circles aredetermined as follows. Inspect Table A1-1 for thenumber of total measurements that are made as afunction of the number of circles used and decide on thenumber of circles according to the amount ofinformation needed for the film uniformity and the timerequired for the test instrument to take that manymeasurements. Call the chosen number of circles, NC.Divide the value of the outermost radius, Ro,determined in Section A1-1.1, by NC. This gives theradial increment between the circles. The center of themeasurement tool or measurement spot is to be placedat the location given by this radial increment value. 2 Keenan, W. A., Johnson, W. M., and Smith, A.

Langer (ASTM International, WestConshohocken, PA, 1986) pp. 598614. Figure A1-2 illustrates measurement locations for three-circle and four-circle sampling plans.NOTE 3: If the incursion of the orientation flat(s) precludestaking valid measurements near the flat in conjunction withthe chosen edge exclusion, the parties to the test may chooseto exclude specified measurement locations if the testinstrument permits or to replace specified sites with sites at adistance from the flat that is equal to the distance specifiedwith respect to the circular perimeter of the wafer. It must beremembered, however, that either such choice may have anadverse impact on the interpretation of any two-dimensionalcontour map.Table A1-1 Number of Measurement Sites forVarious Numbers of Concentric CirclesNumber ofcircles3 4 5 6 7 8 Number ofsites49 81 121 169 225 289 A1-3.2.3 For consistency, place the wafer on theinstrument stage with the primary flat, or notch, facingthe operator. If another convention becomes necessary,so note it on the report. Measurements are madestarting at the center of the wafer then proceedingaround the first, then the second, then the third circle,and so forth. For all circles, make sure that the firstmeasurement is made at the same angular orientation;the positive x-axis or the positive y-axis, as defined inthe wafer coordinate system specified in SEMI M20, isrecommended. The choice should have no bearing onthe data or its analysis. However, if data is to bepresented as a time-series plot, note on the plot theposition of the first point on each circle as well aswhether the measurements proceed in a clockwise orcounterclockwise fashion on the wafer surface.A1-3.3 Calculate the uniformity based on the differencebetween the maximum and minimum measured values,HLV(%), and on the standard deviation as a percent ofthe mean of all measurements, SUP(%) as detailed inSection 9.3. A1-4 Cartesian Sampling PlansA1-4.1 Cartesian sampling plans sample equal areas inthe interior of the wafer surface, but fail to sampleportions of the wafer near its perimeter. They may notprovide sufficient information about the outermostportion of the fixed quality area for a given application.See Figure A1-3 for an illustration in the case of a 37-point Cartesian sampling plan.A1-4.2 These plans have a grid of equal-sized cells,equally spaced about the center of the wafer. Ameasurement is made in the center of each cell. Thenumber of rows and columns in the grid, always an oddnumber, is chosen according to wafer diameter,estimated sampling area for the measurement being

The square cells in this plan arenot necessarily the shape or size of the sampling area for the measurement being used. In general, make sure thatthe sampling area for the measurement is smaller than the dimensions of the square.

Use Table A1-2as a guide to the approximate number of measurementsites for various numbers of rows and columns of cells.To calculate the dimensions of the square cells, dividethe outermost radius, Ro, determined in Section A1.1,by N, the desired number of rows and columns. Theexact number of sites that will be measured is governedby the number of cells near the wafer perimeter thatneed to be excluded because the center of the cell, thatis, the center of the measurement spot, does not fallwithin the radius Ro.A1-4.4 Use test instrument software to establish thecoordinates of the center of all cells as determined fromthe ratio Ro/NC , calculated in Section A1-4.3. Disallowmeasurement sites near the wafer perimeter such thatthe radial distance to the center of the cell, that is, thecenter of the measurement spot, is larger than Ro. Thisfollows the same rationale for allowed measurementsites as is used with the concentric circle plans.A1-4.5 Take measurements at all sites allowed inaccordance with Table A1-2. The measurementsequence, whether starting from the center point andmoving outward or starting from one edge a row orcolumn at a time, is to be decided by the parties to thetest.A1-4.6 Calculate the uniformity based on the differencebetween the maximum and minimum measured values,HLV(%), and on the standard deviation as a percent ofthe mean of all measurements, SUP(%), as detailed inSection 9.3. A1-5 Single-Diameter Sampling PlanA1-5.1 This plan uses a very high density ofmeasurements along a diameter and includes ameasurement at the wafer center. It is shownschematically in Figure A1-4 for the diameter beingparallel to a major wafer flat. However, in the case ofnotched wafers, the notch would replace the flat in thefigure. It is also possible, by agreement of the parties tothe test, to make the measurements along a diameter at a specified angle with respect to the fiducial axis aslong as such an angle is then stated in the report.A1-5.2 Choose a value, NM , for the number ofmeasurements, where NM is at least 25. The separationbetween measurement sites is given by 2Ro/(NM  1),where Ro is determined as in Section A1-1.1. 2R o/(N M 1) NOTE: The radius R o is given by Equation A1-1 for MethodA and by Equation A1-2 for Method B.Figure A1-4Illustration of Single-Diameter, High-DensityMeasurement Site PlanA1-5.2.2 Compare the site separation, 2Ro/(NM  1),with the estimated measurement sampling area or spotsize. If the interval is smaller than this value, littleadditional information may be obtained by choosing solarge a value for NM; it may be appropriate to reduce NMso that the new calculated site separation is equal to orgreater than the measurement sampling area.A1-5.3 Establish the coordinates for all measurementsites using the site interval value just calculated and thewafer center as the reference point. Takemeasurements at all sites.A1-5.4 Calculate the uniformity based on the differencebetween the maximum and minimum measured values,HLV(%), and on the standard deviation as a percent ofthe mean of all measurements, SUP(%), as detailed inSection 9.3.

Current edition approved for publication bythe North American Regional Standards Committee on March 14, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.orgMay 2004; to be published July 2004. Original edition published by ASTM International as ASTM F 1630-95. Last previous edition SEMI MF1630-00.1 Purpose1.1 Electronic grade polysilicon producers and usersrely on LTFT-IR spectroscopy to evaluate polysiliconfor quality assurance and research purposes.1.2 LTFT-IR spectroscopy identifies and quantitatesboron, phosphorus, aluminum, arsenic, indium,antimony, and gallium.1.3 LTFT-IR spectroscopy can be applied to FZ, CZ, orother single crystal silicon (either doped or undoped) upto the concentration limits given in Section 2.2.1.4 The measurement of carbon in silicon at lowtemperature can be accomplished concurrently inaccordance with SEMI MF1391. The carbon can bemeasured at lower concentrations at &lt;15 K than ispossible at room temperature because the two-phononband transmission is increased by a factor of twoallowing greater throughput to the detector that resultsin an increased signal to noise ratio. Also the carbonadsorption band narrows from a FWHM of 5 to 6 cm1to a FWHM of 2.5 to 3.0 cm1 at these lowtemperatures. 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers the determination ofelectrically active boron, phosphorus, arsenic,aluminum, antimony, and gallium concentration insingle crystal silicon.2.2 This test method can be used for silicon in whichthe impurity/dopant concentrations are between 0.01ppba and 5.0 ppba for each of the electrically activeelements.2.3 The concentration for each impurity/dopant can beobtained by application of Beers Law. Calibrationfactors are given for each element.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior touse. 3 Limitations3.1 The sample specimen must be colder than 15 K formeasurement of electrically active species. If thesample specimen is mounted on a cold finger, care mustbe taken to obtain good contact between the samplespecimen and the cold finger for efficient heat transfer.The oxygen absorption lines at 1136 cm1 and 1128cm1 are sensitive to temperature and can be used todetermine the specimen temperature.1 When thesample specimen is less than 15 K the net absorbance at1136 cm1 is three times larger than the net absorbanceat 1128 cm1. A ratio of greater than three is obtainedfor temperatures below 15 K.3.2 Without sufficient incident white light thecompensated donors and acceptors will not absorb.Therefore, the white light intensity must be greatenough to completely neutralize all the compensateddonors and acceptors. The intensity of the white lightnecessary must be determined for each system. Theuser should increase the intensity of the white light untilfurther increase in intensity no longer affects thearea/height of the electrically active impurity/dopantpeaks.3.3 Water vapor absorption interferes with themeasurement of several peaks. Consequently, thebackground spectrum should be collected at least daily.The entire light path, including the sample chamber,must be purged to remove moisture. Special careshould be taken whenever a sample specimen ischanged so that the moisture level in the samplechamber or elsewhere in the light path is not affected.3.4 Oxygen level in Czochralski silicon can be highenough to exhibit thermal donor absorption lines.These lines fall between 400 cm1 and 550 cm1 andcan interfere with aluminum (473 cm1), gallium (548cm1), and occasionally arsenic (382 cm1 ). Thermaldonors can be removed by annealing the samplespecimen. 1 Rome, J.

This cryostat may be liquidhelium immersion, exchange gas, or closed cyclerefrigeration.7.2 Sample Specimen Holder  Constructed of highheat conductivity metal with an aperture(s) to block anyof the infrared beam except that passing through thesample.NOTE 1: The procedure of Section 11 is based on theassumption that the cryostat can accommodate and utilizes amulti-sample holder.7.3 White-light Source  As shown in Figure 1. Figure 1Sample Holder and Optics Suitable for Illuminationwith White Light via Fiber Optics 7.4 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR) Must be equipped with suitable optics and detectorfor use in the region from 250 cm1 to 1300 cm1.7.4.1 The spectrometer shall be capable of at least 1.0cm1 resolution.

A room temperature DTGSwith a CsI window suffices for the higherconcentrations of elements in this test method.However, a zinc-doped germanium Ge:Zn detectoroperated at 4.4 to 10.0 K is preferred to give a signal-to-noise ratio sufficient to properly determine the elements at the lower concentrations and for improvedprecision.7.5 Calcium Fluoride Crystal (CaF2)  Cut to nominalthickness of 5 mm. 8 Sample Preparation8.1 If the samples are from polysilicon, they must firstbe converted to single crystal in accordance with SEMIMF1723 or other established means.8.2 Sample specimen shall be cut and polished to fit thesample specimen holder. The surface may bemechanically or chemically polished. Each samplespecimen shall have a thickness variation of less than1% of overall thickness.8.3 For measurement of electrically active impurities,the sample specimen thickness should be as follows:8.3.1 For high purity silicon (&gt;2000 Ωcm): 3 to 5 mmto allow for lower detection limits.8.3.2 Between 5 and 20 mm in cases where impuritylevels to be measured are below 0.01 ppba.8.3.3 For heavily doped silicon (&lt;10 Ωcm): 1 to 2 mmto allow greater transmission of the infrared radiation. 9 Reference Specimens9.1 One or more silicon samples that contain impuritiesin the range of the samples to be tested shall beclassified as reference specimens. These referencespecimens should be analyzed repeatedly andperiodically according to this test method. Compare theresults obtained to previous data to establish that themeasurement process is in control. 10 Testing of the Instrument10.1 Establish FT-IR instrument stability by checkingthe 100% transmittance line.10.1.1 Collect and store two background spectrasequentially through an open aperture of the cryostatspecimen holder.10.1.2 Ratio these two spectrum to obtain atransmittance spectrum.10.1.3 Examine the spectrum from 1200 cm1 to 250cm1. The spectrum should be 100 ± 0.5% T over thisrange. Proceed only if the spectrum is 100 ± 5% overthis range, otherwise correct any instrumentalinstability.

The observedresponse in this region should be less than 1.0% of themaximum response over the 1200 to 250 cm1 region.If not, take corrective action before proceeding.10.2.2 Alternatively, collect a spectrum with a CaF2crystal wafer, 5 mm-thick, in the IR beam. Ratio thisspectrum relative to one of the background spectrumobtained in Section 10.1.1 to obtain a transmittancespectrum. CaF 2 is totally opaque below 800 cm1. Thespectrum must give 0.0 ± 0.5% transmittance from 800to 250 cm1. If not, take corrective action beforeproceeding. 11 Procedure11.1 Measure the thicknesses to ±0.02 mm and load allthe sample specimens to be examined onto the samplespecimen holder leaving at least one open slot. Includea reference specimen to serve as an audit to ensure thatthe entire instrument is performing correctly.11.2 Mount them in the cryostat and cool the samples toless than 15 K.11.3 Set instrumental parameters to give a resolution of1.0 cm1 or better.11.4 Select the reference specimen as the first sample tobe measured.11.5 Collect 1000 scans of an empty sample chamberslot and use this as the background spectrum.11.6 Move the sample specimen into position.11.7 Turn on the incident white-light source and ensurethat the sample specimen is fully illuminated with whitelight and properly aligned relative to the IR beam (seeFigure 1).11.8 Collect a minimum of 300 scans of the sample.11.9 Zero-fill, apodize, and transform the interferograminto a spectrum and then ratio it to the backgroundspectrum.11.10 Covert to an absorbance spectrum and use as thesample specimen spectrum. 6 Chase, D. B., Nonlinear Detector Response in FT-IR, AppliedSpectroscopy 38(4), 491494 (1984). 11.11 Store this spectrum and subsequent ones forfurther manipulation and measurement of the peakareas.11.12 Repeat Sections 11.5 through 11.11 for eachsample specimen. 12 Data Reduction12.1 This test procedure requires the measurement ofthe areas of the absorption bands before calculation ofthe concentration of each element. The absorptionbands are very sharp, especially for the Group Velements, and therefore peak height measurements aredifficult to reproduce from instrument to instrument.Use of peak areas greatly reduces this variability.12.1.1 Establish baselines for each peak beforemeasurement of the area. Use only the area above theestablished baseline in the calculations. Severalalgorithms are available on various commercial FT-IRinstruments to obtain the desired baseline correctedareas. The following is one suggested method:12.1.1.1 Retrieve the sample absorbance spectrumfrom the computer storage disk. With the wavenumberexpand commands available, zoom in on the region ofthe absorption band(s) of interest. Expand until thisregion is only slightly larger than the baseline limitregions given in Table 1.12.1.1.2 Employ the interactive baseline correctionroutine to bring the spectral baseline to coincide withthe 0.0 absorbance line. Refer to Table 1 for the upperand lower wavenumber regions for guidance inadjusting the baseline. Expand in the absorbance scaleas necessary to improve the observation of the noiseand fine features of the spectrum in order to provide thebest placement of the baseline. Apply only linearcorrections with the fit of the straight line through thepoints on both sides of the absorption peak(s). Notethat the peaks for boron and phosphorus are very closetogether and thus only one baseline is obtainedsurrounding both peaks. Figures 2 and 3 show spectrabefore and after, respectively, baseline correction forboron and phosphorus spectral region.12.1.2 Measure the area for the absorption peakbetween the upper and lower wavenumbers given inTable 1 for the integration limits. Most computeralgorithms handle this nicely. However, disable theautomatic zeroing of the baseline at the integrationlimits. If not disabled, the integration would notrepresent the baseline as established in Section 12.1.1and may result in errors.12.1.3 Repeat Sections 12.1.1 and 12.1.2 for eachcomponent desired for each specimen measured.

SEMI MF1630-0704 © SEMI 20047 RELATED INFORMATION 1DERIVATION OF FACTORS USED IN CALCULATINGCONCENTRATIONS AND DENSITIES OF ELEMENTS IN SILICON NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI MF1630. It was developed as non-mandatoryinformation in ASTM during the initial development of the document in 1994-5. This related information wasapproved for publication by SEMI by full letter ballot procedures on March 14, 2004. R1-1 The factors shown in Table 1 resulted fromseveral years of corrections and modifications but areultimately based on resistivity measurements on siliconsamples. The dopant density, or the concentration ofimpurities for this test method, is directly obtainedfrom the conversion Tables found in SEMI MF723.R1-2 Babers 5 calibration factors published in 1980,were the starting point for the current factors.Corrections or modifications, or both, to his publisheddata follow in this discussion.R1-2.1 Babers LTFT-IR study utilized the conversionrelations reported by Irvin7 in 1962, relating resistivityand impurity concentrations. Currently, the conversiontables given in SEMI MF723 are believed to be morereliable. Corrections to Babers factors were made toreflect these new conversion tables.R1-2.2 The factors of Baber relate peak heights of theabsorption bands to concentrations. Peak heights areextremely sensitive to several FT-IR parameters. Thephosphorus band at 316.0 cm1 and the arsenic band at382.0 cm1 are very narrow, about 0.25 cm1, and thusthe peak heights of these bands vary greatly withnominal resolution, type of apodization, degree of zero-filling, and mechanical strain on the sample. The boronabsorption at 319.6 cm1 band used in this test methodis actually a composite of four separate boronabsorption bands. The variability of the measurementof the absorption bands is reduced considerably whenpeak areas are used instead of peak heights. The use ofpeak areas is common in the field and their use isspecified in this test method.R1-2.3 Further minor modifications have been madeover the in the period from about 1985 to about 1995 inseveral laboratories that use LTFT-IR spectrometers fordetermination of electrically active impurities.R1-2.3.1 Studies with and without the white light onthe silicon samples, covering a wide range ofconcentrations, are valuable as tools to check forconsistency of the boron and phosphorus factors, whichare indeed the most common impurities. With theabsence of white light, the LTFT-IR method shows 7 Irvin, J. C., Resistivity of Bulk Silicon Diffused Layers inSilicon, Bell System Tech. J. 41, 387410 (1962). only the net carrier absorption bands at an intensityproportional to the excess majority carrierconcentration. These data along with the totalimpurities obtained with white light on the samplespermitted minor adjustments to the boron orphosphorus factors, or both.R1-2.3.2 Silicon samples whose resistivity has beencarefully determined have been measured by LTFT-IRspectroscopy, and the results used to confirm or slightlymodify the calibration factors.R1-3 In 1990, a pilot study was conducted in which tensilicon samples were examined at four differentlaboratories by either LTFT-IR or photoluminescence,or both, and the results compared. Even though eachlaboratory used their own factors and modifications ofthis test method for determination of impurityconcentrations, the data for boron and phosphorus allagreed to within ± 20% of the average value. Thefactors given in this test method are approximatelyequal to the average values from that study.R1-4 In summary, the factors given in Table 1 are aresult of continued refinement as more and bettermeasurements have been made. However, theyultimately correspond to the resistivity measurementsand the conversion to dopant (impurity) concentrationsas given in SEMI MF723. The factors for boron andphosphorus have the highest degree of certainty sincethese two elements are the most commonly measuredand are therefore studied the most. The factors for theother elements, especially aluminum, antimony,gallium, and indium, should be considered onlyapproximations and used only to estimate theirconcentrations in silicon.

Current edition approved for publication by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.orgSeptember 2004; to be published November 2004. Original edition published by ASTM International asASTM F 1708-96. Last previous edition SEMI MF1708-02 1 Purpose1.1 Polycrystalline silicon is used as the startingmaterial for growth of large single crystal ingots byCzochralski methods.1.2 Although Czochralski grown ingots are intention-ally doped during crystal growth to the desiredresistivity and type, the dopant levels in the polysiliconmust be known to calculate the amount of dopant to beadded. This practice provides a means to determine theimpurity levels in granular polysilicon to be used forcrystal growth.1.3 Carbon levels in polysilicon must be known so thatthe concentration of carbon in the ingot can becontrolled to a low level.1.4 This practice has applicability in production control,quality assurance, materials research, and materialsacceptance. 2 Scope2.1 This practice describes a procedure to consolidategranular polysilicon into a solid rod and then to convertthe polysilicon rod into a single crystal by a float-zonetechnique. The resultant single crystal ingot is used forthe determination of trace impurities in the polysilicon.These impurities are acceptor and donor components(usually boron, aluminum, phosphorus, arsenic, andantimony) as well as substitutional carbon.2.2 The useful range of impurity concentration coveredby this practice is 0.002 to 100 parts per billion atomic(ppba) for acceptor and donor impurities, and 0.02 to 15parts per million atomic (ppma) for carbon. Theacceptor and donor impurities in a slice taken from thesingle crystal ingot are analyzed by photoluminescenceor infrared spectroscopies. The carbon impurity isdetermined by analysis of a slice by infraredspectroscopy.2.3 This practice is applicable only to evaluation ofpolysilicon granules as produced by thermaldecomposition and deposition of silane, or one of thechlorosilanes, onto high purity seeds of polysilicon in acontinuous or batch fluid bed reactor. The granules are near spherical in shape and range in size from 200 to3000 m with a mean size of about 9001200 m.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior touse. 3 Limitations3.1 The quartz tubes used in this procedure must be ofhigh purity, especially in regards to the impurities to bemeasured. Boron is of particular concern since it isalways present in quartz and may frequently appear inuncharacteristically high concentrations in polysilicon.3.2 All chemicals and gases used in this procedure mustbe free of components to be measured or they may giveextraneously high results.3.3 Loss of single crystal during the zone pass willproduce an ingot that may give unsatisfactory results.The quality of the infrared or photoluminescencespectra usually reveals the lack of single crystal. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI C3.42  Specification for ArgonSEMI C28  Specifications and Guidelines forHydrofluoric AcidSEMI C31  Specification for MethanolSEMI C34  Specification and Guideline for MixedAcid EtchantsSEMI C35  Specifications and Guideline for NitricAcidSEMI MF1241  Terminology of Silicon TechnologySEMI MF1389  Test Methods for PhotoluminescenceAnalysis of Single Crystal Silicon for III-V ImpuritiesSEMI MF1391  Test Method for SubstitutionalCarbon Content of Silicon by Infrared Absorption

Afterabout 15 g of polysilicon has been melted and cooled inthe zone process, a polysilicon rod about 8 to 12 mm indiameter and up to 70 mm in length is obtained.6.1.2 In the second step, a single crystal silicon seed ismelted into the tail end of the polycrystalline rod and asingle zone pass is done in the upward direction to levelthe impurities and to convert the silicon to a singlecrystal rod. This produces a single crystal silicon ingotabout 8 to 12 mm in diameter and up to 70 mm inlength from which a section is sliced for measurementof impurities. The entire consolidation and zoningrequires about 30 min to accomplish.6.1.3 A slice 2 to 4 mm thick is taken from the centerone-third of the single crystal silicon ingot formeasurement of impurities by infrared orphotoluminescence spectroscopies. 7 Apparatus7.1 Acid Exhaust Fume Hood  To provide for exhaustof acid fumes, a clean air environment (ISO Class 6minimum, as defined in ISO 14544-1), a drain for acidsand water, and a deionized water supply. This hoodprovides for the cleaning of quartz containers, funnels,and tubes used in the melter/zoner as well as a place toetch silicon pieces and samples used in this practice.NOTE 1: ISO class 6 is about the same as Class 1000 asdefined in Federal Standard 209E). 7.2 Laminar Flow Hood  To provide a flow of clean(ISO Class 6 minimum) air for drying of componentsand the etched and clean silicon pieces.7.3 Quartz Sample Containers  200 to 300 mLcapacity quartz bottles to contain and transport granularpolysilicon samples.7.4 Quartz Funnel  A funnel of sufficient size totransfer granular polysilicon from the sample containerto the 15 mm inside diameter quartz tube.7.5 Quartz Tube  A section of high purity quartz tubewith 18 mm outside diameter, 15 mm inside diameter,and a length of 556 mm. The inside diameter andoutside diameter variances should be small to avoidproblems with clearances both internally and externally.This tube provides the working enclosure for both theconsolidation and the zone leveling within the confinesof the working coil of the melter/float zone apparatus.

Hydrofluoric acid (HF) solutions areespecially hazardous to the eyes, skin, mucousmembranes, and the lungs. Anyone using HF and otheracids must be familiar with the potential hazards andmust employ proper techniques and preventivemeasures to avoid injury.9.2 The rf generator and coil of the melter-zonerapparatus can be injurious to the operator if the operatoris not properly trained in working with electricalconnections, rf fields, and hot parts.9.3 Use eye protection to protect the operator from thebright light of the molten silicon in the melter-zonerapparatus. 10 Sampling10.1 Granular polysilicon samples are best handled inclean, dry quartz bottles. Samples are always takenwith clean silicon or quartz scoops or devices.10.2 Granular polysilicon is commercially produced bya continuous process in a fluidized bed reactor.Samples for evaluation by this practice can be taken inprocess, while packaging (normally in 270300 kgspecially lined drums), or at the point of use. Thesampling point is therefore determined by the purposeof the evaluation. 11 Reference Specimen11.1 Use a large homogeneous sample of granularpolysilicon reference material to monitor the process ofconsolidation and conversion to a single crystal silicon.Periodically and repeatedly convert this referencematerial to single crystal silicon to establish theconsistency and cleanliness of this practice.11.2 Collect and statistically evaluate the valuesobtained by low-temperature Fourier transform infraredspectroscopy for carbon and the acceptor and donorimpurities in the analytical slices to establish and keepthe process in control. 12 Preparation of Apparatus12.1 Take the utmost care to ensure the cleanliness ofall parts of the melter/zoner, especially the quartz tube,sample containers, transfer funnel, and the carriageendpieces.12.1.1 Clean the inner part of the quartz tube and etchit with 3:1 HF:HNO 3. Following the acid etch, rinse thetube with copious amounts of DI water and allow it todry in a laminar air flow hood.12.1.1.1 Warning: Acids, especially HF, are veryhazardous to the eyes, skin, mucous membranes, andlungs. Anyone using these acids must be familiar withand use precautionary means to avoid injury.12.1.2 Etch, clean and dry other quartz parts, includingsample containers and funnels as in Section 12.1.1except that the etchant used is 1:1 HF:H 2O.12.1.3 Carefully clean the carriage endpieces, stainlesssteel rods, and chucks of the melter/zoner by rinsingwith methanol and allowing them to thoroughly dry inthe clean room environment.12.2 Prepare the silicon pedestals and single crystalseed rods for use by etching with a continuous streamof the MAE for 15 to 20 s, followed quickly with acopious rinse of DI water. Air dry or blot dry with lint-free paper. 13 Procedure13.1 Assemble a freshly etched and dried quartz tubeinto the carriage endpieces.NOTE 2: Freshly, as referred to here and the followingparagraphs, refers to a time of less than 1 h. 13.2 Mount a freshly etched and dried silicon pedestal(6 by 6 by 100 mm) in the upper chuck and place in theupper endpiece. Center the silicon pedestal within thequartz tube. Adjust the carriage so that the bottom ofthe silicon pedestal is inside but not below the workingrf coil. Remove the pedestal and chuck and set asidefor later use.13.3 Mount a freshly cleaned PTFE plunger-diffuserpart on the lower rod assembly and place it inside thebottom of the quartz tube. Secure the rod assembly tothe lower endpiece and carefully move the rod andplunger to a point of about 100 to 120 mm below the rfcoil. Start the argon purge and diffuser gas flow at arate of about 0.1 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM)through the lower portal, PTFE diffuser, and exhaustout the top of the open quartz tube through the upperendpiece.13.4 Introduce the granular polysilicon sample throughthe upper end piece with a quartz funnel. Fill with

&lt;!-- Page 43 --&gt;

SEMI MF1708-1104 © SEMI 20045 about 25 g of polysilicon until the upper bed of granulesis near the lower part of the rf coil. Reduce the argonflow until only the top layer of granules are fluidized.13.5 Remove the funnel and replace the upper chuckand silicon pedestal. Reposition the carriage so that thepedestal is midway between the rf coil.13.6 Ignite the hydrogen-air torch and position itslightly above and about 30 mm from the working coilimpacting the outside of the quartz tube. Turn on andincrease the rf power to about 80% of the operatingpower needed for melting. Watch for rf coupling withthe silicon rod, which will occur in about 2 min as isevident from the red glow of the pedestal. Turn off thetorch and move the carriage upward at a rate that thered hot zone follows the rf coil until the hot zone is atthe bottom of the silicon pedestal.13.7 Increase the rf power until the bottom of thepedestal melts. Move the position of the granulesupward with the lower rod and PTFE plunger until thetop of the fluidized bed begins to melt into the upperpedestal. As the granules melt into the upper pedestal,move the entire carriage upward.NOTE 3: The melt freezes as it leaves the working zone ofthe rf coil. The consolidated rod diameter is smaller than theinside diameter of the quartz tube so it does not contact thetube walls. 13.8 Continue consolidation growth with minoradjustments until a consolidated polysilicon rod ofabout 9 mm in diameter and 60 mm in length isobtained. Lower the polysilicon granules bed andreduce the rf power permitting the tail end of the rod tosolidify. Note the time required for the melting process(normally about 12 min).13.9 Remove the lower rod and plunger from the quartztube by removal of part of the lower endpiece. Let theexcess polysilicon granules fall out the bottom of thetube and discard them.13.10 Remove the PTFE plunger/diffuser from thelower stainless steel rod and replace it with the lowerseed chuck (see Figure 1).13.11 Mount a freshly etched and dried single crystalsilicon seed (2.5 by 2.5 by 100 mm) in the lower chuck.Place the silicon seed rod, chuck, and lower rod into thequartz tube through the bottom as before. Move thelower rod upward until the seed crystal is about 5 mmbelow the tip of the consolidated polysilicon rodpreviously produced. Purge the entire tube for aminimum of 1 min at a flow rate of 0.5 SCFM.13.12 Reduce the argon purge to about 0.1 SCFM.Reignite the hydrogen torch and increase the rf powerto 80% needed to melt silicon. Watch for the glow of the consolidated polysilicon rod as rf coupling begins.Shut off the torch.13.13 Increase rf power until the consolidatedpolysilicon rod tip is molten and then raise the seed topenetrate into the melt. Hold in this position until theseed has taken sufficient heat to melt and becomes onewith the melt from the consolidated polysilicon rod.13.14 In a trial and error mode, increase the rf power asneeded to carry out the one pass zone leveling. Whenthe proper rf power is established, activate themotorized carriage for movement downward (floatingzone movement is upward) at a rate to match thatemployed during the consolidation process, typically azone rate of about 5.0 mm per minute. Continue thezoning until the entire consolidated polysilicon rod hasbeen converted to a single crystal as is evident by thefour growth facet lines. Now, slightly reduce the rfpower and slowly move the lower rod downwardseparating the single crystal ingot from the polysiliconrod. Turn off the rf power. Allow about 2 min for theingot to cool.13.15 Remove the single crystal ingot and break off theseed crystal after scoring with a diamond scribe. Savethe remaining seed for growth of the next crystal.Examine the crystal to be sure the growth facet linesextend the entire length of the ingot.13.16 Mount the crystal in the saw chuck and cut ananalytical slice 2 to 4 mm thick as needed from thecenter one-third of the crystal.NOTE 4: Since segregation of the impurities occurs bothduring the consolidation step and the conversion to singlecrystal, the one pass zone during the conversion to singlecrystal at the same rate as the consolidation step effectivelylevels these impurities. Thus, the concentration of theimpurities in the ingot is essentially constant except at bothextremes. 13.17 Prepare the analytical slice for infrared orphotoluminescence spectroscopic measurements withapplication of a bright chemical etch or a mechanicalpolish.13.17.1 To etch, hold the slice with polyethyleneforceps and suspend it into a PTFE beaker filled withthe mixed acid etchant as described in Section 8.5.Gently stir the solution with a magnetic stir bar whileimmersing the silicon slice for 4 min. Remove andquickly rinse with copious amounts of DI water. Airdry the silicon slice, which is now ready for analysis.13.18 Utilize the appropriate test methods for thedesired analysis. For carbon content, test by infraredspectrophotometry in accordance with SEMI MF1391.For determination of donor and acceptor contents, testeither by low-temperature FT-IR analysis in accordance

In reality, there is alwayssmall impurity contamination during the consolidationand conversion to a single crystal. This contaminationleads to results higher than actually present in thegranular polysilicon. 15 Precision15.1 In the mid-nineties, the precision of this practicewas established by one laboratory as follows: A largesample of granular polysilicon was evaluated repeatedlyand periodically by this practice for over more than ayear. Low temperature Fourier transform infraredspectroscopy was used to measure the impurityconcentrations. The combined errors of samplehandling, consolidation to polysilicon rod, conversionto a single crystal ingot, and the infrared determinationsgave a standard deviation of 0.03 ppba at the 0.06 ppbaconcentration level for boron and phosphorus and astandard deviation of 0.03 ppma for interstitial carbonat the 0.07 ppma level. 15.2 Analysis of more recent similar data indicates thatthe standard deviation is less than 0.02 ppba at the 0.04ppba concentration level for boron and phosphorus and0.02 ppma for interstitial carbon at the 0.05 ppma level. 16 Keywords16.1 granular polysilicon; polycrystalline silicon;polysilicon consolidation; polysilicon evaluation;polysilicon impurities NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representa-tions as to the suitability of the standards set forthherein for any particular application.

SEMI MF1723-1104 © SEMI 20041 SEMI MF1723-1104PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICONRODS BY FLOAT-ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.orgSeptember 2004; to be published November 2004. Original edition published by ASTM International asASTM F 1723-96. Last previous edition SEMI MF1723-02.1 Purpose1.1 The concentration of acceptor and donor impuritiesin polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) is used by thegrower of monocrystalline silicon ingots to calculatethe additional dopant needed to produce the requiredingot resistivity or to predict the resistivity of undopedingots.1.2 The concentration of acceptor and donor elementsand carbon in the polysilicon is used by the crystalgrower to determine material acceptance.1.3 The concentration of impurities in the polysiliconis used for monitoring source gas purity, polysiliconproduction processes, development of new processes,and materials acceptance purposes.1.4 This practice describes the sampling system andfloat-zone crystal growth procedures used to preparepolysilicon core samples for analysis of acceptor,donor, and carbon content. 2 Scope2.1 This practice covers procedures for samplingpolycrystalline silicon rods and growing single crystalsfrom these samples by the float-zone technique. Theresultant single crystal ingots are analyzed byspectrophotometric methods to determine the traceimpurities in the polysilicon. These trace impurities areacceptor (usually boron or aluminum, or both), donor(usually phosphorus or arsenic, or both), and carbonimpurities.2.2 The useful range of impurity concentration coveredby this practice is 0.002 to 100 parts per billion atomic(ppba) for acceptor and donor impurities, and 0.02 to 15parts per million atomic (ppma) for carbon impurity.These impurities are analyzed in the ingot samples byinfrared or photoluminescence spectroscopy.2.3 This practice is applicable only to evaluation ofpolysilicon ingots grown by a method that utilizes aslim silicon rod (filament) upon which the polycrystal-line silicon is deposited. NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior touse. 3 Limitations3.1 Polysilicon rods that are cracked, highly stressed,or have deep dendritic growth cannot be sampled due toshattering or breaking during the coring process.3.2 Polysilicon cores with fractures, cracked surfaces,or voids in the surface are difficult to clean. Impuritiesare not completely etched out of the cracks or voids, oretch residues may remain in the cracks, thus contrib-uting contamination. Cracked or highly stressed coresmay shatter or break during the zoning process. Coresmust be cleaned after fabrication to remove any oil,grease, or handling contamination.3.3 The purity of the acids and deionized water (DI) iscritically important. Impurities in the acids, etchingapparatus, or water may interfere with accurate,reproducible analysis. Etching and zoning should bedone in a clean room to minimize impurities from theambient air, walls, floors, and furniture. The specificacid mixture, acid etch temperature, silicon removalrate, number of etch-rinse cycles, and exposure time areother factors that must be monitored and controlled toprevent impurity interferences. Any materials thatcontact the etched cores, such as boats and containers,must be cleaned before use and monitored to preventcontamination. Gloves or other materials used to wrapthe etched cores must be tested and monitored toprevent contamination.3.4 The zoner itself, especially the preheater, canintroduce impurities into the growing silicon ingot. Thewalls, preheater, coil, and seals of the zoner are usualsources of contamination. Maintaining a clean zoner isvery important to the procedures covered by thispractice.

SEMI MF1723-1104 © SEMI 2004 2 3.5 Any variation from the prescribed float-zoningprocedures that can affect the distribution of the volatileimpurities in the gas, liquid, and solid phases will alterthe results. Variations in core diameter, zone dimen-sions, pull rate, seal purity, or ambient conditions mayalter the effective distribution coefficient or evaporationrate and thus change the amount of impurity incorpor-ated into the crystal.3.6 Each acceptor or donor element and carbon haveunique segregation coefficients. By growing severalingots with lengths up to 30 times the zone length, theeffective segregation coefficient can be measured.These should agree with published values. 1,2 Wafersare cut from this ingot at equilibrium positionscorresponding to the segregation coefficient. Waferscut from other locations may not accurately representthe amount of impurity in the polysilicon. If ingots cannot be grown to sufficient length to achieve the flatportion of the axial concentration profile, wafers can becut from the ingot, and the measured values correctedfor the effective segregation coefficient, based onrepeated measurements of control rods.3.7 In the conversion of the core to a monocrystalduring zoning, it is possible to lose structure and have azoned rod that is not monocrystalline. Ingots withexcessive crystallographic defects give photolumines-cence or infrared spectra with excessive noise; suchspectra are difficult to interpret accurately. In extremecases, it is not possible to obtain acceptable spectra. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI C3.42  Specification for ArgonSEMI C28  Specifications and Guidelines for Hydro-fluoric AcidSEMI C35  Specifications and Guideline for NitricAcidSEMI MF26  Test Methods for Determining theOrientation of a Semiconductive Single CrystalSEMI MF42  Test Methods for Conductivity Type ofExtrinsic Semiconducting MaterialsSEMI MF397  Test Method for Resistivity of SiliconBars Using a Two-Point ProbeSEMI MF723  Practice for Conversion BetweenResistivity and Dopant Density for Boron-Doped,Phosphorus-Doped, and Arsenic-Doped SiliconSEMI MF1241  Terminology of Silicon Technology 1 Pfann, W., Zone Melting, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1958.2 Keller, W., et al., Floating Zone Silicon, Marcel Dekker, Inc., NewYork, 1981.

SEMI MF1723-1104 © SEMI 20043 5.1.2.3 deposition layer (growth layer), n  the layerof polysilicon surrounding the filament, extending tothe outer diameter of the poly rod.5.1.2.4 filament, slim rod, n  a small diametersilicon rod, assembled into a U-shape, used to provide asubstrate or seed for the deposition of polycrystallinesilicon. 6 Summary of Practice6.1 One or more core samples, selected according to aprescribed plan, are taken from the polysilicon rod to beevaluated. Cores can be taken parallel or perpendicularto the filament at both ends of the rod. The preparationand zoning process is the same for both types, but thedata calculation and carbon analysis are different.6.2 After inspection for damage, the polysilicon coresare identified and scheduled for etching and crystalgrowth. Cores are etched in acid, rinsed clean, mountedinto a float-zone crystal growth apparatus, andconverted to single crystal ingots. Cores must be float-zoned as soon as possible after being etched to avoidsurface contamination. Studies in one laboratory in anISO Class 5 (Note 1) clean room indicated that surfacecontamination can occur after 36 h. For eachlaboratory, maximum holding times and handling-packaging procedures must be determined. Cores mustbe reetched if the maximum holding period is exceeded.To extend the holding period, cores may be wrappedand sealed in a suitably clean material and stored in aclean environment until use.NOTE 1: ISO Class 5 as defined in ISO 14644-1 is about thesame as Class 100 as defined in Federal Standard 209E. 6.3 A control rod is etched and float-zoned along withthe sample rods to monitor any contamination inter-ferences from the sample preparation and float zoningprocess.6.4 The polysilicon cores are converted to singlecrystal ingots by the float-zone technique, using onezone pass in an argon atmosphere. After crystal growthis completed, the ingots are checked formonocrystalline character, diameter, and length.6.5 Sections of the ingot are selected for measurementof acceptor, donor, and carbon content, according to theindividual segregation coefficients for these elements.6.6 From the selected sections of the ingot, wafers arecut and prepared for analysis by spectrophotometrictechniques described in SEMI MF1389, SEMIMF1391, and SEMI MF1630. 7 Apparatus7.1 Coring Equipment7.1.1 Drill Press  With water cooling capability.7.1.2 Diamond Core Drill  Bit sized to produce a 20mm diameter (approximate) polysilicon core at least100 mm in length for parallel cores and a lengthsuitable to drill completely through the rod diameter forperpendicular cores. Drill diameters of 3 mm or 5 mmare used for seed preparation.7.2 Etching Equipment7.2.1 Etch Bench  Located in an ISO Class 6 CleanRoom, as defined in ISO 14644-1, to minimize ambientcontamination, with adequate exhaust for acid fumes,tanks for etching acid and DI water rinsing, and facilityfor drying samples in a clean environment.NOTE 2: ISO Class 6 is about the same as Class 1000 asdefined in Federal Standard 209E. 7.2.2 Quartz Boats  Or other acid-resistant material,such as polytetrafluoroethylene, designed to hold poly-silicon rods of the specified diameter and length, duringthe etching, rinsing, and drying process.7.3 Float Zone Crystal Growth Equipment7.3.1 Float Zone Crystal Growth Furnace  With aninert gas atmosphere, and water-cooled chamber ofsufficient size to accommodate growth of ingots ofspecified diameter and length, located in a clean roomof ISO Class 6 or better. The apparatus shall allowrelative vertical motion of the work, with respect to thecoil, with no significant lateral motion. This verticalmotion may be accomplished by screw, cable, orhydraulic mechanisms. In addition, there shall be ashaft to support the core sample and a shaft to supportthe seed. At least one shaft shall be capable of verticaldisplacement relative to the other. The seed shaft shallbe rotated about its longitudinal axis as a precautionagainst thermal and solute asymmetries in the moltenzone. Either the sample or seed chuck shall be free toslip with respect to the rotation in the event of freezingof the molten zone. The sample and seed chucks shallbe of molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten, or quartz tominimize contamination of the silicon. The coil designand power control shall maintain a stable, completelymolten zone during the entire growth process. Materi-als used in the apparatus shall have vapor pressures lessthan 1  106 torr under operating conditions. Thesusceptor (preheater) shall be about the same diameteras the sample core and made of tantalum, or othermaterial that minimize the contamination of the silicon.

Good laboratorypractices also must be understood. 9.2 This practice uses hot acid to etch away the surfaceof the polysilicon rod. The etchant is potentiallyharmful and must be handled in an acid exhaust fumehood with utmost care at all times. Hydrofluoric acidsolutions are particularly hazardous. All precautionsnormally used with these acids should be strictlyobserved. They should not be used by anyone who isnot familiar with the specific preventative measures andfirst aid treatments given in the appropriate MaterialSafety Data Sheet.9.3 The crystal growth furnace uses radio frequency(RF) power (generator and coil) to supply power formelting silicon, about 1400°C. The user must betrained in working with electrical connections, pressu-rized gas lines, RF fields, and hot parts.9.4 The molten silicon in the melt zone emits a brightlight and operators may be exposed to this light forseveral hours. This exposure requires the use of eyeprotection. 10 Sampling10.1 The cores shall contain material representative ofthe growth process used to form the polysilicon rod.The cores are intended to be representative of thepolysilicon rod being sampled.10.2 A number of cores can be taken at differentlocations of the polysilicon rod to satisfy varioussample plans. Samples taken should cover both ends ofthe rod. Two typical sampling methods are taking coresparallel to the filament and taking cores perpendicularto the filament as shown in Figures 1 and 2. Theparallel core system is described in Section 10.2.1. Theperpendicular core system is described in Section10.2.2. Figure 1 Figure 2Parallel Coring Location Perpendicular Coring Locations

SEMI MF1723-1104 © SEMI 20045 10.2.1 Parallel Cores  As shown in Figure 1, coresare taken parallel to the filament at a minimum lengthof 100 mm and a diameter of 20 mm. Two differentcores, a filament core and a growth layer core, arerequired to calculate the total polysilicon rod impuritycontent.10.2.1.1 Parallel Filament Cores  Cores includingthe filament are representative of the filament and theinitial deposition layer on the filament. These cores arefloat zoned, analyzed, and the values combined with thegrowth layer cores to calculate a total value.10.2.1.2 Parallel Growth Layer Cores  Cores notincluding the filament, only the growth layer, arerepresentative of the poly deposited onto the filament.These cores are float-zoned, analyzed, and the valuescombined with the filament core values to calculate atotal value.10.2.1.3 Parallel Core Sampling Locations10.2.1.3.1 Radial Location  Cores can be takenacross the entire rod diameter to check radial uniformityof the deposition layer. Since the outer surface maycontain surface cracks or surface roughness, the outer 5mm should not be sampled.10.2.1.3.2 Axial Location  For an entire U-rod ofpolysilicon, cores usually are taken from the shortbridging section or from a region on the long rod within50 mm of either end, but may be taken at any locationto check axial uniformity of deposition.10.2.2 Perpendicular Cores  As shown in Figure 2,20-mm diameter cores are taken through the diameterof the polysilicon rod with length same as the diameterof the poly rod. Cores are taken so that the filamentand material from all parts of the deposition layer areincluded. For accurate calculation of the impurities atvarious growth layers, at least one end of the perpen-dicular core should include the outer skin layer. Forrods less than 60-mm diameter, it is not possible toproduce single crystal ingots of sufficient zone lengthfor accurate analysis. In this case, cores parallel to thefilament are taken for analysis.10.2.2.1 Perpendicular Growth Layer Cores  Coreswithout the intersected filament, as shown in Figure 2,can be zoned and analyzed to determine the impuritiesin the deposition layer. To find the impurities in thetotal rod, the filament must be analyzed separately andcombined with the growth layer results. Values arecalculated using the formulas for parallel cores.10.2.2.2 Perpendicular Core Sampling Location For an entire U-rod of polysilicon, cores usually aretaken from the short bridging section, or from a regionon the long rod within 50 mm of either end. Cores may be taken at any location to check axial uniformity ofdeposition, but are not taken at the bend of the U-rod,due to stresses in this area.10.3 Filament Analysis  If a parallel or perpendicularfilament core can not be taken, the filament may beanalyzed separately, then combined with the growthlayer analysis. For filaments that are single crystal, ornearly single crystal, wafers can be cut, prepared, andanalyzed by spectrophotometric techniques described inSEMI MF1389, SEMI MF1391, and SEMI MF1630. 11 Reference Specimens11.1 Use polysilicon control rods to monitor the purityof the core preparation techniques, acid etch bath, andzoning conditions. Drill a large number of depositionlayer cores, 20-mm diameter by 100-mm length frompolysilicon rods having a uniform deposition layer.Select control rods with low impurity levels, such asacceptor/donor values about 0.01 ppba and carbonvalues about 0.05 ppma to allow the early detection oftrace impurities from interference sources. After re-peated analysis, assign values for donor, acceptor, andcarbon concentrations. Then etch, zone, and analyzethese control rods on a periodic basis to monitor purityof the sample preparation, etching, and zoning pro-cesses.11.2 Control chart values for the acceptor, donor, andcarbon concentrations from the control rods usingstandard statistical process-control techniques andstatistical rules to determine if the current values are incontrol. If these values exceed the statistical limits,make corrections and repeat the analysis. 12 Procedure12.1 Seed Preparation12.1.1 Prepare round or rectangular seeds by coredrilling, cutting, or crystal pulling from high purity floatzone ingots. Use seed material of zero dislocationdensity with acceptor content less than 0.05 ppba, donorcontent less than 0.05 ppba, and carbon content lessthan 0.1 ppma.12.1.2 Select a high purity single crystal seed, 3 mm to5 mm in diameter, for initiation of float zone crystalgrowth. Orient the seed 111 within 0.5°.12.1.3 Clean, acid etch, rinse and dry the seed to thesame procedure, using the same equipment describedfor core samples. To avoid surface contamination, useseeds within 36 h after etching, or store them in amanner to prevent contamination.

When the proper temperatures andwater flows are achieved, place the core samples intoclean etch boats and etch, rinse, and dry the cores. Usethe HNO 3-HF acid etching mixture, etching at least twocycles, to remove a minimum of 100 m from thesurface of the core sample. This is necessary in order toremove surface damage caused by the coring process.Other acid etch mixtures can be used, but must beevaluated and controlled to ensure effectiveness andavoid impurity interferences.12.2.3 After etching, float zone cores as soon aspossible to reduce the probability of contamination.Re-etch cores if the maximum holding period isexceeded. To extend the holding period, seal the coresin a suitably clean material and store in a clean roomenvironment.12.3 Preparation of Apparatus12.3.1 Clean the core drilling apparatus to preventcontamination of the core sample.12.3.2 Clean the etch bench and check the DI rinsewater purity, temperature, total organic carbon, andresistivity.12.3.3 Clean the float zone chamber. Using the stain-less steel wire brush, scrub the walls of the chamber toloosen silicon deposits and remove the loose particleswith the vacuum cleaner. Wipe the walls, holders, andcoil with clean room wipes soaked with a high puritysolvent. Inspect cooling water reservoir, water flow,water temperature, coil and preheater connections,shaft, coil feedthroughs, door seals, hose connections,travel stops, and rotations.12.3.4 Carry out major cleaning, including acidcleaning of coil and associated parts, and changing ofseals on a periodic basis. After cleaning, argon drying,and vacuum pumping, perform a chamber and preheaterbakeout of at least 15 min.12.4 Ingot Growth12.4.1 Place the core samples and seed in the furnacechamber so that both hang plumb and are centered andaligned with the vertical axis of rotation.12.4.2 Remove air from the chamber with a series ofevacuation and argon purge cycles. Fill the chamberwith argon and continue the argon purge throughout thegrowth cycle, maintaining a positive pressure of argonin the chamber. 12.4.3 Position the seed end of the core sample in thecoil, and the preheater close to the seed end of the core.Adjust the preheater power to make the initial inductioncoupling of the preheater and sample, and heat until thesample begins to glow, about 600 to 700°C. Move thepreheater away from the sample and move the coresample close to the coil opening to establish a moltenzone controlled by power to the coil.12.4.4 After a small molten zone has been establishedat the seed end, move the seed vertically until it touchesthe molten zone. Withdraw the seed to form a conicalmelt, making sure the seed has melted in, and begin thenecking phase in order to form a zero dislocationcrystal.12.4.5 Adjust top and bottom travel and rotation ratesto complete the necking phase, check for the three-growth facet lines to ensure the ingot is single crystal,and adjust travel and power level to form the finaldiameter of the ingot. Adjust the travel and rotationsand grow a single crystal zero dislocation ingot.12.4.6 When the desired ingot length has been attained,pull the ingot from the melt, making sure the ingot andmelt separate without freezing. After separation,reduce power, stop all travels and rotation, turn offpower, and allow to cool.12.5 Ingot Evaluation12.5.1 Visual Examination  Examine the ingotvisually for uniformity of diameter, continuousuniform-growth facet line, and color, to determinewhether the ingot is zero dislocation single crystal andwhether oxide deposits are present as a result of airleaks.12.5.2 Structural and Electrical Examination12.5.2.1 Determine crystallographic orientation in ac-cordance with SEMI MF26 on a sampling basis toconfirm the visual examination.12.5.2.2 Determine the crystallographic perfection ofthe grown ingot in accordance with SEMI MF1725 on asampling basis to confirm the visual examination.12.5.2.3 Test for uniform distribution ofacceptor/donor impurities by plotting a resistivityprofile along the length of the ingot in accordance withSEMI MF397. Note that resistivity values should varyalong the length consistent with the net acceptor/donorvalues measured at the various points and that sharpchanges in the profile indicate point contamination ornonuniformity of the sample deposition layer.12.6 Ingot Sampling12.6.1 After the ingot is inspected for crystallographicperfection, appearance, and uniformity, and judged to
