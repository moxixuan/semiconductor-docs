SEMI D27-1000 © SEMI 20001 SEMI D27-1000GUIDE FOR FLAT PANEL DISPLAY EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONINTERFACES This guide was technically approved by the Global Flat Panel Display Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Flat Panel Display Committee. Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on August 28, 2000. Initially available at www.semi.org August2000; to be published October 2000. 1 Purpose1.1 This is a guide for implementi ng equipmentcommunication features for successful integration andautomation in a flat panel display manufacturingfacility. 2 Scope2.1 This guide includes references to other SEMIstandards. It also includes definitions and explanationsspecific to FPD equipment automation.2.2 The scope of this guide is limi ted to equipmentcommunication features that interface with factoryautomation systems.2.3 This guide does not reference physical or electricalinterfaces, except to the extent necessary to implementthe features described. For example, a serial data cableconnector could be specified to have 9 pins or 25 pins.2.4 This guide may not be applica ble to all types ofFPD equipment. It only applies to those for which adirect data communication interface will beimplemented between the equipment and the factoryautomation systems.2.5 This guide does not address al l software standardsthat may be applicable, but addresses a subset that isnecessary for effective integration and automation.2.6 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 The other SEMI standards refe rred to in thisdocument have been carefully reviewed forapplicability to FPD manufacturing. However, whenreferring to other SEMI standards used in thisspecification, the reader should allow for some editorialexceptions in order to apply the specification to FPDequipment. For example, if another SEMI specificationreferenced here uses the term wafer, the reader canassume that this also applies to FPD substrates, andlikewise with silicon and glass or plastic. These minor differences in no way impact the interpretation orimplementation of those standards in FPDmanufacturing equipment and factory systems.3.2 This guide is not an all-inclusi ve list of applicablestandards, but is a starting point for definingrequirements of these equipment automation functions,and a guideline for implementation. 4 Referenced StandardsNOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E4  SEMI Equipment CommunicationsStandard 1 Message Transfer (SECS-I)SEMI E5  SEMI Equipment CommunicationsStandard 2 Message Content (SECS-II)SEMI E23  Specification for Cassette TransferParallel I/O InterfaceSEMI E30  Generic Model for Communications andControl of SEMI Equipment (GEM)SEMI E37  High-Speed SECS Message Services(HSMS), Generic ServicesSEMI E37.1  High-Speed SECS Message Services,Single-Session Mode (HSMS-SS)SEMI E84  Specification for Enhanced CarrierHandoff Parallel I/O 5 Terminology5.1 The following define some des criptive terms thatcan be used to refer to systems that meet therequirements of the standards referenced herein.5.1.1 SECS Compliant  This term is often used todescribe systems which comply completely with boththe SEMI E4 (SECS-I) and SEMI E5 (SECS-II)standards. However, it is more appropriate to identifythe system as SECS-I Compliant and/or SECS-IIcompliant. This distinction is important because SECS-II can be implemented independently from SECS-I. Theterm SECS Compliant is ambiguous, but commonlyused. It is suggested that the following terms be used

&lt;!-- Page 5 --&gt;

SEMI D27-1000 © SEMI 2000 2 instead to describe the equipment and hostcommunication interface.5.1.2 SECS-I Compliant  This term is used toidentify a system that complies completely with SEMIE4.5.1.3 SECS-II Compliant  This ter m is used toidentify a system that complies completely with SEMIE5.5.1.4 HSMS Compliant  This term is used todescribe systems which comply with SEMI E37(HSMS) and either SEMI E37.1 (HSMS-SS) or SEMIE37.2 (HSMS-GS) or both. However, it is moreappropriate to identify the system as either HSMS-SSCompliant or HSMS-GS Compliant, since they bothimply compliance with SEMI E37, and the user mustknow exactly which of the two is supported. The termHSMS Compliant is ambiguous, but commonly used.5.1.5 HSMS-SS Compliant  This t erm is used toidentify a system that complies completely with SEMIE37 and SEMI E37.1. This protocol has been adoptedfor use in FPD.5.1.6 HSMS-GS Compliant  This term is used toidentify a system that complies completely with SEMIE37 and SEMI E37.2.5.1.7 GEM  Generic Equipment M odel as defined inSEMI E30.5.1.8 GEM Compliant  This term is defined inSEMI E30.5.1.9 Fully GEM Capable  This te rm is defined inSEMI E30.5.1.10 System  Either manufacturin g equipment orfactory host. 6 Data Transfer6.1 For optimum compatibility, sy stems supporting theautomation capabilities described herein should supportall requirements defined for at least one of thefollowing SEMI protocol standards:6.1.1 SEMI E4 (SECS-I)6.1.2 SEMI E37.1 (HSMS-SS). Not e that this requiresimplementation of SEMI E37.6.1.2.1 HSMS-SS compliant interface s are preferredfor FPD manufacturing because of its performance andlogistical advantages, and because it allows otherprotocols to operate on the same connectionsimultaneously.6.1.2.2 However, SECS-I interfaces a re acceptable insystems where the performance of a serial interface issufficient. Since many off-the-shelf component software implementations support both protocols, it isrelatively easy to design systems which can beconfigured to support either. 7 Data Format7.1 The system should support all minimumrequirements of SEMI E5 (SECS-II). Although moremodern data communication specifications areavailable (e.g. HTML), SECS-II has unique aspectswhich are valuable in microelectronics manufacturing.Also, there are many available off-the-shelf softwarepackages which provide the SECS-II feature set.7.2 Furthermore, for maximum co mpatibility andreliability, the implementation of any optional SEMI E5objects (data items, variable items, messages, etc.) onthe system should meet the requirements of SEMI E5.For example, if an FPD system implements the S7,F3message, it must do so in compliance with SEMI E5 tobe considered SECS-II Compliant. It is possible toimplement user-defined SECS-II messages, and it isallowed by SEMI E5.7.3 However, it is usually unneces sary to use suchcustom SECS-II messages. Complicated scenarios suchas production sequence control, inline production,consumable management, and material handling can allbe implemented using standard SECS-II messages.Many SECS-II messages are designed to be verygeneric and very flexible such as the Remote Commandmessage (S2F41 or S2F49) which can contain anynumber of parameters of any type in any format. Manyof the basic SECS-II data items such as variables canalso take on any type of value in any format.7.4 User-defined data items and m essages are moredifficult to integrate into FPD factory automationsystems and should be avoided. 8 GEM and SEM8.1 Generic Equipment Model (GE M)8.1.1 Any reference to the term GE M (GenericEquipment Model) with respect to FPD manufacturingequipment will be construed as a reference to SEMIE30. The system provider should ensure that this termis used only for those systems which rigidly adhere toSEMI E30. End-users will make certain assumptionsabout the capabilities of GEM systems based on therequirements of SEMI E30.8.1.2 SEMI E30 is applicable to FPD manufacturingequipment. FPD equipment suppliers may choose toimplement GEM. In order for FPD equipment to beGEM Compliant or Fully GEM Capable, it mustmeet the requirements of SEMI E30 without exception.However, it may not be necessary to implement certain

&lt;!-- Page 6 --&gt;

SEMI D27-1000 © SEMI 20003 optional GEM capabilities for effective FPDautomation.8.1.3 The implementation of SEMI E30, or lackthereof, is usually a point of much negotiation betweenequipment supplier and end-user. SEMI E30 provides auseful template for identifying which capabilities are tobe provided and which are not. The GEM ComplianceStatement document should be provided by theequipment supplier to describe the capabilities of theinterface, whether or not the system is GEM Compliant.8.1.4 GEM is not applicable to host systems, but hostsystems must implement a compatible set of features towork effectively with GEM equipment.8.2 Specific Equipment Model (SE M)8.2.1 The concept of a Specific Equ ipment Model,which requires compliance with SEMI E30 (GEM),could be applied to FPD equipment as well. Thisdocument does not address SEMs. The user may wishto review the published SEM standards and determinetheir applicability in an FPD implementation. 9 Interfaces to Material Tran sfer Systems9.1 Carrier Transfer Parallel I/O Interfaces9.1.1 Material handling systems are critical for manyFPD manufacturing operations. But, not all equipmentsupport the automated transfer of material to and fromthe equipment. This section only applies to systems,which support automated carrier transfer.9.1.2 For compatibility with many a utomated materialhandling systems on the factory floor, FPD equipmentshould support all requirements for at least one of thefollowing SEMI carrier transfer parallel I/O standards:9.1.2.1 SEMI E23 (Cassette Transfer Parallel I/OInterface)  Note that the diagram in SEMI E23showing placement of the photo-coupled I/O interfacewith respect to the carrier stage (CS) shows specific CSsize measurements. However, this is just an exampleand not a requirement of SEMI E23. The requirement isthat the photo sensor must be on the front edge of theCS and its center aligned with the center of the CS. Thisapplies to a CS of any size.9.1.2.2 SEMI E84 (Enhanced Carrier HandoffParallel I/O Interface)  Note that SEMI E84references SEMI E1.9, SEMI E15, SEMI E15.1, SEMIE47.1, and SEMI E64 which are semiconductor specificstandards and not applicable to FPD. However, none ofthe requirements in these documents are prerequisitesfor implementing SEMI E84. SEMI E84 is applicableto FPD and can be implemented independently.

SEMI D31-1102 © SEMI 20021 SEMI D31-1102DEFINITION OF MEASUREMENT INDEX (SEMU) FOR LUMINANCEMURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION This definition was technically approved by the Global Flat Panel Display Committee and is the directresponsibility of the Japan Flat Panel Display Committee. Current edition approved by the Japan RegionalStandards Committee on July 19, 2002. Initially available at www.semi.org October 2002; to be publishedNovember 2002. 1 Purpose1.1 This standard will define the index of measurementfor mura in FPD image quality inspection.1.2 Conventionally, inspection of FPD image qualityhas been sensory, mainly conducted via the human eye,and among the items detected, there has been nocommon standard for mura and other associateddefects. For this reason, when panel makers and theirusers who conduct business with a fixed quality levelset a mura acceptance level, limit samples are used asnecessary.1.3 Operational problems with limit samples include: Level of mura cannot be determined withoutviewing the sample. Due to this, it is not possibleto express the level via written documentation ortelephone. The sample settings are subjectively decided by thesetter, and lack objectivity. It is difficult to setup and maintain a consistentsample level at multiple locations.1.4 Etc.  Above all, in a market complicated bymultiple panel makers and multiple users, wherepresently there is no fixed standard for expressing muralevel, we have to say that it is extremely difficult toensure a fixed level for panel quality.1.5 In this standard, using ergonomics approach, wewill investigate the human eyes sensitivity regardingmura, and by expressing the relation between mura areaand contrast, propose an index to express the level ofmura. 2 Scope2.1 This standard is applicable to FPD (Flat PanelDisplays) excluding CRT and HMD (Head MountDisplays). The display sizes targeted are typically fromType 8 (8" (20.3 cm) diagonal) to Type 30 (30" (76.2cm) diagonal).2.2 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 In the first edition of this standard, the target ofmeasurement, mura, is limited as below.3.1.1 Line defects narrower than 300 m and pixel dotdefects are not the subject of this standard.3.1.2 Mura background display is limited tomonochrome displays/intermediate gray scale level;RGB, etc. color background and L0/L63 backgroundare not the subject of this standard. 4 Referenced StandardsNone.5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 Gray Scale  Gray scale on image display.

SEMI D31-1102 © SEMI 2002 2 6 Semu Definition6.1 Under specific conditions, the below regressiverelationship can be seen between area and contrast forHuman Mura JND. (Refer to Related Information.)Cjnd = F(Sjnd)= 1.97/Sjnd 0.33 + 0.72Cjnd: Contrast of mura at JND (Unit: % relative tobackground = 100%)Sjnd: Area of mura at above contrast (Units: mm2)6.1.1 In the above equation, contrast at JND isinversely proportional to area raised to the 0.33 power.In short, it indicates that as mura area gets smaller, onlydarker muras can be sensed.6.2 For the subject mura, the mura level, Semu, can becalculated using the below formula.Semu = |Cx| / Cjnd= |Cx| / F(Sx)= |Cx| /(1.97/Sx0.33 + 0.72)Cx: Average contrast of mura being measured(Unit: % relative to background = 100%)Sx: Surface area of mura being measured (Units:mm2 )7 Notation7.1 Semu is a comparison ratio between contrast of themeasurement target and contrast in a JND, and thus hasno unit.7.2 It is recommended that significant digits bedisplayed to one decimal place.NOTE 1: Notation uses this following methodology.NotationExample 1: The level of JND mura in this study is Semu =1.0. Notation Example 2: The level of this mura is Semu 2.5. 8 Test Methods8.1 Comparative Measurement and DirectMeasurement  The two methods for determiningSemu levels on panels are comparative measurementand direct measurement.8.1.1 Comparative Measurement8.1.1.1 The comparative measurement method involvesa panel and software which can simulate Semu level, towhich a person compares a mura on an actual panel,making adjustments, until a level which appears similaris determined. This is a method that can be used in theactual production site easily using the Semu simulationpanel as the variable level limit sample.8.1.2 Direct Measurement8.1.2.1 The direct measurement method captures theactual panel with a CCD camera, or the like, and is a method of measuring the Semu level of the murasection, making it possible to directly determine theSemu from the area and contrast of the mura sectionthat is captured.8.2 Measurement Equipment8.2.1 Semu measurement consists of measurement ofthe area of mura on the display surface and contrastmeasurement, and needs to be appropriately calibrated.8.3 Measurement Environment8.3.1 Semu measurement will be conducted in adarkroom environment.8.4 Display Conditions8.4.1 Background luminance for Semu measurementshall be 50 ± 10 cd/m2.8.5 Contrast Measurement8.5.1 The average contrast of the mura section shall bemeasured, and the contrast ratio of the mura section willexpressed as a percentage, for when the background =100%. 9 Related Documents9.1 Experiment Overview for Calculation ofMeasurement Index for Mura in FPD Image QualityInspection.

SEMI D31-1102 © SEMI 20023 RELATED INFORMATION 1EXPERIMENT OUTLINE FOR CALCULATION OF MEASUREMENTINDEX FOR LUMINANCE MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION NOTE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI D31. This related information was approved forpublication by full letter ballot procedures on July 19, 2002. R1-1 PurposeR1-1.1 It has been reported that under the range ofcertain conditions, a basic expression of FPD muraquality level can be made, using their size andcontrast\[1\] . Here, recreating those experiments, weverified their reproducibility, conducting theexperiment with a goal of calculating a measurementindex for luminance mura for standardization. R1-2 Experiment MethodR1-2.1 Experiment EquipmentR1-2.1.1 The experiment utilized a 14.1 inch, 1024 X768 pixel backlit TFT/LCD. As there was a need todisplay low contrast luminance muras, it was reworkedto display 256 gradations in a 43 cd/m2 ~ 54 cd/m2range. A program capable of displaying rectangularand round muras as desired was created, and the muraswere displayed in the center of the prepared LCD. Thesubjects could freely adjust the luminance of thedisplayed luminance muras using a handheld ten-keypad.R1-2.2 Experiment ConditionsR1-2.2.1 21 types of muras were used. These werefour round types (diameter:7, 25, 55, 305 pixels) and 17rectangular types (311, 1531, 2401, 4801, 312,1532, 2402, 313, 1533, 2403, 3116, 6935,14017, 24010, 131, 1153, 1240). Observationconditions were a viewing distance of 500 mm, andview angle normal to the center of the LCD. Theexperiment room was a darkroom, and the backgroundluminance of the luminance mura was 48 cd/m2.R1-2.3 Subjects/Experiment ProcedureR1-2.3.1 The subjects for the experiment were 16adults, with no eye disease and with near visionstrength (50 cm) of 1.2 or greater for both eyes. Of the16 subjects, there was an Expert group of 8 (7 male, 1female, average age 40 years), consisting of engineersfrom LCD makers, who regularly conduct murainspections and analysis. The remaining 8 subjects (6males, 2 females, average age 21) were collegestudents, a Novice group who were conductingluminance mura evaluation for the first time. Using theten-key pad, the subjects adjusted the luminance ofmura, to a point where mura can just no longer be detected (referred to as jnd: just noticeabledifference below) and to a point where mura canclearly be detected (referred to as distinct below),recording the contrasts at these times. Muras brighterthan the background and lighter than the backgroundwere both targeted. R1-3 Experiment ResultsR1-3.1 The following matters became clear from theexperiment. The larger the area of the mura, the smaller jndcontrast (C jnd) became. (Muras are more visibleas area becomes larger) Muras with a width of one pixel, compared to othermuras, require nearly 1.5 to 2 times the contrast.(Muras with a width of one pixel are difficult todetect) Comparing the distribution between the subjects,there was no difference between the Expert andNovice groups for jnd contrast (C jnd) Compared to the Expert group, the Novice grouphad a larger distribution for distinct contrast.R1-3.2 The relation between mura area and jndcontrast showed the same trend as in past experience\[1\] ,and the quality of reproducibility was confirmed.Therefore at this point, for the sake of standardization,we examined the function for mura area, and triedlinear regression for it with jnd contrast. Figure 1 shows the results. When the horizontal axis is 33.01S(S is mura area in mm2 units), and the vertical axis is atcontrast, the bold line shows a strong correlationcoefficient, understood through linear regression.R1-3.3 This bold line shows the relation between muraarea and contrast at the point where the mura becomesjust not detectable (jnd), and if area is determined, thenjnd contrast (C jnd) can be figured out. In Figure 1, is a mura with a width of one pixel, and  representsother muras (not one pixel wide) respectivelyrepresenting the averages of the 16 subjects. As notedabove in 2), a mura with a width of one pixel tends tobe slightly different, which is why they were handledseparately. Also considering past experiment results,when viewing distance is 500mm, the 0.3mm level

Equation 1 R1-3.4 The criteria for standardization, jnd, isdetermined by the C jnd straight line, but we alsopropose, based on this criteria, quality levels for othervisible muras. Figure 1 shows straight lines made up of2.0 jnd and 3.0 jnd.  is distinct contrast for theExpert group, but in cases besides 1-pixel wide muras,it can be understood to be distributed slightly above the2.0 jnd straight line.R1-3.5 This indicates that the straight-line relationshipof Figure 1 is not only jnd level, but also consists of visible contrast level. Accordingly, with the bold linejnd as a standard, mura quality level can be expressedby n in n x jnd. From the experiment results this time,from 3.0 being a level slightly above distinct, it can bethought that it is desirable to operate using a range oflevels 1.0 to 3.0. R1-4 SummaryR1-4.1 A proposal was made regarding thequantization of FPD luminance mura. The quality levelof a mura can be expressed as a function between muraarea and contrast, using the contrast at the jnd point ascriteria. By using this method, even if mura area,shape, or contrast is different, we can now calculatesimilar quality level jnd.

SEMI D32-0303 © SEMI 20031 SEMI D32-0303SPECIFICATION FOR IMPROVED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FORGLASS FPD SUBSTRATES THROUGH ORIENTATION CORNERUNIFICATION This specification was technically approved by the Global FPD Materials and Components Committee and isthe direct responsibility of the Japanese FPD Materials and Components Committee. Current editionapproved by the Japanese Regional Standards Committee on January 10, 2003. Initially available atwww.semi.org January 2003; to be published March 2003. 1 Purpose1.1 This specification provides the location,dimensions, and message size of the marking symbolthat consists of a two-dimensional code symbol andrelated alpha numeric characters (capable of being readvisually through the reader camera and display) and islocated outside of the quality area of glass flat paneldisplay (FPD) substrate.1.2 The marking symbol in this specification allows theinclusion of identification information for eachindividual substrate together with the additionalinformation previously provided by various orientationcorner (OC) cut shapes.1.3 Thus, this specification allows suppliers of glasssubstrates for FPDs to simplify substrate informationmanagement by marking such information in onelocation around the OC on the substrate, beforeshipping. In addition, use of this marking symbol willfacilitate the future elimination of the numerous typesof OC cut shapes presently in use.1.4 The marking symbol covered by this specificationis intended for use by suppliers and purchasers of glasssubstrates for FPDs. 2 Scope2.1 This specification provides for a standardized OClocation in support of future unification of the OC cutshape as well as location. When this is done, theprovisional nature of the specification can be removed.2.2 This specification covers the content, dimensions,and surface positioning of the marking symbol locatedoutside of the quality area of glass substrates for FPDuse.2.2.1 This marking symbol is marked in a manner andlocation to avoid affecting the user patterning process.2.2.2 Although this specification does not specify themarking technique to be employed when complyingwith its requirements, it is assumed that the markingsymbol will be obtained by laser marking individualdots. 2.3 Marking symbols are applicable across all stages ofFPD processing, from virgin substrates to fullypatterned substrates. The format and algorithm for theData Matrix code is based on two-dimensionalsymbology specified in ISO/IEC 16022.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Since the symbol is marked in a region of thesubstrate outside of the quality area, it is not availablefor use after this area is cut off.3.2 Since only a single symbol is marked on eachsubstrate, the marking symbol is not directly applicablefor management of individual panels in multi-paneldisplays. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 ISO/IEC Standard1 ISO/IEC 16022  International Symbology Specifica-tion  Data MatrixNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Terms relating to the Data Matrix code symbolcharacteristics are defined in ISO/IEC 16022.5.2 Definitions of terms relating to alphanumericcharacters are as follows:5.2.1 character separation  the horizontal distancebetween the adjacent boundaries of any two adjacentcharacters. 1 International Organization for Standardization, ISO CentralSecretariat, 1, rue de Varemb, Case postale 56, CH-1211 Geneva 20,Switzerland.

SEMI D33-0703 © SEMI 20031 SEMI D33-0703MEASURING METHOD OF OPTICAL CHARACTERISTICS FORBACKLIGHT UNIT This method was technically approved by the Global Flat Panel Display Committee and is the directresponsibility of the Japanese FPD Materials and Components Committee. Current edition approved by theJapanese Regional Standards Committee on April 28, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org May 2003;to be published July 2003. 1 Purpose1.1 The electro optical characteristics of backlight unit(BLU) have a great influence on the characteristics ofLCD like uniformity, luminance and chromaticity etc.There are many measurement methods for BLU ofelectro optical characteristics. It is so different that themeasurement method for BLU in each company (e.g.:the testing position, test condition, equipment conceptetc.). Therefore, this standard will present the generalmeasurement method. 2 Scope2.1 This standard is applicable to BLU for LiquidCrystal Display (LCD) and the measurement includesonly the optical area. The other areas (Electriccharacteristics, Reliability, and so forth) are dealt withby other SEMI standards.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This standard does not include the test of each BLUcomponent such as: light guide panel, optical film, ColdCathode Fluorescent Lamp (CCFL), filmcharacteristics, and etc. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 Other StandardsFlat Panel Display Measurement Standard, VESAFPDM 2.0, June 2001.Commission Internationale de lEclairage (CIE),Colorimetry of Self-Luminous Displays-ABibliography, CIE Publication No. 87, 1990.Commission Internationale de lEclairage (CIE),Colorimetry, CIE Publication No. 15.2, 1986.NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 TerminologyNone.6 The Optical Measurement Method6.1 The test result of BLU can vary because of theenvironment and measurement conditions. Therefore,the measurement environment and conditions need tobe determined.6.2 Measurement Setup6.2.1 Environment conditions: Temperature: 25 ± 2C Humidity: 65 ± 20% RH Illumination of surrounding: dark room below 10lux Air flow: no wind6.2.2 Measurement Conditions6.2.2.1 The measuring distance is suitable for500 ± 50 mm at field aperture 1 and the viewingdirection of all tests are 90 ± 1. This distance isapplied for all measurements in this standard. 90±1 500±50mm Backlight Unit LMD Figure 1The Measuring Configuration for MeasuringOptical Characteristics of BLU 6.2.2.2 Electrical conditions for driving are the typicallamp current and typical operating frequency.

SEMI D33-0703 © SEMI 2003 2 6.2.3 Measuring Equipment6.2.3.1 Instrument for Driving of BLU6.2.3.1.1 In this standard a DC power supply is neededand an inverter for BLU driving of electro-optical test.It is required that the DC-power supply has the range ofthe output voltage between 0 to 30V and has the rangeof the output current between 0 to 8A.6.2.3.2 Instrument For Optical Measurement6.2.3.2.1 In this standard, spectroradiometer is neededfor optical test. Spectroradiometer is more adequatethan a filter photometer for BLU color measurementand it can use filter photometer and spectroradiometerfor luminance measurement.6.2.4 Warm-Up Time6.2.4.1 Warm-up time is the period from power-on tosaturation of the light intensity. The opticalmeasurement needs 15 to 30 minutes for a moreaccurate measurement in case of luminance andluminance uniformity. Figure 2The Warm-Up Time of BLU 6.2.5 Others6.2.5.1 It is recommended that the user record theenvironment and condition such as: temperature,humidity, illumination of surrounding, testing distance,warm-up time, lamp current, etc.6.3 Measurement Items6.3.1 The following measurement items arerecommended for BLU, but these items depend on userrequirements if they are specified.6.3.2 Luminance6.3.2.1 It is the surface luminance that is detected in alltest areas. Luminance should be expressed in a unitsuch as candelas per meter squared \[cd/m2 \]. Thisluminance is the value measured at one center point oraverage value at several testing points. Generally, the lamp current of BLU should be set to typical lampcurrent. If the lamp current value has fluctuation state,the user should wait by stable state. The measurementsare performed in the dark room under standardmeasuring conditions and design viewing direction.6.3.3 Luminance Uniformity6.3.3.1 Luminance uniformity is a measure of how wellthe luminance remains constant over the surface of theactive area and it is a closely related measurement toluminance itself. Backlights are particularly liable tohave the non-uniformity characteristics. The measuringmethod is similar to the luminance measuring method.In this measurement, it is important to determine thetesting position. The determination of the testingposition occur some different testing result. In thisstandard, we calculate the uniformity with the ratio ofmax luminance and min luminance level. The simpleformulas are below. There are two formulas foruniformity. These formulas explain the non-uniformityconcept, but they very popular with related industry. Measuring position in luminance uniformity formula: 100)((%)maxminmax =LLLUniformity LLratioUniformityminmax)( = NOTE 1: For example, if the maximum luminance is100 cd/m2 and the minimum luminance is 80 cd/m2 theUniformity (%) is 20%. And the uniformity (ratio) is 1.25.

The lamp starts to discharge afterthe voltage reaches a certain value. Furthermore,increase the voltage gradually (slide-up) and measurethe potential difference between the lamp ends(electrodes) as a stable discharge voltage when a maindischarge starts.9.1.2 Measurement of Lamp Current  Adjust theoutput voltage of power supply unit to gain a specifiedlamp current. Measure the lamp current at GNDterminal when it becomes stable at a specified value.Record the preset voltage of the power supply as well.(Refer to Figure 1 or Figure 2.)9.1.3 Measurement of Lamp Voltage  Measure thepotential difference between both ends (electrodes) of alamp as a lamp voltage when the lamp current becomesstable at a specified lamp current. If the lamp current isaffected when a probe is connected, adjust the lampcurrent to make it a specified lamp current. Measurethe lamp current after it becomes stable.9.1.4 Lamp Wattage  It is defined as a product oflamp current, lamp voltage and power factor(W = VL  IL  cos) and expressed as a referencevalue. When the phase difference between the lampcurrent and lamp voltage can be ignored and if suchsituation is specified, the product of the lamp current and lamp voltage (W = VL  IL) may be expressed as areference value.9.2 Measurement of Optical Characteristics9.2.1 Point of Measurement  The point is the sidesurface of a lamp, which is within the range of viewingangle (black circle) of a measuring instrument. The areaof measurement is the central part of the lamp. Thepoint of measurement shall be so small relatively to theinner diameter of the lamp that the dislocation of thepoint may not vary the luminance and chromaticity.The point of measurement is a cylindrical surface but itcould be regarded as a plain surface due to thesmallness. (See Figure 5.) The dispersion due todislocation of a point of measurement is smaller withinthe range that is less than or equal to 50% of the innerdiameter. The luminance decreases in the other range.9.2.2 Distance of Measurement  The distance shallbe from a lamp surface to be measured to a light-receiving lens surface of a measuring instrument. Thesize of viewing angle varies according to adjustment byluminance meter and the distance of measurement, setthe distance to match the inner diameter mentionedabove. When measuring, the inner surface of the lampand the focal point shall be well matched (Figure 5). (Ifthe focal point of the luminance meter is displaced, theluminance and chromaticity values will not be indicatedcorrectly.)9.2.3 Timing of Measurement  Measure after theluminance seems stable at a specified lamp current(where the luminance fluctuation difference is within± 3% of the stable luminance, for example).

The highest luminance and stableluminance vary by the combination of ambient temperature and lamp current and the transitions vary as well. This isbased upon the fact that the CCFL luminance depends on temperature and the generated heat by lighting affects it.For this reason, the luminance varies until the lamp wall temperature becomes stable. Before the measurement, graspthe special rising property of luminance and set the timing of measurement of the stable luminance.9.2.4 Measurement of Luminance  Set a spectroradiometer or a colorimeter vertical to a side to be measured andmeasure according to the above-mentioned instruction of measurement.

SEMI D35-1103E © SEMI 20037 RELATED INFORMATION 1STARTING VOLTAGE OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP(CCFL) NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI D35 and was derived from Japan Backlight TF. R1-1 Phenomenon of CCFL DischargeStartingR1-1.1 Although the phenomenon of CCFL dischargestarting shows the similarity to that of low gas pressuredischarge starting, a high frequency lighting circuit(inverter) with approximately 30100 kHz is mostlyused to discharge and so it is affected by straycapacitance.R1-1.2 When the secondary voltage of inverter isstepping up from a sufficiently low voltage gradually,an emission area appears near the electrode connectedto higher voltage side. (See Figure R1-1 1st Phase).This means that the discharge starts between theelectrode and ground level of discharge circuit throughthe stray capacitance, and a spark after dark currenttakes place in the discharge space in the tube. In thedischarge, the other electrode is the tube wall (glass orfluorescent substance); the formation of dielectricbarrier discharge and the existence of the secondaryelectron supply system to the discharge space can beconsidered and thus the discharge seems sustainable.Therefore, the emission around the electrode is judgedto be the emission mainly by negative glow of glowdischarge. R1-2 From Discharge Starting to StableLighting ModeR1-2.1 After the discharge takes place near theelectrode and the secondary voltage of the inverterincreases gradually, the emission area near theelectrode grows longer accordingly. (See Figure R1-2.) This means that a positive column is generated byapplied voltage to have such the length as correspondsto the value of resistance based on the applied voltage.When the voltage is applied furthermore, the emissionarea (i.e. positive column) between two electrodes isgenerated finally. (See Figure R1-3 2 nd Phase.)However, if the tube is thin and long and the straycapacitance is relatively greater to the discharge circuit,the ratio of current that flows through the straycapacitance is still large at this phase. With theincrease of the inverter secondary voltage, the ratio of current that flows in the tube also increases and most ofthe current flows in the tube because the impedance ofdischarge path decreases on the contrary due tonegative characteristics of discharge. (See Figure R1-43 rd Phase.)R1-2.2 Each voltage applied at these three phases maybe called starting voltage at the first phase, or stabledischarge voltage or tube current at the third phase, forexample. Sometimes it could be hard to distinguish thesecond phase from the third phase. In addition, sincethe second phase is hardly observed by the tube designs(for the tube length, outer and inner diameters of tube,pressure and composition of filler gas, and peripheralmembers of tube), it looks as if the first phase shifted tothe third phase suddenly. This is because the straycapacitance is so big that the current cannot flow intothe tube, the discharge surges immediately after thecurrent flows into the tube, the impedance of thedischarge path decreases due to the negativecharacteristics and a large amount of current flows inthe tube all of a sudden.R1-2.3 From the viewpoint of discharge phenomenon,the voltages applied to the tube at the first and thirdphases are important. Especially the voltage applied atthe third phase should be noted practically. (Thevoltage applied at the second phase may be noted also.) R1-3 Cautions at Discharge StartingR1-3.1 At the discharge starting,  coefficient ofdischarge gas and  coefficient of electrode areinvolved. These coefficients contain the pressure ofdischarge gas (particle density) as a parameter.Especially when the mercury is filled in, the control ofambient temperature becomes very important becausethe mercury vapor (particle density) pressure changessensitively to the ambient temperature.R1-3.2 In addition, the lighting circuit is usually builtfor AC, the reduction of unnecessary stray capacitancebase on frequency shall be required. As the impact ofstray capacitance becomes greater especially when thetube is thin and long, sufficient consideration shall begiven.

SEMI D35-1103E © SEMI 20039 RELATED INFORMATION 2DARK CHARACTERISTICS OF DISCHARGE LAMP NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI D35 and was derived from Japan Backlight TF. R2-1 Start of Discharge LampR2-1.1 When a discharge lamp is activated, there mustbe electrons (initial electrons) in the discharge spacegenerally. In order to start up, it is necessary to applyan electric field, accelerate the initial electrons, exciteand ionize gaseous particles, and establish discharges(keep up discharges) in the discharge space. At thatmoment, the initial electrons are said to have relation tothe continuity of discharges at random, and thecombinations of the status of a lamp whenmanufactured, history of on/off of lighting, variousfactors of a discharge lamp, and lighting circuits areinvolved.R2-1.2 For these reasons, in terms of the start-up of adischarge lamp, initial electrons are required and thereare probability factors to be considered, and so thedischarge start-up time delay should be observedstatistically. R2-2 Dark Characteristics of Discharge Lampand RemedyR2-2.1 A discharge lamp usually starts up in a brightplace even when the initial electron source is notprovided especially. It is considered that this is becausethe external light gives energy to materials (gas,electrode, etc.) inside the discharge space to emitelectrons (photoelectrons) as an initial electron.However, in order to activate the discharge lamp in adark place, the photoelectron cannot be used. There areelectron sources such as natural radiation as the otherinitial electrons (cosmic rays and radian from the earth)but these are not enough to get initial electrons atpresent.R2-2.1.1 Since the initial electrons in the dischargespace in the darkness decrease greatly, the dischargestart-up time delay, which is from the voltage-appliedtime to the start-up time, tends to be salient. This isdefined as dark characteristics.R2-2.2 In order to start up a discharge lamp within alimited time, the method to supply positively initialelectrons in a discharge space is needed. For example,regarding a fluorescent lamp for ordinary lightingpurpose, its negative electrode is preheated before thestart-up. As a result, thermoelectrons, which are emittedfrom the emitter applied to the negative electrode, areused as an initial electron. For a glow starter,bremesstrahlung electrons by radioisotope (RI) built in the electrodes are employed. In addition, there areother methods such as applying high-voltage to supplyelectrons from the electrodes (field emission) andsupplying photoelectrons by turning on another lightsource (light bulb) located nearby a discharge lampbefore its start-up.R2-2.3 In terms of a discharge lamp used as an LCDbacklight, the conventional remedies have not beenutilized because it must have compact cathodeelectrodes, the RI is hardly used from theenvironmental view point, the output voltage for aninverter of high-frequency lighting circuit is limited,and the space is too small to built another light sourcein it. Thus, unique methods have been studied.Nowadays, the followings, such as exposing a metaloxide that emits exoelectrons\*1 in the discharge space,forming spattering layers\*2 on the wall near cathodeelectrodes by lighting a discharge lamp for a certaintime, and making a compound of materials with lowwork function\*3 into electrodes or placing it nearelectrodes, are performed. R2-3 Theory on Discharge Start-up Time DelayR2-3.1 The equation on the discharge start-up timedelay is as follows.  = 1/(PQ) ----------------------------- (1) where: average discharge start-up time delay (sec)P: percentage of one electron that discharges ( /particle)Q: number of initial electrons (particle/sec) R2-3.2 In Q factors mentioned before, such as thephotoelectrons\*4, thermoelectrons by external light,electrons emitted by field emission, electrons by naturalradiation, electrons by RI, and exoelectrons, and in Pfactors, such as the voltage applied to a discharge lamp,filler gas pressure, kind of gases, electrode materials,impact of residual impure gases and concessionaryshape of electrode, are involved.R2-3.3 Here, if a maximum value 1 is set to P byadjusting a discharge lamp and lighting circuit and if atleast one particle of electron per second exists in adischarge space,  will be 1 second. Usually P isconsidered to be the order of 10 -3. If  becomesapproximately 1 second, the initial electrons with orderof 10 3 particles per second will be required, and for 0.1

&lt;!-- Page 48 --&gt;

SEMI D35-1103E © SEMI 2003 10 second, approximately initial electrons with the order of10 4 particles per second will be required.R2-3.4 Measuring  under various conditions helps usto understand the dark characteristics and improve theremedies.\*1: When a material emits electrons, the energygreater than work function must be given toelectrons in the material but here the electronsare such energies emitted as low heat and light.The alpha alumina is said to emit exoelectronsand it is actually used as an initial electronsource for a cold cathode lamp. However, thedetails are still unknown. \*2: The mercury seems to interact with thespattering layer to create the exoelectronssource.\*3: The cesium (Cs) and the like with low workfunction applied to an electrode is used ascompound.\*4: The question still remains if photoelectrons canbe supplied when energy more than workfunction is given to a discharge lamp materialby external light (visible light). The electron byexternal light may be also considered as anexoelectron.

SEMI D35-1103E © SEMI 200311 RELATED INFORMATION 3PRECAUTIONS AGAINST MEASURING METHOD OF COLDFLUORESCENT LAMP NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI D35 and was derived from Japan Backlight TF. R3-1 IntroductionR3-1.1 The cold fluorescent lamp (CCFL) is turned onusually by using a compact DC/AC convertible powersupply called inverter. The CCFL has been developedwith top priorities such as a narrow diameter, space-saving shape and high brightness for its application andso the inverter has been requested to have a low profilespace-saving shape with high efficiency as well.R3-1.2 Understanding these requirements are satisfiedand the characteristics such as high voltage, highfrequency and micro current are compassable as trade-off in the CCFL, we should handle it with care. R3-2 Stray Capacitance and Leakage CurrentR3-2.1 Stray CapacitanceR3-2.1.1 The stray capacitance is defined as acharacteristic that behaves as if it had the electrostaticcapacity that system does not provide and its volume istoo unstable to be measured quantitatively(unintentional electrostatic capacity element). If aformula for electrostatic capacity between two parallelcopper wires is put into an equation, it will be nearlyexpressed as follows; C = Q/V = (0)/(log ((da)/a) ------ (1)whereC: electrostatic capacity (stray capacitance)d: distance between wiresa: diameter of wire R3-2.1.2 According to the above-mentioned equation(1), it is understood that the stray capacitance does notaffect the frequency but is inversely proportional tologarithm of the distance between wires. (This meansthat the closer the distance between high potentialsbecomes, the more the stray capacitance increases, andthe longer the wire becomes, the stray capacitanceincreases as well.)R3-2.2 Leakage CurrentR3-2.2.1 The leakage current is the inverter secondarycurrent that flows to the above-mentioned straycapacitance. (It equal to the inverter secondary currentexcept for that of CCFL.) Suppose C is the straycapacitance around CCFL and I is the current that flows to C and sinusoidal AC voltage is applied, thebellow-equation is obtained. I = CV = 2fCV ------ (2)whereI: leakage current (true AC current)f: AC frequencyC: stray capacitance (electrostatic capacity)V: tube voltage (true AC voltage) R3-2.2.2 According to the above-mentioned equation(2), the leakage current increases proportionally to theincrease of the frequency, stray capacitance, orpotential difference.R3-2.2.3 Since the stray capacitance and leakagecurrent increase or decrease by each parameter such asthe length of high voltage wire, distance between thewire and the conductor of ground, lighting frequencyand potential difference, it is recommended thatmeasuring conditions should be specified andstandardized as much as possible. R3-3 Temperature CharacteristicsR3-3.1 The CCFL is quite sensitive to mercurytemperature characteristics because its fluorescentsubstance emits light receiving ultraviolet rays frommercury particles as activation energy.R3-3.2 If the temperature of mercury particles isregarded as the same as the CCFL wall temperaturewhen lighting, and suppose the tube temperature is25°C at 0°C of ambient temperature against walltemperature at 50°C, approximately 1/10 of saturatedsteam pressure difference will take place and actualluminance of the tube will be approximately 1/2. Onthe contrary for the high temperature side, suppose thewall temperature is 100°C against the ambienttemperature 70°C the steam pressure difference whichis greater by 20 times will take place and the actual tubeluminance is approximately 2/3.R3-3.3 In this manner, the temperature and tubeluminance have peak characteristics within a certaintemperature range because the partial pressures of Ar,Ne and Hg have the optimum density against thelighting tube current. When the temperature is low, theluminance decreases due to the lack of absolute amountof ultraviolet rays caused by insufficient mercurymolecules.

&lt;!-- Page 50 --&gt;

SEMI D35-1103E © SEMI 2003 12 R3-3.4 On the other hand, when the temperature ishigh, the mercury molecule density goes updramatically, reabsorption of ultraviolet rays bymercury itself takes place, the amount of ultravioletrays that reach the fluorescent substance decreases andso the luminance decreases accordingly. The furtherattention necessary is that the mass (thickness) of glasstube is made as thin as possible because the CCFL hasbeen developed with such top priority as to have thenarrow diameter, space-saving shape and highluminance. For this reason, the heat capacity is verysmall, which means the inside mercury moleculetemperature will be affected greatly by heat transfercaused by interference with surrounding members andcooling effect of convective wind to the glass.R3-3.5 Since the luminance varies due to the impact tothe glass temperature by each parameter such as theinterference of surrounding members, contact of othermaterials and cooling effect of convective wind, it isrecommended that measuring conditions should bespecified and standardized as much as possible.

Since the starting point of maindischarge may vary by the slide-up speed, a specialattention should be paid.R3-4.2 When the slide-up speed is so slow that theratio of partial pressure of Ar, Ne and Hg shifts to thecondition where lighting is easily performed becausethe mercury vapor pressure increases by the heatgeneration caused by half-lighting, the main dischargemay begin easily compared to the condition at lowCCFL temperature.R3-4.3 Therefore, when measuring the CCFL, theseconditions should be specified and standardized asmuch as possible. R3-5 Use of Master CCFLR3-5.1 When interrelating the spectroradiometer andcolorimeter, an actual CCFL is used often as a masterCCFL.Precautions for such cases are1) the registration date, production history, lightinghistory and expiring date of the master CCFLshould be specified and attached to it, and2) the master CCFL should be kept such that thereshall be no impact to reproduction ofmeasurement.R3-5.2 Since this document is positioned as a relateddocument to standardized documents, the contents aretreated as just for information.NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties orrepresentations as to the suitability of the standards setforth herein for any particular application.
