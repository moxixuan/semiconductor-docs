GUIDE FOR EFEM FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE MODEL
This  guide  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Physical  Interfaces  and  Carriers  Committee  and  is  the
direct  responsibility  of  the  North  American  Physical  Interfaces  and  Carriers  Committee.  Current  edition
approved  by  the  North  American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  16,  2004.    Initially  available  at
<a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> September 2004, to be published November. Originally published February 2000; previously
published October 2000.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  Productivity   improvement   is   the   task   with   the
highest  priority  in  semiconductor  factories  of  the  300
mm   generation,   and   computer-integrated   manufact-
uring  or  factory  automation  (CIM/FA)  technologies
become more and more important to accomplish it. The
standardization  of  these  technologies  is  also  necessary
to  provide  the  CIM/FA  infrastructure  in  a  short  period
of time at a low cost.   Since the standards will have to
cover a wide range of production equipment, communi-
cation hardware, and software tools, it is very important
that  the  standards  have  a  high  degree  of  compatibility.
In   order   to   improve   the   compatibility,   this   guide
provides  a  functional  structure  model  of  an  Equipment
Front  End  Module  (EFEM)  that  handles  carriers  and
substrates  at  the  interface  between  the  factory  material
handling system and the process equipment.</li><li>2  The major purposes of this guide are as follows:
1)  provide  a  common  understanding  of  functions  of
EFEM  (Equipment  Front  End  Module)  and  associated
interfaces  between  functional  elements  (components
with particular function roles),
2) provide a common understanding of the hierarchical
structure of functions and their interfaces in an EFEM,
3)  provide  a  common  understanding  of  possible  units
used for maintenance, adjustment, and control, and
4)  provide  a  map  between  EFEM  functional  elements
and existing standards.
2  Scope</li><li>1  Model Structure and Functions</li><li>1.1  This document recognizes EFEM as a component
of  semiconductor  manufacturing  equipment.  It  creates
an EFEM functional structure model to clearly describe
EFEM,  its  functional  elements,  and  the  functions  of
each functional element. The functional structure model
includes the following:
1)   definition   of   functional   elements   that   constitute
EFEM,
2) definition of functions of functional elements, and
3) hierarchical description of functional elements.</li><li>1.2  For   clarity,   Fixed   Buffer   Type   EFEM   and
Internal  Buffer  Type  EFEM  (see  Terminology)  are
represented  as  independent  functional  structure  models
in this document.</li><li>2  Preconditions for Modeling</li><li>2.1  The   models   are   created   under   the   following
conditions:
1)   Modeling   should   be   restricted   to   SEMI   E15.1,
Option  1,  Options  2  and  3,  and  Option  3  types.  (See
SEMI E15.1, Figure 2 (Load Port Options)).
2) The model supports handling of open cassette (OC),
and    Front    Opening    Unified    Pod    (FOUP)    (see
Terminology).
3)  The  model  is  created  for  the  maximum  structure
including options.
4) Functional elements that have interfaces with  EFEM
are also included in the model.
NOTE 1: Functional elements that don’t belong to EFEM, but
are  important  in  defining  interfaces  among  the  functional
elements,   are   represented   in   this   model   to   clarify   their
functional positions and attributes in the entire equipment.

6  Definition of Functional Elements
6. 1  Overall Structure
6. 1.1  Figures  1,  2  and  Figures  3,  4  show  conceptual
structures  of  two  types  of  Fixed  Buffer  Type  EFEM
model  and  two  types  of  Internal  Buffer  Type  EFEM
model  in  overall  structure  of  equipment.  Two  types  of
EFEM   exist,   when   Substrate   Handler   is   installed
outside   the   Process   Part,   and   when   the   Substrate
Handler is included inside the Process Part.
6. 1.2  EFEM  <!-- -->[1]<!-- -->  —  This  is  a  major  module  whose
functions are to transfer carriers to and from the factory
material handling system, to provide all carrier handling

processing.  It  consists  of  a  Carrier  Handler  and  may
contain a Substrate Handler.
6. 1.3  Carrier   Handler   <!-- -->[1]<!-- -->   —   A   Carrier   Handler
receives  and  passes  the  carriers  from  and/or  to  the
external  system  (such  as  the  factory  material  handling
system). A Carrier Handler of the Internal Buffer Type
has  the  functions  of  handling  and  storing  the  carriers.
A  carrier  handler  for  FOUPs  has  the  opener(s)  for
opening and closing FOUPs.
6. 1.4  Substrate  Handler  <!-- -->[0,1]<!-- -->  —  A  Substrate  Handler
transfers substrates between the carriers and the process
part of the equipment.
6. 1.5  Load Port Group <!-- -->[1+]<!-- --> — The load port group is
where  carriers  are  received  and  passed  from  or  to  the
external  system  (such  as  the  factory  material  handling

MECHANICAL SPECIFICATION FOR A 300 mm SINGLE-WAFER BOX
SYSTEM THAT EMULATES A FOUP
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Physical  Interfaces  &amp;  Carriers  Committee  and  is
the direct responsibility of the European Equipment Automation Committee. Current edition approved by the
European Regional Standards Committee on May 14, 2004.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> June 2004;
to be published July 2004. Originally published June 2000; last published November 2003.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1      This   standard   specifies   the   carrier   side   of   the
mechanical  interface  between  load  ports  (or  buffers)
with    FIMS    interfaces    on    process    or    metrology
equipment  and  a  system  that  includes  a  box  that  holds
only one wafer (such as a test wafer) and that fits onto
an  adapter  mechanism  called  a  single-wafer  interface
(SWIF).  This system appears to the equipment to be a
300 mm FOUP (except that only the volume around the
middle wafer may be accessible).
2  Scope</li><li>1  This standard is intended to set an appropriate level
of    specification    that    places    minimal    limits    on
innovation    while    ensuring    modularity    and    inter-
changeability  at  relevant  mechanical  interfaces.    Only
the  mechanical  interface  between  a  load  port  with  a
FIMS  interface  and  this  system  (of  a  single-wafer  box
and a SWIF) is specified here; the mechanical interface
between  the  single-wafer  box  and  the  SWIF  is  not
specified.    Also  not  specified  is  the  method  by  which
the  SWIF  raises  the  carrier  sensing  pads  when  the
single-wafer  box  is  removed  (see  Section  6.3).    This
standard  does  not  forbid  the  SWIF  from  holding  more
than   just   the   single-wafer   box   mentioned   in   this
standard.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

6  Requirements
6. 1  System  Components  —  A  system  that  conforms  to
this  standard  must  include  a  box  that  holds  one  wafer
and that fits onto a SWIF.
6. 2  Relevant  FOUP  Dimensions  —  The  SWIF  must
have  all  of  the  required  bottom  and  front  features  and
be no larger than the maximum dimensions of a 13- or
25-wafer FOUP. However, this system (of single-wafer
box and SWIF) must have box placement sensing pads
as    specified    in    SEMI    E47.1    FOUP    standards
Requirements  Section  6.12.  For  example,  the  SWIF
must  comply  with  dimensions  r67,  x53,  y50,  y51,  y52,
y53, z41, z47 – z48, z47 + z49, and the upper limits on
x50  and  y40  (as  specified  in  SEMI  E47.1)  and  with
dimension y33 (as specified in SEMI E62).
6. 3  Optional Automation Features — Since the single-
wafer   box   and/or   SWIF   will   usually   be   delivered
manually  (possibly  with  a  PGV),  the  SWIF  is  not
required  to  have  the  other  automation  features  of  the
FOUP such as the robotic handling flange on top or the
fork-lift flanges on the side (although this standard does
not forbid the SWIF from having such features).
6. 4  SWIF Door — The SWIF must have a full FOUP-
size door (which surrounds the door of the single-wafer
box)  that  mates  with  a  FIMS-compatible  interface  (as
specified  in  SEMI  E62)  to  avoid  contaminating  the
environment   on   the   equipment   side   of   the   FIMS
interface.
6. 5  Wafer  Position  —  When  the  FIMS  door  is  opened
by the equipment, the end effector may only be able to
access  the  middle  wafer  slot  (wafer  7  for  a  SWIF  that
emulates  a  13-wafer  carrier,  and  wafer  13  for  a  SWIF
that  emulates  a  25-wafer  carrier),  because  a  surface
immediately  behind  the  door  may  block  access  to  the
other  wafer  slots.    Thus,  batch  wafer  handlers  will
probably not work with this system.
6. 6  Wafer  Clearances  —  The  clearance  below  the
middle  wafer  must  be  the  same  as  the  clearance  below
the  bottom  wafer  in  an  ordinary  FOUP  (z8  minus  z6,
both  from  SEMI  E1.9),  and  the  clearance  above  the
middle  wafer  must  be  the  same  as  the  clearance  above
the  top  wafer  in  an  ordinary  FOUP  (z15  from  SEMI
E1.9).    These  vertical  clearances  are  defined  in  SEMI
E1.9  and  SEMI  E47.1  and  apply  throughout  the  wafer
set-down  and  extraction  volumes  for  the  middle  wafer.
The horizontal clearances shown in Figure 10 of SEMI
E47.1 are also required.  One possible example of such
a  system  (of  single-wafer  box  and  SWIF)  is  shown  in
Figures 1 and 2 (with vertical clearances indicated).</p><p>wafer

removed  from  the  load  port  when  single-wafer  boxes
are  removed  and  replaced  on  the  SWIF.    However,
when  the  single-wafer  box  is  removed  from  the  SWIF,
all of the carrier sensing pads (defined in Section 6.6 of
SEMI E1.9) on the bottom of the SWIF must be raised
(so that the load port can sense a change of carriers by
its carrier placement sensor, if any). However, in order
to  ensure  that  the  SWIF  triggers  most  optical  carrier
presence detectors on the load port, the SWIF (without
a   single-wafer   box)   must   block   any   line   of   sight
through a volume consisting of the smallest cylindrical
section  that  contains  all  of  the  wafer  pick-up  volumes
(defined  in  SEMI  E1.9)  of  the  corresponding  FOUP
(defined  in  SEMI  E47.1).    Note  that  this  standard  does
not  prevent  the  use  of  other  kinds  of  carrier  presence
detectors (such as sensors that detect weight on the load
port).

R1-1
R1-1.1    In  fabs  in  which  this  system  (of  single-wafer  box  and  SWIF)  is  used,  equipment  should  have  control
software  algorithms  that  prevent  end  effectors  and  wafer  slot  mappers  from  entering  the  carrier  except  in  the
clearances around the middle wafer (defined in Section 6.2) when the presence of this system is detected.  A variety
of methods for differentiating the system from ordinary FOUPs are possible.
R1-1.2    Using  sensors,  equipment  can  differentiate  the  system  (of  single-wafer  box  and  SWIF)  from  ordinary
FOUPs.  For example, sensors below the info pad B location on the load port and on the FIMS door (opposite the
seal zones or the reserved spaces for vacuum application on the box door) could indicate that the carrier type is an
open  cassette  but  with  a  FOUP  door,  together  implying  the  presence  of  this  system  (of  a  single-wafer  box  and
SWIF).  Note that such sensors on the load port are not currently specified in any SEMI standard.
R1-1.3    Carrier  ID  tags  can  inform  the  equipment  that  the  load  port  holds  this  system  (of  single-wafer  box  and
SWIF) instead of an ordinary FOUP.
R1-1.4  Messages from the host computer system can inform the equipment that the load port holds this system (of
single-wafer box and SWIF) instead of an ordinary FOUP.</p><p>NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the specification set forth herein for

SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR
CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR
This specification was technically approved by the Global Metrics Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  European  Equipment  Automation  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  European  Regional
Standards Committee on January 8, 2003.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> January 2003; to be published
March 2003. Originally published October 2000; previously published March 2002.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1      The   use   of   in   situ   particle   monitoring   (ISPM;
particle   measurements   performed   while   the   wafer
resides  inside  the  processing  chamber)  in  low-pressure
and    vacuum    applications    provides    a    number    of
advantages    for    defect,    process,    and    equipment
management such as:
• Reduction  of  particle  test  wafers  used  for  off-line
tests and saving operator time,
• Optimization  and  real-time  characterization  of  the
process,
• Advanced process control,
• Advanced equipment control,
• Monitoring process chamber conditions, and
• Optimization     of     cleaning     procedures     and
maintenance.</li><li>1.1        Therefore,    ISPM    achieves    more    equipment
availability   and   faster   ramp-up   of   the   production,
reduces  cost  of  ownership,  improves  quality  and  yield.
To   reach   these   goals,   ISPM   needs   to   be   easily
integrated  into  new  or  existing  process  equipment  and
the  acquisition  as  well  as  the  analysis  of  the  particle
data  needs  to  be  automated.  The  ISPM  sensor  should
not have any negative influence on the process and the
measurement  has  to  represent  the  main  particle  flow.
The  sensor  should  be  designed  to  have  a  minimum
negative impact on the parameters defined in SEMI E10
for  the  whole  semiconductor  process  equipment,  to
achieve an advantage in capacity.</li><li>2    This  standard  is  intended  to  stipulate  operating
conditions,  mechanical,  electrical,  and  communication
interfaces    for    the    use    of    Low-pressure    Particle
Detectors     integrated     in     semiconductor     process
equipment.  A  guideline  for  a  reference  calibration  of
those sensors is intended to support correlation between
measurements with different sensors.
2  Scope</li><li>1      This   standard   applies   to   particle   measurement
under    low-pressure    and    vacuum    conditions    in
semiconductor manufacturing equipment.
NOTICE: This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability  of  regulatory  or  other  limitations  prior  to
use.

NOTE  2:    This  is  a  general  definition  of  LDL.  Due  to  the
special design of most of the LPPDs, a counting efficiency of
50% can not be achieved.
4. 2.13  low-pressure    particle    detector    (LPPD) 
optical  particle  sensor  for  use  under  low-pressure  and

Section 9.2.3.5.
4. 2.18  sensitivity    in   particle   measurement:   the
smallest    standard    particle    size    specified    by    the
manufacturer  that  an  instrument,  method,  or  system  is
capable of measuring under specified conditions (with a
counting  efficiency  of  50%;  see  Appendix  2).  Also
called minimum detectable particle size.
4. 2.19  ultrafine    particle     a    particle    with    an

contribution  by  gas  distribution  system  components,  a
purified    gas    that    has    an    insignificant    particle
concentration above the lower detectable limit (LDL) of
the  analytical  instrument.  This  gas  is  used  for  both
instrument calibration and component testing.

ISO 1609 (ISO-K and ISO-F)
ISO 3669 (ISO-K-CF)</p><p>SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 2003 5
5. 2  Space, Distances, and Installation
5. 2.1    The  use  of  an  LPPD  should  not  have  a  negative
impact on the process performance. The sensor location
in  the  equipment  shall  ensure  an  optimum  use  of  the
sensor  sensitivity  in  order  to  allow  a  measurement
which  is  representative  of  the  main  particle  flow.  The
influence  of  the  process  and  the  process  equipment  on
the  LPPD  shall  be  minimized  (thermal  background
radiation, vibrations etc.)
5. 2.2    The  standard  does  not  specify  where  an  LPPD
should be located in original equipment, or where space
should be allowed for retro-fitting. It is recognized that
the location is dependent on factors including transport
behavior of particles, thermal background radiation etc.
The   designers   of   semiconductor   process   equipment
should resort to the experience of application engineers
of  the  LPPD  suppliers  and  the  end  users.  However,  in
either  case  designers  shall  take  into  account  access
requirements for maintenance and re-calibration. In the
case  of  retro-fitting,  the  design  should  facilitate  sensor
installation rather than hinder it.
6  Electrical Interfaces
6. 1  Sensor/Controller Communication
6. 1.1    Depending  on  the  choice  of  the  LPPD  supplier
and the semiconductor equipment manufacturer, one of
the  following  interfaces  for  data  exchange  between  the
LPPD and process equipment controller should be used.
6. 1.2  Sensor/Actuator Network (SAN)
6. 1.2.1  The electrical interfaces of the Sensor/ Actuator
Network   are   described   in   the   suite   of   SEMI   E54
standards.

6. 2  Others
6. 2.1  Sensor calibration output (direct analog output)
6. 2.1.1    The  analog  output  for  access  to  the  sensor
signal used for calibration purpose should be supported.
7  Communication Interfaces
7. 1  Sensor Bus Communication
7. 1.1      It   is   recommended   to   use   a   Sensor/Actuator
Network   (SAN)   for   the   intra-tool   communication
between  the  LPPD  controller  and  the  controller  of  the
process  equipment.  This  communication  is  based  on  a
suite    of    SEMI    standards    including    a    network
communication    standard,    several    common    device
models  (DeviceNet,  SDS,  Lonworks,  ProfiBus  etc.),
and  the  specific  device  model  for  the  sensor.  The
Network  is  described  by  the  following  suite  of  SEMI
standards:  SEMI  E54.    The  specific  device  model  for
ISPM is described by SEMI E54.10.
7. 2  SEMI Equipment Communication (SECS)
7. 2.1  If LPPD controllers provide the collected particle
data   to   the   process   equipment   controller,   factory
automation  system,  or  SPC  system,  the  SECS  tool-to-
host  communication  could  be  used.  SECS  is  described
in the following standards:
• SEMI E5
• SEMI E4
• SEMI E37
7. 3  Attribute Definitions
7. 3.1    SEMI  E54.10  addresses  the  minimum  attributes,
services  and  behavior  an  ISPM-device  shall  support.  If
any  attributes  and  services  are  used  by  communication
of the ISPM and the equipment controller via IEEE 488
(IEC  60625)  or  serial  communication,  they  should  be
concurring.
8  Operating Conditions
8. 1    To  specify  the  operating  conditions  of  an  LPPD
(temperature,  humidity,  electromagnetic  compatibility,
vibrations etc.) refer to the following standards:
• IEC 60654-1
• IEC 60654-2
• IEC 60654-3
• IEC 60654-4
• IEC 60801-1
8. 2  Temperature
8. 2.1    The  LPPD  should  work  correctly  at  an  ambient
temperature  range  T
A
as  specified  in  ISO  14644-5.  If
the use of an LPPD at an extended ambient temperature
range  is  required,  the  specific  LPPD  should  comply
with these conditions.
8. 2.2    The  temperature  T
G
inside   the   pump   line   or
inside  the  process  equipment  depends  on  the  actual
application.  The  application  engineers  shall  check  the
use  of  LPPDs  under  these  specific  conditions.  The
temperature  T
G
is  measured  at  the  flange  which  the
LPPD is mounted on.</p><p>SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 2003 6
8. 3  Humidity
8. 3.1    The  LPPD  should  work  correctly  at  an  ambient
humidity  range  RH  as  specified  in  ISO  14644-5.  If  the
use of an LPPD at an extended ambient humidity range
is  required,  the  specific  LPPD  should  comply  with
these conditions.
8. 4  Electromagnetic Compatibility
8. 4.1  The equipment should comply with SEMI E33.
8. 4.2      Sensors   will   be   incorporated   into   equipment
either  as  original  equipment  or  retro-fitted.  In  either
case,  the  sensors  or  the  equipment  of  which  they  are  a
part   should   comply   with   the   current   regulations
covering  EMC  in  the  country  or  region  where  the
equipment or sensor is used.
8. 5  Vibrations
8. 5.1      Process   equipment   designers   are   advised   to
consider  the  impact  of  vibration  on  the  performance  of
the  sensor  while  it  is  collecting  data.  Therefore,  they
should minimize vibrations. The designers of the LPPD
sensors  are  also  advised  to  consider  the  impact  of
vibrations  on  the  equipment  at  a  time  the  sensor  is  not
collecting  any  data.  It  might  be  possible  that  these
vibrations  are  stronger  than  those  occurring  while  the
sensor is collecting data.
9  Reference Calibration Procedure
9. 1      The   response   of   real   contamination   particles,
typically  with  refractive  indices  and  shapes  different
from  calibration  particles,  will  differ  slightly  from  the
results  obtained  by  the  procedures  in  this  document.  It
is known that LPPDs with different optical design may
not   produce   the   same   data   from   identical   aerosol
samples.  This  may  happen  even  with  similar  LPPDs  if
calibration differences have occurred. Therefore, before
the  first  use  the  sensor  should  be  calibrated  by  the
manufacturer.   This   calibration   should   be   compliant
with or should be reviewed with the following reference
calibration  equipment  and  procedure.  This  reference
calibration     allows     the     characterization     of     the
performance of the LPPD under test. The LPPD should
be  recalibrated  at  regular  intervals  and  also  in  case  of
unusual measurement readings to ensure correct results.
9. 1.1  The parameters calibrated for LPPDs with sizing
capability are:
• Sizing calibration,
• Resolution,
• Zero counting,
• Counting efficiency, and
• Sensitivity.
9. 1.2    The  parameters  calibrated  for  LPPDs  with  non-
sizing capability are:
• Zero counting, and
• Counting efficiency.
9. 1.3    Field  calibration  may  not  necessarily  require  the
calibration of all parameters performed by calibration at
the sensor manufacturers site.
9. 1.4    Due  to  the  fact  that  different  LPPDs  might  be
working  with  different  detection  areas  A
L
,  the  number
of  counts  should  be  printed  out  in  counts  per  mm
2</p><p>detection    area.    Therefore,    a    comparison    of    the
measurement  results  of  different  LPPDs  is  possible.
The  size  of  the  detection  area  A
L
shall  be  reported  in
the  calibration  report  form.  Any  changes  of  calibration
parameters  or  of  the  calibration  setup  shall  be  reported
in the calibration report form. A copy of the calibration
report form shall be delivered with the sensor.
9. 2  Apparatus
9. 2.1  Materials
9. 2.1.1  Particles
9. 2.1.1.1      Calibration   particles   are   polymer   spheres
composed of polystyrene or a similar polymer, having a
refractive index of 1.58-1.61+0i (absorption coefficient
α  =  0),  a  sizing  accuracy  of  at  least  95%,  and  a  size
distribution  in  which  the  coefficient  of  variation  is  5%
or  less.  They  should  be  traceable  to  a  nationally  or
internationally recognized standard (e.g. NIST
9
).
9. 2.1.1.2        The    calibration    particles    are    normally
supplied  in  concentrations  too  high  to  be  used  directly
in aerosol generators. The particles should be dispersed
and   diluted   in   either   deionized,   distilled   water   in
accordance with ASTM D1193, Type 1, or Isopropanol.
The diluent should be cleaned using a filter with a pore
size no more than 10% of the size of the particles being
used. The solution should be stored in a clean container.
For   generation   and   dilution   of   the   suspension   see
Appendix  3.  After  generation  the  particles  should  be
neutralized   to   avoid   surface   charge.   For   all   tests
described in this document, the concentration should be
no  more  than  25%  of  the  maximum  recommended
concentration  limit  specified  by  the  manufacturer.  For
calibration a suitable set of particle sizes shall be used.
This  set  should  contain  at  least  5  sizes  that  cover  the
LDL size to at least 80% of the specified maximum size
measurement capability of the LPPD.
NOTE   4:   Most   of   the   ISPM   sensors   are   based   on   light
scattering.  The  intensity  of  the  scattered  light  detected  by  a
photodetector  depends  on  intensity,  polarization  state,  and</p><p>9 National Institute of Standards and Technology, 100 Bureau Drive,
Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001, USA</p><p>SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 2003 7
wavelength  of  the  incident  light  beam,  diameter,  shape,  and
refractive  index  of  the  particle  and  the  suspension  fluid,  as
well as on the geometrical layout of the collection optics and
detector.  In  the  particle  size  range  near  the  wavelength  (0.1λ
&lt;  d
P
&lt;  10λ),  large  oscillations  can  be  seen  in  the  intensity
curve of the light scattered by spherical particles as a function
of  all  these  parameters.  This  phenomenon  should  be  taken
into account when selecting a suitable set of particle sizes for
calibration.  The  used  calibration  particles  should  be  within  a
monotonic response range of the LPPD response curve.
9. 2.1.2  Zero Gas
9. 2.1.2.1    Clean  air  or  nitrogen  filtered  with  a  ULPA
filter.
NOTE  5:  The  calibration  will  be  executed  under  atmospheric
pressure   and   zero   gas.   In   semiconductor   manufacturing,
pressure  and  process  gases  will  differ  from  the  calibration
conditions.  This  will  affect  the  refractive  index  ratio  of  the
particles  and  the  process  gas  and  consequently  the  scattering
from the particles.
9. 2.1.3  Surfaces
9. 2.1.3.1      The   materials   of   pump   lines   and   other
components    should    be    conductive    to    minimize
electrostatic interaction with the particles.
9. 2.2  Instrumentation  (see  Figure  1)  —  Some  LPPDs
may   require   specialized   equipment   not   generally
available. Please contact the LPPD manufacturer.
9. 2.2.1  Fan System
9. 2.2.1.1  The fan or pump system should be adjustable
to  transport  the  aerosol  and  the  zero  gas  within  the
stipulated  velocity  range  v
L,  min
...  v
L,max
,  specified  by
the manufacturer of the LPPD.
9. 2.2.2  Filter System
9. 2.2.2.1    The  ULPA  filter  system  is  used  for  gener-
ation of zero gas. The filter system should be capable of
removing  particles  at  the  minimum  size  detectable  by
the LPPD or the reference particle counter.
9. 2.2.3  Aerosol Generator
9. 2.2.3.1        An    atomizer    converts    the    monodisperse
particle  suspension  to  an  aerosol  by  using  compressed
zero   gas   for   generation   and   transportation   of   the
particles.    The    aerosol    generator    should    generate
monodisperse  particles  as  defined  in  Section  9.2.1.1  in
constant   and   reproducible   concentration   C
G
under
constant  and  reproducible  volume  flow  rate  V ́
G
.  The
variation in particle concentration shall be no more than
10% as measured by the reference particle counter over
a  time  period  of  10  times  or  more  of  the  sample
measurement time. The generation should comply with
the   German   VDI-Richtlinie   3491,   or   an   equivalent
standard in other countries.
9. 2.2.4  Aerosol dryer
9. 2.2.4.1  The monodisperse polymer spheres in the test
aerosol   shall   be   thoroughly   dry   to   avoid   that   the
particles have a water layer which would increase their
size. A diffusion dryer, another appropriate instrument,
or adequately dry dilution air should be used to dry the
particles. The diffusion dryer uses silica gel desiccant to
remove the moisture. The desiccant shall either be new
or  freshly  regenerated.    The  design  flow  rate  of  the
aerosol dryer shall at least match the output flow rate of
the aerosol generator.
NOTE   6:   Some   diffusion   dryers   may   precipitate   polymer
spheres and add other particles when the aerosol gets in direct
contact with the silica gel.
9. 2.2.5  Neutralizer
9. 2.2.5.1  An aerosol neutralizer should be connected in
line with the dryer to reduce electrostatic charges on the
dry    polymer    spheres    and    to    avoid    electrostatic
interaction with each other or the line wall. The design
flow  rate  of  the  aerosol  neutralizer  shall  at  least  match
the output flow rate of the aerosol generator.
NOTE 7: Some electrostatic neutralizers may produce a large
number  of  ultra-fine  particles  which  will  combine  with  the
calibration aerosol.
9. 2.2.6  Aerosol Size Separator
9. 2.2.6.1      In   the   case   of   calibration   with   ultra-fine
particles,  a  system  should  be  used  to  separate  single
polymer  spheres  from  the  residual  particles  resulting
from  vaporization  of  solutions  and  aggregate  particles
consisting of several spheres. The size separation could
be   achieved   with   an   electrostatic   classifier   or   a
diffusion battery.
9. 2.2.7  Aerosol Dilution
9. 2.2.7.1      If   the   particle   concentration   behind   the
aerosol  generator  is  too  high,  the  particle  flow  shall  be
diluted  to  achieve  the  required  concentration  and  to
avoid  coincidence  errors.  The  dilution  should  comply
with the German VDI-Richtlinie 3491, or an equivalent
standard in other countries.
9. 2.2.8  Aerosol Line System
9. 2.2.8.1  The system consisting of
• the aerosol generator,
• the aerosol dryer,
• the neutralizer,
• the particle size separator,
• the dilution stage, and
• tubing  connecting  the  devices  with  each  other  and
the filtered, dried and compressed zero gas.</p><p>SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 2003 8
9. 2.2.8.2    The  line  system  should  be  smooth,  conduc-
tive, and electrically grounded to minimize electrostatic
interaction of the particles with line walls and the parti-
cles themselves. The line should be as short and straight
as possible with no bends with a radius of curvature less
than 100 mm. Leak-free connections of the line and all
devices should be ensured using appropriate fittings.
9. 2.2.8.3          Figure     1     illustrates     a     recommended
calibration aerosol generation system.
9. 2.2.9  Flow Control
9. 2.2.9.1    The  velocity  of  aerosol  and  the  zero  gas
should  be  within  the  stipulated  range  v
L,  min
...  v
L,max
,
specified by the manufacturer of the LPPD. Dependent
on  the  line  diameter  D
L
,  a  stipulated  aerosol  flow  is
necessary. The velocity meter (e.g. thermoanemometer)
or flow meter should be mounted in a line with known
diameter D
VM
.
NOTE 8:  The aerosol drawn by the reference particle counter
influences  the  velocity  or  flow  measured  by  the  velocity
meter  or  flow  meter  if  it  is  mounted  behind  the  probe  inlet.
This is taken into account when calculating and adjusting the
flow  and  velocity  v
L
at  the  LPPD.  If  the  velocity  meter  or
flow  meter  is  mounted  in  front  of  the  probe  inlet  of  the
reference   particle   counter,   the   device   should   have   no
influence  on  the  particle  size  distribution  measured  by  the
reference particle counter.
9. 2.2.10  Calibration Line System
9. 2.2.10.1  The system consisting of
• a device to inject the particles into the zero gas,
• a  device  to  mix  the  aerosol  sample  with  the  zero
gas to obtain uniform particle concentration,
• a  device  to  adapt  the  LPPD  into  the  line  (diameter
D
L
),
• a  device  to  adapt  the  velocity  meter  or  the  flow
meter,
• a   device   (diameter   D
RC
=   D
L
,   same   particle
concentration  as  at  the  LPPD)  to  draw  a  defined,
isokinetic  sample  from  the  line  for  the  reference
particle counter (the opening area of the probe inlet
should  be  reported  in  the  calibration  report  form),
and
• tubing  connecting  the  devices  with  each  other  and
with the fan and filter system.
9. 2.2.10.2    The  line  system  should  be  smooth,  conduc-
tive, and electrically grounded to minimize electrostatic
interaction of the particles with line walls and the parti-
cles themselves. The line should be as short and straight
as possible with no bends with a radius of curvature less
than 100 mm. Leak-free connections of the line and all
devices should be ensured using appropriate fittings.
9. 2.2.10.3    Figure  1  illustrates  a  recommended  LPPD
calibration system.
NOTE 9: The distance between the device to adapt the LPPD
under  test  and  the  device  for  sample  acquisition  for  the
reference  particle  counter  should  be  as  short  as  possible  to
minimize  particle  loss  and  to  ensure  comparable  particle
concentrations.
9. 2.2.11  Reference Particle Counter (RPC)
9. 2.2.11.1  The reference particle counter is required to
measure  the  actual  concentration  of  the  monodisperse
aerosol  and  the  quality  of  the  zero  gas  inside  the  line.
Therefore,   the   counting   efficiency   of   the   reference
particle  counter  is  defined  as  100%  over  the  range  of
particle  sizes  used  in  the  test.  The  resolution  should  be
better  than  10%  at  the  lower  detection  limit  of  the
LPPD   under   test.   The   values   of   the   measurement
should  be  printed  out  in  counts  per  mm
2
opening  area
A
RC
of the probe inlet. The sample transit line from the
probe inlet and the reference particle counter should be
as short and as straight as possible. Smooth, conductive,
and electrically grounded materials should be used.
9. 2.2.12  Sensor Window Temperature
9. 2.2.12.1    Some  LPPDs  have  the  capability  to  heat
their sensor windows to avoid coating of the window. A
device  to  measure  and  to  adjust  the  sensor  window
temperature  within  the  operating  range  (measurable  to
5%)  should  be  installed  in  the  calibration  setup.  The
thermometer  should  be  calibrated  with  an  accuracy  of
0. 2°C.
9. 2.2.13  Pulse Height Analyzer (PHA)
9. 2.2.13.1    The  external  analyzer  is  connected  with  the
analog sensor calibration output. The PHA should have
at  least  64  channels  and  a  resolution  of  at  least  1%  of
the average voltage that will be measured. The use of a
PHA,  which  is  built  into  the  sensor  electronics,  is
allowed if this PHA meets the criteria mentioned above.
The  required  range  and  speed  will  depend  on  the
performance of the LPPD under test. These parameters
should be obtained by the LPPD manufacturer.
9. 2.2.14  Environmental Monitoring
9. 2.2.14.1        The    environmental    temperature    T
A
is
measured by a thermometer calibrated with an accuracy
of 0.2°C.
9. 2.2.14.2    The  environmental  relative  humidity  RH  is
measured by a hygrometer.
9. 2.2.14.3  The atmospheric pressure p is measured by a
barometer calibrated with an accuracy of 133 Pa.</p><p>SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 2003 9
9. 2.2.15  All instruments used for the reference calibration procedure shall have been checked for valid calibration
in accordance with ISO 10012-1 and 10012-2.  Record all calibration data.

NOTE    10:    Specific    procedures    for    calibrating    different
LPPDs can vary considerably not only between manufacturers
but   between   instrument   models.   For   this   reason,   this
document  cannot  provide  detailed  procedures  for  calibrating
every LPPD. For detailed procedures for calibrating a specific
LPPD,  contact  the  manufacturer.  The  calibration  should  be
performed by a skilled technician.</li><li>3.1    If  the  aerosol  flow  rate  is  varied,  then  particle
residence  time  in  the  detection  area  A
L
will  also  vary.
This  results  in  pulses  of  varying  duration.  Therefore,
the particle velocity v
L
at the LPPD should be constant
and independent of the line diameter D

be  regulated  so  that  the  aerosol  velocity  at  the  velocity
meter  is  v

With  the  known  detection  area  A

of particles C

of the aerosol generator and the zero air
inside the line.
9. 3.2    If  the  response  signal  for  the  used  particle  size
does  not  meet  the  expectations,  the  operator  might  use
another particle size within the required size range.
9. 3.3  Calibration Parameters
9. 3.3.1        The    sample    measurement    time    for    the
calibration  with  each  particle  size  should  be  at  least  30
seconds to avoid statistical errors.
9. 3.3.2    The  calibration  is  to  be  performed  at  ambient
atmospheric   pressure   in   a   controlled   environment
(temperature, humidity, vibrations).
9. 3.3.3    The  calibration  of  the  LPPD  is  to  be  executed
in  a  line  diameter  D
L
in  which  the  LPPD  should  be
installed by the user.

ensure  that  the  coincidence  error  is  always  less  than
10%.</p><p>SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 2003 10
9. 3.3.5      Fixed   velocity   at   the   LPPD:   v
L
=   1   m/s
(independent of line diameter at the LPPD).
9. 3.3.5.1    Some  LPPDs,  e.g.  a  scanning  LPPD  for  the
use   inside   a   process   chamber,   require   a   different
velocity  than  1  m/s  for  calibration.  In  such  cases  the
used  aerosol  velocity  at  the  location  of  the  LPPD  shall
be reported in the calibration report form.
9. 3.4  Initial Setup
9. 3.4.1    Connect  the  aerosol  generator  to  a  supply  of
filtered, dried, and compressed zero gas (see Figure 1).
Connect  a  dryer,  neutralizer,  and  size  separator  (if
necessary) to the aerosol outlet of the particle generator.
If  a  dilution  of  the  aerosol  before  the  injection  in  the
calibration  line  is  necessary,  install  a  dilution  stage
behind the size separator.
9. 3.4.2    Connect  the  aerosol  line  to  the  calibration  line.
Mount  the  LPPD  under  test  behind  the  injection  and
mixing device. Install the sample acquisition device and
the velocity or flow meter into the calibration line.
9. 3.4.3  Connect a PHA to the sensor calibration output
if an appropriate built-in PHA is not available.
9. 3.4.4  Before starting the following procedures, make
sure  all  instruments  are  turned  on  and  allow  a  certain
time for warm-up and temperature stabilization.
9. 3.4.5    Purge  the  aerosol  line  and  the  calibration  line
with filtered and dried air for a minimum of 30 minutes.
9. 3.4.6    Check  the  quality  of  the  zero  gas  and  the
condition of the calibration line using the RPC. Collect
counts  for  three  one-minute  periods  and  determine  the
average  number  of  particles  reported  in  counts  per
minute.  The  volume  flow  of  the  zero  gas  shall  be
enough  for  correct  operation  of  the  RPC.  Record  the
cumulative  particle  count  reported  for  the  zero  gas  for
particles equal to and larger than the LDL of the LPPD
under test.
9. 3.4.7  Clean the aerosol generator liquid reservoir and
fill  it  with  clean  diluent  (particle-free  deionized  or
destilled   water   or   Isopropanol).   Run   the   aerosol
generator  and  adjust  the  pressure  and  flow  rates  as
recommended  by  the  aerosol  generator  manufacturer.
Check  the  condition  of  the  aerosol  line  using  the  RPC.
Collect   counts   for   three   one-minute   periods   and
determine the average number of particles reported per
liter of air. If the number exceeds 1 particle per liter air,
the  diluent  shall  be  refiltered  before  further  use.  The
average number of particles (counts per minute) should
be reported in the calibration report form.
9. 3.4.8  Adjust the volume flow through the calibration
line  for  the  stipulated  aerosol  velocity  at  the  LPPD
under test.
9. 3.4.9    Allow  a  certain  time  for  stabilization  of  the
adjusted   calibration   parameters   before   any   test   is
performed.
9. 3.5  Sizing LPPD
NOTE    11:    For    more    information    and    background    see
Appendix 2.
9. 3.5.1  Size Calibration
NOTE  12:  To  define  the  calibration  settings  either  the  mode
or median of the voltage pulse distribution could be used. The
use of the modal procedure is common. The calibration report
form should identify the used method.

(with  v

),  size  calibration  is
performed. Begin with the largest particles for which a
calibration  value  is  required.  Select  the  particle  size
range for which calibration is required. Be sure that the
particle concentration is low enough that predominantly
individual    pulses    are    generated    by    the    LPPD.
Accumulate enough data to avoid statistical errors. The

9. 3.5.2  Zero Counting
NOTE  14:  The  intent  of  this  procedure  is  not  to  adjust  the
thresholds  for  the  zero  count  rate  but  to  verify  whether  the

counter is used to check the quality of the zero gas. The
minimum  acceptable  sample  time  is  10  minutes.  The
sampling time shall be long enough to provide adequate
sampling statistics. The zero count rate (average counts
per minute) should be recorded in the calibration report

distribution  and  accurate  characterization  of  the  calibration

resolution  is  specified  by  the  coefficient  of  variation  (in  %)

should  be  purged  with  zero  gas  for  a  sufficient  time.

CALIBRATION NOTES
NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI E104 and was approved by full letter ballot
procedures on July 28, 2000 by the European Regional Standards Committee.
A2-1  Size Calibration
A2-1.1          Size     calibration     is     performed     with
monodisperse  particles  with  known  sizes  and  known
optical    properties.    The    procedure    establishes    the
voltage  response  of  the  LPPD  for  these  particles.  The
reported  size  for  unknown  particles  is  the  same  size  of
the monodisperse particle whose voltage response is the
voltage pulse produced by the unknown particle (called
Optical Equivalent Size).
A2-1.2      If   an   LPPD   is   able   to   detect   all   of   the
distribution  (see  counting  efficiency)  generated  by  a
monodisperse   aerosol   and   the   size   of   the   particle
standard is known, the calibrating of an LPPD without a
reference  particle  counter  is  possible.  Ideally,  the  data
collected   by   the   LPPD   observing   a   monodisperse
aerosol   would   describe   a   Gaussian   particle   size
distribution. However, the reported voltage pulse height
distribution is often not symmetric. Therefore, the mode
and  modal  values  of  the  pulse  height  distribution  are
not equal. The thresholds for different particle sizes are
set  as  the  mode  or  median  value  of  the  observed
distribution.  The  modal  voltage  method  is  commonly
used.
A2-1.3    The  intensity  of  the  scattered  light  detected  by
a photodetector depends on intensity, polarization state,
and  wavelength  of  the  incident  light  beam,  diameter,
shape, and refractive index of the particle, as well as on
the  geometrical  layout  of  the  collection  optics  and
detector.  In  the  particle  size  range  near  the  wavelength
(0.1λ &lt; d
P
&lt;  10λ), large oscillations can be seen in the
intensity   curve   of   the   light   scattered   by   spherical
particles   as   a   function   of   all   these   parameters.
Therefore, the response curve might not be monotonic.
Particles  of  more  than  one  size  will  produce  the  same
voltage  output  signal.  The  calibration  particles  should
be chosen so that their response is not included in such
reversals of the calibration curves.
A2-1.4    For  calibration  checks,  a  reference  particle
counter  (RPC)  with  a  good  sizing  capability  could  be
used. The counting efficiency of the RPC shall be 100%
for the particle sizes used in test. The counts of the RPC
and  the  LPPD  under  test  in  the  corresponding  channel
should   be   normalized   to   a   standard   detection   area
(mm
2
).
A2-2  Particle Size Resolution
A2-2.1    Particle  size  resolution  of  a  particle  detector
describes its capability to differentiate between particles
of  nearly  the  same  size,  or  it  is  a  measure  of  the  range
of  sizes  which  the  counter  would  assign  to  a  particular
particle  if  its  size  was  determined  repeatedly.  The
resolution is specified by the coefficient of variation (in
%)  obtained  by  dividing  the  portion  of  the  standard
deviation of the distribution σ
LPPD
that is contributed by
the LPPD by the mean particle size.
A2-2.2  The employed particle size should be at least 2
times   larger   than   the   lower   detection   limit   of   the
instrument and is within a monotonic response range of
the LPPD response curve. The size d
p
and the standard
deviation σ
d,p
of  the  used  particles  is  necessary  to
calculate the resolution.
A2-2.3      To   determine   the   resolution,   the   standard
deviation of the observed particle distribution σ
p,LPPD
is
calculated.  The  quality  of  the  photodetector  is  checked
by   determining   the   standard   deviation   of   the   pure
sensor  signal  σ
V,LPPD
at  the  analog  calibration  output
with a pulse height analyzer. The σ
LPPD
is calculated by
the following formula:</p><p>()()
2
,
2
,pdLPPDpLPPD
σσσ−=</p><p>A2-3  Zero Counting
A2-3.1  The intent of this procedure is not to adjust the
thresholds for the zero count rate but to verify whether
the  LPPD  is  within  its  specification.  It  is  assumed  that
the  zero  count  level  of  a  correct  operating  LPPD  is
sufficiently  better  than  its  specification.  Failure  of  the
verification  test  is  due  to  a  physical  failure  within  the
LPPD    and    not    to    statistical    variation    in    the
measurement.
A2-3.2      The   output   of   a   photodetector   and   the
electronic  circuits  of  the  particle  detector  is  afflicted
with  noise.  The  zero  count  rate  verification  is  carried
out  to  ensure  that  data,  especially  near  the  detection
limit of the LPPD, is generated by particles rather than
by  noise.  To  achieve  this  goal,  the  basic  thresholds  for
the LDL are to be set so that a signal-to-noise ratio of at
least  3  dB  is  ensured.  The  sampling  time  shall  be  long
enough to provide adequate sampling statistics.</p><p>SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 2003 15
A2-4  Counting Efficiency
A2-4.1    The  counting  efficiency  for  a  specific  particle
size is defined as the ratio of the detected concentration
of  particles  to  the  concentration  actually  present.  The
determination  of  the  counting  efficiency  of  an  LPPD
requires  particles  of  known  size  and  concentration  in
the  aerosol.  The  counting  efficiency  is  affected  by
several factors.
• First,  the  counting  efficiency  is  dependent  on  a
specific particle size.
• The  effect  of  particle  concentration  is  addressed
under zero counting and coincidence.
• Due  to  inhomogeneous  light  intensity  within  the
detection area of the particle counter, not all small
particles   near   the   lower   detection   limit   of   the
instrument are detected.
• If  the  sampling  flow  is  not  completely  contained
within   the   defined   detection   area,   then   some
portions of the aerosol will not be counted.
A2-4.2    Ideally,  the  counting  efficiency  of  a  particle
counter covering 100% of the line cross-section area as
detection  area  would  consist  of  a  step  function  at  the
point of the LDL. Real particle detectors have a gradual
transition  (efficiency  curve)  instead  of  a  step  function.
The point with 50% detection probability of all particles
of  a  given  size  moving  through  the  detection  area  is
often  used  as  a  reference  point.  The  corresponding
particle  size  is  called  the  minimum  detectable  particle
size (see sensitivity). If the slope of the efficiency curve
for   two   detectors   with   the   same   specified   50%
efficiency  point  is  different,  the  two  detectors  may
show different particle counts for the same polydisperse
aerosol.  To  define  an  efficiency  curve,  more  than  one
particle  size,  e.g.  5  particle  sizes  around  the  LDL
covering   0%   to   100%   efficiency,   should   be   used.
Acceptable   counting   efficiency   for   single   particle
counting  instruments  is  50%  ±  20%  at  the  minimum
detection  size  and  100%  ±  10%  for  all  particles  larger
than 1.5 times the minimum size.
A2-4.3    The  detection  area  of  most  LPPDs  comprises
only  a  small  portions  of  the  cross-section  area  of  the
line.  Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  specify  a  50%
efficiency point. For this, the commonly used definition
for sensitivity could not be used for such instruments.
A2-4.4  The actual particle concentration is determined
with a reference particle counter with a 100% counting
efficiency for the employed particle size. It is important
that  there  are  no  differences  between  the  concentration
within   the   detection   area   of   the   LPPD   and   the
concentration monitored by the RPC.
A2-5  Sensitivity
A2-5.1    The  particle  size  corresponding  to  the  point
with 50% counting efficiency of the particles of a given
size is defined as the minimum detectable particle size.
This is valid only for particle counters capable to reach
100%  counting  efficiency  for  a  specific  particle  size.
This does not apply to most LPPDs.
A2-6  Particle Concentration Effects
A2-6.1  All optical particle detectors are able to operate
accurately   only   within   a   limited   range   of   particle
concentration.  It  is  not  the  scope  of  this  document  to
define  how  this  limit  is  measured  or  how  to  verify  the
specification.
A2-6.2  High Concentration Effects
A2-6.2.1        The    upper    limitation    of    the    particle
concentration is chiefly based on coincidence effects.
A2-6.2.2    One  effect  is  optical  coincidence.  If  the
particle   concentration   is   too   high,   more   than   one
particle  is  present  within  the  detection  area  of  the
instrument.  The  reported  particle  concentration  will  be
less  than  the  true  value,  and  the  reported  particle  size
distribution  will  be  shifted  towards  the  indication  of
larger particles than in reality.
A2-6.2.3    The  other  effect  is  electronic  coincidence.  It
is   defined   as   the   inability   of   the   electronic   pulse
processing  system  to  detect  and  size  individual  pulses
that are too closely spaced. If there are so many pulses
that they cannot completely return to the baseline, they
become   superimposed.   Electronic   saturation   occurs.
Electronic coincidence introduces errors in both particle
size  and  counts  as  well.  Normally,  this  problem  is  not
critical    for    modern    electronic    systems.    Optical
coincidence  can  become  a  problem  at  particle  levels
well below the point where electronic saturation occurs.
A2-6.2.4        Another    error    can    occur    when    high
concentrations  of  particles  just  smaller  than  the  lower
detection  limit  of  the  instrument  are  present.  Even
though no single one of these particles will be detected,
scattering-light  levels  from  these  particles  can  increase
the background optical noise level. So, errors might be
produced in particle count data in the lower particle size
ranges reported by the counter.
A2-6.3  Low Concentration Effects
A2-6.3.1    It  is  obvious  that  it  is  necessary  to  collect
sufficient data to determine number and size of particles
within an acceptable confidence limit.</p><p>SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 2003 16

AEROSOL GENERATION AND AEROSOL DILUTION
NOTICE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E104  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot
procedures on July 28, 2000 by the European Regional Standards Committee.
A3-1  Monodisperse Particle Suspension
A3-1.1    Monodisperse  suspensions  of  particles  (PSL)
are available in sizes from 0.02 μm. These particles are
grown by emulsion polymerization and are stabilized in
aqueous  suspensions  with  an  anionic  surfactant.  They
carry   a   negative   charge   which   contributes   to   their
stability.  The  suspension  normally  contains  10%  solids
and  2%  dissolved,  highly  viscous  stabilizer.  The  solid
contains up to 8% emulsifier and inorganics.
A3-1.2      After   evaporation,   these   solids   and   the
stabilizer  will  both  increase  the  diameter  of  the  single
particle and generate a residual nucleus out of an empty
droplet.  These  residual  particles  are  called  secondary
aerosol. The diameter of residual nucleus could be up to
0. 25 μm  according  to  the  PSL  size  and  dilution  of  the
suspension.  Most  of  these  secondary  aerosol  particles
might  be  too  small  to  be  detectable  with  commonly
used  particle  detectors,  but  they  will  have  an  influence
on the noise level because of there high number.
A3-1.3  Out of a high-concentration suspension it is not
possible    to    aerosolize    only    individual    particles.
Droplets  containing  more  than  one  of  the  suspended
particles  will  become  undesirable  agglomerates  upon
evaporation.
A3-1.4  For this, an adequate dilution of the suspension
is  necessary  to  avoid  the  formation  of  aggregates  and
the enlargement of the particles.
A3-2  Generation and Dilution of PSL
Suspension
A3-2.1      A   diluted   PSL   suspension   for   particle
generation in an aerosol generator can be created by the
following procedure:
• Shaking  and/or  ultrasonic  treatment  of  the  PSL
bottle distributed by the PSL manufacturer.
• Placing  one  drop  of  PSL  in  one  liter  of  deionized
or  destilled  water  or  Isopropanol.  The  water  could
be  cleaned  using  a  filter  with  a  pore  size  no  more
than 10% of the size of the particles being used.
• Shaking    and/or    ultrasonic    treatment    of    the
suspension to disperse the particles.
A3-2.2  The suspension will probably need to be diluted
further  to  provide  a  required  particle  concentration.
This    is    necessary    to    avoid    the    formation    of
agglomerates  and  to  restrict  the  size  of  the  secondary
aerosol  particles.  An  equation  to  calculate  the  required
particle  concentration  is  given  in  “The  Generation  of
Aerosols  of  Fine  Particles”  by  O.  Raabe  (see  Section
11).
A3-2.3  The particle suspensions distributed by the PSL
manufacturer  shows  no  detectable  variation  in  particle
characteristics when they are stored in a cool place over
the  years.  Diluted  suspensions  for  atomization  feature
an   aging   process.   Diluted   suspensions   of   polymer
spheres  smaller  than  1  μm  should  not  be  stored  for
more than one week.
NOTE A3-1: Care should be taken to avoid contamination of
the polymer spheres and the suspension.
A3-3  Aerosol Generation
A3-3.1    The  diluted  suspension  is  nebulized  in  the
aerosol    generator.    Great    account    is    taken    of
concentration  and  size  distribution  of  the  generated
droplets and of the volume flow rate V ́
G
. To achieve a
constant  aerosol  production,  the  volume  flow  rate  and
the  droplet  size  distribution  should  be  constant  and
independent   of   the   supplies   of   suspension   in   the
reservoir. The variation in particle concentration should
be  no  more  than  10%  as  measured  by  the  reference
particle  counter  over  a  time  period  of  15  minutes  or
more.
NOTE A3-2: Care should be taken to avoid contamination of
the aerosol generator.
A3-4  Aerosol Drying
A3-4.1      The   water   of   the   generated   droplets   will
completely evaporate when the relative humidity of the
aerosol  flow  behind  the  nebulizer  is  lower  than  70%.
The   volume   flow   of   the   suspension   in   the   nozzle
increases  the  humidity  of  the  filtered  compressed  air
which  has  a  relative  humidity  of  10%–15%  in  spite  of
predrying.  The  use  of  a  diffusion  dryer  or  another
appropriate    instrument    allows    a    higher    relative
humidity   of   the   aerosol   flow   behind   the   aerosol
generator.  The  diffusion  dryer  uses  silica  gel  desiccant
to  remove  the  moisture.  The  desiccant  shall  either  be
new  or  freshly  regenerated.  It  is  not  wise  to  get  the
aerosol  in  direct  contact  with  the  desiccant.  Polymer
spheres will be precipitated and additional particles out
of    the    desiccant    will    change    the    particle    size
distribution of the aerosol.</p><p>SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 2003 17
A3-5  Aerosol Neutralization
A3-5.1    When  dispersing  the  suspension,  the  particles
are  charged.  This  surface  charge  should  be  removed
after  drying  the  aerosol  flow  to  avoid  electrostatic
interactions  with  each  other  or  the  line  walls.  With  the
help  of  the  discharging  distance  of  an  electrostatic
neutralizer,  the  aerosol  is  exposed  to  a  bipolar  ion
source.  Some  electrostatic  neutralizers  may  produce  a
large number of ultra-fine particles which will combine
with  the  calibration  aerosol  and  affects  the  signal-to-
noise-ratio  of  the  LPPD  and  the  reference  particle
counter.
A3-6  Aerosol Size Separation
A3-6.1    When  calibrating  with  ultra-fine  particles,  a
particle  size  separation  might  be  necessary  to  remove
the residue particles and agglomerates. An electrostatic
classifier  is  most  effective  for  particle  sizes  less  than  1
μm.  This  instrument  electrically  charges  the  incoming
aerosol.   With   electrostatic   deflection,   it   separates
selected particles of one mobility. The residue particles
and the larger aggregate particles would be stripped out
of the particle stream consisting of the desired polymer
particles.   To   charge   the   aerosol,   the   electrostatic
classifier  uses  a  radioactive  neutralizer.  The  aerosol
exiting   the   instrument   will   contain   singly   charged
particles.  This  low  charge  level  makes  the  use  of  an
additional        aerosol        neutralizer        unnecessary.
Nevertheless,    conductive    tubing    should    be    used
between   the   aerosol   generator   and   the   LPPD   and
reference   particle   counter   to   minimize   electrostatic
particle loss.
A3-7  Aerosol Dilution
A3-7.1      The   particle   concentration   of   the   aerosol
generated  by  the  nebulizer  might  be  too  high.  The
aerosol should be further diluted to achieve the required
concentration  and  to  avoid  coincidence  errors.  The
dilution  could  be  executed  with  a  mixing  chamber  in
which  the  aerosol  is  mixed  with  zero  gas.  The  internal
chamber  pressure  should  be  stable  and  very  close  to
ambient atmospheric pressure at operational flow rates.
The  spatial  particle  distribution  in  the  exiting  aerosol
should be as homogenous as possible.</p><p>SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 2003 18
APPENDIX 4
AEROSOL TRANSPORT AND AEROSOL SAMPLING
NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI E104 and was approved by full letter ballot
procedures on July 28, 2000 by the European Regional Standards Committee.
A4-1  Aerosol Transport
A4-1.1  Aerosol loss in lines occurs both for small and
larger  particles.  Larger  particles  (approximately  5  μm
and larger) are lost as a result of gravitational settling in
horizontal lines and inertial effects in all lines. Smaller
particles  are  lost  to  the  line  walls  by  diffusion  and  by
electrostatic charge effects.
A4-1.2    A  limitation  of  particle  loss  could  be  achieved
with tubing as short and as straight as possible with no
bends with a radius of curvature less than 100 mm. The
tubing   of   the   calibration   setup   should   be   smooth,
conductive,    and    electrically    grounded.    Stainless,
polished   steel   for   rigid   lines   and   Polyurethane   or
polyvinyl chloride for flexible lines is found acceptable
for   handling   most   aerosols   with   low   electrostatic
particle  loss.  If  long  transit  lines  are  required,  they
should  be  sized  to  permit  a  Reynolds  number  in  the
range  of  5,000  to  25,000  at  the  sample  flow  rate  to
minimize  particle  residence  time  in  the  tubing  without
causing excessive turbulence at high flow rates.
A4-2  Aerosol Sample Acquisition
A4-2.1    The  term  isokinetic  sampling  often  is  used  in
aerosol  measurement  and  characterization.  Isokinetic
sampling of particles in a moving aerosol is performed
by matching the sample probe inlet velocity (flow speed
and
direction) to the velocity of the moving aerosol. At
velocities less than 15 m/s, anisokinetic sampling errors
are    negligible    for    most    particles    smaller    than
approximately 5 μm. Losses of larger particles might be
significant.  The  larger  the  particle,  the  larger  the  loss
due   to   inertial   effects.   Isokinetic   sampling   is   not
possible   in   environmental   conditions   with   varying
velocity, motionless air, and turbulent, random, or non-
unidirectional flow. For better sampling inlet efficiency,
isokinetic or at least isoaxial sampling is recommended
at calibration.</p><p>NOTICE: SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or

OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL
INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS
This guide was technically approved by the Global Physical Interfaces &amp; Carriers Committee and is the direct
responsibility of the North American Physical Interfaces &amp; Carriers Committee. Current edition approved by
the  North  American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  July  11,  2004  and  August  16,  2004.    Initially
available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> September 2004; to be published November 2004.  Originally published October
2000; previously published March 2003. This document replaces SEMI PR6-0200 in its entirety.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  This   document   is   intended   to   help   users   and
suppliers of 300 mm carriers and production equipment
to understand the complex interdependencies among the
SEMI  standards  for  300  mm  physical  interfaces  and
carriers  and  to  determine  which  standards  apply  to
which products.  As shown in Figure 1, these standards
are     highly     inter-related,     have     many     complex
dependencies,  and  inherit  a  numbering  system  (from
legacy 200 mm standards) that is non-intuitive.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This  document  describes  how  the  SEMI  standards
for   300   mm   physical   interfaces   and   carriers   work
together.  This document also clarifies the requirements
(direct  and  indirect)  on  suppliers  of  each  product,  and
suggests how users see these standards and options.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.</li></ol><p>M1.15, M8, M28

3  Limitations
3. 1  300 mm Only — This document only covers SEMI
standards  that  are  specific  to  300  mm,  even  though
other  standards  may  apply  to  300  mm  equipment.    For
example, standards not described here include:
• metrics documents such as SEMI E10;
• minienvironment  documents  such  as  SEMI  E45
and and SEMI E46;
• facilities documents such as SEMI E70;
• reticle  handling  documents  such  as  SEMI  E100
which  specifies  a  reticle  SMIF  pod  for  6-inch  or
230 mm reticles based on SEMI E19.4; or
• safety documents such as SEMI S2, SEMI S8,
SEMI  S11  and  an  upcoming  Safety  Guideline  for
Unmanned Transport Vehicle (UTV) Systems.
3. 2  Physical  Interfaces  and  Carriers  Only  —  This
document   also   does   not   cover   standards   that   were
generated by committees other than the SEMI Physical
Interfaces  and  Carriers  Committee,  even  though  such
standards  may  be  specific  to  300  mm.  For  example,
standards not described here include:
• Information  and  Control  documents  such  as  SEMI
E82; and
• Silicon  documents  such  as  SEMI  M1.15,  SEMI
M8, and SEMI M28 (Developmental Wafers).

6  Description of the Standards
6. 1  Overview — Figure 2 shows roughly what most of
the SEMI standards for 300 mm physical interfaces and
carriers  specify.    However,  this  picture  is  greatly  over-
simplified.    For  example,  a  front-opening  shipping  box
(FOSB)  compliant  with  SEMI  M31  (with  its  thicker
door)  generally  cannot  be  opened  by  equipment  load
ports  that  are  compliant  with  SEMI  E63.    Also,  a  wire
link  to  an  OHT  for  the  carrier  handoff  parallel  I/O  can
also    be    located    at    the    top    of    the    equipment.
Furthermore,    the    atmospheric    wafer    handler    for
emptying the carrier will generally be different from the
wafer  handler  used  in  the  vacuum  environment  of  the
central handler module of a cluster tool.
6. 2  Kinematic Coupling — The foundational document
of  the  SEMI  standards  for  300  mm  physical  interfaces
and    carriers    is    SEMI    E57    which    specifies    the
mechanical  couplings  used  to  ergonomically  align  and
precisely   support   300   mm   wafer   carriers.      The
kinematic coupling consists of three pins that mate with
grooves  on  the  bottom  of  the  wafer  carrier  (which  are
not specified) for physical alignment and support.  Most
of  the  dimensions  in  the  SEMI  standards  for  300  mm
physical  interfaces  and  carriers  are  determined  with
respect to the three orthogonal datum planes defined in
SEMI E57: the horizontal datum plane, the facial datum
plane, and the bilateral datum plane.  Such a kinematic
coupling can be used at several interfaces, including:
• between a FOUP or cassette and an equipment load
port or vehicle nest,
• between a transport cassette and a box, and
• between  a  process  cassette  or  quartz  boat  and  the
floor of a process chamber.</p><p>E21.1 (Cluster-Tool

6. 3  Wafer  Carriers  —  SEMI  E1.9  and  SEMI  E47.1
specify the carriers used to transport and store 300 mm
wafers  in  an  IC  manufacturing  facility.  SEMI  E47.1
specifies   the   outside   features   of   the   front-opening
unified  pod  (FOUP).    The  inside  features  of  the  FOUP
are  specified  in  SEMI  E1.9,  which  also  specifies  the
open cassette.  Both standards specify carriers that hold
either  13  or  25  wafers.  SEMI  M31  specifies  the  front-
opening  shipping  box  (FOSB)  used  to  transport  and
ship  300  mm  wafers.    SEMI  E103  specifies  a  system
that  includes  a  box  that  holds  only  one  wafer  and  that
fits  onto  an  adapter  mechanism  called  a  single-wafer
interface   (SWIF).      This   system   appears   to   the
equipment to be a 300 mm FOUP (except that only the
volume around the middle wafer may be accessible).
6. 4  Equipment  Load  Ports  —  SEMI  E15.1  specifies
the carrier load ports at the front of 300 mm process or
metrology  equipment  (or  stockers).    In  addition,  the
substrate  port  that  opens  a  FOUP  door  is  specified  in
SEMI E62 (FIMS).  At the floor below each load port is
a  cart  docking  interface  exclusion  volume  specified  in
SEMI  E64;  this  volume  can  contain  a  PGV  docking
flange  as  specified  in  SEMI  E83.  SEMI  E63  (BOLTS-
M)  or  SEMI  E92  (BOLTS-Light)  or  both  standards
specify the mechanical interface between the main part
of    a    process    or    metrology    tool    and    the    box
opener/loader unit that opens FOUPs and presents them
to the tool wafer handler for unloading and loading 300
mm  wafers.  Also  associated  with  each  load  port  is  a
wire  or  optical  link  (from  the  equipment  to  the  AMHS
carrier  delivery  system)  specified  in  SEMI  E84    which
is  the  300  mm  version  of  SEMI  E23.    SEMI  E99  and
SEMI E99.1 specify the electronics and communication
interface  between  a  carrier  ID  reader/writer  and  the
equipment    controller.    SEMI    E101    specifies    the
functional structure model and component behavior for
the entire equipment front-end module (EFEM).  SEMI
E110 specifies the placement of indicators and switch.
6. 5  Cluster-Tools   —   SEMI   standards   for   300   mm
cluster  tools  include  SEMI  E22.1,  SEMI  E21.1,  SEMI
E26.1, and SEMI E25.
6. 6  AMHS  —  SEMI  standards  for  automated  material
handling systems (AMHS) include SEMI E85.
6. 7  Equipment   Volume   and   Weight   —   SEMI   E72
specifies  limits  on  the  footprint,  height,  and  weight  of
equipment  for  300  mm  fabs.  Separate  limits  are  given
for the parts of the equipment in the main fab and in the
sub-fab.   Separate   limits   are   also   given   for   the
equipment after it is installed and for the components of
the equipment as it is moved into the fab.
6. 8  Back-End  Standards  —  SEMI  G74  specifies  the
tape frames used for 300 mm wafers between the dicing
process   and   the   die-bonding   process.      SEMI   G77
specifies  the  mechanical  features  of  a  metal  or  plastic
frame cassette used for framed 300 mm wafers between
the   wafer   mounting   process   and   the   die-bonding
process.    Future  standards  may  also  specify  the  carrier
for thinned 300 mm wafers and the load port for back-
end process or metrology equipment.
6. 9  Standards  of  Uncertain  Use  —  Some  SEMI  300
mm  standards  that  passed  balloting  have  a  scope  of
application  or  extent  of  use  that  is  yet  to  be  fully
determined.  Such standards include SEMI M29 which
specifies a manually-opening shipping box for 300 mm
wafers.    In  the  other  SEMI  300  mm  standards  are  also
some  options  of  uncertain  use  such  as  bottom-opening
pods and pods with removable cassettes.
7  Application of Standards to Products
7. 1  One-Sided  Interface  Specifications  —  The  SEMI
standards  for  300  mm  physical  interfaces  and  carriers
are intended to set an appropriate level of specification
that places minimal limits on innovation while ensuring
modularity  and  inter-changeability  between  different
types of products. To accomplish this, only one side of
each  mechanical  interface  (between  different  types  of
products)   is   specified,   leaving   the   supplier   of   the
product on the other side of the interface more freedom
to improve their product.  For example, only the bottom
half  of  the  kinematic  coupling  (the  pin)  is  specified  by
SEMI E57 so that suppliers can be flexible in designing
wafer  carrier  grooves  that  can  mate  with  it.    Table  1
shows  which  standards  apply  to  each  type  of  product
and shows which side of the interface is specified:
• “D” indicates if the standard directly specifies that
type  of  product  (by  specifying  that  product’s  side
of the relevant interface).
• “I” indicates if the standard indirectly specifies that
type of product (by specifying the other side of the
relevant interface).
7. 2  Carriers — A FOUP is directly specified by SEMI
E47.1  (for  its  outside  features  not  including  the  door)
and  by  SEMI  E1.9  (for  its  inside  features).  The  FOUP
is  indirectly  specified  by  SEMI  E57  (for  its  kinematic
coupling grooves) and by SEMI E62 (for its FIMS door
interface).  Thus,  if  a  FOUP  door  fails  to  open  or  close
correctly on any load port that complies with SEMI E57
and   SEMI   E62,   that   FOUP   is   in   violation   of   the
standards.  The wafer support function of all of the 300
mm  carriers  is  specified  directly  (by  specifying  where
the  wafers  must  be  located  rather  than  specifying  the
shape  and  location  of  the  supports),  so  the  300  mm
wafer standards indirectly specify the carriers.
7. 3  Stockers —  A  carrier  stocker  is  directly  specified
by  SEMI  E57  (for  the  kinematic  coupling  pins  on  its
shelves,   if   any,   and   on   its   manual/AGV/RGV   and</p><p>SEMI E106-1104 © SEMI 2000, 2004 6
interbay    load    ports),    by    SEMI    E15.1    (for    its
manual/AGV/RGV  load  ports),  by  SEMI  E85  (for  its
interbay  load  ports),  by  SEMI  E84  (for  its  carrier
handoff  parallel  I/O  at  either  kind  of  load  port)  and  by
SEMI  E64  (for  the  cart  docking  interface  exclusion
volume below each manual/AGV/RGV load port).  The
carrier  stocker  is  indirectly  specified  by  the  carrier
standards (for the volume required to store and transfer
the carriers).
7. 4  Carrier  ID  —  A  carrier  ID  reader/writer  unit  is
directly specified by a future standard that specifies the
electronics   and   communication   interface   between   a
carrier  ID  reader/writer  and  the  equipment  controller.
The  carrier  ID  reader/writer  unit  is  indirectly  specified
by  the  carrier  standards  (which  specify  reserved  areas
for   carrier   ID   tags)   and   by   SEMI   E15.1   (for   its
exclusion volume in each load port).
7. 5  Load Port and Carrier Handler Modules — A box
opener/loader (the module on a piece of equipment that
includes  load  ports  and  carrier  handling)  is  directly
specified by SEMI E57 (for the kinematic coupling pins
on  the  load  port  and  on  its  shelves  if  it  includes  an
internal buffer in addition to its fixed buffer), by SEMI
E15.1  (for  its  load  ports),  by  SEMI  E62  (for  its  FIMS
door  interface),  by  SEMI  E84  (for  its  carrier  handoff
parallel   I/O),   by   SEMI   E64   (for   the   cart   docking
interface  exclusion  volume  below  each  load  port),  by
SEMI  E72  (for  its  limits  on  footprint,  height,  and
weight),   and   by   SEMI   E110   (for   indicator/switch
placement).    The  module  is  indirectly  specified  by  the
carrier  standards  (for  the  volume  required  to  store  and
transfer  the  carriers)  and  by  SEMI  E63  and/or  SEMI
E92 (for the mechanical interface to the main part of the
process   or   metrology   equipment   that   contains   the
substrate handler).
7. 6  Main  Part  of  Process  or  Metrology  Equipment  —
The   main   part   of   process   or   metrology   equipment
(including the substrate handler) is directly specified by
SEMI   E63   and/or   SEMI   E92   (for   the   mechanical
interface  to  the  module  that  includes  load  ports  and
carrier  handling)  and  by  SEMI  E72  (for  its  limits  on
footprint, height, and weight).  The substrate handler is
indirectly  specified  by  SEMI  E1.9  (for  the  features
inside  most  carriers)  and  it  is  recommended  to  follow
the   direct   specifications   in   SEMI   E22.1   (which
specifies cluster-tool end effectors).
7. 7  Material  Handling  Systems  —  A  carrier  transport
vehicle  is  directly  specified  by  SEMI  E57  (for  the
kinematic coupling pins on the carrier nest, if any) and
by  SEMI  E84  (for  its  carrier  handoff  parallel  I/O,  if
any).  The AMHS system is indirectly specified by the
carrier  standards  (for  the  volume  required  to  hold  and
transfer  the  carriers),  by  SEMI  E15.1  (for  equipment
load ports), by SEMI E85 (for stocker load ports, if it is
an OHT), by SEMI E72 (to allow for equipment height,
if it is an OHT), and by SEMI E64 and SEMI E83 (for
the  cart  docking  interface  exclusion  volume  and  the
PGV    docking    flange,    respectively,    below    each
equipment load port, if it is a floor based vehicle).</p><p>SEMI E106-1104 © SEMI 2000, 2004 7

TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC
CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS
CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY
This test method was technically approved by the Global Metrics Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  European  Equipment  Automation  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  European  Regional
Standards  Committee  on  December  20,  2000.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  February  2001;  to  be
published March 2001.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1   The  purpose  of  this  standard  is   to  define  a  test
method for the determination of the outgassing organic
contamination  from  minienvironments  used  for  storage
and transport of wafers using gas chromatography/mass
spectroscopy (GC/MS).</li><li>2   This  test  method  is  intended  as   an  alternative  to
SEMI  E46.  The  main  difference  between  SEMI  E46
and  this  document  is  that  SEMI  E46  defines  a  test
method  which  is  based  on  ion  mobility  spectroscopy
(IMS)   as   the   measurement   technique   while   this
standard    is    based    on    gas    chromatography/mass
spectroscopy  in  combination  with  thermal  desorption.
Additionally,  this  test  method  provides  a  procedure  for
testing   the   outgassing   of   organic   compounds   in   a
complete  minienvironment.  The  results  of  SEMI  E46
and this document are given in different units.
2  Scope</li><li>1   The  test  method  provided  in  th is  document  is
applicable   to   the   assessment   of   the   outgassing   of
organic contamination from minienvironments.</li><li>2   Gas  chromatography/mass  spe ctroscopy  is  chosen
as   the   method   to   determine   organic   contamination
because  it  is  commonly  used  for  characterization  and
quantification  of  organic  compounds.  In  combination
with  thermal  desorption,  it  provides  a  method  for  the
identification  of  organic  compounds  in  the  atmosphere
(i.e.,  inside  the  minienvironment)  as  well  as  directly
from  source  materials,  and  transferred  contaminants.
This method can also be used to evaluate materials and
processes used in semiconductor industry.</li><li>3  This test method is based on A STM F1982.</li><li>4   This  standard  does  not  purport   to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1   The  test  methodologies,  metric s  and  applications
provided  in  this  standard  are  limited  by  the  following
constraints:</li><li>1.1   The  specific  recovery  of  comp ounds  by  the
proposed  standard  method  strongly  depends  on  the
setup  of  the  apparatus  used.  This  has  been  taken  into
account  by  the  use  of  the  “reference-cocktail”,  see
Section 9.2.</li><li>2  Identification of the source of  organic compounds
inside  the  minienvironment  is  out  of  the  scope  of  this
test   method.   For   a   procedure   for   the   analysis   of
outgassing     organic     compounds     from     individual
materials using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy,
see IDEMA M11-99.</li><li>3  This test method does not prov ide a procedure how
to  use  the  obtained  data  for  assessing  the  risks  that
come from individual compounds.

5  Terminology
5. 1   analytical  environment  —   env ironment  where  all
analytical measurements are taking place.
5. 2  headspace sampling — in this  standard defined as:
collecting  volatile  organic  compounds  in  an  enclosed
volume  by  means  of  a  silicon  wafer  or  silicon  wafer
chips.
5. 3  minienvironment  —  A  localize d  environment  for

any active movement of test specimens.
5. 6   thermal  desorption  tube  —  An alytical  equipment
capable  of  collecting  organic  compounds  of  interest
(i.e., adsorbent filled glass tube).
5. 7  wafer — Object made of semi conducting material
to     be     processed,     handled     or     stored     in     the
minienvironment  to  be  tested  (i.e.,  prime  or  processed
silicon wafer).
6  Summary of Method
6. 1  This test method comprises sto rage tests of wafers
in  minienvironments  under  static  storage  conditions.
The contamination is directly measured from the silicon
wafer surface. Three important aspects are covered:
a) Contamination due to the minienvironment alone,
b) Contamination from the use of minienvironments for
wafer processing, and
c)  Contamination  from  future  materials  to  be  used  in
semiconductor technology.
6. 2   The  setup  for  each  test  compri ses  an  analytical
equipment  in  the  analytical  environment  as  well  as  a
test    equipment    in    the    test    environment.    Each
environment has to fulfill the following requirements:
6. 2.1  Analytical Environment — sha ll be clean enough
with    respect    to    airborne    organic    contamination:
recommendation  is  less  than  100  pptM  for  organic
compounds  with  boiling  points  &gt;  150°C  (Class  MC-
100, according to SEMI F21).
6. 2.2  Test Environment — shall equ al the environment
in which the test specimen will be used.
6. 3   Silicon  wafers  are  placed  in  th e  minienvironment
or  used  for  headspace  sampling  experiments.  These
wafer  samples  are  then  analyzed  by  gas  chromatogra-
phy/mass  spectrometry  to  determine  the  amount  of
contaminants.
6. 4   The  wafers  or  wafer  chips  to  b e  used  for  the  test
method  are  decontaminated  as  described  in  ASTM
F1982 for bare silicon wafers. The surface condition of
the   wafer   (hydrophobic   or   hydrophilic)   has   to   be
adjusted  in  a  reproducible  way  and  has  to  be  the  same
for all comparative measurements.
6. 5   The  wafer  or  the  wafer  chips  a re  placed  in  the
minienvironment    and    are    left    there    under    static
conditions for the chosen static storage time (depending
on the intended use of the minienvironment to be tested,
a  time  between  1  h  and  28  d  may  be  used).  When
loaded into the minienvironment the wafer may have a
temperature  which  reflects  production  circumstances
(i.e., 80°C when unloading from furnace processes). In
some   situations   wafers   may   be   exposed   to   severe
thermal  conditions.  The  minienvironment  should  be
evaluated under the conditions exposed to. Be sure that
the   material   to   be   tested   does   not   undergo   phase
transitions under the chosen temperature conditions.
6. 6   After  the  static  storage  test  per iod,  the  wafer  is
returned  to  the  analytical  equipment  and  the  organic
contamination on the wafer is measured immediately.
6. 7   The  quantitative  value  for  the   total  amount  of
outgassed and adsorbed organics from the minienviron-
ment   is   calculated   as   the   difference   between   the
detected  amount  of  contamination  on  a  blank  sample
vs. the amount on the exposed sample.
7  Interferences
7. 1   The  presence  of  organic  conta mination  in  the
atmosphere  of  the  test  environment  may  lead  to  a
significant  contribution  to  the  detected  total  amount  of
organic  compounds  on  the  test  wafers  or  wafer  chips.
Care  has  to  be  taken  when  subtracting  the  blank  value
from    the    test    value.    Transport    times    from    test
environment  to  analytical  environment  have  to  be  as
short as possible.
8  Apparatus
8. 1  For the analysis of organic com pounds on wafers a
gas  chromatography/mass  spectroscopy  apparatus  with
thermal     desorption     unit     is     required:     A     gas
chromatography   (GC)   instrument,   which   utilizes   a
capillary  column  to  separate  a  wide  variety  of  organic
compounds, combined with mass spectrometer (MS). A
thermal desorption unit is used to desorb organics from
sample  thermal  desorption  tubes  and  collect  them  in  a
trap. Two types of trapping may be used:</p><p>SEMI E108-0301 © SEMI 20013
a) cooling the trap down to a minimum of -150°C does
not require any adsorbent (glass wool may be used) or
b)  a  Tenax®  filled  trap  has  to  be  cooled  down  to  a
minimum of -25°C.
8. 1.1  The thermal desorption unit is  coupled to the gas
chromatography  instrument  via  a  heated  transfer  line.
This  apparatus  may  be  used  directly  for  the  desorption
from  wafer  chips  which  are  put  in  empty  glass  (or
stainless steel) thermo desorption tubes (method A).
8. 1.2    A   desorption   unit   for   complete    wafers   is
specified  in  ASTM  F1982.  In  this  case  sample  thermal
desorption tubes packed with adsorbent have to be used
to  trap  compounds  desorbed  from  the  wafer.  These
thermal   desorption   tubes   are   analyzed   within   the
thermal desorption unit (method B).
8. 2   The  analysis  of  outgassing  org anic  contamination
from minienvironments requires an extremely sensitive
analytical  equipment.  Recovery  and  limit  of  detection
for   the   different   classes   of   compounds   must   be
evaluated carefully in order to ensure reliable results.
9  Reagents and Materials
9. 1   For  the  materials  used  for  hand ling  and  transport
of  wafers  clean,  decontaminated  equipment  has  to  be
used, e.g. tweezers heated in a propane flame. Refer to
the  reagent  and  materials  described  in  SEMI  E46  and
ASTM F1982.
9. 2  Test  Mixture  —  For  the  calibra tion  of  equipment
and the quantification of the amount of contamination a
test  mixture  (”cocktail”)  is  used.  This  mixture  was
chosen  in  order  to  give  an  ”average”  over  typical
substance  classes  present  in  semiconductor  production
lines,  which  have  high  sticking  factors  to  the  wafer
surface.  The  response  factor  of  the  MS-detection  for
organics  varies  significantly.  As  this  is  true  for  all
contaminants,  the  method  gives  a  realistic  trustworthy
quantitative correlation to a ”typical average compound
mixture” of contaminants on wafer surfaces.
9. 3  Preparation of Test Mixture
9. 3.1    The   mixture   consists   of   triethy l   phosphate,
ε-caprolactam, palmitic acid and diethylhexyl phthalate
each    0.5    μg/μl    in    isooctane    (as    solvent).    The
preparation has to be done according to SEMI E46.
NOTE 2: A  similar  test  mixture  is  suggested  by  the  working
group WG 031 of the Institute for Environmental Science and
Technology (IEST)
10  Safety Precautions
10. 1   All  preparation  and  analytical   work  has  to  be
done according to local safety regulations.
11  Preparation of Minienviro nment and
Sample
11. 1   Minienvironment  —  The  minie nvironment  to  be
tested  has  to  be  used  as  received  from  the  supplier.  A
cleaning  step  can  be  added  but  there  must  be  no
contribution   from   the   cleaning   procedure   to   the
outgassing     of     organic     compounds     from     the
minienvironment.   The   cleaning   method   has   to   be
defined by the supplier or agreed upon between supplier
and user of the tested minienvironment.
11. 2  Sample — The wafers shall be   made organic-free
before  using  them  to  monitor  organic  contamination.
The  surface  condition  of  the  wafer  (hydrophobic  or
hydrophilic)  has  to  be  adjusted  in  a  reproducible  way
and  has  to  be  the  same  for  comparative  measurements.
Refer to SEMI E46 and ASTM F1982.
12  Procedure
12. 1    The   procedure   described   below    is   used   for
obtaining  the  baseline  value  of  the  method  (method
blank)  as  well  as  the  test  value  for  outgassing  organic
compounds  of  the  minienvironment  within  a  defined
static storage time (storage time t
S
= 1 h - 28 d).
12. 1.1  Choose that static storage time  according to the
intended   use   of   the   minienvironment   (i.e.,   if   the
maximum  sit  time  of  wafers  in  a  process  where  the
minienvironment  is  to  be  used  is  4  h  then  choose  a
static  storage  time  of  4  h).  If  no  static  storage  time
related  to  processes  can  be  defined,  a  recommended
value for the first static storage time is 1 day.
NOTE 3: Composition of adsorbed compounds may vary with
static storage time.
12. 2  For transport store the wafers o r wafer chips used
for  testing  in  decontaminated,  organic-free  petri-dishes
wrapped  in  organic-free  aluminum  foil.  Refer  to  SEMI
E46.
12. 3  Loading Procedure
12. 3.1    For   tests   at   room   temperature :   open   a
minienvironment   to   be   tested   and   load   it   with   a
decontaminated  wafer  using  decontaminated  handling
tools  (i.e.,  tweezers).  Default  storage  location  is  the
center    slot    of    the    minienvironment.    Close    the
minienvironment.  Leave  the  minienvironment  closed
for the chosen static storage time.
12. 3.2   For  tests  at  elevated  temperatu res  using  a
wafer  furnace:  place  the  decontaminated  wafers  in  a
clean  furnace  used  for  production  processes  and  heat
the  wafers  under  inert  gas  to  a  temperature  &gt;  120°C.
Turn  off  the  heating.  When  the  temperature  of  the
furnace      has      reached      (90±10)°C      open      the
minienvironment to be tested and fully load it with the</p><p>SEMI E108-0301 © SEMI 20014
hot      wafers      from      the      furnace.      Close      the
minienvironment.  Leave  it  closed  for  the  chosen  static
storage  time.  For  analysis  use  only  one  wafer.  Default
wafer is the one in the center slot.
12. 3.3   For  tests  at  elevated  temperatu res  using  a
heating   chamber:   open   the   minienvironment   to   be
tested  and  load  it  with  a  decontaminated  wafer  using
decontaminated  handling  tools  (i.e.,  tweezers).  Default
location  is  the  center  slot.  Close  the  minienvironment.
Wrap    the    minienvironment    with    decontaminated
aluminum  foil.  Place  the  minienvironment  in  an  inert
and clean heating chamber heated to 70°C. Leave it for
1  h  and  then  remove  it  from  the  heating  chamber  and
place  it  at  the  test  minienvironment.  Leave  it  there
closed for the chosen static storage time.
NOTE 4: The  purpose  of  the  aluminum  foil  is  to  prevent
direct  contact  between  the  recirculating  hot  air  inside  the
heating chamber and the minienvironment.
12. 4   Unloading  Procedure  —   Open   the  minienviron-
ment   and   unload   the   wafer   using   decontaminated
handling  tools  into  decontaminated  petri-dishes  and
wrap  them  into  organic-free  aluminum  foil.  Transport
the  wafer  immediately  to  the  measurement  equipment
and  analyze  the  organic  contamination  on  the  wafer
according to the standard ASTM F1982.
12. 5  Method Blank — Perform the  test sequence using
a  container  made  completely  of  glass  or  quartz  instead
of  the  minienvironment.  Use  the  same  static  storage
time for the method blank but perform this blank test at
room     temperature.     The     container     has     to     be
decontaminated  with  respect  to  organics  inside  by  heat
treatment (refer to SEMI E46). With this blank method
the baseline contribution from the cleanroom air on the
adsorption   of   organic   contamination   on   the   silicon
wafer surface is determined.
12. 6   Analyzing  Procedure  —  Put  th e  wafer  or  wafer
chips   in   the   precleaned   desorption   unit   or   thermal
desorption tube and heat it for 10 min to a minimum of
275°C  (but  400°C  is  better).  The  desorbed  contam-
inants  have  to  be  trapped  directly  with  the  cold  trap  of
the   thermodesorption   unit   (method   A)   or   first   by
adsorbent  filled  desorption  tubes  and  then  by  the  cold
trap  (method  B).  Desorption  parameters  for  adsorbent
filled desorption tube and cold trap may be taken from
ASTM F1982 (see also Section 12.6.1).
12. 6.1   The  substances  desorbed  shou ld  be  separated
by   an   appropriate   column   temperature   program.   A
recommended    temperature    program    for    standard
analysis   uses   a   polydimethylsiloxane/polydiphenyl-
siloxane (95/5) coated column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25
μm),  heated  from  50
o
C  to  250
o
C  at  a  rate  of  10
o
C/min
followed  by  a  temperature  hold  at  250
o
C  for  10  min.
Column  flow  should  be  about  1  ml/min  He  at  constant
flow.
12. 6.2   All  parameters  (thermo  desorp tion  unit,  gas
chromatograph,  mass  spectrometer)  should  be  set  to
yield  the  recommended  detection  limits  and  recovery
rates (see Calibration Procedure Section 13.2).
12. 7   Materials  Testing  —  Materials   testing  can  be
done,  using  the  sample  preparation  described  in  SEMI
E46,  but  using  gas  chromatography/mass  spectroscopy
instead  of  IMS  for  the  analysis  of  contaminants  on  the
test wafers or wafer chips.
12. 8   Perform  the  procedure  for  cali bration,  method
blank   and   test   (including   sample   preparation)   in
triplicate  in  order  to  obtain  mean  value  and  standard
deviation for the analysis.
13  Calibration and System P e rformance
13. 1   Calibration  —  The  test  mixtur e  (2  μl  liquid,
equals  1  μg  of  each  substance;  see  Section  9.3)  is
applied  to  the  wafer  or  wafer  chips  as  described  in
SEMI  E46.  The  so  produced  reference  wafer  or  wafer
chips are handled in the same way as the samples. That
means, they are put in the precleaned desorption unit or
thermal   desorption   tube   and   heated   for   10   min   to
minimum  275°C  (but  400°C  is  better)  and  so  on  as
described in Section 12.6.
13. 2     System    Performance     —     All     pa rameters
(thermodesorption    unit,    gas    chromatograph,    mass
spectrometer)   should   be   set   to   yield   the   specified
detection  limits  and  recovery  rates  (method  B)  for  the
components  of  the  reference  mixture.  The  limit  of
detection  (3σ)  must  equal  or  be  better  than  250  ng  for
each  of  the  four  reference  substances.  The  standard
deviation   (inaccuracy)   of   the   calibration   must   be
≤  10%.  Sample  measurements  are  not  allowed,  unless
these     requirements     are     fulfilled.     For     sample
measurements    the    same    parameters    as    for    the
calibration measurements have to be used.
14  Quantification
14. 1  Integration  —  After  the  analys is  measure  the
surface  area  (A
s
)  of  the  tested  wafer  or  wafer  chips.
Summing     up     all     the     peak     areas     from     gas
chromatography/mass  spectroscopy  chromatogram  of
the  wafer  or  wafer  chips  gives  the  total  integral  (I
s
).
Determine the total integral (I
b
) of the blank wafer and
the   total   integral   of   the   four   peaks   of   the   gas
chromatography/mass  spectroscopy  chromatogram  of
the test mixture (I
r
) with the same technique.</p><p>SEMI E108-0301 © SEMI 20015

GUIDELINE FOR INDICATOR PLACEMENT ZONE AND SWITCH
PLACEMENT VOLUME OF LOAD PORT OPERATION INTERFACE FOR
300 mm LOAD PORTS
This guideline was technically approved by the Global Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee and is the
direct responsibility of the Japanese Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee. Current edition approved by
the Japanese Regional Standards Committee on July 19, 2002.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> October
2002; to be published November 2002.  Originally published November 2001.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1    This  guideline  defines  the  zones  and  volumes  in
which   load   port   status   indicators   and   load   port
operation  switches  should  be  placed.    The  purpose  of
this guideline is to give a similarity in the placement of
them  on  a  300  mm  load  port.    This  guideline  only
defines  the  zones  and  volumes  for  them  and  the  exact
placement of them within these zone and volumes are at
the direction of the load port suppliers.</li><li>2      The   zones   or   volumes   may   be   defined   more
precisely  by  standardization  improvement  on  load  port
design  and  good  unification  of  load  port  operation
among  device  manufactures.  This  guideline  may  be
improved to be a specification after this effort.
2  Scope</li><li>1      This   guideline   defines   following   recommended
specifications for 300 mm load port.
• Indicator placement zone in which load port status
indicators should be placed.
• Switch   placement   volume   in   which   load   port
operation switch should be placed.</li><li>2    This  guideline  covers  the  specifications  for  both
fixed buffer equipment and internal buffer equipment.</li><li>3    This  guideline  is  intended  to  set  an  appropriate
level  of  specification  that  places  minimal  limits  on
innovation    while    ensuring    modularity    and    inter-
changeability  at  all  mechanical  interfaces.  Only  the
physical  interfaces  for  the  load  port  are  specified;  no
materials requirements, micro-contamination limits, use
of or logic associated with the defined physical features
are given in this specification.</li><li>4    This  guideline  does  not  purport  to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  guideline  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.

4  Terminology</li><li>1  Definitions</li><li>1.1  bilateral  datum  plane  —  a  vertical  plane  that
bisects  the  wafers  and  that  is  perpendicular  to  both  the
horizontal and facial datum planes (as defined in SEMI
E57).</li><li>1.2  facial datum plane — a vertical plane that bisects
the  wafers  and  that  is  parallel  to  the  front  side  of  the
carrier (where wafers are removed or inserted).  On tool
load  ports,  it  is  also  parallel  to  the  load  face  plane
specified in SEMI E15 on the side of the tool where the
carrier  is  loaded  and  unloaded  (as  defined  in  SEMI
E57).</li><li>1.3  fixed  buffer  equipment  —  production  equipment
that has only fixed load ports and no internal buffer for
carrier  storage.  Substrates  are  loaded  and  unloaded
directly  from  the  carrier  at  the  load  port  for  processing
(as defined in SEMI E87).</li></ol><p>SEMI E110-1102 © SEMI 2001, 2002 2
4. 1.4  horizontal datum plane  —  a  horizontal  plane  from  which  projects  the  kinematic-coupling  pins  on  which  the
carrier sits. On tool load ports, it is at the load height specified in SEMI E15 and might not be physically realized as
a surface (as defined in SEMI E57).
4. 1.5  indicator placement zone — a zone in which load port status indicators are placed.
4. 1.6  internal buffer equipment — equipment that uses an internal buffer (as defined in SEMI E87).
4. 1.7  load port operation interface — any indicator (e.g. lamp, LED) to visualize status information of a load port
to an operator and/or any switch to be used for manual handoff operation.
4. 1.8  load port operation switch — any switch to be used for manual handoff operation.
4. 1.9  load port status indicator — any indicator (e.g. lamp, LED) to visualize status information of a load port to an
operator.
4. 1.10  switch placement volume — a volume in which load port operation switch is placed.
5  Requirements
5. 1  Indicator placement zone
5. 1.1  Indicator  Placement  Zone  for  a  Load  Port  per  SEMI  E15.1  Option  1  —  It  is  recommended  that  load  port
status indicators should be positioned within a zone given by x400, z400, and z401.  The exact placement of them
within  this  zone  is  at  the  direction  of  the  load  port  supplier.    They  may  be  located  at  or  behind  (away  from  the
operator) the equipment boundary.  Clearances required by SEMI E15.1 cannot be violated.
NOTE  2:  The  indicator  placement  zone  is  not  an  exclusion  zone.    No  assumption  can  be  made  that  this  zone  needs  to  be  kept
empty  by  the  load  port  supplier.    Furthermore,  no  assumption  can  be  made  that  a  load  port  must  have  a  physical  surface
representing the indicator placement zone.</p><p>x400=237.5
