This appendix is derived from presentations made to\nthe SEMI Surface Analysis Task Force.\nA1-1.1  The purpose of this appendix is to describe the\nESCA  (sometimes  referred  to  as  X-Ray  Photoelectron\nSpectroscopy    (XPS))    technique    and    explain    the\ninterpretation  of  the  depth  profile  analysis  with  respect\nto  the  structure  and  composition  of  the  passive  oxide\nlayer  on  stainless  steel.    The  effect  of  the  depth  of\nanalysis  on  the  measured  chromium  to  iron  ratio,  the\noxide   thickness,   and   the   depth   of   enrichment   is\ndiscussed.

The  surface  of  interest  is\nilluminated   with   X-rays,   typically   Al   k\u03b1 radiation,\nwhich  has  a  well-defined  energy  of  1486.6  eV.  When\nan  x-ray  photon  and  an  electron  interact,  the  electron\nadsorbs  all  of  the  energy  of  the  photon,  1486.5  eV;  it\ncannot  react  with  it  partially.    The  electron  then  has\nsufficient  energy  to  leave  the  atom  and  move  into  the\nmatrix.    The  electron\u2019s  energy  in  the  matrix  is  1486.6\neV  minus  its  binding  energy  to  the  atom  from  which  it\nescaped. Its binding energy is indicative of the element\nor  compound  from  which  it  came  and  the  orbital  from\nwhich  it  was  removed.    Such  an  electron  is  termed  a\n\u201cphotoelectron\u201d.\nA1-1.3          In     a     typical     ESCA     instrument,     a\nmonochromatic beam of x-rays is focused at a point of\ninterest  on  a  surface.  A  cloud  of  electrons  is  generated\nat  the  surface  by  the  x-rays.    This  electron  cloud  is\nmade  up  of  secondary  electrons,  Auger  electrons  and\nphotoelectrons.   (NOTE:   The   generation   of   Auger\nelectrons   is   a   byproduct   of   the   process.

Photoelectrons    and    Auger    electrons    are\ngenerated  all  through  this  illuminated  volume.  The\ninelastic mean free path (IMFP) of an electron in a solid\nis  the  mean  distance  through  the  solid  that  an  electron\ncan travel before losing some of its energy (suffering an\ninelastic  interaction).    The  IMFP  is  a  function  of  the\nelectron\u2019s  energy  and  the  matrix  through  which  it  is\ntraveling.  Electrons  with  an  energy  of  approximately  1\nkeV have an IMFP of about 10 \xc5.  That means that a 1\nkeV  electron  will  travel,  on  average,  10  \xc5  before\ninteracting  with  the  matrix  and  giving  up  some  of  its\nenergy.    In  other  words  it  will  be  scattered  to  lower\nenergy  and  will  not  be  part  of  the  photoelectron  or\nAuger  electron  line  for  its  element.    The  IMFP  is  a\nstatistical parameter and an electron may travel several\nIMFPs  before  having  a  collision.

Although ESCA\nand Auger are considered surface analytical tools, their\ndepth of analysis is on the order of 50 \xc5, or about one\nto  two  times  the  depth  of  the  oxide  film  found  on  a\ntypical passivated stainless steel surface.\nFigure A1-3\nThe electron escape depth of low energy electrons in\nsome metals.\nA1-1.6 Depth  of  Analysis  Function  \u2014  There  has  been\nsome discussion with respect to the \u201cDepth of Analysis\nFunction\u201d.  There  is  one  school  that  believes  that  it  is  5\nIMFPs  and  another  that  uses  3  IMFPs.    These  two\nfunctions will be referred to as 5\u03bb and 3\u03bb respectively.\nIt  will  be  seen  that  it  makes  little  difference  which\nfunction  is  used  even  though  the  depth  of  the  oxide\nfilms  is  of  the  order  of  the  functions.    These  functions\nare seen in Figure A1-4, which shows the proportion of\nthe  total  signal  generated  from  each  depth  below  the\nsurface.

Such\ntests     may     include     performance     demonstrations,\ndemonstrations  of  reliability  criteria,  and  achievement\nof   purity   standards.   Such   tests   are   the   basis   for\nacceptance  or  rejection  by  the  purchaser  against  a  pre-\nnegotiated  set  of  criteria  for  the  performance  of  the\nsystem.\n5. 4  Qualification Testing \uf8e7 Quali fication testing may\ninclude tests for resistivity, temperature, pressure, TOC,\ndissolved  oxygen,  particle  levels,  bacteria,  total  silica,\ndissolved silica, non-volatile residue, ions, and metals.\n5. 5  Monitoring \uf8e7  UPW  systems  a re  monitored  for\ncontinuing  performance  against  desired  and  achievable\nlevels  of  quality.

The    guaranteed    performance    is\nestablished  in  advance  between  the  UPW  equipment\nmanufacturer  and  the  system  owner.  Both  qualification\ntesting   and   monitoring   testing   use   the   guaranteed\nspecifications to determine the parameters and levels of\npurity to be tested.\n5. 7   Recycle/Reclaim  Opportunitie s\n\uf8e7 There  can  be\nseveral  opportunities  for  using  water  within  a  UPW\nsystem,  and  should  be  recognized  during  the  design\nphase  when  possible.  Examples  are;  use  of  1\nst\npass\nreject  for  cooling  tower  make-up  water,  returning  UF\nreject  to  Primary  or  Feed  water  Tank,  re-use  of  last\nstage  rinse  waters  as  UPW  for  lower  grade  use  areas,\ni.e.,  CMP,  isolation  of  CMP  waste  stream,  for  possible\nreclaim/reuse.\n6  Source Water\n6. 1   Raw  Water\n\uf8e7 is  the  raw  mate rial  from  which\nUPW  is  made.    Untreated  raw  water  is  natural  water\nthat is obtained from a surface source such as a lake or\nriver, or from a ground water source.  The raw water to\na  UPW  system  is  most  frequently  treated  Municipal\nDrinking Water.\n6. 2   Municipal  Drinking  Water \uf8e7  Most  natural  raw\nwaters  must  be  treated  in  order  to  produce  drinking\nwater that meets federal and state requirements.  There\nare   upper   limits   for   inorganic   contaminants   (e.g.,\nasbestos, arsenic, copper, and lead), pesticides, volatile\norganic   chemicals   (e.g.,   benzene,   trichloroethylene,\ntoluene,     and     xylene),     turbidity,     microbiological\ncontaminants,   and   radiological   contaminants   (e.g.,\nradon   226,   radon   228,   tritium,   and   strontium   90).\nMunicipal     Water     Treatment     may     utilize     only\nchlorination,  or  filtration  and  chlorination  for  certain\nground water sources. For many surface water sources,\ncoagulation   (injection   of   aluminum   or   iron   salts),\nflocculation    (injection    of    a    long-chain    polymer),\nsedimentation,    lime    or    lime/soda    ash    softening,\nfiltration,  chlorination  or  chloramination  (chlorine  plus\nammonia) and other steps may be required.\n7  Major Treatment Processe s\n7. 1   Pretreatment  includes  all  of  th e  water  treatment\nsteps    ahead    of    the    Reverse    Osmosis Membrane\nTreatment  step.    These  steps  are  primarily  required  to\nprotect the membrane units from scaling with sparingly\nsoluble    salts,    fouling    with    living    or    non-living\nsuspended    particles,    or    chemical    attack    by    pH,\noxidizing   agents   or   other   dissolved   contaminants.\nPretreatment  equipment  may  include  media  filtration,\nmicro filtration, or ultrafiltration (bulk suspended solids\nremoval), 1\u20135 micron cartridge filtration (polishing step\nfor   suspended   solids   removal),   sodium-cycle   cation\nexchange  (softening,  to  remove  scale-forming  cations),\nacid injection (to minimize cellulose acetate membrane\ndamage   and/or   to   control   carbonate   scales),   scale\ninhibitor injection (to control scaling), activated carbon\nfiltration   (to   remove   oxidizing   agents   and   certain\norganic molecules), and sulfite ion injection (to remove\noxidizing agents).\n7. 2   Reverse  osmosis  Membrane  T reatment  provides\nextremely  high  rejection  of  dissolved  ions  (charged\natoms   and   molecules),   organic   (carbon   containing)\ncompounds,  silica  (silicon  containing)  compounds,  and\nvirtually complete rejection of suspended contaminants,\nbut  will  not  reject  dissolved  gases  and  volatile  organic\ncompounds  as  well.    Reverse  osmosis  (RO)  units  may"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F61-0301 \xa9 SEMI 20014\nbe  configured  in  a  double-pass  arrangement  consisting\nof  two  RO  membrane  units  in  series.      Permeate\n(filtered  water)  from  the  first  RO  unit  is  sent  to  the\nsecond   RO   unit   to   be   filtered   again.      It   is   not\nuncommon  for  the  permeate  from  a  double-pass  RO\nunit to have a resistivity reading up to 0.5\u20134 Megohm-\ncm,  with  less  than  one  milligram  per  liter  of  organic\nand   silica   contaminants.      The   more   contaminants\nremoved in the membrane treatment step, the lower the\nloading on the Polishing steps.\n7. 3   Volatiles  Removal \uf8e7  The  rem oval  of  dissolved\noxygen,   carbon   dioxide,   other   gases,   and   volatile\norganic  compounds  is  a  necessary  treatment  step.    The\nremoval of these volatile contaminants is accomplished\nto   acceptable   levels   in   vacuum   degasifiers   and   in\nmembrane    degasification    units.    The    removal    of\nvolatiles that can form ions and the removal of volatile\norganic  compounds  reduce  the  loading  on  downstream\nPolishing equipment.\n7. 4     Polishing \uf8e7    The    relatively    low     level    of\ncontaminants  that  were  not  removed  in  the  Membrane\nTreatment  and  Volatiles  Removal  steps  are  polished\ndown to acceptable levels in the Polishing steps.  Ionic,\norganic,   and   silica   contaminants   are   removed   in\ntypically two stages of Ion Exchange in series (primary\nbeds   and   polishing   beds).      Organic   compounds,\nmeasured  as  TOC  (Total  Organic  Carbon,  or  Total\nOxidizable  Carbon),  that  are  found  downstream  of  the\nRO   membrane   units   may   be   subjected   to   TOC\nReduction  ultraviolet  (UV)  irradiation  (185  nanometer\nlow pressure units or medium pressure units) to convert\nmost   of   them   into   ionic   compounds   that   can   be\neffectively  removed  by  Primary  Ion  Exchange  Units\n(usually  consisting  of  Separate  Beds,  Mixed  Beds  or\nEDI/CDI/E-Cell).    TOC    compounds    that    exit    the\nprimary  ion  exchange  units  are  typically  subjected  to\nTOC   reducing   UV   irradiation   to   break   them   into\nionized compounds to be removed by the Polishing Ion\nExchange   Units.      The   vast   majority   of   all   living\nsuspended particles (mainly bacteria) that enter any 254\nnm UV unit are inactivated.  Downstream filters with a\npore  size  of  less  than  or  equal  to  0.45  micron  remove\nthe inactivated bacterial bodies.  The final filter prior to\nDistribution  typically  has  a  pore  size  of  less  than  0.2\nmicron.\n8  Distribution\n8. 1   Distribution  is  frequently  comp osed  of  one  or\nmore Loops.      Each   loop   consists   of   UPW   that\ncontinuously  recirculates  through  appropriate  piping\nfrom   the   final   filters,   to   the   manufacturing   areas\nrequiring  UPW  (end  users),  and  back  to  a  tank  located\nwithin the Polishing  section  to  be  polished  again.    The\nUPW  to  the  end-user  area  is  commonly  called  the\nSupply.    The  UPW  that  travels  from  the  end-user  area\nback to the water treatment area is commonly called the\nReturn.    Ozone  may  be  injected  into  the  Supply  and/or\nReturn line to control microbiological contaminants and\nalso   to   enhance   the   action   of   TOC   breakdown   in\ndownstream TOC reducing UV units. Sometimes ozone\nis  injected  into  the  Supply  line  for  similar  reasons\n(requires     de-ozonation     at     the     end-use     points).\nSometimes  the  UPW  in  the  distribution  loop  is  heated\n(hot loop) for particular processes.\n8. 2  Basic System Components\n8. 3  General \uf8e7  Each  UPW  system   contains  certain\nbasic  components  and  a  variety  of  design  options  to\nmeet   particular   customer   and   facility   needs.
