The input particle concentration is measured byCNC-B, while the output particle concentration ismeasured by CNC-A. The pressure and flow rates inboth legs should be carefully balanced (by maintainingan identical differential pressure in both legs) to insurethat the challenge level is the same.7.2.2 Set the first and subsequent challenge particlesizes per Section 6.6.7.2.3 Particle challenge concentrations should be set tothe maximum output of the electrostatic classifier foreach of the particle size tests (Section 6.6). This willdetermine the test volume and the duration of the test.Generally this requires generating a polydispersedaerosol having a mean size close to the desiredmonodispersed aerosol size. Any difference betweenthe flow rate exiting the electrostatic classifier and thetest flow rate specified in Section 6.5 will be made upby dilution gas as shown in Figure 1.7.2.4 The total particle challenge must be limited to1  10 9 particles per liter of filter rated flow in slm.This is done to limit the effects of a particle cake build-up which would enhance the efficiency of the test filter.The test should be concluded upon exposure to 1  10 9particles per liter of rated flow or after 10 downstreamcounts are observed, whichever occurs first.7.2.4.1 As an example, a 10 liter per minute filterwould be challenged in one minute with (10 slm)  (1minute)  (1  10 9 particles/liter) or 1  1010 particles.If the challenge concentration is 1  10 8 particles perliter and the flow rate is 10 slm, then the test wouldneed to last 10 minutes or when 10 downstreamparticles were observed.7.2.4.2 The sample interval shall be 1 minute induration. The sample interval in the penetration test isequivalent to the sample interval in the systembackground test (Section 7.1.2).7.2.5 Measure the input and output particleconcentration.7.2.6 Calculate the ratio of output to input particleconcentration. 8 Reporting of Test Results8.1 Raw data shall be reported for each test in theformat of a table, including the number of sampleintervals, the sampling volume of each interval, thesampling time of each interval, and the total number ofparticles registered in each interval. In addition, therelevant parameters for each test described in Sections8.2 and 8.3 should be identified. 8.2 Static Background Test  Identify the period oftime required to obtain 45 consecutive samplingintervals without a particle being detected for the spoolpiece and test filter.8.3 Penetration Test  Identify the inputconcentration, the output concentration, the ratio ofoutput to input concentration (fractional penetration),and the challenge particle size. The most penetratingparticle size is the challenge particle at the largestfractional penetration. Care must be taken to distinguishbetween true penetration and system background counts(see Section 8.5) as measured in Section 7.1.2.8.4 Efficiency Class8.4.1 If no penetration is observed then report the POUGas Filter passed a X LRV efficiency test, where X =the maximum detectable efficiency for the test (asdefined in Section 2.2). No penetration is defined aswhen the filter output is not statistically different fromthe system background (as defined in Section 8.5).8.4.2 If penetration is observed , then report that thePOU Gas Filter failed a X LRV efficiency test, where Xis the maximum detectable efficiency for the test (asdefined in Section 2.2). Penetration is defined as whenthe filter output is statistically different from the systembackground (as defined in Section 8.5).8.4.2.1 The LRV defines the number of nines in theefficiency.8.4.2.2 Example: A filter with a fractional penetrationof 0.00001 has a LRV of 5 and an efficiency of99.999%8.5 Data Reduction8.5.1 The statistical analysis is based on theassumption that the particles generated are randomlydistributed and are statistically independent of eachother. The background counts are independent of theparticle performance of the component. The particlecounts observed from the test include the counts fromthe component and the background count.Let: XB = average background particle count Xt = average total particle count from test Xc = average particle count generated by the testcomponentTherefore, Xt = X c + X B 8.5.2 A statistical analysis of the data is performed to"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 2 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F38-1104 \xa9 SEMI 1999, 2004 4 determine the mean, standard deviation, and thestandard error for each particle size range.8.5.3 The sample mean, X, or average of the data foreach state is given by: X = Xini = 1n where Xiis the observed counts for the state and n is the numberof samples.8.5.4 The sample standard deviation is a measure ofthe variability of the data about the mean.

The average particle count generated by the testcomponent, Xc, is given by: Xc = Xt  X B 8.5.8 The standard error in a distribution of differencesbetween means is expressed as:Sec = Set2+ S eB2 8.5.9 The 95% confidence interval of the testcomponent itself is then determined by:X c \xb1 2 S ec 8.5.10 If this confidence interval includes 0, then thisimplies that there is not strong statistical evidence ofthe component having an effect on the observed particlecount.

Available industry standard test methodsare listed in Table 3 and the Related Documentssection. 7 Apparatus and Materials7.1 Containers, as defined in Tabl e 1.7.1.1 All containers and caps used in component andblank extraction should be thoroughly cleaned. Atypical recommended cleaning procedure is outlined inSection 11.3. However, any cleaning procedure isacceptable as long as the subsequent blank extractionyields impurity concentrations that do not exceed 10%of the specification for the material being tested. Forexample, if a given impurity is specified for amaximum of 1.0 g/cm2, the blank extractionconcentration should not exceed 0.1 g/cm2.NOTE: In situations where the detection limit is greaterthan 10% of the specification for the polymer material,the detection limit of the instrument converted intog/cm2 will suffice, provided it does not exceed thespecification for the material being tested. 7.2 Test Fluids7.2.1 For purposes of this practice , references to watershall be understood to mean ultrapure water as definedby maximum individual metal and anion impurity levelsof 0.1 parts per billion by weight 1  10 -9 (ppbw) orless, total organic carbon (TOC) levels of 10 ppbw orless, nonvolatile residue levels of 0.1 parts per millionby weight 1  10 -6 (ppmw) or less, resistivity of 18megohm-cm or greater, and reactive silica impurity ofless than 1.0 ppb.7.2.2 References to HF, NH4OH and H 2 O 2 shall beunderstood to refer to chemicals with a minimum of asemiconductor grade purity and meet the criteria insection 7.1.1.

This practice does notpurport to address the safety considerations associatedwith its use. It is the responsibility of the user toestablish appropriate safety and health practices and todetermine the applicability of regulatory limitationsbefore using this practice.8.2 Technical Precautions8.2.1 The component preparations m ust be conductedin clean environments that prevent contamination of thecomponents and containers at the parts per trillion levelfor the analyte(s) of interest. A clean environment mayrequire the use of a cleanroom (for those procedureswhich can be performed in a cleanroom).8.2.2 For all testing other than differ ential scanningcalorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis(TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR), the component preparation should take place ina controlled environment to minimize contamination. 9 Sampling and Test Specim ens9.1 The components selected for t esting should reflectthe current manufacturing capabilities of the supplier. 10 Procedure for Preparing C omponents andCollecting an Extraction Sample for Analysis10.1 Component preparation for co ntaminants that canbe leached from liquid chemical distributioncomponents is different from component preparationfor bulk polymer analysis.

Orbitalshakers or manual agitation can be used, but no foreignmaterials may contact the test fluid; therefore, stir barscannot be used. Components and/or containers are toremain sealed during agitation to prevent splashing orspilling. Components in containers (such as gaskets)should remain completely submerged throughout theextraction.10.5 Components that Require Cap ping (Tubing,Piping, Valves, Regulators, and Filter Housings)10.5.1 This practice is appropriate for static sampleswith one end permanently sealed and one end looselycapped. Since the sealing process may contaminate thesample, one end should be sealed prior to precleaning.Use cleaned caps meeting the criteria specified inSection 7.6.1. The cap must be manufactured from thesame material as the component or from a compatiblematerial that will not contaminate the sample.10.5.2 As surfactants and solvents ma y leave a residuethat could alter the test results, do not use them forprecleaning.10.5.3 During sample collection for metal analysis, thecomponents must be acid stabilized to a pH of 2(approximately 3 drops of concentrated nitric acid per250 mL of UPW) to stabilize for certain trace metals(i.e., iron and chromium).10.5.4 Tubing and piping: Fill the component with test fluid to within one inch of the top of the component toallow free space for agitation. In the case of tubing orpipes, to maximize the exposed surface area of the pipeto the volume of fluid and to minimize the surface areaof the end cap, it is recommended that the ratio of thesurface area of the pipe to the surface area of the endcap be 10 or greater. The equation to determine theratio is 4L/D, where L is the length of the pipe or tubingand D is the diameter.10.5.5 Valves, regulators, and fittings: To allow formaximum fluid volume, fill valves, regulators, andfittings with the appropriate test fluid to within five mLof the top to allow for agitation. Multiple componentsmay be required to obtain the necessary volume for thetest. Valves, regulators, and fittings must be capped atboth ends. In the case of valves, this practice assumesthat normally opened valves will be used.10.5.6 Filter housings: Fill the compo nent with theappropriate test fluid to within one inch of the top of thehousing to allow free space for agitation. The inlet andoutlet of the housing must be capped.10.5.7 Example of procedure for components thatrequire capping10.5.7.1 Clean and prepare 8 covered co ntainers perSections 10.4.1 and 7.1.1.10.5.7.2 Flush component and blank ex tractioncontainers (3 components and 5 blank extractioncontainers) according to Section 10.4.2 (rinse 10 timesfor 2 minutes per Table 1).10.5.7.3 Fill all components and blank extractioncontainers with the test media of choice (see Section 2.3for definition of test media).10.5.7.4 Soak according to Section 10.4 .3 (soak oneweek per table 1), agitate all components and blankextraction containers once a day for one minute perSection 10.4.4.10.5.7.5 Decant the contents of the component into 3remaining empty containers.10.5.7.6 At completion of this practice analytical testsshould be performed on test fluid from each containersee test methods noted in Table 3 and relateddocuments section.10.6 Components that Require a Co ntainer (Gaskets,and O-Rings)10.6.1 Containers must have sufficien t internal volumeto perform the required test.

For certain applications orspecific chemicals, other testing may becomeincorporated in the qualification process. These othertests may include assay analysis, anion analysis, TOCanalysis, moisture analysis, etc. 3 Limitations3.1 This guide does not define the test methods thatshould be used for evaluation of samples taken duringthe qualification process, or distinguish test methodsthat will generate accurate and reliable results fromthose that will not generate accurate or reliable results.3.2 This guide does not define or d escribe thesampling methodologies that are required in order tophysically take a representative and a non-contaminatedbatch sample. However, appropriate samplingprocedures and equipment must be used consistent withthe actual specifications.3.3 This guide does not define the type of containersthat should be used for sampling. Pretreatment ofcontainers is necessary to assure that the data generated by testing actually measures the chemical beingdelivered to the process tool and not the impurities inthe container itself, from the environment, or fromhuman handling.3.4 This guide does not address th e type, level, orfrequency of testing necessary and appropriate forongoing monitoring of a BCDS.3.5 This guide does not address th e special case of asystem designed and used for the generation anddistribution of high purity water used in semiconductorprocessing.3.6 This guide does not address th e testing andprequalification of materials, subassemblies, orcomponents used in a BCDS.3.7 This guide does not address th e protocols andrequirements defined by the manufacturer concerningthe installation of the BCDS.3.8 This guide does not define the actual specificationsgenerally negotiated between the user and themanufacturer of the BCDS, against which chemicalsamples are tested and qualification is passed.3.9 This guide does not address th e qualificationprocess for chemicals through the process tool.

This step is often initiated after the UPWsystem is functional and an acceptable resistivity isachieved but before chemicals are authorized to bebrought on-site. Although UPW does not extract highlevels of metallic and ionic impurities from the BCDSmaterials of construction, this step can ensure that theBCDS and distribution piping is free of any grosscontamination that may have been introduced into thesystem during installation. In addition, the UPW flushcan be effective for the elimination of some types ofparticles.6.2 Particle Qualification  The B CDS is flushedwith UPW and the levels of particles are measuredusing an on-line optical particle counter. The stepsfollowed include:6.2.1 Install an acceptable UPW wa ter filter element(s)per the filter and BCDS manufacturer's specifications.6.2.2 Fill the BCDS with UPW and r ecirculateinternally to ensure that all piping is filled with UPW.6.2.3 Begin sampling to a liquid par ticle counterdownstream of the filters either at the outlet of theBCDS, the POU, or both. Follow an approved particlecounting sampling procedure.6.2.4 Continue recirculating and flus hing until theparticle concentrations in the desired channel orchannels are observed at levels below the agreed-uponspecification. An example of typical specification is theaverage of five consecutive ten minute readings of"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 16 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,'SEMI F41-0699 \xa9 SEMI 19993 purity chemical flushed to drain during the qualificationprocess, this approach may also prove to be more costeffective depending on the cost of the chemical used forpickling, compared to the cost of the process chemicaldesignated for use in the line.7.2 Conditioning With Same Chem ical  A variationon the above approach is to "pickle" the system with theprocess chemical that is intended to be used in theBCDS line a 24-72 hour soak period and flushing thechemical to drain. While the process chemical may notbe as aggressive in cleaning up the line, this approachhas the advantage that the extracted metals have thesame fingerprint as those that might otherwise beobserved during the final qualification testing, and thefinal qualification may be done immediately followingthis step, without further preparation.7.3 Testing the Preconditioning Ch emical  Ratherthan relying on an arbitrary or predetermined lengths oftime for preconditioning the BCDS, test samples areoften taken and analyzed to ensure that the requiredlevel of impurities has actually been obtained. Thistesting is often commissioned by the equipmentmanufacturer and not reported to the customer as part ofthe BCDS qualification. Indicator elements are oftenanalyzed that are either of particular concern in theprocess chemical, or elements such as Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe,Mg, Na, Ni, and Zn, that are known as commonimpurities in chemicals and that are also highlydetrimental in semiconductor processing.7.4 Conditioning Procedure  Th e three mostcommon chemicals (HCL, HF, and HNO3) used forprecleaning the BCDS are aggressive in extractingmetallic impurities and particles. The steps followedinclude:7.4.1 Install an acceptable chemical filter element(s)per the filter and BCDS manufacturer\'s specifications.7.4.2 Fill the BCDS and distribution piping with thechemical of choice and recirculate internally to ensurethat all piping is filled. This may include alldistribution piping. Let the chemical soak the materialsof construction in a static manner for a period of 24 to72 hours, or continue recirculating the chemical as aclosed loop for the same amount of time.7.4.3 Flush the chemical from the sy stem.7.4.4 Depending on the chemical us ed, a UPW rinsestep or an inert gas purge step for drying may berequired prior to filling the system with the actualchemical for the qualification testing.Note: The precleaning chemicals used may addundesirable contaminants (i.e. F- from Hydrofluoricacid, Cl- from hydrochloric acid, etc.). Therefore, if any of these chemicals are used, additional testing maybe required to determine that these materials have notadded contaminants in excess of any specification.These contaminants may be tested in the UPW rinsestep or in the final chemical qualification step. 7.5 Solvent Systems  The type o f chemical used forflushing solvent BCDS systems is different than thatused for oxidizers and corrosive chemicals since solventsystems can be made from stainless steel and metalmaterials for reasons of safety and chemicalcompatibility. Generally, IPA, or the chemical to beused in the system, is used for the aqueous pre-cleanstep in flushing a system where solvents are to be used. 8 Final Chemical Qualificati on8.1 Initial Considerations  Notw ithstanding any ofthe steps taken to prepare the BCDS for qualificationtesting, certain issues should be considered prior tostarting any sampling required in the qualificationprocess:8.1.1 Determination about the adequa cy of thesampling points.  The sampling points are generallycoincident with the location of pre-existing sampleports on the Valve Manifold Box, day tank and otherdistribution points. The adequacy of the samplingpoints depends on their accessibility, environmentalcontrols, ability to flush prior to sampling, and safetyconsiderations.8.1.2 Adequacy of data.  Due to s ampling error,possibility of environmental contamination, handlingproblems, and impurities in sampling containers,samples should be taken in duplicate or triplicate, withtwo samples sent to the lab for testing and one sampleretained in case of a dispute.8.1.3 Use of proper precleaned samp ling containers. Sampling containers must be chemically compatibleand precleaned in a manner consistent with the desiredspecification level for impurities. Sample bottlepreparation differs depending on the type of testing tobe performed.8.1.4 Use of a contamination-free sa mpling device forsamples pulled from an open vessel or a drum.8.1.5 Proper training for personnel a ssigned tosampling.  The proper training is required to ensurethat personnel charged with sampling followappropriate safety and contamination-free protocols.'),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 17 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,'SEMI F41-0699 \xa9 SEMI 1999 4 8.2 Particle Qualification  For m ost accurate results,particle levels should be measured on-line with aoptical particle counter capable of measuring the size ofparticle that is included in the guaranteed specification.Batch samples may be taken and measured for particlesin a lab, but special care is needed to prequalifycontainers used for this sampling, and data integritymay be compromised for the smallest sized particlesdue to various contamination sources. An example of aprotocol generally followed to measure particle on-lineincludes:8.2.1 Remove all UPW in the BCDS and distributionpiping.8.2.2 Remove UPW filters or replac e incompatiblechemical filters if present.8.2.3 Install specified filter element per the BCDS andfilter manufacture\'s specifications.8.2.4 Commission the BCDS and di stribution pipingwith the process chemical.8.2.5 Recirculate chemical through t he BCDS andthrough all POU to drain.8.2.6 Drain all chemicals from the B CDS anddistribution piping.8.2.7 Refill entire system with chem ical and begincirculation through filters and out to POU to drain.8.2.8 Begin sampling to a liquid par ticle counterdownstream of the filters either at the outlet of theBCDS, the POU, or both. Follow a prescribed particlecounting sampling procedure.8.2.9 The number of particle sample s and sampleduration time should be calculated based on the totalvolume of chemical desired to be examined by theparticle counter. A "sufficient" volume of chemicalshould be examined by the particle counter during thequalification period. As an example, the particleconcentration could be measured over at least a five-hour period with thirty consecutive ten-minute samplestaken. In this example, the average of the lastconsecutive 30 samples would be calculated andcompared to the specification.8.2.10 The particle concentration is c onsideredacceptable if the average is less than the specification.8.3 Metallic Qualification  Meta llic impurities aregenerally specified both in terms of level of impurity byelement and total amount of impurities. The customer\'sspecification generally lists each element to be includedin the analysis or may refer to the list of elementspublished by SEMI for each chemical at different puritygrades. The maximum impurity levels may bedescribed as an absolute value (e.g. 1ppb maximum impurity), or in terms of the quantity of impurities thatmay be added by the BCDS including the distributionpiping. This amount of "total adders" is determined bymeasuring the impurity levels of the incoming chemicalfrom the storage or supply vessel compared to thepurity level of the chemical at the end point samplestation or POU. The number of samples and location ofsamples vary depending on the type of specification.When qualifying to a metallic impurities addedspecification, a sample must be taken from theincoming chemical supply drums for an incomingbaseline. The testing protocols includes:8.3.1 Precondition all sampling bott les before use andfollow appropriate sampling protocol.8.3.2 Send samples to a lab for trace metal analysisspecifying the level of testing required and the numberof elements to be tested. The level of testing requireddepends on the agreed upon specification. As a rule ofthumb, the detection limits of the analysis should be atleast 10X\'s lower than the impurity level to be achievedfor each element. In addition, the lab should followhigh standards of quality control for trace metalanalysis including analysis in duplicate, duplicateblanks, use of internal standards, instrument calibrationusing primary standards, and QC checks.8.3.3 Review the data that is reporte d and compare itto the customer requirement.8.3.4 If the system does not meet the specificationthen repeat the procedure until the system is qualified.8.3.5 Where maximum levels of imp urities arespecified, a sample of the incoming chemical shouldeither be measured as part of the qualification process,or retained, to ensure that the incoming chemical is nota significant source of contamination.8.3.6 For purposes of metallic qualif ication, soakperiods similar to those referenced in Section 7.2 arerecommended. 9 Other Considerations9.1 Accelerated Qualification Tec hniques Although process chemicals such as hydrofluoric andhydrochloric acid may reach acceptable levels of purityafter a few weeks in the BCDS, other chemicals such assulfuric acid and ammonium hydroxide extractimpurities much more slowly and significant levels ofimpurities are observed even after several months. TheBCDS conditioning process described above is oneapproach to preleaching impurities from the BCDS.Other variations include combinations of static anddynamic rinses and emphasis on the use of dilute HF asthe aqueous preclean chemical that is particularlyeffective for iron removal, however, it contributes high'),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 18 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F41-0699 \xa9 SEMI 19995 levels of fluoride which may be a concern for somequalification processes.9.2 Specialty Chemicals  Certai n CVD chemicalshave high levels of organics which raise concerns aboutchemical decomposition, residues and particulateformation. These concerns may require customizedapproaches to the design of a BCDS qualification. Forexample, reservoir replacement for these types ofchemicals with vapor pressure from 1-5 Torr and abovemay require the use of vacuum less than the vaporpressure of the chemical whereas low vapor pressurechemicals with vapor pressures from 1-5 Torr, andviscous materials, may require a solvent purge. Inaddition, purging and pickling of he BCDS andchemical delivery lines should be performed perSections 7.1 and 7.2.

The DAS must measure thevoltage and current at least two cycles (40/33 ms)before, during, and at least two cycles (40/33 ms) afterthe voltage sag event. The DAS must have theperformance characteristics defined in Table 1.NOTE 3: (40/33 ms) refers to 40 ms at 50 Hz or 33 ms at 60Hz.

International,national and local codes, regulations and laws should beconsulted to ensure that the equipment and procedures meetregulatory requirements in each testing location. 7.1 Work should be conducted in a ccordance withindustry standard safety procedures. Since panels mayneed to be open in order to connect voltage probes androute power leads to and from the sag generator, thiswork is classified as Type 2 Energized Electrical Workper SEMI S2. Test equipment manufacturers safetyrecommendations should be followed.7.2 Worker Safety7.2.1 During testing lock and tag (lo ckout/tagout)procedures should be followed to control hazardousenergy (reference appropriate regional regulations andrequirements). No circuit should be connected or wiredwhen electricity is present. This includes powerconnections as well as the connection of variousmonitoring probes.7.2.2 The area immediately surround ing the deviceunder test (DUT) should be cordoned off and appro-priate signs like Test In Progress should be posted.7.2.3 Appropriate personal protectiv e equipmentshould be worn at all times.7.2.4 Only authorized personnel sho uld be allowedwithin the cordoned off test area.7.2.5 Work should be done as descri bed in the testprocedure (see Section 10)."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 21 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F42-0600 \xa9 SEMI 1999, 20003 7.2.6 Proper connections should be traced and verifiedbefore energizing.7.3 Equipment Safety7.3.1 The sag generator should have a fail-safe design.NOTE 5: Subjecting equipment to repeated voltage sags ofless than 80% nominal for longer than 3 seconds may damageequipment. 7.3.2 The sag generator should be pr otected by anappropriately sized branch circuit breaker at the utilitypower source. This will protect the sag generator andDUT from short circuits and overcurrent conditions.7.3.3 Every effort should be made to protect the DUT.As with other equipment tests damage to the DUT ispossible. Although only a remote possibility, theequipment owner should be made aware of the potentialfor damage. 8 Sampling and Test Specim ens8.1 Characterization tests are cond ucted on samples ofproduction articles, not on each item produced.Characterization tests apply to equipment that ismanufactured to a single design either in multiplequantities or one-of-a-kind. The equipment selected fortesting should reflect current production models of thesupplier.8.2 The intent of this document is to make reasonableefforts to test the semiconductor process, metrology,and automated test equipment as a complete operating system under the actual intended conditions of end use.To simulate the worst-case condition, the testsdescribed in this document should be performed duringthe most sensitive process mode of the equipment asdetermined by the equipment supplier. 9 Test Setup9.1 The test setup should consist o f a sag generatorand a data acquisition system as shown in Figure 1.9.2 When the current required by t he DUT is withinthe sag generators rating, the sag generator shall beconnected between the incoming utility power sourceand the point of connection (POC) on the DUT. If thecurrent required by the DUT is greater than the rating ofthe sag generator, then individual subsystems of theDUT can be tested separately.9.2.1 If DUT subsystem testing is re quired due to thelimitation of the sag generator, each subsystem must betested independently with the other parts of the DUToperating. Tested in this manner, any interlocks oralarms that might activate during the test will beapparent. Testing the DUT main power module mayrequire providing power to only the main powermodule, leaving the subsystems turned off. After thecharacteristics of the DUT main power module EMOcircuit are known, testing of DUT subsystems can beginas described.9.2.2 Power down the DUT.

The IGBT based switch is the mostcontrollable with the ability to precisely control thepoint on the waveform in which the voltage sag startsand finishes (0-360 degrees). With an SCR switch, thepoint on wave of the voltage sag starts can becontrolled, but the cutoff point of the voltage sag willbe fixed at zero degrees. In real power systems, thepoint-on-wave in which the voltage sag occurs issomewhat random and unpredictable. A contactorbased unit simulates the randomness of a real powersystem in that the point-on-wave in which the voltagesag begins is not controllable, but is dependent on thelag time between energizing the coil of the contactorand contactor closure. Figure R1-1 below displays a three-phase sag generator test fixture with dataacquisition.R1-2.2 As shown in Figure R1-1, voltage sags areinjected into the load referenced to the neutral.

This test method does notpurport to address the safety considerations associatedwith its use. It is the responsibility of the user toestablish appropriate safety and health practices anddetermine the applicability of regulatory limitationsbefore using this method.6.2 Exhaust from the CNC may co ntain hazardousand/or flammable vapors and should be properlyvented.6.2.1 Only inert gases like nitrogen and argon shouldbe used for purifier testing. No air is allowed in thepurifier testing procedure described in thisdocument.6.3 Care should be taken to minim ize the purifiersexposure to room air during and after testing. 7 Test Protocol7.1 Test Conditions7.1.1 The test is to be conducted at a normal indoortemperature of between 18\xb0C (64\xb0F) and 26\xb0C (78\xb0F).Environmental temperature within this range is notexpected to have any measurable effect on particledetection. Follow manufacturers recommendedhandling procedures.7.1.2 Test apparatus must be enclose d in a Class 100environment (per current revision of Federal Standard209). If a clean hood is used, the hood should belocated within a clean environment. Use proceduresnecessary to maintain Class 100 when handling testapparatus and test component.7.1.3 Care should be taken to protec t the test apparatusfrom excessive vibration. For example, vacuum pumpsand compressors should be isolated from the system.7.2 Apparatus7.2.1 Materials7.2.1.1 Test gas  Nitrogen of minim um dryness of","<","10 PPM moisture at 790.57 kPa (100psig) with ","<",'10ppm of total hydrocarbons.7.2.1.2 Filters  Electronics grade fil ters are requiredto provide "particle-free" test gas.

Thesampler collects gas from the stream exiting the testdevice, where the sample is near-isokinetic in design.7.2.1.8 Upstream adapter  The upst ream adapterpiece connects 12.7 mm (1/2in.) tubing to the testdevice. For 12.7 mm (1/2in.) test devices, the adapteris a simple face-seal connector. For 6.35 mm (1/4in.)test devices, the adapter is a tapered cone between 6.35mm and 12.7 mm (1/4 and 1/2in.) face-sealconnections.7.2.1.9 Downstream adapter  The d ownstreamadapter piece connects 12.7 mm (1/2in.) tubing of thesampler to the test device.

The spool piece is to be installedin the system in place of the DUT while obtainingbackground counts for the system.7.2.1.11 Fittings  Face seal connecto rs orcompression fittings dependent on test component endconnections. The end connection fittings of each DUTbeing compared must be of the same type.7.2.1.12 Gaskets  Use metal gaskets for attachingthe test device and adapter pieces. New gaskets shouldbe used for each new connection. The use of metalgaskets is recommended in order to minimize theparticles that may be generated by installation of thetest piece. The use of silver plated metal gaskets shouldbe avoided because they shed particles after installation.7.2.1.13 Mechanical shock device  T o providemechanical shock by impact to the test device (seeFigure 2).7.2.1.14 Actuator  A gas (compresse d air ornitrogen) operated device connected to the valve stemto open and close the valve. 7.2.1.15 Actuator pressure  Minimum actuator gasline pressure required to fully open and close the valveduring the dynamic test.7.2.2 Instrumentation7.2.2.1 A CNC whose counting efficie ncycharacteristics fall within the envelope defined in FEDSTD 209 for counting ultrafine particles is to be usedfor particle counting. Test durations in this test methodhave been established based on a sampling flow rate of0.05 scfm.7.2.2.2 Instruments should be calibrat ed regularly,according to manufacturer's recommendations. For theCNC, this includes routine checks of instrumentoperation as specified by the manufacturer.7.2.2.3 The CNC and data collection e quipment musthave power surge suppression.7.2.3 Setup and Schematic7.2.3.1 Assemble the test apparatus ac cording to theschematic drawing of the test apparatus used shown inFigure 1. Install the test apparatus inside a class 100clean room. Adjust the inlet gas pressure to therequired pressure of 30 psig using the pressure regulatorR1 as indicated by an electronics grade pressure gaugeP1. The filtered gas flow is then diverted to flowthrough either of the two flowmeters locateddownstream of the valve V1.7.2.3.1.1 The test gas delivered from the flow metersis filtered again by an electronics grade filter F2. Thetest gas pressure at this point is measured by anotherelectronics grade pressure gauge P2 installed upstreamof filter F2. A pneumatic valve PV1 is installeddownstream of the filter F2 for obtaining the particlecounts for the dynamic test portion (including thebackground) of the test method. The test gas is filteredonce again by another electronics grade filter F3 beforeit is delivered to the spool piece and the test component.7.2.3.1.2 Particles released from the spo ol piece andthe test component are measured by a CNC locateddownstream of these components. A representativesample of the gas flow is sampled by the CNC throughan isokinetic sampler located downstream of the testdevices. The CNC measures particle concentrationevery minute, sampling at a flow rate of 0.05 scfm, toprovide a continuous measurement of particle countsfor the static, dynamic, and impact tests on the testpieces. The particle data can also be collected andstored in a computer using a data acquisition program.7.2.3.1.3 A schematic drawing of a reco mmended testapparatus is given in Figure 1.

A continuous low flow (0.1 scfm) isto be maintained to purge the system. The particlecounter may be turned off. For an extended shutdown,the system (excluding the CNC) should be pressurizedand capped.7.2.3.3 After initial construction, the s pool pieceshould be installed and the test apparatus (except theCNC) should be pressurized and tested for leaks in thesystem. It is recommended that a helium leak detectoror a pressure decay method be used to detect leaks inthe system. The system should then be cleaned byrunning a high flow rate of test gas with simultaneousgentle tapping of all components (except the CNC)downstream of the final filter F3. This procedureshould be followed by a start-up phase whichcharacterizes system cleanliness by conducting theentire test protocol with the control product installed.This start-up phase should continue and be repeated asnecessary until the counts from the control product havestabilized at or below the expected number of countsfrom the test components.7.3 Test ProceduresNOTE: Ensure the counter is counting continuouslyand reporting data every minute. For the duration ofthe test, the counter should be continuously counting,except where noted in the test protocol.7.3.1 Background Test7.3.1.1 Ensure that the spool piece and proper adaptersare in place on the test apparatus.7.3.1.2 Static Test  Close the pneum atic valve(PV1). Set regulator R1 to 30 psig. Open thepneumatic valve (PV1) to establish flow. Using theflow control device, set the test flow to manufacturersrecommended maximum flow. Measure the staticbackground count. Background count is establishedwhen the counter has sampled a minimum of 3 scf, andthe arithmetic average during the last 3 scf of gassampled is ","<","2 particles/scf. At a sample flow rate of0.05 scfm, the time required is one hour. Ensure thatthe background counts are stable or decreasing. Ifbackground cannot be achieved after 6 scf have beensampled, there may be a problem with the counter ortest apparatus. 7.3.1.3 Dynamic Test  Set the actua tor pressure ofPV1 to its minimum pressure recommended by themanufacturer to fully open the valve. Actuate thepneumatic valve PV1 at 30 cycles per minute tomeasure the background counts under dynamic testconditions. Dynamic background count is establishedwhen the counter has sampled a minimum of 3 scf, andthe arithmetic average during the last 3 scf of gassampled is ","<"," 3 particles/scf. (Estimated dynamicbackground count will be verified and altered ifnecessary during the validation phase of this testmethod.) At a sample flow rate of 0.05 scfm, the timerequired is 1 hour. If dynamic background cannot beachieved after 6 scf have been sampled, there may be aproblem with the counter or test apparatus.7.3.1.4 Stop the pneumatic valve cycl ing. Flush thesystem for 10 minutes under static test conditions.7.3.1.5 Purifier Impact Test  Impac t the spool pieceonce per minute for ten minutes with the mechanicalshock device (See Figure 2). The impact backgroundcount should be ","<","4 particles/scf over the ten minutes ofthe test. (Estimated impact background count will beverified and altered if necessary during the validationphase of this test method.) If impact backgroundcannot be achieved, repeat the shock a second time. Ifthe impact background count specification still cannotbe met, there may be a problem with the counter or testapparatus.7.3.1.6 Flush the system for 30 minute s at the test flowrate. Record the resulting count.7.3.1.7 Turn the CNC pump off while leaving theCNC power on.7.3.2 Purifier Static Test7.3.2.1 Using the flow control device, decrease theflow rate to 0.10.2 scfm, so that some flow remains inthe system while the test purifier is installed.7.3.2.2 Remove the spool piece by firs t disconnectingthe downstream fitting and then the upstream fitting.Immediately install the test component in a fully openposition by first connecting the upstream fitting andthen the downstream fitting. Removal of the spoolpiece and installation of the test component to minimizereactions of the purifier with room air and extraneouscontamination and prevent the counter from cooling offshould take no longer than 3 minutes. Extreme careshould be taken to minimize contamination of the testapparatus during this operation. The test component isto be removed from its inner bag in the Class 100 testarea. If the test component has mechanical fittings,these fittings are to be properly connected. If the testcomponent has tube ends, the component is to beinstalled with clean compression fittings.

Originally published September 1999. 1 Purpose1.1 Semiconductor factories requi re high levels ofpower quality due to the sensitivity of equipment andprocess controls. Semiconductor processing equipmentis especially vulnerable to voltage sags. This documentdefines the voltage sag ride-through capability requiredfor semiconductor processing, metrology, andautomated test equipment.1.2 The requirements in this intern ational standardwere developed to satisfy semiconductor industryneeds. While more stringent than existing genericstandards, this industry-specific specification is not inconflict with known generic equipment regulationsfrom other regions or generic equipment standards fromother organizations (see Related Information section).1.3 It is the intent of this standard to providespecifications for semiconductor processing equipmentthat will lead to improved selection criteria for sub-components and improvements in equipment systemsdesign. While it is recognized that in certain extremecases or for specific functions battery storage devicesmay be appropriate, it is not the intent of this standardto increase the size or use of battery storage devicesprovided with equipment. Focus on improvements inequipment component and system design should lead toa reduction or elimination in the use of battery storagedevices to achieve equipment reliability during voltagesag events. 2 Scope2.1 This document specifies the m inimum voltage sagride-through capability design requirements forequipment used in the semiconductor industry. Theexpected equipment performance capability is showngraphically on a chart representing voltage sag durationand percent deviation of equipment nominal voltage.Standard evaluation test method references are alsoincluded.2.2 The primary focus for this spe cification issemiconductor processing equipment including but notlimited to the following tool types: Etch equipment (Dry & Wet), Film deposition equipment (CVD & PVD),  Thermal equipment, Surface prep and clean, Photolithography equipment (Stepper & Tracks), Chemical Mechanical Polishing equipment, Ion Implant equipment, Metrology equipment, and Automated test equipment.2.3 This specification applies to se miconductorprocessing equipment to include the equipmentmainframe and all subsystems whose electrical power isdirectly affected by the operation of the equipmentsEMO system.2.4 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Not included in this standard a re over voltageconditions, voltage sag duration of less than 0.05seconds (50 milliseconds), and voltage sag duration ofgreater than 1.0 seconds. If necessary, the InformationTechnology Industry Council (ITIC) CBEMA-curvecontained in IEEE 446, IEEE 1100, and SEMI E51 canbe used to specify additional requirements outside therange of this document (see Related Information,Section R1-1).3.2 This specification does not add ress wafer qualitywith regard to processing variation caused by voltagesags. It is recommended that each equipment supplierconsider the effects of voltage sags on their equipmentprocesses. If voltage sags above the defined line canresult in known wafer quality problems, then an appro-priate notification-only scheme should be considered inthe equipment design. To be in conformance with thisstandard that notification scheme should not beclassified as an equipment interrupt per SEMI E10.3.3 This standard addresses specif ications forsemiconductor processing equipment voltage sagimmunity.
