Initially available at ",(0,r.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.semi.orgSeptember"},"www.semi.orgSeptember")," 2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published September 1999; previouslypublished November 2001. NOTICE: This document was completely rewritten in2004. 1 Purpose1.1 Silicon wafers are often subjected to reclaimprocesses in order to improve manufacturing efficiencyin device production. A reclaimed wafer is one that hasbeen re-conditioned for subsequent utilization.1.2 This specification covers requirements forreclaimed silicon wafers to be used for testing andprocess monitoring in semiconductor manufacturing.1.3 In some instances for 300 mm wafers with suppliermarked back surfaces, it is necessary to re-inscribe themark after one or more reclaim cycles. Consequently,this specification also includes an appendix that coversthe re-inscription of such wafers.NOTE 1: Issues related to the re-inscription of such 300 mmwafers are discussed in Related Information 1. 2 Scope2.1 This specification divides reclaimed wafers intofour application categories: Mechanical, Furnace,Particle, and Lithography and provides tables of thespecification requirements for each category. Thus, aprospective purchaser of reclaimed silicon wafers needsto know which application matches his or herrequirements.2.2 Only requirements for some attributes are specifiedin Tables 1 and 2. Other requirements are indicated tobe customer specified which means that the customermay specify a requirement for that particular attribute,as-supplied which means that the attribute haswhatever value was supplied in the wafer delivered (orused) for reclaim, and unspecified which means thatthe attribute is not specified and for which the waferdoes not need to be tested.2.3 In addition to the general categories listed inSection 2.1, this specification provides requirements forreclaimed wafers intended for use in advanced deviceproduction, including devices in the 180 and 130 nmtechnology generations in a third table.2.4 This specification is directed specifically to siliconwafers with one or both polished surfaces. If the wafers have epitaxial deposits, the attributes of the epitaxiallayer are not included the specification requirements.2.5 This specification covers reclaim wafers that areeither customer-supplied or third party-sourced. Theuser should exercise caution when sourcing materialswith unknown thermal histories, unknown bulkcontamination, or unknown deposits, such as gold (Au)films.2.6 For applications placing higher demands on siliconwafers such as particle counting, measuring patternresolution in a photolithography process, or surface ioncontamination monitoring, the customer may want toreference SEMI M1, SEMI M8, or SEMI M24.2.7 For referee purposes, U.S. customary units shall beused for wafers of 2- and 3-inch nominal diameter andSI (System International), commonly called metric,units for 100 mm and larger diameter wafers.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use.

A1-1 PurposeA1-1.1 Silicon wafers are often subjected to reclaimprocesses, in order to improve manufacturing efficiencyin device production. This process can removesignificant material from the marked surface of a 300mm wafer. This can lead to reduced dot diameter formarks with v-shaped profile, to the point that themark no longer meets the requirements of SEMI T7.This can compromise the marks readability.A1-1.2 This specification is intended to identifylocations on the back surface of 300 mm reclaimedsilicon wafers for re-inscribing the SEMI T7 andoptionally the OCR (according to SEMI M1.15) lasermarks in order to maintain traceability after multiplereclaims. A1-2 ScopeA1-2.1 This specification defines the spatialrelationships for back surface marking of reclaimable orreclaimed notched, double-side polished 300 mmwafers of silicon with pre-existing manufacturersmarks which comply with SEMI M1.15.A1-2.2 Although this specification does not specify themarking equipment or techniques that may beemployed when complying with its requirements, it isrequired that the symbols be a hard mark obtained bylaser scribing individual dots with diameter as specifiedin SEMI T7.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use.

It was developed by the International 300mm Reclaim Remark Task Force during the development of the specification for multiple-laser marking of 300 mmpolished silicon reclaimed wafers. This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballotprocedures on August 16, 2004. R1-1 Multiple Laser Making IssuesR1-1.1 Issues related to multiple laser marking of 300mm silicon reclaimed wafers were explored at meetingsduring SEMICON West in San Francisco in July 2002,SEMICON Southwest in Austin in October 2002,SEMICON Japan in Tokyo in December 2002 and a day workshop during SEMICON Europa in Munich inApril 2003. Significant input from device makers,wafer reclaimers, and equipment suppliers wasreceived.R1-1.2 Four major issues emerged. R1-2 When Is a Remark Field Applied?R1-2.1 This could be at each reclaim cycle, or whenthe first mark is not readable at the reclaimer.R1-2.2 Because the latter is a difficult matter, it wasdecided to make this a decision of the purchaser. R1-3 Where Should the Remark Field(s) BeLocated?R1-3.1 A device manufacturer suggested that each newremark field be located 10\xb0 counter clockwise (CCW)from the previous mark field, and at the same radius.R1-3.2 A wafer with two of more fields isunambiguously identified as a reclaim wafer and then remarked fields it contains indicate the number ofreclaim cycles it has experienced, if it is remarked aftereach use. R1-4 What Is the Remark Fields Content?R1-4.1 Two scenarios are possible:R1-4.1.1 Different from the Original Mark  Forexample, retaining the ID # but changing the suppliercode from original to the reclaim suppliers code. Thiscould confuse a device fabs database when twoidentical ID numbers appear in the database unless italso includes the vendor code. Changing the IDnumber does not necessarily avoid this problem.R1-4.1.2 Same as the Original Mark  This simplifiesthe remark coding. However, the is still the possibilityof confusing the device manufacturers database. R1-4.2 It was decided to make this a decision of thepurchaser. R1-5 How to Disable a Previous Mark Field?R1-5.1 Disabling a mark field requires that a markfield be modified or obliterated sufficiently to ensurethe reader reports a no read.R1-5.2 It was decided to make both the requirement toobliterate the previous mark and the method ofobliteration decisions of the purchaser. R1-6 Mark Field Obliteration Comments.R1-6.1 Obliterating an entire field may not benecessary to make it unreadable. For the two markfields specified in SEMI M1.15, the following mayapply:R1-6.1.1 Data Matrix FieldR1-6.1.1.1 Reliable reading of this field requires aquiet zone (no surface disturbance) about four dotswide (400 m) around the field periphery. Filling thequiet zone with dots insures that the Data Matrix markcannot be read.R1-6.1.1.1.1 Surrounding the 8 row  32 column fieldwith a 4-dot border involves (8 + 32)  2  4 = 320dots.R1-6.1.1.1.2 A 3-dot border may work as well, andrequires 240 dots.R1-6.1.1.2 Conversely, overwriting the field involves8  32 = 306 dots.R1-6.1.1.2.1 A difference of 100 m (one dot) betweenthe positions of the overwrite field and original fieldshould still produce a no read.R1-6.1.1.2.2 Some position difference results from themarkers wafer alignment system. The alignmentcapability of deployed 300 mm markers is therefore aconsideration.R1-6.2 Alphanumeric FieldR1-6.2.1 Obliterating one or more message charactersand one or more check sum characters should make themark unreadable by both camera and human readers."),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 14 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M38-1104 \xa9 SEMI 1999, 200413 This requires completely overwriting each of thesecharacters with a filled 5  9 character field (45 dots atsingle density). It was suggested this be done at twoID characters (1 and 6 in the 12-character string) andone check sum character (12).R1-6.2.2 This overwriting involves 3 fields  45 dots =135 dots.R1-6.2.3 The alignment comments in Section R1-6.1.1.2.2 also apply to these fields. R1-7 Use of Remarked Reclaimed Wafers inDevice FabricationR1-7.1 This may involve two scenarios:R1-7.1.1 Incoming SearchR1-7.1.2 Determine the good remark field location(5 + ","[","10  n","]",") degrees from the notch bisector for eachwafer and store that data in the factory database. Thenthe manufacturing execution system commands a toolhandling that wafer to go to the appropriate fieldlocation. This minimizes or eliminates throughputeffects.NOTE 1: This requires variable read location capability (bywafer rotation, for instance) on the tool.R1-7.2 Local Tool SearchR1-7.2.1 When unable to read the original field, thetool scans counterclockwise until it finds a readablefield. This cycle can adversely impact tool throughput. NOTE 2: This requires Variable read location capability and Smart read, i.e., 3 levels, as follows: Good read (this is the right field, so keep thedata), Bad read (this is an obliterated field, go tonext location and try again), and No read (no mark is present, search somewhereelse).

These specifications refer to the roughness ofboth the final polished front and the back surfaces of awafer. Various techniques are currently used tomeasure the surface roughness of silicon wafers. Thesetechniques include AFM scanning probes, mechanicaland optical profiling, interferometric microscopes, andlight (electromagnetic radiation) scattering. Mechanicalprofiling techniques are widely used in other industriesand are well standardized. Profiling techniques aregenerally limited to line scans and therefore provideinformation of only a very small part of a surface.Interferometric techniques for roughness measurementsare similarly limited, whereas light scatteringtechniques can scan the entire wafer surface."),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 20 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M40-0200 \xa9 SEMI 2000 2 4.2 Historically a variety of rough ness parameters forprofiling techniques have evolved and have beenstandardized, including rms roughness (Rq) and averageroughness (Ra ). Profiling instruments measure thesurface topography and derive roughness statistics, suchas Rq, from a series of height data. Light scatteringtechniques measure Rq from the angular dependence ofscattering; some light scattering systems derive otherparameters through interpretation and estimation.4.3 A roughness value representat ive of an entirewafer surface, or a large portion of the surface, cannotbe based on data obtained at a single point. Yet,specifications often describe a single value for a wafer.Therefore, this guideline suggests and definesstandardized patterns of scan sites that can be describedand used unambiguously. A model describing therelationship between several types of roughnessvariation, scan patterns, and reported results is includedin the attached Related Information to assist users inspecifying and interpreting these variables.4.4 A common feature of all rough ness measurementsis their dependence on the bandwidth and transferfunction of the tool used. In addition, high or lowspatial frequency software filters are common andaffect reported results. Widely different numbers canbe reported for the same surface by two measurementinstruments. This guideline includes suggestions onspecifying and reporting the instrument bandwidth andtransfer function. 5 Referenced Standards5.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specifications for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI M20  Specification for Establishing a WaferCoordinate System 5.2 ASME Standard 1ASME B46.1  Surface Texture (Surface Roughness,Waviness, and Lay) 5.3 ASTM Standards 2E 1392  Practice for Angle Resolved Optical ScatterMeasurements on Specular or Diffuse SurfacesF 1048  Test Method for Measuring the EffectiveSurface Roughness of Optical Components by TotalIntegrated Scattering 1 American Society of Mechanical Engineers, United EngineeringCenter, 345 East 47th Street, New York, NY 100172 American Society for Testing and Materials, 100 Barr HarborDrive, West Conshohoken, PA 19428-2959 F 1620  Practice for Calibrating a Scanning SurfaceInspection System Using Monodisperse PolystyreneLatex Spheres Deposited on Polished or EpitaxialSurfacesF 1811  Estimating the Power Spectral DensityFunction and Related Finish Parameters from SurfaceProfile Data 5.4 DIN Standards 3DIN 4760  Form Deviation, Waviness, SurfaceRoughness; System of Order, Terms and DefinitionsDIN 4768  Determination of Values of SurfaceRoughness Parameters Ra, Rz, Rmax by Means ofElectrical Contact (Stylus) Instruments; Terminology,Measuring ConditionsDIN 4777  Metrology of Surfaces; Profile Filters forElectrical Contact Stylus Instruments; Phase-CorrectedFilters 5.5 ISO Standards 4ISO 468  Surface Roughness  Parameters, TheirValues and General Rules for Specifying RequirementsISO 1879  Instrument for the Measurement ofSurface Roughness by the Profile Method - VocabularyISO 1880  Instruments for the Measurement ofSurface Roughness by the Profile Method - Contact(Stylus) Instruments of Progressive ProfileTransformation - Profile Recording InstrumentsISO 3274  Instruments for the Measurement ofSurface Roughness by the Profile Method  Contact(Stylus) Instrument of Consecutive ProfileTransformation  Contact Profile Meters, System MISO 4287/1  Surface roughness  Terminology  Part1: surface and its parametersISO 4288  Rules and Procedures for theMeasurement of Surface Roughness Using StylusInstruments 5.6 JIS Standards 5JIS B 0601  Surface Roughness - Definitions AndDesignationJIS B 0652  Instruments For The Measurement OfSurface Roughness By The Interferometric MethodJIS B 0659  Roughness Comparison Specimens 3 Deutches Institut fr Normung e.V., Beuth Verlag GmbH,Burggrafenstrasse 4-10, D-10787 Berlin, Germany4 ISO Central Secretariat, 1, rue de Varemb, Case postale 56, CH-1211 Genve 20, Switzerland5 Japanese Standards Association, 1-24, Akasaka, 4-Chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo 107 Japan"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 21 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M40-0200 \xa9 SEMI 20003 5.7 Other DocumentsInternational Technology Roadmap forSemiconductors 6 Optical Scattering in the Optics, Semiconductor, andComputer Disk Industries, Second Edition 1995, J CStover, Editor 7 NOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 6 Terminology6.1 autocorrelation function  th e Fourier transformof the Power Spectral Density function.

The high spatial frequency limit ofsuch tools has to be set or selected reasonably removedfrom that limit in order to achieve reasonable,comparable, and repeatable measurements.7.2 Interference Microscope7.2.1 The high spatial frequency lim it of theseinstruments is defined by the focusing optics or in somecases by the pixel spacing of the detector array. Thehigh spatial frequency limit of such tools has to be setor selected reasonably removed from that limit in orderto achieve reasonable, comparable, and repeatablemeasurements.7.3 Scattering Instruments7.3.1 A straightforward relation betw een scatteredlight intensity and roughness exists only for sufficientlysmooth surfaces.

Also, the slope of the PSDcurve can be important in certain situations (Stover).7.3.5 There is a basic high spatial fr equency (shortspatial wavelength) limit for light scattering tools whichcannot be exceeded. This limit is: a) twice the inverse wavelength,2 , of the light used in case of grazing incidence (i = 90\xb0), and b) one inverse wavelength,1 , in the case of normal incidence (i = 0\xb0).These conditions follow directly from the one-dimensional grating equation  issxf coscossin = where: s = scattering angle in the incident plane,ands = scattering angle out of the plane-of-incidence.NOTE 3: f x becomes -1 when the light is scattered back in thedirection of the incoming light in the incident plane (s =180o). 7.4 Total Integrating Scatteromete rs (TIS)7.4.1 These instruments most often use an incidenceangle close to zero. The low and high frequency limitsof the accessible spatial bandwidth are defined by thedesign of the optical system. An appropriatelydesigned system may be able to access a spatialbandwidth from about 0.8 m to about 40 m. Thesesystems may also be designed so that the scatteredsignal can be broken into low spatial frequency (nearspecular) and high spatial frequency (large scatter angle) bands.7.5 Angle-resolved Light Scatterom eters (ARLS)7.5.1 The high spatial frequency lim it of this techniqueis defined by incident and scattering angles and theillumination wavelength used.7.5.2 The low spatial frequency limi t is given by the above equations (for incidence angle), the diameter of the incident illumination spot at thewafer surface, the solid collection angle of the optical system, and the smallest angular distance allowed by theinstrument between specular reflected light and thedetector.7.5.3 The roughness may be measur ed by using afixed incidence angle and by recording the intensity ofscattered light at various scattering angles in the planeof incidence. The two-dimensional PSD curve of thesurface can then be calculated from the angularspectrum of the scattered light (BRDF). Rq as well asmq may be calculated from a one-dimensional orisotropic PSD curve for a given spatial bandwidth aslong as the above mentioned limits are accommodated.7.5.4 Such tools may be able to acce ss a spatialbandwidth range of about one-half the wavelength ofthe illuminating light up to several hundred m.7.6 Scanning Surface Inspection S ystems (SSIS)7.6.1 SSIS measurements are integra ted scattermeasurements similar to those made by TIS systems, inthat they gather light over large solid angles; however,there are some significant differences. In general, mostSSIS avoid light collection within five to ten degrees ofthe specular beam, because in this region the scattertends to be dominated by surface roughness scatter(which becomes background noise) competing with thesignal from laser light scattering events. The early(older) scanners generally had one detector measuringlight from a very large solid angle collector. Latersystems tend to use several smaller collection angles,each with their own detector. Whatever thearrangement, each collection angle can be defined interms of its spatial frequency band pass region, andeach detector will have some background hazecomponent (or threshold) that is caused by surfaceroughness. Thus, in the absence of laser light scatteringevents, measured haze may be converted to an rmsroughness for the defined spatial frequencies. Thisconversion assumes that the surface meets thenecessary (smooth, clean, front surface reflective)conditions required for roughness calculations, and that"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 24 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M40-0200 \xa9 SEMI 2000 6 other noise sources, such as background electronicnoise and Rayleigh air scatter, are not issues. 8 Roughness Measurement s8.1 Parameters8.1.1 Rq and Ra are generally used fo r silicon wafersurfaces. Other roughness measurement parametersmay also prove useful. This guideline does not suggestwhich parameters to use, rather it suggests how toincorporate any parameter into a standardizedmeasurement specification.8.2 Measurement Sites8.2.1 Roughness can vary considera bly across a wafersurface. It may also have a preferential direction oranisotropy, often called lay (ASME B46.1). Manymeasurement techniques are limited to a very smallmeasurement area and to one or two scan directions.Therefore specific measurement patterns must bedefined to obtain representative and reproducibleresults. These patterns should correspond to effectsobserved on wafers in different manufacturing steps.These processing steps can generate features on a wafersurface with rotational symmetries ranging from mirrorto infinite. The wafer slicing process may produce lowsymmetry, while single-wafer polishing can producehigh symmetry.8.2.2 In cases where only a small nu mber of spots ismeasured, the spot pattern and the scan orientation haveto be identified. See Figure 1 for some patterns andorientations; others may be agreed upon betweeninterested parties.8.3 Site Patterns8.3.1 One-point  This can be usef ul for rapidlyreviewing results of a quantity of wafers. This is oftenat the wafer centerpoint.8.3.2 In applications where only a sm all number oflocations are to be measured, the pattern and orientationof the local scans have to be identified. Measurementsare performed at locations as outlined in Figure 1. Foreach local scan, a representative roughness iscalculated. The wafers representative roughness isthen a function of the n individual representative scanvalues. The roughness variation can be calculated bythe average, the standard deviation, the maximum or therange (Max-Min) of the individual scan values. Otherstatistical approaches may be employed.8.3.3 Standard patterns include:a. 1-point Wafer center,b. 5-point Wafer Center plus four points at 2r/3from the wafer center, and c. 9-point Wafer Center plus four points at 2r/5and four at 4r/5 from the wafer center.NOTE 4: These patterns have been shown to be useful with arange of symmetries and values. See Related Information. 8.3.4 Standard measurement orienta tion patternsinclude:a. Type A - linear scans parallel and perpendicularto the fiducial bisector, andb. Type B - linear scans at 45o relative to thefiducial bisector.NOTE 5: Type A is generally used for all surfaces. Type Bhas been reported to be useful for some surface conditions on(111) wafers. 8.4 Bandwidth8.4.1 Two issues affect the bandwid th of theroughness results. The first is the bandwidth of theroughness measuring tool, which is discussed in Section7. The second bandwidth effect is from the analysissoftware, which is user selected to emphasize certainspatial frequencies. Both long and short spatialwavelength (or frequency) limits must be defined in m(or m-1 ). When entering this information into ameasurement, specification wavelength units shall beused. Profiling instruments should have scan lengthand bandwidth adjusted according to DIN 4768 and4777 or ASME B46.1.8.5 Precision8.5.1 The precision of the roughness measuringinstrument (P) is important. The relationship betweenP and the tolerance of the parts to be characterized (T)is often called the P/T Ratio. SEMI M27 describes howto determine and interpret the factors: A testinstrument is usually deemed to be suitable for thepurpose if P/T lies below 10%. If P/T is greater than30%, the test instrument is not likely to be suitable forthe purpose. Cases for which P/T lies between 10%and 30% must be judged on an individual basis,depending on the requirements being placed on themeasurement system. 9 Roughness Measurement Specifications9.1 The process of defining the me asurements to betaken involves several distinct steps.

R1-1 Executive SummaryR1-1.1 Roughness is measured traditionally only onselected spots on a surface and only a few methods,such as light scattering, are practical for a completesurface scan. Therefore a systematic, standardizedapproach is required for defining the roughness of theentire surface of a silicon wafer. This can be done bydefining one or several patterns of measurement spotswhich represent the entire surface so that the deviationof the average roughness and its standard deviationfrom the true values are small. The task of findingsuch patterns and verifying that they represent the entiresurface was approached in two steps: 1. byinvestigating various patterns on various wafer surfacesexperimentally, and 2. by simulating the roughness mapof surfaces and by applying the selected patterns tothem.R1-1.2 Five different site patterns were used for theexperimental investigation of silicon wafer surfaceswhich were final polished, stock removal polished andacid etched. The patterns consist of one, five, nine, tenand thirteen points (thirteen being the sum of a five andnine point pattern), respectively, and the measurementswere performed with 10, 30, 80 and 250 m filterlengths. Therefore 20 average roughness values andcorresponding standard deviations were obtained forevery wafer investigated, five for any filter length.R1-1.3 Haze maps of these surfaces either displayed novariation, variations with an approximately rotationalsymmetry or a gradient across the surface, respectively.The average roughness of the surfaces measured withthe various site patterns varied over four and a halforders of magnitude for the set of wafers used and thefilter settings selected. The corresponding standarddeviations were found to be ","<","10% of the averageroughness with the exception of four 200 mm finalpolished wafers where standard deviations up to 50-60% occurred. The 5-, 9- and 10-point site patternswere compared with respect to the average roughnessand the corresponding standard deviation for everywafer. The variation (standard deviation) of theaverage roughness and the standard deviations asmeasured were found to be smaller than orapproximately 10% in any case when normalized to thetotal average roughness of the corresponding wafer(average over all points of all patterns for a wafer). R1-1.4 Roughness maps were generated for thesimulation according to three different models: mapswith a roughness pattern with rotational symmetry, witha linear gradient and with mirror symmetry. Two mapswith a pixel size of 1 mm2 were generated for eachsurface to take into account any anisotropy of theroughness, and center roughness and edge roughness,respectively, were used as free parameters for bothmaps. These parameters were varied between two level(0.1 and 0.2) for both maps resulting in a 2 5 factorialdesign of experiment where the symmetry wasconsidered as 5 th parameter. The 1-, 5- and 9-point sitepatterns were applied to the various maps and theaverage roughness and standard deviation of roughnesswere calculated as well as the true values using allpoints of a map. Strong effects were observed for the1-point pattern. As expected one point in the wafercenter does in general not represent the averageroughness of the entire surface reasonably well. The 5-point measurement provides the correct average \xb1 6%,the 9-point measurement is \xb1 2.5%. Similarly, the 5-point standard deviation is correct \xb1 1.6% and the 9-point one is \xb1 1%. Second order effects were found tobe smaller than the main effects. Therefore it isconcluded that the suggested five and nine pointmeasurement patterns provide a good estimate of theroughness of an entire surface and its variations forreasonably homogeneous Si wafer surfaces. R1-2 IntroductionR1-2.1 Roughness measurement of surfaces isperformed with a variety of techniques, the mostcommon ones being mechanical or optical profiling inreal space or light scattering in reciprocal space (1,2,3).The numerical result of a roughness measurementprocess depends significantly on several parameterssuch as spatial bandwidth of the response function ofthe tool used including filtering, scan length, probediameter, scanning speed etc. These parameters are notindependent of each other and have been standardizedonly for mechanical profilers (e.g.4,5). The roughnessvalues reported by different types of tools usually donot agree but they correlate provided their parameterswere set up not too differently (6). The standardizedroughness metrics such as average roughness Ra orroot-mean-square roughness Rq refer mainly to linescans as performed by profiling techniques (e.g. 7).Area scans performed by profiling tools by aligning aseries of line scans are usually very slow. Scanning theentire surface of a Si wafer with a profiler therefore"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 32 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M40-0200 \xa9 SEMI 2000 14 would consume many hours, in the case of AFM(Atomic Force Microscope) many years.R1-2.2 Techniques based on light scattering arecapable of scanning the entire wafer surface quiterapidly, in about 1-2 min. Their response function,however, has a limited spatial bandwidth rangingapproximately from 0.5 to 40 m. Standards for lightscattering measurements are now emerging (8,9).R1-2.3 The obvious solution for obtaining astandardized roughness value of an entire surface is a)to define a pattern of sites where one- or two-dimensional scans are performed and b) to report thesignificant parameters along with the measurement(roughness) result. The second task can be solvedtheoretically by collecting the important parameters andby designing an appropriate abbreviation code. Thefirst task requires experiments to collect data about thevariation of roughness across a typical, real wafersurface and numerical simulations to find a set of sitesthe roughness of which agrees sufficiently well with theroughness of the entire surface.R1-2.4 This appendix reports the results ofcorresponding roughness measurements as well as of anumerical simulation using a virtual design-of-experiment (DOX).R1-3 Roughness DefinitionsR1-3.1 A variety of definitions for roughness havebeen standardized by national and internationalinstitutions in the US, Japan and Europe.Corresponding standards are listed in section 5 of themain document and some selected ones again inreference 7. Most widely used are average roughnessRa and root-mean-square roughness Rq. Both refer tothe average deviation of a profile from a reference line. R1-4 Roughness MeasurementsR1-4.1 Experimental DetailsR1-4.1.1 Four groups of four wafers each wereinvestigated to collect data about the variation ofroughness across the wafer surface.

R1-4.1.2 The wafers were characterized for haze withan SSIS (Censor ANS-100) and the roughnessmeasurements were performed with an optical non-contact profiler (Chapman MP-2000+). The roughnessdata were taken by performing scans of length 3 mmand were evaluated using filters of 19, 30, 80 and 250m, respectively.

The results are summarized in Tables R1-1 and R1-3.These averages and standard deviations are called site average or site standard deviation for the respective sitepatterns for each wafer and each filter length applied.R1-4.2.2 The variation in average values obtained with the different site patterns employed can be obtained bycalculating 1) the average ofthe individual site averages and the standard deviation for each wafer and 2) the averageof the individual site standard deviations and the corresponding standard deviation. These averages are called waferaverage and wafer standard deviation, respectively. The corresponding standard deviations are called standarddeviation of wafer average and standard deviation of wafer standard deviation. They are reported in Table R1-3 andTable R1-5 and in Figure R1-2 and Figure R1-3.R1-4.2.3 The site average roughness values found range from 0.09 A for final polished wafers to 350 A for acidetched wafers for a 10 m filter and from about 5 A to 2200 A, respectively, for a 250 m filter. In total, a range ofabout four and a half orders of magnitude is covered. The site standard deviation for the different site patterns isaround 10-15% of the average roughness of the wafer indicating a homogeneous roughness of the wafer surfaces.The difference between the site patterns ii, iii, iv and v for the relative site standard deviation is small, typicallyabout 1-2 %. Exceptions are for the 200 mm final polished wafers with standard deviations of about 50-60% for the10 m filter.R1-4.2.4 According to the values in Tables R1-3 & R1-5, the standard deviations of the wafer averages are less than10 % in any case (Figure RI). The standard deviations of the various site standard deviations (Figure A3) are alsosmaller than or about 10 % with respect to the wafer average. This indicates that in the present case any site patternwith the exception of the single site measurement at the wafer centerrepresents the true mean roughness ofthe entire surface and its standard deviation reasonably well.

Therefore approximationshave to be found which represent the roughness of anentire wafer surface with appropriate accuracy. Threediscrete site patterns were defined in section 9 of SEMIM40, which are thought to provide suchapproximations. Performing many measurements usingthese site patterns is one approach to assess these sitepatterns with respect to their validity. Anotherapproach is to simulate roughness variations across awafer surface and apply the site patterns to them. Thisallows easy and systematic variations of the surfaceroughness properties and maps. The assessment of theresults again has to be performed in a systematic way.An appropriate tool for doing this is to utilize a factorialdesign for the variables in the various surface modelsused. The goal of finding a site pattern whichrepresents the entire surface is considered to beachieved when the variations of the variables of thedifferent surface models result in a non-significanteffect in the evaluation of the factorial design.R1-5.2 Simulation of Roughness MapsR1-5.2.1 The measurement results that are reported insection 3 provide some insight into the variation ofroughness that occurs across actual, typical wafersurfaces. The variation observed on the differentwafers is related to the specific polishing technique(wax mount polishing, wax free polishing) and to thepolishing parameters used. Examination of haze mapsreveals three basic patterns of variation:a) a circularly symmetric haze variationb) a haze variation approximately symmetric withrespect to a diameter across the waferc) a linear gradient of haze from one wafer edge tothe opposite one. R1-5.2.2 The following relations were used to simulatethe variation of roughness according to these three basic models a)-c) with e and c being the roughness valuesnear the edge and at the center of a wafer, respectively:model a: a parabolic relationz(x,y) = (x2+y2) (e-c)/r 2 + c (equ. 1)model b: a semi-cylindrical relationz(x,y) = (r 2-(y cos a  x sin a) 2) 1/2 (e-c)/r + e(equ. 2)model c: a linear gradientz(x,y) = (y cos a - x sin a) (e-c)/r + c (equ. 3)with wafer radius r and angle  corresponding to theangle between the symmetry plane and the x-direction(model b) or the direction of the gradient and the y-direction (model c).R1-5.2.3 Using equations 1-3, roughness maps ofwafer surfaces can be generated with a roughness valueassigned to each site. This was performed by usingMathCad\xae software and by assuming 200 mm wafers,the area of each being partitioned into sites of 1 mm2size.R1-5.2.4 Roughness is not necessarily an isotropicproperty of a surface. Different roughness values are ingeneral obtained when e.g. two scans are performed atthe same spot on a wafer surface but in perpendiculardirections. Therefore two maps representing theroughness anisotropy were generated in each case byassuming two sets of the parameters e and c  e1, c1,e2, and c2, per wafer surface.R1-5.3 Factorial DesignR1-5.3.1 A factorial design at two levels was selectedin order to compare the various wafer maps generated(10). The parameters ei and ci (i = 1,2) were used asvariables and were varied between two levels, 0.1 and0.2, in arbitrary units.

Average roughness and standard deviation were calculated by using all pixels of a map(avgtrue, stdabwtrue) as well as by using the three discrete site patterns displayed in Figure 1 of the main part of thisdocument (avg1, avg5, avg9, stdabw5, stdabw9). Corresponding results for comparing models a and b are displayedin Table R1-6. These values were normalized for further evaluation, the averages with respect to avgtrue(ravgi=avgi/avgtrue, i=1,5,9), the standard deviations with respect to their difference to the true value((rstdabwi=stdabwi.-stdabwtrue) / stdabwtrue, i=5,9) (Table R1-7). Results for comparing models a and c aresimilar and are not reported here in detail.R1-5.3.3 The averages for ravg1,5,9 over the various variable sets differ by less than 1% from unity. Thecorresponding standard deviations decrease from 27% to 5% going from ravg1 to ravg9, respectively, indicating as one would expect  that ravg9 is a much more precise value for the roughness of the entire surface as comparedto ravg1 or ravg5. The relative standard deviations rstdabw5,9 deviate in the average by about 12% from the truevalue. The corresponding standard deviations differ not much for rstdabw5 and rstdabw9.R1-5.3.4 More detailed information is obtained when the results are evaluated according to the factorial designused. The 1 st to 5 th order effects of varying the variables were calculated by applying using a table of contrastcoefficients /10/ to the normalized results of the simulation. The 1st order  or main  effects are the difference ofthe observations for both levels of one parameter and averages over all other observations. They measure theaverage effect of a variable over all conditions of the other variables. The 2nd order effects are a measure for theinteraction of variables and are obtained by calculating one half of the difference of the average effect of variable 1with variable 2 at level 1 and variable 1 with variable 2 at level 2. 3rd order and higher effects are not considered inthe present work. They are assumed to be negligible and are used to calculate the variance of an effect (=square rootof the average of the squares of 3 rd to 5 th order effects).R1-5.3.5 The result of this evaluation is displayed in Table R1-8 and Table R1-9 for the main (1st order) and 2 ndorder effects, respectively.

The parameters of the models  roughnessin the center and near the edge of the wafer  were used as variables in a factorial design and varied between twolevels. Average roughness and the corresponding standard deviations calculated for the site patterns were comparedwith the true values obtained by evaluating all points of the roughness map.R1-5.4.2 The patterns where the roughness is measured at five or nine points exhibit a standard deviation of 7 and 5%, respectively, from the true average value for all possible combinations of the variables. The average of thestandard deviations of the roughness distribution of the single variable sets differs by about 13% from the true valuefor the five- as well as nine-point site pattern. A standard deviation of the standard deviations of about 11% isobtained by averaging over the 32 different variables sets.R1-5.4.3 The evaluation of the factorial design outlines that the variation of the variables c1, c2, e1, and e2 has asignificant effect  with respect to noise  on the average roughness values but not on the corresponding standarddeviations. Varying the surface model does not significantly affect the averages and standard deviations. Somesecond order effects or interactions are also significant but less pronounced than the main effects. A pronouncedinteraction of the variables c1 and c2 occurs e.g. for the five point standard deviation rstdabw5. This interactioncould be reduced by introducing an additional site for measuring roughness in the center of the wafer with adirection perpendicular to the present one.R1-5.4.4 The goal of finding a site pattern which results only in non-significant effects is not completely achievedby the five and nine point patterns utilized in the present work. However, they allow to measure the averageroughness of wide variety of surface roughness distributions with a one sigma deviation of 5-7 %, or a three sigmadeviation of 15-21 %. These values are certainly more than sufficient for present wafer surfaces."),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 43 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M40-0200 \xa9 SEMI 200025 R1-6 Related DocumentsASTM E 1392  Practice for Angle Resolved Optical Scattering Measurements on Specular or Diffuse SurfacesASTM F 1048  Test Method for Measuring the Effective Surface Roughness of Optical Components by TotalIntegrated ScatteringJ.M.

This insulatorlayer is typically thermally grown silicon-dioxide.4.2.3 bonding interface  the plane where the bondingbetween the two wafers takes place.4.2.4 buried oxide layer (BOX)  the insulator layerbetween the two wafers when the insulator layer issilicon-dioxide.4.2.5 non-SOI edge area  an annulus between thenominal radius of the surface silicon layer and thenominal radius of the base silicon wafer (for bondedSOI wafers). The annulus which implies an area isdetermined by its width as one dimension. It is thedifference in the nominal radius of the surface siliconlayer and that of the base silicon wafer.4.2.6 thickness of top silicon film  the distancebetween the surface of the top silicon film and the topsilicon film-buried oxide interface.4.2.7 top silicon film  the silicon layer on top of theinsulator film in which the semiconductor activedevices are fabricated.4.2.8 void  the absence of a chemical bond at thebonding interface. 5 Ordering Information5.1 Purchase orders for bonded wafers furnished to thisspecification shall include the following items:5.1.1 Substrate Characteristics for the device layer(diameter, dopant, orientation, resistivity, Oi, etc.)5.1.2 Substrate Characteristics for the base wafer(diameter, thickness, dopant, orientation, resistivity,etc.) 3 Japanese Electronic and Information Technology IndustriesAssociation, Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry Bldg. 2-2,Marunouchi 3-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-0005, Japan.
