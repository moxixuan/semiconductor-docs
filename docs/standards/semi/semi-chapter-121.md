This is still qualitative, and can be quantified ingeneral cases by overlaying the actual line contour tothe nominal line (see Section 8.4). Alternatively, a testpattern such as Figure 17 may overcome the need tooverlay to the nominal case.NOTE 28: line-end is also used for the darkfield case (forspaces).NOTE 29: In non-corrected isolated cases normally there isonly a loss (or shortening). In other cases (i.e., corrected line-ends) there may be a loss and a gain (or extension), whichmakes it necessary to also define the difference and deviation,as done below.NOTE 30: The minimum (= DEFAULT) region of interestmust include all feature area divergence until the feature canbe treated as one-dimensional (see Sections 5.3 and 5.4).

Mandatoryinformation for each of the 4 above: actual and nominal width, tone, pitch (or surrounding area), and orientation.DEFAULT: isolated feature (line or space).NOTE 31: As the line-end shape is expected not to bedecisive for its printability, but rather the balance betweenarea gain and loss, it is recommended to use area differencefor line-end qualification rather than area deviation.8.2.4.6 line-end pull-back (LEPB)  the distance,parallel to the line center, between the line-ends of thenominal and the actual features (see Figure 15). Thisdistance may be determined along the line center(center LEPB), or alternatively it may be determined bythe distance between the extreme point of the actualline and the nominal line-end (minimum LEPB), inanalogy to corner pull-back. Mandatory information is: actual and nominal width, tone, pitch (or surrounding area), orientation, and choice of LEPB technique (center or minimum).DEFAULT: isolated feature.NOTE 32: Edge roughness may have an important influenceon the line-end pull-back, such that contour averaging may benecessary to produce a meaningful result. The contouraveraging method is mandatory info for LEPB, if done.8.2.4.7 equivalent line-end pull-back (ELEPB) defined as the negative line-end area difference dividedby the nominal line width (see Figure 16), assumingaccurate 1D control (see Section 8.1).NOTE 33: This definition actually gives a 1D representationfor a 2D quality assessement, but it is found useful whencomparing mask quality to wafer printing results, which aretypically characterized by 1D measurements, such that adimensionless MEEF (mask error enhancement factor) can beused. As with area based assessment, also this termdisregards the shape at the line-end.NOTE 34: LEPB and ELES are positive when the actual lineis shorter than the nominal line. A negative sign is added incase of over-correction, when the actual line becomes longerthan the nominal line.8.2.5 Specific Case of Contacts and DotsNOTE 35: This sub-section explains terminology for contactsin full detail. This terminology can analogously be extendedto dots.8.2.5.1 contact area  special case of feature area, inwhich the feature is a contact (see Figure 18a). 8.2.5.2 contact area gain  special case of featurearea gain, in which the region of interest contains acontact (see Figure 18b).8.2.5.3 contact area loss  special case of featurearea loss, in which the region of interest contains acontact (see Figure 18b).8.2.5.4 contact area difference  contact area gainminus contact area loss. As such it becomes a specialcase of feature area difference, in which region ofinterest contains a contact.8.2.5.5 contact area deviation  the sum of contactarea gain and contact area loss. As such it becomes aspecial case of feature area deviation, in which theregion of interest contains a contact. Mandatoryinformation for each of the 4 above: nominal width in X and Y (Y not required forsquare contacts), nominal area (not required for square orrectangular contacts), and pitch (or the surroundings).NOTE 36: The absolute value of the above qualificationparameters can be normalized to the nominal contact area,i.e., normalized contact area deviation and normalizedcontact area difference.NOTE 37: As the contact shape is expected not to be decisivefor its printability, but rather the balance between area gainand loss, it is recommended to use area difference for contactqualification rather than area deviation.8.2.5.6 contact X-width (or contact Y-width)  widthin X (or Y) of the smallest rectangle along X (or Y)encompassing the contact (see Figure18c).8.2.5.7 contact diagonal widths  widths determinedusing the smallest rectangle encompassing the contactconfined along the directions± arctan(WY,nominal/W X,nominal) (see Figure 18d), which is± 45degrees for square contacts.NOTE 38: Edge roughness may have an important influenceon the 1D determination of contact width (X-, Y-, diagonal-),such that contour averaging may be necessary to produce ameaningful result. The contour averaging method used ismandatory information for contact width and contact diagonalwidth, as its influence is increasingly important for smallercontacts (see Note 43 in Section 8.5).8.2.6 Specific Case of Optical Proximity Correction(OPC)8.2.6.1 This document recommends to treat OPCdfeatures or patterns as a special case of Section 8.2.1(based on area). OPC fidelity is based on normalizedpattern area deviation and normalized pattern areadifference.

By analogyto the transition from feature width to feature widthuniformity, any 2D qualification parameter may beadditionally characterized by uniformity. Below, as anexample, corner area difference uniformity iselaborated.8.2.7.2 corner area difference uniformity  the spreadof the distribution of the corner area difference of allmask features selected as described below. To be statedas mandatory information in addition to that of cornerrounding (Section 8.2.3.1) and also adopting the sameDEFAULTS: the criterion used (range, 3-sigma, maximum areadifference, etc.), where sigma stands for standarddeviation.(Recommendation: before 3-sigma is relevant, thedistribution needs to be normal or near normal,and the number of measurements should be &gt; 30.)

It isrecommended to limit 2D characterization to features

Thiscorrection should be done before 2D-parameterdetermination, and feature linearity errors (feature proximity errors),using the same sizing corrections as in 8.3.2b, butbased on specific feature width deviation.8.3.2.1 What was modified and how it was done, ismandatory information.NOTE 41: Scaling is not permitted.NOTE 42: Sizing algorithm to be mentioned: orthogonally,by circular brush, perpendicularly, etc. (see Figure 21).DEFAULT is compensation a and b1.

(a) (b)Figure 22Alignment of nominal and actual feature(a) by center of gravity (COG) only, left is theintended overlay, right is actual overlay from theCOG method, leading to an incorrect result.(b) by the use of alignment markers. 8.4.3 Alignment is preferably done on dedicatedalignment features (markers), which are symmetric andnot clipped, and their position does not suffer from theresolution of the imaging process. Crosses are typicallyused, as they have X and Y components, which can beused to correct for rotational error if only one markerwere present.8.4.4 Additional markers allow for more accuraterotational compensation and decouple magnificationerrors of the feature to be measured from sizing errors.8.4.5 If no markers are present, one of the methodsabove can be attempted on the feature to be measured or on other features in the ROI, but in such situationalignment may be less accurate, especially if thesefeatures are clipped (see Figure 22).8.5 Measured Values8.5.1 By analogy to Section 7 (1D Mask QualificationTerminology) a measured qualification parameter canbe defined for every 2D (true) qualification parameterdefined in Section 8.2. In Section 7 this was doneimmediately after the definition of the true parameter,whereas here the measured parameter is treated in ageneric way. Thereby, one 2D qualification parameteris used for the explanation, i.e., measured corner areadifference and its uniformity, as examples for all other2D qualification parameters and their uniformity.NOTE 43: The most critical feature in terms of impact of themeasurement details to the measured values is the size of acontact near the resolution limit of the metrology tool and ofthe mask patterning process.8.5.2 measured corner area difference  measuredvalue of corner area difference, stating as mandatoryinformation, in addition to that of corner rounding(Section 8.2.3.1): calibration method used 4, measurement method used (SEM, opticalreflection, optical transmission, AFM, etc.) and itsresolution limit, edge detection algorithm and parameters, precision (SEMI P24),and as optional information : measurement tool (vendor, model or any toolspecific options).8.5.3 measured corner area difference uniformity measured value of corner area difference uniformity,thereby stating as mandatory information in addition tothat of corner area difference uniformity and ofmeasured corner area difference: the number of measurement points used,and as optional information: the spatial distribution of measurement locations,e.g., by coordinates of measurement locations.DEFAULT is spread evenly over the measurementarea.NOTE 44: Edge roughness, either originating from theprocess (Note 19 in Section 8.2.2) or from the measurementtechnique used, may influence the measurement result. Thisis not the case for the two examples treated above, as thedifference parameter filters out the effect of roughness by 4 See reference document in Section 4.2.

The minimum wet outrequirement shall be 100% of the die perimeter. Silver Glass or Resin Bonding  100% dieperimeter coverage shall be required.NOTE 10: 100% coverage for silver glass or resin bonding isnot a function of base acceptability but is required tostandardize die shear testing. The inability of the resins to wetthe surface of the die attach area due to contamination iscause for rejection.10.2.1.2 Die Shear Test  Perform des tructive testingin accordance with MIL-STD-883, Method 2019.NOTE 11: Test may also be performed after environmentaltesting. In the case of very large die, this test may not beappropriate to fully evaluate the package. In these cases, diesizes agreed upon between user and supplier shall be used.Alternatively, die pull testing may be used by agreementbetween user and supplier. Inspection for die attach voids maybe performed radiographically in accordance with Section10.2.1.3 in order to ensure that the die attach process does notcontribute to an incorrect evaluation of the shear or pull testresults. In the case of eutectic die attach, the results fromthese methods may also be indicative of poor functionality ofthe gold die-attach metallization.10.2.1.3 Void Inspection  Inspection for die-attachvoids may be performed radiographically in accordancewith MIL-STD-883.
