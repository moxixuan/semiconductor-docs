SPECIFICATION FOR DIMENSION OF TWO PORT COMPONENTS
(EXCEPT MFC/MFM) FOR 1.125 INCH TYPE TWO FASTENER
CONFIGURATION SURFACE MOUNT GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS
This specification was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility of
the  Japanese  Gases  &  Facilities  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  Japanese  Regional  Standards
Committee  on  November  20,  2003.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  February  2004;  to  be  published
March 2004.
1  Purpose
1. 1        This    standard    establishes    the    properties    and
physical  dimensions  of  two  port  components  for  1.125
inch type surface mount gas distribution systems.
2  Scope
2. 1      This   document   includes   common   requirements,
layout,  size,  detailed  specifications,  and  dimensions  of
the components.
2. 2    This  standard  applies  to  all  two  port  two  fastener
components  (except  mass  flow  controllers  and  mass
flow  meters). The  components  (i.e.  valves,  pressure
regulators,  pressure  transducers,  filters  and  purifiers)
are  mounted  on  substrates  with  fasteners  accessible
from the top.
2. 3    This  standard  only  applies  to  components,  which
control flow of ≤ 50 slm nitrogen equivalent at 308 kPa
(44.7   psia).      This   standard   also   only   applies   to
components  with  operating  pressures  less  than  3445
kPa (500 psia) at 20°C.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1    This  standard  only  addresses  the  component;  it
does  not  address  the  seals,  the  sealing  system,  or  the
assembly    process    and    does    not    guarantee    the
performance of the sealing system.  The user should be
aware that gas delivery system performance and sealing
system  performance  are  addressed  elsewhere  in  the
SEMI standards.
3. 2        The    user    should    be    aware    that    alternative
technologies are commercially available.
3. 3  International, national, and local codes, regulations,
and   laws   should   be   consulted   to   ensure   that   the
equipment   meets   regulatory   requirements   in   each
location of use.

SEMI F87-0304
SPECIFICATION FOR DIMENSION OF THREE PORT COMPONENTS
(EXCEPT MFC/MFM) FOR 1.125 INCH TYPE FOUR FASTENER
CONFIGURATION SURFACE MOUNT GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS
This specification was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility of
the  Japanese  Gases  &  Facilities  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  Japanese  Regional  Standards
Committee  on  November  20,  2003.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  February  2004;  to  be  published
March 2004.
1  Purpose
1. 1        This    standard    establishes    the    properties    and
physical  dimensions  of  two  port  components  for  1.125
inch type surface mount gas distribution system.
2  Scope
2. 1      This   document   includes   common   requirements,
layout,  size,  detailed  specifications,  and  dimensions  of
the components.
2. 2  This standard applies to all three port four fastener
components  (except  mass  flow  controllers  and  mass
flow  meters). The  components  (i.e.  valves,  pressure
regulators,  pressure  transducers,  filters  and  purifiers)
are  mounted  on  substrates  with  fasteners  accessible
from the top.
2. 3    This  standard  only  applies  to  components,  which
control flow of ≤ 50 slm nitrogen equivalent at 308 kPa
(44.7   psia).      This   standard   also   only   applies   to
components  with  operating  pressures  less  than  3445
kPa (500 psia) at 20°C.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1    This  standard  only  addresses  the  component;  it
does  not  address  the  seals,  the  sealing  system,  or  the
assembly    process    and    does    not    guarantee    the
performance of the sealing system.  The user should be
aware that gas delivery system performance and sealing
system  performance  are  addressed  elsewhere  in  the
SEMI standards.
3. 2        The    user    should    be    aware    that    alternative
technologies are commercially available.
3. 3  International, national, and local codes, regulations,
and   laws   should   be   consulted   to   ensure   that   the
equipment   meets   regulatory   requirements   in   each
location of use.

to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1    This  standard  only  addresses  the  component;  it
does  not  address  the  seals,  the  sealing  system,  or  the
assembly    process    and    does    not    guarantee    the
performance of the sealing system.  The user should be
aware that gas delivery system performance and sealing
system  performance  are  addressed  elsewhere  in  the
SEMI standards.
3. 2        The    user    should    be    aware    that    alternative
technologies are commercially available.
3. 3  International, national, and local codes, regulations,
and   laws   should   be   consulted   to   ensure   that   the
equipment   meets   regulatory   requirements   in   each
