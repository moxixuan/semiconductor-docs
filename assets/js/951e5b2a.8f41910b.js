Original edition published by ASTM International as ASTM F\n1188-88.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1188-02.\nINTRODUCTION\nPrior  to  2002,  ASTM  Test  Method  F  1188  used  a  long  baseline  for  the  1107  cm\n\u22121\noxygen\nabsorption peak.  This long baseline was drawn between the average transmittances in the regions\nfrom 900 to 1000 cm\n\u22121\nand from 1200 to 1300 cm\n\u22121\n.  The same baseline was used in ASTM Test\nMethod  F  121,  the  predecessor  to  Test  Method  F  1188,  and  also  in  the  analysis  of  infrared  data\nfrom the Grand Round Robin (GRR) experiment.\n1\nThe GRR experiment resulted in a calibration\nfactor between the infrared absorption coefficient at 1107 cm\n\u22121\nand the absolute interstitial oxygen\ncontent known as \u201cIOC-88.\u201d  This calibration factor is utilized in the current editions of all known\nstandardized test methods for oxygen content of silicon, including DIN 50438, Part 1; and JEITA\nEM-3504; as well as the current Chinese National Standard (GB).\nThe long baseline method is being retained in the form published in the 1993a edition of this test\nmethod in Appendix 1.  However, the long baseline is subject to uncertainties due to perturbations\nin  the  IR  absorption  at  the  end-point  regions  arising  from  effects  other  than  absorption  by\ninterstitial  oxygen.    Use  of  a  shorter  baseline,  drawn  between  1040  and  1160  cm\n\u22121\n, which is less\naffected in this manner,\n2\nresults in improved precision of the method.  Use of the shorter baseline\nis  introduced  into  this  test  method  to  replace  the  long  baseline  method.    Although  the  use  of  this\nbaseline results in a somewhat smaller net absorption coefficient for the same oxygen content, this\nchange is not very large, and can be neglected in most cases.  Optionally, to completely eliminate\nthe  effect  of  the  baseline  changes,  the  measurement  equipment  may  be  calibrated  with  suitable\ncertified reference materials (CRMs) or reference materials derived from CRMs.\nNIST  SRM\n3\n2551  oxygen-in-silicon  reference  material,\n4,5\nwhich  is  the  principal  CRM  used  for\ncalibrating commercial infrared spectrophometers for oxygen measurements, was certified using a\nsubset of the GRR specimens as the absolute references.  Both the GRR specimens and the SRM\nspecimens  were  measured  using  a  short  baseline  similar  to  that  now  incorporated  in  this  test\nmethod.  This resulted in (1) reduced measurement uncertainty for the SRM specimens, and (2) a\nstrong  metrological  foundation  provided  by  the  GRR  specimens.    Consequently,  the  IOC-88\nresults are available to the users of the SRMs without requiring a change in the calibration factor\neven though the short-baseline method is used."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"1  Baghdadi, A., Bullis, W.

This  is  particularly  important  for  dispersive\nspectrophotometers, since in many such instruments the illuminated area of the specimen varies during the scan.  For\nspecimens  with  a  large  lateral  inhomogeneity,  this  area  variation  may  result  in  the  appearance  of  undesirable\ninstrumental artifacts in the spectra.\n10. 1.1  Prepare a slice of the crystal to be tested so as to obtain two optically flat surfaces parallel to 5 min of arc or\nless, as measured with a micrometer caliper or other suitable instrument.

The contrast of\nthe  interference  fringes  depends  upon  the  parallelism  of  the  specimen  surfaces,  and  the  fringe  spacing  depends  on  the  optical\nthickness of the specimen.  These fringes can obscure a weak spectral line and prevent accurate measurement of the baseline.

However,  the  use  of\nspecimens  with  nonparallel  surfaces  can  also  result  in  photometric  errors.    Because  silicon  has  a  high  refractive  index,  any\nnonparallelism of the specimen can displace the spectrometer beam relative to the active area of the detector.  Thus, an apparent\nlowering  of  the  transmission  occurs.    Improper  positioning  or  nonparallelism  of  the  specimen  can  be  checked  by  rotating  the\nspecimen to determine whether the transmission level stays constant.

The  manufacturer's\ninstrument  instruction  manuals  should  be  studied  to\nfamiliarize  the  operator  with  the  proper  use  of  the\nspectrometer.    Since  the  transmittance  at  the  carbon\npeak  can  be  very  low,  while  the  transmittance  at  the\nbaseline    regions    is    about    40%,    extremely    good\nphotometric linearity is critical.  Wavenumber precision\nis  also  critical  because  the  carbon  peak  lies  on  the\nshoulder of a very intense lattice absorption band.\n3. 4 The FWHM of the carbon absorption band at room\ntemperature  must  be  less  than  6  cm\n\u22121\nfor  acceptable\nmeasurements.

Excessive   width   may   be   due   to\nimproper  thickness  matching,  to  stress,  or  to  the  use  of\na low resolution setting of the instrument.  In dispersive\ninstruments,   excessive   widths   can   also   result   from\nincorrect  instrument  balance  setting  or  too  fast  a  scan\nspeed.
