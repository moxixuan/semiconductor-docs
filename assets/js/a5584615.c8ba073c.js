For example, a consumer interested in tracking the utilization of the equipment may\nonly  be  interested  in  specific  events  that  mark  actions  the  equipment  takes  that  indicate  how  it  is  being  exercised,\ncertain exceptions that may interrupt the equipment, and no trace data.  Such a data collection plan might be in effect\nat all times the equipment is running.\n8. 5.2  A fault detection consumer may be interested in trace, event, and exception data for a specific processing run,\nand may change the collected data depending on the recipe used.  Such data collection plans may only be in effect\nwhile specific jobs are in process on the equipment.  Coordination of data collection plan activation with job activity\non the equipment is the consumers\u2019 responsibility, and is not specified in this document.\n8. 5.3  This document specifies a mechanism for consumers to define one or more data collection plans off-tool and\nsubmit those definitions to the equipment (see Sections 9.1.2.2 and 11).  This document specifies a mechanism for\ndetermining  what  plans  have  been  created  on  the  equipment,  how  they  are  defined,  and  whether  or  not  they  are\nactivated  (see  Sections  9.1.2.3,  9.1.2.4,  and  9.1.2.6).    A  mechanism  for  activating,  deactivating,  and  deleting\nindividual  plans  is  also  specified  (see  Sections  9.1.2.5,  9.1.2.7,  and  9.1.2.8).    The  required  behavior  of  data\ncollection plans is specified in Section 12.\n8. 6  Equipment Operational Performance Monitoring\n8. 6.1  It  is  possible  for  consumers  to  submit  data  collection  requests  which,  when  executing  together,  significantly\ntax  the  equipment\u2019s  computing  resources,  in  addition  to  any  load  placed  on  the  equipment  by  jobs  that  are  in\nprogress.  This document specifies a mechanism for notifying all DCP consumers when such a condition has been\ndetected,  to  identify  what  DCPs  and  jobs  are  in  progress  at  the  time,  and  to  identify  the  specific  equipment\ncomponents that are being adversely affected (see Sections 9.1.2.11, 13, 15.1.5, and 15.1.6).\n8. 7  Ad-hoc Data Requests\n8. 7.1  Ad-hoc data requests are used in cases where the value of some data items is needed at a specific instance in\ntime,  and  which  may  not  be  associated  with  a  specific  event  or  exception.    As  a  simple  example,  consider  an\napplication  that  monitors  equipment  utilization.    Such  an  application  may  have  an  initialization  procedure  that\nincludes  determining  the  current  state  of  each  monitored  component  on  the  equipment.    Without  a  mechanism  for\nrequesting this information at initialization, the application would instead have to wait for state change events from\neach  component  before  it  could  determine  their  state.

The  equipment  is  not  required  to  take  any  other  actions  to  notify  consumers  of  such\nfailures.\n12. 2.2.1  Consumers  should  be  aware  that  such  failures  may  temporarily  prevent  the  equipment  from  reporting\nrequested events or exceptions altogether, and/or result in reporting \u201cNoValue\u201d (see Section 14.2.1.4) for requested\nparameters  affected  by  the  failure.    In  the  event  that  the  equipment  recovers  from  such  failures  and  any  affected\nDCPs are still active, the equipment shall resume reporting all event, exception, and trace data whose reporting had\nbeen affected by the failure.\n12. 2.3  DCPBuffering \u2014 This is the top level state for describing the event, exception, and trace buffering behavior\nof the DCP\n12. 2.4  NotBuffering  \u2014  The  DCP  is  immediately  sending  DataCollectionReports  for  each  requested  event  and\nexception as they are detected.  TraceReports may be individually buffered, according to the \u2018groupSize\u2019 setting of\nthe  DCP\u2019s  TraceRequests  (see  Section  11.1.5),  but  are  also  sent  in  the  DataCollectionReport  format  (see  Section\n14. 1 ).  This state is only active if the DataCollectionPlan attribute \u2018intervalInMinutes\u2019 attribute is set to 0.\n12. 2.5  Buffering  \u2014  The  DCP  is  storing  all  events,  exceptions,  and  trace  data  in  an  internal  buffer  in  the  order  in\nwhich   they   occur.      Buffered   data   is   sent   in   a   single   DataCollectionReport   (see   Section   14.1)   when\n\u2018intervalInMinutes\u2019  expires,  or  when  the  equipment\u2019s  DCP  buffering  capacity  has  been  reached,  whichever  occurs\nfirst.    The  equipment  continues  buffering  new  data  for  the  next  interval,  sending  a  single  DataCollectionReport\nwhen \u2018intervalInMinutes\u2019 expires.  Each DataCollectionReport sent at the end of each interval contains only the data\ncollected  during  that  interval.
