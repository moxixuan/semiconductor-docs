An array is an ordered collection of zero or more elements,each element of the same type. In this case the UML &#123;XOR&#125; constraint is used to show that arrays must containvalues of one type only (integers, reals, strings, etc.). Note also that array values can be nested (each element of anarray can be an array).14.4.3.1 ArrayValue  Represents an array of one or more values of the same type.14.4.3.2 ArrayValue Attribute Definition TableTable 75 ArrayValue Attribute DefinitionAttribute Name Definition Formvalues The values of the array.

ISO 8601 permits a variety ofpossible formats for the same time value, so it is necessary to establish a convention for the format used by timevalues in this document.14.5.2 For representing time values, this document restricts the string representation of time to the form CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.fff\[-+\]hh:mm. CC is the century (first century starts at 00), YY is the year, MM is themonth, and DD is the day, each represented as a two-digit number with leading zeroes as needed. For yearsbeyond 9999, additional digits can be added to the CC field. T separates date information from time information.hh is the hour, mm are the minutes, ss are the seconds, and fff are the sub-seconds, supporting up tomillisecond precision in local time. If equipment cant measure time with millisecond precision, it shall fill in thesub-second field with zeroes as appropriate up to the measurable precision (for example, if time can be measured

&lt;!-- Page 3 --&gt;

SEMI E134-0305 © SEMI 2004, 200561 RELATED INFORMATION 1DATA COLLECTION CONTEXT NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI Exxx and was derived from the work of theoriginating committee. This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures. R1-1 OverviewR1-1.1 This Related Information discusses some of the key requirements and expectations of the equipment forapplications that make use of Data Collection Management services for performing near-real-time analysis of timeseries (trace) data from equipment. The essential goal is for the equipment to provide sufficient, correct, and timelycontextual data to such applications in order to facilitate correct and timely analysis of trace data.R1-1.2 Typical Analysis Application Example Figure R1-1Typical Time-Series Data Analysis Example R1-1.2.2 Consumers that collect trace data from the equipment need to be able to quickly make sense of incomingdata in order to determine the proper analysis and/or limits to apply. In addition to the raw low level data valuesfrom sensors, actuators, and other devices of interest, applications need to be able to quickly determine the executingcontext associated with that data. The equipment needs to be able to provide sufficient context information to theapplication to allow it to determine at all times: What module is the data coming from? What recipe is that module running? What step is that recipe executing? What material is in that module? What job is responsible for that material?R1-1.2.3 In addition to the information in Section R1-1.2.2 , typical consumers must also know the manufacturingexecution context (for example, whether this an engineering lot, an experimental run, a characterization, a reworklot, a production run, a specific product, etc.) in order to properly analyze data from the equipment. While it is theconsumers responsibility to manage this manufacturing context data, it is the equipments responsibility to providethe context information described in Section R1-1.2.2 .R1-1.2.4 In many cases, this context data may consist of a non-trivial amount of descriptive information. It istypically not practical for all of this contextual data to be provided with each TraceReport sent by the equipment.Trace data may also be collected at rates up to, for example, 10Hz; much more frequently than the rate at which thejob-related context information changes. Because of this situation, it is normally sufficient for the equipment tocommunicate context changes when they happen by defining events that are generated whenever any of the contextdescribed in Section R1-1.2.2 changes (see Figure R1-1).

&lt;!-- Page 9 --&gt;

SEMI E134-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 62 R1-1.2.5 Along with such events, the equipment must also make available sufficient data with those events tocompletely describe the new context, as well as providing a way for consumers to query the current context at anytime in an ad-hoc fashion. Additionally, some subset of this context data can be made available for inclusion witheach TraceReport, such as the ids of the material at each location in the equipment.R1-1.2.6 Some of this context data can be provided directly through the SEMI Data Collection Management andrelated specifications. Specifically, the Data Collection Management specification requires that all parameters,events, and exceptions have both a source and a name. The source can be used to specify the physical equipmentcomponent that produces the parameter, event, or exception. This information can be made known to consumers,for example, through the use of SEMI E120 (Common Equipment Model) and E125 (Equipment Self Description).In this way, consumers are at all times aware of the physical equipment component from which the data, event, orexception is coming. Figure R1-2SEMI Standard Context Data R1-1.2.7 Additional context data can be obtained from the SEMI 300mm standards (SEMI E40, SEMI E94, andSEMI E90 data are shown as examples in Figure R1-2). However, at the time of this writing, some context data isnot available in standard form, yet is often essential for most analysis applications. For example, SEMI E40 doesnot provide a means for consumers to determine which sub-recipes might be executing on each module of theequipment, and does not provide a way for consumers to determine which recipe step is currently being executed oneach sub-recipe. This information is essential for fault detection applications, which need to analyze and applylimits to process data that may change depending on which recipe step is being executed on which component of theequipment. Unless and until this information becomes standardized, equipment suppliers will need to provide thisinformation to applications using proprietary events, exceptions and parameters.R1-1.2.8 Putting the standards data together with equipment-specific data to cover the gaps, we can see how aconsumer can take an incoming Data Collection Management TraceReport and determine much of the processingcontext. A typical example might involve the following high-level steps: Inspect the self-descriptive information available from the equipment via SEMI E125 to identify the low-levelsensor/actuator and process Parameters from each SEMI E120 equipment component that are of significance tothe purpose of the analysis application (diagnostic, fault detection, etc.)

&lt;!-- Page 10 --&gt;

SEMI E134-0305 © SEMI 2004, 200563  Create a DataCollectionPlan that includes at least one TraceRequest at the desired frequency. TheTraceRequest should include a ParameterRequest for each Parameter of interest from the previous step. Inspect the E125 data from the equipment to determine the SEMI standard carrier management, control job,process job, and substrate tracking events, exceptions, and available Parameters that provide key material andprocessing status context. In the DataCollectionPlan created earlier, include an EventRequest and ExceptionRequest for each contextevent and exception of interest. For each EventRequest, include a ParameterRequest for each context datavariable available for that event. Inspect the E125 data from the equipment to determine the supplier-defined events and data that communicatewhat sub-recipes and which steps are executing on which components of the equipment, and any other supplier-specific context data of significance to the purpose of the analysis application. In the DataCollectionPlan created earlier, include an EventRequest and ExceptionRequest for each contextevent and exception identified in the previous step. For each EventRequest, include a ParameterRequest foreach context data variable available for that event. Submit the DCP to the equipment using the DataCollectionManager DefinePlan operation, and activate usingthe ActivatePlan operation to begin receiving trace data and context events/exceptions.R1-1.2.9 Once such a DCP has been activated, consumers can begin tracking the location of each substrate on theequipment, so that their physical locations are always known. Since timestamps of all data are referenced to thetool, synchronization of the events and data can be correlated correctly.R1-1.2.10 Events from the equipment that inform what recipes are executing on which modules, and which step iscurrently executing can be tracked and stored by the consumer, so it is always known which module is executingwhich step in which recipe on which substrate.R1-1.2.11 By tracking Control and Process Job events and data, a consumer can always determine to which job agiven substrate at a given location belongs.R1-1.2.12 The consumer is responsible for managing the manufacturing context of each job, and so knows whichanalysis needs to be performed on data from material from those jobs.R1-1.2.13 Finally, because the consumer knows what the contents of the DCP are, it is also known which physicalequipment component produces each trace data variable. So, the data from a TraceReport can be correlated to aphysical equipment component, for which the consumer already knows the material located at that component, therecipe executing on the component, the step the recipe is executing, the job the material belongs to, and themanufacturing context for that job. Provided all of this information is provided correctly and in a timely fashion, aconsumer can always determine which analysis and/or control limits need to be applied to each TraceReport.

SEMI E134.1-0305 © SEMI 20055 1 Purpose1.1 SOAP Implementation Mapping1.1.1 The purpose of this specification is to provide an implementation mapping of the SEMI E134 specification forData Collection Management to the SOAP 1.1 protocol. This document provides a description of the XML Schemadata types used to support the UML classes defined in SEMI E134, and also describes the WSDL port type andbinding definitions used to support the operations defined by the interfaces specified in SEMI E134. 2 Scope2.1 Specification Scope2.1.1 The scope of this specification is the faithful representation of the DCM model in an XML Schema andcorresponding WSDL port types and bindings. It will not add new domain information or concepts to the SEMIE134 model. The only additions made are those needed to render useful WSDL or XML Schema.2.1.2 This specification requires SEMI E132 authentication, and defines requirements for the application of SEMIE132 concepts to the SEMI E134 specification.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Provisional Specification3.1.1 This specification is provisional pending the approval of the SEMI specifications Common Components(SEMI E138), SEMI E120.1, SEMI E125.1, and SEMI E132.1. This specification relies on XML Schema typesdefined by these specifications, and cannot be fully implemented without these types. Finalization of thesespecifications is a condition for the removal of the provisional status of this document.3.1.2 This specification is provisional pending approval of the SEMI specification for Units for the SemiconductorIndustry. This specification relies on the unit of measure symbols defined in that specification. Finalization of thisspecification is a condition for the removal of the provisional status of this document. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E121  Guide for Style & Usage of XML for Semiconductor Manufacturing ApplicationsSEMI E120.1  XML Schema for the Common Equipment ModelSEMI E132.1  Specification for SOAP Implementation of Equipment Client Authentication and AuthorizationSEMI E125.1  Specification for SOAP Implementation of Equipment Self DescriptionSEMI E138  XML Semiconductor Common ComponentsSEMI Specification for the Representation of Measurement Units in XML4.2 OMG Standards1 Unified Modeling Language (UML) Specification, Version 1.4, OMG Specification 01-09-67,(http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/modeling\_spec\_catalog.htm).4.3 W3C Standards2 1 Object Management Group, Inc., 250 First Ave. Suite 100, Needham, MA 02494, U.S.A., Phone: 781.444.0404, Fax:781.444.0320, website:www.omg.org.2 World Wide Web Consortium, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory(CSAIL), 32 Vassar Street Room 32-G515, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA, Telephone: 617.253.2613, Fax: 617.258.5999, website: www.w3.org.

XML is an extension of SGML, a document-oriented markuplanguage. It was created by W3C for use on the Internet. 6 Conventions6.1 Translating UML to XML Schema6.1.1 The reader is expected to have a working knowledge of the UML, XML, and Schema specifications (See0and 4.3). This document does not provide tutorial information on these subjects.6.1.2 This document follows the guidelines for XML as outlined in SEMI E121.6.1.3 Some of the key guidelines followed in this document are summarized here: Attributes of UML classes from SEMI E125 are generally represented as XML attributes, to improve efficiencyin transferring metadata descriptions from the equipment. Exceptions to this convention are UML attributesthat correspond to data structures or other constructs that cannot be represented as XML attributes, or mayinclude text values that may need to include non-parsed character data (CDATA). Composition associations are mapped to a single XML element (or multiple such elements if the specifiedmultiplicity is greater than 1).

&lt;!-- Page 20 --&gt;

SEMI E134.1-0305 © SEMI 20057  Aggregations are modeled as contained elements or arrays of references to one or more unique attributes of thetarget type. Inheritance is mapped to using complexType extension. In cases where a reference to an abstract base classoccurs in the UML model, a choice compositor for each of the possible derived types is used in order to restrictinstance documents from including arbitrary extension through type substitution.6.1.4 The translation of a UML class to XML Schema types is documented using a table format illustrated by Table1. Operations defined for a UML class are translated into WSDL operations.6.1.5 Translation Table Column Header Description Attribute or Role Name  If an attribute, the name of the attribute is placed here. If an association (includingaggregation or composition), the role name from the UML diagram is placed here. Compositions are often notassigned role names. In that case none is placed here. UML Name/Type  If an attribute, the data type of the UML attribute is place here. If an association, the typeof association is placed here. The possible association types are Composition, Aggregation, or the basicAssociation. UML defines these three types of association. XML Element or Attribute  Lists the type of XML construct used to represent the UML attribute orassociation. XML Name/Type  Provides the name and data type of the resulting XML construct. The type may be a built-in type (for example, xs:string), or a named type defined within the XML Schema.Table 1 Example Translation Table Attribute or Role Name UML Name/Type XML Element or Attribute XML Name/Typefriend association element Friend: HumanReferenceArrayemployees aggregation element Employees: HumanArrayfamily composition element Family: HumanArrayname string element Name: xs:string 6.1.6 Translating Operations to XML Schema6.1.6.1 The translation of an operation defined for UML interface classes to XML Schema types is documentedusing a table format illustrated in Table 2. One row is provided for each possible input/output argument for theoperation being described.Table 2 Example Translation Table for Operation Input/Output Arguments Argument Name Format XML Element or Attribute XML Name/Type 6.2 Documenting XML Schema and WSDL Files6.2.1 Associated with this document are XML Schema and WSDL files that are Common Components of thespecification.

SEMI E134.1-0305 © SEMI 2005 8 6.3 Documenting XML Schema With Diagrams6.3.1 This document provides graphical representations of the included XML Schema data type and elementdefinitions. Although no standard graphical notation for XML Schema could be found, various XML tools havetheir own notation. This document will use the notation provided by XMLSpy from Altova Corporation Table 1shows a sample XML Schema diagram that will be used to provide a basis for explanation of the schema graphicalnotation used in the rest of the document.6.3.2 In the diagram, rectangular boxes represent XML element definitions. Ownership or containment is read fromleft to right in the diagrams. In the sample diagram, ParentType contains Child1, Child2, Child 3, and Child 4. Inturn, Child2 contains Child2a, Child2b, and Child2c. The additional symbols (8-sided boxes) represent sequences orchoices. See Table 4 for an explanation of these symbols.Table 4 Altova XMLSPY Schema Diagram SymbolsDenotes a required ordered sequence of the right hand elements with a cardinality of onefor each element. (sequence)Denotes an optional ordered sequence of the right hand elements with a cardinality ofone for each element. (sequence)Denotes a required, but unordered, sequence of the right hand elements with acardinality of one for each element. (all)Denotes a required choice of the right hand elements. Exactly one or two of the righthand elements must be present. (choice) Denotes an element that contains parsed character dataDenotes a reference to a group or element defined elsewhere 6.3.3 A graphic using a solid line is a required element; using a dashed line represents an optional element. Numbersor ranges in the lower right hand corner represent cardinality. The default cardinality is one.6.3.4 To simplify a diagram or help focus on a particular aspect, detail may be hidden. The 8-sided symbols have asmall square on the right end. If a minus sign - is in the box, then all detail is shown. If the box contains a plussign +, then all detail to the right of that symbol is hidden. The example has no hidden detail.6.3.5 The yellow (or grey if printed in monochrome) boxes indicate the use of other defined types. So, Child4 is oftype Child4Type. Child4Type defines Child4a and Child4b. This detail may be hidden in the diagram. Objectoriented inheritance is typically represented in XML as type extension. In Figure 1, ParentType extendsChild1and2Type by adding a sequence that includes Child3 and Child4.6.3.6 Reading Figure 1 would yield the following additional information:1. Child1and2Type is an ordered sequence of two items: Child2 and Child1.2. Child1 contains an optional ordered sequence of Child1a, one or more Child1b, and (optionally) Child1c.3. Child2 contains a choice of one or two of the following: Child2a, Child2b, and Child2c.4. Child3 contains an unordered sequence of Child3a and Child3b.

WSDLportType definitions are named after the interface and its operations as they appear in SEMI E134. WSDL bindingdefinitions for each portType are used to specify the SOAP 1.1 envelope contents for each operation, and to definethe corresponding XML encoding styles and HTTP header usage. All SEMI E134 WSDL interfaces usedocument/literal encoding, with the complete SOAP header and body contents defined in XML Schema file(s) viaglobal element definitions.7.1.2 Figure 3 shows the relationship between the WSDL binding and portType definitions and the XML Schematypes used for each interface. The portType definition imports XML Schema type definitions used in each operationvia the XML Schema import statement. The WSDL binding definition imports the portType definition via theWSDL import statement. Figure 4 shows the specific XML Schema and WSDL files defined for SEMI E134.

SEMI E134.1-0305 © SEMI 2005 12 7.2 DataCollectionManager7.2.1 Application of SEMI E132 Sessions7.2.1.1 This section is provisional, pending the approval of SEMI E132.1 and the SEMI Specification forSemiconductor Common Components.7.2.1.2 The DataCollectionManager shall use SEMI E132.1 for authentication and authorization.7.2.1.3 Use of the interfaces defined in SEMI E134 to collect data can directly affect overall data throughput for theequipment, and may indirectly affect the equipments ability to perform its intended function. Additionally, dataaccessible from the equipment via the SEMI E134 interfaces may be proprietary to the equipment supplier and/orthe factory that uses the equipment, and should be protected against unauthorized access within the factory.7.2.1.4 For this reason, all operations defined by the SEMI E134 DataCollectionManager interface can beexchanged using the HTTPS transport (HTTP 1.1 over SSL 3.0) by enabling SSL authentication as specified inSEMI E132.1. Once enabled via SEMI E132.1, the equipment shall require mutual client-server SSL authenticationfor all SEMI E134 DataCollectionManager operations supported by the equipment, and the equipment shall notprovide access to any operations except via the HTTPS transport.7.2.2 There may be some integration, development, and/or test environments in which it is not practical or feasibleto install equipment and/or client certificates in order to communicate with the equipment. As a practicalconsideration for such environments only, the equipment shall support the ability of the user to disable SSLauthentication for the SEMI E134 DataCollectionManager interface, using the equipment configuration specified byE132.1. Users should be aware that disabling SSL authentication opens up complete unrestricted access to SEMIE134 data for any application with network access to the equipment.7.2.2.1 Regardless of whether or not SSL authentication is enabled, the equipment shall reject all requests fromclients that do not provide a valid SEMI E132 session identifier in the SOAP envelope header provided with therequest. The SEMI E132 session identifier shall be provided via the E132Header element, as specified by SEMIE132.1. If a client does not provide a recognized session identifier, the equipment shall immediately reject therequest using the SEMI Common Error data type, with an error code of 6005 and a source of urn:semi-org:E132as specified in SEMI E132.1. The equipment shall perform no other processing of an SEMI E134 request if therequest is found to include an invalid SEMI E132 session identifier, or if no session identifier is provided.7.2.3 Session and DCP State Interaction7.2.3.1 The equipment shall maintain DCP activity on a per-Session basis. For example, the same SEMI E132Principal may establish one or more SEMI E132 Sessions on the equipment. If only one of those Sessions activatesa DCP, the equipment shall only enable the DCP for that specific session. If two separate SEMI E132 sessionsattempt to activate the same DCP, the equipment shall activate the DCP for both sessions. Similarly if one activeSEMI E132 session attempts to activate the same DCP twice, the equipment shall respond to the second request withthe DCPIsActive error, as defined in SEMI E134.7.2.3.2 As described in 7.2.1.3 , the equipment shall use the URL provided with the HTTPEndpoint informationprovided with the SEMI E132 EstablishSession request to send all SEMI E134 communication.7.2.3.3 If a consumers SEMI E132.1 Session is closed for any reason (either expressly closed or through acommunication failure), the equipment shall stop sending data from all DCPs previously activated by thatconsumer. This shall not affect data transmission from those DCPs to consumers that still have SEMI E132Sessions in the Established state.7.2.3.3.1 If one or more of these DCPs has more than one consumer, the equipment shall take the actions defined intransition 5 of the E134 DataCollectionPlan State model. These DCPs will remain active, and the equipment shallremove the consumers session from the active consumers list and continue to send data to the other consumers forthose DCPs.7.2.3.3.2 If one or more of these DCPs has only one consumer, the equipment shall take the actions defined intransition 8 of the SEMI E134 DataCollectionPlan State model. The equipment shall remove the consumers sessionfrom the active consumers list and change the state of these DCPs to Inactive.

The WSDL portType itself is named after theSEMI E134 interface, and each WSDL portType operation is named after the corresponding UML operation definedfor the interface. Each WSDL operation consists of two WSDL message definitions corresponding to the input andoutput (request and response) for the UML operation defined in SEMI E134. Figure 5 illustrates the relationshipbetween the SEMI E134 UML interface and the WSDL portType definition. The WSDL message and operationdefinitions are described in 7.2.10 through 7.2.20. Figure 5Mapping the DataCollectionManager to a WSDL portType 7.2.9 WSDL Binding Overview7.2.9.1 The WSDL DataCollectionManager binding definition specifies a message and transport protocol to use fora given portType (SOAP and HTTP for SEMI E134.1), the interface style used (document style for SEMI E134.1).For each WSDL portType operation, the binding defines any SOAP headers used and whether or not they arerequired, the HTTP SOAPAction header value to use for that operation, and the XML encoding to use (literal). Thebinding definitions for each portType operation are described in 7.2.10 through 7.2.20.7.2.10 WSDL Service Overview7.2.10.1 This specification does not provide a WSDL service definition. WSDL service definitions define theaddress(es) at which a given interface can be accessed by a client. Such information cannot be determined until theequipment has been installed on a factory network, and therefore is out of scope for this specification. Users areresponsible for defining the mechanisms by which clients locate SEMI E134 equipment services in the factory
