SPECIFICATIONS FOR ETCHANTS
1  Preface</p><ol><li>1    The   SEMI   Committee   on   Chem ical   Reagents
began   its   efforts   on   etchants   in   1979.   With   this
publication,  the  Committee  establishes  definitions  for
three   major   types   of   etchant   mixtures;   mixed   acid
etchants,    buffer    oxide    etchants,    and    phosphoric
etchants.  Specifications  and  analytical  procedures  are
introduced for each type.</li><li>2   Etchants  within  all  of  the  requ irements  can  be
described as “meeting SEMI specifications.”</li><li>3   Where  an  analytical  procedure   different  from  that
provided is substituted by a supplier or user, the burden
of  proof  is  on  said  supplier  or  user  to  confirm  the
equivalency.
2  Definitions</li><li>1  All definitions set forth in SEM I C1, Section 2 are
adopted for SEMI C2.</li><li>2   Etchant  —  The  exact  definitio n  of  an  etchant
mixture  shall  be  set  forth  as  the  initial  paragraph  of  its
Standard. The composition shall be expressed as a ratio
of  the  relative  volumes  taken  of  the  components  in  an
assigned   order.   In   the   expression,   all   the   relative
volumes  shall  be  reduced  to  a  ratio  of  the  smallest
whole  numbers.  If  a  component  is  absent,  its  relative
volume shall be taken as zero.</li><li>3  Composition — The content o f each component of
an  etchant  shall  be  expressed  on  a  weight/weight  basis
of  the  100%  component  (for  example,  100%  HF,  not
49%  HF).  Any  tolerance  allowed  for  the  content  of  a
component shall be expressed on a weight/weight basis
of that 100% component.
3  General Procedures and G uidelines to
Certain Methods</li><li>1   The  general  procedures  and  gu idelines  for  certain
methods  set  forth  in  SEMI  C1,  Section  3  are  adopted
for SEMI C2.</li><li>2    Determination   of   Nitric   Acid   b y   Ultraviolet
Absorption Spectrophotometry</li><li>2.1   Introduction  —  The  photomet ric  determination
of nitric acid in various etchant mixtures is based on the
strong  absorption  of  the  nitrate  ion  in  the  ultraviolet
region.  For  this  spectral  region  fused  silica  (quartz)
cells are required.</li><li>2.2   Preparation  of  Calibration  Cu rve  —  Secure  a
bottle  of  nitric  acid  (70%)  and  determine  its  assay  in
duplicate. Accurately weigh 2.8 to 3.0 g dilute with 100
mL of water, add 10 drops of phenolphthalein indicator
solution to each solution, and titrate with standardized 1
N sodium hydroxide solution to a pink end-point.

accurately  weigh  about  1.0,  1.2,  1.4,  1.6  and  1.8  g  of
the  previously  assayed  70%  nitric  acid.  Calculate  the
weight, in grams, of 100% nitric acid present in each of
these   five   standards.   Quantitatively   transfer   each
standard  to  a  separate  100  mL  volumetric  flask,  dilute
to volume with water, and mix thoroughly.</li><li>2.4  Following the manufacturer’s  directions, ready a
spectrophotometer  and  set  the  wavelength  to  302  nm.
Measure  the  absorbance  of  each  standard  versus  water
using  a  1  cm  fused  silica  cell.  On  (linear)  coordinate
graph  paper  plot  the  absorbance  versus  the  weight,  in
grams, of 100% nitric acid for each standard. Draw the
best-fitting straight line through the points.</li><li>2.5  Application to Acid Etch Mixtu res — Proceed as

GUIDE FOR DETERMINATION OF METHOD DETECTION LIMITS
This  guide  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Liquid  Chemicals  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Liquid  Chemicals  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American Regional Standards Committee on November 4, 2004.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> January
2005; to be published March 2005. Originally published in 1998; previously published February 1999.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  To  provide  a  minimal  set  of  guidelines  for  the  quantitative  determination  of  a  method  detection  limit  (MDL)
from data supporting a SEMI Process Chemicals or Gases specification.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This  guide  applies  to  trace  contaminants  specified  in  SEMI  Process  Chemicals  or  Gases  standards  and
guidelines.    All  relevant  trace  contaminants  should  have  an  MDL  determined  from  a  regression  analysis  of  a
calibration curve that is equal to, or less than, their specifications.  This guide is intended for use in both establishing
new specifications within SEMI as well as verification of performance to SEMI specifications.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.

None.
5  Boundary Conditions
NOTE 1:  A series of boundary conditions is required of the data from which the MDL is to be determined from.
5. 1  Data should be collected on at least two standards at different concentration levels, not including the blank.
5. 2  The concentration levels investigated must either span the relevant specification or include it as a level. For this
purpose,  the  calibration  range  can  be  adjusted  for  instrument  sensitivity  by  pre-concentration  or  dilution,  if
applicable.
5. 3  A  minimum  of  three  independent  sample  determinations  should  be  taken  on  each  concentration  level  of  the
standard investigated.
5. 4  Matrix Effects
5. 4.1  The blank and the standards should be matrix-matched with the sample when testing a specification and run
under the same conditions, both during calibration and sample analysis.
5. 4.2  If external standards in a different matrix are used for calibration, the user must compensate for matrix effects
using suitable internal standards.</p><p>1 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 605 Third Avenue New York, NY 10158-0012, 212.850.6000</p><p>SEMI C10-0305 © SEMI 1998, 2005 2
5. 5  Where applicable, this guide supersedes the earlier related SEMI Guide: SEMI C16.
5. 6  The frequency of the MDL determination should be part of the quality assurance program for the laboratory.
6  Procedure
NOTE 2:  The determination of the MDL should be performed under the same conditions that samples will normally be run. All
appropriate precautions to avoid contamination should be followed.
6. 1  Reagents  and  Standards  —  Reagents  and  standards  used  should  be  of  the  same  high-purity  as  used  in  the
analysis  of  samples.  Accurate  standard  solutions  of  trace  contaminants  are  needed  for  the  preparation  of  the
calibration standards. Commercially available standard solutions are suitable. These solutions should be traceable to
NIST standards. Working standard solutions should be prepared on the day of use by dilution of the stock standard
solution. Standards and blanks should be matrix-matched to the sample to be analyzed.
6. 2  Operating Conditions
6. 2.1  Instrumental  —  Principles  of  instrumental  analysis  are  provided  within  many  monographs.  No  general
operating  conditions  are  given  here  since  these  will  vary  with  the  instrument  type  and  design;  consequently,  the
manufacturers manual should be followed.
6. 2.2  Standard  and  Sample  Preparation  —  With  certain  methods,  the  achievable  MDL  can  be  improved  by  pre-
concentration. Some methods require matrix dilution to run some analyses and may also affect the MDL.
6. 2.3  Calibration  —  Calibrate  the  instrument  for  all  specified  trace  contaminants  using  measurement  and
preparation  protocols  identical  to  those  used  in  sample  preparation  and  measurement,  wherever  appropriate.  The
calibration data structure used to determine the MDL should be as close to identical as possible to the data structure
normally  used  for  calibration  in  the  laboratory.  Minimum  data  requirements  should  be  determinations  at,  at  least,
two concentration levels (standards), each independently sampled 3 times. The lowest concentration standard should
be at, or below, the specification and give a measurable signal. The blank may be used in the calculation of the MDL
if its variability is judged to be representative of that of a very low-level standard. All instrument response data used
in  the  analysis  should  be  measurable.  The  calibration  range  can  be  adjusted  for  instrument  sensitivity  by  pre-
concentration or dilution to match with how the samples are analyzed. Use the data collected to calculate the MDL
using the formulas in the next section.
6. 3  Quantification of the MDL
6. 3.1  The  MDL  is  calculated  by  using  the  results  from  a  regression  analysis  of  the  calibration  data  to  obtain  a  3
sigma equivalent (in probability) upper confidence limit of individual measurements. Two alternative computational
methods  are  provided  for  linear  calibration  models.  One  provides  the  MDL  based  on  an  ordinary  least  squares
(OLS)  regression  analysis;  the  other  on  a  weighted  least  squares  (WLS)  based  regression  analysis.  These  two
computational  alternatives  do  not  provide  the  same  MDL.  The  OLS  algorithm  is  appropriate  when  signal
uncertainty  remains  relatively  constant  over  the  window  of  calibration;  otherwise,  the  WLS  algorithm  is  more
appropriate. A third alternative allows the use of similar regression-based approaches for MDL determination in the
presence of a more complex calibration model (e.g., nonlinear, multivariate), or when distributional assumptions of
the  other  alternatives  are  not  appropriate.  Many  software  packages  perform  regression  analysis,  and  their  use  is
recommended.
6. 3.2  Statistical Definitions
6. 3.2.1  Method  detection  limit  (MDL)  —  The  level  at  which  the  errors  in  the  measurement  method  become  large
enough such that the preset maximum acceptable risk of seeing the quantified level, when none of the contaminant
in question is present in the sample, is exceeded.
6. 3.2.2  risk — This guide uses 0.13% as the maximum acceptable risk. This is the probability of observing a given
result  from  a  normal  distribution  that  is  3  or  more  standard  deviations  above  the  average.  Risk  is  set  on  a  per-
contaminant basis.
6. 3.2.3
calibration curve — An estimate of the relationship between concentration and instrument response (signal
intensity).  A  line,  which  has  not  been  constrained  to  pass  through  the  origin,  is  implicitly  assumed  in  the
subsequently provided formulae.
6. 3.2.4  regression analysis — A curve-fitting technique from which the calibration curve can be estimated.</p><p>SEMI C10-0305 © SEMI 1998, 2005 3
6. 3.2.5  Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) — A curve-fitting criterion which, for a given calibration model, minimizes.

6. 3.2.7  t-statistic — Student’s t is used instead of the Z-statistic (normal distribution) when the standard deviation is
estimated from relatively small quantities of data. It is used herein to explicitly control the risk at 0.13%, regardless
of sample size.
• Xs — The concentrations of the standards used in quantifying the MDL.
• Ys — The instrument’s response (signal intensity) to each of the Xs in question.
6. 3.3  Calculations — OLS and Linear Calibration Model
6. 3.3.1  A line, which is not constrained to pass through the origin, is used as the calibration model. OLS is used to
estimate  the  model.  The  MDL  is  located  by  determining  the  3  sigma  equivalent  Upper  Confidence  Limit  at  X  =  0
and using a linear calibration model to convert this result into the corresponding concentration (MDL).</p><p>Figure 1

between two relatively large numbers; it is critical that all previous calculations not be based on rounded numbers.
In general, such analyses should be performed using a spreadsheet or computer program.</li><li>3.4.3  The  previous  equations  neither  require  nor  prevent  use  of  data  from  blank  quantification.  In  order  to  use
blank data in the MDL quantification with WLS, the blank should be measurable, be likely to give a response which
is  consistent  with  the  pattern  in  the  other  calibration  data,  and  provide  a  level  of  variability  consistent  with  the
pattern seen in the investigated standards.</li><li>3.5  Alternative  Calculations  — Situations  exist  for  which  both  prior  alternatives  (¶6.3.3  and  ¶6.3.4)  may  be
inappropriate. For example:
(a)   a calibration model may be nonlinear,
(b)   a calibration model may be multivariate in nature,
(c)   the  implicit  assumption  of  normality  of  residuals  (errors  in  predictions  about  the  calibration)  may  not  be  an
appropriate distributional assumption,
(d)   the lowest level standard used in calibration may be too far above the true MDL.</li><li>3.5.1  In  case  (a),  a  nonlinear  model  can  be  used  instead  of  the  default  linear  model  in  performing  a  regression
analysis  which  quantifies  the  Upper  Confidence  Limit  for  individuals  at  X  =  0  at  a  3  sigma  equivalent  probability
level  (and  back-projects  this  result  through  the  nonlinear  calibration  model  to  estimate  the  MDL).  How  to
accomplish this is the responsibility of those applying this alternative. In some situations, a transformation of scale
(X and/or Y) may linearize the model such that the previously provided calculations are again applicable.</li></ol><p>SEMI C10-0305 © SEMI 1998, 2005 8
6. 3.5.2  In case (b), a multivariate calibration model can be used instead of the default linear model in performing a
regression  analysis  which  quantifies  the  Upper  Confidence  Limit  for  individuals  at  X  =  0  at  a  3  sigma  equivalent
probability level (and back-projects this result through the multivariate calibration model using the observed point of
maximum interference in terms of the other concentrations in the range of calibration to estimate the MDL). How to
accomplish this is the responsibility of those applying this alternative.
6. 3.5.3  In  case  (c),  other  error  distributions  than  the  normal,  can  be  used  wherever  appropriate.  The  same
philosophical  approach  should  be  applied;  a  regression  analysis  which  quantifies  the  Upper  Confidence  Limit  for
individuals  at  X  =  0  at  a  3  sigma  equivalent  probability  level  (and  back-projects  this  result  through  the  calibration
model to estimate the MDL). How to accomplish this is the responsibility of those applying this alternative.
6. 3.5.4  In  case  (d),  it  is  more  likely  that  one  will  obtain  a  higher  MDL  than  is  truly  the  case.  This  phenomena  is
more likely to occur when the blank is not usable in the regression analysis for any reason. The only fix for this is to
reapply  the  procedure  with  a  set  of  standards  which  is  not  so  distant  from  the  MDL,  but  still  otherwise  meets  the
requirements provided herein.
6. 3.5.5  In cases (a), (b), and (c), or any combination thereof, the use of appropriate computer/statistical tools is the
responsibility  of  those  applying  these  alternatives.  Additional  information  on  regression  analysis  methods  can  be

7  Detection Limits
7. 1  If  a  detection  limit  is  reported,  the  specific  method  or  published  variant  by  which  the  detection  limit  was
obtained,  should  be  named.  The  level  of  the  lowest  standard  used  in  determination  of  a  detection  limit  should  be
reported.
8  Internal Standards
8. 1  For  procedures  calling  for  concentration  of  an  analyte  by  cryogenic  trapping,  acid  extraction,  distillation,
hydrolization, etc., a recovery study as per Method Validation (§3.14 of SEMI C1) is required. For a method to be
viable, a recovery in the range of 75–125% is recommended.
9  Calibration Models
9. 1  The span of the calibration data should include the relevant specification.
9. 2  The form of the calibration model (line through origin, line, etc.) should be stated. The assumption of linearity,
underlying  reliance  on  two  point  (zero  and  span)  calibrations  for  analytical  instruments,  should  be  justified  by
reporting the basis for such an assumption.
9. 3  A list of which standards were used to develop the calibration model should be provided.
9. 4  Information  on  which  fitting  technique  was  used  (i.e.,  regression  using  ordinary  least  squares,  weighted  least
squares, partial least squares) should be provided.
9. 5  Identify which, if any, transformations were applied to the calibration data prior to the fitting of the calibration
model.
9. 6  Identify which response was modeled to establish calibration (i.e., peak area, peak height, response factor).
9. 7  A  list  of  the  types  of  standards  employed  (i.e.,  internal  standards,  external  standards,  method  of  standard
addition) should be provided.
9. 8  Report  how  the  calibration  data  is  incorporated  in  producing  the  results  of  an  analysis  (i.e.,  zero  and  span
correction, graph).
10  Method Precision
10. 1  An estimate of method precision should be provided at the level of the specification. Any known interferants
or factors which may affect method precision should be stated.
11  Summary
11. 1  Since  only  a  minimal  set  of  guidelines  is  provided,  those  using  this  guide  are  encouraged  to  provide  more
detail or use more stringent guidelines than those suggested.</p><p>NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for any

8. 1  Assay — Place 15 mL (15.8 g)  of sample in a 20 ×
150  mm  test  tube  in  which  is  centered  an  accurate
thermometer.  The  sample  tube  is  centered  by  one  or
more stoppers in an outer tube about 38 × 20 mm. Cool
the   entire   apparatus,   without   stirring,   in   a   bath   of
shaved  or  crushed  ice  and  sufficient  water  to  immerse
the outer tube above the level of the acetic acid. When
the  thermometer  temperature  is  about  13°C   stir   to
induce  freezing  and  read  the  thermometer  every  half
minute.  The  temperature  that  remains  constant  for  1  to
2 minutes is the freezing point and should not be below
16°C, indicating not less than 99.7% as CH

COOH.
8. 2   Color  —   Dilute  2.0  mL  of  plat inum-cobalt  stock
solution  (APHA  No.  500)  to  100  mL  with  water.
Compare this standard (APHA No. 10) with 100 mL of
sample  in  Nessler  tubes.  View  vertically  over  a  white
background.  The  sample  must  be  no  darker  than  the
standard.
8. 3   Residue  after  Evaporation  —   E vaporate  95  mL
(100  g)  of  sample  in  a  tared  porcelain  or  silica  dish  to
dryness on a steam bath in a hood. Dry at 105°C for 30
minutes, cool in a desiccator, and weigh (see SEMI C1,
Section     3.3,     Determination     of     Residue     After
Evaporation).
8. 4   Solubility  in  Water  —   Mix  10  m L  of  sample  with
30  mL  of  water.  Allow  to  stand  1  hour.  The  solution
should be as clear as an equal volume of water.
8. 5   Chloride  —   Dilute  9.5  mL  (10   g)  of  sample  with
10  mL  of  water.  Add  1  mL  of  silver  nitrate  reagent

hood.  Dissolve  the  residue  in  0.5  mL  of  ammonium
hydroxide, dilute with 20 mL of water and add 1.5 mL
of  nitric  acid.  Any  turbidity  produced  should  be  no
greater  than  that  produced  when  0.01  mg  of  chloride
ion (Cl) is treated as the sample.</p><p>SEMI C18-0301 © SEMI 1978, 2001ACETIC ACID2
8. 6   Phosphate  —  Evaporate  9.5  m L  (10  g)  of  sample
to  dryness  on  a  steam  bath  in  a  hood.  Dissolve  the
residue,  warming  if  necessary,  in  25  mL  of  0.5  N
sulfuric  acid.  Add  1  mL  of  ammonium  molybdate
reagent  solution  and  1  mL  of  p-(methylamino)phenol
sulfate   reagent   solution.   Allow   to   stand   at   room
temperature  for  2  hours.  Any  blue  color  should  be  no
greater  than  that  produced  when  0.01  mg  of  phosphate
ion (PO
4
) is treated as the sample.
8. 7   Substances  Reducing  Dichrom ate  —   To  10  mL
(10.5  g)  of  sample,  add  1.0  mL  of  0.1  N  (0.017  M)
potassium  dichromate  solution  and  cautiously  add  10
mL   of   sulfuric   acid.   Cool   the   solution   to   room
temperature and allow to stand for 30 minutes. Add 50
mL  of  water  slowly  and  cautiously  with  continual
swirling,  allow  to  cool,  and  then  add  1  mL  of  freshly
prepared  potassium  iodide  reagent  solution.  Titrate  the
liberated iodine with 0.1 N (0.1 M) thiosulfate solution
using  starch  as  the  indicator.  Compare  the  volume  of
thiosulfate  solution  required  with  that  for  a  10  mL
water  blank  prepared  in  parallel  with  the  sample.  The
difference  between  the  titrations  for  sample  and  blank
should be no greater than 0.40 mL.
8. 8   Substances  Reducing  Permang anate  —   Dilute  40
mL  (42  g)  of  sample  with  10  mL  of  water.  Cool  to
15°C,  add  0.30  mL  of  0.1  N  (0.02  M)  potassium
permanganate,   and   allow   to   stand   at   15°C   for   10
minutes.   The   pink   color   should   not   be   entirely
discharged.
8. 9  Sulfate —  To 95 mL (100 g) o f sample, add 10 mL
of  sodium  carbonate  reagent  solution  and  evaporate  to
dryness  in  a  hood.  Dissolve  the  residue  in  10  mL  of
water  and  1  mL  of  dilute  hydrochloric  acid  (1  +  19);
filter if necessary. Add 1 mL of barium chloride reagent
solution,  mix  and  allow  to  stand  for  10  minutes.  Any
turbidity   developed   should   be   no   greater   than   that
produced  when  0.05  mg  of  sulfate  ion  (SO
4
)  is  treated
as the sample.
8. 10  Arsenic and Antimony (as As) —  To 190 mL (200
g)  of  sample  in  a  400  mL  beaker,  add  5  mL  of  nitric
acid  and  5  mL  of  sulfuric  acid  and  evaporate  to  dense
fumes of sulfur trioxide in a hood. Cool, cautiously add
10 mL of water, and again evaporate to dense fumes of
sulfur   trioxide.   Cool   and   cautiously   wash   into   a
generator flask with water to make a volume of 35 mL.
Proceed as described in the General Method for Arsenic
(and Antimony) under SEMI C1, Section 3.4.5, starting
with  the  sentence  which  begins:  “Swirl  the  flask....”
Any   red   color   in   the   silver   diethyldithiocarbamate
solution of the sample should be no greater than that of
the standard containing 0.001 mg of arsenic (As).
8. 11   Acetic  Anhydride  —   Place  52.2   g  (50  mL)  of
sample  in  a  250  mL  titration  flask.  In  a  second  flask
place  50  mL  of  glacial  acetic  acid  known  to  be  free
from  acetic  anhydride  (see  NOTE  3).  Into  each  flask
pipet    10    mL    of    1.0%    solution    of    4,    4&#x27;    -
methylenedianiline  (4,  4&#x27;  -diaminodiphenylmethane)  in
glacial  acetic  acid  (see  NOTE  4)  and  add  0.10  mL  of</p><ol><li>0%  solution  of  crystal  violet  in  glacial  acetic  acid.
Titrate each solution with a 0.1 N solution of perchloric
acid  in  glacial  acetic  acid  (see  NOTE  5)  to  a  green
endpoint.  Subtract  the  volume  for  the  titration  of  the
sample from the volume for the other titration. One mL
of   0.1   N   perchloric   acid   corresponds   to   0.0194%
(CH
3
CO)
2
O for a 50 mL sample.
NOTE 4: Glacial    acetic    acid    suspected    of    containing
anhydride  may  be  purified  by  adding  0.50  mL  of  water  per
100 mL and digesting overnight in a glass-stoppered flask on
the  steam  bath.  If  this  acid  is  used  for  comparison  in  the
above  test,  0.25  mL  of  water  should  be  added  to  the  flask
containing  the  test  sample  just  before  the  endpoint,  because
water affects the indicator change slightly.
NOTE 5: Dissolve   2.50   g   of   4,   4&#x27;   -methylenedianiline
(colorless  or  only  slightly  colored)  in  glacial  acetic  acid  to
make 250 mL. Protect the solution from light.
NOTE 6: Slowly add 4.5 mL of 70% perchloric acid to about
400  mL  of  glacial  acetic  acid  and  dilute  with  glacial  acetic
acid  to  500  mL.  Standardize  against  potassium  hydrogen
phthalate in glacial acetic acid solution using crystal violet as
indicator.</li><li>12   Trace  Metal  Analysis  —   The  f ollowing  method

NOTE 2: Neutralized formaldehyde solution: Dilute 20 mL of
37% formaldehyde solution with 20 mL of water, add 0.1 mL
of  phenolphthalein  indicator  solution,  and  titrate  with  0.1  N
sodium hydroxide to a slight pink color.</li><li>2  Color  —  Dilute  2.0  mL  of  platinum-cobalt  stock
solution  (APHA  No.  500)  to  100  mL  with  water.
Compare this standard (APHA No. 10) with 100 mL of
sample  in  Nessler  tubes.  View  vertically  over  a  white
background.  The  sample  must  be  no  darker  than  the
standard.</li><li>3  pH  of  a  1%  solution  —  Dilute  2.5  mL  (2.8  g)  of
sample  to  100  mL  with  carbon  dioxide-  and  ammonia-
free water. Using a pH meter determine the pH at 25°C
1  to  2  minutes  after  immersion  of  electrodes.  The  pH
range   6.0–7.5   corresponds   to   0.2%   free   hydrogen
fluoride  (HF)  to  0.2%  ammonium  hydroxide  (NH
4
OH)
in the original solution.</li><li>4  Chloride — Mix 2.2 mL (2.5 g) of sample with 20
mL  of  water  containing  0.5  g  of  boric  acid.  Add  1  mL
of nitric acid and 1 mL of silver nitrate reagent solution,
and   allow   to   stand   for   5   minutes.   Any   turbidity
produced should be no greater than that produced when</li><li>01 mg of chloride ion (Cl) is treated as the sample.</li><li>5  Nitrate  —  To  2  mL  of  water  in  a  white  plastic
beaker,  add  0.9  mL  (1  g)  of  sample,  1  mL  of  sulfuric
acid,   0.05   mL   of   0.01   N   (0.002   M)   potassium
permanganate,    mix,    and    decolorize    with    sodium</li></ol><p>SEMI C20-1101 © SEMI 1978, 2001AMMONIUM FLUORIDE 40%2
arsenite  reagent  solution.  Dilute  to  50  mL  with  brucine
sulfate reagent solution and mix. Heat the solution in a
preheated  (boiling  water)  bath  for  10  minutes.  Cool
rapidly in an ice bath to room temperature. The yellow
color  of  the  sample  should  be  no  greater  than  that
produced  when  0.01  mg  of  nitrate  ion  (NO
3
)  is  treated
as the sample.
8. 6  Phosphate  —  To  a  9  mL  (10  g)  sample  in  a
platinum  dish,  add  1  mL  of  sodium  carbonate  reagent
solution  and  40  mL  of  nitric  acid.  Evaporate  carefully,
to prevent spattering, to near dryness. Cool, wash down
the  sides  of  the  dish  with  5  mL  of  nitric  acid,  and
evaporate to dryness. Repeat the evaporation with nitric
acid  two  more  times  to  ensure  complete  removal  of  all
the  fluoride.  To  the  cooled  dish,  add  25  mL  of  0.5  N
sulfuric   acid   to   dissolve   the   residue,   warming   if
necessary.  Cool,  transfer  to  a  color  comparison  tube,
and  add  1  mL  of  ammonium  molybdate  reagent  solu-
tion,  1  mL  of  p-(methylamino)phenol  sulfate  reagent
solution,  and  allow  to  stand  at  room  temperature  for  2
hours.  Any  blue  color  should  be  no  greater  than  that
produced  when  0.01  mg  of  phosphate  ion  (PO
4
)  is
treated as the sample.
8. 7  Sulfate — To 23 mL (25 g) of sample, add 10 mL
of  sodium  carbonate  reagent  solution  and  heat  gently
until  sample  has  been  volatilized.  To  the  residue  add  5
mL  of  hydrochloric  acid  and  evaporate  to  dryness  in  a
hood. Dissolve the residue in 10 mL of water and 1 mL
of dilute hydrochloric acid (1 + 19); filter if necessary.
Add 1 mL of barium chloride reagent solution, mix, and
allow to stand for 10 minutes. Any turbidity developed
should  be  no  greater  than  that  produced  when  0.05  mg
of sulfate ion (SO
4
) solution is treated as the sample.
8. 8  Arsenic and Antimony (as As) — To 30 mL (33 g)
in a fluoroplastic beaker, add 20 mL of nitric acid and 5
mL of hydrochloric acid, and evaporate to dryness in a
sand   bath   in   a   hood.   Completely   volatilize   the
ammonium  fluoride,  but  do  not  bake.  Add  10  mL  of
water and 5 mL of sulfuric acid and evaporate to dense
fumes of sulfur trioxide. Cool, cautiously add 10 mL of
water,  and  again  evaporate  to  dense  fumes  of  sulfur
trioxide.  Cool,  and  cautiously  wash  into  a  generator
flask  with  water  to  make  a  volume  of  35  mL.  Proceed
as  described  in  the  General  Method  for  Arsenic  (and
Antimony) under SEMI C1, Section 3.4.5, starting with
the  sentence  that  begins,  “Swirl  the  flask....”  Any  red
color  in  the  silver  diethyldithiocarbamate  solution  of
the   sample   should   be   no   greater   than   that   of   the
standard containing 0.001 mg of arsenic (As).
8. 9  Trace Element Contents  —  By  a  suitable  emission
spectrographic  procedure,  determine  for  each  of  the
specified  trace  elements  that  its  content  is  not  greater
than   the   stated   specification   limit   (see   SEMI   C1,
Section 3.5, Guidelines for Emission Spectrography).

produced  when  0.01  mg  of  chloride  ion  (Cl)  is  treated
as the sample.
10. 4   Nitrate  —   To  2  mL  of  water  in   a  white  plastic
beaker,  add  0.9  mL  (1g)  of  sample,  1  mL  of  sulfuric
acid,   0.05   mL   of   0.01   N   (0.002   M)   potassium
permanganate,    mix,    and    decolorize    with    sodium
arsenite  reagent  solution.  Dilute  to  50  mL  with  brucine
sulfate reagent solution and mix. Heat the solution in a
preheated  (boiling  water)  bath  for  10  minutes.  Cool
rapidly in an ice bath to room temperature. The yellow
color  of  the  sample  should  be  no  greater  than  that
produced  when  0.01  mg  of  nitrate  ion  (NO

)  is  treated
as the sample.
10. 5   Phosphate  —  To  a  9  mL  (10  g )  sample  in  a
platinum  dish,  add  1  mL  of  sodium  carbonate  reagent
solution  and  40  mL  of  nitric  acid.  Evaporate  carefully,
to prevent spattering, to near dryness. Cool, wash down
the  sides  of  the  dish  with  5  mL  of  nitric  acid,  and
evaporate to dryness. Repeat the evaporation with nitric
acid  two  times  to  ensure  complete  removal  of  all  the
fluoride.  To  the  cooled  dish,  add  25  mL  of  0.5  N
sulfuric   acid   to   dissolve   the   residue,   warming   if
necessary.  Cool,  transfer  to  a  color  comparison  tube,
and   add   1   mL   of   ammonium   molybdate   reagent
solution,   1   mL   of   p-(methylamino)phenol   sulfate
reagent    solution,    and    allow    to    stand    at    room
temperature  for  2  hours.  Any  blue  color  should  be  no
greater  than  that  produced  when  0.01  mg  of  phosphate
ion (PO

) is treated as the sample.
10. 6  Sulfate —  To 23 mL (25 g) of  sample, add 10 mL
of  sodium  carbonate  reagent  solution  and  heat  gently
until sample has been volatilized. To the residue, add 5
mL  of  hydrochloric  acid  and  evaporate  to  dryness  in  a
hood. Dissolve the residue in 10 mL of water and 1 mL
of dilute hydrochloric acid (1 + 19); filter if necessary.
Add 1 mL of barium chloride reagent solution, mix, and
allow to stand for 10 minutes. Any turbidity developed
should  be  no  greater  than  that  produced  when  0.05  mg
of sulfate ion (SO

with water addition. Do not allow to go to dryness. Add
5  mL  of  nitric  of  sulfur  trioxide.  Cool,  cautiously  add
10 mL of water, and again evaporate to dense fumes of
sulfur   trioxide.   Cool,   and   cautiously   wash   into   a
generator flask with water to make a volume of 35 mL.
Proceed as described in the General Method for Arsenic
(and Antimony) under SEMI C1, Section 3.4.5, starting
with  the  sentence  which  begins:  &quot;Swirl  the  flask....&quot;
Any   red   color   in   the   silver   diethyldithiocarbamate
solution of the sample should be no greater than that of
the standard containing 0.002 mg of arsenic (As).
8. 10   Trace  Metal  Analysis  —  The  f ollowing  method
has given satisfactory results in determining trace metal
impurities   at   the   value   specified   for   each   of   the
following   trace   metals:   aluminum   (Al),   boron   (B),
calcium  (Ca),  chromium  (Cr),  copper  (Cu),  gold  (Au),
iron   (Fe),   lead   (Pb),   magnesium   (Mg),   manganese
(Mn), nickel (Ni), potassium (K), sodium (Na), tin (Sn),
titanium (Ti), and zinc (Zn). Alternate methods may be
used   as   long   as   appropriate   studies   demonstrate
recovery  between  75  -  125%  of  a  known  sample  spike
for half of the value of each specified item.
8. 10.1  Special Reagents
8. 10.1.1  Mixed Acid  —  Mix  one  volum e  of  ultra  pure
70%  nitric  acid  with  four  volumes  of  ultra  pure  37%
hydrochloric acid.
8. 10.1.2  Standards — Composite stand ards containing
0. 5  ppm  of  each  element  in  10%  v/v  mixed  acid
solution are stable for at least 60 days.
8. 10.2  Sample Preparation — Place 2 .5 mL of mixed
acid into a clean 400 mL PTFE beaker. Weigh in 200 g
of  sample.  Put  a  PTFE-coated  stir  bar  in  the  solution
and  put  the  beaker  in  a  hood.  Evaporate  the  sample
under  a  current  of  air,  meeting  class  100  cleanroom
specifications,   with   stirring   to   ensure   continuous
contact of the acid and sample. Do not heat the sample
to   minimize   the   loss   of   volatile   organo-metallics.
Continue  to  evaporate  until  near  dryness.  Add  2.5  mL
of  mixed  acid,  mix  carefully,  and  transfer  the  solution
to  a  25  mL  volumetric  flask.  Rinse  the  beaker  and
dilute to volume with water.
8. 10.3  Analysis
8. 10.3.1    Analyze   the   sample   by   plasma    emission
spectrometry  except  sodium  and  potassium  by  atomic
absorption   or   flame   emission   within   24   hours   of
dilution using matrix matched standards. Run a reagent
blank and correct the data as necessary.
NOTE  2:    The  trace  metal  analysis  procedure  is  provisional,
pending  second  source  verification  of  recovery  data.  To  be
completed.

8. 6   UV  Absorbance  —  A  UV  scan   is  obtained  on  all
HMDS  electronic  grade  material  to  determine  if  any
UV   absorbing   impurities   are   present:   specifically
toluene.
8. 6.1   Equipment  —  Bausch  and  Lom b  Spectronic
2000    Spectrophotometer    or    other    double    beam
instrument capable of measurements at 270 nm. Cells -
1 cm path length.
8. 6.2   Reagents  —  FC-113  and  meth anol  for  UV  cell
cleaning.
8. 6.3   Procedure  —  Using  water  as  t he  reference  and
sample  cells,  establish  the  baseline  between  300  and
270  nm.  Remove  the  water  sample  from  the  sample
path  and  replace  it  with  the  HMDS  sample.  Read  the
absorbance  between  300  and  270  nm.  The  absorbance
at 270 nm should read 0.07 to 0.25.
NOTE 1: Oxygen will contribute to the UV absorbance.
NOTE 2: The sample must be at ambient temperature.
NOTE  3:  The  UV  absorbance  will  increase  or  decrease  with
time.
NOTE 4: HMDS is flammable and corrosive.
8. 7   Chloride  —  To  a  500  mL  sepa ratory  funnel,  add
260  mL  (200  g)  of  sample,  20  mL  of  water,  and  1  mL
of  sodium  hydroxide  reagent  solution.  Shake  well  for
30   seconds   and   allow   the   two   layers   to   separate.
Carefully draw off the aqueous (lower) layer into a 250
mL   beaker.   Repeat   the   extraction   five   times   and
combine  the  six  aqueous  extracts.  Add  2  mL  of  nitric
acid  to  acidify  the  solution  and  arrange  the  beaker  for
magnetic stirring.
8. 7.1   Using  a  pH  meter  fitted  with  a   silver  billet
electrode   (Beckman   #89261,   Corning   #476065,   or
equivalent)    and    a    silver/silver    chloride    reference
electrode,   determine   the   apparent   pH   versus   mL
readings while titrating the continuously stirred sample
solution with 0.01 M methanolic silver nitrate solution.
Add the silver nitrate solution in 0.1-0.2 mL increments
from a 10 mL buret. Run a total blank. Plot the titration
data on linear graph paper or use the second-derivative
method to establish the endpoint.

8. 7.2  Standard Silver Nitrate in Met hanol Solution —
Dissolve   1.700   grams   of   silver   nitrate   in   absolute
methanol  and  dilute  to  1000  mL.  Store  this  solution  in
an amber bottle and standardize immediately before use
against  a  standard  sodium  chloride  (NaCl)  solution
using the above second-derivative method.
8. 8   Heavy  Metals  (as  Pb)  —  Evap orate  130  mL  (100
g) of sample to dryness in a hood. Dissolve the residue
in  3  mL  of  dilute  hydrochloric  acid  (1  +  1)  and  dilute
with water to 15 mL. If necessary, filter through a small
filter,  washing  the  evaporating  dish  and  filter  with  10
mL  of  water.  Dilute  to  25  mL  with  water.  For  the
standard,  dilute  a  solution  containing  0.01  mg  of  lead
ion (Pb) and 3 mL of dilute hydrochloric acid (1 + 1) to
25  mL  with  water.  Adjust  the  pH  of  both  solutions  to
between   3   and   4   (using   a   pH   meter)   with   dilute
ammonium  hydroxide  (10%  NH
3
)  or  with  1  N  acetic
acid, and dilute with water to 40 mL. To each solution,
add  10  mL  of  freshly  prepared  hydrogen  sulfide  water
and compare. The sample solution should be no darker
than the standard.
8. 9   Arsenic  and  Antimony  (as  As)   —  To  a  500  mL
separatory  funnel,  add  260  mL  (200  g)  of  sample,  20
mL  of  water,  and  1  mL  of  sodium  hydroxide  reagent
solution.  Shake  well  for  30  seconds  and  allow  the  two
layers  to  separate.  Carefully  draw  off  the  aqueous
(lower)   layer   into   a   150   mL   beaker.   Repeat   the
extraction  twice  more,  combining  the  three  aqueous
extracts.
8. 9.1   Add  15  mL  of  nitric  acid  and  5   mL  of  sulfuric
acid  and  evaporate  to  dense  fumes  of  sulfur  trioxide.
Cool, cautiously add 10 mL of water, and re-evaporate
to  dense  fumes  of  sulfur  trioxide.  Cool  and  cautiously
wash  into  a  generator  flask  with  water  to  make  a
volume  of  35  mL.  Proceed  as  described  in  the  General
Method  for  Arsenic  (and  Antimony)  under  SEMI  C1,
Section  3.4.5,  starting  with  the  sentence  which  begins
&quot;Swirl   the   flask....&quot;   Any   red   color   in   the   silver
diethyldithiocarbamate  solution  of  the  sample  should
not exceed that for the standard containing 0.002 mg of
arsenic (As).
8. 10    Trace   Elements   —   By   a   suitab le   emission
spectrographic  procedure,  determine  for  each  of  the
specified  trace  elements  that  its  content  is  not  greater
than   the   stated   specification   limit   (see   SEMI   C1,
Section  3.5,  Guidelines  for  Determination  of  Trace
Elements by Emission Spectrography).

NOTE  2:  Each  laboratory  is  responsible  for  verifying  the
validity of the method within its own operation.</li><li>1    Assay   —   Accurately   weigh   a   g lass-stoppered
conical flask containing about 30 mL of water. Deliver
from  a  pipet  about  3  mL  of  sample  near  the  water
surface,  stopper  immediately,  and  reweigh.  Dilute  to
about  50  mL  with  water,  add  methyl  orange  indicator
solution,  and  titrate  with  standardized  1  N  sodium
hydroxide to a red-to-yellow color change.<h1>%Assay</h1>mL

solution  (APHA  No.  500)  to  100  mL  with  water.
Compare this standard (APHA No. 10) with 100 mL of
sample  in  Nessler  tubes.  View  vertically  over  a  white
background.  The  sample  must  be  no  darker  than  the
standard.</li><li>3   Extractable  Organic  Substanc es  —  Cool  110  mL
of   sample   in   an   ice   bath.   Add   5   mL   of   2,2,4-
trimethylpentane  and  100  mL  of  water  to  each  of  two
250  mL  separatory  funnels.  To  a  third  funnel  add  100
mL of water and 5 mL of the standard (see below). To
the  first  funnel  add  100  mL  of  the  cooled  sample,  and
100 mL of water to each of the remaining two. Stopper,
shake  well,  and  allow  the  layers  to  separate.  Inject  1.0
μL of each of the 2,2,4-trimethylpentane extracts into a
gas  chromatograph  with  a  flame  ionization  detector.
The   following   conditions   have   been   found   to   be
satisfactory:  Column  —  20%  Carbowax  20  M  on</li></ol></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-tags-row row margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/tags/semi">SEMI</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/tags/standard">Standard</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/your-org/semiconductor-docs/tree/main/docs/standards/semi/semi-chapter-133.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>编辑此页</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="文件选项卡"></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#see-note-1" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">(See NOTE 1.)</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">文档</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/ic-design/intro">芯片设计</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/process/intro">工艺制造</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/eda-tools/intro">EDA工具</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/standards/intro">协议标准</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">社区</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/your-org/semiconductor-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/blog">技术博客</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">更多</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/blog">更新日志</a></li><li class="footer__item">
