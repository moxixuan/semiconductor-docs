SEMI F73-1102 © SEMI 20023 K peak with Fe K peak interferes with determinationof low levels of Manganese in Iron-Chromium matrix. 8 Apparatus8.1 Instrumentation  Any SEM instrument used forthis method must be capable of a minimum point-to-point resolution of 30 nm, as measured with a NIST4traceable standard. Any commercially available SEMwith image recording capabilities of at least 100 cm2image and an EDS analyzer capable of 170 eV or lessFWHM resolution for Mn K may be employed.8.2 The SEM shall have a sample stage capable ofaligning the sample to provide multiple areas of viewwith the orientation of the electron beam approximatelynormal to the surface, and to optimize secondaryelectron and X-ray signal collection efficiencies.8.3 Grid Overlay  A transparent grid overlay of gridsize equal to 1.814 micrometers multiplied by the pre-selected magnification in the range 3000 to 3600 (gridsize would be 6.35 mm \[=  inch\] square for 3500magnification). The grid lines shall be as fine aspossible but clearly visible. The grid overlay shall bedesigned to overlay the image of a photomicrographwith 252 grids (18 by 14 grids for the 3.5 by 4.5 inchimage of a standard Polaroid photomicrograph) withminimal interference from alphanumeric informationrecorded with the photomicrograph, but withoutreference to any features in the photomicrograph. Therows and columns of the grid overlay may be indexedwith alphanumerics to identify and locate specificfeatures in the photomicrographs (see examples inAppendices 1 and 2). It is suggested that a fixedreference point for the edges of the photomicrograph beestablished to be consistently used in all overlays. 9 Reagents and Materials9.1 Sample Preparation Materials  Equipmentrequired to section the test specimen without damagingor contaminating the surfaces to be analyzed. A clean,dry hacksaw or dry bandsaw is recommended, using aslow cutting speed to avoid excessive sample heating.9.2 Sample Mounting Materials  Sample mountingholders specific to the SEM instrument used.Conductive paste or tape used to adhere the sample tothe holder must be vacuum stable and applied so thatthe area of analytical interest is not contaminated. 10 Safety Precautions 4 National Institute of Standards and Technology, 100 Bureau Drive,Stop 3460,Gaithersburg, MD 20899, ( 301) 975-NIST (6478) TTY (301)975-8295, website: www.nist.gov. 10.1 This test method does not purport to address thesafety considerations associated with use of highvoltage, vacuum, electron and X-ray producingequipment.10.2 The method assumes a SEM and EDS analystwith adequate skill level as well as knowledge ofinstrumentation and associated safety precautions. 11 Test Specimen11.1 Specimens are to be sectioned to appropriate sizefor the particular SEM instrument. Any samplepreparation technique used shall avoid introducingcontamination onto the surface to be measured. Inaddition, preparation must avoid heating of the samplein excess of approximately 100°C to avoid oxidegrowth or change in surface composition. Slow speeddry cutting is recommended.11.2 After preparation, samples shall be protected fromcontamination by means such as sealing innoncontaminating bags or wrapping in clean aluminumfoil. Appropriate cleaning of the analysis surface toremove sample preparation residues is allowed but notrequired. Any such cleaning procedures should bestated in the report. After sectioning, samples shouldbe analyzed promptly.11.3 The samples shall be analyzed in the uncoatedcondition; ie, without sputtering with a conductivecoating. 12 Preparation of Apparatus12.1 The SEM shall be in good condition to assureproper performance in accordance with themanufacturers specifications. 13 Calibration and Standardization13.1 Instrument calibration for magnification and EDSperformance shall be performed in accordance withASTM E 766 and ANSI-IEEE 759 and/or theinstrument manufacturers recommendations. Themagnification should be calibrated at the workingdistance selected. Calibration frequency shall be perinstrument manufacturers recommendations. 14 Procedure14.1 The sample is to be mounted in accordance withmanufacturer's recommendations and in a mannerconsistent with high vacuum analytical procedures. Thesample shall be oriented such that the areas of interestfor SEM imaging can be viewed at 70 to 90° incidenceangle of the electron beam to the surface with optimumsecondary electron collection efficiency, and the abilityto re-orient the sample for optimization of X-ray

&lt;!-- Page 2 --&gt;

SEMI F73-1102 © SEMI 2002 4 collection efficiency. Any adhesives used to mountsamples must not contaminate the surface to beanalyzed. To remove loosely adhered surface particles,the sample may be blown off immediately beforeintroduction into the SEM with clean, dry, 0.1micrometer filtered gas.14.2 Place the sample in the SEM chamber forpumpdown. Activate the electron beam when vacuumconditions meet manufacturers recommendations. Theinstrument accelerating voltage should be a consistentlyselected value within the range 15 to 25 Kev; 20 KeV issuggested. The working distance should be within therange recommended by the instrument manufacturer.Sample position (tilt angle and orientation) may beadjusted to optimize EDS detector collection efficiencyfor EDS analysis.14.3 Increase the magnification to ≥ 400 for initialfocus; adjust instrument parameters for astigmatism andother anomalies. Decrease magnification to 200 andmove the sample while viewing until an area judged asrepresentative of the whole is in view. The area to beanalyzed should be as free of particles and defectfeatures produced by sample preparation as possible.14.4 Refocus and record images of this area at 200,1000, and a pre-selected, consistently usedmagnification within the range 3000 to 3600. Moveto another representative area and record an image atthe same 30003600 magnification. Move to a thirdrepresentative area and record another image at the30003600 magnification.14.5 Each area selected for recording should include adefect or metallurgical feature to demonstrate properfocusing, contrast adjustment and resolution capability.Contrast adjustment should be performed per thetechnique described in Section 4.7.2.1 of ScanningElectron Microscopy and X-Ray Microanalysis. 5 Alldefects and/or features for which the change in signalS due to the contrast exceeds the noise N by a factorof 5 minimum must be clearly distinguishable in theimage recorded (see Section 4.5 of reference 5).14.6 If any inclusions or contamination are noted in the30003600 images, EDS analysis of representativedefect(s) may be performed if requested by thecompany for which the test method is performed.Collect X-ray signals for a sufficient length of time toobtain an integrated count of ≥ 250,000 within therange of 0 to 10 keV. 5 Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-Ray Microanalysis: A Textfor Boilogists, Materials Scientists, and Geologists; Joseph I.Goldstein, Dale E. Newbury, Patrick Echlin, David C. Joy, A. D.Romig, Jr., Charles E. Lyman, Charles Fiori, Eric Lifshin; SecondEdition, Plenum Press, New York (1992). 15 Calculations or Interpretation of Results15.1 The 30003600 recorded images shall be placedunder the transparent overlay grid. The number of gridsquares that contain all or part of a surface defect shallbe counted and summed for each photomicrograph.Each such grid square shall only be counted once; it isnot the intent of this Test Method to count individualdefects. If a defect appears in more than one adjacentgrid square, each grid square occupied shall be counted.NOTE 2: Examples of scanning electron micrographsoverlaid with an alphanumeric indexed grid showing specifictypes of defects with comments on their locations andwhether they should be counted may be viewed athttp://www.semi.org/web/wstandards.nsf/url/SurfaceAnalysisExamples.15.2 Surface film residues resulting from impropercleaning are generally diffuse and difficult to quantify.These residues, if present, are counted as one perimage. Particles that loosely adhere to the surface mustbe presumed to be artifacts of sample preparation orexposure, and therefore shall be ignored.15.3 Peaks appearing in the EDS spectra shall beidentified and the spectra labeled to indicate whether itis a representative area, or identified as a defect from aphotomicrograph. 16 Reporting Results16.1 A tabular summary of defects counted per 30003600 photomicrograph shall be presented.Additionally, the table should indicate an average ofdefect counts and the maximum from the three 30003600 images. An example of a table reporting defectcounting results and the photomicrographs from whichthe defect counts were taken are shown in Appendix 1.16.2 All photomicrographs are to be permanentlylabeled with sample identification, magnification, amagnification scale bar, date, and analyst identification.The photomicrographs should be available forinspection upon request.16.3 EDS spectra are to be labeled with the sameinformation, plus peak identifications. If anyinstrument parameters (e.g., tilt angle) were changed forEDS analysis, these must be noted. If peak heightdifferences are such that adequate representation of allpeaks cannot be made from the same plot, two plotshaving different scaling shall be included.Identification of each defect analyzed, either by arrowon photomicrograph or by notation of grid position,shall be made.

SEMI F75-1102 © SEMI 20021 SEMI F75-1102GUIDE FOR QUALITY MONITORING OF ULTRAPURE WATER USED INSEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING This guide was technically approved by the Global Facilities Committee and is the direct responsibility of theNorth American Facilities Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on August 29, 2002. Initially available at www.semi.org September 2002; to be publishedNovember 2002. 1 Purpose1.1 These guides provide recommendations for facilityengineers and other manufacturing and qualityprofessionals who may be responsible for establishingprograms to monitor and control the quality of theirultrapure water (UPW) systems through to point-of-use(POU). These guides may be used to help determine theparameters that should be monitored for UPW that isproduced, distributed and used throughout themanufacturing facility, and the frequency and locationof testing.NOTE 1: These suggested guides are published as technicalinformation and are intended for informational purposes only. 2 Scope2.1 UPW is used extensively in the production ofsemiconductor devices for all wet processing steps.Ultrapure water systems need to be tested andmonitored to ensure that the UPW being producedmatches the specifications established by themanufacturing process. The purity of the UPW mayaffect device yield unless a wide range of parameters isclosely controlled at the point of distribution (POD).Semiconductor devices are currently being designedwith smaller linewidths (&lt; 0.130.18 m) and are moresusceptible to low level impurities.2.2 UPW systems are monitored for continuousperformance for desired and achievable levels ofquality. Action limits are generally set to determinewhen system performance data warrants that correctiveaction is needed. Table 1 Parameters and Range ofPerformance in SEMI F63 may be a useful referencefor establishing quality levels.2.3 In more critical processes, the quality of the UPWalso needs to be monitored at the POU where the UPWis in contact with the wafer. The quality of the UPWshould not be expected to be identical to the quality ofthe UPW being produced at final filter (FF), which isnot subject to conditions within the tool or distributionsystem.2.4 These guides logically follow the series of SEMIguides developed for UPW, which include a standarddefining the performance of a UPW system, and a standard defining the quality of UPW (see referencesection). The Schematic of a Typical Ultrapure WaterSystem in Figure 1 of SEMI F61 may be a usefulreference for determining sampling points.2.5 Guides are provided concerning the frequency andlocation of sampling for those parameters that are notavailable from on-line analyzers. Frequency ofsampling should be based on the specifications set bymanufacturing for the quality of the POD UPW, thenumber and locations of on-line analyzers, the stabilityof the incoming feed water to the system, and thehistorical performance of the UPW system over time.2.6 These guides may also be used to establish processcontrol criteria for the incoming feedwater,performance of UPW system components and POUrinse baths.2.7 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 These guides have been developed withconsideration of various other sources deemed to berelevant for this purpose. However this guide was notintended to be identical to or consistent with any otherindustry document or standard.3.2 Monitoring and testing of recycled or reclaimedwater systems are not specifically addressed in theseguides. Additional test parameters, such asquantification and identification of organic species inreclaim water, should be added to monitoring programsfor reclaim and reuse waters.3.3 Measuring the purity of UPW can provechallenging. Many on-line instruments (sodiumanalyzers, TOC analyzers, silica analyzers, opticalparticle counters, non-volatile residue analyzers)provide very low limits of detection but may not becapable of being calibrated in the range of detection ormay have very poor accuracy at low levels. On-lineanalyzers should primarily be used for trend analysis.Many tests can still be performed more accurately andreproducibly in a laboratory environment but taking

Consequently, trends observed in the values maybe more meaningful than absolute values, especially forcertain on-line monitors calibrated for ultrasensitivedetection. In addition, online and offline measurementsmay not correlate depending on the measurementtechnique and level of sensitivity of the measurement. 8 Tests For Monitoring UPW Production andDistributionNOTE 4: Since SEMI Guides do not require analytical data ormethods to support them, the recommendation of specificanalytical methods are only for informational purposes.Alternative methods may also be applicable.NOTE 5: See Table 1 at the end of this document forsummary of recommended testing frequency and samplingpoints.8.1 Resistivity (megohm-centimeters)8.1.1 Resistivity (the inverse of conductivity) is ageneral measure of ionic activity and is measured by anon-line meter. The resistivity of UPW should beapproximately 18.2 mΩcm depending on the resolutionof the instrument.NOTE 6: 18.25 mΩcm is the theoretical upper limit for purewater at 25C.8.2 Total Oxidizable (Organic) Carbon (TOC) (ppb)8.2.1 Carbon Sources in Water Supplies8.2.1.1 Incoming feed water contains both inorganicand organic carbon. Inorganic carbon as dissolvedcarbon dioxide (CO2), bicarbonate, and carbonate canbe present at high ppm levels according to the geologyof the water supply. Organic carbon reflects biologicalinput and man-made contaminants such as oils,pesticides, and fertilizers. Ground and well watersnormally have significantly lower organic content thansurface waters. To remove the majority of organics,most UPW systems employ reverse osmosis; anionexchange resin and ultraviolet (UV) destruction are alsoemployed to remove organics. Some volatile organics,such as trihalomethanes (THM), may be controlled bythe use of vacuum degasification. The control oforganics is essential for preventing organic fouling andmaintaining resin beds at high efficiency. In addition,

&lt;!-- Page 31 --&gt;

SEMI F75-1102 © SEMI 20023 reduced organic matter will limit the nutrients availablefor bacteria growth and thus biofilm development.Increasing TOC values at the FF can indicatedegradation and/or fouling of system components,contamination from routine operational maintenance, orreturn contamination from the factory. Changes in theincoming feed water due to seasonal or extremeweather conditions can also cause increases in TOCreadings.8.2.2 Method of TOC Measurement for Source Water8.2.2.1 There are various methods for measuring TOC,and several TOC analyzers are available. TOCmeasurement generally involves the oxidation oforganic materials by means of temperature, UVradiation, and/or chemicals. The CO 2 produced by thesereactions can then be measured by non-dispersiveinfrared analysis (NDIR) or conductivity (resistivity)differential. The exact method utilized will varydepending on the TOC instrumentation employed andthe method may also affect the TOC readings asdifferent methods have different recoveries of variousorganics. Some instruments will also require the use ofa carrier gas such as air or nitrogen, while othersmeasure TOC directly.8.2.3 Monitoring TOC in the UPW System8.2.3.1 TOC is a useful test to measure the organicremoval effectiveness of the UPW system componentsincluding Carbon, RO, Degasification, and IonExchange. Suggested measurement points are cityfeed, pre and post RO membrane, and final filter, with aminimum frequency that reflects possible changes inorganics from the feed source or UPW components.After the RO, TOC drops from low ppm levels in thesource water to mid ppb range, and to single digit ppblevels after the mixed resin beds and UV TOCreduction units.8.2.4 Monitoring TOC at the POU8.2.4.1 TOC may be measured at the point-of-use todetermine quality changes from the distribution systemand the manufacturing tool. Short wavelength UV (185nm) is capable of breaking up residual organics intocharged organic molecules. TOC which survives to thepoint of use in a UPW system are typically eitherlight molecules or small fragments of largermolecules such as acetate and formate. While low TOCmeans that the UPW system is working effectively toeliminate the source water organic load, this test is notan accurate measure of sterility of a UPW system. Inaddition, TOC levels at POU can also reflect carryoverfrom chemical baths and contaminants in cleanroom air.8.3 Dissolved Oxygen (ppb)8.3.1 Dissolved oxygen (DO) content can be controlled, if desired. Rinsing hydrogen passivatedsilicon wafer surfaces with high DO UPW can result inetching of the silicon by the oxygenated UPW and lossof control of gate oxide thickness.8.4 Particulate Matter (Particles/L)8.4.1 Sources of Particles in Ultrapure Water Supplies8.4.1.1 Particles that adhere to wafer surfaces at eachstep of the integrated circuit device manufacture mayimpair the application of thin-films andphotolithographic substances, and ultimately causediscrete and integrated transistors to fail because ofresultant physical imperfections. Particles originate inthe incoming city water and may also be generatedfrom degradation of the UPW system components oroperational activities. Incoming source water contains ahigh level of particles and is initially filtered byprefilters and mixed media in order to remove grossphysical turbidity in the micron range.8.4.1.2 Following reverse osmosis, source waterparticles have been greatly reduced, as the ROmembranes also reject particles. It is essential tominimize the particle load to the RO to preventmembrane fouling and premature or frequent ROcleanings. From the RO outlet forward in the system,the particle load in the UPW originates from systemcomponents. Particle sources can be RO membranemodules, piping components, valves and other similarcontrol devices, tank linings, resin fines and othersources where materials are undergoing wear ordegradation and are shedding particles.8.4.1.3 After the ion-exchange resin beds, increasinglysmaller dimension filters are used in the range 0.2 to 1.0microns to remove residual particles and resin fines. Inmost ultrahigh purity applications, ultra filtration at10,000 molecular weight is utilized. In most UPWsystems, the presence of significant quantities of sub-micron particles at the final filter may indicate thebreakdown of upstream UPW system components. Inaddition, POU filters on tools can be a source ofcontamination if not maintained.8.4.2 Optical Particle Counters (OPC)8.4.2.1 On-line methods using laser optical particlecounting technology are recommended for trendanalysis and specification compliance. Theseinstruments can monitor particles in the 0.03 to &gt; 0.5micron range depending on the system componentbeing tested. Particle counting using an OPC requires agood sample port connection to eliminate false counts.Good counter maintenance, including annual calibrationand replacement of tubing and fittings is criticalespecially if monitoring particles ≤ 0.05 microns. Inorder to monitor trend analysis with good statistical

&lt;!-- Page 32 --&gt;

SEMI F75-1102 © SEMI 2002 4 process control (SPC), the number of particles persample interval should be sufficient for good statistics(e.g. &gt; 20 particles per sample interval). For example,to obtain a coefficient of variation (standarddeviation/mean) of 10%, it is necessary that at least 100particles greater than the control be counted.8.4.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Analysisor Direct Count Analysis of Particles and Bacteria8.4.3.1 SEM is used to analyze particles and bacteriawithin the UPW system. Three major aspects of theSEM method are the enumeration of particles,enumeration of bacteria and the determination of theelemental composition of the captured particles.Depending on the particulate level in the UPW, a largevolume of UPW is filtered on-line, typically at the finalfilter. Due to particles created by the act of samplingand the preexisting particles found normally on a newfilter prior to use, a volume of over 1000 liters may berequired to get a statistically valid result. In thelaboratory, the filter is removed from the filter holderand placed in the vacuum chamber of a SEMinstrument. A focused beam of electrons is scannedacross the filter, systematically allowing the size, shapeand distribution of the particles to be measured. Theelectron microscope is capable of extremely high powerdetection (10,000 magnification), and the countingprocess may be automated. Bacteria and particles in the0.05 to &gt; 0.5 micron range are detected and counted.8.4.3.2 When SEM particle capture filters are installedat critical areas in the UPW system on a continuousbasis, they may be utilized to determine the source andnature of intermittent particle excursions.8.4.4 Identification of Particles8.4.4.1 As part of the SEM analysis, an EnergyDispersive X-ray Beam (EDX) may be applied to aparticle, which produces a spectral output of thecomposition of the particle. EDX results allow thebasic classification of organic and inorganiccomponents. Elemental compositions are provided thatcan be used to trace the source of particulates. Forexample, a particle having Cr and Fe peaks is probablyfrom a stainless steel source, while one having C and Fpeaks is most probably composed of fluoropolymermaterials.8.5 Bacteria8.5.1 Sources of Bacteria in Water Supplies8.5.1.1 Incoming city water supplies and UPW systemcomponents are all potential sources of biologicalcontaminants if not monitored and controlled. Viable(live) counts are usually non-detectable or very low inthe city water due to chlorination. Chlorine removal andlow flow areas in the components are the main catalysts for rapid biological growth in an UPW system. Foulingof RO membranes and ion-exchange resins may occur,requiring costly remediation. Seasonal variations maygreatly change the bacterial count of source water.8.5.1.2 The oligotrophic nature of the UPW causes thebacteria to become hydrophobic which creates athermodynamic adhesion to the wall. The bacteria,once adhered to the wall have a higher degree ofprobability of having the nutrients required for growthbrought by them than the planktonic bacteria in thesystem. This process initiates the creation of a biofilm.While some system owners employ sanitizationprograms in hopes of safeguarding against microbialactivity, biofilm can be prove resistant and maypermanently coat the inaccessible surfaces of valvesand dead-legs. Despite the fact that UPW systems aredesigned to be hostile to most bacterial species, theformation of biofilm on filters, in membranes, and inion-exchange resins is widespread and periodicflourishing of bacterial colonies can be a costly long-term problem. Once in the tool, live bacteria canmultiply further particularly in low flow area and posean ever greater threat.8.5.2 Viable Bacteria by Culture8.5.2.1 Replicate samples are collected at eachsampling point in sterile containers, passed throughspecial sterile filters, and then dosed with a growthmedium. In an incubator, bacteria are cultured andgrow to form colonies. The bacteria colonies arecounted under low power magnification after aspecified interval and at a specified temperature.Different methods will enumerate different results.Results may vary depending upon factors such assample volume, growth media, incubation time andtemperature, and enumeration methods. It may benecessary to evaluate different methods to determinethe best recovery for a specific UPW system. Bacteriaresults are reported as colony-forming units (CFU) perunit volume (e.g. 100 mL or 1000 mL). For very lowbacteria UPW systems, larger sized samples may becollected to provide lower detection limits. Largervolumes can be filtered using this method, making thebacterial counts more statistically significant.8.5.3 Total Bacteria by Epifluorescence8.5.3.1 After collection, samples are filtered ontopolycarbonate membranes, which are then stained withdyes that cause biological materials to fluoresce underultraviolet light. A high power microscope is employedto visually identify bacteria, both live and dead, and acounting method is used to give statistical accuracy forthe sample size. This test provides accurateinformation about actual bacterial content (both viableand non-viable) of the UPW system, rather than an

&lt;!-- Page 33 --&gt;

SEMI F75-1102 © SEMI 20025 estimate of bacteria that is capable of being culturedduring a growth opportunity (the culture method). Online samples may also be obtained utilizing a methodsimilar to that of the SEM particle capture method.Larger volumes can be filtered using this methodmaking the bacterial counts more statisticallysignificant. The culture method may also be performedconcurrently to determine if an increase in levels is dueto live or dead bacteria.8.5.4 Total Viable Organisms by Scan RDI8.5.4.1 Scan RDI is a semi-automated method ofmeasuring total viability counts. The method is able todetect a single cell based on direct measurements of cellactivity and includes bacteria and other live organismsthat may be present in biofilm.8.5.4.2 The sample is filtered through a membrane anda counterstain is added to minimize backgroundfluorescence. Viable organisms are labeled using anonfluorescent substrate that diffuses across the cellmembrane. The labeling differentiates between viableand dead cells based on the presence or absence ofesterase activity and intact cell membranes. Only viablecell with membrane activity have the ability to performthis cleavage and retain the fluorescent label. No cellgrowth is required. The membrane is then scanned by asolid-phase laser-scanning cytometer. The cells aredetected, counted and verified within minutes.8.6 Silica8.6.1 Forms of Silica in UPW Systems8.6.1.1 Silica exists primarily in two forms as silicatesand as polymeric silica. Silicates are referred to asdissolved silica and are reactive to molybdate using theheteropoly method. The polymeric forms are calledcolloidal silica or particulate silica and are notmeasured directly by on-line analyzers. As pH in aUPW system is lowered, silicates polymerize to formcolloidal silica, which range in size from a fewnanometers to several tenths of a micron.8.6.1.2 As with TOC, RO membranes are responsiblefor the gross rejection of silica in incoming waters.Within the UPW system, dissolved silica is furtherremoved in the anionic ion exchange resin beads.However, dissolved silica is only weakly attracted tothe anionic resins, and is one of the first species to beliberated when the resin beds approach exhaustion.After anion resins are exhausted, increasingly highlevels of silica are released into the UPW stream. Sincedissolved silica is only weakly negatively charged, theon-line resistivity meter is not sensitive enough todetect silica leakage prior to total resin bed exhaustion,i.e. breakthrough. It is very important to detect this on-set of silica breakthrough before a drop in resistivity. If this does occur, then Cl - and other monovalent ions maypass from the resin to the point of use. This would alsobe accompanied by a decrease in the resistivity from theresin beds. This occurs because ions that are stored onthe resin beds over a period of time become liberated astheir exchange sites are taken over by other higher-affinity ions (e.g. nitrate, sulfate).8.6.2 Dissolved Silica Techniques8.6.2.1 For the measurement of dissolved silica, acolorimetry heteropoly blue method is used. Dissolvedsilica reacts with the molybdate reagent at acidic pH,and forms a yellow complex in direct proportion toconcentration. A reducing agent is added to theprepared sample, causing a blue color to develop. Thiscolor change can be quantified by a sensitivespectrophotometer for ppb to sub-ppb levels ofdissolved silica. On-line instruments providecontinuous monitoring of UPW systems. IonChromatography may also be used to measuredissolved silica.8.6.3 Total Silica Technique8.6.3.1 Since all forms of silica are not reactive in theheteropoly method, the quantity of total silica in UPWmust be verified independently. Techniques such asICP-MS are capable of quantifying the silicon presentto sub ppb levels after pre-concentration. The methoddetection limit of total silica obtained by this techniqueis in the range of 0.5 ppb.8.6.4 Measurement Methods For Total Silica8.6.4.1 Total Silica may be measured by GraphiteFurnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GFAAS),Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic-EmissionSpectroscopy (ICP-AES) or Inductively CoupledPlasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) at ppb levels.8.6.5 Colloidal Silica8.6.5.1 The difference between total silica anddissolved silica is assumed to be represented by thecolloidal form of silica. Colloidal silica is partiallyremoved by the RO membrane, however, some hotUPW feed streams may carry a higher concentration ofcolloidal silica. Colloidal silica cannot be detected byon-line resistivity or dissolved silica testing, but may bedetected as a component of non-volatile residue.8.7 Non-Volatile Residue (NVR)8.7.1 Non-volatile residue in UPW primarily consistsof dissolved inorganic material. In the final polishedUPW the most likely dissolved inorganic material issilica in both the dissolved and colloidal form. Theprimary source of this breakthrough silica is the anionresin bed as it approaches exhaustion. Sub-ppb levelsof dissolved silica can be detected as non-volatile

&lt;!-- Page 34 --&gt;

SEMI F75-1102 © SEMI 2002 6 residue. There is also evidence that as an ion-exchangebed approaches exhaustion, previously removeddissolved silica can be subsequently released ascolloidal silica if the pH in the ion-exchange bed isfavorable. There is currently no specific measurementof on-line colloidal silica, but detecting it as acomponent of non-volatile residue can be beneficial.8.7.2 Method of Measurement for NVR8.7.2.1 The on-line measurement of nonvolatile residueis based on the principle of determining residue afterevaporation of atomized ultrapure water droplets.Droplets evaporate in a fraction of a second leaving anultrafine nonvolatile residue particle agglomerate a fewnanometers in diameter; the size of which is related tothe amount of residue impurity originally present in theultrapure water. A condensation particle counter thenmonitors the concentration of ultrafine nonvolatileresidue particles. The measurement range of thistechnique is 0.01 parts per billion to 20 parts permillion.8.8 Ions8.8.1 Mass Balance and Ionic Removal in UPWSystems8.8.1.1 The ionic composition of natural waters is in adynamic equilibrium (mass balance) with the geologicalsource. The total dissolved solid (TDS) content iscomposed of negatively charged (anionic) andpositively charged (cationic) species that can beanalyzed by Ion Chromatography (IC). RO membranes,ion-exchange resins, and electronic deionization (EDI)are used to remove ionic species from water. The UPWresin beds need to be monitored because each unit has afixed capacity to remove ions over time. Weakly boundsingly charged (monovalent) ions such as Na+ and Cl-are continually displaced in favor of more highlycharged doubly charged (divalent) ions such as SO42-and Ca2+ throughout the life of the resin. When ionicbreakthrough occurs, the weakly bound ions areliberated in excess, and resin beds must be regenerated.8.8.2 Ion Chromatography Techniques8.8.2.1 Ionic (anions and cations) removal in UPWsystems can be quantified at very sensitive levels usingthe technique of ion chromatography. During ICanalysis, a UPW sample is injected into an analyticalcolumn packed with a special ion-exchange resin. Theions from the samples are eluted (washed) down thecolumn by a suitable eluent. Depending on theirbinding energy and sizes, the ions move down thecolumn at different speeds. In time, all of the ions areseparated and measured by a conductivity detector.External calibration of a sensitive conductivity detectoracross a wide range of concentrations allows accurate quantification of anion and cations. The anions andcations determined by IC are fluoride (F- ), chloride(Cl), nitrite (NO2- ), bromide (Br - ), nitrate (NO 3- ), sulfate(SO 42-). phosphate (PO 43- ) and lithium (Li+ ), sodium(Na+), ammonium (NH 4+ ), potassium (K+ ), magnesium(Mg 2+ ), calcium (Ca2+ ) respectively.8.8.3 Ions Critical in Semiconductor Processing8.8.3.1 Certain types of haze formation on wafersurfaces could be caused by high concentrations ofanions and cations on the silicon surface as residue.There could be other causes for haze formations,therefore, testing of anions and cations at the POU inthe rinse bath may be important to identify and preventthis source of contamination.8.9 Metals8.9.1 Measurement Methods8.9.1.1 Up to 68 metals may be determined byinstruments such as Graphite Furnace AtomicAbsorption Spectroscopy (GFAAS), InductivelyCoupled Plasma Atomic-Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) or Inductively Coupled Plasma-MassSpectrometry (ICP-MS).8.9.2 Sources of Trace Metals8.9.2.1 Trace metal concentrations in feed waters varyover orders of magnitude according to the geology ofsource rocks and the residence time of water in aquifersand surface systems. Surface water supplies are oftenmixed by the local municipal services, and seasonalvariations are also introduced as ground water and wellwaters are brought in and out of service. Consequently,periodic analysis of metals in incoming feedwater andat key points of the UPW system including after thefinal filter is essential so that significant changes inperformance may be corrected early in the process ofdeionization.8.9.3 Boron8.9.3.1 Boron is a trace element that, like silica, isweakly attracted to anion resins. Both elements serveas a flag for the onset of ionic breakthrough through theanion exchange resin. A rapid and systematic rise inthe boron content immediately after the resin bed istypical when ion-exchange resins approach exhaustionin the UPW system. Silica and boron breakthough ratesand each elements selectivity in the ion exchangeprocess is a matter of ongoing study. The safest route isto measure both, but at least to focus on the one mostprevalent in the city water feed stream.8.9.4 Contaminants from the Distribution System8.9.4.1 Certain heavy elements such as Zn, Mn, Ni, Cu,Cr, and Pb may be present as trace impurities in plastic

&lt;!-- Page 35 --&gt;

SEMI F75-1102 © SEMI 20027 (PFA and PVDF) components and are continuouslyleached into the UPW streams. Plastic lined metalcomponents such as pumps, storage tanks, and otherUPW processing vessels may develop pinholes, therebyleaching out heavy metal impurities into the UPWsystem.8.9.5 Contaminants from Feed Water8.9.5.1 The alkali metals (Na, K), alkali earths (Mg,Ca) and Fe comprise the bulk elements of most naturalwaters, and play a significant role in bulk waterchemistry including hardness, alkalinity and totaldissolved solids. Of these elements, sodium is the mostabundant and is present in final filter UPW at sub-ppblevel. Highly charged metals (Al, Fe, and Mn) have thepotential to coagulate and foul RO membranes, and Baand Sr can cause scaling of the RO and ion exchangeresins.8.9.6 Priority Metals in Semiconductor Processing8.9.6.1 Certain processing steps expose a wafer tocontamination from UPW in a unique way. Metalsfrom incoming materials (e.g., chemicals, wafers, etc.),deteriorating wafer processing equipment, and newprocesses and materials for deposited circuit layers canlead to cross contamination and high concentrations ofmetals gettering on the silicon wafer surface. Testingfor metals in the UPW at POU (e.g., the rinse bath) maybe important in identifying and preventing sources ofmetal contamination on the wafer. Certain otherelements, calcium, magnesium and aluminum, have anincreased ability to contaminate the oxides of wafers.There may be other metals that, depending on thesemiconductor process, can also act as harmfulcontaminants.8.9.7 Radioactive Elements8.9.7.1 Radioactive elements such as uranium andthorium can cause soft X-ray damage to devices whenpresent at ppt levels. These elements are detectable in afull ICP-MS scan. 9 Typical Monitoring Programs9.1 On-Line Monitoring9.1.1 On-line monitors for UPW are readily availablefrom a variety of manufacturers. Before selecting aninstrument for on-line monitoring an evaluation shouldbe made about 1.) sensitivity of measurements, 2.)accuracy of the measurements, 3.) reproducibility of themeasurements, 4.) calibration protocols for theinstrument, 5.) zero count for the instrument (particlecounters) and 6.) instrument cost and reliability.9.1.2 If on-line monitors are not available at criticalsampling points, or the sensitivity of the on-linemonitor is not sufficient to accurately measure at therequired levels, grab samples may be taken and sent toa qualified laboratory for equivalent testing. This off-line sampling and testing requires special apparatus andtrained personnel. A clear understanding of the limits ofeach method is required before its application.9.1.3 All on-line monitoring requires clean and tightsample port connections in order to eliminate falsecounts.9.2 Testing at critical sampling points, such as point-of-use, requires special sampling apparatus and trainedpersonnel. The enclosures and mini-environmentsaround wet benches that are designed to preventaccidental access and to isolate human contaminationfrom the wafer can make it difficult to sample the bath.However, contamination-free sampling can be done in asafe way using high purity fluoropolymer apparatus andtrained qualified personnel.9.3 The utilization of unbiased, independent andexperienced personnel in obtaining data at criticalsampling sites with the UPW system where on -lineinstrumentation is not available is essential indetermining the overall performance of the UPWsystem.9.4 See Table 1, UPW System Test Parameters,Sampling Points, and Recommended MonitoringFrequency for Assuring Good UPW System Operationfor sample point and monitoring frequencyrecommendations.

SEMI F77-0703 © SEMI 20031 SEMI F77-0703TEST METHOD FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL CRITICAL PITTINGTEMPERATURE TESTING OF ALLOY SURFACES USED INCORROSIVE GAS SYSTEMS This test method was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility ofthe North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on April 11, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org June 2003; to be published July 2003. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this test method is to determine therelative resistance to pitting corrosion of the wettedsurfaces of components intended for use in corrosivegas distribution systems for semiconductormanufacturing. This test method is intended todifferentiate between alloy compositions and processesintended to enhance the corrosion performance of thewetted surfaces. 2 Scope2.1 This test method describes a procedure, based onthe electrochemical critical pitting temperature (CPT),which is used to rank the pitting corrosion resistance ofwetted surfaces of tubing or test coupons ofrepresentative finished surfaces intended for use incorrosive gas systems. Pitting corrosion is believed tobe a major corrosion failure mode in semiconductor gasdelivery systems, particularly in components and tubingwelded and exposed to corrosive gases.2.2 This test method is an adaptation of ASTM G150.The adaptation describes a method for performing thetest method on coupons or wetted-surface sections cutfrom gas supply system components such as tubing. Itis an aqueous immersion method.2.3 The test method is reproducible and provides ametric (critical pitting temperature) in addition to aqualitative (visual) evaluation of corrosion resistance.2.4 This test method applies to materials as specified inSEMI Standards referenced in Section 4.1, and to weldsof these materials.2.5 This test method may also be used for othercorrosion resistant alloys and their welds not referencedin Section 4.1.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior touse. 3 Limitations3.1 Only analysts familiar with the instrumentation andtechnique should use this test method.3.2 The test conditions of this test method do notsimulate actual service in a corrosive gas supplysystem. Thus the test results may not correlate torelative corrosion resistance in a specific corrosive gasor corrosive gas supply system.3.3 The Critical Pitting Temperature (CPT) is validonly in a range of 10°C to 95°C. A CPT result greaterthan 95°C is not considered to be valid since it isapproaching the boiling point of the solution. A criticalpitting temperature (CPT) below 10°C shall only bereported as &lt; 10°C and may be an indication of crevicecorrosion.3.4 Since alloy composition and surface parameterscan affect the results of the test (e.g., surface finish), allvariables other than the one being tested must be fixedduring the test in order to obtain reproducible andcomparable results.3.5 The bias for this test has not yet been determined. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI F2  Specification for 316L Stainless SteelTubing for General Purpose SemiconductorManufacturing ApplicationsSEMI F17  Specification for High Purity QualityElectropolished 316L Stainless Steel Tubing,Component Tube Stubs, and Fittings made from TubingSEMI F19  Specification for the Finish of the WettedSurfaces of Electropolished 316L Stainless SteelComponentsSEMI F20  Specification for 316L Stainless SteelBar, Extruded Shapes, Plate, and Investment Castingsfor Components Used in High Purity SemiconductorManufacturing Applications

Fax: 1-610-832-9555. Website: http://www.astm.org. 6 Summary of Method6.1 The test method measures the critical pittingtemperature (CPT) by using a potentiostatic techniqueand a temperature scan. Specific types of specimenholders are used to minimize crevice corrosion, whichis another type of corrosion mechanism that cancomplicate the CPT result. The test is performed in anaqueous electrolyte solution, such as 1 M NaCl. Afterpolarizing the specimen to a potential above the pittingpotential, the temperature scan begins at 0°C. Thesolution is heated at a constant rate of 1°C/minute whilethe current is measured by means of apotentiostat/galvanostat instrument. The CPT, asdefined in Section 5.1.1, is the temperature at which thecurrent density increases above 100 A/cm2 for 60seconds. Pitting is normally confirmed by visual ormicroscopic observation of the specimen after testing asshown in Figure 1. Refer to Appendix X1 in ASTMG150 for a description of the relationship between thepitting potential and the critical pitting temperature.

SEMI F77-0703 © SEMI 20033 7 Possible Interferences7.1 Specimens must be examined after testing toconfirm pitting. A possible interference is failure bycrevice corrosion in which case the test is invalid.Crevice corrosion can occur at the seal of the specimenholder. Figure 2 shows the mechanism by whichcrevice corrosion occurs, and Figure 3 gives anexample of the typical morphology of crevice corrosionfrom a pitting potential test performed on type 316stainless steel using masked edges. It should also benoted that the critical crevice temperature (CCT) forAISI 316L is less than 10°C. Figure 2Mechanism for Crevice Corrosion(See Section 17.2.) Figure 3Examples of Crevice Corrosion (Dashed Circles) onType 316 Stainless Steel After a Pitting PotentialTest in 1 M NaCl at 35°C. 11  Magnification (SeeSection 17.1.) 8 Apparatus8.1 In general, refer to ASTM G150 for a detaileddescription of the apparatus and accessories necessary to carry out the CPT evaluation. Specifically, Sections6.1 to 6.9 of ASTM G150 describe the potentiostat, thepotential measuring instrument, the current measuringinstrument, the temperature controller, and thetemperature measurement instrumentation.8.2 Flat Specimens  The test cell for flat specimens(consisting of two options, G5-type cell and a flushed-port cell), are given in Appendices X2 and X3 ofASTM G150 with a detailed description of each.8.3 Tubular Specimens  The test cell can be modifiedfor testing tubular specimens. The modified test cellconsists of a 2-L glass beaker cut to 4.5 in. high andcapped with a polyethylene cover. A three-electrodeset up is used consisting of the test specimen, an SCEreference electrode inserted in a Luggin probe, and twographite rods as counter electrodes. See Figure 4 for themodified test cell set-up. Figure 4Modified Test Cell for CPT Testing of TubularSpecimens; Tubing Specimen is the WorkingElectrode 9 Test Specimens9.1 Flat Specimens  In general, refer to ASTM G150for a detailed description of the flat specimen.9.2 Tubing Specimens  Tubing specimens consist of2.0-in. lengths of tubing. The tubing should be faced,and the cut ends should be masked with a non-reactivelacquer.9.3 All specimens should be masked to isolate the testto the surface of interest only. This can beaccomplished by masking with a non-reactive lacquer,which can be baked to ensure optimum adhesion.

Sincesurface finish can effect the CPT results, surfacefinished should be done as consistently as possiblewithin a sample set. Details of the surface finishingprocess, parameters and characterization should beprovided in the test report as outlined in Section 15.9.5 Sampling  It is recommended that a minimum of3 specimens, and preferably 5 or more, should be usedto obtain statistical significance in the testing results.9.6 Test Area  In general, refer to ASTM G150,which states a minimum test area of 1 cm2. Thisminimum test area is required for both flat specimensand tubing specimens. 10 Reagents And Materials10.1 In general, refer to Section 8 of ASTM G150describing the purity of the reagents and water neededfor the test solution as well as the purity of the N 2purging gas.10.2 Standard Test Solution  Comparison of the CPTresults requires consistency in the test solution, so it isrecommended that a 1 M (mole/liter) sodium chloride(NaCl) electrolyte be used as electrolyte. However,because of the different processes gases used by thesemiconductor industry (HCl, HBr, Cl2, BCl3, HF,WF 6), it is possible to substitute another test solution torepresent the particular anion of the process gas whichmay impart different pitting characteristics (e.g., 1 MNaBr, or 1M NaF). 11 Applied Potential11.1 Stainless Steel  In general, refer to section 9 ofASTM G150, which provides the standard anodicpotential commonly used for most stainless steels (ananodic potential of 700 mV versus SCE at 25°C).Section 9 also provides an alternative potential if thereis uncertainty as to whether this potential is sufficientlyhigh to obtain a potential independent CPT.11.2 Alternative Alloys  Alloys other than 316Lstainless steel can be tested using the applied potentialgiven in Section 11.1. 12 Procedure12.1 In general refer to Section 10 of ASTM G150 fordetails on specimen mounting, cleaning, and placement, test solution preparation, test procedure, and completionof the test.12.2 Refer to Annexes A1 and A2 in ASTM G150 forguidelines to calibrate the specimen temperature.12.3 Tubing specimens  Tubing testing requiresdifferent specimen mounting and preparation than givenin Section 9 of ASTM G150. Tubing specimens shouldbe placed vertically in solution so that approximatelyone inch is submerged. 13 Visual Examination Of Test Specimen13.1 In general, refer to Section 11 of ASTM G150 fora description of the visual examination of the testspecimen. 14 Data Analysis14.1 In general, refer to Section 12 of ASTM G150 fordetails on evaluating the critical pitting temperature. 15 Reporting Results15.1 Section 13 of ASTM G150 provides a list ofmandatory information required in the test report.15.2 Other mandatory information that should beprovided are the starting test electrolyte composition,the diameter of the tubing for tubing specimens,identification of the surface finish process (e.g.,electropolish, passivation), and any other specificparameters or characterization related to the surfacefinish process. Welded and non-welded specimensshould also be clearly identified, as well the weldingprocedure used to weld the specimen. 16 Precision and Bias16.1 The precision of this test method is yet to bedetermined16.2 The bias of this test method is yet to bedetermined. 17 References17.1 Blum, Michael.

A1-1 PrincipleA1-1.1 Critical pitting temperature (CPT) is anelectrochemical test that determines the localizedcorrosion resistance of stainless steel and other alloys.The test is performed in a solution of sodium chloride(NaCl). The sample is polarized at 700 mVSCE whilethe temperature is gradually increased from 0°C at arate of 1°C/min. Above some critical temperature,pitting corrosion will occur signified by a rapid increasein measured current above 100 A/cm2 for 60 seconds.The experiment is monitored and controlled usingspecial software.
