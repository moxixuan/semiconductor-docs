SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL, SAFETY, AND HEALTH
(ESH) EVALUATION OF SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING
EQUIPMENT
NOTICE:  This  safety  guideline  does  not  purport  to
address all of the safety issues associated with its use. It
is  the  responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  guideline  to
establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and
determine  the  applicability  of  regulatory  limitations
prior to use.
NOTE: This entire document was revised in 1995.
1  Purpose
1. 1    The   purpose   of   this   document    is   to   provide
guidance to the equipment manufacturer or supplier, the
evaluator,  and  the  user  to  define  responsibilities  and  to
ensure    the    objective    evaluation    of    designs    and
equipment.
1. 2   Preservation  of  employee  safe ty  and  conformance
to   environmental   regulations   are   important   criteria
when       selecting       semiconductor       manufacturing
equipment.  A  basic  expectation  is  that  the  equipment
manufacturer  will  design  and  build  inherently  safe  (to
the  operator,  facility,  and  environment)  equipment  and
will provide documentation that the equipment has been
evaluated  against  a  specific  set  of  criteria,  verifying
conformance thereto.
1. 3   A  safety  evaluation  is  importa nt  for  a  variety  of
reasons,     including:     operator     safety,     equipment
reliability,   conformance   to   regulatory   (e.g.,   OSHA,
EPA,  local  fire  and  building  codes)  and  insurance
requirements.  These  are  intended  to  ensure  a  safe  and
environmentally responsible workplace.
2  Scope
2. 1   This  document  defines  the  req uirements  for  ESH
evaluation of equipment design and operation.
2. 2  These guidelines include:
• Purpose
• Scope
• Referenced Documents
• Terminology
• Codes, Regulations, and Standards
• Requirements for Third Party Evaluators
• Contracting with an Evaluator
• Documentation  Provided  to  the  Evaluator  by  the
Supplier
• Evaluation Methods
• Contents of Reports
• Provision of Reports to Potential Users
2. 3   The  evaluation  program  is  des igned  to  be  used  in
addressing  the  ESH  aspects  of  new,  refurbished,  or
resold process tools prior to the tool being delivered to
the user.
2. 4    The   evaluator   may   be   within   th e   supplier’s
organization.   As   some   equipment   suppliers   do   not
maintain  a  comprehensive  ESH  equipment  evaluation
program  in-house,  third  party  contractor(s)  may  be
used.  In  either  case,  the  evaluator  should  meet  the
requirements listed in Section 6.

4  Terminology
4. 1  supplier — The party providin g the equipment to,
and  communicating  directly  with,  the  user.  It  may  be
the  manufacturer  or  an  equipment  representative  or
distributor.   The   supplier   has   the   responsibilities   of
obtaining     the     required     information     from     the
manufacturer or other sources and of providing it to the
evaluator.
4. 2     user    —    The    purchaser    of    semi conductor
manufacturing who will use the equipment.
5  Codes, Regulations, and S tandards
5. 1   Semiconductor  equipment  sho uld  conform  to  the
applicable   codes,   regulations,   and   standards.   The

evaluation  should  include  accordance  with  the  codes,
guidelines,  and  the  local  regulations  of  potential  users.
To   assist   in   this,   the   supplier   should   provide   the
evaluator   with   a   list   of   jurisdictions   in   which   the
supplier intends to market the equipment.
6  Requirements for Third Pa rty Evaluators
6. 1   The  evaluator  should  have  at  l east  five  years’
experience    in    the    semiconductor    equipment    or
fabrication or similar industry and:
a. be  established  in  accordance  with  ANSI  Z34.1,
Third Party Certification Program; or
b. consist   of   individual(s)   who   are   registered   or
certified   professional(s)   in   the   discipline(s)   in
which the evaluations were performed; or
c. consist   of   individual(s)   with   baccalaureate   or
higher  degrees  in  related  technical  discipline(s)
(engineering or science).
NOTE: In the United States, the United Kingdom, and several
other  countries,  the  “baccalaureate”  or  “bachelor  of  science”
degree  is  awarded  upon  completion  of  a  technical  course  of
study,  typically  of  four  years,  at  a  college  or  university.  It  is
the  degree  prerequisite  for  professional  registration  in  most
U.S.   states   and   for   study   towards   a   master’s   degree   or
doctorate.
7  Contracting with an Evalu ator
7. 1  The supplier initiates the evalu ation by providing a
“scope  of  work”  to  the  evaluator.  This  scope  should
define   the   services   to   be   provided,   including   the
standards  and  guidelines  that  will  be  used  to  evaluate
the equipment and the responsibilities of each party.
7. 2  The evaluator is responsible on ly to the supplier.
7. 3   Changes  made  to  the  equipme nt  to  bring  it  into
accord  with  codes,  regulations,  and  guidelines  are  the
responsibility of the supplier.
8  Documentation Provided  to the Evaluator
by the Supplier
8. 1   Any  previous  evaluations  of  eq uipment  related  to
the     included     documents,     with     all     appropriate
documentation.
8. 2   Material  Safety  Data  Sheets  (M SDS’s)  for  all
chemicals  used  in  the  maintenance  of  the  equipment
and for those used in baseline and known, user-intended
processes.
8. 3   When  information  is  known  fo r  user  intended  or
baseline  process(s),  the  evaluator  should  be  provided
the  estimated  consumption  of  raw  materials  and  the
amount(s)  of  by-products  generated  as  described  in
Section 20.2.1 of SEMI S2.
8. 4      Copies     of     the     equipment’s     inst allation,
maintenance, and operation manuals.
8. 5  Copies of any hazard analysis  or safety reviews of
the subject equipment.
8. 6  A list of all assemblies and sub -assemblies.
8. 7  Design drawings and schemati cs.
9  Evaluation Methods
9. 1   The  evaluator  should  ensure  th e  review  of  the
supplier's documents (listed above) and the outlining of
deficiencies    with    corrective    and/or    improvement
recommendations.
9. 2   The  ESH  testing  and  evaluatio n  may  proceed
concurrently with the document review by agreement of
the parties.
9. 3   After  the  supplier  has  addresse d  all  deficiencies
noted  in  the  third  party  report,  the  supplier  should
review   the   actions   taken   with   the   evaluator.   If
appropriate,  the  evaluator  may  re-evaluate  some  or  all
of the areas addressed.
10  Contents of Reports
10. 1   An  interim  report  should  be  pr ovided  to  the
supplier   after   evaluator   has   performed   the   agreed
services.  It  should  include  an  overview  of  the  services
performed, the standards, guidelines, and codes against
which the equipment was evaluated, and the evaluator’s
findings.    Items    found    in    conformance    with    the
documents  should  be  documented  as  well  as  those
found to be deficient.
10. 2   The  evaluator’s  final  report  sh ould  be  provided
after the supplier and the evaluator have agreed that the
changes   made   have   brought   the   equipment   into
conformance   with   the   applicable   documents.   This
report  should  be  attached  to  the  supplier's  bid  to  a
potential user.
10. 3   If  the  evaluator  and  the  supplie r  differ  in  their
interpretation    of    requirements    of    the    applicable
documents,  the  creator  of  the  document  in  question
should   be   consulted   for   an   interpretation.   If   the
difference  remains  unresolved,  the  evaluator  should
include this and any other unresolved issues in its final
report.
10. 4  The final report should be sign ed by the evaluator
and should contain at least the following sections:
10. 4.1   Management  Summary  —  A  b rief  description
of  the  evaluation,  recommendations,  and  results.  A

SEMI S8-0705
SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR ERGONOMICS ENGINEERING OF
SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT
These  safety  guidelines  were  technically  approved  by  the  global  EH&S  Committee.    This  edition  was
approved for publication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on April 7, 2005.  It was available
at  www.semi.org  in  June  2005  and  on  CD-ROM  in  July  2005.    Originally  published  in  1995;  previously
published in 2003.
NOTICE: The official values in this guideline are expressed in The International System of Units (SI). Values that:
— are expressed in inch-pound (also known as “US Customary” or “English”) units,
— are enclosed in parentheses, and
— directly follow values expressed in SI units
are not official, are provided for reference only, and might not be exact conversions of the SI values.
1  Purpose
1. 1  These  guidelines  provide  ergonomics  design  principles  and  considerations  for  semiconductor  manufacturing
equipment.
1. 2  The  purpose  of  these  guidelines  is  to  promote  compatibility  between  the  user  and  the  equipment  in  the
manufacturing environment. The following general principles are integral to the ergonomics design and evaluation
of equipment:
1. 2.1  The equipment should be designed to optimize safety by distributing tasks. Tasks should be distributed among
hardware, software, and users to make the best use of their respective capabilities and to minimize limitations and
hazards. Appropriate distribution of tasks will also optimize performance.
1. 2.2  Equipment  should  be  designed  to  minimize  potential  for  errors  and  mishaps,  by  conforming  to  users’
expectations.
1. 2.3  The  equipment  design  should  reduce  fatigue  and  injury  by  fitting  the  equipment  to  the  expected  body  size,
strength,  and  range  of  motion  characteristics  of  the  user  population.  Such  design  will  also  facilitate  task
performance.
2  Scope
2. 1  The guidelines address safety aspects of ergonomics engineering in the design of semiconductor manufacturing
equipment.    It  should  be  noted  that  in  order  to  ensure  comprehensive  coverage  of  potential  safety  hazards,  some
guidelines also address general design goals for effective human-machine performance.  The guidelines apply to the
design,  operation,  maintenance,  and  service  of  semiconductor  manufacturing  equipment,  as  well  as,  to  a  limited
extent, equipment installation (see ¶7.3).
NOTICE: This safety guideline does not purport to address all of the safety issues associated with its use.  It is the
responsibility of the users of this safety guideline to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  International, national, and local standards, codes, and regulations must be consulted to ensure that equipment
meets regulatory requirements.
3. 2  Human factors data compiled in references and specifications are influenced by the population from which they
were drawn and the reason they were collected. Human factors design criteria are sometimes based on studies using
few  subjects  or  are  context-specific.  Ergonomics  experts  should  be  consulted  where  data  development  or
interpretation is required.


SEMI S8-0705 © SEMI 1995, 2005 2
3. 3  The equipment design should incorporate reasonable accommodations for users with special needs, such as left-
handedness and color blindness.  Where feasible the design should also accommodate users with hearing or vision
impairments  and/or  physical  disabilities.  It  should  be  understood  that  although  designing  for  the  target  user
population  will  accommodate  some  users  with  special  needs,  these  guidelines  cannot  anticipate  and  fully
accommodate all such users.
3. 4  Existing models and subsystems that meet previous versions of SEMI S8 should continue to meet the guidelines
of SEMI S8 in force at the time of design. Models with redesigns that significantly affect the ergonomic design of
the equipment should include conformance to the latest version of SEMI S8 for the redesign.
NOTE 1:  Conformance with this document is believed to be a suitable substitute for conformance with its predecessors.
3. 5  Conformance with the guidelines in Appendix 1 (SESC) constitutes conformance with SEMI S8.

6  General Guidelines
6. 1  Ergonomics-Related  Safety  Issues  —  Ergonomics-related  safety  issues  may  exist  whenever  equipment  design,
installation, operation, service, or maintenance factors result in task demands that exceed the information processing
or physical capabilities of properly trained users. For example, ergonomics-related safety issues may result from:
6. 1.1  Static or awkward postures,
6. 1.2  Repetitive motion,
6. 1.3  Poor access, inadequate clearance, and excessive reach,
6. 1.4  Lifting of heavy or bulky components,
6. 1.5  Displays that are difficult to read or understand,
6. 1.6  Controls that are confusing to operate or require too much force, and
6. 1.7
Use of non-specific warnings or faults to communicate machine problems.
6. 2  Safety-related  issues  should  be  designed  out  or  otherwise  reduced  to  an  acceptable  level  prior  to  production.
Ergonomics-related safety issues are reduced by implementing sound ergonomics engineering principles in design,
and structuring job requirements around human performance capabilities and limitations.
6. 3  Equipment should be designed to reduce or eliminate the potential types of error caused by human-machine or
human-task mismatch (e.g., inadvertent actuation, errors of omission or commission).
6. 4  Engineering controls are the preferred means to reduce hazards. Where an engineering approach to ergonomic
hazard control is not feasible, the user should implement administrative controls to mitigate hazards by reducing the
duration, frequency, or severity of exposure.


SEMI S8-0705 © SEMI 1995, 2005 6
6. 5  Highest  priority  should  be  placed  on  issues  which  have  the  potential  of  resulting  in  injury  to  personnel.
Secondary  priority  should  be  placed  on  issues  which  have  the  potential  of  resulting  in  significant  damage  to
equipment.
6. 6  Information  exchange  between  equipment  suppliers  and  users  regarding  human-machine  interface  issues  is
encouraged  during  the  development  stage,  as  part  of  beta  site  testing,  after  equipment  is  in  full  production,  and
throughout the life cycle of the equipment.
6. 7  Ergonomics  evaluation  should  be  performed  throughout  the  conception,  design,  build,  and  install  phases  to
determine  whether  ergonomics  guidelines  have  been  met.  The  examination  should  yield  a  completed  SESC
document (see Appendix 1).
6. 7.1  Equipment  evaluation  should  identify  risk  factors  associated  with  equipment  design  that  affect  operation,
training, installation, maintenance, or service tasks.
6. 7.2  Use of mock-ups and simulations are beneficial to identify and resolve ergonomic issues before the design is
finalized.  Testing  should  be  performed  with  individuals  who  are  representative  of  the  user  population  under
anticipated working conditions.
6. 7.3  The  evaluation  should  include  consideration  of  multiple  pieces  of  equipment  under  the  control  of  one
individual, resulting in an operation being repeated several times sequentially. The supplier should state the criteria
for this scenario and include it in the report.
6. 8  The overall objective is to provide for equipment effectiveness and for worker safety, convenience, and comfort
when operating and maintaining the equipment.
6. 9  Damage  or  undue  deterioration  of  required  garments  or  PPE  should  not  occur  as  a  result  of  equipment
operation.  Controls, such as knobs and switches, should be designed to be compatible with gloves worn by users for
contamination control or personal protection. For example, cleanroom gloves typically reduce grip strength by 15%.
Equipment  displays  should  consider  the  potential  for  impaired  vision  and  hearing  that  may  occur  with  the  use  of
cleanroom hoods, chemical goggles, or face shields.
6. 10  Technical  documentation  (e.g.,  manuals)  and  on-equipment  instructions  (e.g.,  labels,  indicators  and  screen
menus) should be consistent in action, terminology, symbols, and format.
6. 11  Equipment customized to meet specific customer requirements should not increase the level of ergonomic risk.
6. 12  For recommendations on human interface design, see SEMI E95.
NOTE 2:  SEMI  E95  provides  information  on  human  computer  interface.  It  is  not  the  intent  of  SEMI  S8  to  incorporate  the
requirements of SEMI E95 by reference.
7  Documentation
7. 1  The  supplier  should  provide  an  evaluation  of  the  equipment  to  SEMI  S8  using  Appendix  1,  “Supplier
Ergonomic Success Criteria” for measurable criteria. The evaluation should include a determination of the level of
risk  associated  with  non-conformance  items.  Evaluation  of  risk  should  be  compatible  with  the  SEMI  S10  severity
categories; catastrophic, severe, moderate, and minor.
7. 1.1  For  each  item  in  Appendix  1  which  does  not  meet  the  criteria,  the  evaluation  report  should  include  the
measured  actual  dimensions,  and  state  any  supporting  rationale  for  non-compliance.  Supporting  rationale  may
include test data or documented engineering judgment. EXCEPTION: For Section 1, the manual material handling
analysis, the evaluation report should provide documented calculations regardless of the outcome of the analysis.
7. 1.2  The  evaluation  report  should  also  include  the  following  information:  manufacturer’s  model  number,  serial
number of unit evaluated, date the equipment was evaluated, a list of all tasks which were evaluated as part of the
analysis and the name of the person performing the evaluation.
7. 2  Supplier  provided  documentation  should  include  administrative  controls  intended  by  the  supplier  to  mitigate
ergonomic risks.
7. 3  Supplier  provided  documentation  should  illustrate  any  installation  requirement  necessary  to  meet  SEMI  S8
guidelines  (e.g.,  Diagram  should  show  clearance  area  required  for  opening  hinged  panels,  operator  working  area,
allowable range of vertical foot adjustment to keep ergonomic measurements within SESC acceptable limits, etc.).


SEMI S8-0705 © SEMI 1995, 2005 7
7. 4  The  evaluation  should  specify  an  installation  reference  point  for  each  independently  adjustable  section  of  the
equipment  for  vertical  measures.  If  there  is  a  supplier  recommended  installation  height,  the  reference  for  the
evaluation   should   be   the   same.   This   installation   height   should   be   included   in   the   supplier’s   installation
documentation.
NOTE 3:  Installation  documentation  may  include  installation  manuals  and  other  information  provided  by  supplier  addressing
installation concerns.

APPENDIX 2
LIFTING, STRENGTH, AND MATERIALS HANDLING
NOTICE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  S8  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot
procedures by the North American Regional Standards Committee.
A2-1  General Considerations
A2-1.1  For  recommended  guidelines  regarding  the  percentage  of  a  user's  maximum  grip  strength  to  be  exerted  in
execution of a task see Related Information 1, Table R1-3.
A2-1.2  Where   standard   product   or   containers   are   to   be   handled   at   equipment   load   and   unload   stations,
mechanization  should  be  considered  for  orientation  and  handling.  Where  manual  handling  is  necessary,  the  design
should reduce extended reaching, lifting, pulling, and awkward postures. Simultaneous lifting and twisting should be
avoided.    Load,  unload,  and  lift  over  points  should  be  located  such  that  the  floor  to  hand  height  is  84–107  cm
(33–42 in.), optimal design target is 102 cm (40 in.).
A2-1.3  Handles or cutouts should be designed to facilitate use of the power grip (e.g., similar to that used to hold a
pistol).  Avoid  handles  that  require  pinch  grips  or  awkward  postures.    Handles  should  allow  carrying  close  to  the
body.
A2-1.4  Lifting  and  handling  tasks  performed  in  a  stooping  position  should  be  avoided.  Stooping  occurs  when  the
vertical material handling height is less than 84 cm (33 in.), or the horizontal reach distance is greater than 46 cm
(18 in.) in front of body.
A2-1.5  For two handed push/pull activities the floor to hand height should be between 97 cm (38 in.) and 112 cm
(44 in.).
A2-1.6  Consideration should be given to the standing surface to minimize the risk of slips and falls.
A2-1.7  Awkward   postures   should   be   avoided.   Refer   to   Related   Information   1,   Table   R1-2   for   a   list   of
recommended ranges of awkward postures to avoid.
A2-1.8  For a 2-person handling task, there should be adequate coupling locations and adequate body clearance for
the  activity.  Analyses  need  to  be  performed  and  documented  for  each  person  lifting  if  any  of  the  parameters
(e.g., horizontal reach) are different.
A2-2  Selecting and Using the Appropriate MMH Analysis Tool(s)
A2-2.1  Three  general  MMH  evaluation  tools  are  identified  in  the  following  matrix.    The  three  tools  are  the
“Application  manual  for  the  Revised  NIOSH  Lifting  Equation”  lifting  equation,  biomechanical  models,  and
psychophysical  capacity  tabular  data.    Table  A2-1  was  designed  to  assist  in  determining  which  analysis  tools  are
appropriate for a particular task. For each unique characteristic of the task, a checkmark in the analysis tool column
indicates that the analysis tool is appropriate. If there is any aspect of the task that does not show a check mark in a
particular  tools  column,  that  analysis  tool  is  not  appropriate  to  evaluate  the  task.  Note  that  in  many  situations
multiple tools are appropriate. In situations where the 1991 NIOSH equation is appropriate, the assessor should use
it, because it typically will provide the most conservative results.  In other situations, the assessor may use any of the
appropriate tools.
A2-2.2  Correct application of the 1991 NIOSH equation is described in Waters, Thomas, et. al., Application manual
for  the  Revised  NIOSH  Lifting  Equation,  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (NIOSH),  Cincinnati,
OH, 1994.
A2-2.3  There are many sources of psychophysical data. One such source is A. Mital, A.S. Nicholson, M.M. Ayoub,
A Guide to Manual Materials Handling, Taylor and Francis, London, 1993.
A2-2.4  Biomechanical analysis can be completed using biomechanical modeling software.

R1-2  Neutral and Awkward Postures
R1-2.1  An  important  concept  in  the  field  of  ergonomics  is  the  “neutral  posture”.    A  neutral  posture  is  the  body
position  that  minimizes  stresses  on  the  joints  and  is  the  posture  where  a  person  has  the  greatest  strength  potential.
The  neutral  posture  for  each  joint  is  near  the  middle  of  its  range  of  motion.    Generally,  the  body  in  its  neutral
position is standing erect with the eyes looking forward, and the arms hanging by the sides, as defined by ¶5.2.25.
R1-2.2  Neutral  postures  are  shown  for  standing  and  seated  tasks  in  Table  R1-2.    The  joint  angles  of  these  neutral
postures  are  used  as  the  origin  when  measuring  angular  deviations  of  body  part(s)  to  determine  if  a  posture  is
awkward.
R1-2.3  When  the  body  is  in  a  non-neutral  posture,  potential  strength  and  efficiency  decrease.    Table  R1-3  depicts
selected  awkward  postures.  Angular  deviations  of  the  body  part(s)  from  a  neutral  posture  are  shown  for  the
appropriate joint(s).
R1-2.4  It is not always practicable to design equipment and tasks so that personnel remain in neutral postures.  The
intent of these tables is to show the neutral postures for reference and the awkward postures that, according to the
normative portions of this document (e.g., ¶6.1.1 and ¶A2-1.2) should be avoided.

official  guidelines.  It  was  derived  from  the  work  of  the  originating  task  force.  Publication  was  authorized  by  full
ballot procedures. Determination of the suitability of the material is solely the user’s responsibility.

R2-1  General Considerations
R2-1.1  To  enable  good  system  performance,  equipment  and  workspaces  should  be  designed  to  accommodate  the
physical  dimensions  of  greater  than  90  percent  of  user  population.  For  recommended  anthropometric  data  see
Related Information 1, Table R1-1, Figures R1-1 and R1-2.
R2-1.2  Where  impairment  of  safety  might  result  in  danger  to  life,  such  as  the  inability  to  exit  or  escape  under
emergency conditions, wider percentile ranges should be used (e.g., 1st through 99th percentile range).
R2-1.3  Many anthropometric databases cite unclothed dimensions.
R2-1.4  Critical  and  frequently  used  equipment,  tools,  and  work  items  should  be  placed  in  the  operator’s  primary
viewing area.
R2-1.5  Provision  for  placement  of  required  materials  and  informational  items  used  during  operation  should  be
accommodated  in  the  design.    Examples  of  materials/items  include  product  boxes,  wafer  boxes,  maintenance
manuals, and shop orders.
R2-2  Working Postures
R2-2.1  Workspace configurations that require static or frequent awkward postures (where the limbs or torso deviate
from a neutral position) should be avoided. For ranges of posture to avoid see Related Information 1.
R2-2.2  Equipment  should  be  designed  to  avoid  unsupported  awkward  static  postures  for  operational  tasks  lasting
more than 20 seconds and unsupported awkward static postures for maintenance and service tasks lasting for more
than 40 seconds.
R2-2.3  Where  applicable  to  tasks  performed,  equipment  should  be  designed  to  allow  both  sitting  and  standing
operation.
R2-2.4  Controls,  tools,  and  materials  should  be  located  so  that  the  most  frequent  activities  are  performed  from  a
neutral posture.
R2-2.5  To prevent users from bending at the waist, the design should place users close to the point of operation by
providing  adequate  leg  and  foot  clearance  and  keeping  work  materials  at  an  appropriate  height.  See  the  “Supplier
Ergonomics Success Criteria” in Appendix 1 for design criteria.
R2-3  Standing Workstations
R2-3.1  See the “Supplier Ergonomics Success Criteria” in Appendix 1 for standing workstation design criteria.
R2-3.2  Display  screens  should  be  perpendicular  to  the  normal  line  of  sight  and  the  angle  of  the  screen  should  be
adjustable or positioned to minimize glare.
R2-4  Sitting Workstations
R2-4.1  See the “Supplier Ergonomics Success Criteria” in Appendix 1 for seated workstation design criteria.
R2-4.2  Sit/stand workstations are workstations where the operator can assume a standing posture or a seated posture
using a task stool.

ballot procedures. Determination of the suitability of the material is solely the user’s responsibility.

R3-1  General Considerations
R3-1.1  Equipment design should facilitate rapid and positive fault detection and isolation of defective items.
R3-1.2  Standard  parts  should  be  used  whenever  prac-ticable.  Where  practical,  components  should  be  replace-able
as modular packages and configured for rapid re-moval and replacement (e.g., use of a standard fastener throughout
a design).
R3-1.3  Equipment requiring periodic calibration and adjustment should be readily accessible without disassembly.
R3-1.4  Use of cleanroom gloves reduces maximum allowable grip forces listed in Related Information 1, Table R1-
3 by 15%.
R3-1.5  Use of cotton gloves reduces maximum allowable grip forces listed in Related Information 1, Table R1-3 by
26%.
R3-1.6  Use of chemical protective gloves reduces maximum allowable grip forces listed in Related Information 1,
Table R1-3 by 19%.
R3-1.7  Component design should preclude improper mounting and installation of any component.
R3-1.8  Guides,  tracks,  or  stops  should  be  provided  as  necessary  to  facilitate  handling  and  prevent  damage  to
equipment or injury to personnel.
R3-1.9  Refer  to  ANSI/IES  “Practice  for  Industrial  Lighting”  for  recommended  illumination  based  on  task
characteristics.
R3-1.10  Structural   members   or   permanently   installed   equipment   should   not   visually   or   physically   prevent
adjustment, servicing, removal of replaceable equipment, or other required maintenance tasks.
R3-1.11  Items  which  require  rapid  or  frequent  maintenance  should  be  most  accessible.  Predicted  or  known  high
failure-rate items should be accessible for replacement with minimal removal of nearby or adjacent non-failed items.
If  it  is  necessary  to  remove  non-failed  items,  then  the  total  ergonomic  impact  must  be  assessed  to  determine
conformance.
R3-1.12  Sufficient space should be provided for the use of standard test equipment and required maintenance tools
without difficulty or hazard. Self-checking or built-in test features are recommended.
R3-2  Cables, Connectors, Plugs, Receptacles, and Circuit Boards
R3-2.1  Connectors which may need to be disconnected and reinstalled during the life of the tool that are mounted in
close proximity should have clearance so that each one can be easily removed and reinstalled.
R3-3  Equipment Enclosures
R3-3.1  Equipment enclosures should be easily removable or sufficiently larger than the item they cover to facilitate
installation and removal of components.
R3-3.2  Cover or shield holes should be large enough for fastener clearance without precise alignment.
R3-3.2.1  Access openings should be designed to permit unobstructed physical and visual operation. Size and shape
of the access should allow for easy passage of equipment and body parts of a 95th percentile North American male
with necessary PPE and tools, as appropriate.
R3-3.2.2  Unless  prohibited  from  a  microcontamination  standpoint,  access  covers  should  be  hinged  or  sliding.  Lift
off covers will require manual material handling analysis.


SEMI S8-0705 © SEMI 1995, 2005 33
R3-3.3  The  number  and  diversity  of  fasteners  used  should  be  minimized.  Fasteners  requiring  non-standard  tools
should be avoided, except where access is to be restricted.
R3-3.3.1  Hinges,  tongue-and-slot  catches,  and  mounting  pins  should  be  used  to  minimize  the  number  of  fasteners
required. Pin and hook arrangements are preferred to hinges for contamination control.
R3-3.3.2  Captive fasteners should be used where dropping or loss of such items could cause damage to equipment
or  create  difficult  or  hazardous  removal.  Captive  fasteners  should  also  be  provided  for  access  covers  requiring
frequent removal.
R3-3.3.3  Fasteners  should  require  the  minimum  number  of  turns  compatible  with  mechanical  stress,  alignment,
positioning,  and  load  considerations.  Items  requiring  removal  for  daily  or  more  frequent  inspection  and  servicing
should use quick release fasteners.

R4-1  Hazard Alerts
R4-1.1  Potential  hazards  to  the  user,  equipment,  or  product  should  be  identified  and  documented.    An  evaluation
should be made as to the appropriate method(s) of alert, alert content, and location.  More than one method of hazard
alert may be necessary.  Refer to SEMI S1.
R4-1.2  Hazard  alerts  should  be  consistent  with  information  provided  in  operator  and  maintenance  manuals  and
other training information materials.
R4-1.3  Hazard alerts can be provided by labels, signs, placards, visual alerts, auditory alarms, status indicators, or
hazard alert systems integral with the equipment’s operating system (e.g., displayed through the video display).
R4-1.4  Hazard  alerts  and  fault  messages  should  be  specific  and  communicate  the  consequences  of  engaging
hazards.
R4-2  Labels
R4-2.1  Hazard alert labels should be located such that they are readily visible to the intended viewer and alert the
viewer to the potential hazard in time to take appropriate action.
R4-3  Audible Alarms
R4-3.1  To  avoid  noise  pollution,  alarms  should  be  reserved  for  situations  requiring  immediate  intervention  to
prevent personal injury, equipment damage, process disruption, or product damage.
R4-3.2  Alarm  design  should  take  into  account  impairments  that  may  be  caused  by  clothing  and  hearing  and  eye
protection.
R4-3.3  Users  should  be  provided  with  an  input  device  for  acknowledging  and  canceling  alarms  without  erasing
information  that  accompanies  the  alarm.    The  capability  to  cancel  alarms  should  be  evaluated  for  its  impact  on
safety.
R4-3.4  Alarm  decibel  levels  will  require  a  setpoint  above  the  background  noise  levels  sufficient  to  meet  local
regulations.

R5-1.1  The  selection  and/or  design  of  controls  and  displays  should  be  based  on  careful  analysis  of  equipment
functionality requirements. This will determine what information the operator needs to make appropriate decisions
and responses, thus reducing potential design-induced error.
R5-1.2  Potential  errors  due  to  inattention,  stress,  fatigue,  sensory  overload,  etc.,  need  to  be  considered  during
system design.  This can be accomplished by ensuring that critical controls and displays attract the user’s attention
and that controls and displays are clearly labeled and arranged to reduce confusion. Whenever possible, functionally
related controls and displays should be grouped together.
R5-1.3  Appropriate feedback should be provided for system status, mode of operation, operator input actions, and
equipment malfunctions.
R5-1.4  Controls and displays should be clearly labeled/identified by function. Controls and displays can be coded
by  color,  size,  shape,  or  location  to  help  discriminate  between  functions  and  identify  critical  information.  Colors
should be in accordance with NFPA 79 and EN 60204-1.
R5-1.5  Placement  of  labels  should  be  consistent  on  pieces  of  equipment  (e.g.,  either  below  or  above  controls  and
displays).
R5-1.6  To  accommodate  color  blind  users,  color  should  be  supplemental  to  other  means  of  coding  such  as  icons,
words, flashing, shape, etc.
R5-2  Controls
R5-2.1  In general, the design of controls should consider the following criteria:
R5-2.2  Control  movement  or  activation  should  be  compatible  with  users’  expectations  and  provide  positive
evidence  that  an  input  has  been  accepted  or  that  control  action  is  being  accomplished.  Feedback  can  be  visual,
auditory, tactile, or a combination thereof.
R5-2.3  Controls should be designed and located to minimize awkward postures.
R5-2.4  Controls should be designed, positioned, or protected to prevent inadvertent actuation.
R5-2.5  The maximum width of frequently used control panels should be 68.6 cm (27 in.).
R5-2.6  Controls  should  be  located  away  from  chemical,  thermal,  radiation,  electrical,  or  mechanical  hazards.  If
such a location cannot be avoided, controls should be appropriately shielded and labeled.
R5-2.7  Control force requirements should be designed in accordance with HumanScale, NFPA 79, EN 60204-1, or
another recognized standard.
R5-3  Visual Displays
R5-3.1  The type of visual display selected should depend on the nature of information conveyed and conditions of
use. The effectiveness and utility of a visual display generally depends on visibility, legibility, and meaningfulness.
R5-3.2  Further information may be found in MIL-STD-1472 for non-VDT displays, and ISO 9241 for VDTs.
R5-3.3  The visibility of a display is determined by the viewing distance, the size of the display, the location, angle
of view, local illumination characteristics, obstructions, or reflections.
R5-3.4  Critical and frequently used displays should be placed in the operator’s primary viewing area.


SEMI S8-0705 © SEMI 1995, 2005 36
R5-3.5  The display should be positioned so the user has a clear line of sight. Displays should not be located where
they are obstructed (by controls, equipment, body parts, etc.) or subject to glare. Display viewing should not require
awkward body postures.
R5-3.6  The  legibility  of  a  display  is  determined  primarily  by  its  visual  angle  and  luminance  contrast  with  the
background.
R5-3.7  There  should  be  sufficient  contrast  between  the  object,  letters,  or  numbers  on  a  display  to  separate  them
from the background, minimum ratio 3:1, preferred is 7:1 (ISO 9241). Too much contrast may result in glare.
R5-3.8  The  ability  of  displayed  information  to  communicate  with  the  user  clearly  and  precisely  depends  on  the
amount of information displayed.  Display design should emphasize simplicity and usability to:
R5-3.8.1  Reduce error and decrease response time.
R5-3.8.2  Provide only the amount of information necessary and only at a level of precision required.
R5-3.8.3  Display content in a directly usable form with no transformation required.
R5-4  Auditory Displays
R5-4.1  Auditory coding or signals may be used to alert a user to critical conditions or operations. Auditory coding
should be supplementary to visual coding.  Auditory displays can be used effectively when:
R5-4.1.1  Vision is overburdened or degraded,
R5-4.1.2  The message requires immediate action,
R5-4.1.3  The job requires the operator or maintainer to move around frequently,
R5-4.1.4  The message is simple and short,
R5-4.1.5  The message signals an event in time, or
R5-4.1.6  The message does not need to be referred to later.
R5-5  Control - Display Relationships
R5-5.1  The  relationship  between  associated  controls  and  displays  (their  organization  and  layout)  is  critical  to
optimizing system performance and minimizing operator error.
R5-5.2  Controls  and  displays  should  be  organized  into  functional  groups  and  positioned  according  to  criticality,
sequence of operation, and frequency of use.
R5-5.3  Control-display compatibility refers to the extent to which the relationship between a control operation and
its  effect  is  predictable  by  the  user.  Predictability  is  determined  by  individual  and  population  cultural  stereotypes
(user expectations, previous experience, an idea of the way equipment works, etc.). Lack of compatibility degrades
speed,  accuracy  of  performance,  and  increases  probability  of  error.    Types  of  compatibility  include  sequential
arrangement,  spatial  organization,  and  direction  of  movement.  Technology  transfer  and  utilization  by  a  multi-
cultural or multi-ethnic work force, as well as across global user populations should consider the impact of cultural
and behavioral stereotypes.
R5-5.4  Display layout, control location, and operation should be similar throughout a particular type and/or model
of equipment or system.  Consistency is particularly important for color, shape, and size of controls, scale markings
on displays, and labeling.

USER COMPUTER INTERFACE
NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI S8 and is not intended to modify or supersede the
official  guidelines.  It  was  derived  from  the  work  of  the  originating  task  force.  Publication  was  authorized  by  full
ballot procedures. Determination of the suitability of the material is solely the user’s responsibility.

R6-1  Operator Interaction
NOTE R6-1: Refer to ISO 9241 for detailed guidance.
R6-1.1  The dialogue should be suitable for the task.
NOTE R6-2: A dialogue is suitable for a task when it supports the user in the effective and efficient completion of the task.
R6-1.1.1  The dialogue should present the user only with information related to the completion of the task.
R6-1.1.2  The  information  displayed  should  be  in  a  directly  usable  form  to  avoid  the  need  to  transpose,  compute,
interpolate, or translate.
R6-1.1.3  Help information should be task dependent.
R6-1.1.4  Any actions that can appropriately be allocated to the interface software for automatic execution should be
carried out by the software without user involvement.
R6-1.1.5  When designing the dialogue, consideration should be given to the complexity of the task with respect to
the users’ skills and abilities.
R6-1.1.6  The format of input and output should be appropriate to the given task and user requirements.
R6-1.1.7  The dialogue should support the user when performing recurrent tasks.
R6-1.1.8  If default input capabilities exist for a given task (e.g., standard default values) it should not be necessary
for  the  user  to  input  such  values.  It  should  also  be  possible  to  replace  default  values  with  other  values  or  other
appropriate default values.
R6-1.1.9  During performance of a task in which data is changed, the original data should remain accessible if the
task requires it.
R6-1.1.10  The dialogue should avoid forcing unnecessary task steps.
R6-1.2  The dialog should be self-descriptive.
NOTE R6-3: A dialogue is self-descriptive when each dialogue step is immediately comprehensible through feedback from the
system or is explained to the user on request.
R6-1.2.1  After  any  user  action,  the  dialogue  should  provide  feedback,  where  appropriate.  If  severe  consequences
result from the user action, the system should provide explanation and request confirmation before carrying out the
action.
R6-1.2.2  Feedback  or  explanations  should  be  presented  in  consistent  terminology,  which  is  derived  from  the  task
environment, rather than from the dialogue system technology (e.g., when the user wants to input an order to load a
cassette, LOAD should be the command rather than a code followed by pressing the ENTER key).
R6-1.2.3  Feedback or explanations should assist the user in gaining a general understanding of the dialogue system
as a possible supplement to user training.
R6-1.2.4  Feedback  or  explanations  should  be  based  on  the  level  of  knowledge  which  the  typical  user  may  be
expected to have.
R6-1.2.5  Feedback or explanations varying in types and length, based on user needs and characteristics, should be
available for the user.
R6-1.2.6  To  enhance  their  value  for  the  user,  feedback  or  explanations  should  strictly  relate  to  the  situation  for
which they are needed.


SEMI S8-0705 © SEMI 1995, 2005 38
R6-1.2.7  The  quality  of  feedback  or  explanations  should  minimize  the  need  to  consult  user  manuals  and  other
external information, thus avoiding frequent media switches.
R6-1.2.8  If defaults exist for a given task they should be made available to the user.
R6-1.2.9  The user should be informed about changes in the dialog system status that are relevant to the task.
R6-1.2.10  When  input  is  requested,  the  dialogue  system  should  give  information  to  the  user  about  the  expected
input.
R6-1.2.11  The  requirement  to  learn  special  program  codes,  long  sequences,  and  special  instructions  should  be
avoided.
R6-1.3  The dialogue should be controllable.
NOTE R6-4: A dialogue is controllable when the user is able to initiate and control the direction and pace of the interaction until
the point at which the goal has been met
R6-1.3.1  The speed of interaction should not be dictated by the operation of the system. It should always be under
the control of the user according to the user's needs and characteristics.
R6-1.3.2  The  dialogues  should  give  the  user  control  over  how  to  continue  with  the  dialogue.    Exceptions  may  be
made  for  critical  alarms,  fault  situations,  as  well  as  process  and  safety  reasons.    User  interrupt  or  abort  options  to
terminate interactions should be provided.
R6-1.3.3  If the dialogue has been interrupted, the user should have the ability to determine the point of restart when
the dialogue is resumed, if the task permits.
R6-1.3.4  If  interactions  are  reversible  and  the  task  permits,  it  should  be  possible  to  undo  at  least  the  last  dialogue
step.
R6-1.3.5  Different user needs and characteristics require different levels and methods of interaction.
R6-1.3.6  The way that input/output data are represented (format and type) should be under the control of the user.
R6-1.3.7  Where alternative input/output devices exist, the user should have the option of which one to use.
R6-1.4  The dialogue should conform with user expectations.
NOTE R6-5: A dialogue conforms with user expectations when it is consistent and corresponds to the user characteristics, such
as task knowledge, education, experience, and to commonly accepted conventions.
R6-1.4.1  Dialogue behavior and appearance within a dialogue system should be consistent.
R6-1.4.2  State change actions should be implemented consistently.
R6-1.4.3  Dialogues  used  for  similar  tasks  should  be  similar  so  that  the  user  can  develop  common  task  solving
procedures.
R6-1.4.4  Immediate  feedback  on  user  input  should  be  given  where  appropriate  to  user  expectations.  It  should  be
based on the level of knowledge of the user.
R6-1.4.5  The cursor should be located where the input is wanted.
R6-1.4.6  If  a  response  time  is  likely  to  deviate  considerably  from  the  expected  response  time,

the  user  should  be
informed of this.
R6-1.5  The dialogue should be error tolerant.
NOTE R6-6: A dialogue is error tolerant if, despite evident errors in input,

the intended result may be achieved with either no or
minimal corrective action by the user.
R6-1.5.1  The  application  should  assist  the  user  in  detecting  and  avoiding  errors  in  input.    The  dialogue  system
should prevent any user input from causing undefined dialogue system states or dialogue system failures.
R6-1.5.2  Errors should be explained to help the user to correct them.
R6-1.5.3  Depending  on  the  task,  it  may  be  desirable  to  apply  special  effort  in  presentation  techniques  to  improve
the recognition of error situations and their subsequent recovery.


SEMI S8-0705 © SEMI 1995, 2005 39
R6-1.5.4  In cases where the dialogue system is able to correct errors automatically, it should advise the user of the
execution of the corrections and provide the opportunity to override the corrections.
R6-1.5.5  User  needs  and  characteristics  may  require  that  error  situations  are  deferred,  leaving  the  decision  to  the
user when to handle them.
R6-1.5.6  Additional explanations should be provided during error correction on request.
R6-1.5.7  Validation/verification of data should take place before attempting to process the input.
R6-1.5.8  Additional controls should be provided for commands with serious consequences.
R6-1.5.9  Error correction should be possible without switching dialogue system states, where the task permits.
R6-1.6  The dialogue should be capable of individualization.
NOTE  R6-7:  A  dialogue  is  capable  of  individualization  when  the  interface  software  can  be  modified  to  suit  the  task  needs,
individual preferences, and skills of the user.
NOTE R6-8: Although, in many cases, providing users with customization capabilities is very desirable, it is not an acceptable
substitute  for  ergonomically  designed  dialogues.  In  addition,  customization  capabilities  should  be  provided  only  within  certain
limits  such  that  modifications  cannot  cause  users  any  potential  discomfort  (e.g.,  unacceptable  noise  levels  with  user  configured
auditory feedback).
R6-1.6.1  Mechanisms  should  be  provided  to  allow  the  dialogue  system  to  be  adapted  to  the  user's  language  and
culture, individual knowledge and experience of task domain, perceptual, sensory-motor, and cognitive abilities.
R6-1.6.2  The  amount  of  explanation  (e.g.,  details  in  error  messages,  help  information)  should  be  modifiable
according to the level of knowledge of the user.
R6-1.6.3  The user should be allowed to incorporate their own vocabulary to establish individual naming for objects
and actions if it suits the contexts and tasks. It should also be possible for the user to add individualized commands.
R6-1.6.4  The user should be able to set up operational time parameters to match their individual needs.
R6-1.6.5  Users should be able to choose between different dialogue techniques for different tasks.
R6-1.6.6  Log  in  should  be  a  separate  procedure  that  is  completed  before  a  user  may  select  an  operational  step.
Passwords should be used to protect (limit access to) parts of the operating system which may be beyond the user’s
skill level to control safely.
R6-1.7  The dialogue should be suitable for learning.
NOTE R6-9: A dialogue is suitable for learning when it supports and guides the user in learning to use the system.
R6-1.7.1  Rules and underlying concepts which are useful should be made available to the users, thus allowing the
users to build up their own grouping strategies and rules for memorizing activities.
R6-1.7.2  Relevant  learning  strategies,  (e.g.,  comprehension  oriented,  learning  by  doing,  learning  by  example)
should be provided.
R6-1.7.3  Relearning facilities should be supported.
R6-1.7.4  A  number  of  different  means  to  help  the  user  to  become  familiar  with  the  dialogue  elements  should  be
provided.
R6-2  Video Display Terminals
NOTE R6-10: Refer to ISO 9241 and EN 894-2 for detailed guidelines.
R6-2.1  Display  characteristics  should  be  selected  to  suit  the  specific  conditions  of  use.  For  example,  the  expected
viewing  distance,  ambient  levels  of  illumination,  and  lighting  color  (e.g.,  yellow  illumination)  in  the  work  area
should be considered.
R6-2.2  Displays  should  be  perpendicular  to  the  user’s  normal  line  of  sight.  The  angle  of  the  screen  should  be
adjustable or positioned to minimize glare.
R6-2.3  Surfaces immediately adjacent to the display should have a matte finish to control glare.


SEMI S8-0705 © SEMI 1995, 2005 40
R6-2.4  Areas coded by luminance only should differ in display luminance with respect to each other by ratio of at
least 1.5:1.
R6-2.5  Where  blink  coding  is  used  solely  to  attract  attention,  a  single  blink  frequency  of  1Hz  to  5Hz  with  a  duty
cycle  of  50%  is  recommended.  Where  readability  is  required  during  blinking,  a  single  blink  rate  of  1/3Hz  to  1Hz
with a duty cycle of 70% is recommended. It should be possible to switch off the blinking of the cursor.
R6-2.6  The  number  of  colors  simultaneously  presented  on  a  display  should  be  based  on  the  performance
requirements  of  the  task.  In  general,  the  number  of  colors  simultaneously  presented  should  be  minimized.  For
accurate identification, the default color set(s) should consist of no more than eleven colors in each set.
R6-3  Input Devices
NOTE R6-11: Refer to ISO 9241 and EN 894-3 for detailed guidelines.
R6-3.1  Input  characteristics  should  be  selected  to  suit  the  specific  conditions  of  use.  For  example,  the  performed
task,  workstation  arrangement,  ambient  levels  of  illumination  in  the  work  area,  and  related  tasks  should  be
considered.
R6-3.2  Keyboards  should  permit  easy  repositioning  on  the  work  surface.  Other  than  for  special  applications  with
clearly defined tasks, the keyboard should be detachable. The keyboard should be stable during use (i.e., it should
not slip or rock).
R6-3.3  Keyboard  support  surfaces  should  be  adjustable  to  accommodate  standing  or  seated  operation  where
suitable.

5. 0 NOTE A:  Some machines process wafers horizontally. 150–200mm
wafers are normally carried vertically, so to load these
machines, the operator must rotate the wafer cassette to
orient the wafers for processing.
NOTE B:  Manual rotation of wafer cassettes can increase stress on the
machine operator’s upper extremities, which may lead to
physical strain over time and/or damage to wafers, especially
if the wafer cassettes do not have handles.
NOTE C:  Manual and powered wafer cassette rotation devices are a
way to provide controlled rotation of wafer cassettes as a
means to reduce the machine operator’s physical stress and
lower the potential for wafer damage.

6. 0 (Handle dimensions are correct for use of bare hand or use of typical
cleanroom gloves).
NOTE A:  A recommended practice for selecting a handle design is to
first determine the force requirements before choosing a
handle design that is best suited for the intended forces,
motions and environment.  Handle design recommendations
for various hand forces and handgrips are located in ¶¶6.2–
6. 6.
NOTE B:  Handles should anticipate the use of gloved hands.
