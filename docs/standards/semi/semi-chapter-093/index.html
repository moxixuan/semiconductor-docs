5  Terminology
5. 1  General Terminology
5. 1.1  Definition of Backlight Unit
5. 1.1.1    Backlight  unit  (BLU)  is  a  kind  of  light  source
positioned at the backside of liquid crystal panel. Since
LCD is non-emissive display device it needs essentially
light source.
5. 1.2  Structure of BLU
5. 1.2.1        As    an    initial    light    source    cold    cathode
fluorescence  lamp  (CCFL)  is  used  at  bottom  and/or
topside   of   BLU.   The   light   emitted   from   CCFL   is
entered  into  light  guide  plate  (LGP).  Here  light  is
spread  out  two-dimensional  light  by  scattering  sites  at
the   back   surface   LGP   or   inside   of   LGP.   Two-
dimensional  light  is  sometimes  diffused  by  diffusion
sheet  or  conversed  by  prism  sheet  respectively.  And
final light comes into human eyes.</p><p>g

6  Related Definitions for Mura Measurement
6. 1  Mura is a Japanese term meaning blemish and has been adopted in English to provide a name for imperfections
of  the  display  pixel  matrix  surfaces  that  are  visible  when  the  display  is  in  operation.  Inspect  the  display  surface
while  displaying  a  white  full  screen,  a  black  full  screen,  and  a  dark  gray  full  screen  (VESA  FPDM  2.0).  In  many
case, the Mura phenomena is detected by human eyes. But this is very confusing in the quality aspect. And it is very
difficult to quantify the level.
6. 2  The definition in SEMI D31 shows mainly that Luminance Mura is related with the size of Mura. Therefore this
standard will follow the Cjnd concept.
6. 3  Semu Definition
6. 3.1  Under specific conditions, the below regression function can explain the level of Mura between the area and
contrast for Human Mura JND.  (Refer to SEMI D31.)
Cjnd  = F (Sjnd) = 1.97/Sjnd

it indicates that as Mura the area gets smaller, only darker Mura can be sensed.</li><li>3.2.1  For the subject Mura, the Mura level, Semu, can be calculated using the below formula.
Semu     = |Cx| / Cjnd

7. 2  Measurement Method
7. 2.1  Warm-Up Time
7. 2.1.1  Warm-up  time  is  the  period  from  power-on  to  saturation  of  the  light  intensity.  The  optical  measurement
needs 15 to 30 minutes for more accurate measurement. In case of Mura, it has a little luminance difference between
the luminance of Mura and the luminance of background the area. Therefore it must be measured in a saturate state.</p><p>Figure 1
General Warm-Up Characteristics</p><ol start="7"><li>2.2  Light Measurement Device (LMD)</li><li>2.2.1  When  human  eyes  measure  the  FPD,  it  is  detected  in  the  total  active  area.  So  the  measuring  equipments
must  have  similar  characteristics  to  the  human  eye  detecting  method.  In  this  standard,  we  recommend  the  CCD
equipments to detect the Mura phenomena.
1) Dynamic Range — The dynamic range of the CCD equipment should be over 12 bits because the Semu value
must be controlled by 0.1 Semu.
2) Luminance  Accuracy  —  The  Accuracy  of  Luminance  is  very  important  to  measure  Mura,  because  the  Mura
value is determined by low luminance difference. Therefore the accuracy of luminance should be ±0.01 cd/m
2</li></ol><p>at the 100cd/m
2
.
3) Measuring  Points  —  The  measuring  points  should  be  over  200(H)  X  200(V)  points.  It  is  the  same  as  the
number of the CCD sensors.
7. 2.3  Test Pattern for Semu Measurement
7. 2.3.1  The test pattern should be set by 50 cd/m
2
in the white pattern. The permissible error is 10 cd/m

7. 2.5.1  Because we use a CCD Camera, the measuring distance is set by the same angle in all DUT. We standardize
the 15′′ display size and testing distance is 500 mm. But the testing distance should be different from each display
size.

If  some  threshold  values  are  different  from each  test
equipment,  the  Semu  test  results  are  different.  Therefore  we  use  the  Cx  value  to  determine  the  threshold  value.  In
this standard, when the Cx value is over 1.01, we can consider the Mura area.</li><li>2.7  Area Calculation Method</li><li>2.7.1  There are two main parameters for calculating the Semu value. The first one is the Cx value and the other is
the Sx value. The Sx value means that the surface area of Mura being measured. We can calculate the size of Mura
area with counting the number of pixels under the CCD equipment test.</li><li>2.8  Test Sample Pattern for the Sample Test</li><li>2.8.1  Originally,  the  test  pattern  should  be  set  by  50  cd/m

pattern has 10 Muras in Figure 3. Each Mura has a different gray level. In Figure 3, the left one shows darker Mura
patterns, and the right one shows brighter Mura patterns.</li></ol><p>Figure 3

SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES
IMPORTANT NOTICE: This specification is incomplete. The incomplete sections are noted as “To Be Determined.”
The  Gases  Committee  has  agreed  to  publish  this  section  prior  to  completion  as  a  service  to  the  Semiconductor
Industry.
This specification was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility of
the North American Gases Committee.  Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards
Committee  on  February  28,  1999.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  April  1999;  to  be  published  June</p><h1>1999</h1><ol start="1999"><li>Originally published in 1986; previously published in 1995.
1  Preface</li><li>1  Recognizing the importance of  impurity content of
gases  in  the  manufacture  of  semiconductors,  suppliers
responded   by   introducing   products   with   improved
analytical characterization, notably for trace impurities.</li><li>2   The  SEMI  Gases  Committee  b e gan  its  efforts  in
the    spring    of    1979.    With    this    publication,    the
Committee     establishes     the     definitions,     general
procedures,  specifications,  and  analytical  procedures
for the gases listed in the index.</li><li>3   Products  which  meet  all  of  the   requirements  may
be described as “meeting SEMI specifications.”</li><li>4   Where  an  analytical  procedure   different  from  that
provided is substituted by a supplier or user, the burden
of  proof  is  on  said  supplier  or  user  to  confirm  the
equivalency. It should be noted that the following list of
criteria  was  considered  when  determining  the  specified
analytical method.
Reliability
Ease of Use
Maintenance
Precision
Accuracy
Sensitivity
Versatility
Availability of Equipment</li><li>5    The   specifications   provided   by    this   work   are
intended   to   serve   for   gases   to   be   used   in   the
manufacture   and   processing   of   semiconductors   and
advanced    electronic    devices    and    circuits.    The
specifications  and  the  associated  test  procedures  are
guidelines  based  on  the  experience  of  suppliers  and
users.  The  function  of  the  specifications  is  to  establish
desired standards of quality.</li><li>6  Where feasible, a specification  of content shall be
expressed as a numerical limit in units of mole per mole
(mole/mole).</li><li>7  For a major component, the va lue (assay or purity)
shall be expressed as a minimum permissible limit. For
an impurity, the value shall be expressed as a maximum
permissible limit.</li><li>8    A   gas   conforming   to   the   specif ications   will
commonly  contain  more  of  the  major  component  than
the  minimum  permissible  limit  or  contain  less  of  an
impurity  (or  several  impurities)  than  the  SEMI  C3
maximum  permissible  limit.  In  neither  case  shall  the
gas be considered as of higher quality than that defined
by the specification.</li><li>9   It  is  not  practical  to  consider  e very  impurity  or
contaminant    that    might    be    present.    For    certain
applications,  it  is  recognized  that  more  stringent  or
additional   specifications   and   procedures   might   be
required.  The  intent  of  these  specifications  and  the
associated  procedures  is,  on  one  hand,  to  assure  that  a
gas is suitable for the common uses to which it may be
put in the manufacture and processing of semiconductor
devices  and,  on  the  other  hand,  to  be  consistent  with
contemporary manufacturing processes for that gas.</li><li>10     The    Committee    is    continuing    w ork    on
improvement   of   specifications   and   procedures   and
addition  of  other  gases  and  systems  such  as  mixed
gases.      The      Committee      welcomes      comments,
suggestions, and recommendations.

procedures.
4. 2  Sampling Procedures
4. 2.1  Cryogenic Liquid Sample — L iquid Samples for
Oxygen,  Nitrogen,  and  Argon,  using  the  TTU-131/E
sampler.
WARNING:  DO  NOT  USE  THIS  PROCEDURE
FOR THE SAMPLING OF LIQUID HYDROGEN.
4. 2.2   Applicable  Document  —  Milit ary  Specification
MIL-S-27626D  16  August  1979,  Amendment  1,  24
April 1981.
4. 2.3     General    Description    —    The    T TU-131/E
cryogenic  sampler  is  a  small,  portable  pressure  vessel
used  to  receive,  vaporize,  and  contain  a  representative
sample  of  cryogenic  liquid  from  a  supply  source.  The
vaporized  sample  is  withdrawn  as  a  gas  for  analytical
purposes.
4. 2.4  Theory — The sampler is used  to isolate a small
but   representative   quantity   of   cryogenic   liquid   and
vaporize    the    major    component    and    all    volatile
impurities  to  form  a  homogeneous  gas  sample  suitable
for  analysis.  The  cryogenic  liquid  is  used  to  cool  a
shielding space and sampling cup prior to admitting the
liquid  to  the  sampling  cup.  The  purpose  of  pre-cooling
the  sampling  cup  is  to  prevent  concentrating  impurities
which could result when the warm cup causes the liquid
to   vaporize,   leaving   behind   impurities   with   higher
boiling points.
4. 2.4.1    When   the   cup   is   adequately   co oled,   the
sampling  valve  is  opened,  allowing  liquid  to  fill  the
cup.  When  the  sampling  valve  is  closed,  the  liquid  is
trapped  in  the  cup  and  will  vaporize  as  a  result  of
atmospheric  heating.  Once  the  sample  is  trapped,  the
flow of liquid is stopped.
4. 2.5  Preparation for Sampling
4. 2.5.1  The sample should be kept in t he same product
service  to  avoid  sample  contamination.  If  a  product
change   is   required,   always   thoroughly   purge   the
sampler  or  evacuate  to  100  microns  prior  to  taking  the
sample.
4. 2.5.2   When  taking  the  sample,  the  s ampler  is  to
remain  secured  to  the  bottom  half  of  the  case  and
MUST be in an upright position.</p><p>SEMI C3-0699 © SEMI 1986, 19995
4. 2.5.3   Inspect  the  sampler  vessel  for   any  obvious
physical  defects,  such  as  dents,  gouges,  bent  fittings,
etc. Since the sampler is a pressurized vessel, it should
be removed from service if any damage is apparent.
4. 2.6  Sampling Procedure
4. 2.6.1  Remove cover.
4. 2.6.2    Loosen   inlet   and   outlet   fittings    dust   caps
located on side of the vessel.
CAUTION:         SAFETY         GLASSES         AND

SHOULD      BE      DONE      ONLY      IN      WELL
VENTILATED AREAS.
4. 2.6.3   Relieve  pressure  in  vessel  thro ugh  vents  in
dust caps by cautiously opening inlet sampling valve.
4. 2.6.4   When  gauge  indicates  atmosph eric  pressure
and flow ceases, close inlet sampling valve and remove
dust caps.
4. 2.6.5   Connect  fill  hose  to  supply  tan k  and  inlet
fittings of sampler.
4. 2.6.6   Open  supply  tank  outlet  valve.   Gas  and  liquid
will begin to flow from the sampler outlet.
CAUTION:    WHEN    OXYGEN    IS    SAMPLED,
SOME  ADDITIONAL  PRECAUTIONS  MUST  BE
OBSERVED.  IF  THERE  IS  NO  FACILITY  SUCH
AS A CLEAN CONCRETE PAD ON WHICH THE
LIQUID  OXYGEN  CAN  EVAPORATE  SAFELY,
IT   WILL   BE   NECESSARY   TO   CATCH   THE
LIQUID  OXYGEN  IN  A  CLEAN,  PREFERABLY
SEAMLESS  ALUMINUM  BUCKET.  USE  A  LINE
WITH  MINIMUM  INSIDE  DIAMETER  OF  ONE-
HALF INCH TO DIRECT THE LIQUID OXYGEN
INTO   THE   BUCKET.   FURTHERMORE,   IT   IS
IMPORTANT        THAT        THERE        IS        NO
RESTRICTION  IN  THIS  LINE  BECAUSE  THE
BACK    PRESSURE    DEVELOPED    MAY    BE
SUFFICIENT  TO  CAUSE  THE  LIQUID  IN  THE
CUP    TO    OVERFLOW    INTO    THE    LARGE
CHAMBER.  ON  WARMUP,  THE  PRESSURE  IN
THE  SAMPLER  COULD  BECOME  EXCESSIVE,
PARTICULARLY    IF    THE    SAMPLE    WERE
SUBCOOLED,           NECESSITATING           THE
REPLACEMENT    OF    THE    SAFETY    RELIEF
DEVICE.
4. 2.6.7   Allow  sampler  to  cool  until  a  s teady  flow  of
liquid appears at outlet.
CAUTION:    AVOID    CONTACT    WITH    THE
FLOW      OF      CRYOGENIC      LIQUID.      THE
EXTREMELY     LOW     TEMPERATURE     CAN
CAUSE PAINFUL INJURIES.

6  Gas Chromatography
6. 1   The  analysis  of  many  gaseous   impurities  in  bulk
and   specialty   gases   is   done   by   means   of   a   gas
chromatography  separation  of  impurities  from  the  gas
matrix   and   quantification   using   a   broad   range   of
sensitive   and   sometimes   selective   detectors.   This
section   will   provide   a   guide   for   the   format   and
representation of such a procedure. Figure 1 is designed
to   represent   the   format   for   submission   of   such
methodology.
6. 2    Sample   Introduction   —   By   its    nature,   gas
chromatography  implies  the  use  of  carrier  gases  into
which  the  gaseous  sample  is  injected  and  carried  into
the  separation  medium,  either  solid  or  liquid  in  nature.</p><p>SEMI C3-0699 © SEMI 1986, 19996
The introduction of a gaseous sample into a carrier gas
stream is accomplished by means of a sample injection
valve.  Valves  for  this  purpose  can  be  any  of  several
types,  although  the  most  commonly  used  are  either
rotary or diaphragm valves using loops of stainless steel
tubing  of  a  known  volume.  It  is  not  necessary  to
diagram   such   sample   introduction   systems   for   a
procedure  unless  the  introduction  system  is  unique  to
the  application  by  way  of  special  conditions  for  safety
or other reasons critical to the accuracy of the sampling
technique.
6. 3   Separations  —  It  is  an  accepta ble  and  common
practice  to  quantitate  several  gaseous  impurities  with  a
single  gas  chromatographic  separation.  Occasionally  a
single     injected     sample     volume     will     undergo
&quot;multidimensional&quot;  separation  to  achieve  the  necessary
analysis.  Rotary  valves,  diaphragm  valves  or  Dean&#x27;s
pressure  switching  again  are  used  to  move  impurities
from  one  separation  medium  to  another,  or  from  one
column to another. Where multidimensional techniques
are  used,  they  should  be  accompanied  by  flowpath
diagrams   which   clearly   indicate   valving   and   their
appropriate   positions.   The   valving   sequences   used
should   have   adequate   explanation   to   clarify   the
separations.
6. 4   Columns  —  Columns  used  are   generally  of  3.2
mm  (1/8  in.)  o.d.  and  2.2  mm  (0.085  in.)  i.d.  stainless
steel  of  varying  lengths  and  packed  with  one  of  many
solid supports. Columns may be specified by length and
packing  material  if  these  standard  dimensions  apply.  If
another  dimension  or  material  is  used  for  the  column
itself,  it  should  be  specified  by  material  type,  and  by
o.d.   and   i.d.   in   mm.   Packing   materials   should   be
specified  by  material,  %  coating  and  coating  type  if
applicable,   and   mesh   size.   Capillary   columns   are
assumed  to  be  fused  silica  unless  otherwise  specified
and should be specified by i.d. in mm, film thickness in
μm,  and  length  in  meters.  Column  temperatures  and
applicable  program  rates  should  be  given  for  each
independently heated zone in degrees Celsius.
6. 5  Carrier and Support Gases —  Carrier and support
gas  flow  rates  for  all  separations  should  be  specified.
Carrier  and  support  gases  used  should  fall  into  the
general  purity  requirements  in  Table  2  and  purity  need
not  be  specified  unless  the  analysis  has  specific  purity
requirements    for    safety,    accuracy,    or    component
lifetime.   Flows   should   be   specified   in   mL/min   or
L/min,  or  as  linear  velocity  for  open  tubular  capillary
columns.
6. 6    Detectors   —   Detector   technolo gy   should   be
specified,  and  alternative  detection  may  be  assumed
equivalent    for    detectors    of    like    selectivity    and
sensitivity.      Table   2   gives   a   reference   of   relative
detector sensitivity and is provided as a guideline only.
Detector   parameters   are   less   likely   to   be   easily
formatted  since  detector  technologies  vary  widely  in
their   specific   parameters.   All   elements   critical   to
achieving  like  sensitivity  must  be  included,  such  as
temperature,  make-up  gases  and  their  flows,  flame,
combustion  or  reaction  gas  ratios  or  flows,  voltages,
currents,  or  any  additional  settings  as  outlined  by  the
detector manufacturer.
6. 6.1   Detection  limits  must  be  speci fied  for  each
impurity  for  the  actual  methodology  used.  Because  the
lower   detection   limit   can   be   greatly   influenced   by
retention  time  for  any  impurity,  it  is  important  that  the
detection  limit  be  derived  for  the  impurity  within  the
context   of   the   method,   and   not   solely   on   the
detectability   of   the   detector.   Detection   limits   are
assumed to be calculated on a mole/mole basis.
6. 7   Operating  Procedures  —  The   standard  procedure
assumed  for  the  gas  chromatographic  analysis  of  most
gases is as follows:</p><h1>1</h1><ol><li>Inject  the  calibration  standard  onto  the  column
using  a  gas  sampling  valve.  Record  the  retention
time(s) and peak area(s) for all impurities detected.</li></ol><h1>2</h1><ol start="2"><li>Analyze   the   sample   to   be   tested   in   the   same
manner as the calibration standard.</li></ol><h1>3</h1><ol start="3"><li>Repeat 1.</li></ol><h1>4</h1><ol start="4"><li>Compare  the  average  peak  area  of  the  calibration
standard with that of the sample being tested. (See
Calculation of Concentration, in Section 6.9.)</li><li>7.1  The method should specify an y additional valve
switching or special parameters which are necessary for
the  successful  analysis  of  the  impurities  specified  for
the  procedure.  It  must  also  specify  the  order  of  elution
if multiple impurities are detected.</li><li>8   Calibration  —   Calibration  for   these  analytical
procedures   is   generally   by   external,   single   point
calibration.    Calibration    gas    mixtures    should    be
specified   and   are   assumed   to   be   within   the   range
specified  in  Section  2.26.  Calibration  standards  are
assumed  to  be  made  in  a  balance  of  gas  representative
of  the  sample  unless  otherwise  specified.  If  calibration
techniques  other  than  external,  point  calibrations  are
used, they must be described.</li><li>9  Calculation of Concentration —  The calculation of
the concentration of impurity within the sample is based
on  a  comparison  of  the  average  peak  area  of  the
impurity in the calibration standard, to the average peak
area  of  the  impurity  within  the  sample,  based  on  the
formula:
Sample Peak Area
Standard Peak Area
×
Concentratio
n<h1>of Standard</h1>Concentratio
n
of Sample</li></ol><p>SEMI C3-0699 © SEMI 1986, 19997
It is assumed that the results of such a calculation must
not   exceed   the   specification   for   the   product   being
analyzed.

7  Special Analyses</li><li>1  Resistivity Measurement — Th e American Society
of   Testing   and   Materials   (ASTM)   is   developing   a
method   to   measure   resistivity   in   substrates.   This
method may be referenced when it is finalized.</li><li>2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds</li><li>2.1   Because  of  the  importance  of  t race  elemental
impurities   impacting   silicon   device   characteristics,
there   is   an   increasing   need   for   the   detection   and
quantitative   analysis   of   low-level   impurities   in   the
silicon  materials  used  in  device  fabrication.  Some  of
these     materials     are     gaseous     silicon-containing
compounds,  such  as  silane  and  the  chlorosilanes.  For
elemental  analysis  by  FTIR  or  PLS,  a  compound  must
first  be  converted  to  a  solid  form  such  as  a  single
crystalline     rod     or     disc.     For     the     quantitative
determination    of    metals    and    some    non-metallic
elements,  the  gases  can  be  passed  through  a  series  of
bubblers   containing   high-purity   DI   water   or   dilute
acids.  The  aqueous  media  can  be  concentrated  and
analyzed  by  suitable  techniques  such  as  ICP  or  AA
spectroscopy. In both cases, the recovery is assumed to
be 100% efficient or, in other words, there is no loss of
any impurity from the silicon source.</li><li>2.2        FTIR       (Fourier       Transform       Infra red)
Spectroscopy,  PLS  (Photoluminescence  Spectroscopy)
and  NAA  (Neutron  Activation  Analysis)  are  probably
the  most  useful  tools  for  the  detection  and  analysis  of
trace  quantities  of  elemental  impurities  in  solid  silicon
materials.    NAA    requires    special    silicon    material
specimens  to  be  submitted  to  neutron  irradiation  in  a
nuclear reactor and the analysis facility to be approved
by  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  and
other  government  agencies.  In  contrast,  FTIR  and  PLS
do not require special governmental regulations, and the
instrumentation is available on the open market.</li><li>2.3     An    FTIR    spectrometer    is    an    in frared
spectrometer  in  which  a  Michelson  Interferometer  is
used  in  place  of  a  grating  or  prism.  The  simplicity  of
the  Michelson  Interferometer,  with  only  one  moving
part, an oscillating mirror, along with a He-Ne laser as a
reference, provides nearly absolute frequency accuracy.
This translates into a high spectral resolution. FTIR has
greater  detection  efficiency  since  the  energy-wasting
slits required for dispersive spectrometers are not used.
With  a  microcomputer  to  control  the  functions  and  to
perform  data  processing,  signal  averaging  is  used  to
improve the signal-to-noise ratio. All these features lead
to  good  reproducibility  and  rapid  measurement  results
compared with conventional IR techniques.</li><li>2.3.1  As FTIR is a transmission met hod, it requires a
single  crystalline  silicon  specimen  with  flat,  parallel,
mirror-polished  surfaces.  For  oxygen  in  silicon,  the
absorption  peak  at  9  microns  is  used  for  quantitative
analyses.  For  carbon  in  silicon,  the  absorption  band  at
16   microns   is   used.   Both   measurements   may   be
performed     at     room     temperature.     (The     carbon
determination  has  strong  interference  from  the  silicon
phonon  band,  but  can  be  resolved  with  high  purity,
carbon-free    standards.)    For    the    determination    of
shallow   donors   and   acceptors,   FTIR   measurements
must  be  made  at  liquid  helium  temperatures,  but  the
through-put  is  low.  Although  the  operation  of  today&#x27;s
FTIR  instrument  is  relatively  simple,  the  interpretation
of    the    results    through    software    and    associated
problems/solutions is not. Quantitative analysis is based
upon    the    measured    percent    transmission    at    the
characteristic  wavelength  and  compared  to  standards.
Detection limits at about 10-12°K are in the 10
11
to 10
13
atoms/cc  for  shallow  donors  and  acceptors,  3.1  ×  10
14
atoms/cc for oxygen, and 2 × 10
15
atoms/cc for carbon.</li></ol><p>SEMI C3-0699 © SEMI 1986, 19998

7. 2.4     Photoluminescence    Spectrosco p y    (PLS)    of
single  crystalline  silicon  specimens  at  liquid  helium
temperatures  exhibits  sharp  emission  lines.  Electron
hole   pairs   called   excitons   are   formed   by   incident
radiation  (514.5  nm  line  from  argon  laser).  The  decay
of  these  “exciton  or  multi-exciton”  states  yields  the
lines characteristic of the impurity atoms. For elemental
detection, the observed emission lines must be assigned
as being extrinsic (due to impurities) or intrinsic (due to
silicon).  The  luminescence  process  itself  appears  too
complex  to  attain  precision  or  accuracy  from  basic
calculations.  The  PLS  emissions  are  analyzed  as  a
function  of  wavelength,  suggested  to  be  1077  to  1139
nm,  for  the  elemental  determination  of  shallow  donors
and  acceptors  in  silicon.  Quantitative  measurements  of
impurities    are    based    on    the    extrinsic-to-intrinsic
intensity  ratio  and  compared  to  standards.  The  PLS
emissions  are  analyzed  using  a  monochromator  and
detected  by  a  photomultiplier.  Sensitivity  in  the  range
of 5 × 10
10
to 5 × 10
11
atoms/cc has been claimed for B,
Al, P, and As.
7. 2.4.1   In  order  to  obtain  reliable  mea surements,  the
silicon  specimens  must  be  in  single  crystalline  form
with a mirrored surface. Epitaxial wafers with layers of
thickness greater than 10 microns are suitable, since the
sample&#x27;s  depth  appears  to  be  less  than  5  microns.
However,  it  is  still  in  the  development  stage,  and  very
few  laboratories  have  such  capability.  A  number  of
questions remain unanswered, including the following:</p><ol><li>What is the effect of compensating impurities?</li></ol></blockquote><p>SEMI C3-0699 © SEMI 1986, 199910
2. What  is  the  effect  of  deep  levels  and  intracenter
transitions on the intensity ratios?
3. What  is  the  effect  of  crystallographic  defects?  Of
point defects? And of surface defects?
4. Interference  from  other  shallow  impurities  may
mask  the  detection  of  very  low-level  impurities.
For  instance,  PLS  signal  of  Al  at  1078.5  nm  may
be affected by strong signals from As at 1079.0 nm
or at 1078.2 nm.
7. 2.4.2  CVD-deposited films in single  crystalline form
can  be  used  for  elemental  detection  of  donors  and
acceptors  for  gaseous  silicon  compounds.  However,
PLS  does  not  detect  carbon,  oxygen,  or  nitrogen.  It  is
also   not   useful   for   metallic   impurities.   That   is,   in
general, PLS is useful only for a very limited number of
impurities.
7. 2.5  Based on this analysis, it was r ecommended that
the  SEMI  Gases  Analytical  Procedures  Subcommittee
should  wait  for  further  development  of  innovative  and
improved   analytical   techniques   for   the   quantitative
determination  of  low-level  elemental  impurities  based
on FTIR and PLS. Meanwhile, techniques such as ICP,
AA,  and  Ion  Chromatography  may  be  applicable  to  a
very large number of impurities of interest to the silicon
semiconductor industry. Development and adaptation of
these technologies should be encouraged.
7. 2.6   AA  (Atomic  Absorption  Spect rophotometry),
ICP      (Inductively      Coupled      Plasma      Emission
Spectrometry),   and   IC   (Ion   Chromatography)   are
probably the most valuable instrumental techniques for
the detection and analysis of trace elemental impurities
in aqueous media. These techniques usually require that
the  elements  be  dissolved  in  an  aqueous  medium.  Due
to  this  fact,  and  the  fact  that  the  elemental  impurities
are  typically  present  in  silane  and  the  chlorosilanes  at
the   ppb   and   sub-ppb   levels   (which   is   beyond   the
detection limits for these techniques for most elements)
it  is  usually  necessary  to  concentrate  the  impurities
prior  to  analysis,  such  as  by  passing  the  gas  through  a
series of impingers (i.e., gas bubblers) containing either
DI  water  or,  more  commonly,  acidic  solutions.  From
analyses   of   the   impinger   solutions   together   with
knowledge concerning impinger solution volume(s) and
both  the  flow  rate  and  period  of  flow  of  the  gas,  the
concentration of the respective elements in the original
gas should be readily calculated to a fairly high degree
of accuracy.
7. 2.6.1   Atomic  Absorption  Spectroph otometry  can  be
used for elemental analyses for a multitude of elements
in  the  periodic  table  at  detection  limits  ranging  from
ppm to ppb, depending both on the exact configuration
or setup and the element being analyzed. The principle
of  the  technique  involves  conversion  of  an  incoming
aerosol  into  an  atomic  vapor  which  can  absorb  light
from  a  primary  light  source,  usually  a  hollow  cathode
lamp  or  an  electrodeless  discharge  lamp  (EDL),  the
latter    providing    improved    sensitivity    and    lower
detection  limits  for  certain  elements.  In  addition,  a
flameless (i.e., graphite furnace) technique can be used
to  increase  sensitivities  and  detection  limits  50  to  100
times better.
7. 2.6.2   Complementary  to  Atomic  Ab sorption  Spec-
trophotometry  is  Flame  Emission  Spectrophotometry,
which  differs  in  the  absence  of  a  primary  light  source.
Again,   a   flame   is   utilized   to   convert   an   incoming
aerosol  into  an  atomic  vapor.  However,  the  flame  also
thermally  elevates  the  atoms  to  an  excited  electronic
state,  and,  when  the  atoms  return  to  the  ground  state,
they  emit  light  detectable  by  a  photomultiplier.  This
technique  is  ideal  for  the  analysis  of  Li,  Ha,  and  K  at
ppm and sub-ppm levels.
7. 2.6.3      Inductively     Coupled     Plasma     E mission
Spectrometry    (ICP)    is    rapidly    replacing    Atomic
Absorption  Spectrophotometry  for  elemental  analyses
of  liquids,  since  approximately  70%  of  the  elements  in
the   periodic   table   can   be   determined   with   better
precision  and  equal  or  better  sensitivity  with  minimal
sample  preparation.  Detection  limits,  in  fact,  for  this
technique range from ppm to sub-ppb levels, depending
both  on  instrumental  and/or  experimental  conditions
and    the    element    being    analyzed.    ICP    involves
nebulizing  liquid  samples  either  directly  or  in  diluted
form into a spray chamber where a stream of argon gas
carries   the   smaller   sample   droplets   into   the   axial
channel of an argon plasma which reaches temperatures
of  4000-8000°K.  The  common  technique  employs  an
optical   system   for   detection.   Newer   techniques   are
being  investigated  using  a  mass  spectrometer  as  a
detection  system  coupled  to  an  ICP  excitation  source.
This is referred to as ICP/MS.
7. 2.6.4  Ion Chromatography (IC) uses  the principle of
ion exchange to separate anionic and cationic species at
detection  limits  ranging  from  ppm  to  ppb,  depending
again   both   on   the   instrumental   and   experimental
conditions and on the element being analyzed.
7. 2.6.5    Detection   of   ionic   species   in   IC    is   most
commonly  accomplished  by  an  electrical  conductivity
detector   capable   of   measuring   most   non-transition
metal   cations   and   anions   to   sub-ppm   levels.   An
electrochemical  detector  (for  amperometric  detection)
is  available  for  measuring  any  electroactive  species
having an oxidation/reduction potential near the applied
electrochemical  cell  potential.  This  latter  detector  is
capable  of  measuring  many  ionic  species  at  ppb  levels
(e.g., Br
–
, CN
–
, S
–
, etc.).</p><p>SEMI C3-0699 © SEMI 1986, 199911
7. 2.6.6    Of   the   three   aforementioned   te chniques,
Atomic   Absorption   Spectrophotometry,   Inductively
Coupled   Plasma   Emission   Spectrometry,   and   Ion
Chromatography,    the    most    sensitive    method    of
analyzing for a multitude of elements is, without doubt,
graphite  furnace  (i.e.,  flameless)  Atomic  Absorption
Spectrophotometry.      However,      this      instrumental
technique  suffers  the  disadvantage  of  being  slow  and
tedious.   Consequently,   Inductively   Coupled   Plasma
Emission   Spectrometry   is   rapidly   replacing   Atomic
Absorption  Spectrophotometry  for  elemental  analyses
of   liquids   since   it   is   a   reasonably   fast   technique
requiring  minimal  sample  preparation  with  practical
detection limits being superior to those of standard (i.e.,
flame) Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry for most
elements  and  approaching  those  of  graphite  furnace
Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry for many of the
elements.  An  added  attractive  feature  of  Inductively
Coupled    Plasma    Emission    Spectrometry    is    that
eventually  it  may  be  used  to  analyze  for  elements
directly in gases. Preliminary work, in fact, is currently
being conducted in this area by several research groups.
Although  Ion  Chromatography  can  be  used  to  analyze</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-a-multitude-of-non">for a multitude of non<a href="#for-a-multitude-of-non" class="hash-link" aria-label="for a multitude of non的直接链接" title="for a multitude of non的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>transition metal cations (e.g., Li</p><ul><li>,

limited  by  the  fact  that  currently  only  a  few  transition

etc.) can be analyzed by this instrumental technique. IC,
however,  has  the  advantage  in  that  it  can  be  used  for
analyzing  for  complex  cationic  and  especially  anionic
species  directly  (e.g.,  NH

oxidation  states  for  certain  elements  (e.g.,  Fe
+2
and
Fe

),  unlike  the  other  techniques,  which  are  strictly
limited  to  elemental  analyses  only.  Furthermore,  IC  is
extremely    valuable    for    analyzing    ionic    species,
particularly anions (e.g., F</li><li>, Cl</li><li>, etc.) of many common
elements  which  otherwise  cannot  be  analyzed  directly
by   either   Atomic   Absorption   Spectrophotometry   or
Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometry.

NOTE  3:  Introduce  the  calibration  standard  as  many  times  as
necessary to achieve the desired precision.
NOTE  4:  All  the  gases  used  in  the  analysis  of  the  sample

4. 1.5.3  Set timing interval #3 to 4:20 minutes.
4. 1.5.4    Do  not  change  the  initial  sample  flow  setting
once established.
4. 1.5.5    Obtain  a  continuous  flow  of  the  calibration
standard using a clean stainless steel line (0.02 in. ID).
4. 1.5.6        Inject    the    calibration    standard    onto    the
precolumn  with  the  gas  sampling  valve.  Record  the
retention  times  and  peak  areas.  Order  of  elution  is
nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon monoxide.
4. 1.5.7    Repeat  Section  4.1.5.6  until  reproducibility  of

in  ammonia.
The  sample  should  be  gas  phase  and  analyzed  using  a
gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector.
NOTE  7:  It  is  good  practice  to  keep  carrier  gas  flowing
through  the  instrument.  This  prevents  the  back-diffusion  of
moisture and carbon dioxide in the air from contaminating the
column.
NOTE   8:   When   not   analyzing   samples,   the   dual   column
switching  valve  should  be  set  at  the  molecular  sieve  position
to prevent the silica gel column from drying out.
NOTE  9:  The  silica  gel  column  will,  after  repeated  use,  tend
to  dry  out.  This  will  manifest  itself  by  the  peaks  of  each
component   becoming   separated   farther   and   farther   apart.
Overall sensitivity will drop as the peak areas decrease due to
the peaks spreading out more and more.
NOTE  10:  The  condition  of  the  silica  gel  column  is  restored
by allowing the carrier gas to pass through the water-saturated
silica  gel  trap  that  has  been  provided.  (Normally  the  carrier
gas bypasses this trap.)
NOTE 11: The flame should be extinguished when not in use;
also  the  air  and  hydrogen  is  shut  off;  and  the  helium  flow

Cleaning  of  lines,  flow  meters  and  valves  shall  be  completed
before a new cylinder has to be analyzed and shall be repeated
after  10  samplings,  or  if  a  new  cylinder  has  to  analyzed.  The
impingers  must  be  rinsed  with  water  after  each  sampling.
Before  a  new  cylinder  has  to  be  analyzed  and  after  five
samplings,  the  impingers  must  be  cleaned  using  the  above

Detection Limits
7. 5.2  Instrument Parameters — Operate the designated
analytical  instruments  according  to  the  manufacturer’s
instructions.
7. 5.3
Sampling Procedure
7. 5.3.1  Clean   all   metallic   and   plastic   components
according to the procedures described in Notes 6 and 7.
Use 18 MΩcm water.
7. 5.3.2
Connect    all    components    of    the    sampling
system.
NOTE 9: The  apparatus  is  charged  with  sufficient  water  to
just  cover  the  rim  of  the  funnel  (approximately  100  ml).    A
magnetic stirrer is introduced and the apparatus closed.
7. 5.3.3  Connect  the  sampling  system  to  the  sample
boron trichloride cylinder (see Note 8).
7. 5.3.4
Purge   with   filtered   argon   (&lt;   0.01   μ)   at
approximately   1   L/min.   for   15   minutes   prior   to
sampling.  During this period, the apparatus is inclined
so  as  to  allow  a  higher  flow  rate  without  excessive
agitation of the water.
NOTE 10: Due  to  the  design  of  the  apparatus,  suck-back
should  be  prevented,  but  this  must  be  guarded  against.  A
bubble rate of about one per second should be set.
7. 5.3.5  While    observing    the    sampling    apparatus,
operate  the  needle  valve  to  admit  sample  slowly  to  the
sampling apparatus. Initial absorption will be fast.
7. 5.3.6
The  sample  flow  is  halted  when  no  further
absorption  seems  to  be  taking  place  (i.e.,  when  bubble
rate increases at the vent).
7. 5.3.7
The  argon  purge  is  re-established  for  a  further
15 minutes.
7. 5.3.8
The   apparatus   is   allowed   to   cool   and   the
contents    quantitatively    transferred    to    a    250    ml
polypropylene flask.
NOTE 11: The  solution  prepared  above  will  contain  some
crystals of boric acid which have come out of solution during
cooling.  For  the  purpose  of  analysis,  the  concentration  of
boric acid must be reduced. Also the amount of BCl
3
samples
need to be determined.
7. 5.3.9  A 5 ml aliquot of the solution is titrated against
1  M  NaOH  using  methyl  red  as  an  indicator.    The
quantity   of   sample   boron   trichloride   taken   is   then
calculated.
7. 5.3.10
A  sample  of  the  solution  is  diluted  ×  10  with
water.  The aliquot is taken from the supernatant liquid.
7. 5.3.11
Analysis  is  carried  out  in  a  suitable  analyzer
capable  of  meeting  the  required  detection  limits.  A
blank   solution   of   1%   hydrochloric   acid   is   used.
Yttrium is used as an internal standard at a level of 0.2
ppm added to all analysis solutions.
7. 5.3.12
Calibration curves are prepared using standard
solutions  covering  the  elements  required.  Traceable
standards    can    be    obtained    from    national    and
international bodies.
7. 5.3.13
Calculate  the  concentration  of  iron  and  nickel
content  using  the  calibration  curve  and  the  volume  of
boron trichloride sampled.</p><p>SEMI C3.51-1101 © SEMI 1995, 20015

8. 1.2  Reagents
8. 1.2.1  Distilled-water ice, cracked.
8. 1.2.2  Nitrogen, dry; 35 ppm water, or less.
8. 1.3  Operating       Procedure       -       Water-Insoluble
Components
CAUTION: Perform all work in a hood.
8. 1.3.1  Prepare the gas-collecting tube by washing with
distilled  water,  rinsing  with  acetone,  then  drying  in  an
air  oven  at  100ñ125∞C.  Flush  with  dry  nitrogen  for
about one minute. Leave filled with dry nitrogen; close
the stopcocks.
8. 1.3.2  Connect the needle valve assembly apparatus to
the cylinder to be tested.
8. 1.3.3      Attach   the   gas-collecting   tube   to   the   valve
nipple with a short piece of dry Tygon tubing.
8. 1.3.4  Open the cylinder valve, open the gas collecting
tube   stopcocks,   and   very   carefully   crack   open   the
needle valve.
8. 1.3.5  Purge the tube for 5 minutes with a slow stream
of BF
3
gas.
8. 1.3.6  Close the needle valve, close the gas-collecting
tube stopcocks, and then close the cylinder valve.
8. 1.3.7    Proceed  with  the  analysis,  after  removing  the
gas-collecting tube from the valve nipple.
8. 1.4  Operating      Procedure      -      Water      Soluble
Components
CAUTION: Perform all work in a hood.
8. 1.4.1  Before attaching the Tygon delivery tube, purge
the  sampling  valve  system  for  1  minute  with  a  slow
stream  of  boron  trifluoride  from  the  cylinder.    Use  a
separate piece of tubing when purging.
8. 1.4.2    Weigh  an  empty  1-L  polyethylene  bottle  with
cap to the nearest 0.01 g. Record this weight as A.
8. 1.4.3    Fill  the  bottle  with  about  400  g  of  cracked,
distilled-water  ice.  Re-weigh  the  bottle  with  cap  to  the
nearest 0.01 g; record as weight B.
8. 1.4.4  A sampling line is used to transfer BF
3
gas from
the cylinder to the sample bottle.
8. 1.4.5      Connect   the   Tygon   delivery   tube   from   the
sampling valve apparatus to the trap. Support the Tygon
tubing  from  the  trap  outlet;  then  open  the  needle  valve
and adjust until a steady flow of BF
3
is obtained.  Insert
this   Tygon   tubing   (from   the   trap   outlet)   into   the
polyethylene   sample   bottle,   extending   down   to   the
bottom  of  the  bottle.  Carefully  introduce  the  BF
3
into
the  ice  until  most  of  the  ice  is  melted,  then  close  the
needle valve and remove the Tygon tubing. Remove the
sample  bottle  and  cap  it.  Re-weigh  the  bottle,  cap  and
contents to the nearest 0.01 g. Record this weight as C.
8. 1.4.6  Mix thoroughly by careful inversion until all of
the  ice  melts,  being  certain  to  keep  the  plastic  bottle
tightly capped so that none of the liquid is lost.
8. 1.4.7  Proceed with the determination of water-soluble
components,  being  sure  to  do  the  sulfur  dioxide  first,
since  opening  the  bottle  repeatedly  may  result  in  a
considerable loss of sulfur dioxide.

8. 2.5  Procedure
8. 2.5.1      Obtain   the   sample   of   BF
3
gas   in   the   gas
collecting tube. See Section 8.1.3 for sampling details.
8. 2.5.2    Fill  the  separatory  funnel  with  sodium  chloride
solution. Attach Tygon tubing and a pinch clamp to the
funnel.
8. 2.5.3      With   a   small   dropper,   fill   the   glass   tubing
leading  to  the  stopcock  opposite  the  calibrated  end  of
the gas collecting tube with the salt solution. (Note: the
gas collecting tube is inverted at this point.)
8. 2.5.4    Open  the  separatory  funnel  stopcock  and  the
pinch  clamp  on  the  Tygon  tubing.  Hold  the  tubing
upright and when it completely fills with NaCl solution,
slip  the  tubing  onto  the  end  of  the  gas  collecting  tube
which was previously filled in step 8.2.5.3.
NOTE  1:  There  should  be  no  air  bubbles  in  the  connections
between  the  gas  collecting  tube  and  the  separatory  funnel.  A
trace  of  a  wetting  agent  such  as  Ultrawet  (Atlantic  Refining
Co.)  in  the  salt  solution  assists  in  freeing  small  air  bubbles
from the walls of connecting tubes.
8. 2.5.5    Hold  the  gas  collecting  tube  vertical,  with  the
calibrated  end  up  and  the  entire  collecting  tube  below
the liquid level of the separatory funnel.
8. 2.5.6    Open  the  lower  stopcock  of  the  gas  collecting
tube carefully and shake the tube to aid in dissolving of
the BF
3
gas in the salt solution.
8. 2.5.7  Bring the liquid level in the gas collecting tube
equal to the liquid level in the separatory funnel.
8. 2.5.8  Read and record the volume of undissolved gas
in  the  upper  calibrated  end  of  the  gas  collecting  tube
and  record  this  volume,  to  the  nearest  one-tenth  of  a
milliliter; mL = F. Record the room temperature.
8. 2.6  Calculations
8. 2.6.1    F  =  Total  milliliters  of  undissolved  gas  (from
Section 8.2.5.8).
8. 2.6.2  E = Total volume of gas collecting tube in mL;
