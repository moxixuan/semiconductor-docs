Note that these specifications were originated in the United States.  Care should be taken in applying this configuration to specific applications
(see ¶6.6.3).
#2
For referee purposes, metric (SI) units apply.  To ensure that product shipped is within specification, any conversion to U.S. Customary
equivalents should be done following the maximum-minimum convention in which the minimum values are rounded-up and the maximum values
are rounded-down to ensure that the equivalent range is always inside the referee range.  If U.S. Customary equivalents are used for incoming
inspection, minimum values should be rounded-down and maximum values rounded-up to avoid rejection of material that is within the
specification when measured by the referee system of units.  CAUTION: The significance of the rightmost digit may vary, depending on the
quantity being measured and the precision of the test procedure. Refer to the relevant test method for precision data which can be used to
construct appropriate guard bands.

If  specified  as  polished,  this  term  is  meant  to  imply  a  surface  condition  and  not  a  particular  processing  technique.    If  desired,  a  quantitative
measure of surface finish may optionally be indicated by specifying the rms microroughness over a specified spatial frequency (or wavelength)
range.  Because a standardized test method has not yet been developed for this metric, both values and test procedures, including sampling plan
and detrending procedures, shall be agreed upon between supplier and customer.

Note that these specifications were originated in the United States.  Care should be taken in applying this configuration to specific applications
(see ¶6.6.3).  The specification for 300 mm wafers is essentially equivalent to the specification for wafers of this diameter in JEITA EM-3602.
#2
For referee purposes, metric (SI) units apply.  To ensure that product shipped is within specification, any conversion to U.S. Customary
equivalents should be done following the maximum-minimum convention in which the minimum values are rounded-up and the maximum values
are rounded-down to ensure that the equivalent range is always inside the referee range.  If U.S. Customary equivalents are used for incoming
inspection, minimum values should be rounded-down and maximum values rounded-up to avoid rejection of material that is within the

If specified as polished, this term is meant to imply a surface condition and not a particular processing technique.  If desired, a quantitative
measure of surface finish may optionally be indicated by specifying the rms microroughness over a specified spatial frequency (or wavelength)
range.  Because a standardized test method has not yet been developed for this metric, both values and test procedures, including sampling plan
and detrending procedures, shall be agreed upon between supplier and customer.
#7
Gloss as measured in accordance with ASTM Test Method D 523 or JIS Z 8741 with visible illumination at a 60° angle of incidence referenced
to a mirror polished silicon wafer front surface.  This metric may not describe the back surface finish adequately to establish detectability of small
localized light scatterers (LLSs).  If it is necessary to detect LLSs smaller than 0.25 μm LSE, another quantitative measure of surface finish may
optionally be indicated by specifying the rms microroughness over a specified spatial frequency (or wavelength) range.  Because a standardized
test method has not yet been developed for this metric, both values and test procedures shall be agreed upon between supplier and customer.


SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 31
6. 6.3  Shape  —  The  shape  decision  tree  in  Appendix  2  fully  describes  the  various  shape  parameters  that  can  be
specified.
6. 6.3.1  Warp is generally the most often specified shape parameter.  Only wafers of category 1.1 (2 in. diameter) do
not  have  a  warp  specification.    Note  that  there  are  two  forms  of  warp,  one  corrected  for  gravitational  sag  and  the
other not so corrected.
6. 6.3.2   If  bow  is  specified,  a  sign  may  be  included  in  the  specification  to  denote  convex  (positive)  or  concave
(negative)  curvature  of  the  median  surface  of  the  wafer  with  the  front  surface  up.    If  no  sign  is  included  in  the
specification, bow may vary between -a and +a, where “a” is the specified maximum magnitude of bow.
6. 6.3.3  Sori is an attribute that may be specified with agreement between the supplier and customer in lieu of or in
addition to bow and/or warp.
6. 6.4  Standard  Wafer  Categories  —  The  standardized  dimensions,  dimensional  tolerances,  and  fiducial  (flat  or
notch) characteristics for various standard wafer categories are summarized in Tables 4 through 9.  These categories
of  wafers  shall  meet  all  requirements  listed  in  the  appropriate  table,  unless  an  exception  is  negotiated  between
supplier and customer and is shown on the purchase order.
6. 6.4.1  Wafers of the same nominal diameter may typically have different dimensional configurations in different
regions of the world.  Many of these configurations are represented in these tables.  In selecting the appropriate
standard polished wafer category, consideration should be given to compatibility with processes and equipment
generally available in the region of use.
6. 6.5  Flatness —  The  wafers  shall  meet  global  and  site  flatness  requirements  as  specified  in  the  purchase  order.
Details of different flatness parameters are given in Appendix 1.
6. 6.6  Nanotopography — The wafers shall meet nanotopography requirements specified in the purchase order.
6. 7  Front Surface Chemistry
6. 7.1  If surface metal contamination levels are specified on the purchase order, the maximum area densities shall be
designated in units of atoms/cm
2
for specific individual elements together with the measurement method by which
the densities are to be determined.  The wafers shall not contain more than the specified density of each metal.
NOTE 3:  An example of such a specification applicable to 1 μm geometries is given in Related Information 1.
6. 7.2  If surface organic contamination levels are specified on the purchase order, the maximum area densities shall
be designated in units of ng/cm
2
for total surface organics density together with the method by which the density is
to be determined.  The wafers shall not contain more than the specified density of total surface organics.
6. 8  Front and Back Surface Inspection Characteristics
6. 8.1  The wafers shall conform to the limits on observable (visually or otherwise) front and back surface
characteristics as specified on the purchase order.
6. 8.2  For wafers of diameter 150 mm or smaller for which visual inspection of surface defects is acceptable, the
defect limits in Table 10 may be used as a guide for determining acceptable defect levels.  Under these
circumstances, minimal conditions or dimensions for surface features to be considered as defects are stated below.
These limits shall be used for determining wafer acceptability; anomalies smaller than these limits shall not be
considered defects.
6. 8.2.1  Item 2-8.1, scratches, macro — Any anomaly conforming to the definition that has a length-to-width ratio
greater than 5:1 and is visible under diffuse illumination as well as under high intensity illumination.
6. 8.2.2 Item 2-8.2, scratches, micro — Any anomaly conforming to the definition that has a length-to-width ratio
greater than 5:1 and is visible only under high intensity illumination.
6. 8.2.3  Item 2-8.3, pits — Any individually distinguishable nonremovable surface anomaly conforming to the
definition that is visible when viewed under intense illumination.
6. 8.2.4  Item 2-8.4, haze — Haze is indicated when the image of a narrow beam tungsten lamp filament is detectable
on the polished wafer surface.  Under some conditions, contamination may appear as haze.

Individual  process  median  capability  for  each  of  the  following  metal  contaminants:  Al,  Ca,  Cr,  Cu,  Fe,  K,  Na,  Ni,  and  Zn.    Due  to  high
measurement variability, data are recorded for process capability and not for individual shipment quality reports.
7. 2   Effective  implementation  of  the  basic  specification  concept  requires  the  standardization  of  many  wafer
characteristics that have not historically been specified in a SEMI standard, as well as some characteristics that have
historically  been  specified  in  SEMI  standards,  but  have  been  routinely  modified  as  a  customer  preference.    The
resulting  variety  of  customer  specifications  causes  silicon  suppliers  to  install  additional  processes  and  metrics,  or
different  processes  and  technologies  for  satisfying  individual  specifications.    To  realize  the  full  benefits  of  a  basic
specification, it is essential that all parameters be accepted without additional options.
7. 3 Wafers  produced  to  this  specification  shall  be  qualified  through  routine  process  checks,  demonstrating  the
process is in state of control.  Verification of the process and quality control shall be provided on a shipment basis
through a certification that does not require the inclusion of data specifically from that shipment.

8 Sampling
8. 1  Unless otherwise specified, ASTM Practice E 122 shall be used to define the sampling plan.  When so specified,
appropriate  sample  sizes  shall  be  selected  from  each  lot  in  accordance  with  ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4.    Each  quality
characteristic shall be assigned an acceptable quality level (AQL) or lot tolerance percent defective (LTPD) value in
accordance  with  ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4  definitions  for  critical,  major,  and  minor  classifications.    If  desired  and  so
specified  in  the  contract  or  order,  each  of  these  classifications  may  alternatively  be  assigned  cumulative  AQL  or
LTPD values.  Inspection levels shall be agreed upon between the supplier and the purchaser.
9  Test Methods
9. 1   Measurements  shall  be  made  or  certifiable  to  one  of  the  SEMI,  ASTM,  JEITA,  JIS,  or  DIN  standard  test
methods for the item as selected from Table 1 and specified in the purchase order.
9. 2   If  several  different  standard  test  methods  for  an  item  are  commonly  used  within  a  region,  it  is  particularly
important that the applicable method of test be identified in the purchase order.
9. 3   If  no  method  of  test  is  specified  in  the  purchase  order  and  if  standard  test  methods  from  different  geographic
regions are available, the default method shall be a method in common usage for the region of the purchaser of the
wafer.
9. 4  If no standard test method for an item is available, the test procedure to be used must be agreed upon between
supplier and customer.
9. 5  Information about the various test methods listed in Table 1 is provided in Related Information 2 together with
information about some additional test methods no longer in wide use throughout the industry.
10  Certification
10. 1   Upon  request  of  the  purchaser  in  the  contract  or  order,  a  manufacturer’s  or  supplier’s  certification  that  the
material was manufactured and tested in accordance with this specification, together with a report of the test results,
shall be furnished at the time of shipment.
10. 2  In the interest of controlling inspection costs, the supplier and the customer may agree that the material shall
be certified as “capable of meeting” certain requirements.  In this context, “capable of meeting” shall signify that the
supplier is not required to perform the appropriate tests in §9.  However, if the customer performs the test and the
material fails to meet the requirement, the material may be subject to rejection.
11  Product Labeling
11. 1  The wafers supplied under these specifications shall be identified by appropriately labeling the outside of each
box or other container and each subdivision thereof in which it may reasonably be expected that the wafers will be
stored  prior  to  further  processing.    Identification  shall  include  as  a  minimum  the  nominal  diameter,  conductivity
type,  dopant,  orientation,  resistivity  range,  and  lot  number.    The  lot  number,  either  (1)  assigned  by  the  original
manufacturer of the wafers, or (2) assigned subsequent to wafer manufacture but providing reference to the original
lot  number,  shall  provide  easy  access  to  information  concerning  the  fabrication  history  of  the  particular  wafers  in
that  lot.    Such  information  shall  be  retained  on  file  at  the  manufacturer’s  facility  for  at  least  one  month  after  that
particular lot has been accepted by the customer.
11. 2  Alternatively, if agreed upon between supplier and customer, one of the box labeling schemes in SEMI T3
shall be used and the information listed in ¶11.1 that is not included on the label shall be retained in the supplier’s
data base for at least one month after that particular lot has been accepted by the customer.
11. 3  Wafers of Category 1.15 (300 mm in diameter) shall be shipped in packages labeled in accordance with SEMI
M45.



SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 36
12 Packing and Shipping Container Labeling
12. 1  Special packing requirements shall be subject to agreement between the supplier and customer.  Otherwise, all
wafers shall be handled, inspected, and packed in such a manner as to avoid chipping, scratches, and contamination
and in accordance with the best industry practices to provide ample protection against damage during shipment.
12. 2  Wafers of Category 1.15 (300 mm in diameter) shall be shipped in accordance with SEMI M45.
12. 3  Unless otherwise indicated in the purchase order, all outside wafer shipping containers shall be labeled in
accordance with ANSI/EIA 556-B.

APPENDIX 1
FLATNESS DECISION TREE
NOTICE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  M1.    Approval  was  by  full  letter  ballot
procedures with publication authorized by the NA Regional Standards Committee on October 21, 1999.
A1-1  Scope
A1-1.1    The  increasing  complexity  of  integrated  circuits  and  the  reduction  in  design  rule  dimensions  place  new
demands  on  the  characterization  of  wafer  surface  geometry.    Various  high  resolution  optical  lithographic  systems
have very limited depth of field and use a variety of methods to hold the wafer, to establish the focal plane, and to
position the wafer relative to the focal plane during exposure.  These varying focusing and location methods differ
enough  to  make  a  single,  simple  flatness  criterion  (such  as  global  TIR)  ineffective  in  predicting  successful  or
unsuccessful lithography in all cases.
A1-1.2    To  clarify  the  requirements  for  wafer  flatness  characterization  for  the  various  classes  of  lithographic
equipment, the decision tree depicted in Figure A1-1 has been developed.  This tree gives an orderly procedure for
selecting the various parameters that must be specified if wafer flatness is specified.
A1-1.3  In this tree, it is assumed that the focal point is the site center for all parameters, except for SFQD, SFQR,
SFSD, and SFSR, where the focal plane is identical to the reference plane.  Most flatness characterization systems
employ  this  convention.    However,  a  number  of  photolithographic  aligners  use  slightly  different  conventions  for
determining the focal plane.  Currently, the difference between the centerpoint and other focusing conventions has
not been quantified, but it is presumed to be insignificant for material characterization purposes.
A1-1.4    For  sites  to  be  included  in  the  measurement,  the  site  center  must  lie  within  the  Flatness  Quality  Area
(FQA).    For  subsites  (se  Figure  A1-2)  to  be  included  in  the  measurement,  the  subsite  center  must  lie  within  a  site
whose center is within the FQA and some of the subsite must lie within the FQA (see Figure A1-3).
A1-2  Use of the Flatness Decision Tree
A1-2.1  In the decision tree, there are decision blocks, shown as diamonds, whose use requires some knowledge of
the  lithographic  tool  to  be  used.    The  rectangular  blocks  require  information  to  be  furnished;  this  information  is
dependent  on  the  device  layout  and  the  manufacturing  procedures  to  be  employed  (such  as  dedicated  or  mixed
aligner use).
A1-2.2    Step  1  —  Select  the  Fixed  Quality  Area  (FQA):  Decide  on  and  specify  the  nominal  edge  exclusion,  EE,
which defines the FQA.  (See Figure 1.)
A1-2.3  Step 2 — Choose the Measurement Method: Choose global flatness (G) if the lithographic tool uses a single,
global exposure of the wafer, or choose site flatness (S) if the lithographic tool steps across the wafer, exposing only
a portion of the wafer at a time.
A1-2.3.1  If global flatness is chosen, proceed to Step 3.  If site flatness is chosen, it is also necessary to specify site
size (related to exposure area dimensions) and site array (including (a) number of sites, (b) location of sites relative
to the center of the FQA and to each other, as in an offset or bricklaying pattern, and (c) whether or not partial sites
are to be excluded).
A1-2.4    Step  3  —  Choose  the  Reference  Surface:  Choose  front  surface  (F)  or  back  surface  (B),  depending  on
whether the lithographic tool is referenced to the front or back surface.
A1-2.5  Step 4 — Choose the Reference Plane and Area:
A1-2.5.1    For  global  flatness  measurements,  a  global  reference  plane  is  appropriate.    If  the  lithographic  tool  is
referenced to the back surface, an ideal plane (I) defined by the chuck which holds the wafer is appropriate.  If the
lithographic tool is referenced to the front surface, either a 3-point plane (3) defined by three points equally spaced
about the edge of the front surface of the wafer or a plane defined by the least squares fit to the front surface (L) may
be appropriate.  The 3-point plane is appropriate if the lithographic tool holds the wafer in this fashion and does not
allow interactive gimbaling of the wafer, while the least squares plane is appropriate if the lithographic tool allows
interactive gimbaling of the wafer.

Figure A1-1
Flatness Decision Tree
A1-2.5.2  For site flatness measurements, any of the above three planes [(1), (3), or (L)] may be suitable or, if the
wafer is regimballed once at each site, a site least squares reference plane (Q) may be appropriate or, if the wafer is
regimballed more than once at each site, a subsite least squares reference plane (S) may be appropriate.
A1-2.6  Step 5 — Choose the Measurement Parameter: Choose either  TIR,  also  known  as  range (R), or FPD, also
known as deviation (D).  In the case of site measurements, it is possible to specify the maximum value of (R) or (D)
or the percentage of the sites (or FQA) which have an (R) or (D) less than some specified value.
A1-2.7    The  codes  in  parentheses  in  Steps  2  through  5  may  be  used  to  form  a  code  which  uniquely  defines  the
measurement technique as follows:
• Position 1: Measurement Method (G) or (S),
• Position 2: Reference Surface (F) or (B),


SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 39
• Position 3: Reference Plane and Area (I), (3), (L), (Q), or (S), and
• Position 4: Measurement Parameter (R) or (D).
A1-2.7.1  Stating this code, the numerical values for the FQA parameters (and, if required, information on site size
and  array),  and  the  numerical  limit  for  the  measurement  parameter  provides  enough  information  to  describe  the
measurement and provide numerical limits.
A1-3  Future Developments
A1-3.1  As noted above, there may be specific systems which are not exactly described by one of the branch ends on
this  decision  tree.    This  tree  is  an  approximation  of  the  more  complete  one  which  would  describe  all  existing  and
possible lithographic technologies.

SHAPE DECISION TREE
NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of M1.  Approval was by full letter ballot procedures with
publication authorized by the NA Regional Standards Committee on October 21, 1999.
A2-1  Scope
A2-1.1    In  modern  wafer  fabrication  processes,  wafer  surface  geometry  in  the  unclamped  state  can  be  a  sensitive
indicator  of  process  effects.    Larger  wafer  diameters  and  increasing  complexity  of  processes  and  circuits  have
increased the need for accurate, standardized measurement of unclamped wafer geometry.  The quantities that have
historically  been  used,  Bow  and  Back  Surface  Referenced  Warp,  may  be  inadequate  to  describe  and  quantify  the
geometries  of  interest  in  advanced  processes.    Additional  surface  geometry  quantities,  such  as  Sori  and  Median
Surface Referenced Warp, have been introduced into standards.
A2-1.2  In addition, there is considerable confusion as to the precise meaning of these quantities, even though they
are defined in the applicable SEMI test methods.
A2-1.3  The Shape Decision Tree was developed to provide an orderly method of identifying each of the variables
involved in the quantities used to quantify unclamped wafer surface geometry.  As such, the tree provides a concise
and precise description of each shape quantity.  A branch of the tree consists of a selection of one of the choices for
each variable.  The variables and the choices for each are listed in Table A1-1.
A2-1.4  Four branches of the tree, representing quantities for which measurement methods have been standardized
by SEMI, are depicted in Figure A1-1.  There are many other branches of the tree, not all of which may represent
practical combinations of variables.
A2-2  Use of the Shape Decision Tree
A2-2.1  Step 1.  Select the Fixed Quality Area (FQA): Decide on and specify the nominal edge exclusion, EE, which
defines the FQA.  (See Figure 1.)
A2-2.2  Step 2.  Select the measurement method: global (over the entire fixed quality area) or local (over a site).
NOTE 1:  At  present,  all  shape  quantities  in  common  use  are  global  measurements.    The  significance  and  use  of  local  shape
quantities have yet to be defined.
A2-2.3  Step 3.  Select the reference surface: front, median, or back, to be used to establish the reference plane.
A2-2.4  Step 4.  Select the kind of reference plane: least-squares or 3-point.
NOTE 2:  A  measurement  made  with  a  least-squares  reference  plane  is  less  affected  by  small  changes  in  wafer  position  within
the measurement apparatus than is a measurement made with a 3-point reference plane.
A2-2.5  Step 5.  Determine whether the effects of gravitational sag on the wafer are accounted for (yes) or not (no).
NOTE 3:  Gravitational effects may be accounted for by inverting the wafer during the measurement, by placing the wafer in a
vertical or nearly vertical position during the measurement, or mathematically.
A2-2.6    Step  6.    Select  the  measurement  surface:  front,  median,  or  back,  for  which  the  deviations  are  to  be
measured.
A2-2.7    Step  7.    Select  the  measurement  pattern:  full  scan  (a  regular  array  of  measurement  points  over  the  entire
measurement  area),  partial  scan  (a  specified  pattern  of  measurement  points  covering  only  a  portion  of  the
measurement area), or centerpoint (measurement at the center of the wafer only).
A2-2.8  Step 8.  Select the parameter to be determined: range (TIR) or maximum RPD.
A2-2.9    Step  9.    Compare  the  branch  thus  obtained  with  the  branches  in  Figure  A2-1.    If  the  branch  obtained
matches one of the branches illustrated in Figure A1-1, the resulting quantity is given by the code shown in the box
at the bottom of the branch.  Standard test methods have been adopted for measurement of each of these quantities.
If the branch obtained does not match any of the branches illustrated in Figure A2-1, the quantity obtained has not
been given a standardized term, nor has a standard test method been adopted for its measurement.

A2-2.9.1    These  codes,  which  uniquely  describe  the  various  branches,  are  formed  from  the  codes  in  Table  A2-1.
Stating  this  code  together  with  the  numerical  value  for  the  FQA  nominal  edge  exclusion  provides  enough
information to describe the shape parameter and to establish numerical limits for it.
A2-2.9.2  Table A2-2 summarizes the shape parameters for which SEMI has standardized test methods.  This table
lists the code, the term in common use for the parameter, the SEMI test method, and the expanded form of the code.

SURFACE METAL CONTAMINATION
NOTICE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  M1  and  is  not  intended  to  modify  or  supersede
the official standard.  Approval was by full letter ballot procedures with publication authorized by the NA Regional
Standards  Committee  beginning  with  the  1995  edition  of  the  standard.    Determination  of  the  suitability  of  the
material is solely the responsibility of the user.
R1-1  Scope
R1-1.1    Maximum  allowable  surface  metal  contamination  levels  for  wafers  to  be  used  in  integrated  circuit  (IC)
fabrication generally depend upon the IC device density and upon the IC process design.  In general, as the device
density increases, the allowable surface metal contamination levels become lower.
R1-1.2  This related information is intended to provide guidance regarding allowable surface concentrations of metal
contaminants that have been reported to be deleterious to circuit and device performance.
R1-2  Suggested Allowable Surface Metal
Contamination Levels for 1 μm Geometries
R1-2.1  Table R1-1 lists suggested surface metal limits for
circuits  and  devices  with  a  minimum  linewidth  in  the
range of 0.8 μm to 1.2 μm for two alkali metals (Na, K), a
light  metal  (Al),  and  five  heavy  metals  (Cr,  Fe,  Ni,  Cu,
Zn).    These  are  same  elements  as  are  listed  in  the  items
under Section 2-7 of Table 1, Part 2, and they are listed in
the same order as they appear in that table.
Contaminant  levels  in  Table  R1-1  are  significantly  higher  than
would  be  allowed  for  leading  edge  technologies  at  the  time  of
approval of this standard.
R1-3  Test Methods
R1-3.1    The  test  methods  suitable  for  use  in  determining
the  levels  of  each  surface  metal  contaminant  are  listed  in
the  items  under  Section  2-7  of  Table  1,  Part  2.    This  list
and the related discussion of these test methods in Related Information 2 should be referenced in selecting methods
appropriate for testing the individual surface metals.

R2-1  Scope
R2-1.1    This  Related  Information  Section  discusses  aspects  of  the  various  test  methods  listed  in  Table  1  together
with  additional  information  about  other  test  methods  that  are  not  listed  in  Table  1  but  either  have  been  or  still  are

R2-1.3    Note  that  silicon  wafers  are  extremely  fragile.    While  the  mechanical  dimensions  of  a  wafer  can  be
measured by use of tools such as micrometer calipers and other conventional techniques, the wafer may be damaged
physically  in  ways  that  are  not  immediately  evident.    Special  care  must,  therefore,  be  used  in  the  selection  and
execution of measurement methods.

R2-3  General Characteristics
R2-3.1  Crystal Orientation—The crystallographic orientation of the source crystal can be determined by the x-ray
methods of SEMI MF26, JEITA EM-3501, or DIN 50433/1, the optical method of SEMI MF26 or DIN 50433/2, or
the  Laue  method  of  DIN  50433/3.    X-ray  methods  are  most  commonly  used  by  wafer  suppliers.  {Need  some
discussion here about differences between MF26 and EM-3501}}
R2-3.2  Conductivity Type—One of the five methods of SEMI MF42, one of the methods of JIS H 0607, or one of
the  four  methods  of  DIN  50432  should  be  used  to  determine  conductivity  type.    This  quantity  is  generally  well
controlled by silicon wafer suppliers and is not usually verified on incoming.
R2-3.3  Many of these tests need to be carried out in cleanroom environments of ISO Class 4, 5, or 6 depending on
the cleanliness requirements.  These classes are defined in ISO 14664-1.
R2-4  Electrical Characteristics
R2-4.1  Resistivity of wafers is most appropriately determined for referee purposes by SEMI MF84 or DIN 50431.
Under  some  circumstances  these  tests  may  be  considered  destructive,  and  an  alternative  means  may  be  required.
One nondestructive test is SEMI MF673, having a range from 0.0001 to 100 Ω·cm.  Another nondestructive test is
SEMI MF398, which is limited to carrier concentrations in the ranges from 1.5 × 10

to 1.5 × 10
21
cm
−3
for n-type
silicon and from 3 × 10
18
to 5 × 10
20
cm
−3
for p-type silicon, and has only moderate inter-laboratory precision.  Other
older  methods  that  require  a  bar-shaped  test  specimen  include  SEMI  MF43  and  DIN  50430;  these  methods  are  no
longer  in  general  use.    It  is  also  possible  to  establish  the  dopant  density  from  room  temperature  measurements  in
silicon  using  SEMI  MF723  (for  boron,  phosphorus,  or  arsenic  doped  silicon)  or  DIN  50444  (for  boron  and
phosphorus doped silicon only).  SEMI MF1527 is a useful standard in describing ways of ensuring that resistivity
measuring instruments are performing correctly.
R2-4.2  Radial Resistivity Variation is generally determined by SEMI MF81 or DIN 50435.  These test methods use
several different measurement positions so the desired position must be specified.  It is also possible to measure the
resistivity  in  one  of  the  circular  patterns  specified  in  SEMI  MF1618  using  SEMI  MF1529  as  the  resistivity
measurement method.
R2-4.3  Resistivity Striations can generally be viewed visually using one of the techniques discussed in Section R2-

# 9

9.  For an electrical measurement, spreading resistance (SEMI MF525) is generally employed but this is strictly an
off-line measurement.
R2-4.4  Minority Carrier Lifetime can be measured by a number of methods.  The photoconductive decay methods
(SEMI MF28, JIS H 0604, and DIN 50440/1 all require the use of special test specimens;  Microwave reflectivity
measurements (SEMI MF1535 and JEITA EM-3502) are applicable to measurements on wafers, but special surface
passivation procedures may be required to obtain meaningful results.  Minority carrier lifetime may also be inferred
from measurements made in accordance with SEMI MF1388, which yields generation lifetime if the measurements


SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 46
are  made  at  room  temperature  and  recombination  lifetime  if  they  are  made  at  elevated  temperature  (50°  to  75°C).
The  test  specimens  required  for  this  test  method  can  be  made  by  procedures  compatible  with  typical  wafer
processing.
R2-5  Chemical Characteristics
R2-5.1  Oxygen Concentration in relatively high resistivity specimens (
ρ > 1 to 3 Ω·cm at room temperature) should
be  measured  by  infrared  techniques.    SEMI  MF1188,  JEITA  EM-3504,  and  DIN  50438  all  utilize  approximately
normal  incidence  illumination  and  the  IOC-88  calibration  factor  to  determine  the  interstitial  oxygen  content.    See
SEMI  M44  for  a  discussion  of  other  calibration  factors  and  their  relationship  to  IOC-88.    SEMI  MF1619  uses  p-
polarized radiation, incident at the Brewster angle to reduce the multiple reflections from polished wafers.  For more
heavily doped wafers, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS, SEMI MF1366) and gas fusion analysis (GFA) can
be  used  to  determine  total  oxygen  content.    There  is  no  standardized  method  for  performing  GFA,  and  the
repeatability of this technique is generally poorer than SIMS.
R2-5.2    Radial  Oxygen  Variation  should  be  determined  by  measuring  the  oxygen  content  by  one  of  the  above
methods at selected locations on the wafer defined in SEMI MF951.  Usually measurements are made at the center
and at a single point on the primary flat or notch bisector 10 mm from the edge of the wafer opposite the fiducial;
this is known as test plan A-1.
R2-5.3    Carbon  Concentration  should  be  measured  by  SEMI  MF1391,  JEITA  56,  and  DIN  50438/2.    The  most
modern  calibration  coefficients  are  used  in  SEMI  MF1391  and  JEITA  56.    For  these  methods,  the  test  specimen
cannot be too heavily doped, and special thick test specimens may be necessary.
R2-5.4  Boron Contamination in heavily doped n-type silicon can be determined by SEMI MF1528.
R2-6  Structural Characteristics
R2-6.1  Dislocation Etch Pit Density, Slip, Lineage, Twins, and Swirl are usually displayed by etching and visual or
microscopic observation.  JIS H 0609 is a comprehensive test method for carrying out this procedure with the use of
non-chromic etchants.  SEMI MF1809 also recommends non-chromic etchants for this test.  For the full procedure,
SEMI MF1809 must be used with other standards including SEMI MF1726 and SEMI MF1810.  DIN 50434 is an
older,  but  comprehensive  test  procedure  to  observe  these  and  other  structural  defects  based  on  chrome-containing
etchants.  It is also possible to observe these defects by x-ray topography using DIN 50443/1.
R2-6.2    Shallow  Pits  can  be  exposed  by  the  relatively  low  temperature  heating  cycle  and  procedures  in  SEMI
MF1049 if they are present in sufficient density, but testing for shallow pits in production environments is usually
carried  out  using  the  temperature  cycle  in  SEMI  MF1727  followed  by  etching  with  etchants  discussed  in  SEMI
MF1809, examination by SEMI MF1726, and counting by SEMI MF1810.  They can also be observed by using JIS
H 0609.
R2-6.3    Oxidation  Induced  Stacking  Faults  (OISF)  can  be  observed  by  using  JIS  H  0609,  or  by  using  the
temperature cycle in SEMI MF1727 followed by etching with etchants discussed in SEMI MF1809, examination by
SEMI  MF1726,  and  counting  by  SEMI  MF1810.    OISF  can  also  be  observed  by  x-ray  topography  using  DIN
50443/1 following thermal treatment according to JIS H 0609 or SEMI MF1727.
R2-6.4    Oxide  Precipitates  (Bulk  Micro  Defects, BMD)  are  generated  with  the  use  of  a  temperature  cycle  such  as
those  in  SEMI  MF1239.    The  amount  of  precipitation  can  be  measured  by  the  oxygen  reduction  method  of  SEMI
MF1239 or by direct observation by infrared that has not yet been standardized.
R2-6.5  Bulk Defects can be detected by x-ray topography in accordance with DIN 50443/1.
R2.7  Dimensional Characteristics
R2-7.1  Diameter is presently very well controlled in silicon wafers that have been edge profiled with cam follower
equipment.  For three-point measurements at locations defined by SEMI MF2074 and, except for positions on 150
mm  diameter,  n-type  (100)  wafers,  by  DIN  50441/4.    The  latter  utilizes  a  measuring  or  projection  microscope  to
make  the  diameter  measurements,  but  the  former  allows  a  dial  gauge  or  any  other  equally  accurate  method  of
dimensional measurement.


SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 47
R2-7.2  Flat Length should be determined by SEMI MF671.  If flat diameter is specified instead of flat length, it can
be  determined  by  ¶6.2.1  of  DIN  50441/4  or  by  a  dial  gauge  method  as  agreed  upon  between  the  supplier  and
customer.    Both  SEMI  MF671  and  DIN  50441/4  take  account  of  the  possibility  that  the  ends  of  the  flat  might  be
rounded.
R2-7.3  Notch Dimensions should be determined by SEMI MF1152 (see Figure 5).
R2-7.4  Flat Orientation can be confirmed by SEMI MF847.  There is no standardized method for determining the
crystallographic orientation of the diameter that bisects the notch.
R2-7.5  Edge Profile is usually determined by using one of the two templates (see Figure 6) with Method B of SEMI
MF928  or  Procedure  2  of  DIN  50441/2,  both  of  which  are  nondestructive.    The  other  two  procedures  in  these
methods are destructive and not so widely used.
R2-7.6    Thickness  is  usually  determined  at  the  center  point  of  the  wafer  with  the  use  of  SEMI  MF1530,  an
automated  technique.    Manual  techniques  originally  used  in  the  industry  include  SEMI  MF533,  JIS  H  0611,  and
DIN 50441/1.
NOTE 2:  Test  methods  SEMI  MF1530  (for  thickness,  thickness  variation,  and  flatness),  SEMI  MF1451  (for  sori),  and  SEMI
MF1390  (for  warp)  may  not  be  suitable  for  use  on  large  diameter  wafers  with  polished  back  surfaces.    New  standardized  test
methods for measuring these parameters on such wafers are under development.
R2-7.7    Total  Thickness  Variation  (TTV)  was  originally  determined  with  the  use  of  manual  5-point  techniques
covered in SEMI MF533, JIS H 0611, and DIN 50441/1.  JIS H 0611 differs from SEMI MF533 and DIN 50441/1,
in that the measurements in JIS H 0611 are taken at the center and at 5 mm from the edge on diameters parallel and
perpendicular to the primary flat or notch bisector, while the measurements in SEMI MF533 and DIN 50441/1 are
taken at the center and at 6 mm from the edge on diameters 30 degrees and 120 degrees counterclockwise from the
bisector to the primary flat or notch (with the wafer facing front surface up).  TTV can also be determined with the
use  of  SEMI  MF657,  which  involves  a  continuous  scan  pattern  over  a  portion  of  the  wafer  surface.    Currently,
however,  it  is  most  frequently  determined  using  SEMI  MF1530,  which  involves  an  automated  continuous  scan
pattern over the entire wafer surface.  In this case, the quantity determined is equal to the global flatness GBIR (see
Appendix 1 and Note 1, above).
R2-7.8    Surface  Orientation  can  be  determined  by  the  x-ray  methods  of  SEMI  MF26,  JEITA  EM-3501,  or  DIN
50433/1, the optical method of SEMI MF26 or DIN 50433/2, or the Laue method of DIN 50433/3.
R2-7.9  For off-orientation {111} wafers, the orthogonal misorientation is specified for each of the wafer categories
in Tables 4 through 9.  There is no standardized measurement method for this property so it should be determined by
a method agreed upon between supplier and customer.
R2-7.10  Bow can be determined with the manual methods SEMI MF534 and JIS H 0611.  Currently, bow is not as
widely used a parameter as warp.
R2-7.11  Warp is currently most often measured with the use of SEMI MF1390, which is an automated method with
full surface scan and correction for gravitational sag.  It can also be measured with the use of the contactless manual
method SEMI MF657, in which the prescribed scan pattern covers only a portion of the wafer surface in which there
is  no  correction  for  gravitational  sag.    As  noted  in  Appendix  2,  different  reference  planes  are  used  for  the  two
methods.    Because  SEMI  MF657  employs  a  back  surface  reference  plane,  the  measured  warp  may  include
contributions from thickness variation of the wafer.  SEMI MF1390 employs a median surface reference plane and
is not susceptible to interferences from thickness variations.  In general, the latter is preferred, especially for wafers
150 mm in diameter and larger (see Note 1, above).
R2-7.12  Sori , which is sometimes specified in lieu of bow or warp or both, can be determined by SEMI MF1451
(see Note 1, above).
R2-7.13    Global  Flatness  can  be  determined  by  either  capacitance  measurements,  as  in  SEMI  MF1530,  or  by
multiple beam interference, as in DIN 50441/3.  Generally, the former is considered to be more reliable, especially
as the need increases for measuring smaller flatness deviation (see Note 1, above).  As noted in ¶R2-7.7, GBIR is the
same as TTV; other global flatness parameters are discussed in Appendix 1.


SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 48
R2-7.14    Site  Flatness  is  generally  determined  by  SEMI  MF1530  (see  Note  1,  above).    The  most  commonly  used
site  flatness  parameter  is  SFQR;  other  site  flatness  parameters  are  discussed  in  Appendix  1.    Although  it  is  not
widely used, the scanning site flatness parameter SFSR was recently introduced.  For this parameter, use a subsite
width, Wss, equal to 8 mm and orient the wafer so the effective scan direction is along the wafer’s y-axis as defined
in SEMI M20.
R2-7.14.1  SEMI M49 is a guide for specifying test equipment for use in determining thickness, shape, and flatness
parameters on wafers intended to be used to fabricate advanced integrated circuits.
R2-7.15  Nanotopography should be determined by SEMI M43.  This guide gives a variety of options that can be
used,  so  it  is  essential  to  specify  the  various  conditions  that  are  desired  in  any  given  case.    The  conditions  chosen
should be agreed upon between supplier and customer.
R2-8  Front Surface Chemistry
R2-8.1  Surface Metal Contaminants
R2-8.1.1    Sodium,  aluminum,  potassium,  and  iron  can  be  measured  by  secondary  ion  mass  spectrometry  (SIMS),
inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry  (ICP/MS),  or  atomic  absorption  spectroscopy  (AAS).    SIMS  has
been  standardized  as  SEMI  MF1617.    The  latter  two  methods  are  frequently  combined  with  vapor  phase
decomposition (VPD), but they have not yet been standardized.
R2-8.1.2    Potassium,  chromium,  iron,  nickel,  copper,  and  zinc  can  be  measured  by  Total  Reflection  X-Ray
Fluorescence  Spectroscopy  (TXRF),  ICP/MS,  and  AAS.    TXRF  has  been  standardized  both  with  (SEMI  M33  and
ISO 17706) and without (ISO 14706) use of VPD to preconcentrate the surface metal contaminants.
R2-8.1.2.1  VPD is chemical preconcentration of the surface metals using vapor phase HF to decompose the surface
native oxide and a water (or acid-spiked water) droplet to scan across the wafer dissolving the surface metals.  The
recovery  rate  of  this  preconcentration  method  is  dependent  upon  the  chemistry  of  the  surface  metals  and  upon  the
chemistry used for the preconcentration.  An alternative preconcentration method to VPD is to scan an acid droplet
across the wafer surface.
R2-8.1.2.2  VPD/AAS is a single-element technique which is widely used in Japan.  It is element-specific and very
sensitive.    VPD/ICP-MS  is  a  rapid  multi-element  technique  which  is  a  more  recent  development.    It  is  also  very
sensitive,  but  its  reproducibility  is  dependent  upon  the  injection  process  into  the  ICP-MS.    VPD/TXRF  is  an  even
more  recently  developed  multi-element  technique.    It  is  also  very  sensitive,  but  its  reproducibility  is  dependent  on
the residue-drying process.
R2-8.2  Surface Organics can be measured by SEMI MF1982.  This standard describes two methods; the method to
be utilized should be agreed upon between supplier and customer.
R2-9  Surface Inspection Characteristics
R2-9.1  Visual Inspection of either the front or back surface of wafers can be carried out in accordance with SEMI
MF523 or JIS H 0614.  The following conditions should be used for examination under high intensity illumination:
• Background light intensity: 8 ± 2 fc (86 ± 22 lux),
• Angle (alpha): 45° ± 10°, and
• Angle (beta): 90° ± 10°.
See ¶6.8 for a discussion of which artifacts on the surface should be considered as defects.  SEMI MF154 is a useful
guide for identifying structures and contaminants seen on silicon surfaces.
R2-9.1.1  Scratches—In inspecting for scratches, it is important to note that while macro-scratches can be seen under
both  high  intensity  and  diffuse  illumination,  micro-scratches  can  be  seen  only  under  high  intensity  illumination.
Therefore, to separate the two kinds of scratches, it is necessary to count the scratches observed under both kinds of
illumination.    The  count  of  scratches  seen  under  diffuse  illumination  is  the  number  of  macro-scratches  while  the
difference  of  the  counts  seen  under  high  intensity  illumination  and  diffuse  illumination  is  the  number  of  micro-
scratches.    Of  course,  if  the  total  requirement  is  for  no  scratches  of  either  kind,  then  examination  under  high
intensity illumination only is adequate.


SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 49
R2-9.2  X-ray Topography (DIN 50443/1) can also be used to test for defects in silicon wafers.  This method may
see  defects  that  do  not  intersect  the  surface,  and  can  also  be  used  to  examine  for  bulk  defects  in  the  wafer  (see
Section 2.4.10 of Table 1).
R2-9.3    Automated  Surface  Inspection  by  Light  Scattering  can  also  be  used  to  detect  many  surface  defects,
especially on polished surfaces.  These techniques have not been fully standardized but there is a group of standards
that  assist  in  making  certain  that  the  instruments  are  performing  correctly.    These  include  SEMI  M52  for
determining  if  surface  scanning  inspection  systems  (SSIS)  have  suitable  characteristics  for  the  desired  use,  SEMI
M53  for  calibrating  SSISs,  SEMI  M58  for  assuring  that  the  calibration  artifacts  meet  the  desired  requirements,
SEMI M50 for determining capture rate characteristics of SSISs and SEMI M35 for discriminating among various
surface  features  with  an  SSIS.    Because  of  the  lack  of  complete  standardization,  the  testing  conditions  for  use  of
SSISs should be agreed upon between supplier and customer.
R2-9.3.1    Localized  Light  Scatterers  —  SSISs  are  particularly  appropriate  for  inspecting  polished  surfaces  for  the
presence of particles and other localized light scatterers (LLS).  In this case, it is essential to define the size ranges
(in  units  of  latex  sphere  equivalents,  LSE)  as  well  as  the  maximum  permissible  counts,  usually  in  terms  of  counts
per wafer, but occasionally in terms of counts per unit area.
R2-9.4  Surface Roughness affects the size of particle or other LLS that can be detected on a surface.  SEMI M40
provides guidance on how to measure and report surface roughness on planar surfaces.  Surface microroughness can
be determined with SSISs, through the use of the power spectral density as described in SEMI MF1811, or with an
atomic  force  microscope,  which  can  be  calibrated  with  the  use  of  JEITA  EM-3505.    Other  documents  useful  in
connection  with  surface  microroughness  measurements  include  ISO  4287/1  and  ANSI/ASME  B46.1.    Because  of
the lack of standardization, the testing conditions for surface microroughness measurements should be agreed upon
between supplier and customer.
R2-9.5  Back Surface Finish of 300 mm diameter wafers is specified as “polished.”  The standard quantitative test
for the polish finish, which is not a smooth as the mirror polished front surface, is gloss.  The general techniques for
determining gloss are given in ASTM Test Method D 523 and JIS Z 8741.  However, for measuring gloss of silicon
surfaces,  visible  illumination  at  a  60°  angle  of  incidence  is  referenced  to  a  mirror  polished  silicon  front  surface.
Surface microroughness measurements (see ¶R2-9.4) can also be used as a quantitative test for back surface finish,
especially when it is necessary to observe particles or other LLSs smaller than 0.25 μm LSE on the surface.

Document
This revision combines most of SEMI M1 with parts of SEMI M18 to
form a new set of specifications that includes:
Purpose, a new scope, referenced standards, ordering information
(consolidated with some of SEMI M18), requirements (assembled
from several existing sections in SEMI M1), sampling, test methods,
certification, and packing and shipping container labeling sections;
Basic polished wafer specifications (developed by the Basic Wafer
Specification TF);
The two appendices and one related information section included in
previous editions of SEMI M1; and
A new related information section on detailed discussion of test
methods, based largely on material previously in SEMI M28.
A new table of contents has been added to make it easier to locate
specific information in the standard, and the terminology section of
SEMI M1 was combined with SEMI MF1241 and issued as SEMI
M59.  The EDI codes from SEMI M18 remain in that standard.
The material in all of the substandards previously included at the end of
SEMI M1 is now included in the body of the document with no change
of the technical content.  In addition, polished wafers and substrates
have been assigned category numbers based on the previous
substandard designation number.  In some cases there are two
categories, based on differences in the edge rounding template used.
All of the specification requirements previously in the substandards
have been moved to tables as follows:
Substandard        Nominal        Diameter  Located in Table    Wafer Category(s)
SEMI M1.1 2 inch 4 1.1
SEMI M1.2 3 inch 4 1.2
SEMI M1.5 100 mm 5 1.5
SEMI M1.6 100 mm 5 1.6
SEMI M1.7 125 mm 5 1.7
SEMI M1.8 150 mm 6 1.8.1 and 1.8.2
SEMI M1.9 200 mm 9 1.9.1 and 1.9.2
SEMI M1.10 200 mm 8 1.10.1 and 1.10.2
SEMI M1.11 100 mm 7 1.11
SEMI M1.12 125 mm 7 1.12
SEMI M1.13 150 mm 8 1.13.1 and 1.13.2
SEMI M1.15 300 mm 9 1.15
Additional material related to 300 mm wafers is given elsewhere in
SEMI M1, most notably in ¶6.5.1.4, which describes the wafer marking
requirements.  Also it should be noted that (1) the information on
surface orientation, for which the substandards allowed any of a
number of options, has been moved to Item 2-1.8 of Table 1, Silicon
Wafer Specification Format for Order Entry, Parts 1 and 2, and (2) the
information on orthogonal misorientation, which is the same for all
(111) silicon wafers has been moved to Item 2-1.9 of the same table.

SPECIFICATlON FOR SILICON EPITAXIAL WAFERS FOR DISCRETE
DEVICE APPLICATIONS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  July  12,  2003.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  October
2003; to be published November 2003. Originally published in 1985; previously published September 1997.
1  Purpose
1. 1    This  specification  defines  silicon  epitaxial  wafer
requirements     for     discrete     semiconductor     device
manufacture.   It   is   restricted   to   wafers   with   device
feature sizes in excess of 1 μm or wafers with epi layers
thicker than 25 μm.  By defining inspection procedures
and  acceptance  criteria,  suppliers  and  consumers  may
uniformly  define  product  characteristics  and  quality
requirements.
2  Scope
2. 1  This specification covers characteristics of both the
substrate  (through  reference  to  SEMI  M1)  and  the
epitaxial layer including handling and packaging.
2. 2  This specification is specifically directed to silicon
homoepitaxial    deposits    thicker    than    25    μm    on
homogeneous   silicon   substrates   or   similar   epitaxial
wafers  that  are  to  be  used  to  make  discrete  devices.
Specifications  for  silicon  epitaxial  wafers  with  greater
uniformity and more stringent surface defect criteria are
given in SEMI M11.
2. 3    The  primary  standardized  properties  set  forth  in
this   specification   relate   to   physical,   electrical,   and
surface defect parameters.
2. 4    A  complete  purchase  specification  requires  that
additional  physical  properties  be  specified  along  with
suitable  test  methods  for  their  measurement.    SEMI
M18 may be used for this purpose.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

NOTE 4:  Care should be taken in converting between carrier
density   and   resistivity   using   SEMI   MF723.      Multiple
conversions    may    introduce    differences    in    values.    For
example,  converting  from  carrier  density  (C

7  Sampling
7. 1      Unless   otherwise   specified,   appropriate   sample
sizes  shall  be  selected  from  each  lot  according  to
ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4.  Each  quality  characteristic  shall  be
assigned    an    acceptable    quality    level    (AQL)    in
accordance  with  ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4.    Inspection  levels
shall be agreed upon between supplier and purchaser.
7. 2    Unless  otherwise  specified,  the  following  AQLís
shall be assigned:
7. 2.1  Epitaxial layer thickness, 6.5%,
7. 2.2  Epitaxial layer net carrier density, 6.5%,
7. 2.3  Epitaxial wafer defects, cumulative, 4.0%.
8  Test Methods
8. 1    Measurements  shall  be  carried  out  in  conformance
with  the  specified  SEMI  methods.  Where  no  methods
are  specified  or  where  choices  are  given,  the  supplier
and  purchaser  shall  agree  in  advance  on  the  means  for
making the measurement.
8. 2  Substrate    ó    Determine    in    accordance    with
methods defined in SEMI M1.
8. 3  Epitaxial Layer
8. 3.1  Thickness   ó   Determine   in   accordance   with
SEMI MF95 or SEMI MF110.
NOTE  6:    There  is  a  possibility  that  various  types  of  infrared
reflectance  instrumentation  may  result  in  different  values  of
epitaxial  layer  thickness.  Therefore,  the  instrumentation  used
shall be agreed upon between supplier and purchaser.
8. 3.2  Net  Carrier  Density  ó  Determine  by  method(s)
agreed upon between supplier and purchaser.
NOTE  7:      SEMI  MF1392  and  SEMI  MF1393  are  methods
for  measuring  net  carrier  density  using  a  mercury  probe
contact.    If  resistivity  is  measured,  as  by  SEMI  MF374  or
SEMI  MF525,  conversion  to  dopant  density  shall  be  made
using SEMI MF723. Net carrier density of very heavily doped
layers  (or  substrates)  may  be  found  using  SEMI  MF398.  Net
carrier   density   profiles   may   be   determined   directly   in
accordance   with   SEMI   MF1392   or   SEMI   MF1393   or
indirectly  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF672,  with  conversion
from  resistivity  to  net  carrier  density  in  accordance  with
SEMI  MF723.  If  the  method  used  for  determining  the  net
carrier   density   profile   is   not   the   same   as   that   used   to
determine  the  center  point  net  carrier  density,  correlation
between the two methods used shall be established.
8. 3.3  Epitaxial    Wafer    Defects    ó    Determine    in
accordance with the methods given in Table 1.
8. 3.3.1    Surface  inspection  shall  be  performed  before
any  other  testing.  Wafers  may  be  cleaned  prior  to
inspection    to    minimize    difficulty    in    the    visual
inspection of defects other than foreign matter.
8. 3.3.2    Inspection  for  slip  shall  be  done  using  grid
elements  constructed  in  accordance  with  SEMI  M17.
An  element  is  defective  if  it  contains  one  or  more  slip
lines.  The  total  number  of  defective  elements  shall  be
less than or equal to n, where n is listed in Table 1.
8. 4      If   substrates   of   different   type   and   net   carrier
density  than  the  product  substrates  are  to  be  used  for
deposition  control,  their  type,  net  carrier  density,  and
quantity  per  run  or  lot  shall  be  agreed  upon  between
supplier and purchaser.

SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SAPPHIRE
SUBSTRATES
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  December  4,  2003.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org
February 2004; to be published March 2004. Originally published in 1978; last published November 2003.
1  Purpose
1. 1    Sapphire  substrates  are  utilized  for  heteroepitaxial
growth  of  silicon  films  for  certain  types  of  device
structures.    The  properties  of  the  films  depend  in  part
on   the   properties   of   the   substrate   used.      These
specifications are intended to provide specifications for
the  criteria  necessary  for  growth  of  films  suitable  for
device production.
2  Scope
2. 1    These  specifications  cover  requirements  for  five
sizes (from 2 inch to 150 mm) of monocrystalline high-
purity  polished  sapphire  substrates.  Dimensional  and
crystallographic  orientation  characteristics  are  the  only
standardized  properties  set  forth  herein.  A  purchase
specification   may   require   that   additional   physical
properties  be  defined.  Many  of  these  properties  are
listed,    together    with    test    methods    suitable    for
determining  their  magnitude.    Additional  information
and  recommended  specification  levels  for  several  of
these  properties  are  provided  in  Related  Information
sections.
2. 2    These  specifications  are  directed  specifically  to
sapphire    substrates    with    one    polished    surface.
Substrates  polished  on  both  sides,  or  unpolished,  or
with   epitaxial   deposits,   are   not   covered;   however,
purchasers    of    such    substrates    may    find    these
specifications  to  be  a  useful  guide  in  defining  their
requirements.
2. 3    Appendix  1  covers  dimensional  requirements  for
reclaimed 3 inch sapphire substrates.
2. 4  For referee purposes, U.S. customary units shall be
used for substrates of 2.0 and 3.0 in. nominal diameters,
and  SI  (System  International,  commonly  called  metric)
units for 100 mm and larger diameter substrates.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability  of  regulatory  or  other  limitations  prior  to
use.

10  Test Methods
10. 1  Dimensions — Measure as follows:
10. 1.1  Diameter  —  Determine  by  a  method  agreed
upon   between   the   supplier   and   the   purchaser   at
locations      specified      in      Configuration      1      of
SEMI MF2074.
NOTE 3: Sapphire substrates are highly susceptible to surface
damage.  While  the  mechanical  dimensions  of  a  slice  can  be
measured  by  use  of  tools  such  as  micrometer  calipers  and
other conventional techniques, the substrate may be damaged
physically  in  ways  that  are  not  immediately  evident.  Special
care  must  therefore  be  used  in  the  selection  and  execution  of
measurement methods.
10. 1.2  Thickness,  Center  Point  —  Determine  at  the
center   of   the   substrate   (Point   2   in   Figure   4)   in
accordance with SEMI MF533.
10. 1.3  Total    Thickness    Variation    (5    point)    —
Determine  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF533,  except
that  thickness  measurements  shall  be  made  at  the  five
locations  in  Figure  4  instead  of  the  locations  specified
in  SEMI  MF533.    Points  1,  3,  4,  and  5  in  Figure  4,
which  define  the  locations  of  the  edge  measurements,
are located 6 mm in from the wafer periphery.
10. 1.4  Flat  Length  —  Determine  in  accordance  with
SEMI MF671.
10. 1.5  Bow    —    Determine    in    accordance    with
SEMI MF534.
10. 2  Flat Orientation — Determine in accordance with
SEMI MF847.
10. 3  Surface  Orientation  —  Determine  in  accordance
with the x-ray method of SEMI MF26.
10. 4  Crystal  Perfection  —  Unless  otherwise  specified,
determine in accordance with SEMI MF1810.
10. 5  Surface Defects and Contamination — Determine
defects in accordance with SEMI MF523.
10. 6  Other Impurities — Determine by methods agreed
upon between the supplier and the purchaser.
10. 7  Front  Surface  Finish  —  Determine  by  methods
agreed upon between the supplier and the purchaser.
10. 8  Back  Surface  Finish  —  Determine  by  methods
agreed upon between the supplier and the purchaser.
10. 9  Flatness  —  Determine  by  a  method  agreed  upon
between the supplier and the purchaser.
10. 10  Edge  Profile  —  Determine  by  a  method  agreed
upon  between  the  supplier  and  the  purchaser.    Method
B   of   SEMI   MF928   is   a   non-destructive   way   of
evaluating  the  shape  of  the  edge  profile;  if  this  method
is  used,  the  template  to  be  used  shall  be  agreed  upon
between the supplier and the purchaser.
11  Flat System
11. 1      Figures   2   and   3   describe   the   primary   and
secondary flat system.
11. 1.1  Primary Flat: 45° ± 2° in the counter-clockwise
direction  from  the  projection  of  the  c-axis  along  an  r-
plane.
11. 1.2  Secondary  Flat  (Optional):  90°  ±  2°  in  the
counter-clockwise   direction   from   the   primary   flat,
along an r-plane.
11. 2  The a-axis lies between the two flats bisecting the
90°  angle.  Projection  of  the  c-axis  lies  45°  in  the
clockwise direction from the primary flat and 90° in the
clockwise direction from the a-axis.
12  Certification
12. 1    Upon  request  of  the  purchaser  in  the  contract  or
order,  a  manufacturer’s  or  supplier’s  certification  that
the material was manufactured and tested in accordance
with this specification, together with a report of the test
results, shall be furnished at the time of shipment.
12. 2    In  the  interest  of  controlling  inspection  costs,  the
supplier  and  the  purchaser  may  agree  that  the  material
shall   be   certified   as   “capable   of   meeting”   certain
requirements.  In  this  context,  “capable  of  meeting”
shall signify that the supplier is not required to perform
the  appropriate  tests  in  Section  11.  However,  if  the
purchaser  performs  the  test  and  the  material  fails  to


SEMI M3-0304 © SEMI 1978, 2004 4
meet  the  requirements,  the  material  may  be  subject  to
rejection.
13  Packing and Marking
13. 1    Special  packing  requirements  shall  be  subject  to
agreement  between  the  supplier   and   the   purchaser.
Otherwise  all  slices  shall  be  handled,  inspected,  and
packed   in   such   a   manner   as   to   avoid   chipping,
scratches,  and  contamination,  and  in  accordance  with
the  best  industry  practices  to  provide  ample  protection
against damage during shipment.
13. 2  The substrates supplied under these specifications
shall be identified by appropriately labeling the outside
of  each  box  or  other  container,  and  each  subdivision
thereof, in which it may reasonably be expected that the
substrates  will  be  stored  prior  to  further  processing.
Identification shall include, as a minimum, the nominal
diameter, orientation, and lot number.  The lot number,
either  (1)  assigned  by  the  original  manufacturer  of  the
substrates,  or  (2)  assigned  subsequent  to  substrate’s
manufacture, but providing reference to the original lot
number,   shall   provide   ready   access   to   information
concerning   the   fabrication   history   of   the   particular
substrates   in   that   lot.      Such   information   shall   be
retained on file at the manufacturer’s facility for at least
one month after that particular lot has been accepted by
the purchaser.

SEMI M4-1103
SPECIFICATIONS FOR SOS EPITAXIAL WAFERS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  July  27,  2003.  Initially  available  on  www.semi.org  October
2003; to be published November 2003. Originally published in 1978; previously published July 2003.
1  Purpose
1. 1        These    specifications    cover    requirements    for
monocrystalline   silicon   epitaxial   layers   on   sapphire
substrates, used for semiconductor device manufacture.
The   combination   of   a   silicon   epitaxial   layer   on   a
sapphire  substrate  is  known  as  a  silicon  on  sapphire
(SOS)  epitaxial  wafer.    By  outlining  an  inspection
process   and   defining   various   reject   criteria,   both
suppliers and purchasers can uniformly define epitaxial
layer quality.
1. 2    The  defects  discussed  originate  from  two  sources:
those which are caused by imperfection in the sapphire
substrate   and   those   related   to   the   epitaxial   layer,
including handling and packaging.
2  Scope
2. 1    The  primary  standardized  properties  set  forth  in
this  specification  relate  to  physical,  dimensional,  and
electrical characteristics of SOS epitaxial wafers.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

supplier and purchaser.
7  Methods of Test and Measurement
7. 1  Substrate  —  Determine  by  methods  agreed  upon
between   the   user   and   supplier.   For   measurement
methods, see SEMI M3.
7. 2  Epitaxial Layer (See Note 4)
7. 2.1  Layer   Thickness   —   Determine   by   a   method
agreed  upon  between  supplier  and  purchaser.  The  film
thickness  at  Point  2,  at  the  wafer  center  as  shown  in
Figure  1,  is  the  nominal  film  thickness  for  the  wafer.

Recommended:  SEMI MF95, suitably modified for use
with SOS structures.
7. 2.2  Layer  Thickness  Variation  —  Unless  otherwise
specified,   the   radial   thickness   variation   shall   be
determined  from  values  measured  at  the  center  and
edge locations, as shown in Figure 1. Points 1, 3, 4, and
5  are  located  6  mm  in  from  the  wafer  periphery  and
define  the  location  of  the  edge  measurements.  All
thickness values must be within the specified range. For
example,  for  a  film  specified  at  0.50  μm  ±  10%,  all
readings  at  points  1ñ5  must  be  within  the  range  from
0. 45 to 0.55 μm.

7. 2.3  Resistivity  —  Determine  by  a  method  agreed
upon   between   supplier   and   purchaser.   Contacting
method:  SEMI MF374; Non-contacting method: SEMI
MF673.
7. 2.4  Radial   Resistivity   Variation   ó   Determine   in
accordance with sampling plan A of SEMI MF81.
7. 2.5  Film Crystallinity — Determine by the following
or an alternative method as agreed between supplier and
purchaser.
7. 2.5.1    SOS  films  can  display  varying  degrees  of  haze
due   to   polycrystalline   silicon   deposits   in   the   film.
These polycrystalline deposits can result from improper
deposition         temperatures,         substrate         surface
contaminants,  or  contaminants  in  the  reactor  or  reactor
gases.
7. 2.5.2      Haze   can   be   seen   visually   and   can   be
quantitatively  measured  by  ultraviolet  light  reflectance
spectroscopy   or   by   x-ray   diffraction   (pole   figure)
measurements.
3
The ultraviolet light reflectance (UVR)
value  is  commonly  measured  to  determine  the  film
crystalline  quality.    In  this  technique,  measure  the
relative  reflectance  at  two  wavelengths,  280  and  440
nm,  using  a  clean,  polished  (100)  silicon  substrate  as
the reference as in the following example:

value  shall  be  less  than  15  units.    This  value  is  an
average  of  5  points  measured  in  the  wafer  as  shown  in
Figure  1.    The  edge  measurements  are  located  at  12.5
mm in from the wafer periphery.
7. 2.5.4    For  thinner  films  from  0.2  to  0.6  μm,  the
reflectance  value  at  the  single  wavelength  of  280  nm
can be used.
7. 2.5.5  X-ray pole figure analysis measures the volume
concentration  of  microtwins,  as  %  (111),  in  the  silicon
film.
7. 2.5.6  The   ultraviolet   reflectance   values   and   pole
figure   values   are   dependent   on   film   thickness,   so
specified  limits  are  listed  for  each  film  thickness  in
Table 1.
7. 2.6  Microparticulate   Density   ó   SOS   films   can
display   varying   degrees   of   surface   cleanliness   as
viewed  with  a  microscope.    Small  particles  trapped  in
the film can cause yield losses in some devices.  Deter-
mine  the  density  of  small  particles  by  counting  the
particles  observed  during  an  X-Y  scan  across  the  wafer
using  Normarski  interference  contrast  microscopy  at
100◊.    For  particles  greater  than  2  μm  in  diameter,  the
particle  density  shall  be  less  than  2  defects  per  square
centimeter,  excluding  the  outer  6  mm  of  the  wafer
periphery.

7. 2.7  Surface Defects and Contamination — Determine
by  methods  agreed  upon  between  user  and  supplier.
SEMI MF154 is a useful guide for defining a variety of
surface features and establishing commonly understood
terms for describing surface defects and contamination.
SEMI   MF523   is   also   recommended   (see   Note   5).
Recommended  maximum  levels  of  surface  defects  and
contamination are listed in Table 2.
NOTE 4:  SOS wafers are susceptible to surface damage. The
thin  film  on  the  hard  sapphire  substrate  may  be  damaged
physically  in  ways  that  are  not  immediately  evident.  Special
care  must  therefore  be  used  in  the  selection  and  execution  of
measurement procedures.
NOTE   5:      In   SEMI   MF523,   defects   commonly   found   in
silicon  wafers  are  defined.  Some  of  these  terms  do  not  apply
to  SOS  wafers,  but  are  included  in  Table  2  to  provide  a
convenient  reference  point  to  the  silicon  wafer  and  epitaxial
wafer  standards.    In  this  case,  the  recommended  maximum
acceptable limit is shown as N.A. (not applicable).
8  Sampling
8. 1  Unless  otherwise  specified,  ASTM  Practice  E  122
shall  be  used.  When  so  specified,  appropriate  sample
sizes  shall  be  selected  from  each  lot  according  to
ANSI/ASQC   Z1.4-1993.   Each   quality   characteristic
shall be assigned an acceptable quality level (AQL) and
lot  total  percent  defective  (LTPD)  value  in  accordance
with  ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4-1993  definitions  for  critical,
major,  and  minor  classifications.  If  desired  and  so
specified   in   the   contract   or   order,   each   of   these
classifications may alternatively be assigned cumulative
AQL  and  LTPD  values.  Inspection  levels  shall  be
agreed upon between user and supplier.

SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON WAFERS FOR USE AS
PHOTOVOLTAIC SOLAR CELLS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  European  Materials  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  European  Regional
Standards Committee on July 28, 2000.  Initially available at www.semi.org September 2000; to be published
October 2000. Originally published in 1981; previously published in 1985.
NOTE: This document replaces the previous version of SEMI M6 and M6.1, M6.2, M6.3, M6.4, and M6.5 in
their entirety.
1  Purpose
1. 1   This  specification  covers  the  r equirements  for
silicon  wafers  for  use  in  photovoltaic  (PV)  solar  cell
manufacture.
2  Scope
2. 1  The dimensional characteristic s, crystalline defects
and  commonly  used  wafer  electronic  properties  are
described.    Two  classes  of  crystalline  silicon  materials
are recognized: monocrystalline and multicrystalline.
2. 2   This  standard  does  not  purport   to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
2. 3     SI (System    International)    units     are    used
throughout.
3  Referenced Standards
NOTE 1: The   specification   recognizes   only   two   discrete
material  forms  monocrystalline  and  multicrystalline.    In  the
monocrystalline    form    one    crystallographic    orientation
describes  the  whole  wafer  and  in  the  multicrystalline  case
there is more than one crystallographic orientation present.

4  Terminology
4. 1  dopant  —  A  chemical  element ,  usually  from  the
third or fifth columns of the periodic table, incorporated
in trace amounts in a semiconductor crystal to establish
its  conductivity  type  and  resistivity.  Common  doping
elements are boron and phosphorous.
4. 2  lot — For the purposes of this  document, (a) all of
the     wafers     of     nominally     identical     size     and
characteristics  contained  in  a  single  shipment,  or  (b)
subdivisions of large shipments consisting of wafers as
listed above which have been identified by the supplier
as constituting a lot.
4. 3  monocrystalline  —  (synonym:   single  crystal)  A
body of crystalline material that contains no large-angle
boundaries or twin boundaries.
4. 4  multicrystalline  —  A  body  of   crystalline  material
that contains large-angle boundaries or twin boundaries.
Most  crystals  of  this  body  have  dimensions  in  the
millimeter up to centimeter range.
5  Ordering Information

5. 1.4      Surface     orientation,     crystal     pla nes     for
monocrystalline wafers
5. 1.5  Conductivity type and dopant,
NOTE 3:   The  dopant  is  difficult  to  ascertain  in  the  finished

5. 1.7  Lot acceptance procedures (se e Section 6.4),
5. 1.8  Certification (if required) (see  Section 8),
5. 1.9  Packing and marking (see Sec tion 9),
5. 1.10    Selection   of   test   method   to   be    used   in
evaluating  those  items  for  which  alternate  tests  exist
(see Section 7), and
5. 1.11  Carbon and oxygen content.
5. 2   Optional  criteria.  The  followin g  items  may  be
specified optionally in addition to those listed above:
NOTE 4:  Items in Paragraph 5.2 are less commonly specified
than   the   others,   but   are   included   for   completeness   as
parameters   for   which   methods   of   evaluation   have   been
developed.
5. 2.1  Impurities other than common  doping elements,
5. 2.2  Diffusion length, and
5. 2.3  Minority carrier lifetime.
NOTE 5:   Up  to  now  diffusion  length  and  minority  carrier
lifetime  cannot  be  measured  with  sufficient  inter-laboratory
accuracy.  Subsequent  recommendations,  following  lifetime
round  robin  experiments,  will  be  available  in  the  future  and
will be presented in an addendum to this standard.
Even in the case of comparable and reproducible lifetime and
diffusion  length  measurements,  the  measured  characteristics
must  be  regarded  as  an  indication  for  solar  cell  efficiency.
There  is  no  general  relation  between  initial  minority  carrier
lifetime  and  solar  cell  efficiency  as  other  parameters  such  as
carbon or oxygen content will also influence the wafer in the
solar  cell  process.  However,  in  practical  cases  a  dependence
between minority carrier lifetime and solar cell efficiency can
be  found  for  a  fixed  solar  cell  process  and  a  certain  silicon
wafer material. If one of them is changed the relation between
them is suspect to change too.

the  contract  or  order,  each  of  these  classifications  may
alternatively  be  assigned  cumulative  AQL  and  LTPD
values.  Inspection  levels  shall  be  agreed  upon  between
the supplier and the purchaser.
7  Test Methods
NOTE 6:   Silicon  wafers  are  extremely  fragile.  While  the
mechanical dimensions of a wafer can be measured by use of
tools  such  as  micrometer  calipers  and  other  conventional
techniques, the wafer may be damaged physically in ways that
are  not  immediately  evident.  Special  care  must  therefore  be
used in the selection and execution of measurement methods.
7. 1   Length,  Width,  or  Diameter  —   Determine   the
diameter  of  circular  wafers  in  accordance  with  ASTM
Test Method F 613. Determine the side length of square
wafers  by  a  method  agreed  upon  between  the  supplier
and the purchaser.
7. 2     Thickness,    Center    Point    —    De termine    in
accordance  with  ASTM  Test  Methods  F  533  or  DIN
50441-1.
7. 3   Thickness  Variation  —  Determ ine  in  accordance
with ASTM Test Methods F 533 or F 657.
7. 4  Structural Class  —  Determine   the  structural  class
by  a  method  agreed  upon  between  the  supplier  and  the
purchaser.
7. 5   Surface  Orientation  —  Determ ine  in  accordance
with  ASTM  Test  Methods  F  26  or  DIN  50433-1,  DIN
50433-2 and DIN 50433-3.
7. 6   Conductivity  Type  —  Determi ne  in  accordance
with ASTM Test Methods F 42 or DIN 50432.
7. 7   Resistivity  —  Determine  by  m ethods  agreed  upon
between the supplier and the purchaser.
NOTE 7:     Resistivity    of    wafers    is    most    appropriately
determined  for  referee  purposes  by  ASTM  Method  F  84  or
DIN  50431.  Reliable  measurements  with  these  methods  can
only  be  made  in  regions  of  a  wafer  which  contain  no  grain
boundaries;  these  methods  are  therefore  not  appropriate  for
multicrystalline  material.  Under  some  circumstances  these
tests may be considered destructive, and an alternative means
may  be  required.  One  non-destructive  test  is  ASTM  Test
method F 673, having a range from 0.001 to 100 Ω-cm.  This
method  is  relatively  insensitive  to  the  presence  of  grain
boundaries   and   is   recommended   for   all   material   types.
Another  nondestructive  test  is  ASTM  Test  Method  F  398.
This method is limited to carrier concentrations in the ranges
from 1.5 × 10
18
cm
-3
to 1.5 × 10
21
cm
-3
for n-type silicon and
from  3  ×  10
18
cm
-3
to  5  ×  10
20
cm
-3
for  p-type,  and  has  only
moderate  inter-laboratory  precision.  Other  available  methods
include  ASTM  Test  methods  F  43  or  DIN  50430  (referee
methods requiring a bar-shaped sample).
7. 8  Other Impurities — Determine  by methods agreed
upon between the supplier and the purchaser.
NOTE 8:   ASTM  Test  Methods  F  1188,  F  1619  and  DIN
50438-1 are specific tests for oxygen. ASTM F 1391 and DIN
50438-2   are   specific   tests   for   carbon;   special   thick   test
specimens are necessary.
7. 9  Minority  Carrier  Diffusion  Len gth  —  Determine
by  methods  agreed  upon  between  the  supplier  and  the
purchaser.
NOTE 9:   Methods  for  minority  carrier  diffusion  length  are
listed in ASTM F 391.
7. 10    Minority   Carrier   Lifetime   —   D etermine   by
methods  agreed  upon  between  the  supplier  and  the
purchaser.
NOTE 10:      Methods     for     minority     carrier     lifetime
measurements  are  given  in  ASTM  F  28  (bulk  material),
ASTM F 1535 (wafers) and JEIDA-53 (wafers). As the wafer
methods measure an effective lifetime, the sample preparation
(surface    passivation)    and    measurement    conditions    will
influence the results and must be considered.
8  Certification
8. 1   Upon  request  of  the  purchaser   in  the  contract  or
order,  a  manufacturer’s  or  supplier’s  certification  that
the material was manufactured and tested in accordance
with this specification, together with a report of the test
results, shall be furnished at the time of shipment.

SEMI M6-1000 © SEMI 1981, 20005
8. 2   In  the  interest  of  controlling  in spection  costs,  the
supplier  and  the  purchaser  may  agree  that  the  material
shall   be   certified   as   ‘capable   of   meeting’   certain
requirements. In this context, ‘capable of meeting’ shall
signify  that  the  supplier  is  not  required  to  perform  the
appropriate tests in Section 7. However, if the purchaser
performs  the  test  and  the  material  fails  to  meet  the
requirement, the material may be subject to rejection.
9  Packing and Package Lab eling
9. 1   Special  packing  requirements   shall  be  subject  to
agreement  between  the  supplier  and  the  purchaser.
Otherwise  all  wafers  shall  be  handled,  inspected,  and
packed   in   such   a   manner   as   to   avoid   chipping,
scratches,  and  contamination,  and  in  accordance  with
the  best  industry  practices  to  provide  ample  protection
against damage during shipment.
9. 2   The  wafers  supplied  under  the se  specifications
shall be identified by appropriately labeling the outside
of  each  box  or  other  container  and  each  subdivision
thereof in which it may reasonably be expected that the
wafers   will   be   stored   prior   to   further   processing.
Identification  shall  include  as  a  minimum  the  nominal
diameter,    conductivity    type,    dopant,    orientation,
resistivity range, and lot number. The lot number, either
(1) assigned by the original manufacturer of the wafers,
or  (2)  assigned  subsequent  to  wafer  manufacture  but
providing  reference  to  the  original  lot  number,  shall
provide   easy   access   to   information   concerning   the
fabrication  history  of  the  particular  wafers  in  that  lot.
Such   information   shall   be   retained   on   file   at   the
manufacturer’s  facility  for  at  least  one  year  after  that
particular lot has been accepted by the purchaser.
