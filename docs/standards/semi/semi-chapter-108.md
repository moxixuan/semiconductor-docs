true  size  of  LLSs  other  than  PSL  spheres  (see  Section
3. 1).
2. 8  This practice supports requirements listed in SEMI
M52.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1    LLSs  are  normally  assigned  only  LSE  sizes,  not
physical diameters, because the response of an SSIS to
an    LLS    depends    on    the    SSIS    optical    system
characteristics    as    well    as    the    size,    shape,    and
composition  of  the  LLS.    The  LSE  size  assigned  to  a
particular   LLS   by   an   SSIS   calibrated   against   PSL
spheres may be different from that assigned to the same
LLS   by   another   similarly   calibrated   SSIS,   because
different     SSISs     have     different     optical     system
characteristics.
3. 2    PSL  spheres  may  have  specified  characteristics
(mean   diameter   uncertainty,   diameter   distribution,
spread  between  mean  and  modal  diameter)  that  differ
significantly  from  the  characteristics  of  the  resulting
deposition due to the transfer function of the deposition
system.  For this reason the practice is limited to the use
of   PSL   sphere   depositions   that   are   appropriately
characterized.  See Related Information 1.
3. 3    If  calibration  points  occur  at,  or  near,  dips  in  the
response  curve  (see  Section  5.3.17),  the  calibration
curve  will  not  be  single  valued;  therefore  dips  must  be
avoided as calibration points if a monotonic calibration
curve  is  to  be  obtained.    However,  if  a  complete
calibration  is  desired,  the  locations  and  magnitudes  of
the dips must be determined.  In this case there may not
be a one-to-one correlation between SSIS response and
LSE  size;  i.e.,  a  particular  instrument  response  may
correspond  to  more  than  one  LSE  size.

5. 3.13.1.)
3. 4  Background Contamination
3. 4.1    The  presence  of  localized  light  scatterers  with
LSE sizes near that of the nominal PSL diameter on the
reference  wafer  may  skew  the  results.    This  condition


1 See, for example, Locke, B. R., and Donovan, R. P., ìParticle
Sizing Uncertainties in Laser Scanning of Silicon Wafers,î Journal of
The Electrochemical Society, Vol 134, No. 7, 1987, pp. 1763ñ1771;
or Liu, B. Y. H., Chae, S.-K., and Bae, G.-N., ìSizing Accuracy,

may  result  in  a  large  error  or  poor  equivalent  sizing
accuracy.
3. 4.2    High  levels  of  localized  light  scatterers  on  the
reference  wafer  or  wafers  may  overload  the  SSIS  or
obscure   the   peak   of   the   deposited   PSL   sphere
distribution.    This  condition  may  also  result  in  a  large
error or poor equivalent sizing accuracy.
3. 4.3    For  these  reasons,  both  the  deposition  process
and  calibration  procedures  must  be  carried  out  in  a
clean  environment,  and  the  reference  wafers  must  be
handled   in   such   a   way   as   to   avoid   contamination
between deposition process and calibration.
3. 5    If  the  surface  roughness  of  the  reference  wafer  or
wafers   is   excessive,   the   peak   of   the   PSL   sphere
distribution may be obscured or distorted.
3. 6    If  the  SSIS  being  calibrated  is  not  operating  in  a
stable condition, the calibration may not be appropriate
for subsequent use of the system.  System stability can
be   evaluated   by   making   repeated   calibrations,   in
accordance   with   this   practice,   over   suitable   time
periods.

5  Terminology
5. 1  Definitions for general terms for silicon technology
are found in SEMI MF1241.
5. 2  Additional terminology is defined in SEMI M1.
5. 3  Definitions
5. 3.1  capture   rate   (CR)   ó   the   probability   that   a
scanning  surface  inspection  system  (SSIS)  detects  a
localized    light    scatterer    (LLS)    of    latex    sphere
equivalent  (LSE)  signal  value  at  some  specified  SSIS
operational setting.
5. 3.2  certified  reference  material  (CRM)  ó  a  material
accompanied  by  a  certificate,  one  or  more  of  whose
property   values   are   certified   by   a   procedure   that
establishes  its  traceability  to  an  accurate  realization  of
the unit in which the property values are expressed, and
for  which  each  certified  value  is  accompanied  by  an
uncertainty  at  a  stated  level  of  confidence  [ISO  Guide
30].
5. 3.2.1  Discussion  ó  In  the  context  of  this  practice,  a
CRM   is   a   certified   PSL   sphere   deposition   on   an
unpatterned  wafer  with  the  same  surface  films  and
finish  as  the  wafers  to  be  examined  by  the  calibrated
SSIS.    The  deposition  property  values  that  must  be
certified are the peak sphere diameter and the diameter
distribution  on  the  wafer  and  are  determined  by  both
the PSL sphere source and the deposition process.  The
wafer  may  contain  more  than  one  CRM.    See  Related
Information 1.
5. 3.3  coefficient  of  variation  (CV)  ó  one  standard
deviation, σ, expressed as a percentage of the mean of a
Gaussian distribution.
5. 3.4  deposition — an approximately known number of
PSL  spheres  of  known  size  distribution  placed  in  a
known location on the surface of a reference wafer.

5. 3.5  deposition process — the procedure used to place
the PSL spheres on the reference wafer.
5. 3.6  dynamic    range    ó    of    a    scanning    surface
inspection   system,   the   signal   range   covered   by   an
instrument with one set of measurement conditions.
5. 3.6.1  Discussion ó  The  useful  dynamic  range  is
limited  on  the  small  signal  side  by  the  background
noise or the inherent resolution of the instrument and on
the large signal side by saturation of the detector and/or
the related electronics.  The small signal limit is usually
defined  as  the  smallest  PSL  diameter  than  can  be
measured with a capture rate of at least 95%.
5. 3.7  false  count  ó  a  laser-light  scattering  event  that
arises  from  instrumental  causes  rather  than  from  any
feature  on  or  near  (in)  the  wafer  surface;  also  called
false positive; compare nuisance count.
5. 3.7.1  Discussion ó   False   counts   would   not   be
expected to occur at the same point on the wafer surface
during  multiple  inspection  scans,  and  hence  they  could
be   considered   as   random   ìnoiseî   that   could   be
identified by examining the results of repeated scans.
5. 3.8  histogram ó  a  representation  of  a  partitioned
(binned) data set as a bar graph in which the widths of
the  bars  are  proportional  to  the  sizes  of  the  bins  of  the
data   set   variable,   and   the   height   of   each   bar   is
proportional to the frequency of occurrence of values of
the variable within the bin.
5. 3.8.1  Discussion ó  In  presenting  data  for  the  size
distribution of LLSs, the data set variable is usually the
derived  LLS  size;  in  presenting  haze  data,  the  data  set
variable  is  usually  the  haze  in  ppm.    The  data  set  is
usually  partitioned  into  bins  of  equal  size  on  either  a
linear  or  logarithmic  scale,  as  appropriate.    The  bins  at
the low and high ends of the data set variable range are
customarily   plotted   with   the   same   width   as   the
remainder  of  the  histogram  even  though  they  may
represent  a  larger  or  smaller  range  of  the  independent
variable than the rest of the bins.
5. 3.9  laser-light scattering event ó a signal pulse that
exceeds  a  preset  amplitude  threshold,  generated  by  the
interaction  of  a  laser  beam  with  an  LLS  at  a  wafer
surface as sensed by a detector.
5. 3.9.1  Discussion ó  The  amplitude  of  the  signal  into
a  single  detector,  as  measured  for  any  combination  of
incident  beam  direction  and  collection  optics,  does  not
by  itself  convey  topographic  information,  for  example,
whether the LLS is a pit or a particle.  It does not allow
the observer to deduce the size or origin of the scatterer
without  other  detailed  knowledge,  such  as  its  index  of
refraction  and  shape.    In  a  scanning  surface  inspection
system, laser-light scattering events and the background


SEMI M53-1103 © SEMI 2003 4
signal  due  to  haze  together  comprise  the  signal  due  to
light scattering from a wafer surface.
5. 3.10  latex sphere equivalent (LSE) ó the diameter of
a  monodisperse  polystyrene  latex  sphere  that,  under
identical  test  conditions,  produces  the  same  detected
scattering intensity as the LLS under investigation.
5. 3.10.1  Discussion ó If the LLS is assumed to be due
to  a  particle  (or  pit),  the  LSE  size  (diameter)  of  the
particle  (or  pit)  is  given  in  units  of  length  followed  by
LSE;  for  example,  0.12  μm,  LSE.    This  unit  varies  in
different  ways  for  different  materials  from  instrument
to  instrument  because  of  differences  in  the  optical
systems  and  signal  processing  procedures  of  different
instruments.  Therefore a particular LLS generally does
not have the same LSE size when measured on different
model instruments or on different channels of the same
instrument.    If  elements  of  the  optical  system,  such  as
incidence  angle,  collection  solid  angle,  or  polarization,
of  an  SSIS  can  be  varied,  the  LSE  size  of  a  particular
LLS   will   not   necessarily   be   the   same   for   each
configuration of the optical system.
5. 3.11  localized  light  scatterer  (LLS)  ó  an  isolated
feature,  such  as  a  particle  or  a  pit,  on  or  in  a  wafer
surface,  resulting  in  increased  light  scattering  intensity
relative   to   that   of   the   surrounding   wafer   surface;
historically called light point defect because under high
intensity  optical  illumination  features  of  sufficient  size
appear as an isolated point of light.
5. 3.11.1  Discussion ó  Localized  light  scatterers  are
observed  by  automated  inspection  techniques  as  laser-
light    scattering    events.        Automated    inspection
techniques  are  quantitative  in  the  sense  that  scatterers
with  different  scattering  intensities  can  be  segregated.
However, the amplitude of the scattered light intensity,
or  ìlaser-light  scattering  eventî,  as  measured  by  any
combination  of  incident  beam  direction  and  collection
optics,    does    not    by    itself    convey    topographical
information about the LLS; particles and pits cannot be
distinguished   solely   on   the   basis   of   single-channel
amplitude  data.    Also,  the  observer  cannot  deduce  the
size,  shape,  or  composition  of  the  LLS  from  single-
channel  amplitude  alone.    The  presence  of  LLSs  does
not necessarily decrease the utility of the wafer.
5. 3.12  missing count ó the case in which an LLS fails
to  produce  a  laser-light  scattering  event;  also  called
false negative.
5. 3.13  multipoint   calibration   ó   a   procedure   for
calibrating  the  size  response  of  an  SSIS  using  a  set  of
accurately sized polystyrene latex spheres, deposited on
a wafer surface of the type to be inspected by the SSIS.
5. 3.13.1  Discussion ó  The  purpose  of  a  calibration  is
to relate the amount of light captured by an SSIS to the
physical size of the light scatterer.  The amount of light
scattered  from  a  localized  light  scatterer  (LLS)  that  is
captured by the SSIS is a function of both the scattering
characteristics  of  the  LLS  (including  the  directional
dependence  of  the  scattering)  and  the  geometry  of  the
collection  optics  of  the  SSIS.    For  a  given  wavelength
of  incident  radiation,  regular  objects  of  certain  sizes
exhibit  non-linearities,  usually  in  the  form  of  a  dip,  so
that  the  curve  of  scattering  amplitude  as  a  function  of
physical  size  of  the  scatterer  may  not  be  monotonic.
Thus, similar objects with modest variations in physical
size  can  scatter  the  same  amount  of  light.    Different
materials  may  exhibit  non-linearities  at  different  sizes.
Because  these  effects  tend  to  be  less  pronounced  for
irregular  particles  such  as  may  be  found  on  polished
wafer surfaces, instrument calibration is usually carried
out by avoiding the sizes of spheres that correspond to a
dip.      Sometimes,   however,   it   is   desired   to   fully
characterize  the  response  of  the  SSIS  to  a  particular
type  of  scatterer;  in  this  case,  the  calibration  can  be
carried  out  with  a  set  of  particles  with  sizes  that  cover
the  desired  range  with  adequate  density  to  ensure  that
any   non-linearities   in   the   scattering   amplitude-size
curve are detected.
5. 3.14  nominal  sphere  size  distribution  ó  the  stated
diameter distribution of a suspension of PSL spheres of
a certified diameter used in the calibration of SSISs.
5. 3.14.1  Discussion ó   The   nominal   sphere   size
distribution   is   usually   expressed   as   the   standard
deviation   or   the   coefficient   of   variation   of   the
distribution about the certified diameter.  Depending on
how the deposition is made, the size distribution of the
deposited  spheres  may  be  equal  to  the  distribution  in
the   original   suspension   or   it   may   be   significantly
narrowed by the deposition process.
5. 3.15  nuisance count ó a signal pulse that arises from
discrete  or  area  surface  or  near-surface  features  other
than  the  localized  light  scatterers  being  investigated;
compare false count.
5. 3.15.1  Discussion ó   The   presence   of   nuisance
counts  is  dependent  on  the  threshold  and  gain  settings
and  may  be  a  function  of  the  optical  configuration  of
the SSIS, the orientation of the wafer surface, or both.
5. 3.16  reference  wafer  —  for  calibrating  an  SSIS  in
accordance  with  this  practice,  an  unpatterned  wafer
with  the  same  surface  films  and  finish  as  the  wafers  to
be  examined  by  the  calibrated  SSIS  and  upon  which
one or more PSL sphere depositions have been certified
to   specified   uncertainties   for   peak   diameter   and
diameter distribution.
5. 3.17  response  curve  (RC)  —  the  modeled  relation
between  measured  scattered  light  intensity  (or  SSIS
signal  response)  and  PSL  sphere  peak  diameters.    The


SEMI M53-1103 © SEMI 2003 5
RC depends on the light source used, is in general non-
linear and may contain regions with dips that make the
response/diameter   relationship   multi-valued.      (See
Section 3.3).
5. 3.18  scanning surface inspection system (SSIS) ó an
instrument  for  rapid  examination  of  the  entire  quality
area of a wafer to detect the presence of localized light
scatterers  or  haze  or  both;  also  called  particle  counter
and laser surface scanner.
5. 3.19  threshold ó the level set on a scanning surface
inspection system (SSIS) to discriminate between signal
pulses of different size.
5. 3.19.1  Discussion ó   Thresholds   may   be   set   to
discriminate   between   true   counts   and   surface   or
electrical  noise  (nuisance  or  false  counts,  respectively)
or  between  different  sizes  of  light  scatterers.    Because
of   spatial   non-uniformity   of   the   intensity   of   the
scanning beam and the general use of overlapping scans
in  an  SSIS,  a  localized  light  scatterer  with  equivalent
size  near  the  threshold  may  generate  a  signal  greater
than or less than the threshold depending on its location
with  respect  to  the  path  of  the  scanning  beam.    The
former  is  identified  as  a  true  count  and  the  latter  is
identified as a missing count.
5. 3.20  true  count  ó  a  laser-light  scattering  event  that
arises    from    the    localized    light    scatterers    being
investigated.
5. 3.21  unimodal     distribution     ó     a     distribution
represented  by  a  histogram  with  constant  bin  size  that
has a single bell-shaped peak.
6  Summary of Practice
6. 1  The range of LSE values to be used for calibration
is defined for each dark channel that is to be calibrated.
6. 2      The   number   of   calibration   points   required   is
defined for each defined range.
6. 3      Suitable   reference   wafers   with   certified   PSL
distributions are obtained.
6. 4    The  reference  wafers  are  scanned  by  the  SSIS
being  calibrated  under  machine  conditions  identical
with  those  to  be  used  in  examining  wafers  with  the
calibrated SSIS.
6. 5  The peak diameter of the PSL spheres deposited on
each  reference  wafer  is  assigned  to  the  peak  value  of
the SSIS signal units.
6. 6    An  RC,  the  curve  of  SSIS  channel  response  as  a
function  of  SSIS  calibration  PSL  sphere  diameter,  is
constructed   through   the   data   points   obtained.      A
separate   calibration   curve   is   developed   for   each
channel.
7  Apparatus
7. 1  Scanning Surface Inspection System — designed to
detect,  size,  and  map  localized  light  scatterers  (LLSs)
on   unpatterned   semiconductor   wafers,   that   has   the
following capabilities:
7. 1.1    Scans  the  entire  fixed  quality  area  of  the  surface
of a wafer with a laser beam,
7. 1.2    Detects  localized  light  scatterers  as  laser-light
scattering events,
7. 1.3  Has a user definable sensitivity threshold,
7. 1.4    Can  generate  a  data  set  file  of  the  distribution  of
the detected LLSs as a function of reported size (LSE),
7. 1.5    Can  generate  a  histogram  from  the  data  set  file,
or  can  output  the  data  set  file  in  a  form  that  can  be

that can generate the histogram,
7. 1.6        Is    sufficiently    repeatable    for    the    intended
application, and
7. 1.7    Handles  wafers  in  a  Class  4  or  better  clean
environment as defined in ISO 14644-1.
8  Reference Wafers
8. 1  Substrates  —  Use  bare  semiconductor  wafers  with
a  native  oxide  (or  other  filmed)  surface  of  the  type
intended  to  be  tested  with  the  SSIS  to  be  calibrated  as
substrates   for   the   certified   depositions   of   the   PSL
spheres.    This  is  particularly  important  because  SSIS
response  is  affected  by  the  optical  properties  of  the
substrate.      Semiconductor   wafer   surfaces,   such   as
unpatterned  polished,  epitaxial,  or  film  layers,  have
different  optical  properties.    The  wafers  must  meet  the
dimensional    requirements    of    SEMI    M1    for    the
appropriate  nominal  wafer  diameter  and  must  be  laser
marked  in  a  manner  agreed  upon  between  supplier  and
user.
8. 2  Range  of  Calibration  Diameters  ó  Choose  the
diameters  of  the  PSL  spheres  so  that  the  measurement
range  for  the  intended  application  is  covered.    Use
spheres of size ranging from the largest measurable size
down  to  a  size  with  an  estimated  capture  rate  less  than
50%.    Do  not  exceed  the  dynamic  range  of  the  SSIS
channel   being   calibrated.      Use   sufficient   sphere
diameters to achieve the required 5% PSL sphere sizing
accuracy  of  the  response  curve  between  calibration
points  using  a  calibration  curve  that  is  produced  by
fitting  the  calibration  points.    In  the  absence  of  other
criteria,    choose    spheres    with    diameter    ratios    of
approximately 1.7.
8. 2.1    To  accomplish  the  accuracy  check  (see  Section
10. 4.2), choose an additional set of PSL spheres of size


SEMI M53-1103 © SEMI 2003 6
approximately  midway  between  adjacent  pairs  of  the
original set.
8. 3  Background Contamination
8. 3.1  Handle and store reference wafers with great care
to avoid contamination and damage.
8. 3.2    Establish  that  the  bell-shaped  peaks  in  the  SSIS
LLS  histogram  of  each  reference  wafer  to  be  used,
which  are  generated  from  the  PSL  sphere  depositions,
are  well  defined  and  well  above  the  background  level
over all of the response curve except near the threshold.
Also   verify   that   each   unimodal   bell-shaped   curve
extends to less than 50% of its peak value on both sides
of  the  peak  within  a  diameter  range  of  ±  15%  of  the
PSL sphere diameter at the peak  of  the  distribution.    If
the  deposition  on  any  reference  wafer  fails  either  of
these criteria, obtain a new reference wafer.
NOTE  3:  In  most  cases,  the  LLS  histogram  peaks  are  wider
than the actual deposition diameter distributions.  See Related
Information 1 for more details.
8. 4  Data   to   Accompany   Reference   Wafers   ó   A
certificate    with    the    following    information    must
accompany each reference wafer.
8. 4.1  For each CRM on the reference wafer provide:
8. 4.1.1        The    deposition    peak    diameter    and    the
uncertainty in accordance with the requirements of Row
3. 3 of Table 3 of SEMI M52.
8. 4.1.2    The  maximum  possible  value  of  the  deposition
diameter  distribution  full  width  at  half  max  (FWHM)

9  Procedure
9. 1        Set    up    the    SSIS    in    accordance    with    the
manufacturer's instructions for the wafer diameter, sizes
of  PSL  spheres,  and  other  machine  conditions  to  be
used  during  the  calibration  procedure.    Ensure  that
machine  conditions  are  identical  with  those  to  be  used
in examining wafers with the calibrated SSIS.
9. 2    Ensure  that  the  SSIS  is  operating  properly  for  the
selected machine conditions.

from curve fits to the histograms from each deposition.
10. 3  Associate   each   peak   value   of   reported   SSIS
signals determined in Section 10.2 to the certified value
of PSL sphere diameter for that CRM deposited on that
reference wafer.
10. 4  Create and check the SSIS response curve.
10. 4.1  To obtain the SSIS response curve make a fit to
the  set  of  peak  values  in  such  a  manner  that  the
response  to  PSL  sphere  deposition  CRMs  that  size
between    calibration    points    meets    the    uncertainty
requirements of SEMI M52.
10. 4.2      Check   the   accuracy   of   the   resulting   SSIS
response   curve   by   either   measuring   PSL   sphere
deposition   CRMs   with   locations   mid-way   between
calibration  points,  or  by  comparison  to  a  modeled
result, or both.
10. 4.3    If  necessary  repeat  the  curve  fitting  procedure
until the required accuracy is met.
10. 5  Use this fitted response curve to establish the LSE
size  of  localized  light  scatterers  with  any  particular
machine response value.

RELATED INFORMATION 1
DEPOSITION ISSUES
NOTICE:    This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  M53  and  was  derived  from  the  work  of  the
Automated Wafer Surface Inspection Task Force.  This related information was approved for publication by full
letter ballot on November 22, 2002.
R1-1.1 Both this practice and SEMI M52 introduce the
notion   that   SSIS   calibration   should   depend   on   the
characteristics of PSL sphere depositions as they appear
on   the   reference   wafers,   rather   than   the   previous
technique  of  using  the  bulk  characteristics  of  the  PSL
spheres measured prior to being deposited.  This change
in philosophy has come about for two reasons.  First, in
many  situations,  there  is  actually  some  advantage  to
creating  depositions  with  different  characteristics  from
those  of  the  bulk  PSL  spheres.    For  example,  the
deposition process may be used to narrow the diameter
distribution  thus  creating  a  standard  that  more  closely
approximates  a  source  of  particles  of  a  single  known
size.    Secondly,  most  deposition  systems  produce  at
least  minor  changes  in  diameter  distributions  that  are
difficult  to  eliminate  in  any  case.    As  a  result,  this
philosophical change is being introduced to increase the
accuracy    with    which    SSIS    calibration    can    be
accomplished.
R1-1.2   Deposition   systems   generally   consist   of   an
atomizer   (which   takes   the   particles   from   a   liquid
suspension  to  an  air  droplet  mist),  followed  by  a  dryer
(so  that  droplets  of  the  source  liquid  do  not  reach  the
wafer),   and   often   include   a   bipolar   charger   and
differential  mobility  analyzer  (or  DMA)  to  size  and/or
filter the particles.  The changes in characteristics from
source  to  deposition  are  due  to  at  least  three  distinct
causes.    First,  virtually  all  atomizers  bias  the  diameter
distribution  slightly  in  favor  of  smaller  particles.    This
is because the larger particles do not ìfitî in the smaller
droplets  and  as  a  result  have  a  smaller  probability  of
ending  up  in  the  airborne  stream  of  particles  headed
towards the wafer.  For narrow source distributions this
is   not   much   of   an   issue,   but   for   wider   source
distributions  it  is.    Secondly,  the  source  liquid  often
contains   non-volatile   solids   that   may   dry   onto   the
particles,    thus    slightly    changing    their    diameter.
Although  this  is  not  as  important  for  larger  particles
greater  than  200  nm,  it  is  highly  recommended  that  a
PSL  suspension  with  low  non-volatiles  be  used  to
reduce this source of error.  If the DMA is operated in a
manner  that  meets  the  requirement  of  this  practice  for
distributions with full width at half maximum (FWHM)
of no more than 5% of the  peak  diameter,  then  many
source distributions are narrowed by the DMA.  This is
true  because  many  PSL  sphere  sources  with  diameters
less than 200 nm have FWHM values wider than 5% of
peak  value.    The  5%  FWHM  value  does  not  impose
severe difficulties on the DMA design.
R1-1.3      In   addition   to   narrowing   the   deposition
diameter  distributions,  these  standards  address  related
accuracy   issues.      These   are   easily   understood   by
considering  the  filtering  process  of  the  DMA  on  the
source  distribution  as  shown  in  Figure  R1-1.    The  left
hand  side  of  the  figure  represents  a  rather  broad  PSL
source  diameter  distribution.    Notice  that  it  is  not
symmetrical,   which   makes   the   mean   (or   average)
diameter  different  from  the  modal  (or  peak)  diameter.
Typically  PSL  manufacturers  have  given  the  mean
diameter  with  their  product  and  industry  users  have
assigned  this  value  as  the  diameter  for  that  deposition.
Unfortunately  depositions  are  generally  made  at  the
peak diameter.  This is because the peak is easily found
by  scanning  the  DMA  through  the  source  distribution
while  counting  the  number  of  particles  passing  the
DMA.  The center section of the figure shows the ideal
triangular  transfer  function  of  the  DMA  fixed  at  some
center  diameter.    By  adjusting  airflows  through  the
DMA,  the  FWHM  can  be  changed.    By  adjusting  an
applied voltage, the center pass diameter of the transfer
function  can  be  changed.    In  effect,  the  deposition
characteristics are formed through the multiplication of
the  transfer  function  with  the  source  distribution  as
indicated on the right hand side of the figure.
R1-1.4   Notice   that   the   shape   of   the   deposition
distribution  is  triangular  with  bowed  in  sides,  because
the  source  distribution  is  not  flat.    In  effect,  this  is  a
safety factor for the 5% FWHM specification.  Because
the  source  distribution  is  not  necessarily  symmetrical,
the  deposition  distribution  may  not  be  either;  however,
the  mean  and  peak  deposition  diameters  will  be  very
close because the distribution is relatively narrow.


SEMI M53-1103 © SEMI 2003 10
R1-1.5  The accuracy of the peak diameter, which is specified to have a relative expanded uncertainty at about 95%
confidence  level  as  small  as  possible  but  not  greater  than  3%  in  SEMI  M52,  is  determined  by  either  the  accuracy
with  which  the  peak  source  diameter  is  known  (or  can  be  found),  or  by  the  accuracy  of  the  DMA  sweep
voltage/diameter  relationship.    Unfortunately  many  PSL  source  bottles  currently  in  use  do  not  give  the  peak
diameter,  so  this  presents  a  difficulty  for  the  first  approach.    The  second  approach,  relying  on  DMA  voltage
accuracy, can be checked by using PSL sources that are known to be very narrow (to minimize differences between
source and deposition peak diameter) with very accurate peak values.

GUIDE FOR SEMI-INSULATING (SI) GaAs MATERIAL PARAMETERS
This  guide  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Compound  Semiconductor  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility of the European Compound Semiconductor Materials Committee.  Current edition approved by
the  European  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  January  9,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org
February 2004; to be published March 2004. Originally published March 2003.
1  Purpose
1. 1      Substrates   with   high   electrical   resistivity   and
electron  drift  mobility  are  needed  to  fabricate  high
performance digital and analog microelectronic devices
and circuits.  Semi-insulating n-type Gallium Arsenide,
henceforth   termed   SI   GaAs,   has   been   established
worldwide  as  a  preferred  substrate  material  for  such
applications.
1. 2    The  active  layers  needed  for  devices  are  generated
either by ion implantation or by epitaxy.  The quality of
these  layers,  and  hence  the  performance,  yield  and
reliability of devices, strongly depends on the bulk and
surface quality of the substrate.
1. 3    This  document  provides  a  basis  for  specifying  the
material  parameters  of  SI  GaAs  to  support  ordering
agreements between suppliers and purchasers.
2  Scope
2. 1  This document defines and describes the electrical,
optical,  structural,  and  surface  properties  of  SI  GaAs
that are considered technically relevant according to the
present   status   of   scientific   knowledge   and   material
technology.
2. 2    A  specification  of  the  material  quality  of  SI  GaAs
substrates    includes    a    number   of   the   parameters
described    below.        Depending    on    the    intended
application,   a   particular   subset   of   properties   and
respective parameters will be considered relevant by the
purchaser.
2. 3    In  order  to  enhance  the  clarity  and  applicability  of
the  document,  the  ordering  information  in  Section  6
subdivides  the  material  parameters  in  respect  of  their
relative   importance,   according   to   general   industry
perception.
2. 4    Some  material  properties  and  parameters,  while
intensively  discussed  in  the  technical  literature,  are
insufficiently   established   to   allow   an   unambiguous
specification.  The available information is nevertheless
included  to  support  supplier-purchaser  discussions  and
agreements on these issues.
2. 5  Each parameter specification requires an agreement
about    verification.        Appropriate    information    is
summarized   in   Section   5.      Available   standard   test
methods  elaborated  by  SEMI,  ASTM,  and  DIN  are
referenced in Section 3.
2. 6  A number of the required standard test methods do
not exist at present.  This document is expected to serve
as  a  guideline  and  incentive  for  qualified  ASTM,  DIN,
JEITA,  and  SEMI  committees  to  develop  the  missing
standard  procedures.    Conversely,  if  at  present  more
than  one  standard  test  method  for  verification  of  a
specific   parameter   exists   (see   Table   1),   a   global
consensus  procedure  towards  selecting  or  generating  a
unique standard is advocated.
2. 7    The  geometrical  properties  of  wafers,  in  particular
orientation,   diameter,   thickness,   flatness   and   edge
rounding,   are   covered   by   the   series   of   SEMI   M9
specifications and shall not be addressed here.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

4  SI GaAs
4. 1    SI  GaAs  as  described  in  this  specification  has  n-
type  conductivity  and  an  electrical  resistivity  ρ  in  the
range  1 × 10
6
– 5 × 10
8
Ωcm.  It  is  characterized  by
fabrication procedures and material properties.
4. 2      Synthesis   of   the   compound   GaAs   from   the
elements gallium (Ga) and arsenic (As) may be done
• in the crystal growth chamber immediately prior to
growth (in-situ synthesis)
• in   separate   equipment,   independent   of   crystal
growth (ex-situ synthesis)
4. 3  The growth of SI GaAs single crystals involves one
of the following procedures:
• Liquid Encapsulated Czochralski (LEC)

www.din.de
• LEC with controlled As vapor pressure (VCZ)
• Vertical Gradient Freeze (VGF)
• Vertical Bridgman (VB)
4. 4    SI  GaAs  single  crystal  ingots  are  thermally  treated
after  crystal  growth.    The  annealing  procedures  are
defined by heating rates, hold temperatures, hold times
and cooling rates.  Single step ingot annealing (one hold
time  at  one  temperature)  or  multi  step  ingot  annealing
(several  hold  times  at  different  temperatures)  may  be
applied.  Wafers may be treated similarly by single step
wafer annealing and multi step wafer annealing.
4. 5    SI  GaAs  contains  the  intrinsic  double  donor  point
defect  EL2,  which  involves  an  As  atom  on  a  Ga  site
(As
Ga
).    At  room  temperature  the  first  ionization  level
EL2
0
/EL2
+
is approximately at ∆E = 0.69 eV below the
conduction band.  The concentration [EL2
0
] of the neu-
tral defect is in the range of 5 × 10
15
to 3 × 10
16
cm
-3
.
4. 6      SI   GaAs   contains   unintentionally   incorporated
impurities   acting   as   donors.      It   may   also   contain
intrinsic  donor  defects  other  than  EL2.    The  total
concentration  [D]  of  donors  other  than  EL2  should  be
low  for  optimal  control  of  ion  implantation  activation
and high electron mobility μ (see Section 4.12).
4. 7  SI GaAs contains impurities acting as acceptors.  It
may also contain intrinsic acceptor defects.  Usually the
total  concentration  [A]  of  acceptors  is  adjusted  by
controlled    incorporation    of    carbon    (C)    in    the
concentration range [C] 4 × 10
14
cm
-3
– 2 × 10
16
cm
-3
.
4. 8      SI   GaAs   contains   extrinsic   and   intrinsic   point
defects  that  do  not  participate  in  the  compensation
process  (see  Sections  4.10  and  4.11).    These  defects
may    be    isoelectronic    centers    (e.g.    boron    (B)
incorporated  on  the  Ga  site,  B
Ga
)  or  extremely  deep
donors and acceptors below and above the Fermi level,
respectively.    They  may  influence  the  material  quality,
for  instance  by  degrading  the  activation  efficiency  of
implanted dopants or by acting as transient carrier traps
and nonradiative recombination centers (NRRC).
4. 9    SI  GaAs  generally  is  nonstoichometric,  containing
excess   As   with   a   concentration   of   the   order   of
10
18
cm
-3
.    The  excess  As  is  partly  incorporated  as
lattice  antisite  defects  (As
Ga
),  see  Section  4.5.    Other
forms of point defect incorporation (e.g. interstitial As)
are  likely,  but  have  not  been  positively  identified.
Excess As is attracted by dislocations (see Section 4.13)
and  is  concentrated  along  these,  forming  decoration
precipitates.    Precipitates  may  also  be  generated  away
from  dislocations,  e.g.  in  the  inner  part  of  dislocation
cells (see Section 4.14).  They are referred to as matrix
precipitates  and  are  generally  smaller  than  dislocation
precipitates.  The concentration and size of precipitates


SEMI M54-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 3
strongly    depend    on    the    post    growth    annealing
procedures (see Section 4.4).
4. 10      To   obtain   SI   GaAs,   complete   ionization   of
shallow   donors   and   acceptors   and   partial   single
ionization of EL2 must be achieved, requiring that
[EL2]   >   [A] - [D]   > 0 (1)
The  Fermi  level  is  then  pinned  approximately  at  ∆E
below the conduction band.
4. 11  The resistivity of SI GaAs is given by
ρ = (e [n] μ

+ e [p] μ

)

4. 12    Due  to  ionized  impurity  scattering  μ  decreases
with the concentration [I] of ionized centers, given by
[I]  =  2 [A]  =  2 ( [EL2
+
] + [D]

). (7)
Relations  (3)  and  (7)  imply  that  μ  decreases  with
increasing resistivity.  Relation (7) further implies that,
for a given resistivity, low [D] is desirable to maximize
μ.
4. 13      SI   GaAs   ingots   usually   contain   dislocations
generated  by  thermal  stress  during  crystal  growth  and
postgrowth  annealing.    The  dislocation  density  (DD),
although  a  volume  property,  is  evaluated  by  measuring
the  area  density  of  dislocations  threading  a  substrate
surface.  Structural etching with molten KOH generates
characteristically   shaped   etch   pits   at   the   threading
points.    Hence  the  DD  is  characterized  by  quoting  the
etch pit density (EPD).
4. 14    Depending  on  the  growth  method  and  the  ingot
diameter, the EPD may vary from essentially zero up to
2 × 10
5
cm
-2
.  The lateral variation of the EPD generally
forms   a   pattern   of   globular   dislocation-free   “cells”
surrounded  by  high  DD  “walls”.    The  cell  dimensions
are on the order of 100 μm ∅ for LEC grown material
and about an order of magnitude larger for VGF grown
material.
4. 15  State-of-the-art SI GaAs substrates do not contain
polycrystalline structure or twins.
4. 16        The    intensity    of    band-to-band    and    shallow
donor/acceptor-related  radiative  carrier  recombination
luminescence  depends  on  the  minority  carrier  lifetime,
which  in  turn  is  related  to  the  distribution  of  NRRCs.
These  centers  are  generally  believed  to  be  intrinsic
defects  and  appear  to  have  a  minor  influence  on  the
electrical properties.
4. 17    The  quality  of  the  front  surface  of  the  wafer  is
mainly  determined  by  global  and  local  flatness  (not
addressed  here  in  detail),  surface  contamination,  light
point   defect   (LPD)
3
density   and   micro-roughness
(haze).    Other  surface  irregularities  to  be  considered  in
a supplier-purchaser agreement include stain, scratches,
pits, orange peel and dimples as defined in SEMI M10.
4. 18    The  thickness  and  structure  of  the  oxide  on  the
surface  of  SI  GaAs  wafers  to  be  used  for  epitaxy  may
be prepared to allow layer deposition without chemical
pre-cleaning   by   the   user.      Generally   this   material
property is guaranteed for a certain time interval only.
5  Parameter Verification
5. 1  The material specification of SI GaAs according to
Section    6    requires    agreements    on    specification
verification.      Existing   standard   test   methods   are
suggested and referenced in Section 3.
5. 2      If   a   standard   test   method   is   not   available,
alternative  verification  methods  are  recommended  and
described      in      order      to      identify      practicable
characterization   procedures   that   are   consonant   with
industry practice and cost considerations.
5. 3    Some  characterization  methods,  while  intensively
used   for   exploratory   material   investigations,   yield
qualitative    information    only    and    are,    therefore,
inadequate  for  a  specification  verification.    They  are
nevertheless  included,  with  appropriate  comment,  to
ensure   comprehensiveness   of   this   guideline   and   to
facilitate respective supplier-purchaser agreements.


3 For silicon wafers, and sometimes for GaAs, the acronym LLS
(localized light scatterer) is used.


SEMI M54-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 4
5. 4    The  concentration  of  C  incorporated  on  the  As
lattice    site,    [C
AS
],    is    measured    using    the    local
vibrational   mode   (LVM)   absorption   with   Fourier
Transform  Infrared  Spectroscopy  (FTIR).    Presently
two standard test methods (SEMI M30 and DIN 50449-
1)  are  available.    SEMI  M30  is  valid  for  measurement
at  room  temperature  and  [C]  >  10
15
cm
-3
.    It  requires
individual    instrument    calibration    with    a    set    of
secondary  reference  samples.    DIN  50449-1  defines
standardized    FTIR    measurement    parameters    and
calibration     factors     for     measurement     at     room
temperature  and  at  77K,  the  latter  having  a  detection
limit   [C]   ≥   10
13
cm
3
.      For   practically   relevant
concentrations (see Section 4.7) there is no evidence for
carbon  incorporation  other  than  on  the  As  lattice  site.
Hence the calibration factors quoted in SEMI M30 and
DIN  50449-1  imply  that  [C]  =  [C
As
].    The  results
obtained  when  using  the  two  standard  test  methods
presently  are  conflicting,  hence  a  harmonizing  activity
is considered necessary.
5. 5  The  electrical  resistivity ρ  can  be  evaluated  with
contacting    and    noncontacting    techniques.        The
contacting  van  der  Pauw  measurement  is  performed
according  to  ASTM  F76  or  SEMI  M39,  the  latter
specifically  addressing  the  measurement  of  SI  GaAs.
The   noncontacting   measurement   using   a   capacitive
probe  is  performed  according  to  DIN  50448.    This
technique  enables  measurement  of  lateral  variations  of
ρ.    Resistivity  will  be  quoted  for  an  agreed  standard
temperature;      296K      (23°C)      is      recommended.
Measurements  done  at  a  different  temperature  must  be
normalized  to  the  standard  temperature  as  described  in
Section 4.11.  The difference between the standard and
measurement temperatures must not exceed 5°C.
5. 6  The electron mobility μ is measured using the Hall
effect and a van der Pauw structure.  The evaluation is
performed according to ASTM F76 or SEMI M39.
5. 7  The etch pit density (EPD) of LEC grown SI GaAs
is evaluated according to ASTM F1404 or DIN 50454-

# 1

1.    The  documents  describe  the  etching  procedure  and
define  test  location  plans  linked  to  the  crystallographic
axes.
5. 8  The EPD of VGF, VCZ and VB grown SI GaAs is
10
4
cm
-2
or   below.      The   evaluation   is   performed
according  to  DIN  50454-1  or  SEMI  M36.    The  test
locations are defined by a fixed grid (SEMI M36) or by
an    adaptable    grid    generated    by    a    standardized
procedure  (DIN  50454-1).    Guidelines  are  given  to
assess the lateral variation of EPD.
5. 9    The  light  point  defect  (LPD)  density  is  a  measure
for the density of surface irregularities that are above a
certain  size  limit  (usually  300  nm  in  diameter).    These
irregularities  may  be  foreign  material  deposited  on  the
wafer surface (particles) or so-called crystal originating
pits      (COPs)      caused      by      volume      material
inhomogeneities  generated  during  the  growth  and/or
annealing    procedures    and    can    be    revealed    by
application  of  a  light  scattering  technique.    Depending
on  the  mechano-chemical  polishing  processes  and  the
light scattering technique employed, COPs may or may
not be observed.  At present no standard test method for
LPD  evaluation  is  available.    Therefore,  a  supplier-
purchaser  agreement  on  e.g.  the  used  measurement
system,   size   restriction   procedure,   edge   exclusion,
inclusion   or   exclusion   of   COPs   is   necessary.      To
exclude an influence of different measuring systems the
size of LPD’s should be given in units of diameter, not
of a scattering cross section.
5. 10    The  concentration  of  the  neutral  double  donor
[EL2
0
] is measured using the optical absorption at about
1 μm.  An absolute determination is impossible because
neither  a  generally  accepted  calibration  standard  nor  a
standardized   test   procedure   is   presently   available
4
.
Hence  a  supplier-purchaser  agreement  is  necessary  to
ensure reproducibility.  The relative lateral variation of
[EL2
0
]   can   be   quantitatively   assessed   with   high
precision.   The   evaluation   of   [EL2
+
]   using   optical
absorption is presently considered unreliable.
5. 11    The  total  concentration  of  impurities  acting  as
donors is measured by Spark Source or Glow Discharge
Mass  Spectroscopy  (SSMS,  GDMS).    The  dominant
contributions  are  Si,  S,  O,  and  Te.    The  analytical
procedure  is  time-consuming  and  costly,  hence  it  is
generally     confined     to     e.g.     biannual     control
measurements   of   the   supplier   to   ensure   that   raw
material     supply,     synthesis     and     crystal     growth
procedures  are  stable.  By  virtue  of  the  compensation
process (see Section 4.11) the donor concentration [D],
including  intrinsic  defects,  is  implicitly  controlled  by
specifying [C], [EL2] and ρ.
5. 12    The  total  concentration  of  impurities  acting  as
acceptors   is   measured   by   SSMS   or   GDMS.      The
analytical   procedure   is   time-consuming   and   costly,
hence    is    generally    confined    to    regular    control
measurements   of   the   supplier   to   ensure   that   raw
material  supply  and  the  synthesis  and  crystal  growth
procedures   are   stable.      The   dominant   contribution
usually is C, intentionally doped to control ρ.  Hence it
is    generally    sufficient    to    verify    that    the    total
concentration  of  acceptor  impurities  other  than  C  is
small compared to [C].
5. 13    The  concentration  of  B  is  measured  using  the
local  vibrational  mode  (LVM)  absorption  according  to
DIN   50449-2.      Established,   but   non-standardized


4  A DIN standard test method to measure [EL2] is in preparation and
is scheduled for publication in 2002.


SEMI M54-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 5
methods  include  GDMS,  SSMS,  Secondary  Ion  Mass
Spectroscopy      (SIMS)      and      atomic      absorption
spectroscopy (AAS).
5. 14  Surface contaminants are identified and quantified
with   Time-of-Flight-SIMS   (TOF-SIMS)   and   Total
Reflection  X-Ray  Fluorescence  (TXRF).    The  latter
technique is difficult to apply for impurities with atomic
weight below those of the matrix elements Ga and As.
5. 15  Deposition of high quality epitaxial layers without
chemical  pre-cleaning  depends  on  the  surface  oxide
structure of the substrate, as prepared by the supplier, as
well  as  the  thermal  oxide  desorption  and  the  epitaxial
deposition  procedures  of  the  purchaser.    Hence  an
individual   supplier-purchaser   specific   evaluation   is
necessary.    Test  epitaxy  followed  by  layer  quality
assessment is recommended.
5. 16    The  lateral  substrate  homogeneity  is  assessed  by
automated    analytic    instrumentation    elaborated    to
generate   topographic   images   of   important   material
parameters,     including     electrical     resistivity,     EL2
concentration,   EPD   and   minority   carrier   lifetime.
Macroscopic    (e.g.    radial)    variations    as    well    as
mesoscopic  fluctuations  (generally  correlated  to  the
cellular  dislocation  structure)  may  be  assessed.    Such
topographic   analysis   is   provided,   respectively,   by
contactless   capacitive   resistivity   mapping   (see   DIN
50448),  EL2  absorption  topography  (see  footnote  3),
specular       light       reflection       topography       and
photoluminescence    topography.        The    first    three
topography    techniques    provide    quantitative    data.
Photoluminescence     topography     gives     qualitative
homogeneity      information      only,      because      the
interrelations  between  the  luminescence  intensity  and
the  various  radiative  and  nonradiative  recombination
processes  are  only  partially  understood.    The  details  of
the  topographic  measurements,  i.e.  lateral  resolution
and  edge  exclusion,  must  be  defined  by  individual
supplier-purchaser agreement.
5. 17    As  precipitates,  other  inclusions  and  voids  are
visualized  with  light  scattering  tomography  (LST).    At
present  it  is  not  possible  to  differentiate  between  these
scattering centers and to obtain quantitative information
concerning  their  concentration  and  size.    Hence  LST
images provide a qualitative information only.
5. 18  Micro-roughness,   also   referred   to   as   haze,   is
indicated by a diffuse reflection of collimated, laterally
extended  high  intensity  illumination  from  the  wafer
surface.      Localized   haze   and   haze   observed   on
particular   wafers   of   a   batch   indicate   potentially
disadvantageous  variations  of  surface  quality.    The
agreement should specify the conditions of observation
(e.g. illumination intensity).
5. 19  Surface irregularities (stain, scratches, pits, orange
peel,    dimples)    are    identified    by    high    intensity
illumination   or   by   standard   and   phase   sensitive
(Nomarski)   microscopy.      Individual   agreement   is
recommended concerning the permitted surface density
of these defects.
6  Ordering Information
6. 1  The  material  properties of  SI  GaAs  substrates,  as
described  in  Section  4,  are  addressed  in  the  ordering
agreement   using   the   tables   given   below.      The
subdivisions  into  “important”,  “optional”  and  “other”
specifications   are   suggested   only,   i.e.   supplier   and
purchaser  may  agree  on  an  individual  choice,  taking
into  account  the  respective  application  as  well  as  cost
considerations.
6. 2        In    addition    to    specifying    individual    material
properties  as  listed  below,  the  purchase  order  may
specify the fabrication procedures according to Sections
4. 2 and 4.3.
6. 3    Substrates  are  usually  delivered  in  batches.    The
batch   homogeneity   is   defined   in   the   purchasing
agreement  by  variation  ranges  of  specified  parameters.
The ordering agreement shall also state whether batches
must  originate  from  one  ingot  or  may  be  assembled
from  several  specified  or  unspecified  ingots.    In  either
case   the   supplier   guarantees   compliance   with   the
specified  batch  homogeneity  by  control  of  fabrication
technology and appropriate test sample evaluations.
6. 4    Table  1  lists  the  parameters  that  are  considered
important to  specify  the  material  quality  of  SI  GaAs
substrates.    The  level  of  importance  may  be  adjusted
individually by taking into account the intended use for
implantation  or  epitaxy.    The  quoted  absolute  values
suggest   a   customary   material   specification,   to   be
adopted  unless  individual  considerations  warrant  other
choices.
6. 5  Table 2 lists optional parameters that are important
for specific applications only, hence may or may not be
considered  relevant  for  a  particular  supplier/purchaser
agreement.  For  most  of  these  parameters,  standard  test
methods at present do not exist.
6. 6    Table  3  lists  other  parameters  which  in  general
need not be specified, but are addressed for clarification
and to provide a basis for agreement in the event that a
purchaser  desires  to  include  such  parameters  into  a
purchasing specification.

SEMI M55-0705
SPECIFICATION FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICON
CARBIDE WAFERS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Compound  Semiconductor  Committee  and  is  the
direct  responsibility  of  the  European  Compound  Semiconductor  Materials  Committee.    Current  edition
approved  by  the  European  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  January  8,  2003.    Initially  available  at
www.semi.org January 2003; to be published March 2003.
NOTICE:    The  designation  of  SEMI  M55  was  updated  during  the  0705  publishing  cycle  to  reflect  the
creation of SEMI M55.2.
1  Purpose
1. 1  These  specifications  cover  substrate  requirements  for  monocrystalline  high-purity  silicon  carbide  wafers  of
crystallographic polytype 6H and 4H used in semiconductor and electronic device manufacturing.
2  Scope
2. 1  A  complete  purchase  specification  may  require  that  additional  physical,  electrical,  and  bulk  properties  be
defined.  These properties are listed, together with test methods suitable for determining their magnitude where such
procedures are documented.
2. 2  These  specifications  are  directed  specifically  to  silicon  carbide  wafers  with  one  or  both  sides  polished.
Unpolished  wafers  or  wafers  with  epitaxial  films  are  not  covered;  however,  purchasers  of  such  wafers  may  find

4  Terminology
NOTE 1:   Many definitions and terms not given in this section can be found in SEMI M1, the SEMI Compilation of Terms, and
ASTM F154.
4. 1  Definitions
4. 1.1  bow ⎯  of  a  semiconductor  wafer,  a  measure  of  concave  or  convex  deformation  of  the  median  surface  of  a
wafer, independent of any thickness variation which may be present.  Bow is a bulk property of the test specimen,
not  a  property  of  an  exposed  surface.  Generally,  bow  is  determined  with  a  test  specimen  in  a  free,  unclamped
condition.  Units of bow are generally micrometers.
4. 1.2  crystallite — any part of the wafer, having an arbitrary orientation of its crystallographic axis in respect to the
monocrystalline part of the wafer.
4. 1.3  dopant ⎯ a chemical element, usually from the third or fifth column of the periodic table for the case of IV-
IV  compounds,  incorporated  in  trace  amounts  in  a  semiconductor  crystal  to  establish  its  conductivity  type  and
resistivity.
4. 1.4  edge  contouring ⎯  on  wafers  whose  edges  have  been  shaped  by  mechanical  and/or  chemical  means,  a
description of the profile of the boundary of the wafer joining the front and back sides.
4. 1.5  edge  exclusion ⎯  the  width  X  of  a  narrow  band  of  wafer  surface,  located  just  inside  the  wafer  edge,  over
which the values of the specified parameter do not apply.  See definition of fixed quality area below.
4. 1.6  fixed quality area (FQA) — The central area of a wafer surface, defined by a nominal edge exclusion, X, over
which the specified values of a parameter apply.
4. 1.6.1  Discussion — The boundary of the FQA is at all points the distance X away from the periphery of a wafer of
nominal  dimensions.    (See  Figure  1.)    The  size  of  the  FQA  is  independent  of  wafer  diameter  and  flat  length
tolerances.
4. 1.7  lot ⎯  for  the  purpose  of  this  document,  (a)  all  of  the  wafers  of  nominally  identical  size  and  characteristics
contained in a single shipment, or (b) subdivisions of large shipments consisting of wafers as above which have been
identified by the supplier as constituting a lot.
4. 1.8  micropipe ⎯  small  hollow  tube  approximately  parallel  to  the  crystallographic  c-axis  and  extending  through
the whole crystal.
4. 1.9  orthogonal  misorientation ⎯  in  {0001}  wafers  cut  intentionally  “off-orientation”,  the  angle  between  the
projection  of  the  vector  normal  to  the  wafer  surface  onto  the  {0001}  plane  and  the  projection  on  that  plane  of  the
specified direction of tilt in the {0001} plane.  (See Figure 2.)
4. 1.10  planar  defect
⎯  small  cavity  in  a  SiC  bulk  crystal  with  large  width-to-height  ratio  roughly  parallel  to  the
{0001}  lattice  plane.    The  lateral  boundaries  are  parallel  to  crystallographic  directions.    Often  one  or  more
micropipes are connected to a planar defect.
4. 1.11  polytype ⎯  one  possible  crystallographic  modification  of  a  substance  which  shows  the  phenomenon  of
polytypism.    All  polytypes  of  a  substance  have  the  same  lattice  layers  with  nearly  the  same  lattice  constant  in
common.    However  the  stacking  sequence  of  these  layers  differs  between  different  polytypes.    Most  commonly
polytypes are named after a suggestion of Ramsdell
6
:  A symbol like 6H gives the number of layers in one periodic
stacking sequence (2, 3, 4, ... ) and the symmetry of the resulting crystal (H = hexagonal, R = rhombohedral). The
most common polytypes of SiC are 6H, 4H, 15R.
4. 1.12  surface orientation ⎯ the tilt angle between the crystallographic c-axis and the wafer surface normal. (See
Figure 2.)
4. 1.13  total  indicator  reading  (TIR)  —  the  smallest  perpendicular  distance  between  two  planes,  both  parallel  with
the reference plane, which encloses all points on the front surface of a wafer within the FQA, the site, or the subsite,
depending on which is specified.

SEMI M55-0705 © SEMI 2003, 2004 4
4. 1.14  total thickness variation (TTV) — the difference between the maximum and minimum thickness values of a
wafer  encountered  during  a  scan  pattern  or  a  series  of  point  requirements.    TTV  is  generally  expressed  in
micrometers.
4. 1.15  warp ⎯ of a semiconductor slice or wafer, the difference between the maximum and minimum distance of
the median surface of the wafer from a reference plane, encountered during a scan pattern.  Warp is a bulk property
of the test specimen, not a property of an exposed surface.  Warp is generally expressed in micrometers.

agreed upon between the supplier and the purchaser.


SEMI M55-0705 © SEMI 2003, 2004 5
8  Test Methods
NOTE 3:  SiC wafers are extremely fragile.  While the mechanical dimensions of a wafer can be measured by use of tools such as
micrometer calipers and other conventional techniques, the wafer may be damaged physically in ways that are not immediately
evident.  Special care must therefore be used in the selection and execution of measurement methods.
8. 1  Test Plan for Crystal Quality within One Crystal ⎯ Determine by a method agreed upon between the supplier
and purchaser.
NOTE 4:  The assessment of the crystal quality is a problem of great practical impact as it can be very time consuming and costly
or even impossible in the case of destructive test methods to test every wafer.  However in general crystal quality does not change
abruptly  in  a  crystal.    The  evaluation  of  a  subset  of  all  wafers  from  a  given  crystal  will  give  sufficient  information  about  the
quality of the whole crystal.
8. 2  Polytype ⎯  For  nominally  undoped  material  (n  <  10
17
/cm
3
)  determine  by  visual  inspection  at  77K  (liquid
nitrogen) under UV excitation.  For doped material (n > 10
17
/cm
3
) determine by visual inspection of the colors of the
doped material under diffuse lighting conditions.
8. 3  Diameter ⎯ Determine by ASTM Test Method F2074.
8. 4  Thickness, Center Point ⎯ Determine by ASTM Test Method F533.
8. 5  Flat Length ⎯ Determine by ASTM Test Method F671.
8. 6  Bow and Warp ⎯ Determine bow in accordance with ASTM Test Method F534 and warp in accordance with
ASTM Test Method F657.
NOTE 5:  ASTM  has  standardized  two  methods  for  measuring  warp.    ASTM  Test  Method  F1390  is  an  automated,  non-contact
method which provides for correction of the wafer deflection due to gravitational effects. The scan pattern covers the entire fixed
quality area.  ASTM Test Method F657 is a manual, non-contact method which has a continuous, prescribed scan pattern which
covers  only  a  portion  of  the  wafer  surface.    There  is  no  provision  for  correction  of  the  wafer  deflection  due  to  gravitational
effects. As noted in Appendix 2, different reference planes are used for the two methods.  Because Test Method F657 employs a
back surface reference plane, the measured warp may include contributions from thickness variation of the wafer.  Test Method
F1390  employs  a  median  surface  reference  plane  and  is  not  susceptible  to  interferences  from  thickness  variations.    In  general,
Test Method F1390 is preferred, especially for wafers 150 mm in diameter and larger.
8. 7  Total Thickness Variation ⎯ Determine by ASTM Test Method F657.
NOTE 6:  ASTM Test Method F533, DIN 50441/1 and JIS H 0611 are all 5 point methods, while Test Method F657 involves a
continuous  scan  pattern  over  a  portion  of  the  wafer  surface  and  Test  Method  F1530  involves  an  automated  continuous  scan
pattern  over  the  entire  wafer  surface.    JIS  H  0611  differs  from  ASTM  Test  Method  F533  and  DIN  50441/1,  in  that  the
measurements  in  JIS  H  0611  are  taken  at  the  center  and  at  5  mm  from  the  edge  on  diameters  parallel  and  perpendicular  to  the
primary orientation flat or notch bisector, while the measurements in ASTM Test Method F533 and DIN 50441/1 are taken at the
center  and  at  the  same  radial  distance  (R
nominal

-6  mm)  on  diameters  30°  and  120°  counterclockwise  from  the  bisector  to  the
primary orientation flat or notch (with the wafer facing front surface up).
8. 8  Surface Polarity ⎯ Determine by a method agreed upon between the supplier and the purchaser.
NOTE 7:  There are several destructive and non-destructive methods.  Most common examples are a chemical etch of the surface
(destructive), by comparing the differently reacting carbon and silicon faces, and wet oxidation (non-destructive) by comparing
the different growth rates on both surfaces by measuring the oxide layer thickness.
8. 9  Flat Orientation ⎯ Determine by ASTM Test Methods F847.
8. 10  Surface Orientation ⎯ Determine by ASTM Test Methods F26.
8. 11  Orthogonal Misorientation ⎯ Determined by a method agreed upon between the supplier and purchaser.
8. 12  Surface Defects and Contamination
8. 12.1  Visually  Observable  Surface  Defects ⎯  Determined  by  ASTM  Practice  F523  or  a  method  agreed  upon
between the supplier and purchaser.
8. 13  Edge Contour ⎯ Determine by ASTM Test Method F928.
8. 14  Resistivity ⎯ For conductive wafers determine by ASTM Test Method F43 or ASTM Test Method F673.  For
high-resistivity or semi-insulating material determine by DIN 50448.


SEMI M55-0705 © SEMI 2003, 2004 6
NOTE 8:  ASTM F43 is a four-point-probe technique whereas ASTM F673 is an inductive non-contact method. These methods
are limited to some 10
2
Ωcm.  DIN 50448 is a non-contact capacitive method suitable for the range 10
5
to 10
11
Ωcm.
8. 15  Etch Pit Density ⎯ Determine by ASTM Test Method F1404 or a method agreed upon between the supplier
and purchaser.
NOTE 9:  ASTM test method F1404 was intended only for use with gallium arsenide.  Nevertheless it should serve as a guideline
for determining the etch pit density of silicon carbide.
8. 16  Micropipe Density ⎯ Determine by a method agreed upon between the supplier and purchaser.
8. 17  Crystal Perfection ⎯ Determine by a method agreed upon between the supplier and purchaser.
9  Flat System
9. 1  For  silicon  carbide  wafers  with  the  surface  normal  close  to  the  crystallographic  c-axis  (small  tilt  angles,  see
Figure 2) one primary orientation flat and one secondary flat is specified.  The primary flat always has a greater flat
length compared to the secondary flat.  (See Figure 6.)
9. 2  The  angle  between  primary  and  secondary  flat  is  always  90°  (see  Figure  5).    For  the  tolerance  see  the
appropriate silicon carbide wafer standard.
9. 3  The  polarity  of  the  wafer  surfaces  is  indicated  by  the  relative  flat  positions  of  primary  and  secondary  flat  as
shown in Figure 5.
9. 4  The edge of the primary flat is always parallel to the [11-20] direction (or, which is the same, parallel to the (1-
100) lattice plane.)  For tolerances see the appropriate silicon carbide wafer standard.
9. 5  For the exact dimensions of the flat length and the tolerances see the appropriate silicon carbide wafer standard.
10  Standard Defect Limits
10. 1  Minimal  conditions  or  dimensions  for  surface  defects  are  stated  below.    These  limits  shall  be  used  for
determining wafer acceptability; anomalies smaller than these limits shall not be considered as defects.
10. 2  Surface Defects
10. 2.1  edge chip and indent — Any edge anomaly including saw exit marks conforming to the definition (ASTM
F154) and greater than 0.25 mm in radial depth and peripheral length.  (See Figure 7.)
10. 2.2  orange  peel  —  Any  visually  detectable  roughened  surface  conforming  to  the  definition  (ASTM  F154)  and
observable under diffused illumination.  Pits with a spacing of less than 2 mm are treated as orange peel.
10. 2.3  particles —  Distinct  particles  resting  on  the  surface  which  are  revealed  under  collimated  intense  light  as
bright points.
10. 2.4  pit —  Any  individually  distinguishable  depression  in  the  surface  with  a  length-to-width  ratio  smaller  than
5:1, visible when viewed under intense illumination.
NOTE 10:  This  definition  is  different  from  ASTM  F154  in  so  far  as  the  slope  of  the  sides  of  the  depression  are  not  taken  into
account.
10. 2.5  scratch  —  Any  anomaly  conforming  to  the  definition  (ASTM  F154)  and  having  a  length-to-width  ratio
greater than 5:1 and visible under intense illumination.
10. 3  Bulk Defects
10. 3.1  crack — Any anomaly conforming to the definition (ASTM F154) and greater than 0.25 mm in total length.
10. 3.2  crystallite — Any anomaly conforming to the definition (see §3) and having a misorientation of more than
1° to the main (monocrystalline) part of the wafer and having a maximum width larger than 0.20 mm.
10. 3.3  micropipe  —  Any  anomaly  conforming  to  the  definition  (see  §3)  and  visible  by  microscopic  inspection  in
transmission  mode  at  a  magnification  of  100×  or  after  etching  in  molten  KOH,  which  will  reveal  micropipes  as
hexagonal structures.


SEMI M55-0705 © SEMI 2003, 2004 7
NOTE 11:  For microscopic inspection the use of crossed polarisers is recommended.  However not all micropipes will be visible
under crossed polarisers.
10. 3.4  planar  defect  —  Any  anomaly  conforming  to  the  definition  (see  §3)  having  a  maximum  width  larger  than
0. 20 mm.
11  Certification
11. 1  Upon  request  of  the  purchaser  in  the  contract  or  order,  a  manufacturer’s  or  supplier’s  certification  that  the
material was manufactured and tested in accordance with this specification together, with a report of the test results,
shall be furnished at the time of shipment.
11. 2  In the interest of controlling inspection costs, the supplier and the purchaser may agree that the material shall
be certified as “capable of meeting” certain requirements.  In this context, “capable of meeting” shall signify that the
supplier is not required to perform the appropriate tests in §8.  However, if the purchaser performs the test and the
material fails to meet the requirement, the material may be subject to rejection.
12  Packing and Marking
12. 1  The wafers supplied under these specifications shall be identified by an individual laser marking consisting of
the supplier assigned lot-number on the backside of each wafer.  The laser marking consists of one line of characters
parallel to the primary flat and must be readable with unaided eye.  The top of the characters is directed towards the
wafer center.  All characters must be completely located within the marking window given in Figure 8.  For details
see the appropriate polished Silicon Carbide Wafer Standard.
NOTE 12:  SEMI  M12  is  a  standard  for  the  front  side  marking  of  silicon  wafers  and,  as  a  whole,  is  not  applicable  to  Silicon
Carbide  wafers.    It  is  referenced,  because  some  elements  of  SEMI  M12  (see  the  appropriate  polished  Silicon  Carbide  Wafer
Standard) shall also be used for Silicon Carbide.
12. 2  Special  packing  and  marking  requirements  shall  be  subject  to  agreement  between  the  supplier  and  the
purchaser.    Otherwise,  all  wafers  shall  be  handled,  inspected,  and  packed  in  such  a  manner  as  to  avoid  chipping,
scratches,  and  contamination  in  accordance  with  the  best  industry  practices  to  provide  ample  protection  against
damage during shipment.
12. 3  The  wafers  shall  be  identified  by  appropriately  labeling  the  outside  of  each  box  or  other  container  and  each
subdivision thereof in which it may reasonably be expected that the wafers will be stored prior to further processing.
Identification  shall  include  as  a  minimum  the  nominal  diameter,  conductive  dopant,  orientation,  resistivity  range,
and lot number.
12. 4  The lot number, either (1) assigned by the original manufacturer of the wafers, or (2) assigned subsequent to
slice  manufacture  but  providing  reference  to  the  original  lot  number,  shall  provide  easy  access  to  information
concerning the fabrication history of the particular wafers in that lot.  Such information shall be retained on file at
the manufacturer's facility for at least 10 years or as negotiated between vendor and user after that particular lot has
been accepted by the purchaser.

SPECIFICATION FOR 50.8 mm ROUND POLISHED
MONOCRYSTALLINE 4H AND 6H SILICON CARBIDE WAFERS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Compound  Semiconductor  Committee  and  is  the
direct  responsibility  of  the  European  Compound  Semiconductor  Materials  Committee.    Current  edition
approved  by  the  European  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  October  29,  2003.    Initially  available  at
www.semi.org January 2004; to be published March 2004.
NOTE 1:  This specification is intended to be a sub-document to SEMI M55, Specification For Polished Monocrystalline Silicon
Carbide Wafers.
1  Purpose
1. 1  This subordinate standard details the dimensional values and other information required for 50.8 mm polished
monocrystalline silicon carbide wafers.
2  Scope
2. 1  The complete specification for this product includes all  general  requirements  of  SEMI  M55,  Specification  For
Polished Monocrystalline Silicon Carbide Wafers.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1    The  backside  finish  properties,  dopant,  and  resistivity  are  not  addressed,  as  currently  these  properties  depend
strongly on the quick evolving technology and suitable limits for a standard do not exist.

be replaced by a unique definition.

PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR
METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY
AND BIAS
This   practice   was   technically   approved   by   the   Global   Silicon   Wafer   Committee   and   is   the   direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  September  3,  2003.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org
October 2003; to be published November 2003.
1  Purpose
1. 1      In   silicon   manufacturing   product   disposition   is
typically  contingent  on  metrology  equipment  output.
For   example,   a   piece   of   work   may   be   shipped,
scrapped,  or  reworked  based  on  information  from  one
or more measured output characteristics.  A cost model
provides    a    mechanism    for    estimating    the    costs
associated  with  operating  metrology  equipment  under
certain sets of assumptions and conditions.
1. 2    This  practice  provides  a  standard  methodology  for
metrology  equipment  suppliers  and  users  to  determine
the  cost  due  to  misclassification  of  product  because  of
measurement  variability  and  bias  during  testing  of  the
product for conformance to a specification.
1. 3    This  practice  is  intended  to  be  useful  for  pre-
purchase  evaluation  of  measurement  equipment  with
different  P/T  (Precision/Tolerance)  ratios.    It  is  also
intended  to  be  useful  when  comparing  the  operation  of
a     single     measurement     instrument     in     different
throughput  modes  where  P/T  ratio  changes  with  the
throughput  mode  utilized  or  other  equipment  setup
factors.  This practice can help users select the optimum
cost  solution  based  on  their  specific  process  capability
and requirements.
1. 4    Neither  traditional  cost  elements  (e.g.,  equipment,
maintenance, operational, and staffing cost) nor product
cost data are included in the practice; it is intended that
each  user  should  utilize  appropriate  data  based  on  the
applicable business model for the facility.
2  Scope
2. 1    This  practice  covers  a  methodology  to  determine
the  costs  associated  with  misclassification  of  product
due  to  variability  and  bias  of  measurement  equipment.
These  costs  are  associated  with  failing  product  that
conforms  with  specifications  and  passing  product  that
does not conform with specifications.
2. 2    This  practice  can  be  applied  to  make  relative  cost
comparisons between two or more measurement gauges
operating under conditions specified by the user.  These
conditions may include any aspects of the measurement
system  affecting  the  measurement  results  directly  or
indirectly (e.g., ambient conditions, throughput, recipe).
This  practice  can  also  be  used  to  compare  the  relative
costs  of  a  single  instrument  under  different  operating
conditions.
2. 2.1    A  measurement  gauge  is  defined  by  a  specific
realization of systems and subsystems required to make
measurements.  Gauges that differ in at least one system
or   subsystem   may   be   considered   different   for   the
purpose of comparison.
2. 3    This  practice  can  be  applied  to  any  metrology
equipment    or    to    the    metrology    portion    of    any
equipment that includes metrology.
2. 4      This   practice   covers   the   case   in   which   the
metrology  equipment  is  used  to  make  binary  decisions
about   the   item   being   measured,   that   is,   only   two
outcomes    are    possible    (e.g.,    pass/fail,    go/no-go,
ship/scrap).    Models  for  decisions  with  more  than  two
outcomes,  such  as  the  binning  of  data,  are  beyond  the
scope of this practice.
2. 5    To  apply  the  formulae  in  this  practice,  the  user
must  estimate  either  the  probability  density  function
(PDF) or cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the
process characteristic or characteristics of interest.  The
distributions can be based on a theoretical model or on
empirical   information   obtained   from   manufacturing
data.
2. 6    To  apply  the  formulae  in  this  practice,  the  user
must   be   able   to   estimate   all   biases   and   variances
associated  with  the  equipment  being  compared  under
the  specified  operating  conditions  and  with  respect  to
the  process  characteristic(s)  of  interest.    These  values
can  be  obtained  from  a  measurement  system  capability
analysis (see SEMI E89).
2. 7  To apply the methodology of this practice, the user
must    estimate    the    costs    of    classification    and
misclassification  due  to  decisions  made  as  a  result  of
measurements.    Estimates  of  such  costs  are  obtained
from    the    business    model    used    to    describe    the
manufacturing  process  in  which  the  measurements  are
performed.  Consequently, different users may arrive at
different  estimates  of  costs  because  their  computations
may contain different elements.


SEMI M56-1103 © SEMI 2003 2
2. 8    The  output  of  this  practice  is  the  cost  component
due   to   measurement   variability   and   bias   for   each
process characteristic and metrology system evaluated.
2. 9    This  practice  does  not  consider  costs  associated
with   other   components   of   uncertainty   outside   of
measurement variability and bias.
2. 10  Although it is focused on the issue of misclassifi-
cation,  the  practice  may  be  extended  to  include  costs
associated  with  correct  classification  by  the  metrology
equipment.
2. 11        This    practice    was    developed    to    evaluate
metrology     equipment     used     in     silicon     wafer
manufacturing, but it may be extended to other types of
metrology equipment by making suitable modifications.
NOTICE: This  practice  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability  of  regulatory  or  other  limitations  prior  to
use.
3  Limitations
3. 1      Application   of   this   practice   requires   that   all
measurement      variances      and      biases,      process
characteristic  distributions,  and  costs  of  classification
and  misclassification  be  accurately  characterized.    If
this  is  not  done,  the  resulting  calculation  may  be  in
error.
3. 2      Application   of   this   practice   also   requires   that
measurement variances and biases be constant over the
measurement range interval of interest.  If this is not the
case, the resulting calculation may be in error.
3. 3      This   practice   considers   only   the   case   of   two
convolved      distributions,      process      characteristic
variability  and  measurement  variability;  consideration
of additional distributions (such as would be required if
the measurement bias or variance were assumed to be a
function of the measured value) is beyond the scope of
this practice.
3. 4    Extension  of  the  model  to  the  cases  of  decisions
based  on  (1)  measurements  on  multiple  gauges,  (2)
multiple  inspections  with  the  same  gauge  or  (3)  on
multiple  characteristics  is  outside  the  scope  of  this
practice, but information on such extensions is provided
in  Related  Information  1  for  the  convenience  of  the
user.
3. 5    This  model  should  not  be  confused  with  a  cost-of-
ownership model, such as that developed in SEMI E35,
which   explicitly   includes   information   on   the   cost
elements involved.

6  Summary of Practice
6. 1    The  process  distribution  for  the  characteristic  of
interest is estimated or determined.
6. 2        The    bias    and    standard    deviation    for    the
characteristic  of  interest  are  determined  for  each  mea-
surement instrument to be evaluated or compared.
6. 3  The  quantities
α  and  β  are  calculated  from  the
appropriate  formula  depending  on  the  nature  of  the
specification (LSL only, USL only, or both).
6. 4    Costs,  based  on  the  applicable  business  model,  are
assigned to each of the four possible measurement out-
comes.
6. 5    The  cost  components  arising  from  measurement
variability    are    calculated    for    each    measurement
instrument being evaluated or compared.
6. 6      The   costs   due   to   measurement   variability   are
compared    to    establish    the    most    cost    effective
measurement solution for the application.
7  Procedure
7. 1    Estimate  the  PDF  for  the  process  characteristic  to
be studied.  This can be done using empirical data that
represents  the  process.    Although  actual  data  may  be
used   to   create   a   discrete   PDF,   it   is   sometimes
convenient  to  use  the  data  to  parametrically  fit  a  PDF
model (e.g., log normal).
7. 2      Unless   already   known,   establish   the   bias   and
standard  deviation  for  each  measurement  gauge  to  be
compared in accordance with SEMI E89.
7. 3    In  all  cases  take  the  measurement  influence  into
account so that it does not broaden the PDF.  This may
be done by taking repeated measurements at each point
in  the  measurement  range  and  calculating  the  mean,  or
by  deconvolving  the  process  characteristic  PDF, f(x),
and  the  measurement  variability  CDF,  G(u),  generally
assumed to be a Gaussian (or normal) distribution with
arithmetic mean equal to the bias, so that:

the  symbols  in  the  equations  for
α  and  β  have  the
following meanings:

NOTE 5:  Background  information related  to  the  calculation
of
α and β is given in Related Information 3.
7. 5    Use  a  binary  decision  model.    If  measurement-
based decisions are labeled as pass or fail and items are
inherently conforming or nonconforming, there are only
four outcomes:
• pass a conforming item,
• fail a conforming item (
α error),
• pass a nonconforming item (
β error), and
• fail a nonconforming item.
The  probabilities  associated  with  these  outcomes  are
1−
α, α, β, and 1−β, respectively.
7. 6    To  define  the  cost  model,  assign  costs  to  each  of
the  four  decisions  above  on  the  basis  of  the  business
model used for the manufacturing process as follows:
• c
pc
:  cost of passing a conforming item,
• c
fc
: cost of failing a conforming item (α error),
• c
pn
:   cost   of   passing   a   non-conforming   item   (β
error), and
• c
fn
: cost of failing a non-conforming item.
7. 6.1    Assign  zero  incremental  cost  to  the  two  correct
outcomes (c
pc
and c
fn
).
7. 6.2    Assign  the  incremental  costs  for  the  error  out-
comes, c
fc
and  c
pn
,  on  the  basis  of  the  business  model
used for the manufacturing process.
7. 7  Calculate the cost due to misclassification resulting
from  measurement  variability  based  on  the  assigned
incremental   costs   given   in   Section   7.6   and   the

NOTICE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  M56.    It  was  derived  from  task  force  deliberations
during the development of the document.  This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot

R1-1  Introduction
R1-1.1  In  general,  when a  single  characteristic  on  an
item  is  measured  once  on  a  single  gauge  and  100%
sampling  is  employed,  the  model  will  take  the  form
described in this practice.
R1-1.2    If  the  situation  is  more  complex,  the  nature  of
the  model  will  be  different.    Factors  that  can  affect  the
nature of the model include the following:
• number    of    items    examined    (lot    acceptance
sampling vs. 100% sampling),
• number  of  times  an  item  is  inspected  (single  vs.
multiple),
• effect   of   the   inspection   process   on   the   item
(destructive vs. non-destructive),
• number   of   item   characteristics   examined   for   a
single decision (one vs. many), and
• cost    functions    associated    with    the    business
decisions (fixed vs. variable).
R1-1.3  In addition, it is possible to have more than one
set  of  cost  functions  for  each  type  of  item  that  is
inspected  by  the  metrology  system.    Because  much  of
this is context specific, it would be impossible to cover
all  possible  models.    Other  extensions  to  the  model
include   relaxation   of   the   assumption   of   constant
variance, the introduction of variability in the bias, and
the  use  of  guard  banding.    The  foundation  of  all  these
extensions, however, is the use of
α and β.
R1-2  Extension to Multiple Gauges
R1-2.1    To  extend  the  model  to  multiple  gauges,  one
must make the additional assumption that all measuring
gauges are measuring the same characteristic.
R1-2.1.1    In  addition,  define  a  conforming  item  as  one
that  all  gauges  show  the  measured  characteristic  to  be
in specification.
R1-2.1.2    A  non-conforming  item  is  taken  to  be  one  in
which   at   least   one   gauge   shows   the   measured
characteristic to be outside of specification.
R1-2.2    It  is  then  possible  to  define  a  set  of
α  and  β
error  rates  for  each  gauge.    Let
α
1
, α
2
,  Ö,  α
n
be  the  α
values and
β
1
, β
2
, Ö, β
n
be the β values associated with
the n different gauges.
R1-2.3  The  overall
α  value,  α
T
,  is  calculated  from  the
equation:

NOTE 1: This equation is based on the probability P that the
item  is  conforming  but  that  one  or  more  gauges  give  a
conforming result:
α
T
= P[Item is conforming, ≥1 gauges show nonconforming]
= P[Item is conforming]

R1-3  Extension to Multiple Inspections with
the Same Metrology System
R1-3.1    Multiple  inspection  with  the  same  metrology
system  is  a  special  case  of  inspection  with  multiple
gauges.    If  the  same  measurement  system  is  used  to
measure  the  item  characteristic  repeatedly,  one  merely
lets
α
i
= α and β
i
= β for all i, as the α and β error rates
will not change for the same gauge.
R1-4  Extension to Decisions Based on
Multiple Characteristics
R1-4.1    It  is  also  possible  to  develop  a  model  where  a
decision  is  based  on  more  than  one  characteristic.    As
with  the  case  of  multiple  gauges,  several  assumptions
must be made.


SEMI M56-1103 © SEMI 2003 6
R1-4.1.1  The    characteristics    being    measured    are
independent  or  an  independent  combination  of  their
values is used.
R1-4.1.2    All  tests  are  performed  before  a  decision  to
reject or pass is made.
R1-4.1.3  F(x) has been deconvolved from F∑G.
R1-4.1.4  A conforming item is defined as one in which
all   measured   characteristics   are   shown   to   be   in
specification.
R1-4.1.5    A  non-conforming  item  is  taken  to  be  one  in
which    at    least    one    characteristic    is    outside    of
specification.
R1-4.2    It  is  then  possible  to  define  a  set  of
α  and  β

BACKGROUND OF THE METHODOLOGY
NOTICE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  M56.    It  was  derived  from  task  force
deliberations  during  the  development  of  the  document.    This  related  information  was  approved  for  publication  by
full letter ballot procedures on September 3, 2003.
R3-1    The  model  in  this  practice  is  used  to  assign
probabilities  (risks)  to  specification-related  events.    In
general,  there  are  two  probabilities  that  are  of  interest.
The  first  is  the  probability  of  getting  a  measurement
outside  of  the  specification  range  for  a  conforming
item.    This  is  often  called  the  producerís  risk  because
conforming product would be needlessly rejected in this
situation.    The  second  probability  is  that  of  getting  a
measurement     within     specifications     for     a     non-
conforming  item.    Consumerís  risk  is  the  term  applied
to  this  probability,  since  there  is  a  chance  of  non-
conforming product being accepted.
R3-1.1    For  the  purposes  of  this  standard,  the  event  of
rejecting  an  item  whose  true  value  lies  inside  of  the
specification  limits  is  considered  a  Type  I  error  with
error rate (probability)
α.
R3-1.2    The  event  of  accepting  an  item  whose  true
value   lies   outside   of   the   specification   limits   is
considered  a  Type  II  error  with  error  rate  (probability)
β.
R3-1.3      One   of   the   difficulties   in   formulating   the
statistical   model   is   that   there   are   two   or   more
distributions  involved,  possibly  in  an  interdependent
fashion.    Given  a  true  underlying  (fixed)  value,  x,  a
single  measurement  of  that  value  produces  the  obser-
vation Y = x + U,  where  U  is  a  random  and  unobs-
ervable  value  attributable  to  measurement  variability.
If  one  takes  n  measurements  of  the  same  value  x,  i.e.,
Y
i
= x + U
i
,  where  i = 1,Ö, n, Y  and  U  are  treated  as
random     variables     from     the     observation     and
measurement    variability    distributions,    respectively.
The  situation  is  further  complicated  if  several  x  values
are measured.  In this situation, the x values come from
the  process  (or  characteristic)  distribution  X such  that
Y
ij
=  X
j
+  U
ij
,  where  i = 1,Ö, n  and  j = 1,Ö, m.   The
relationship   between   X    and    U    is    known    as    a
convolution.    Additional  distributions  may  be  involved
if   one   assumes   that   certain   characteristics   of   the
measurement  process  do  not  remain  constant  over  the
measurement range.  For example, one may assume that
bias is a function of the measured value.  To model this
a  third  distribution  would  be  needed,  but  the  scope  of
this   practice   is   limited   to   the   use   of   only   two
distributions       (characteristic       and       measurement
variability).
R3-2  The symbols in the equations derived for
α and β
have the following meanings:
X = random   value   attributable   to   the   process
characteristic,
U  =     random  and  unobservable  value  attributable
to measurement variability,
f(x)    =     process characteristic PDF,
G(u)   =     measurement variability CDF,
USL    =     upper specification limit,
LSL =     lower specification limit, and
Φ(u)   =     Gaussian   CDF.
R3-3  The process characteristic PDF and measurement
variability CDF are assumed to be independent of each
other.
R3-4  For a process characteristic with only a USL:
R3-4.1  Define
α as a joint probability:

R3-7  To use the above functions in practice, additional
assumptions must be made:
R3-7.1        Equipment    bias    is    treated    as    constant
throughout  the  measurement  range.    This  is  needed  to
avoid a third function in the integral.
R3-7.2  In general, the distribution of the measurement
variability is assumed Gaussian (or normal), with mean,
μ,  and  variance,  σ
2
.    For  measurement  gauges,  μ = δ,
the   bias,   and
σ
2
= σ
M
2
,   the   measurement   system
variance.
R3-7.3  The distribution of the parameter of interest has
been   characterized.      This   may   be   done   by   taking
multiple     measurements     at     each     point     in     the
measurement  range  and  averaging,  or  by  deconvolving
F(x) and G(u).
R3-8    Given  the  assumptions  above  about  the  mea-
surement system, the following relationships apply:

EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE
NOTICE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  M56.    It  was  derived  from  task  force
deliberations  during  the  development  of  the  document.    This  related  information  was  approved  for  publication  by
full letter ballot procedures on September 3, 2003.
R4-1  This example relates to the calculation of the cost
components    due    to    misclassification    caused    by
measurement variability in flatness measurement during
wafer   manufacturing.      The   following   premises   are
made:
R4-1.1    A  wafer  manufacturer  must  supply  a  customer
with a specific number of wafers that conform to a site
flatness  specification  of  0.13  μm
,  SFQR  as  defined  in
SEMI M1.
R4-1.2    Most  wafers  produced  do  conform  to  the
specification.    Due  to  variability  in  the  manufacturing
process,    some    wafers    do    not    conform    to    the
specification.
R4-1.3    The  flatness  measurement  step  is  near  the  end
of the wafer manufacturing process.  It follows surface
polishing    and    precedes    final    cleaning,    surface
inspection, and packaging.
R4-1.4  All of the wafers are measured for site flatness.
The  measurement  data  is  used  to  determine  if  wafers
are  passed  for  further  processing  and  shipment  or  if
they are failed and scrapped without further processing.
This example premises no rework for failed wafers.
R4-1.5    The  customer  is  always  able  to  detect  a  non-
conforming  wafer.    When  a  non-conforming  wafer  is
detected,   it   is   returned   to   the   manufacturer   and   a
replacement   wafer   must   be   supplied   to   satisfy   the
specified order quantity.
R4-2      The   following   steps   follow   the   procedures
outlined in Section 6.
R4-2.1
Estimation of Process Distribution ó A total of
17,698      observations      was      made      on      flatness
measurements.    An  empirical  estimate  of  the  flatness
CDF was calculated from these data and is shown in the
column of Table R4-1 labeled
F(x).
R4.2.2
Estimation  of  Bias  and  Variance  for  Each
Gauge Compared
ó Two gauges are available.  Gauge
A  has  zero  bias  and  a  measurement  variability  of
σ
A
=  0.00433,  which  results  in  a  P/T  ratio  of  10%,
calculated  in  accordance  with  SEMI  M27  for  a  single
sided distribution.  Gauge B also has zero bias, but has
a  measurement  variability  of
σ
B
=  0.00867  or  a  P/T
ratio  of  20%.    Let  the  distribution  of  the  measurement
variability  for  the  two  gauges  be  normally  distributed
with  a  mean  of  zero  and  standard  deviations  given
above.
R4-2.3
Calculation of α and β ó To calculate α and β,
one needs to estimate
f(x) and Φ(z), where
z = (USL − x)/σ
M
.
The  values  in  the  column  labeled
f(x)  are  derived  by
dividing  the  value  in  the  count  column  by  the  total
number  of  observations.    σ(
z)  is  calculated  from  the
normal CDF using the numbers in the first column as
x,
0. 13    as    the    USL,    and    either
σ
A
= 0.00433    or
σ
B
= 0.00867 for σ
M
, depending on whether Gauge A or
Gauge B is used.  To calculate
α, for each row multiply
f(x)  by  1  − Ф(z)  and  sum  over  all  rows  at  or  below  the
specification   limit.      To   calculate
β,   for   each   row
multiply
f(x)  by  Ф(z)  and  sum  over  all  rows  above  the
USL.    The  calculations  for
α  and  β  for  the  two  P/T
ratios of 10% and 20% can also be found in Table R4-1.
R4-2.4
Decision  Model  ó  One  of  four  situations  may
occur  depending  on  the  true  flatness  of  the  wafer,
conforming  or  nonconforming,  and  the  decision  made
based  on  the  output  from  the  metrology  equipment,
pass or fail.  Two correspond to correct actions: passing
a  conforming  item  and  failing  a  nonconforming  item.
Zero   incremental   cost   is   associated   with   correct
classification.      The   two   situations   associated   with
misclassification,  passing  a  nonconforming  item  and
failing  a  conforming  item,  have  actual  incremental
costs.
R4-2.5
Estimation   of   Costs   ó   For   purposes   of
illustration,  let  the  cost  of  failing  a  conforming  wafer
(
c
fc
)  be  $300  and  the  cost  of  passing  a  nonconforming
(
c
pn
) wafer be $220.  The cost of ownership due to mea-
surement variability and bias can then be calculated as:
cost   =

SEMI M57-0705
GUIDE FOR SPECIFYING SILICON ANNEALED WAFERS
This guide was technically approved by the global Silicon Wafer Committee.  This edition was approved for
publication  by  the  global  Audits  and  Reviews  Subcommittee  on  April  7,  2005.    It  was  available  at
www.semi.org  in  June  2005  and  on  CD-ROM  in  July  2005.    Originally  published  July  2004;  previously
published March 2005.
1  Purpose
1. 1  A number of device manufacturers utilize silicon annealed wafers to gain improved device characteristics. This
guide provides information for developing specifications for silicon annealed wafers used to fabricate semiconductor
devices and integrated circuits.
2  Scope
2. 1  This  guide  covers  dimensional,  electrical,  chemical,  and  structural  properties  of  silicon  annealed  wafers  for
180 nm, 130 nm, and 90 nm device technology generations.
2. 2  Based on the guidance herein, the user of the guide can generate specifications for silicon annealed wafers.
2. 3  One  of  the  reasons  for  using  annealed  wafers  is  to  allow  a  reduction  in  the  crystal  originated  particles  (COP)
near the top surface region of the wafer.  Currently, only the COP surface density can be estimated.
2. 4  The  width  of  the  denuded  zone  (DZ)  free  of  bulk  micro  defects  (BMD)  is  also  an  important  parameter.
However, there is no standardized method to evaluate this characteristic at the present time.
2. 5  The  complete  EDI  Code  List  for  items  in  the  Order  Form  appropriate  to  silicon  wafers,  including  annealed
wafers, can be found in SEMI M18.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.
