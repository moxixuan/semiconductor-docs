SEMI E1-0697 (Reapproved 1102)
E

SPECIFICATION FOR 3 inch, 100 mm, 125 mm, AND 150 mm PLASTIC
AND METAL WAFER CARRIERS
This specification was technically approved by the Global Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee and is
the direct responsibility of the North American Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee.  Current edition
approved  by  the  North  American  Physical  Interfaces  and  Carriers  Committee  on  July  21,  2002.    Initially
available  at  www.semi.org    October  2002;  to  be  published  November  2002.    Orignally  published  in  1979;
previously published June 1997.
E    The  designation  of  SEMI  E1  was  updated  during  the  0303  publishing  cycle  to  reflect  the  editorial
modification of SEMI E1.5 via PIP form.
1  Scope
1. 1          This     specification     covers     the     dimensional
requirements  for  plastic  and  metal  wafer  carriers  used
for the processing and handling of 3 inch, 100 mm, 125
mm,  and  150  mm  diameter  wafers.  The  specification
has   two   classifications:   General   Usage   and   Auto
Transport  Usage.  General  Usage  is  a  basic  guideline
that  covers  3  inch,  100  mm,  125  mm,  and  150  mm
wafer  sizes.  Auto  Transport  Usage  is  intended  to  meet
the   in-use   requirements   for   the   interface   of   wafer
carriers  with  automated  wafer  processing  equipment.
Auto Transport Usage covers the 125 mm and 150 mm
sizes.
1. 2      To   meet   these   specifications,   carriers   must   be
manufactured  within  the  dimensional  limits  and  be
dimensionally stable within the specification when used
in accordance with manufacturers’ recommendations.
1. 3    This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.
NOTE 1:  Recommended  usage  should  be  agreed  to  between
user and supplier, since wafer carriers are manufactured from
a  number  of  different  materials  by  several  manufacturing
methods.

MECHANICAL SPECIFICATION FOR CASSETTES USED TO
TRANSPORT AND STORE 300 mm WAFERS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Physical  Interfaces  &  Carriers  Committee  and  is
the  direct  responsibility  of  the  North  American  Physical  Interfaces  &  Carriers  Committee.  Current  edition
approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on March 22 and April 30, 2001.  Initially
available  at  www.semi.org  May  2001;  to  be  published  July  2001.    Originally  published  in  1994;  previously
published June 1999.
E
This document was editorially modified in January 2003 to reflect the withdrawal of SEMI E44.  Changes
were made to Sections 3.1, 4.2, 4.4, and 4.17.  This document was also editorially modified in May 2004 to
reflect the withdrawal of SEMI E19.5.  Changes were made to Section 7.1.
1  Purpose
1. 1      This   standard   specifies   the   cassettes   used   to
transport    and    store    300    mm    wafers    in    an    IC
manufacturing  facility.  This  includes  both  manual  and
auto-transport  use  as  well  as  high-speed  extraction  of
the wafers in processing equipment.
2  Scope
2. 1  This standard is intended to set an appropriate level
of    specification    that    places    minimal    limits    on
innovation       while       ensuring       modularity       and
interchangeability  at  all  mechanical  interfaces.  Most  of
the  requirements  given  in  this  specification  are  in  the
form  of  maximum  or  minimum  dimensions  wit  very
few  required  surfaces.    Only  the  mechanical  interfaces
for cassettes are specified; no materials requirements or
micro-contamination  limits  are  given.    However,  this
standard   has   been   written   so   that   both   metal   and
injection-molded  plastic  cassettes  can  be  manufactured
in conformance with it.
2. 2    The  cassette  has  the  following  components  and
sub-components,  and  other  features.    A  “†”  symbol
indicates     components     or     features     that     include
dimensions   required   for   boxes   with   non-removable
cassettes.
Key:
• Required feature
◊ Optional feature

• 1 top domain
• 2 optical wafer sensing paths
◊ 4 robotic handling flanges (optional)
◊ 1 top cassette identification tag area (optional)
• 2  or  4  side  domains  (2  in  front  and  2  in  rear,  if
needed)
• supports  (for  13  or  25  wafers)  with  correct  wafer
pitch (10 mm) †

4  Terminology
4. 1  bilateral   datum   plane   —   a   vertical   plane   that
bisects  the  wafers  and  that  is  perpendicular  to  both  the
horizontal and facial datum planes (as defined in SEMI
E57).
4. 2  box — a protective portable container for a cassette
and/or substrate(s).
4. 3  carrier capacity — the number of substrates that a
carrier holds.
4. 4  cassette  —  an  open  structure  that  holds  one  or
more substrates.
4. 5  cassette bottom domain — volume (below z6 above
the horizontal datum plane) that contains the bottom of
the cassette.
4. 6  cassette sensing pads — surfaces on the bottom of
the cassette for triggering optical or mechanical sensors.
4. 7  cassette  side  domains  —  volumes  (from  z6  above
the   horizontal   datum   plane   to   z15   above   the   top
nominal wafer seating plane) that contain the mizo teeth
or  slots  that  support  the  wafer  and  the  supporting
columns on the sides and rear of the cassette.
4. 8  cassette  top  domain  —  volume  (higher  than  z15
above  the  top  wafer)  that  contains  the  top  of  the
cassette.
4. 9  conveyor  rails  —  parallel  edges  on  the  bottom  of
the   cassette   for   supporting   the   cassette   on   roller
conveyors.
4. 10  facial datum plane — a vertical plane that bisects
the  wafers  and  that  is  parallel  to  the  front  side  of  the
carrier (where wafers are removed or inserted). On tool
load  ports,  it  is  also  parallel  to  the  load  face  plane
specified in SEMI E15 on the side of the tool where the
carrier  is  loaded  and  unloaded  (as  defined  in  SEMI
E57).
4. 11  fork-lift  slots  —  rectangular  holes  (open  to  the
front and rear) in the bottom of the cassette for picking
up the cassette with a fork.
4. 12   front-opening  unified  pod  (FOUP)  —  a  box  (that
complies  with  SEMI  E47.1)  with  a  non-removable
cassette  (so  that  its  interior  complies  with  SEMI  E1.9)
and  with  a  front-opening  interface  (that  mates  with  a
FIMS port that complies with SEMI E62) (as defined in
SEMI E47.1).
4. 13  horizontal datum plane — a horizontal plane from
which  projects  the  kinematic-coupling  pins  on  which
the  carrier  sits.  On  tool  load  ports,  it  is  at  the  load
height   specified   in   SEMI   E15   and   might   not   be
physically  realized  as  a  surface  (as  defined  in  SEMI
E57).
4. 14   nominal  wafer  center  line  —  the  line  that  is
defined  by  the  intersection  of  the  two  vertical  datum

that bisects the wafer pick-up volume.
4. 16   optical  wafer  sensing  paths  —  lines  of  sight  for
optically  sensing  the  positions  of  the  wafers.  Several
horizontal  optical  wafer  sensing  paths  are  present  in

processed simultaneously in a process chamber.
4. 19    robotic   handling   flanges   —   four   horizontal
projections on top of the cassette for lifting and rotating
the cassette.
4. 20  sensor hole — an indentation on the bottom of the
cassette for inserting optical sensors.
4. 21   side  grip  pits  —  two  rectangular  indentations  on
each  side  of  the  cassette  for  lifting  and  rotating  the
cassette.
4. 22  transport  group  —  a  set  of  substrates  that  are
transported together between tools.
4. 23  virtual tracking unit — an entity (which could be
a  number  of  substrates  or  an  individual  die  or  mask
group)  that  the  factory  floor  control  system  treats  as  a
single unit for tracking purposes.
4. 24  wafer  carrier  —  any  cassette,  box,  pod,  or  boat
that contains wafers (as defined in SEMI E15).
4. 25   wafer  extraction  volume  —  the  open  space  for

5  Ordering Information
5. 1  Intended   Use   —   This   standard   is   intended   to
specify  300  mm  cassettes  over  a  reasonable  lifetime  of
use, not just those in new condition. For this reason, the
purchaser   needs   to   specify   a   time   period   and   the
number  and  type  of  uses  to  which  the  cassettes  will  be
put.  It  is  under  these  conditions  that  the  cassettes  must
remain  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  listed  in
Section 6.
5. 2  Temperature Ranges  —  The  purchaser  of  300  mm
cassettes  needs  to  specify  two  sets  of  temperatures  to
which  the  cassettes  might  be  exposed.  An  operating
temperature    range    is    the    set    of    environmental
temperatures  in  which  the  cassettes  will  remain  in
compliance with the requirements listed in Section 6. A
temporary temperature range is the set of environmental
temperatures  to  which  the  cassettes  can  be  exposed
such  that  when  the  cassettes  return  to  the  operating
temperature  range,  the  cassettes  will  be  in  compliance
with  the  requirements  listed  in  Section  6.  Limits  on
exposure   times   to   elevated   temperatures   should   be
specified.  Also,  the  purchaser  needs  to  specify  a  range
of temperatures for the wafers that might be inserted in
the cassettes.
5. 3   Info  Pad  Configurations  —  The  purchaser  of  300
mm  carriers  needs  to  specify  the  desired  info  pad
configuration    (up    or    down).        See    Appendix    1
(Application Notes).
6  Requirements
6. 1  Kinematic  Couplings  —  The  physical  alignment
interface  on  the  bottom  of  the  cassette  consists  of
features  (not  specified  in  this  standard)  that  mate  with
six  pins  underneath  as  defined  in  SEMI  E57.  Most  of
the  dimensions  of  the  cassette  are  determined  with
respect to the three orthogonal datum planes defined in
that  standard:  the  horizontal  datum  plane,  the  facial
datum  plane,  and  the  bilateral  datum  plane.  All  of  the
dimensions  for  the  cassette  are  bilaterally  symmetric
about  the  bilateral  datum  plane.  The  three  features  that
mate  with  the  pins  must  provide  a  lead-in  capability
that  corrects  a  cassette  misalignment  no  greater  than
r19   in   any   horizontal   direction.   However,   it   is
recommended    that    robots    placing    cassettes    on
kinematic   couplings   use   as   little   of   this   lead-in
capability as possible to avoid wear.
6. 2   Wafer  Orientation  and  Numbering  —  The  wafers
must  be  horizontal  when  the  carrier  is  placed  on  the
coupling,  and  the  wafers  are  numbered  in  increasing
order from bottom to top (so the bottom wafer is wafer
number  1,  the  next  wafer  up  is  wafer  number  2,  etc.).
After   processing   at   a   tool,   each   wafer   should   be
returned to the same slot from which it was taken.
6. 3  Cassette Sides — Figure 1 shows a cross-section of
the  horizontal  boundaries  of  the  cassette  side  domains
(which  contain  the  parts  of  the  cassette  higher  than  z6
above  the  horizontal  datum  plane  and  lower  than  z15
above  the  top  wafer).  In  this  and  following  figures,  the
most   heavy   lines   are   used   for   surfaces   that   have
tolerances  (not  surfaces  that  have  only  maximum  or
minimum  dimensions).  Table  1  defines  the  dimensions
shown  in  this  and  following  figures.  The  maximum
protrusions of any part of the cassette from the nominal
wafer  center  line  and  from  the  bilateral  datum  plane  is
r5 and x9, respectively. There are two optional side grip
pits  on  each  side.  For  optically  sensing  whether  a
cassette is properly in place, from left to right under the
bottom  wafer  is  an  optical  cassette  sensing  hole.  The
radius  of  this  hole  is  given  with  both  upper  and  lower
tolerances,  but  the  upper  tolerance  is  only  to  define  a
minimum aperture that must be met at only one section
on  each  side.  Other  than  through  the  optical  cassette
sensing  holes,  the  cassette  bottom  and  side  domains
must block any line of sight passing through both of the
two rectangles at x10 on each side bounded by z4, z20,
y2, and y3.
6. 4  Cassette  Top  —  Figure  2  shows  a  top  view  of  the
horizontal boundaries of the cassette top domain which
contains  any  part  of  the  cassette  higher  than  z15  above
the  top  nominal  wafer  plane.  The  top  robotic  handling
flanges  (optional),  the  side  grip  pits  (optional),  and
optical cassette sensing hole on the side can be seen in
Figure  3,  which  is  an  oblique  view  of  the  maximum
cassette dimensions (see Figure 14 to see how cassettes
need  not  take  up  all  of  that  volume).    The  maximum
radial  protrusions  of  the  cassette  top  in  the  front  and
rear  are  r6  and  r12,  respectively.  Dimensions  x6, x12
(shown  in  Figure  4),  and  y15  define  a  vertical  path  for
optically  sensing  wafers  through  the  top  and  bottom
domains.

Cassette Bottom Domain




SEMI E1.9-0701
E2
© SEMI 1994, 2004 6
6. 5  Cassette  Bottom  —  Figure  4  shows  a  bottom  view
of  the  horizontal  boundaries  of  the  cassette  bottom
domain  (which  contains  any  part  of  the  cassette  lower
than z6  above  the  horizontal  datum  plane).  At  the
nominal wafer center line, a circular hole with a radius
of r7  must  be  present  (up  to  a  height  of  z5)  in  the
cassette bottom to avoid interfering with pod latch pins.
For  moving  the  cassette  on  roller  conveyors  and  for
picking up the cassette with a fork lift, the cassette must
have  surfaces  on  the  left  and  right  open  to  the  bottom
and  outside  bounded  by  x15, x16, r10, z3  and  z4.  A
cylindrical  section  of  radius  r8  and  axis  at  x11  on  the
facial datum plane must be clear up to a height of z22 to
hold the cassette firmly on the lifting forks by the use of
a cylindrical pin.
6. 6  Carrier Sensing  Pads  and  Info  Pads  —  When  the
cassette  is  fully  down,  the  carrier  sensing  pads  (shown
in  Figure  5)  must  be  z2  above  the  horizontal  datum
plane. It is recommended that the areas surrounding all
of  the  carrier  sensing  pads  be  designed  in  conjunction
with the features that mate with kinematic coupling pins
so  that  a  mechanical  sensor  pin  cannot  interfere  with
the  lead-in  function  of  the  kinematic  couplings.  Other
sensing  pads  (called  info  pads  and  given  letter  names)
communicate   information   about   the   carrier.   Carrier
types  that  might  need  differentiation  include  the  open
cassette,  the  front-opening  unified  pod  (FOUP),  the
single-wafer  interface  (SWIF),  and  the  front-opening
shipping  box  (FOSB)  in  both  13-wafer  and  25-wafer
capacities  (and  possibly  other  capacities  if  reduced-
pitch  versions  are  later  standardized).  Note  that  since
this is a bottom view, the positions of sensors on a load
port will be switched, with the sensor for info pad A on
the right and the sensor for info pad B on the left as one
faces the tool from the front.
6. 7  Vertical Dimensions — Figures 6 through 13 show
the vertical dimensions of the cassette. Note that z8 (the
height of the bottom nominal wafer seating plane above
the   horizontal   datum   plane)   and   z12   (the   distance
between  adjacent  nominal  wafer  seating  planes)  are
given  as  absolute  distances  with  no  tolerance.  This
means  that  the  sum  of  actual  height  variations  in  the
cassette  from  the  kinematic  coupling  to  the  supporting
features  holding  each  wafer  must  be  contained  within
the  tolerance  of  z10  with  no  further  stack-up  at  each
higher wafer. The method for meeting this requirement
is left up to the cassette supplier.
6. 7.1    The  open  space  for  the  wafer  set-down  volume
consists  of  a  cylindrical  section  with  radius  r2  and  a
main  axis  parallel  to  and  y1  in  front  of  the  nominal
wafer  center  line.  The  top  of  this  cylindrical  section  is
z11  above  the  nominal  wafer  seating  plane  and  its
bottom  is  z10  above  the  nominal  wafer  seating  plane.
The  implications  for  wafer  positioning  of  the  tolerance
on r2 are as follows. The wafers should be placed in the
cassette  within  a  circle  of  radius  corresponding  to  the
smaller  bound  on  r2  to  avoid  touching  the  edge  of  the
wafer  to  the  side  of  the  cassette.  Once  the  wafer  has
been  placed,  the  cassette  must  not  allow  a  wafer  to
move outside of a circle of radius corresponding to the
larger  bound  on  r2.  There  are  two  exceptions  to  this
limit  on  wafer  movement.  When  the  wafer  is  pushed
toward the rear of the cassette, the location of the wafer
is  defined  by  the  wafer  pick-up  volume  (see  Section
6. 7.3).  When  the  cassette  is  gently  tilted  forward  up  to
45°,  the  wafers  may  slide  forward,  but  it  is  recom-
mended  that  they  not  extend  further  than  y20  from  the
facial   datum   plane.   This   may   be   accomplished   by
designing  the  teeth  supporting  the  wafers  to  include  a
“wafer stopper” at the front (as shown in Figure 11) that
is  outside  of  r2  and  under  z29.  Note  that  use  of  this
feature  will  reduce  the  height  of  the  wafer  extraction
volume.
6. 7.2    The  open  space  for  the  wafer  extraction  volume
includes a cylindrical section with radius r3 and a main
axis  parallel  to  and  y1  in  front  of  the  nominal  wafer
center  line.  The  top  of  this  cylindrical  section  is  z11
above the nominal wafer seating plane and its bottom is
z23  above  the  nominal  wafer  seating  plane.  The  wafer
extraction  volume  also  includes  the  extrusion  out  the
front  of  the  cassette  of  this  cylindrical  section  and  the
portion  of  the  wafer  set-down  volume  above  z29.  The
implications  for  wafer  extraction  of  the  definition  of
dimension r3 (r3 ≥ r2 + 1) are as follows. The cassette
must  give  an  extra  1  mm  (0.04  in.)  of  horizontal
clearance once the wafer is picked up from wherever it
ends  up  (within  the  bounds  of  r2)  after  transport  in  the
cassette.

6. 7.3  If a wafer is placed in the wafer set-down volume
and is then pushed toward the rear of the cassette, then
the entire bottom of the wafer must be contained in the
wafer  pick-up  volume.  However,  if  the  wafer  is  not
pushed toward the rear of the cassette (or the cassette is
not  tilted  back  during  transport),  then  the  wafer  may
only be somewhere within the wafer extraction volume.
The  wafer  pick-up  volume  is  defined  by  a  cylindrical
section  with  radius  r1  and  a  main  axis  at  the  nominal
wafer center line.  Its top and bottom are the upper and

lower   tolerance   of   z10   around   the   nominal   wafer
seating plane.
6. 7.4      To   prevent   wafers   from   creeping   out   of   the
cassette  during  transport,  the  fork-lift  area  may  be
slanted so that the front of the cassette is higher than the
rear.  Specifically,  the  surface  defined  by  z4  may  be
rotated by an angle ω about the line where z4 intersects
y29  (as  shown  in  Figure  13).  Only  the  surface  behind
y29  may  be  rotated.  Thus,  the  height  of  z4  shown  in
Figure  12  might  only  be  defined  at  y29,  and  z4  can  be
greater than 15 ± 1 behind y29. However, the flatness of
the  resulting  tilted  surface  must  still  fall  within  the
tolerance given for z4.
6. 8   Cassette  Identification  Tag  Area  —  The  following
areas are provided for putting identification tags on the
cassette.  Examples  of  such  tags  include  thin  electronic
modules  and  printed  labels  designed  to  be  read  by
either  humans  or  machines.  It  is  recommended  that
such  tags  be  contained  within  the  18  mm  by  60  mm
(0.71  in.  by  2.36  in.)  region  defined  when  the  bounds
are  tight.  It  is  also  recommended  that  if  such  tags  are
smaller than the minimum bounds of the tag area, they
should be centered within those bounds.
6. 8.1  An optional place for an identification tag on the
top of the cassette is shown in Figure 14. Although the
height  of  this  surface  is  not  specified,  the  surface  must
be  completely  visible  from  above.  The  parallelism  of
the  top  identification  tag  with  respect  to  the  horizontal
datum plane is given by z25. It is recommended that the
identification  tag  should  be  centered  on  the  bilateral
datum  plane  at  a  point  y21  behind  the  facial  datum
plane.
6. 8.2  An optional place for an identification tag on the
right-hand  side  of  the  cassette  is  shown  in  Figure  15
(where  “right-hand”  is  defined  as  the  right  side  of  the
cassette  when  it  is  oriented  correctly  and  it  is  viewed
from  the  rear).  Although  the  left-right  location  of  this
surface is not specified, the surface must be completely
visible from the right of the cassette.  The parallelism of
the  side  identification  tag  with  respect  to  the  bilateral
datum plane is given by x27. It is recommended that the
identification tag should be centered on the facial datum
plane at a point z99 above the horizontal datum plane.
6. 8.3  An optional place for an identification tag on the
bottom of the cassette is shown in Figure 16. Although
the  height  of  this  surface  is  not  specified,  the  surface
must be completely visible from below. The parallelism
of  the  bottom  identification  tag  with  respect  to  the
horizontal   datum   plane   is   given   by   z25.   It   is
recommended   that   the   identification   tag   should   be
centered  on  the  bilateral  datum  plane  at  a  point  y22
behind the facial datum plane.

6. 9   Pitch  and  Capacity — Table 2 shows the different
options with regard to the wafer pitch (spacing) and the
cassette  capacity.    Again,  no  tolerance  is  given  on  the
wafer pitch (z12), for reasons given in Section 6.7.
6. 10   Inner  and  Outer  Radii  —  All  concave  features
may have a radius no greater than r15 to allow cleaning
and   to   prevent   contaminant   build-up.   All   required
convex  features  must  also  have  a  radius  of  r16  to
prevent  small  contact  patches  with  large  stresses  that
might cause wear and particles. Here a required feature
is  an  area  on  the  surface  of  the  carrier  specified  by  a
dimension  (or  intersections  of  dimensions)  that  has  a
tolerance and not just a maximum or minimum (such as
the rim of the fork-lift pin hole, the edges of the robotic
handling  flanges,  and  the  corners  at  the  rear  of  the
cassette top and bottom domains).
6. 11   Vertical  Wafer  Access  —  This  standard  does  not
cover accessing wafers in a vertical orientation.

APPENDIX 1
APPLICATION NOTES
NOTE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of
SEMI  E1.9  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot  procedures
on   December   18,   1998.   The   recommendations   in   this
appendix are optional and are not required to conform to this
standard.
A1-1    The  cassette  capacity  is  intended  to  include  one
test  wafer.  It  is  recommended  that  process  equipment
be  designed  for  12  or  24  product  wafers,  but  tool
robotics should reach all slots.
NOTE:  The  carrier  capacity  need  not  be  the  same  as  the
transport  group  size,  the  process  batch  size,  or  the  virtual
tracking unit size.
A1-2    The  shape  of  the  features  holding  the  wafers  is
not  specified  in  this  standard.    However,  a  mizo  tooth
shape  (an  exaggerated  version  of  which  is  shown  in
Figure A1-1) is recommended.  It is also recommended
that  the  surface  that  touches  the  wafer  have  a  large
radius   to   minimize   stress   on   the   wafer   and   the
supporting   feature.      It   is   recommended   that   the
supporting  feature  touch  the  wafer  only  on  the  back
side  and  far  enough  away  from  the  edge  to  avoid
contact  with  the  wafer  notch  (if  any)  in  any  radial
orientation.

tooth

Figure A1-1
Mizo Tooth

A1-3    In  general,  it  is  recommended  that  the  wafer
notch  and/or  its  fiducial  identification  marks  be  kept
toward  the  front  of  the  cassette  and  the  front  of  the
cassette  top  extend  no  farther  than  y14  from  the  facial
datum plane, so that the identification marks on the top
wafer can be read without removing the wafer.
A1-4    Extra  clearance  (larger  than  the  pitch)  has  been
added   below   the   bottom   wafer   (for   non-random
sequential  access  to  the  wafers  with  a  faster  or  less
precise  robot)  and  above  the  top  wafer  (for  accessing
the wafers in a vertical orientation), see Section 6.11.
A1-5    If  wear  at  the  kinematic  couplings  is  a  concern
with  plastic  cassettes,  ceramic  or  metal  inserts  can  be
used for the mating features.
A1-6  Skewness, warp, rock, and stiffness are implicitly
defined in the geometric tolerances.
A1-7    To  increase  the  stability  of  the  cassette  on  the
kinematic  couplings,  the  points  on  the  cassette  bottom
that are the most distant from the lines connecting each
pair of coupling pins can be made as close as practical
to the horizontal datum plane so that the cassette cannot
tip very far off of the kinematic coupling pins.
A1-8    Figure  A1-2  shows  several  paths  for  optically
sensing  the  presence  and  planarity  of  wafers  in  the
cassette.  Also  shown  are  the  two  vertical  paths  for
sensing how far the wafers protrude.

A1-9  Figure A1-3 shows a small-footprint cassette that
conforms  to  the  requirements  of  this  specification.  In
order to prevent such a small cassette from being set on
the  kinematic  couplings  in  the  wrong  orientation,  a
frame  such  as  shown  in  Figure  A1-4  can  be  placed
around  the  couplings.  In  order  to  not  interfere  with  the
kinematic  couplings  alignment  function,  the  frame  can
extend   no   further   than   r19   from   the   maximum
boundaries of a cassette.
NOTE:  If  the  bottom  of  the  cassette  does  not  extend  below
the  bottom  conveyor  rail,  the  conveyor  rail  may  become
contaminated and may distribute particles.

Frame to Prevent Misalignment

A1-10  Conveyor rail edges need to be well defined for
smooth  guidance  and  to  avoid  vibration.  Thus,  the
minimum   radius   on   the   edge   that   does   not   create
particles   is   recommended.   For   similar   reasons,   the
tolerance    on    conveyor    rail    parallelism    and    on
dimension x16  should  be  kept  as  small  as  possible  for
the materials used.
A1-11    Table  A1-1  can  be  used  for  communicating
which  optional  features  are  present  on  cassettes  that
comply with this specification.
A1-12    In  general,  info  pad  A  (on  the  lower  left  in
Figure 5) was intended to indicates
the carrier capacity
(the  number  of  wafers).    For  example,  info  pad  A  was
previously  defined  to  be  in  the  down  position  (at  z2
above  horizontal  datum  plane)  if  the  carrier  holds  13
wafers  and  was  previously  defined  to  be  in  the  up
position  (at  z26  above  horizontal  datum  plane)  if  the
carrier  holds  25  wafers.    Info  pad  A  is  intended  to  be
read with a mechanical switch or optical sensor.
A1-13    In  general,  info  pad  B  (on  the  lower  right  in
Figure  5)  was  intended  to  indicates
the  carrier  type
(cassette  or  box,  etc.).    For  example,  info  pad  B  was
previously  defined  to  be  in  the  down  position  (at  z2
above horizontal datum plane) if the carrier is a cassette
and  was  previously  defined  to  be  in  the  up  position  (at
z26  above  horizontal  datum  plane)  if  the  carrier  is  a
box.      Info   pad   B   is   intended   to   be   read   with   a
mechanical switch or optical sensor.
A1-14    Info  pads  C  and  D  (slightly  forward  and  to  the
outside  of  info  pads  A  and  B)  are  intended  to  show
whether the carrier is dedicated to the front-end-of-line
(FEOL)  part  of  the  fabrication  process  (before  any
metal layers have been deposited on the wafer) or to the
back-end-of-line (BEOL) part of the fabrication process
(during  which  metal  contamination  may  be  present).  If
such carrier differentiation is required by the user, info
pads  C  and  D  are  recommended  to  be  down  and  up
(respectively)  for  a  front-end-of-line  carrier  and  the
opposite for a back-end-of-line carrier. Info pads C and
D  are  intended  to  interact  with  a  mechanical  pin.    See
application note R1-2 in SEMI 15.1 for a discussion of
how  to  use  pins  to  differentiate  FEOL  and  BEOL
carriers.

SPECIFICATIONS FOR QUARTZ AND HIGH TEMPERATURE WAFER
CARRIERS
These  specifications  were  technically  reapproved  by  the  Physical  Interfaces  &  Carriers  Committee  and  are
the  direct  responsibility  of  the  North  American  Physical  Interfaces  &  Carriers  Committee.  Current  edition
approved  by  the  North  American  Regional  Standards  Committee  in  October  1998.  Initially  available  at
www.semi.org  February  1999;  to  be  published  February  1999.  Originally  published  in  1986;  previous
published revision in 1996.
NOTICE:  This  document  was  balloted  and  approved
for withdrawal in 2003.
1  Scope
1. 1          These     specifications     cover     the     dimensional
requirements  for  quartz  and  high  temperature  wafer
carriers   used   in   processing   wafers.   These   general
requirements   assist   in   the   compatibility   of   wafer
carriers    and    most    automated    wafer    processing
equipment.   Wafer   pre-orientation   is   recommended
before  transferring  wafers  into  quartz  carriers  to  avoid
interference  between  the  flat  fiducial(s)  and  carrier
slots.  These  standards  are  intended  to  promote  the
interchangeability  of  wafer  carriers  and  encourage  the
production    of    equipment    suitable    to    a    greater
percentage of the market.
1. 2    The  design  definitions  of  SEMI  Wafer  Carrier
Specifications  assume  compliance  to  wafer  dimensions
defined in SEMI M1, M3, or M9. For a wafer carrier to
be  said  to  “meet  the  SEMI  specifications,”  it  must  be
manufactured within the dimensional limits of the given
specification,  and  in  addition  be  dimensionally  stable
within   specification   when   used   in   accordance   with
manufacturer's  recommendations.  Since  wafer  carriers
are   manufactured   from   a   number   of   different   raw
materials  and  several  different  manufacturing  methods,
it   is   up   to   each   manufacturer   to   determine   the
recommended  usage  for  each  wafer  carrier  type.  The
specifications    were    not    established    nor    do    they
represent   or   suggest   a   means   to   obtain   any   ideal
efficiencies in wafer processing results or quality of end
product.
1. 3      For   referee   purposes,   SI   (System   International,
commonly called metric) units shall be used for 80 mm
and larger diameter wafers.
2  Selected Definitions
2. 1  For  illustrations  of  terms,  see  Figure  1  for  Carrier
Style  1,  and  Figure  2  for  Carrier  Style  2.  Dimensions
and tolerances are given in Table 1 of the standards for
carriers of the appropriate wafer diameter.
2. 1.1  base  — the  material  at  the  bottom  of  the  carrier
that the carrier rests on when placed on a flat reference
surface.
2. 1.2  bottom plane — a horizontal plane tangent to the
base.
2. 1.3  end  — either  end  of  carrier  parallel  to  wafer
plane.
2. 1.4  lift access — the clearance space used to insert an
implement to pick up a wafer carrier.
2. 1.5  side  — either  one  of  the  sides  perpendicular  to
the wafer plane.
3  Dimension Definitions

APPLICATION NOTE
NOTE:  The  material  contained  in  these  application  notes  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E2  and  is  not  meant  to  modify  or
supersede  it  in  any  way.  Rather,  these  notes  are  provided  primarly  as  a  source  of  information  to  aid  in  the  application  of  the
standard, as such, they are to be considered as reference material only. The standard should be referred to in all cases.
Table   A1-1   lists   the   dimensions   in   linear,   versus
angular,    measurements    for    ease    of    dimensional
verification.    The    dimensions    fall    within    SEMI
specification;  however,  they  correspond  closer  to  an
“L”  angular  dimension  of  140  degrees  versus  the  150
degrees.  The  figures  A1-1  and  A1-2  illustrate  these
dimensions  for  non-contiguous  and  contiguous  style
quartz carriers.
A1-1 Carrier — Dimension L
Automated  mass  transfer  of  silicon  wafers  requires
edge   contact   below   the   centerline   of   the   wafer
according  to  Table  1.  These  dimensions  have  been
determined  as  the  minimum  distance  below  the  wafer
center line allowing the gripping mechanism to overlap
the   vertical   tangent   of   the   wafer   edge   below   the
centerline.   This   overlap   allows   the   wafers   to   be
passively  crattled.  Contacting  the  wafer  any  higher
toward the centerline will require clamping force on the
wafers.

NOTE 1: 25 capacity slot spacing is derived from SEMI E1.2.
NOTE  2:  50  capacity  slot  spacing  is  SEMI  E1.2  divided  by  2;  to  insure  compatibility  for  wafer  transfer  between  Plastic  &  High  Temperature
Carriers, the U.S. customary dimension is carried out to 5 decimals to eliminate accumulation in rounding error when multiplying times 49 spaces
to achieve I.
