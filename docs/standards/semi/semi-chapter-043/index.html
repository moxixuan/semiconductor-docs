2. 4  Adding  SDM  Mappings   SDM  mappings  added
to  part  two  of  this  document  are  considered  document
additions  and  are  balloted  as  such.    An  SDM  mapping
may  only  be  balloted  for  addition  to  this  document  if
the corresponding SEMI SDM has been standardized.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1          This     document     specifies     a     semiconductor
equipment  SAN  based  solely  on  EtherNet/IP  and  is  a
companion  document  to  the  EtherNet/IP  specification;
thus    a    complete    specification    of    this    standard
necessarily   includes   the   EtherNet/IP   specifications.
There    are    other    semiconductor    equipment    SAN
communications  options.  The  specifications  for  these
options are not included here.
3. 2  This  standard  specifies  enhancements  that  provide
additional  capabilities  over  and  above  those  currently
required  by  EtherNet/IP.    In  order  to  avoid  document
consistency  problems,  information  in  the  EtherNet/IP
specification that relates to this standard is not repeated
in   this   document.      This   document   is   limited   to
describing    enhancements    or    limitations    to    the
EtherNet/IP   specification   that   are   imposed   by   this
standard.
3. 3      A   complete   specification   of   the   conformance
testing    procedure    shall    include    the    EtherNet/IP
conformance    testing    specification.        Conformance
testing  shall  also  include  enhancements  and  limitations
to   the   EtherNet/IP   specification   required   by   this
standard.

5. 3.1      As   this   standard   defines   the   presentation   or
mapping  of  CDM  data  structure  and  behavior  over  a
network, it makes use of many of the terms in the CDM
document.  Table 1 provides a mapping of fundamental
terminology  of  the  CDM  document  into  this  document
and the EtherNet/IP specification.  Note that Column 2
contains  an  equal  sign  “=”  if  the  definition  is  used
exactly as specified in the CDM specification.

same   kind   of   system   component.      A   class   is   a
generalization  of  an  object.    All  objects  in  a  class  are
identical   in   form   and   behavior,   but   may   contain
different attribute values.</li><li>4.2  Control  and  Information  Protocol  (CIP)   The
common   network,   transport   and   application   layers
shared by EtherNet/IP and DeviceNet.</li><li>4.3  device profile  An EtherNet/IP specification for
a  device  that  contains  an  object  model  for  the  device
type,  the  I/O  data  format  for  the  device  type,  and  the
configuration  data  and  the  public  interface(s)  to  that
data.</li><li>4.4  encapsulation   The  technique  used  by  layered
protocols  in  which  a  layer  adds  header  information  to
the protocol data unit (PDU) from the layer above.  As
an  example,  in  Internet  terminology,  a  packet  would
contain a header from the data link layer, followed by a
header  from  the  network  layer  (IP),  followed  by  a
header  from  the  transport  layer (TCP), followed by the
application protocol data.</li><li>4.5  Ethernet   A  10/100-Mb/s  standard  for  LANs,
initially   developed   by   Xerox,   and   later   refined   by
Digital, Intel and Xerox (DIX).  All hosts are connected
to  the  network  media  where  they  contend  for  network
access  using  a  Carrier  Sense  Multiple  Access  with
Collision Detection (CSMA/CD).</li><li>4.6  EtherNet/IP   EtherNet/IP  (Ethernet/Industrial
Protocol)  is  a  networked  communications  protocol  that
specifies the encapsulation of CIP over TCP/IP.</li><li>4.7  Explicit  Message  Connections    Connections
over   an   EtherNet/IP   network   that   provide   generic,
multi-purpose    communication    paths    between    two
devices.  These connections often are referred to as just
Messaging Connections.  Explicit Messages provide the
typical  request/response–oriented  network  communica-
tions.</li><li>4.8  Input/Output  Connections    Connections  over
an EtherNet/IP network that provide dedicated, special-
purpose   communication   paths   between   a   producing
application  and  one  or  more  consuming  applications.
Application-specific I/O data moves though these ports.
6  Communication Protocol High Level
Structure</li><li>1        Though    the    protocol    specification    is    called
“EtherNet/IP”,   Ethernet   is   technically   not   required.
EtherNet/IP  may  be  used  on  any  media  that  supports
transmission   of   the   Internet   Protocol   (IP).      When
Ethernet  is  used,  it  shall  comply  with  the  IEEE  802.3
specification.
NOTE  1:    Conformance  testing  of  EtherNet/IP  products  is
limited to those products implemented on Ethernet.</li><li>2    The  following  sections  give  a  brief  description  of
the EtherNet/IP specification in terms of the seven layer
architecture   described   by   the   ISO   Basic   Reference
Model   for   Open   Systems   Interconnection   (the   OSI
model).</li><li>3  Physical Layer  The physical layer requirements
include  specifications  for  topology,  media,  connectors,
shielding and grounding.  Where copper media is used,
the    EtherNet/IP    specification    is    based    on    the
ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-B  Category  5/5E  cable/connector
specifications.    A  Commercial  grade  and  Industrial
grade   level   of   conformance   are   specified.      The
signaling  and  coupling  are  as  specified  in  the  IEEE</li><li>3 / TP-PMD standard.</li><li>4  Data   Link   Layer    For   compatibility   with
EtherNet/IP    conformance    testing    capabilities,    the
device must comply with the Ethernet Data Link Layer
Specifications  as  specified  by  IEEE  802.3.    Otherwise,
any data link layer that supports the IP is acceptable.</li><li>5  Network   Layer    The   network   layer   for   the
EtherNet/IP protocol is defined by the Internet Protocol
(IP version 4) (RFC 791).</li></ol><p>SEMI E54.13-0303 © SEMI 2003 4
6. 6  Transport Layer  The transport layer requires the
support  of  Transmission  Control  Protocol  (TCP)  (RFC
793)  as  well  as  User  Datagram  Protocol  (UDP)  (RFC
768).
6. 7  Session   Layer    Many   of   the   services   and
functions   of   the   session   layer   for   the   EtherNet/IP
protocol are divided and handled, in varying capacities,
by   the   TCP/UDP   protocol   specifications   and   the
EtherNet/IP Application Layer specifications.  The first
defines  transport  level  connection  sessions,  while  the
latter  defines  application  level  sessions  in  terms  of
Explicit Connection and I/O Connection management.
6. 8  Presentation  Layer   The  presentation  layer  is
defined  in  terms  of  standard  data  types  and  specific
encoding definitions for application layer data.
6. 9  Application Layer  The device shall comply with
the   EtherNet/IP   application   layer   specification   for
defining    and    addressing    objects,    including    their
attributes  and  services,  and  enabling  specified  network
behavior.    The  device  shall  comply  with  the  object
model   specifications   provided   in   the   EtherNet/IP
specification.
6. 10  Object models  EtherNet/IP provides an object-
oriented    specification    for    creating,    defining    and
addressing  objects  explicitly,  including  their  attributes
and  services  (i.e.,  explicit  messaging),  and  creating,
defining and communicating object attribute assemblies
in  an  application  dependent  format  (i.e.,  input/output
messaging).    The  device  shall  comply  with  the  object
model   specifications   provided   in   the   EtherNet/IP
documentation.    In  addition,  the  device  shall  comply
with  the  object  specifications  defined  in  Section  7  of
this document.
7  Required Object Types
7. 1        The    EtherNet/IP    specification    identifies    and
describes  objects  (i.e.,  classes)  that  must  exist  in  all
EtherNet/IP  compliant  devices.    The  Common  Device
Model  (CDM)  specification  additionally  identifies  two
objects,  the  Device  Management  (DM)  and  Sensor
Actuator Controller (SAC) objects, that must exist in all
SEMI  compliant  SAN  devices.    The  required  object
types  for  a  SEMI  compliant  SAN  device  utilizing  the
network  communication  specification  described  herein,
necessarily   comprises   the   union   of   the   above   two
requirements.
7. 2  A list of required and optional object types is given
in   Table   2.      Note   that   the   Sensor,   Actuator,   and
Controller   object   types   are   not   required,   and   are
indicated  as  optional  in  the  CDM  specification.    These
objects  are  aggregated  together  to  form  a  SEMI  and
EtherNet/IP compliant device.
7. 3    The  two  required  object  types  from  the  CDM  (the
DM   and   the   SAC)   are   implemented   as   mapped
components  in  EtherNet/IP;  they  are  mapped  to  the
SEMI-specific   S-Device   Supervisor   object   class   as
described in this section.
7. 4  The listed object types are:
• Identity,
• Message Router (MR),
• Connection (Conn),
• Connection Manager (CM),
• Ethernet Link (EL),
• TCP/IP Interface (TCP/IP),
• S-Device Supervisor (S-DS),
• Device Management (DM),
• Sensor Actuator Controller (SAC),
• Sensor,
• Actuator, and
• Controller.
7. 5    Also,  although  not  a  network  addressable  object,
each  device  shall  support  the  Unconnected  Message
Manager (UCMM) as defined by EtherNet/IP.

implementation detail of the following object classes:
• Identity
• Message Router (MR)
• Connection (Conn)
• Connection Manager (CM)
• Ethernet Link (EL)
• TCP/IP Interface (TCP/IP)
• S-Device Supervisor (S-DS)</li><li>7    The  Sensor,  Actuator  and  Controller  object  types
are  utilized  collectively  to  model  the  type  specific
structure  and  behavior  of  the  device.    The  requirement
and  number  of  each  of  these  object  types  in  a  device
model  is  device  type  specific.    Further,  the  attributes,
services  and  behavior  associated  with  each  of  these
object  classes  and  instances  in  a  device  is  also  device
type  specific,  but  must  be  compliant  with  both  SEMI
and  EtherNet/IP  specifications.    The  specification  of
these  object  types  for  a  specific  device  type  can  be
found   in   the   appropriate   SDM.      The   method   of
presentation  of  object  structure  and  behavior  to  the

associated  with  a  specific  device  type  can  be  found  in
Section 9 of this document.</li><li>8  The following sections describe the implementation
detail for the two required objects from the CDM.  The
EtherNet/IP   specification   essentially   combines   the
Device   Management   (DM)   Object   and   the   Sensor
Actuator Controller (SAC) Object into a single Object:
the S-Device Supervisor (S-DS) Object.</li><li>9  Device  Management  (DM)  Object    The  DM
object    is    the    device    component    responsible    for
managing  and  consolidating  the  device  operation.    The
DM object as well as its common required and optional
attributes,  services  and  behavior  are  described  in  the
CDM  standard.    The  presentation  of  object  attributes
and  services  to  the  EtherNet/IP  network  shall  be  as
indicated  in  Table  3  and  Table  4  respectively.    Each

SPECIFICATION FOR SENSOR/ACTUATOR NETWORK
COMMUNICATIONS FOR PROFINET
This specification was technically approved by the Global Information &amp; Control Committee and is the direct
responsibility  of  the  European  Equipment  Automation  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the
European  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  November  10,  2004.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>
February 2005; to be published March 2005.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  This specification is part of the SEMI Sensor/Actuator Network (SAN) suite of standards and defines a specific
communications protocol based on the PROFINET standard.  This Network Communication Standard (NCS) taken
together  with  the  SEMI  Sensor/Actuator  Network  standard  suite  and  the  PROFINET  standard  completely  and
unambiguously  defines  an  open  standard  providing  an  industry  specific  solution  to  off-the-shelf  interoperability  of
networked devices in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.</li><li>2  PROFINET is a vendor independent, open field bus standard for a wide range of applications in manufacturing,
process and building automation.</li><li>3  The  application  model  of  PROFINET  is  compatible  with  the  model  of  PROFIBUS.    The  same  mapping  rules
apply.</li><li>4  PROFINET is optimized for high speed and inexpensive connectivity between automation control systems and
distributed I/O at the device level.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This  document  specifies  a  SAN  communications  standard  based  on  the  PROFINET  specification  that  is  in
compliance  with  SEMI  E54.1.    As  such,  it  specifies  the  protocol,  services,  and  behavior  that  compliant  intelligent
devices must support in order to interchange information over this SAN in a method compatible with SEMI E39.</li><li>2  In conjunction with a SEMI standard SAN Common Device Model (CDM) specification and one or more SEMI
standard   Specific   Device   Model   (SDM)   specifications   (e.g.,   for   a   mass   flow   controller),   this   Network
Communication Standard (NCS) with the related PROFINET standard describe the data structures, interactions, and
behavior  that  are  characteristic  of  the  various  devices  on  the  network.    This  composite  model  forms  a  complete
interoperability standard for communications among intelligent sensors, actuators, and controllers in semiconductor
manufacturing equipment.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  This  document  specifies  a  semiconductor  equipment  SAN  based  solely  on  PROFINET  and  is  a  companion
document  to  the  PROFINET  specification,  including,  by  reference,  the  PROFINET  standard;  thus,  a  complete
specification  of  this  standard  necessarily  includes  the  PROFINET  specifications.    There  are  other  semiconductor
equipment SAN communications options.  The specifications for these options are not included here.</li><li>2  The  specifications  within  are  strictly  enhancements  that  provide  additional  capabilities  over  and  above  those
currently required by PROFINET.  Included throughout this document, primarily in §6, is information paraphrased
from  the  PROFINET  specifications  such  as:  protocol  structure,  capabilities,  options,  and  limitations.    This
information is provided here for reference only and is not intended to provide specification definitions.  In all such
areas,  refer  to  the  PROFINET  specification  documents  for  information.    This  document  is  limited  to  describing
enhancements or limitations to the PROFINET specification that are imposed by this standard.</li><li>3  A  complete  specification  of  the  conformance  testing  procedure  shall  include  the  PROFINET  protocol
conformance  testing  specification.    Conformance  testing  shall  also  include  enhancements  and  limitations  to  the
PROFINET specification required by this standard.</li></ol><p>SEMI E54.14-0305 © SEMI 2005 2

6  Communication Protocol High Level Structure
6. 1  The PROFINET IO protocol constitutes a collapsed form of the OSI seven layer architecture.  PROFINET IO
uses  physical,  data  link,  network,  transport,  and  application  layers  of  the  Reference  Model.    For  real  time
communication  a  three  layer  approach  with  physical,  data  link  and  application  is  specified.    This  section  has  been
formatted to be aligned with the Basic Reference Model for OSI.  Figure 1 gives an overview of the architecture.</p><p>OSI Reference Model  NCS Model

Layering of PROFINET in Relation to OSI</p><ol start="6"><li>2  General Behavior</li><li>2.1  In a typical remote I/O configuration, single IO controller architectures are used to optimize response times.
In lower speed applications, multi IO controller architectures are also possible.</li><li>2.2  Message transfer is organized in cycles.  A message cycle mainly consists of a set of Output Data Frames of
the IO controller and a set of Input Data Frames of several IO devices.  Every Output Data Frame is associated to an
Input Data Frame.  The monitoring of an IO application relationship is done by the receiver of that frames.</li><li>2.3  A brief description of the PROFINET protocol as it relates to the ISO 7498 OSI model follows in the sections
below.    For  protocol  efficiency,  PROFINET  does  not  define  layers  3  to  7  for  cyclic  IO  data  transfer  and  alarms.
Layer 7 is the interface between the Application Process and the communication stack.

6. 4  Data Link Layer — Layer 2
6. 4.1  Data Transfer
6. 4.1.1  The Data Link Layer provides the functions for sending and receiving data over the network.  Protocol Data
Units  (PDU)  are  packaged,  delivered,  and  checked.    Checks  are  used  to  guard  against  Line  Protocol  Errors  (e.g.,
frame, overrun, and coding violations).  IEEE 802.3 Data Link MAC sublayer is the preferred Data link technology
of PROFINET.  If an accepted data link standard other than IEEE 802.3 is being used it has to be clearly specified in
the product documentation.
6. 4.1.2  A  PDU  is  restricted  to  1500  bytes.    A  protocol  overhead  of  28  Bytes  is  needed  for  addressing,  error
detection and protocol selection.
6. 4.2  Conveyance of Data
6. 4.2.1  In IEEE 802 networks bridges (switches) are used to transport data.  These bridge functions are defined in
IEEE  802.1D  and  IEEE  802.1Q  (priority  options).    Real  time  extensions  can  be  used  to  enhance  performance  and
availability of bridged networks.
6. 5  Network Layer — Layer 3
6. 5.1  While  real  time  data  transfer  uses  a  protocol  with  no  network  layer,  all  other  services  are  using  IP  (Internet
Protocol) as network layer.
6. 6  Transport Layer — Layer 4
6. 6.1  All non-real time services are using UDP (User Datagram Protocol) as transport layer.
6. 7  Session Layer — Layer 5
6. 7.1   There is no distinct Session Layer in this CDM.
6. 8  Presentation Layer — Layer 6
6. 8.1  There is no distinct Presentation  Layer in this CDM.  The Encoding is part of the application layer.
6. 9  Application Layer — Layer 7
6. 9.1  The PROFINET IO application layer is structured in a so called service definition and protocol specification.
The  service  definition  uses  an  object  orientated  approach  and  specifies  the  services  for  remote  access  and  local
functions  together  with  their  objects  (the  ASE  is  a  class  definition  of  these  objects).    The  protocol  specification
includes both coding and state machines.
6. 9.2  Service Definition
6. 9.2.1  Application layer services are structured to reflect the needs of flexible configurable automation devices.  A
Device consists of a set of modules that are placed in slots (see Figure 2).  Modules are addressed uniquely by the
slot number.  The module view can be a hardware oriented  or reflects the software structure of the IO Device.
6. 9.2.2  Each module contains submodules that contain objects of different classes.  Submodules are the addresses of
the submodules.
6. 9.2.3  Slot  0  is  used  to  address  the  IO  Device  itself.    Subslot  0  represents  the  module  and  contains  no  IO  Data.
The other object classes can have instances scattered over the modules and their submodules addressed by slots and
their  subslots  respectively.    Each  submodule  (except  submodule  0)  can  contain  IO  Data,  Context  parameter,
Diagnosis  information,  Record  Data  and  Alarms.    Record  Data  is  a  generic  class  which  can  contain  different
application  specific  parameters  accessible  by  read  and  write  services.    There  is  a  set  of  identification  and
maintenance parameters defined in a PROFIBUS Guideline that are mandatory within PROFINET.</p><p>SEMI E54.14-0305 © SEMI 2005 7

6. 9.3  Protocol Specification
6. 9.3.1  An IO device has no IP-address and logical name when it is shipped.
6. 9.3.2  A set up procedure has to allocate name and IP-address prior to operation.
6. 9.3.3  To  access  an  IO  Device  a  controller  has  to  establish  the  context  first  with  a  connect  service.    A  check  is
done  to  ensure  that  the  appropriate  device  type  with  the  required  resources  is  accessed.    Resources  can  be  locked
with the connect service.
6. 9.3.4  After  a  positive  confirmation  of  the  connect  service  the  IO  device  may  be  loaded  with  the  parameter
required by the controller application (e.g.  warning limits, measure range, filter time).  A control service is issued at
the end of parameterization.
6. 9.3.5  There is a control service indicating that the IO Device application is ready to enter the operate state.  The
start up is completed with this service.
6. 9.3.6  After this start up procedure the data exchange of IO data can be done and alarms can be signaled from the
IO Device to the IO Controller.  The IO Controller can invoke services to read and write record data that contain all
kind of information e.g.  produced units, calibration information, and batch information.
6. 9.3.7  A Release service will terminate the context.
6. 9.3.8  A context is monitored by the receipt of Input Data at the IO controller and by the receipt of Output Data at
the  IO  device  site.    A  timeout  error  of  one  timer  unit  is  allowed  which  makes  it  possible  to  use  a  single  timer
resource with granularity in the range of a millisecond.
6. 9.3.9  Figure 3 shows a sequence diagram of the start up procedure.

6. 9.4  Communication Management
6. 9.4.1  DCP (Discovery and Configuration Protocol) is used for basic management of stations (especially setting of
IP-address and Device name).  DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) can be used as configuration option.
6. 9.4.2  Connectionless DCE RPC is used as an interface between transport and application.
6. 9.4.3  “Identification  &amp;  Maintenance  Functions”  (I&amp;M  functions)  define  general  parameters  and  protocols.    The
main purpose of the I&amp;M functions is to support the end user during various scenarios of a device’s life cycle be it
configuration,  commissioning,  parameterization,  diagnosis,  repair,  firmware  update,  asset  management,  audit
trailing, and alike.  Well-defined uniform parameters and rules should enable the manufacturers to offer devices that
behave  in  a  uniform  manner  These  profile  guidelines  take  into  account  requirements  from  FDA  (Food  &amp;  Drug
Administration) and others.  The basic information offered can be characterized as “Type Plate” or “Boiler Plate”.  It
consists  of  Manufacturer  ID,  Order  ID,  Serial  Number,  Hardware  Revision,  Software  Revision,  Revision  Counter,
Profile ID.
7  Required Object Types

9  Specific Device Model Mappings
9. 1  Every  type  of  device  shall  have  an  identifier  number.    Vendors  must  apply  for  an  identifier  number  from  the
PROFIBUS  User  Organization.    A  Device  Profile  shall  be  submitted  in  the  form  of  a  GSD  File  and  Device  Data
Base Sheet.
9. 2  The  Device  Profile  must  specify  the  identifiers  for  Objects,  Attributes  and  Services  for  CDM  and  SDM
components, including data formats and bit mappings for specified parameters, as represented in this document.
9. 3  The following sections specify mappings for Sensor Actuator Network Specific Device Models.
9. 4  Mass Flow Device
9. 4.1  Reference SEMI E54.3 for a complete specification of the SDM for Mass Flow Devices (MFD).
9. 4.2  Objects
9. 4.2.1  Consistent with SEMI E54.3 and ¶7.4 above, the DM and SAC objects are identified as Object 1 and Object
2, respectively.
9. 4.2.2  Notice that references for the Local Link Objects are not included; the existence of these objects are implied
by behavior and not explicitly included.  Therefore, these objects are not accessible from the network.
9. 4.2.3  Table 18 shows the mapping of the SDM.
9. 4.2.4  Objects specified in SEMI E54.3 are listed under the heading NCS Module ID.  Every instance is allocated
to  a  slot  number.    The  configuration  can  be  modeled  in  the  GSD  by  using  the  Module  ID  as  key  for  the  module

SENSOR/ACTUATOR NETWORK COMMUNICATION SPECIFICATION
FOR SafetyBUS p
This specification was technically approved by the Global Information &amp; Control Committee and is the direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Information  &amp;  Control  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the
North American Regional Standards Committee on December 10, 2005.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>
February 2005; to be published March 2005.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  This   standard   defines   a   communication   specification   based   on   the   SafetyBUS   p   protocol   to   enable
communications  between  intelligent  devices  on  a  sensor/actuator  network  (SAN)  that  operate  according  to  SEMI
specified device models (common and device specific) in a semiconductor manufacturing equipment.</li><li>2  Background and Motivation</li><li>2.1  SafetyBUS p is a device level network which provides a simple, inexpensive, fast, and deterministic means of
exchanging data among industrial devices (e.g., sensors and actuators) and higher level devices such as controllers
(e.g.,  programmable  control  systems)  while  at  the  same  time  providing  for  the  communication  of  information  at  a
high priority level to support reliable operations.  SafetyBUS p provides:
• A solution to low-level device networking,
• Access to intelligence present in low-level devices,
• Networking between higher level controllers,
• Master/Slave and Peer-to-Peer communication capabilities, and
• Serial communication of device-critical information.</li><li>2.2  SafetyBUS p specifies a communication model and protocol.  The Physical and Data Link Layer definitions
are defined by the Controller Area Network (CAN) technology.  The CAN specification provides the Media Access
Control (MAC) methodology and physical signaling characteristics.</li><li>2.3  This document enables communications between intelligent devices on a SEMI compliant SAN by providing
a  presentation  mapping  of  common  and  specific  device  network  visible  structure  and  behavior  to  SafetyBUS  p
network.</li><li>2.4  This Network Communication Standard specification for SafetyBUS p is not intended to be a safety guideline
for  using  SafetyBUS  p  technology.    This  document  specifies  a  SAN  communications  standard  specification  based
on  the  Object  Communication  Specification  (OCS)  for  the  SafetyBUS  p  Protocol.    This  SAN  is  structured  in
compliance with SEMI E54.1.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This  document  specifies  the  protocol  and  services  that  compliant  intelligent  devices  shall  support  to  exchange
information over the SafetyBUS p semiconductor equipment sensor/actuator network.</li><li>2  This  document  specifies  the  utilization  of  the  SafetyBUS  p  protocol  to  present  externally  visible  device
structure  and  behavior,  specified  in  the  Common  Device  Model  (CDM)  and  appropriate  Specific  Device  Models
(SDMs), on a SafetyBUS p network.</li><li>3  This document is used in conjunction with a SEMI standard SAN Common Device Model specification, one or
more SEMI standard Specific Device Model (SDM) specifications (e.g.  for a mass flow device), the SafetyBUS p
Object  Communications  Specification  Reference  Guide.    Together,  they  describe  the  SafetyBUS  p  protocol,  the
externally  visible  data  structures  and  behaviors  of  devices  utilizing  the  SafetyBUS  p  networking  capability  in  a
SEMI compliant SAN system.</li></ol><p>SEMI E54.15-0305 © SEMI 2005 2
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.

document to the Object Communication Specification for the SafetyBUS p Protocol; thus a complete specification
of  this  standard  necessarily  includes  the  SafetyBUS  p  protocol  specifications.    There  are  other  semiconductor
equipment SAN communications options.  The specifications for these options are not included.
3. 2  This  standard  specifies  enhancements  that  provide  additional  capabilities  over  and  above  those  currently
required  by  SafetyBUS  p.    In  order  to  avoid  document  consistency  problems,  information  in  the  Object
Communication  Specification  for  the  SafetyBUS  p  Protocol  that  relate  to  this  standard  is  not  repeated  in  this
document.    This  document  is  limited  to  describing  enhancements  or  limitations  to  the  SafetyBUS  p  specifications
that are imposed by this standard specification.

sacrifice modularity in order to achieve high performance.</li><li>1.2  The application layer is specified in the SafetyBUS p OCS (see reference ¶4.3) and provides for the definition
of SafetyBUS p applications as a collection of addressable objects.  A subset of these objects may be addressed over
the network (as defined by the implementation).</li><li>1.3  In  the  remainder  of  this  section  the  protocol  structure  is  described  in  more  detail  in  terms  of  the  OSI  seven

7  Required And Optional Object Types
7. 1  The SafetyBUS p standard specification does not require any specific objects to exist in a SafetyBUS p device
in order to be a compliant SafetyBUS p device.  The SafetyBUS p standard specification is extended in this standard
to  identify  and  describe  objects  (i.e.    classes)  that  shall  exist  in  devices  that  are  to  be  interoperable  and
interchangeable on a SafetyBUS p SEMI compliant SAN network.
7. 1.1  The  Common  Device  Model  (CDM)  specification  (see  reference  SEMI  E54.1  ¶4.1)  identifies  two  objects
(namely  the  Device  Manager  (DM)  and  Sensor  Actuator  Controller  (SAC)  objects)  that  shall  exist  in  all  SEMI
compliant SAN devices.
7. 1.2  The   required   object   types   for   a   SEMI   compliant   SAN   device   utilizing   the   network   communication
specification  described  herein  necessarily  comprises,  at  minimum,  the  union  of  the  SafetyBUS  p  object  type
requirements and the CDM specification requirements.
7. 1.3  A  list  of  required  and  optional  object  types  is  given  in  Table  2.    Additional  objects  that  are  specified  in  a
particular  SDM  are  given  identifiers  in  that  SDM  specification;  SafetyBUS  p  specific  presentation  information  for
these identifiers is given in Section 9 of this document.

7. 1.5  In  the  following  sections  the  presentation  to  the  network  of  object  addressing,  object  attributes  and  object
services for each of the object types listed in Table 2 is described in detail.  Refer to the CDM standard to determine
if the object instance attribute and service is specified as required or optional.  Unless otherwise noted, all attributes
and services described are instance level attributes (as opposed to class level attributes).  A class level attribute and
service is accessed as instance number zero.
7. 1.6  Note that the formats of object attributes and services are detailed in the CDM document; the presentation of
object  attributes  and  services  to  the  SafetyBUS  p  network  is  detailed  in  the  tables  contained  in  the  following  sub-
sections and in the SafetyBUS p standard specifications.
7. 2  Device  Manager  (DM)  Object  ––  The  DM  object  instance  is  the  device  component  responsible  for  managing
and consolidating the device operation.  Each device must support one (and only one) DM object.  The DM object as
well as its common required and optional attributes, services and behavior are described in the CDM standard.  The
presentation of object instance attributes and services to the SafetyBUS p network shall be as indicated in Table 3.
Note  that  all  service  ID  values  identified  refer  to  the  ID  of  the  request  or  notification  component  of  that  service.
Corresponding  reply  components  to  request/reply  services  shall  have  a  service  ID  value  equal  to  the  request
component ID plus one.

8. 1  A  method  of  testing  protocol  compliance  is  required  to  verify  implementation  conformance  to  the  standard.
SafetyBUS  p  Club  International  e.V.    has  established  and  maintains  a  mechanism  for  compliance  certification  of
devices on a SafetyBus p network.  This certification includes procedures and reporting mechanisms to demonstrate
conformance testing and interoperability testing of SafetyBUS p devices.  The SafetyBUS p Club International e.V.
organization can be contacted at the web site <a href="http://www.safetybus.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.safetybus.com</a> to obtain the latest certification procedures.
9  Specific Device Model Mappings
9. 1  This section provides for the mapping of network visible specific device structure and behavior, specified in a
SEMI  standard  SDM  specification,  to  the  SafetyBUS  p  network.    Each  subsection  is  devoted  to  a  single  Specific
Device Model (SDM) specification.  Additional SDM mappings are added as sub-sections to this NCS specification
according  to  SEMI  guidelines  and  the  guidelines  of  the  SEMI  SAN  Interoperability  standard.    Unless  otherwise
noted, all attributes and services described are instance level attributes (as opposed to class level attributes).
9. 1.1  Note  that  the  formats  of  object  instance  attributes  and  services  are  detailed  in  the  associated  SDM
specification; the presentation of object attributes and services to the SafetyBUS p network is detailed in the tables
contained  in  the  following  sub-sections  and  in  the  SafetyBUS  p  standard  specifications.    Note  that  relationships
between  object  classes,  including  inheritance  are  defined  in  the  associated  SDM  specification  and  the  CDM
specification.</p><p>SEMI E54.15-0305 © SEMI 2005 15
9. 1.2  The  instance  identifier  of  1  through  s,  assigned  to  an  object  type,  refers  to  the  possibility  of  multiple
instantiations of the object type.  Refer to Table 2 of this document and the CDM document for a further explanation
of object instance identifier assignments.
9. 2  Specific Device Model for Mass Flow Device
9. 2.1  These  sections  detail  the  network  mapping  required  to  support  the  Specific  Device  Model  for  Mass  Flow
Device (see SEMI E54.3 ¶4.1).  Table 15 summarizes the Mass Flow Device Object types.  Subsequent Tables 16 to
25 details the instance attributes and services associated with each Mass Flow Device object type.
