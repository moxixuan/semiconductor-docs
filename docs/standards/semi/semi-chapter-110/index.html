6. 5  Wafers shall meet all requirements related to other characteristics, if any such requirements are specified in the
purchase order.
7  Sampling
7. 1  Unless  otherwise  specified,  appropriate  sample  sizes  shall  be  selected  from  each  lot  in  accordance  with
ANSI/ASQC Z1.4.  Each quality characteristic shall be assigned an acceptable quality level (AQL) or lot tolerance
percent  defective  (LTPD)  value  in  accordance  with  ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4  definitions  for  critical,  major,  and  minor
classifications.  If desired and so specified in the contract or order, each of these classifications may alternatively be
assigned  cumulative  AQL  or  LTPD  values.    Inspection  levels  shall  be  agreed  upon  between  the  supplier  and  the
customer.
8  Test Methods
8. 1  Because no test methods have been standardized and identified in Table 1, all tests to be made to assure that the
wafers meet the required characteristics shall be agreed upon between supplier and customer.
9  Certification
9. 1  Upon  request  of  the  customer  in  the  contract  or  order,  a  manufacturer’s  or  supplier’s  certification  that  the
material was manufactured and tested in accordance with this specification, together with a report of the test results,
shall be furnished at the time of shipment.
9. 2  In the interest of controlling inspection costs, the supplier and the customer may agree that the material shall be
certified  as  “capable  of  meeting”  certain  requirements.    In  this context, “capable of meeting”  shall  signify  that  the
supplier is not required to perform the appropriate tests.  However, if the customer performs the test and the material
fails to meet the requirement, the material may be subject to rejection.
10  Product Labeling
10. 1  The wafers supplied under these specifications shall be identified by appropriately labeling the outside of each
box or other container and each subdivision thereof in which it may reasonably be expected that the wafers will be
stored  prior  to  further  processing.    Identification  shall  include  as  a  minimum  the  nominal  diameter,  conductivity
type,  dopant,  orientation,  resistivity  range,  and  lot  number.    The  lot  number,  either  (1)  assigned  by  the  original
manufacturer of the wafers, or (2) assigned subsequent to wafer manufacture but providing reference to the original
lot  number,  shall  provide  easy  access  to  information  concerning  the  fabrication  history  of  the  particular  wafers  in
that  lot.    Such  information  shall  be  retained  on  file  at  the  manufacturer’s  facility  for  at  least  one  month  after  that
particular lot has been accepted by the customer.
11  Packing
11. 1  Special packing requirements shall be subject to agreement between the supplier and customer.  Otherwise, all
wafers shall be handled, inspected, and packed in such a manner as to avoid chipping, scratches, and contamination
and in accordance with the best industry practices to provide ample protection against damage during shipment.</p><p>NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for any

PROPOSED GUIDE FOR STANDARD PERFORMANCE, PRACTICES,
AND ASSEMBLY FOR ULTRA HIGH PURITY MICROSCALE FLUIDIC
SYSTEMS FOR USE IN SCALABLE PROCESS ENVIRONMENTS
This proposed guide was technically approved by the global MEMS Committee.  This edition was approved

5. 2.9  Wafer Level Sealing — bonding of wafers by anodic, silicon direct, eutectic, or adhesive means.
5. 2.10  Macrosealing — sealing on components at the macroscale.
5. 2.11  Static Seals — seals that operate with non-moving surfaces.
5. 2.12  Dynamic Seals — seals that operate with moving surfaces.
5. 2.13  high-purity —  of  a  system,  subsystem,  or  component  used  for  the  control  of  chemicals  (gases  or  liquids),
designed and constructed in such a manner that it does not introduce significant impurities, particulate or molecular,
into the flow stream it controls or regulates.
NOTE 1:  Such systems, subsystems, or components are designed and constructed such that, if an impurity is introduced into the
flow path, it can be readily purged to an insignificant level.
5. 3  leak — a path (or paths) in a sealed system that will pass tracer gas when a pressure differential, a concentration
differential, or diffusion path exists. There are two leak mechanisms: a mechanical passage and a material through
which gas can diffuse or permeate. A leak may have both mechanisms operating in parallel.
5. 4  leakage, inboard — leakage from outside to inside occurring when the internal pressure is less than the external
pressure  acting  on  a  component  or  the  concentrations  of  a  given  component  are  different  inside  and  outside
generating a non-zero chemical potential. Inboard leakage is typically determined by introducing a tracer gas around
the exterior of the piping system or component under test.
NOTE 2:  Inboard  leak  tests  are  easier  tests  to  conduct  to  high  sensitivity  levels,  but  are  typically  not  indicative  of  pressurized
operating  conditions.  It  is  difficult  to  correlate  an  inboard  leak  test  to  the  performance  of  a  component,  subsystem,  or  system
when under internal pressure. Also, the internal collapsing forces created by external pressure may mask leaks which may exist
under pressurized operating conditions.
5. 5  leakage,  internal  —  leakage  occurring  within  a  component  across  a  flow  barrier,  such  as  the  seat  of  a  closed
valve.
5. 6  leakage,  outboard  —  leakage  from  inside  to  outside  occurring  when  the  internal  pressure  is  greater  than  the
external pressure acting on a component. Outboard leakage is typically determined by introducing a tracer gas into

5. 7  Microfluidic  Subsystesm —  a  “microfluidic  subsystem”  in  a  fluidic  system  may  contain  one  or  many  MEMS
components.  The subsystem contains control and signaling elements.  The subsystem, in turn, is attached fluidically
to a larger system or subsequent process.  e.g.  mass flow controller for fluid delivery, lab-on-a-chip.
5. 7.1  Fluidic Adapter — a physical interconnecter that fluidically links a microfluidic component to another micro-
or macro-scale fluidic device.
6  Design Guidelines
6. 1  Purpose —  Define  basic  design  criteria  for  micro-fluidic  interconnections,  considering  factors  such  as  fluid
type,  pressure,  flow  rate,  surface  conditions,  materials  and  their  compatibilities,  etc.  Establish  a  recommended
standard scaling rule for dimensions of such interconnections.
6. 2  Scope — Micro-sealing connections as defined in ¶5.2.3 above, for applications in two pressure ranges: below
one atmosphere and 0–125 psig, and in three temperature ranges: &lt;0 C, 0–100 C, and &gt;100 C.
6. 3  Define Design Parameters
6. 3.1  Overall dimension and weight constraints:  MEMS component, subsystems, system, fittings, manifolds.
6. 3.2  For  different  materials  used  to  join  parts  check  that  the  differences  in  thermal    expansion  coefficients  are
acceptable for the temperature range that the component or system will be used in.
6. 3.3  For different materials used to join parts check material chemical characteristics are compatible (see materials
§7 below).
6. 3.4  Fluid  types  to  be  used  with  MEMS,  define  gases  and  liquids,  reference  SEMI  F79  (Gas  Compatibility  with
Silicon).  List all materials in wetted path.
6. 3.5  Electrical configuration, digital or analog IEEE standards?</p><p>SEMI PR9-0705 © SEMI 2005 3
6. 3.6  Volumes should be minimized (internal, connecting, interface/interconnection, dead volumes), give relation to
time and process response, give dry-down constraints.
6. 3.7  Surface roughness requirements.
6. 3.8  Design for shock and vibration criteria, Reference MIL-STD 810.
6. 3.9  Leak integrity: permeability, across the seat, and inboard.  Reference SEMI F1.
6. 3.10  Accuracy, repeatability, control range requirements.
6. 3.11  Purging capability, number of times of full scale should flow for purging, turnover requirement.
6. 3.12  Direction of flow
6. 3.13  Upstream  filtration  requirements,  particle  requirements,  moisture,  other  contamination  characteristics.

space is limited.</li><li>3.21  Surfaces  that  come  into  contact  with  samples,  process  gasses,  or  chemicals  must  not  adsorb  or  react  with
them.  Select components or tubing that is: 1) inherently compatible, 2) can be treated (water rinsed, O

7  Materials Guidelines</li><li>1  Purpose — Provide a Matrix of Materials Compatibility for commonly used materials and provide examples of
applying the matrix to designs.</li><li>2  Scope — Use of this guide is limited to materials types known to be commonly used such as: silicon, polymers,
glass, metals, ceramics and plastics.</li><li>2.1  This guideline applies to materials which may be used in fluidic devices in large or small form factors.  It is
assumed the material is in the wetted flow path as either a thin surface film or bulk material.  Standard temperature
(0ºC)  and  pressure  (1  atm)  are  conditions  considered  in  this  table  unless  otherwise  stated.    Physical,  mechanical,
thermal,  microstructural,  and  electrical  properties  of  materials  can  be  found  in  materials  selection  handbooks  or
material  supplier  datasheets.  Breadth  of  details  for  chemical  compatibility  and  materials  properties  varies  widely
within  these  literature  and  care  must  be  taken  to  consider  relevant  information.  unlikely  that  a  single  source  of
information would be suitable.</li><li>2.2  The  intended  use  of  the  compatibility  matrix  is  to  provide  a  general  resource  to  the  user.    Detailed  research
into  materials  compatibility  with  specific  chemicals  is  an  important  part  of  any  product  development  program.    In
depth  research  into  materials  and  fluid  analysis  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  guide  and  will  be  required  in  most
circumstances.</li></ol><p>1 Hsu, Tai-Ran; MEMS and Microsystems Design and Manufacture; McGraw-Hill, 2002 Section 6.7.</p><p>SEMI PR9-0705 © SEMI 2005 4
7. 2.3  The   reader   is   specifically   requested   to   consult   the   Materials   Safety   Data   Sheet   (MSDS)   and   the
manufacturer’s  recommended  practices  for  any  fluid  or  component  prior  to  use  and  to  follow  the  suggestions
prescribed. In addition, the acceptable degree of chemical and material incompatibilities are relative to conditions of
use.  For instance, microscopic corrosion may be intolerable in one application yet may be quite tolerable in another.

8. 7  An example with a diagram is desired.  See Figures 1–4.
9  Subsystem Guidelines
9. 1  Purpose —  Provide  guidance  for  assembly  and  testing  of  Microfluidic  subsystems,  considering  applicable
performance  and  operating  specifications.    Examples  of  performance  characteristics  are  response  time,  accuracy,
reliability, drydown, and cleanliness.
9. 2  Scope —  These  guidelines  are  limited  to  macro  sealing  and  macro  to  micro  sealing.    It  specifically  excludes
wafer-scale testing.  They address interconnection (fluidic, electrical, and other) of the microfluidic subsystem to the
external system.  They also address interconnection of individual components within the microfluidic subsystem.
9. 3  Assembly and Test Preparation
9. 3.1  Visually  inspect  parts  under  microscope  before  assembly.    Perform  any  testing  possible  at  the  MEMS
component level as characterization or to determine failures before integrating.
9. 3.2  Assemble under hoods or in cleanroom.  Wear gloves.  Use electrostatic protection.  Assembly should be in
the same class environment as required by user.  See SEMI E129.
9. 3.3  Follow  manufacturer’s  instructions  for  tightening  fittings  and  seals  and  connecting  parts.    If  applicable,
measure torque or other assembly parameters.  Subsystem should have means or method to hold part being tightened
to not compromise the structural integrity of the part.
9. 3.4  Seals  used  to  connect  components  should  be  considered  for  thermal  performance,  cleanliness,  and  material
compatibility.  See ¶9.4.?.
9. 3.5  Test systems should have filters installed upstream of the device under test.  Select pore size similar to pore
size used in final application.
9. 4  Verification and Validation
9. 4.1  The following are guidelines for verification and validation.  Some may also apply to production testing.
9. 4.2  Test  for  particles  and  for  other  contamination  characteristics  such  as  moisture  dry  down  as  required  by  end
user as a system.  See ASTM F1394 (particle), SEMI E66 (particle), ASTM F1397 (moisture).
9. 4.3  Test  for  applicable  performance  parameters  such  as  accuracy  using  NIST  traceable  standards.    Time  or
process  response  characterizations  should  model  system  and  connection  volumes,  based  on  specification  designed
for.  If the final application can not be duplicated, consider final system in the data analysis.  For faster process time
minimize volume and surface area between the flow control system and chamber.  Test in gas or liquid that it will be
used with or list substitute/test gas or liquid on test report.
9. 4.4  Cycle parts in environment that they will be used in or in an accelerated mode. This is to model mean time to
failure or other parameters of reliability.  At intervals test for most important performance or operating parameters.
See ASTM F1394, ASTM F1373.
9. 4.5
Leak test mechanical connections using inboard leak detection method.  For positive shut-off components test
for leak across the seat.  Reference SEMI F1.
9. 4.6  Test for performance at maximum and minimum temperatures based on product specifications.
9. 4.7  Test for performance at maximum and minimum pressures (input and output) based on product specifications.
9. 4.8  Test for burst and proof pressures, Reference SEMI E28.</p><p>SEMI PR9-0705 © SEMI 2005 9
9. 4.9  Test for shock and vibration.  Check for operation and leak integrity before and after testing.   MIL-STD 810
9. 4.10  Test for performance at maximum and minimum voltages based on product specifications.
9. 4.11  Perform  electrical  testing  and  validation.    Check  for  power  consumption,  response  time,  noise,  dielectric
breakdown, resistance fluctuations, others?
9. 4.12  Test for compatibility with typical, operating and/or specified fluids for validation testing.

then  each  pellicle  should  be  independently  specified.
For  thicker  photomask  substrates  a  pellicle  is  only
attached  to  the  patterned  side  of  the  photomask.    For
thinner  photomask  substrates  a  pellicle  is  normally
attached  to  both  the  patterned  and  glass  sides  of  the
photomask.
5  Requirements</li><li>1  Film Adhesive ó Film must be sealed on the entire
top  of  the  frame.  Seal  with  a  minimum  of  50%  of  the
frame width at any location.</li><li>2  Frame   Adhesive   ó   Frame   adhesive   must   be
continuous  and  allow  no  gaps  larger  than  the  Defect
Size  Limit  between  pellicle  frame  and  adhesive,  and
between  adhesive  and  photomask  after  attachment.  No
part  of  the  frame  adhesive  may  extend  beyond  the</li></ol><p>SEMI P5-0704 © SEMI 1986, 2004 3
frame  wall,  and  its  edges  must  be  free  of  visually
detectable  stringers  (and  particles).  Adhesive  should
form  a  complete  seal  between  the  frame  and  the  mask
over a minimum of 60% of the width of the frame.
5. 3  Frame  —  Pellicle  frame  must  have  no  visually
detectable     machining     burrs,     discontinuities     in
anodization, or particles.
5. 4  Light Resistance
5. 4.1        For    Broadband    Exposure    Systems    this    is
expressed  by  total  exposure  energy  value  (mj/cm
2
or
j/cm
2
)  on  pellicle  film  until  dropping  1%  of  optical
transmission  of  one  of  the  peak  wavelengths  between
360   nmñ440   nm.      The   test   conditions   (special
characteristics    of    exposure    wavelength,    exposure
energy  between  360  nmñ440  nm,  exposure  conditions,
and  others)  must  be  stated.  Under  these  conditions,  the
pellicle    shall    release    no    material,    which    could
contaminate the photomask or the pellicle itself.
5. 4.2    For  Monochromatic  Exposure  Systems  this  is
expressed  by  total  exposure  energy  value  (mj/cm
2
or
j/cm
2
)  of  specified  wavelength  on  pellicleís  film  until
dropping   0.5%   of   optical   transmission   at   specified
wavelength. Also, the test conditions (half bandwidth of
exposure   specified   wavelength,   energy   of   exposure
specified  wavelength,  exposure  conditions,  and  others)
must be stated. Under these conditions, the pellicle shall
release   no   material,   which   could   contaminate   the
photomask or the pellicle itself.
5. 5  Other  Characteristics  ó  Other  characteristics  of
pellicles are to be determined between the supplier and
the  user.  The  transmission  of  light  for  mask  alignment
is such a characteristic.
6  Measurement Methods
6. 1        Measurement    methods    are    to    be    determined
between  the  user  and  supplier.  General  and  example
methods are as follows:
Optical Transmission: by spectrophotometer
Optical Film Thickness: by spectrophotometer
Thickness  Uniformity:  by  monochromatic  (e.g.,  green)
light
Width  of  Film  Adhesive:  Visual  check  by  minimum
defect sample
Defects:  Visual  check  by  maximum  sample  or  particle
detector
7  Sampling
7. 1  Inspection levels shall be agreed upon between the
user and supplier.
8  Handling
8. 1  Pellicles are to be handled by the frame only.
9  Certification
9. 1    Certification  is  to  be  determined  between  the  user
and supplier.</p><p>NOTICE: SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or

and   ASTM   F   66   is   intended   for   determining   the
kinematic  viscosity  of  photoresists  by  measuring  the
time  for  a  volume  of  liquid  to  flow  under  gravity
through    a    calibrated    glass    capillary    at    a    fixed
temperature.  Efflux  time  is  measured  in  seconds  and
multiplied by the calibration constant of the viscometer
to  obtain  kinematic  viscosity  in  units  of  centistokes
(cSt). Optionally, kinematic viscosity may be multiplied
by  the  density  of  the  photoresist  to  obtain  dynamic
viscosity    in    units    of    centipoise    (cP).    Refer    to
ASTM  D  445  and  F  66  for  additional  information  and

4  Procedure
4. 1      Confirm   that   the   constant   temperature   bath   is
equilibrated to 25.0 ± 0.1°C.
4. 2      Select   a   clean   dry   viscometer   of   appropriate
viscosity  range.  Choose  the  proper  tube  size  for  the
given viscosity so that the efflux time is greater than or
equal to 200 seconds.
4. 3      Charge   the   viscometer   with   photoresist   in   the
manner  dictated  by  the  design  of  the  viscometer  and
wipe clean.
4. 4    Insert  the  viscometer  into  the  clamp  holder  in  the
constant  temperature  bath.  Vertical  alignment  of  the
viscometer is essential for proper flow measurement.
4. 5    Allow  15  minutes  for  the  sample  temperature  to
equilibrate.
4. 6    Use  suction  or  pressure  to  adjust  the  level  of  the
test  sample  to  a  position  in  the  capillary  arm  about  5
mm ahead of the first timing mark.
4. 7      With  the  sample  flowing  freely,  measure  the  time
for  the  meniscus  to  pass  from  the  first  timing  mark  to
the second. Record the time in seconds.
4. 8    Repeat  the  steps  in  Sections  4.6  and  4.7.  (For
reverse  flow  viscometers,  use  the  same  or  another
viscometer  and  begin  with  the  step  in  Section  4.3  for
the second measurement.)
4. 9      The   two   measurements   must   agree   within   0.5
seconds.   If   they   do   not   agree,   then   reject   the
measurement results.
4. 10    After  the  measurement,  the  viscometer  should  be
flushed  several  times  with  a  suitable  solvent  (methyl</p><p>SEMI P7-0997 © SEMI 1982, 2003 2
ethyl  ketone  or  acetone  for  typical  novolac  positive
resists   or   equivalent   and   xylene   for   rubber   based
negative resists or equivalent).
4. 11    Dry  the  tube  by  blowing  dry,  filtered  air  through
the viscometer for a few minutes.
4. 12    The  viscometer  should  periodically  be  cleaned
with chromic acid to remove trace organic deposits.
5  Calculation
5. 1  Average the flow measurements.
5. 2  Kinematic  viscosity  in  cTs  =  Viscometer  constant
× efflux time in seconds.

METHOD FOR THE DETERMINATION OF WATER IN PHOTORESIST
1  Scope</p><ol><li>1   This  method  is  intended  for  th e  application  of  the
Karl  Fischer  titration  to  the  determination  of  water  in
photoresists.   An   electrometric   method   is   used   for
determining  the  endpoint.  The  procedure  is  applicable
to  most  resists  that  have  polymer  and  solvent  systems
fully compatible with Karl Fischer reagent and diluent.
The    resist    manufacturer    should    be    consulted    to
determine  if  this  procedure  can  be  used  with  the  resist
in question.

Remarks — Photoresists which  contain interfering
compounds   (such   as   aldehydes   and   ketones)   may
require    modification    of    the    solvent    or    titration
conditions.  For  further  information,  see  Section  3.4  of
ASTM     Standard     E     203.     For     some     negative
(polyisoprene)  photoresists,  solubility  can  be  improved
by   substituting   ethylene   glycol   as   the   solvent   for
methanol.
