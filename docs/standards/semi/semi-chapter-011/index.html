horizontal  dimensions.  Furthermore,  none  of  these  packages  may  weigh  more  than  Mm  each.  This  paragraph  does
not apply to stockers and AMHS transport equipment.
5. 4.2  Recommendations — Equipment suppliers and device manufacturers might also consider carrier stocker size,
move-in timing, and move-in path during stocker and facility design. Equipment that conforms to these limits may
still be too large to fit into standard truck trailers or aircraft cargo bays.
5. 5  Maintenance Access
5. 5.1  Requirements  —  To  avoid  interfering  with  carrier  transport  systems,  equipment  must  not  require  regularly
scheduled  maintenance  from  the  front.  This  requirement  does  not  apply  to  maintenance  performed  on  user
interfaces, cart-docking interfaces, load ports, carrier buffers, and load locks.
5. 5.2  Recommendations — It is recommended that as little regularly scheduled maintenance as possible be required
from the side.
5. 6  Width vs. Depth
5. 6.1  Recommendations  —  In  general,  to  minimize  the  number  of  bays  required  in  a  fab,  it  is  recommended  that
equipment be designed to minimize width rather than depth.
5. 7  Linked Equipment
5. 7.1  Recommendations  —  To  make  linked  equipment  (such  as  cluster  tools  or  steppers  with  litho  tracks)  jointly
space  efficient,  it  is  recommended  that  they  be  designed  to  minimize  the  cost  footprint  of  the  entire  system  as  a
whole.

NOTICE:  This related information is not an official part of SEMI E72 but  was  approved  for  publication  by  full  letter
ballot procedures.
R1-1   The  maximum  height  of  equipment  in  the  main  fab  was  set  so  that  the  equipment  could  be  installed  in
existing fabs with ceilings just above the equipment height of 3.5 m (11 ft. 5 in) or in fabs with ceiling heights of
3. 66  m  (12  ft.  0  in.)  where  more  clearance  is  provided  for  such  things  as  parts  of  some  overhead  carrier  transport
systems, fire sprinkler systems at the ceiling, and/or extra room for installation of equipment.
R1-2   The  maximum  height  of  equipment  in  the  sub-fab  was  set  so  that  no  part  of  the  equipment  (other  than
connections  to  the  main  fab  area)  sticks  up  into  the  piping  and  duct-work  immediately  under  the  waffle  slab.  In
those cases where a part of the equipment must be taller than 2 m (6 ft. 6 in.), it is recommended that it not be taller
than 2.5 m (8 ft. 2 in.) to stay under the waffle slab.
R1-3   If equipment must have easement space on the side, it is recommended that they be designed in mirror-image
configurations with easement space needed on only one side or the other, so that half of the total easement space on
the sides can be deleted. However, it is recommended that the resulting increase in equipment cost, complexity, and
spare parts inventory be taken into account.
R1-4    Equipment  that  conforms  to  the  limits  given  in  this  standard  may  be  too  large  or  heavy  to  fit  into  buildings
that were originally designed for equipment that processes smaller wafers.</p><p>NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for any

APPLICATION NOTES
NOTE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E73  and  is  not  intended  to  modify  or  supercede  the  official
standard. This related information is optional and contains information that is not required to conform to this standard.
NOTE 1:  While this standard was developed to specify
vacuum  pumps  installed  with  300  mm  equipment,  the
standard  should  also  be  applied  to  vacuum  pumps
installed with 200 mm equipment.
NOTE  2:    Signal  items  for  centralized  supervisory
diagnostics and maintenance could not be standardized,
because  they  are  not  consistent  or  technically  well-
established.     Additional     work     is     required     for
standardization of these signals.
NOTE  3:    In  order  to  save  space  and  reduce  cost,  the
connector  for  the  control  and  running  status  signals
should be the minimum size required for the number of
pins   specified   in   the   standard.   If   additional   signal
connections  are  required,  another  connector  should  be
added to the pump.
NOTE  4:  Utilizing  a  200  VAC  system  (range:  200  to
230 VAC) rather than a 400 VAC system (range: 380 to
480     VAC)     can     lower     costs     associated     with
manufacturing    and    purchasing    pumps.    To    help
minimize  pump  costs,  this  standard  incorporates  AC
supply voltages in the range of 200 to 230 VAC.  Many
400  VAC  systems  are  now  in  use  and  may  be  more
widespread  in  the  future.    However,  standardizing  on
supply voltage of 200 VAC can reduce pump costs now
without  complications  as  long  as  pump  manufactures
accommodate customers requesting 400 VAC units.

SPECIFICATION FOR VACUUM PUMP INTERFACES -
TURBOMOLECULAR PUMPS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Physical  Interfaces  &amp;  Carriers  Committee  and  is
the direct responsibility of the Japanese Physical Interfaces &amp; Carriers Committee. Current edition approved
by  the  Japanese  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  December  1,  2000.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>
January  2001;  to  be  published  March  2001.  Originally  published  June  1998;  previously  published  February
1999.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1   This  standard  specifies  the  phy sical  and  electrical
interfaces    for    turbomolecular    pump    (TMP)    type
vacuum  pumps.    Standardization  of  pump  interfaces
will   allow   for   interchangeability   of   pumps.   Device
manufacturers    use    this    standard    when    procuring
processing   equipment   to   specify   to   the   equipment
supplier  the  interface  required  for  interchangeability  of
pumps.  This  document  is  also  used  by  semiconductor
processing  equipment  suppliers  to  specify  standardized
interfaces to pump suppliers.
2   Scope</li><li>1   This  standard  applies  to  vacuu m  pumps  supplied
with 300 mm semiconductor processing equipment.</li><li>2    The   standard   specifies   the   mec hanical   and
electrical     interfaces     for     turbomolecular     pumps,

Scope of Standardized Interface</li><li>3   This  standard  does  not  purport   to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1   This  standard  is  not  intended  t o  dictate  how  to
build a vacuum pump, but to specify interfaces that will
allow for interchangeability of individual pumps.</li><li>2   This  standard  does  not  include   specifications  for
sensor-bus compliant interfaces.</li><li>3   This  standard  is  not  intended  t o  address  design
issues  related  to  safety  considerations  and  containment
issues  which  are  addressed  elsewhere  in  the  SEMI
guidelines.</li><li>4  International, national and loca l codes, regulations
and   laws   should   be   consulted   to   ensure   that   the
equipment   meets   regulatory   requirements   in   each
location of use.</li><li>5   This  standard  does  not  apply  to   turbomolecular
pumps less than 300 l/s or greater than 3000 l/s. Pumps
less  than  300  l/s  are  too  small  and  pumps  greater  than
3000 l/s pumps are not commonly used.</li><li>6  Double flow turbomechanical  pumps are excepted
from  this  standard,  because  their  shapes  and  structures
are  different  from  turbomolecular  pumps  to  be  applied
this standard.

GUIDE FOR 300 mm PROCESS EQUIPMENT POINTS OF
CONNECTION TO FACILITY SERVICES
This  Guide  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Facilities  Committee  and  is  the  direct  responsibility  of
the  North  American  Facilities  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North  American  Regional
Standards Committee on August 15, 1998. Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> January 1999; to be published
February 1999. Originally published September 1998.
This document replaces E76-0998 in its entirety.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1    Factory   design   variations   make   it   difficult   for
equipment   manufacturers   to   predict   or   agree   on
consistent points of connection for hookup of equipment
to   facility   services.   Similarly,   device   manufacturers
cannot easily pre-facilitate their factories for equipment
because   the   connections   on   the   equipment   are   not
consistently   located.   Standardization   of   connection
locations     and     utilizing     pre-facilitation     strategies
decreases  the  cost  of  and  time  required  for  equipment
installation.</li><li>2   This  document  is  a  guide  for  300  mm  equipment
manufacturers    to    define    the    positioning    of    the
equipment  points  of  connection  (EPOC),  required  on
semiconductor   processing   equipment   for   hookup   to
facility    utility    services.    The    document    identifies
locations    for    the    EPOC’s    and    provides    EPOC
consistency   recommendations   that   should   allow   for
efficient    equipment    installation.    In    addition,    this
document   defines   strategies   to   support   the   device
manufacturer’s  ability  to  pre-facilitate  the  utility  point
of  connection  (UPOC).  Recommendations  for  supplier-
provided EPOC documentation are also included.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This guide addresses three areas that are necessary
to improve the efficiency of  and reduce the duration  of
equipment installations.
a) Recommendations  for  EPOC  location,  grouping,
consistency and reduction to increase confidence in
the   accuracy   and   repeatability   of   EPOC’s,   and
reduce  the  amount  of  work  required  to  hookup
equipment.  As  a  result,  device  manufacturers  can
employ   standard   pre-facilitation   strategies   and
increase the efficiency of equipment installation.
b) Pre-facilitation  recommendations  that  provide  the
ability  for  UPOC’s  to  be  efficiently  and  accurately
installed prior to equipment delivery, thus allowing
immediate  hook-up  of  the  equipment  upon  arrival
in  the  wafer  fab.  This  includes  recommendations
for   jigs,   templates,   mating   pedestal   bases,   and
associated interface panels.
c) Documentation recommendations to be required by
the   device   manufacturer   and   provided   by   the
equipment   supplier   relative   to   EPOC   location,
group,  consistency,  pre-facilitation  strategies  and
hardware.  This  includes  additional  documentation
recommended  to  support  equipment  installations
but not directly related to EPOC’s.</li><li>2    This   guide   applies   to   300   mm   semiconductor
processing    equipment    and    any    supplier-provided
support equipment for installation into new factories.</li><li>3  The following groups of utilities are covered in this
guide.
• Electrical Power
• Data communications
• Exhaust and other process effluents
• Process fluids (liquids and gases)
• Support equipment interconnects</li><li>4   The  primary  focus  for  this  guide  is  hookup  of
semiconductor  processing  equipment  including  but  not
limited to the following equipment types.
• Etch equipment (Dry and Wet)
• Film  deposition  equipment  (CVD,  PVD  and
Plating)
• Thermal equipment
• Surface prep and clean
• Photolithography    equipment    (Stepper    and
Tracks)
• Chemical Mechanical Polishing equipment
• Ion Implant equipment
• Metrology equipment

6  EPOC Recommendations
6. 1  Equipment Point of Connection Locations
6. 1.1    Table   1,   EPOC   Location   Recommendations
identifies  the  locations  for  the  specified  facility  utility
services.  The  locations  noted  apply  to  all  equipment
types,   as   listed   in   the   document   scope,   and   all
equipment  configurations  including  but  not  limited  to
boxed    equipment,    linked    equipment,    and    cluster
equipment.
6. 1.2    Bottom   Location   Plane:   Facility   services   are
typically  provided  from  the  subfab  below  the  waffle
slab. The bottom location of EPOC’s  allows for straight
up  routing  of  supply  lines,  thus  reducing  equipment
footprint   and   easing   facilitation.   The   locations   of
EPOC’s need to be readily accessible to facilitate hook-
up to the UPOC (i.e., accessible from the back or sides).
(See Table 1.)
6. 1.3   Back  Location  Plane:  If  the  bottom  location
plane option is not utilized for hookup, EPOC’s should
be  on  back  plane  of  equipment  just  above  the  raised
floor. (See Table 1.)
6. 2  Equipment Point of Connection Groups
6. 2.1    Equipment   points   of   connection   should   be
grouped  together  by  service  type  to  ensure  ease  of
hookup   and   qualification   of   the   equipment.   The
following   groups   should   be   considered   during   the
configuration of the equipment.
a) Electrical  Power  Connections    Includes  but
is not limited to connections for main electrical
utility power supply.
b) Data      Communications      Connections      
Includes  but  is  not  limited  to  factory  systems,
automated    material    handling    system,    and
support  equipment  communication  cables  and
interface connectors.
c) Gas  Delivery  System  Connections    Includes
but   is   not   limited   to   fittings   for   bulk   and
specialty gas lines.
d) Liquid    Delivery    System    Connections    
Includes but is not limited to fittings for liquid
chemical,   slurry,   ultra   pure   water,   process
cooling  water,  temperature  control  unit  fluids,
and industrial water lines.
e) Equipment  Effluent  Connections    Includes
but  is  not  limited  to  fittings  for  exhaust,  drain,
and vacuum lines.
f) Life    and    Safety    System    Connections    
Includes  but  is  not  limited  to  fire  protection,
leak detection, emergency machine off (EMO),
and hazard warning systems.
6. 2.2   A  hierarchy  should  be  adhered  to  when  locating
these   groups   of   connections   on   equipment.   Data
communication wiring should be routed separately from
power  wiring  and  connections.  Radio  frequency  (RF)
interconnects  should  be  routed  and  grouped  separately.
All electrical and electronic wiring should be away from
and above water and drain lines.
6. 3  Equipment Point of Connection Consistency
6. 3.1   This  section  provides  key  elements  to  ensure  the
required   consistency   of   the   equipment   points   of
connection.   Connection   locations   on   the   equipment</p><p>SEMI E76-0299 

 SEMI 1998, 1999
5
should be consistent with those defined in the Facilities
Interface  Specification  and  should  not  deviate  from
equipment   to   equipment   of   a   specific   model   and
revision. EPOC tolerances need to be +/- 6.35 mm (+/-
1/4 inch) in all directions as measured from the supplier
defined   equipment   datum   point.   Tighter   tolerances
should be considered for inflexible or difficult to move
hookups such as large diameter (over 2 inch) exhaust or
water  lines.  Connector  sizes  and  types  should  match
exactly.
6. 3.2   Table  2  -  EPOC  Consistency  Recommendations
identify  equipment  variations  and  levels  of  consistency
required  for  equipment  points  of  connection  location,
connector type and size.
6. 3.3   In  Table  2,  the  term  “Should  Match”  identifies
areas  that  have  traditionally  been  the  most  costly  and
where   significant   gains   can   be   made   in   achieving
installation   efficiency   .   The   term   “Could   Match”
identifies  areas  where  modest  gains  can  be  made  in
installation efficiency .
6. 4  Equipment Point of Connection Reduction
6. 4.1    The   number   of   connection   points   to   the
equipment  should  be  kept  to  a  minimum.  The  EPOC’s
located on wafer processing equipment should follow a
strategy  commonly  referred  to  as  single  line  drops,
where there is only one point of connection per service
per  piece  of  equipment.  Where  feasible,  distribution  of
a particular facility (e.g., chilled water, waste drains for
the   same   type   of   chemicals)   should   be   distributed
through    internal    manifolding.    Internal    equipment
manifolding    should    be    configured    to    allow    for
configurable    equipment    sub-systems    like    process
chambers and gas panels. In addition to manifolding, all
other  interface  box  functions  should  be  configured  on-
board the equipment this includes any required shut-off
valves,   regulators,   filters,   QC   sample   valves   and
pressure indicators.
6. 5  Equipment Point of Connection Interface Panel
6. 5.1   Once  EPOC  locations  and  groupings  have  been
defined  and  standardized  for  purposes  of  consistency,
the supplier could utilize an interface panel concept for
simplifying  equipment  hook-up.  The  interface  panel
should  consist  of  a  physical  panel  that  becomes  part  of
the   permanent   equipment   installation.   All   EPOC’s
should  be  comprehended  in  the  layout  of  the  interface
panel    using    the    recommendations    for    location,
grouping,  and  consistency  as  discussed  in  Sections  6.1,
6. 2,  and  6.3.  The  supplier  should  design  a  standard
interface  panel  layout  that  supports  a  given  equipment
type and all associated revisions.
6. 5.2    Common   connector   technologies,   types,   and
sizes   should   be   utilized   along   with   provisions   for
containment     of     hazardous     materials.     Typically,
hazardous     production     material     connections     are
contained within the equipment
6. 5.3   Spacing  of  multiple  gas  and  liquid  connections
on  the  interface  panel  should  provide  sufficient  access
and   spacing   for   installation   and   maintenance   for
multiple  lines  (i.e.,  orbital  weld  head,  wrench,  and  test
fittings).
7  Pre-facilitation Recommendations
7. 1   The  pre-facilitation  strategy  should  provide  the
device  manufacturer  with  the  ability  to  efficiently  and
accurately  install  UPOC’s  prior  to  equipment  delivery,
allowing  immediate  hook-up  of  the  equipment  upon
arrival   to   the   fab.   The   equipment   supplier   should
provide  a  template  and/or  jig,  as  well  as  a  EPOC
interface    panel    (if    applicable)    or    pre-facilitation
pedestal  prior  to  the  equipment  delivery  as  part  of  a
strategy  to  support  accurate  pre-facilitation  of  utility
points  of  connection.  In  situations  where  a  pedestal  is
being  utilized  (see  Section  7.4),  the  pedestal  can  serve
as  an  aide  to  pre-facilitation.  The  supplier  and  device
manufacturer  should  discuss  and  agree  on  the  chosen
strategy.
7. 2     Templates:    The    template    provides    a    two-
dimensional  guide  that  projects  EPOC  locations  to  a
two-dimensional surface, typically the floor. This would
allow  the  device  manufacturer  to  open  popouts,  core
holes, etc., and pre-facilitate to a point close to, but not
necessarily  including,  the  UPOC.  See  Figure  1  for  a
representative example of a Template.
7. 3   Jigs:  The  jig  provides  a  guide  that  locates  the  -
EPOC’s  in  three-dimensional  space.  This  would  allow
the device manufacturer to pre-facilitate to the UPOC’s
or  at  least  prefabricate  the  facility  lines  and  UPOC’s
such    that    final    hookup    could    be    accomplished
immediately  after  setting  the  equipment.  See  Figure  2
for a representative example of a Jig.
7. 4    Pre-facilitation   Pedestal:   Application   notes   and
three   representative   examples   of   using   pedestals   to
support   pre-facilitation   are   included   in   the   related
information section at the end of this document.</p><p>SEMI E76-0299

RELATED INFORMATION 1
Pre-facilitation Pedestal
Application Notes
NOTE: This related information was balloted, but is not
an  official  part  of  SEMI  E76  and  is  not  intended  to
modify  or  supersede  the  official  standard.  It  has  been
derived  from  the  work  of  the  originating  task  force.
Determination of the suitability of the material is solely
the responsibility of the user.
NOTE:  This  is  only  a  representative  example,  a  pre-
facilitation pedestal can be of an open frame or enclosed
box  design.  Due  to  bay  design  and  pass  thru  hole
locations a pedestal leg may sometimes become located
over  an  opening    thus,  a  design  that  allows  flexible  leg
or foot locations should be incorporated.
Figure R1-1
Pre-facilitation Pedestal Example
R1-1.  Pre-facilitation Pedestal
R1-1.1  A pedestal provides a permanent base or frame
to  support  the  equipment  and  could  be  considered  an
extension  of  the  equipment  mainframe  In  addition,  the
pedestal   could   emulate   a   docking   station   concept
whereby   all   utilities   points   of   connection   could   be
located and installed prior to equipment delivery. Once
the  equipment  is  set  on  this  pre-facilitation  pedestal,
hookup   is   relatively   quick   and   easy.   When   a   pre-
facilitation    pedestal    is    used,    both    the    device
manufacturer    and    supplier    should    agree    who    is
responsible for coordinating space utilization within the
pedestal.
R1-1.2    When  pre-facilitation  pedestals  are  used,  the
physical  location  of  the  EPOC’s  and  corresponding
UPOC’s  can  be  determined  by  utilizing  templates,  jigs,
and/or  EPOC  interface  panels  in  conjunction  with  the
pedestal.  The  facility  utility  lines  can  be  prefabricated
and   installed   to   the   UPOC’s   prior   to   setting   the
equipment  on  the  pre-facilitation  pedestal.  See  Figure
R1-1  for  a  representative  example  of  a  Pre-facilitation
Pedestal.
R1-1.3  The pre-facilitation pedestal should be provided
by   the   equipment   supplier   and   standardized   for   a
equipment  type.  In  addition,  the  equipment  supplier  is
responsible for providing the engineering and design of
the pre-facilitation pedestal (with input from the device
manufacturer   as   required).   Installation   of   hardware
within     the     pedestal     should     be     done     during
manufacturing  or  during  pre-facilitation.  The  following
pedestal features (as required by the equipment supplier
and   end   user)   are   the   responsibility   of   the   pre-
facilitation pedestal supplier.
a) Vibration       isolation,       leveling,       seismic
reinforcing,    and    load    distribution    point
loading.
b) Connection  points  from  the  pedestal  to  the
facility   which   can   be   from   any   plane   but
should    take    into    consideration    potential
interference with adjacent tools.
c) Routing  of  the  plumbing  and  harnesses  within
the pedestal.
d) Containment  of  gases  and  liquids  within  the
pedestal, including possible HPM.
e) Support   equipment   interconnects   within   the
pedestal
R1-1.4  To use the pre-facilitation pedestal, the distance
from  the  highest  point  on  the  waffle  slab  to  the  bottom
of  equipment  (typically  the  top  of  the  raised  floor)
should be equal to or greater than 0.6 meters (2 feet).
R1-1.5    The  pre-facilitation  pedestal  is  recommended
for use when these conditions apply.
a) connections   located   on   the   bottom   of   the
equipment,
b) maintenance   access   to   the   bottom   of   the
equipment as required,
c) repair  and  spilled  liquids  access  is  required
underneath the equipment,
d) pedestal is required as an appropriate structural
base to set the equipment on,</p><p>SEMI E76-0299

10
e) large   footprint   and/or   multiple   module   for
equipment,
f) large  number  of  connections  required  for  the
equipment (more than 10), and
g) peripheral    components    for    the    equipment
(pumps,   RF   generators,   chiggers,   etc.)   are
typically  located  beneath  the  equipment  in  a
subfab area.
R1-1.6          The     pre-facilitation     pedestal     is     not
recommended for use when these conditions apply.
a) small table mounted equipment,
b) no more than one connection on the bottom of
the equipment,
c) other connections located on back, top, or side,
d) no maintenance, repair, or spill clean up access
requirements beneath equipment,
e) few connections required (less than 10), and
f) few  if  any  peripheral  components  required  or
located below equipment in subfab area.
R1-1.7  These conditions are only recommendations and
dialog  between  the  supplier  and  device  manufacturer  is
recommended to determine if a pre-facilitation pedestal
is necessary or beneficial for a specific application.
R1-1.8    The  Figure  R1-2  shows  the  facility  utility  lines
running  up  through  the  waffle  slab  directly  underneath
the  equipment.  The  UPOC  -  EPOC  connections  occurs
at the EPOC interface panel which is located on the top
plane  of  the  pre-facilitation  pedestal.  This  concept  is
preferred  by  device  manufacturers  as  the  number  of
connections   are   minimized,   no   additional   space   is
required  on  the  sides  or  in  back  of  the  equipment  for
routing, and the HPM lines can be pre-facilitation to the
UPOC without additional connections or special double
containment requirements.

R1-1.9    The  Figure  R1-3  also  shows  the  facility  line
running  through  the  waffle  slab  directly  underneath  the
equipment.  In  addition,  this  example  depicts  situations
where   there   is   a   physical   requirement   to   manifold
connections   underneath   the   equipment.   The   same
advantages  as  Example  #1  apply  with  the  exception  of
minimizing    the    number    of    connections    to    the
equipment.
R1-1.10  The Figure R1-4 shows the facility utility lines
running  up  through  the  waffle  slab  to  the  side/back  of
the pre-facilitation pedestal and connecting to the EPOC
interface  panel  mounted  on  the  side/back  of  the  pre-
facilitation  pedestal.  In  this  example  a  short  section  of
line  is  required  to  complete  the  connection  from  the
EPOC  interface  panel  to  the  connection  within  the
equipment  itself.  This  short  section  of  line  should  be
prefabricated  such  that  final  hookup  to  the  equipment
can be accomplished quickly once the equipment is set.
It  is  important  to  note  that  this  option  requires  careful
consideration on how to accommodate HPM lines. It is
generally  undesirable  to  have  additional  connections  in
HPM  lines  or  to  design  the  pre-facilitation  pedestal
itself    to    provide    secondary    containment.    In    this
example,  the  equipment  supplier  is  responsible  for  the
volume  in  the  pre-facilitation  pedestal  to  route  and
manifold the plumbing as required</p><p>SEMI E76-0299

TEST METHOD FOR CALCULATION OF CONVERSION FACTORS FOR
A MASS FLOW CONTROLLER USING SURROGATE GASES
This test method was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility of
the North American Gases Committee.  Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards
Committee  on  July  11,  2004.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  September  2004;  to  be  published
November 2004.  Originally published September 1998.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  The  purpose  of  this  test  method  is  to  quantify  a
nominal  average  conversion  factor  from  one  gas  to
another  for  an  MFC  and  to  quantify  the  conversion
factor as function of flow for an MFC.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This procedure describes a method to determine the
MFC   conversion   factor   and   function   between   two
gases.</li><li>2  This   document   provides   a   common   basis   for
communication between manufacturers and users.</li><li>3  The  intent  of  this  document  is  not  to  suggest  any
specific testing program, but to specify the test method
to  be  used  when  testing  for  parameters  covered  by  this
method.    Reference  operating  conditions  represent  the
environmental conditions where the “best” performance
can be expected.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  It is not practical to evaluate performance under all
possible  combinations  of  operating  conditions.    This
test   procedure   should   be   applied   under   laboratory
(reference)  conditions;  its  intent  is  to  collect  sufficient
data to form a judgment of the field performance of the
MFC being tested.</li><li>1.1  The    results    from    this    test    represent    the
performance  of  the  specific  device  tested  (i.e.,  make,
model,  full  scale  flow  and  operating  conditions).    The
results    may    not    apply    to    devices    of    different
manufacture,  model,  full  scale  flow  or  under  different
operating conditions.</li><li>2  This  procedure  does  not  apply  to  pressure  based
MFC.

6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1  Gas  flow  and  setpoint  data  are  collected  for  two
gases.  This data is reduced to quantify the relationship
between the flow measurement by the MFC on one gas
to another gas.
6. 2  This   method   allows   the   user   to   determine   the
conversion  factor  between  two  gases  for  the  MFC  and
to determine the onset of errors in the MFC calibration
due to the conversion factor/function effects.
7  Interferences
7. 1  The  accuracy  rating  of  the  measuring  equipment
shall  be  superior  to  that  of  the  D.U.T.    Preferably  the
measuring equipment will have an accuracy that is four
times  better  than  the  D.U.T.    Calibration  equipment
must have a valid calibration certificate.
7. 2  Take   care   when   using   test   instruments   with   a
specified accuracy expressed in percent of full scale.
7. 3  Installation    effects    on    the    flow    should    be
minimized.    Monitor  pressure  upstream  of  the  D.U.T.
to   ensure   that   flow   variations   due   to   pressure   are
minimized.
7. 4  Verify   electrical   signals   directly   at   the   D.U.T.
connector  to  ensure  that  the  signals  at  the  D.U.T.    and
standard  agree  with  the  signals  at  the  data  recording
equipment.
7. 5  Certain  gases  will  contaminate  the  D.U.T.    This
test  should  be  considered  a  destructive  test  in  such
cases.
7. 6  All  electrical  measurements  should  be  read  on
devices  with  at  least  4.5  digits  of  resolution.    These
devices must have valid calibration certifications.
7. 7  The    device    mounting    position    must    be    in
accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications.

10  Safety Precautions
10. 1  This    test    method    may    involve    hazardous
materials, operations, and equipment.  This test method
does  not  purport  to  address  the  safety  considerations
associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the
user to establish appropriate safety and health practices
and   to   determine   the   applicability   of   regulatory
limitations before using this method.
10. 2  Follow   the   manufacturer’s   specifications   and
instructions  for  installation  and  operation  whenever
possible.  Note any exceptions in the test report.
11  Test Specimen
11. 1  Allow  all  components  in  the  test  apparatus  to
warm up following the manufacturer’s specification.
11. 2  Take  necessary  steps  when  switching  gases  to
ensure  that  only  the  desired  gas  is  in  the  D.U.T.    and
flow standard at the time the test is performed.</p><p>SEMI E77-1104 © SEMI 1998, 2004 3
12  Preparation of Apparatus
12. 1  Locate  the  D.U.T.    in  the  test  environment  to
stabilize temperature for 24 hours prior to warm up.
12. 2  The  reference  operating  conditions  shall  be  as
follows:
12. 2.1  Ambient Temperature — 23 ± 2°C
12. 2.2  Gas  Temperature  —  Same  as  ambient.    In  the
case  of  a  condensible  gas,  the  gas  temperature  should
be maintained as a gradient, with highest temperature at
the  outlet  end  of  the  test  set  up,  and  slightly  reduced
temperatures  back  to  the  source.    This  will  ensure  that
condensing vapors do not accumulate in the test set up.
Gradient   should   simulate   actual   process   parameters
where the MFC will be installed.
12. 2.3  Ambient Pressure — 101.3 kPa (+ 4.7 or – 15.3
kPa)
12. 2.4  Gas  Pressure,  Inlet  —  172  ±  34  kPa  unless  the
gas  is  not  capable  of  delivering  this  pressure,  then
normal fab operating conditions should be observed.
12. 2.5  Gas Pressure, Outlet — &lt; 80 kPa
12. 2.6  Relative    Humidity    —    40%    ±    5%,    non-
condensing (suggestion: record if outside this range)
12. 2.7  Magnetic Field — ≤ 50 μT
12. 2.8  Electromagnetic Field — ≤ 100 μV/m
12. 2.9  Vibration — ≤ 0.5 m/s at 50 to 200 Hz
12. 3  Following  the  conditioning  period  (See  Section
12. 1), warm up the device according to manufacturer’s
specifications.
12. 4  Perform  an  adequate  nitrogen  purge  to  ensure  all
previous  gases  and  moisture  have  been  removed  from
the  system.    Prior  to  corrosive  gas  testing,  a  cyclic
pump and purge operation is recommended, alternately
backfilling   with   nitrogen,   and   evacuating   the   test
manifold.
12. 5  Leak    check    the    manifold,    using    available
methodologies  to  verify  the  test  system  leak  integrity.
Introduce  the  test  gas  at  a  sufficient  rate  and  time  to
ensure  the  test  apparatus  is  completely  filled  with  the
test gas and only the test gas.
12. 6  Record  the  zero  offset  with  line  pressure  inside
the  MFC  to  best  simulate  normal  operating  conditions.
Line  pressure  during  testing  is  to  be  170.30  kPa  (24.7
psia)  unless  safety  practices  for  the  gas  under  test
dictate that a lower line pressure be used.
NOTE 1:  In  addition,  if  this  test  is  performed  on  hazardous
gases,   bleeding   off   gas   pressure   to   obtain   atmospheric
pressure inside the MFC may not be easy to do.
12. 7  Command  100%,  and  establish  flow,  then  close
the downstream isolation valve; then close the upstream
isolation valve (see Figure 1).
12. 8  With  both  isolation  valves  closed,  and  a  100%
setpoint  wait  until  the  pressure  drop  across  the  MFC  is
dissipated,  ensuring  a  “no  flow”  condition  through  the
MFC.    Dissipation  of  the  pressure  across  the  MFC  is
indicated  when  the  indicated  flow  drops  to  a  steady
state value near zero.
12. 9  After the electrical output signal has stabilized for
at  least  three  minutes,  record  the  MFC  zero  offset  in
Table 1.</p><p>Figure 1

manufacturer’s  procedure.    This  may  entail  automatic
re-zeroing  of  the  device,  or  may  require  an  adjustment
by the operator.</li><li>11  Record the adjusted zero reading in Table 1.</li><li>12  The  reference  supply  conditions  used  shall  be
the reference values specified by the manufacturer.  For
those  instances  when  a  range  of  values  is  specified
rather than a reference value, the midpoint of the range
shall be taken to be the reference value.</li><li>13  The  power  supply  must  be  sufficiently  rated  for
the device under test.  In addition, the following supply
conditions and tolerances shall apply reference voltage:</li><li>13.1  AC Supply — ± 1%</li><li>13.2  DC Supply — ± 0.1%</li><li>13.3  Reference Frequency — ± 0.1 Hz</li><li>13.4  Harmonic Distortion of AC Supply — ≤ 1%</li><li>13.5  Ripple of DC Supply — ≤ 0.1% rms
13  Procedure</li><li>1  For  the  gas  of  interest,  collect  flow  data  for  five
cycles  of  11  different  setpoints.    The  setpoints  are
100%,  90%,  80%,  70%,  60%,  50%,  40%,  30%,  20%,
10%, and 0% of full scale.  Begin collecting data at the
50%  level  then  60%,  70%  and  so  on.    Record  the  data
on the form in Table 1.</li><li>1.1  When  a  non-zero  setpoint  is  given,  allow  the
MFC  to  stabilize  at  the  desired  setpoint  by  observing
the reading on the flow standard.  Record the data once
the MFC has stabilized at the current setpoint.
NOTE 2:  If, during data acquisition at a nominal setpoint, the
instrument  fails  to  stabilize,  the  D.U.T.    is  not  stable  enough
for the test to proceed.</li><li>1.2  When  a  zero  setpoint  is  given,  perform  the
procedure   described   in   Sections   12.7–12.9   (do   not
rezero   the   MFC)   to   ensure   a   “no-flow”   condition
through  the  MFC  and  record  the  zero  offset  indicated
by the MFC’s output in Table 1.</li><li>2  Use Table 1 to record the following:</li><li>2.1  Column A — D.U.T.  setpoint (% F.S.)</li><li>2.2  Column B — D.U.T.  flow indication (% F.S.)</li><li>2.3  Column C — Raw flow standard reading (sccm)
14  Calculations or Interpretation of Results</li><li>1  For each test gas, calculate the mean and standard
deviation  of  the  corrected  flow  readings,  for  common
setpoints  on  the  same  gas.    For  example,  calculate  the
mean and standard deviation for all the 0% readings for
a  given  gas,  then  repeat  the  calculations  for  the  10%
readings, etc.  Record the results on Table 2 in Columns
B and C.  Plot the result as illustrated in Figure 2.</li></ol><p>SEMI E77-1104 © SEMI 1998, 2004 7

ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND
CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND
ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT
This guide was technically approved by the Global Metrics Committee and is the direct responsibility of the
North  American  Metrics  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North  American  Regional  Standards
Committee  on  August  29,  2002.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  September  2002;  to  be  published
November 2002.  Originally published September 1998.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1    The  purpose  of  this  document  is  to  minimize  the
negative impact on productivity caused by static charge
in  semiconductor  manufacturing  environments.  It  is  a
guide   for   establishing   electrostatic   compatibility   of
equipment used in semiconductor manufacturing.</li><li>2    Electrostatic  surface  charge  causes  a  number  of
undesirable   effects   in   semiconductor   manufacturing
environments.  Electrostatic  discharge  (ESD)  damages
both   products   and   reticles.   ESD   events   also   cause
electromagnetic    interference    (EMI),    resulting    in
equipment   malfunctions.   Charged   wafer   and   reticle
surfaces   attract   particles   (electrostatic   attraction   or
ESA)  and  increase  the  defect  rate.  Charge  on  products
can  also  result  in  equipment  malfunction  or  product
breakage.  Operating  problems  and  additional  product
defects due to static charge can have a negative impact
on     the     cost     of     ownership     of     semiconductor
manufacturing equipment (refer to SEMI E35).</li><li>3  An increasing amount of semiconductor production
is  done  in  minienvironments  or  within  the  production
equipment.  The  majority  of  static  related  problems
occur  while  the  product  is  in  its  carriers,  or  being
transferred from them, by the production equipment.</li><li>4    Static  control  methods  can  be  incorporated  in  the
equipment  design  to  reduce  static  charge  to  acceptable
levels.  This  guide  will  be  used  primarily  by  equipment
manufacturers  during  the  design  of  their  equipment.
There  are  test  methods  available  (see  Sections  6  and  7
of  this  guide)  to  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  the
static control methods. The end user will be able to use
the  same  test  methods  to  verify  compliance  with  an
equipment purchase specification.
2  Scope</li><li>1    The  scope  of  this  document  is  limited  to  methods
of   measurement   and   a   guide   for   the   maximum
recommended level of static charge on:
• Product or reticles,
• Carriers, and
• Parts  of  the  input/exit  ports  of  equipment  and
minienvironments.</li><li>2      This   document   presents   a   matrix   of   maximum
recommended   levels   of   static   charge   on   products,
reticles,   carriers,   and   the   input   and   exit   ports   of
production    equipment    or    minienvironments.    The
purpose is to:
• Reduce  product,  reticle,  and  equipment  damage
due to ESD,
• Reduce  equipment  lock-up  problems  due  to  ESD
events, and
• Reduce   the   attraction   of   particles   to   charged
surfaces.</li><li>3    This  document  references  SEMI  E43  and  other
methods     of     measuring     static     charge.     Related
Information  1  of  this  document  contains  a  theoretical
investigation  of  electrostatic  particle  attraction,  as  well
as     case     histories     from     users     and     equipment
manufacturers    as    to    the    static    charge    problems
encountered and how they were solved. A bibliography
of  related  technical  papers  is  also  included.  Related
Information    2    describes    static    control    methods
commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing.</li><li>4    This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  Static     Measurements     ó     Measurements     of
electrostatic  quantities  such  as  charge,  electric  field,
and  voltage  are  difficult  to  make.  The  nature  of  the
object   (insulator   or   conductor),   its   geometry,   its
surroundings,  and  the  measuring  equipment  itself,  are
only  a  few  of  the  factors  affecting  the  accuracy  of  an
electrostatic measurement.</li><li>1.1  Similarly, it is difficult to relate the measurement
of  an  electrostatic  quantity  to  its  effect  on  products  or
equipment.  For  example,  an  ESD  simulator  produces  a
standardized  discharge  waveform  when  a  capacitor  is</li></ol><p>SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 2002 2
discharged  at  a  known  voltage.  This  device  is  used  to
establish  the  ESD  damage  threshold  for  semiconductor
products, or the effect of ESD on equipment. While the
amount  of  charge  transferred  is  known  (q  =  CV),  the
maximum   current   that   results   is   not.   There   is   no
guarantee   that   the   same   amount   of   charge   would
produce   the   same   results   if   different   values   of
capacitance and voltage were used.
3. 2  Location   ó   The   test   methods   and   maximum
recommended   levels   of   static   charge   on   product,
reticles,  and  carriers  are  meant  to  be  applied  at  the
input/exit  ports  of  production  equipment,  and  when
possible  within  the  equipment.  This  document  is  not
meant to be applied in any way that affects the process
within the equipment.
3. 3  Test  Methods  ó  The  test  methods  referenced  in
this  document  do  not  guarantee  precise  measurements
of  static  charge  levels.  The  maximum  static  charge
levels   recommended   in   this   document   have   large
tolerances. (See Section 15.1.)
3. 4  Static  Charge  Control  ó  There  are  a  variety  of
static  related  issues  in  a  semiconductor  manufacturing
environment.  The  issues  are  complex  due  to  the  wide
range    of    electrostatic    problems,    and    device    or
equipment  sensitivities  to  these  problems.  This  guide
contains   general   recommendations.   Users   of   this
document   are   cautioned   that   specific   static   related
problems may require or allow different levels of static
charge than are recommended in this document.

6  Requirements
6. 1  Measurement  Methods  and  Instrumentation  ó  No
single method of testing for static charge can determine
a   ìsafeî   level.   The   amount   of   static   charge,   the
distribution of static charge on an object, and the nature
of  the  static  discharge  will  all  interact  to  determine  if
the charge level is safe. It will be difficult to determine
levels that guarantee static related problems are totally
eliminated. The goal of this guide is to assist the user in
identifying static charge levels likely to cause problems
in  process  equipment.  This  guide  should  provide  the
user  with  enough  insight  to  define  a  test  methodology
for each static problem and understand its limitations.
6. 2  ESD Damage
6. 2.1      When   considering   direct   ESD   damage   to   an
object  (product,  reticle,  or  equipment),  the  important
parameter   is   the   current   accompanying   the   charge
transfer  to  or  from  the  object.  Under  a  fixed  set  of  test
parameters, the damaging amount of current due to the
charge transfer to or from the object can be determined.
Established   test   methods   exist   for   determining   the
threshold   of   damage   to   a   particular   object.   ESD
simulators  of  various  types  are  used  for  this  purpose.
Refer   to   EOS/ESD   Association   Standards   listed   in
Section  4  for  further  information  concerning  device
testing.
6. 2.2  The end user should determine what is damaging
current   level   due   to   charge   transfer   to   product   or
reticles  that  will  be  handled  in  a  particular  piece  of
production equipment.
6. 2.3  In the context of production equipment, it appears
important   to   know   the   charge   on   the   product,   its
carriers,   and   any   other   objects   that   might   directly
contact  the  product.  Charge  is  measured  in  coulombs,
or more conveniently in nanocoulombs (10
-9
coulombs)
for   this   purpose.   The   measurement   is   made   with
instrumentation  known  as  a  Faraday  Cup,  as  shown  in
Section 7, Figure 1.
6. 2.4    A  charged  object,  like  an  integrated  circuit,  is
placed in the Faraday Cup and a reading is taken of the
charge on it. It will be necessary to obtain an instrument
with  a  large  enough  ìcupî  for  wafers,  cassettes,  and
other  equipment  parts.  It  will  also  be  necessary  to  get
the  objects  into  the  cup  without  altering  their  charge
levels.     Further     information     on     making     these
measurements     should     be     available     from     the
manufacturers of the measuring equipment.
6. 2.5        The    user    should    determine    with    an    ESD
simulator  what  levels  of  ESD  cause  product,  or  reticle
damage.   The   equipment   manufacturer   will   need   to
determine  with  an  ESD  simulator  what  levels  of  static
charge cause equipment damage.
6. 2.6    It  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  equipment
manufacturer  to  demonstrate  that  equipment  operation
does  not  generate  more  than  the  allowable  amount  of
charge  on  product,  carriers  or  equipment  parts.  This  is
shown in Section 7, Figure 2.
6. 3  Particle Attraction
6. 3.1    Electrostatic  attraction  (ESA)  of  particles  can
occur due to the electrostatic field created by the charge
on the surface of an object. Both the field strength and,
usually  to  a  lesser  degree,  the  divergence  of  the  field
influence   the   electrostatic   contribution   to   particle
deposition   velocity.   Electrostatic   particle   deposition
velocity   also   depends   on   particle   size   and   particle
electrical  charge.  Unfortunately,  even  under  controlled
laboratory    conditions,    accurate    measurements    of
electric  field  strength,  particle  size  distribution,  and,
especially,  particle  charge,  are  difficult.  Of  these  three
parameters,  electric  field  measurements  are  the  most
likely to be available.
6. 3.2    Measurements  of  electrostatic  field  can  be  made
with a commonly available electrostatic fieldmeter. The
units  of  electrostatic  field  are  volts/cm  (volts/inch).</p><p>SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 2002 4
Precise  measurements  will  be  difficult  as  the  presence
of    the    measuring    instrument    changes    the    field
characteristics  and  may  overstate  the  actual  level  of
electrostatic field. This is shown in Section 7, Figure 3.
SEMI  E43  describes  measurement  techniques  using  an
electrostatic fieldmeter.
6. 3.3  Electrostatic deposition velocity depends only on
electric    field,    particle    size    and    particle    charge.
However,  the  concentration  of  particles  deposited  on  a
surface also depends on the particle concentration in the
equipment  area  and  the  length  of  the  exposure  time
during  which  particle  deposition  occurs.  Mechanisms
other than electrostatic deposition, such as gravitational
settling  and  diffusion,  can  also  contribute  to  particle
deposition.  The  concentration  of  particles  deposited  by
these  non-electrostatic  mechanisms  will  also  vary  with
particle  concentration  in  the  equipment  ambient  and
exposure time.
6. 3.4        Comparisons    of    the    electrostatic    deposition
velocity  with  the  deposition  velocities  associated  with
these   other   deposition   mechanisms   is   the   key   for
determining  threshold  values  of  allowed  electrostatic
field  from  the  viewpoint  of  particle  deposition.  Such
comparisons  are  the  basis  for  estimating  the  allowed
values  of  electrostatic  field  presented  in  Appendix  A1-
2. 2 and Related Information R1-2. Users and equipment
manufacturers  should  determine  and  agree  on  ambient
particle sizes and concentrations, and product exposure
times.
6. 4  Equipment ESD
6. 4.1    Equipment  ESD  immunity  is  being  addressed  in
general  through  a  number  of  international  standards
including  IEC  61000-4-2  and  BS  EN  61000-6-2  for
European   CE   compliance.   Measurements   are   made
using  an  ESD  simulator  which  is  described  in  these
standards.
6. 4.2  The ESD simulator is used to create both a direct
discharge  to  the  surface  of  the  equipment  and  an  air
discharge  to  a  surface  10  cm  (4  inches)  away  from  the
equipment. The ESD simulator charges a 150 picofarad
capacitor   (C)   to   a   known   voltage   (V)   and   then
discharges   it   to   produce   a   standardized   discharge
waveform.   Knowing   the   voltage   and   capacitance
involved  in  this  test  means  the  total  charge  can  be
calculated by the equation q = CV. For example, a 4000
volt  discharge  (IEC  61000-4-2  test  level)  transfers  a
charge, q = 600 nanocoulombs.
6. 4.3      The   value   of   the   capacitor   (C)   in   the   ESD
simulator  is  specified  in  the  international  standards.  It
should   not   be   assumed   that   a   different   value   of
capacitance  and  voltage  that  produce  the  same  charge
transfer  of  600  nanocoulombs  would  have  the  same
affect  on  a  specific  piece  of  equipment.  Discharge
currents  will  vary  with  the  impedance  of  the  discharge
path and with the voltage. It is, however, impractical to
test  all  possible  combinations.  For  the  purposes  of  this
guide, the parameters of the ESD simulator specified in
the  standards  for  equipment  ESD  immunity  will  be
used.
6. 4.4      For   true   ESD   immunity,   an   ESD   event   in
equipment  must  not  disturb  either  the  equipment  it
occurs in, or another nearby piece of equipment. Charge
on  product  or  carriers  transferred  from  one  piece  of
equipment must not disturb the operation of subsequent
equipment. It will be a systems issue to make sure that
all  equipment  in  a  facility  meets  the  required  ESD
immunity standards.
6. 4.5    The  range  of  reactions  in  equipment  to  an  ESD
event  runs  from  transient  errors  that  are  automatically
corrected,   to   hard   errors   that   cannot   be   corrected
without  manual  intervention  or  damage  the  equipment.
While   small   numbers   of   transient   errors   may   be
acceptable   from   the   point   of   view   of   equipment
operation,  they  may  still  cause  unacceptable  product
losses.
6. 4.6    The  user  and  manufacturer  must  determine  with
an ESD simulator what levels of ESD cause equipment
interruptions.  The  user  must  determine  if  any  of  these
equipment interruptions caused by ESD are acceptable.
6. 4.7      In  setting  a  level  to  provide  ESD  immunity  for
an  individual  piece  of  equipment  from  static  charge  on
products and carriers, the charge on these items should
be  kept  below  the  levels  determined  by  ESD  simulator
testing.
6. 4.8    The  Faraday  Cup  measurement  can  be  used  for
this  purpose.  If  equipment  has  been  tested  for  ESD
immunity and passes a 4000 volt test, then total charge
on  product  and  carriers  leaving  this  equipment  should
be   kept   below   600   nanocoulombs.   Any   product
transferred  at  this  level  should  not  be  handled  by  other
equipment  with  a  lower  ESD  immunity.  A  possible
implementation of this test method is shown in Section
7, Figure 4.
7  Apparatus
7. 1  ESD Damage ó The apparatus for determining the
ESD damage thresholds for products will depend on the
test   methods   used.   See   Section   4   for   additional
information.  For  measuring  the  charge  generated  on
product,   reticles,   or   carriers,   the   Faraday   Cup   test
method is shown in Figure 1.</p><p>SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 2002 5

8. 1  Personnel   ó   Static   charges   can   create   safety
hazards     during     some     semiconductor     production
processes.   ESA   or   ESD   events   that   result   in   the
jamming   or   breakage   of   product   in   high   speed
equipment  may  create  a  personnel  hazard.  ESD  events
that produce sparks must be prevented in areas that use
flammable or explosive chemicals or gases. ESD events
to  personnel  are  usually  not  harmful,  but  they  may
result  in  an  unwanted  reflex,  or  ìstartleî  reaction.  This
reflex may create a personnel hazard, particularly in the
vicinity    of    moving    equipment    or    where    caustic
chemicals   are   in   use.   It   may   be   necessary   to   use
additional  static  charge  control  methods,  beyond  those
used inside the equipment, to minimize these personnel
hazards.
8. 2  Measurement   Safety   ó   Users   should   exercise
caution while making static charge measurements in the
vicinity of moving parts of production equipment, or in
areas where static potentials on ungrounded conductors
may  exceed  30,000  volts.  Refer  to  SEMI  E43  for
additional measurement safety considerations.</p><p>SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 2002 6
9  Test Specimen
9. 1    The  user  and  equipment  manufacturer  will  need  to
agree on:
• The type(s) of testing to be performed,
• Who will do the testing,
• The number and type of test samples,
• The number of measurements, and
• Acceptable test results.
9. 2  The operating history of the equipment prior to, or
during  testing  (e.g.,  warm-up  time,  type  of  carrier,
number of products processed, operating speed), and all
appropriate        environmental        conditions        (e.g.,
temperature,  humidity,  airflow)  should  be  agreed  upon
and documented.
10  Preparation of Apparatus
10. 1    Depending  on  the  type  of  testing  to  be  done,
consult  the  appropriate  testing  document  for  apparatus
preparation.   See   Sections   4   and   16   for   additional
information.
11  Calibration and Standardization
11. 1    Depending  on  the  type  of  testing  to  be  done,
consult  the  appropriate  testing  document  for  apparatus
calibration  and  verification.  See  Sections  4  and  16  for
additional information.
12  Procedures
12. 1  Refer to Sections 6 and 7 and the appropriate test
methods of Sections 4 and 16.
12. 2  ESD Damage
12. 2.1  Users shall establish product damage thresholds
for their products. Measurement methods for integrated
circuits  are  described  in  the  documents  contained  in
Sections  4  and  16.  Appropriate  measurement  methods
for  ESD  damage  to  wafers,  reticles,  and  other  items
may  be  adapted  from  the  instrumentation  used  in  these
test     methods.     Appendix     A1-2.1     and     Related
Information   R1-1   contain   additional   information   to
select  an  appropriate  sensitivity  level  to  reduce  ESD
damage.
12. 2.2    Measurement  of  ESD  damage  thresholds  are
made in units of nanocoulombs (nC = 10
-9
coulombs).
12. 2.3    The  Faraday  Cup  method  is  used  to  determine
the  static  charge  levels  on  products,  product  carriers
and  equipment  parts.  Each  item  shall  be  transported  to
the  Faraday  cup  in  a  way  that  does  not  alter  its  charge
level.      Consult      the      measurement      equipment
manufacturerís  instructions  for  recommendations  on
how to achieve this.
12. 2.4      Measurements   should   be   made   of   products,
carriers, and materials in the equipment input/exit ports
after significant amounts of product have been handled
under  normal  manufacturing  conditions.  Measurements
should be made of products and their carriers after they
have  undergone  normal  processing  in  the  equipment
under  test.  Typically  five  measurements  of  products
and/or   carriers   should   be   sufficient   to   demonstrate
compliance with the selected Sensitivity Level.
12. 2.5  Measurements should be made on each of three
successive  days  after  equipment  has  stabilized  in  its
normal operating mode (e.g., after two hours).
12. 3  Particle Attraction
12. 3.1            Users      should      work      with      equipment
manufacturers  to  determine  ambient  particle  levels  and
product  exposure  times  during  processing.  Appendix
A1-2.2    and    Related    Information    R1-2    contain
information to select an appropriate Sensitivity Level to
reduce electrostatic attraction of particles.
12. 3.2    Electrostatic  field  measurements  on  products,
product  carriers,  and  equipment  surfaces  should  be
made  in  at  least  three  different  locations  on  any  item.
Locations  should  be  separated  by  approximately  three
times  the  distance  between  the  measuring  instrument
and  the  measurement  location.  For  most  electrostatic
fieldmeters   measuring   at   25.4   mm   (1   inch),   the
measurement  locations  will  be  76.2  mm  (3  inches)
apart.  Refer  to  SEMI  E43  for  additional  measurement
considerations.  Measurements  of  electrostatic  field  are
expressed in volts/cm or volts/inch.
12. 3.3      Measurements   should   be   made   on   products,
carriers, and materials in the equipment input/exit ports
after significant amounts of product have been handled
under  normal  manufacturing  conditions.  Measurements
should be made of products and their carriers after they
have  undergone  normal  processing  in  the  equipment
under  test.  Typically  five  measurements  of  products
and/or   carriers   should   be   sufficient   to   demonstrate
compliance with the selected Sensitivity Level.
12. 3.4  Measurements should be made on each of three
successive  days  after  equipment  has  stabilized  in  its
normal operating mode (e.g., after two hours).
12. 4  Equipment ESD
12. 4.1  Equipment  manufacturers  should  determine  the
effects   of   ESD   on   their   equipment   using   an   ESD
Simulator and the appropriate test methods (IEC 6100-
4-2  or  others).  Users  should  agree  on  the  types  of
equipment   interrupts   that   are   acceptable   (if   any).
Appendix A1-2.3 and Related Information R1-3 contain</p><p>SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 2002 7
additional    information    to    select    an    appropriate
sensitivity   level   to   reduce   ESD-related   equipment
interruptions.
12. 4.2    Compliance  with  the  desired  Sensitivity  Level
may  be  demonstrated  using  the  Faraday  Cup  method
described in Sections 6.4 and 7.3.
12. 4.3      Measurements   should   be   made   on   products,
carriers, and materials in the equipment input/exit ports
after significant amounts of product have been handled
under  normal  manufacturing  conditions.  Measurements
should be made of products and their carriers after they
have  undergone  normal  processing  in  the  equipment
under  test.  Typically,  five  measurements  of  products
and/or   carriers   should   be   sufficient   to   demonstrate
compliance with the selected Sensitivity Level.
12. 5    Equipment  used  in  semiconductor  manufacturing
should  meet  the  following  levels  shown  in  Table  1  for
protection from problems caused by static charge.

Level 2 10 200 300
Level 1 1 100 150</p><ol start="12"><li>5.1      Sensitivity   Level   4   compliance   means   that
products, reticles, and carriers can leave the equipment
with  up  to  the  recommended  amounts  of  static  charge
or electrostatic field measured on them according to the
test  method  used.  This  level  essentially  states  that  the
equipment  is  used  in  a  process  that  has  no  significant
problems handling charged product, nor are there issues
associated with contamination or ESD damage.</li><li>5.2  At levels 1, 2, or 3 a decision should be made as
to  what  is  the  most  serious  static  charge  problem.  The
Sensitivity    Level    and    test    methods    are    chosen
accordingly.   The   lower   the   level   of   static   charge
allowed,    the    more    static    control    measures    the
equipment manufacturer may need to install.</li><li>5.3  Level 1 may be used primarily by manufacturers
of  specialized  components  such  as:  gallium  arsenide
semiconductors  or  magneto-resistive  (MR)  disk  drive
read heads; those experiencing significant losses due to
contamination;  or  those  using  specialized  equipment
with low immunity to ESD or EMI.</li><li>6  The levels listed in Table 1 have been determined
as  the  result  of  analysis  of  working  conditions,  or
experiments done in operating semiconductor facilities.
Justifications  for  these  levels  are  found  in  Appendix  1.
The actual levels to be used for any piece of production
equipment  may  be  decided  by  agreement  between  the
user and manufacturer of the equipment.</li><li>7    Other  levels  may  be  appropriate  under  specific
equipment conditions and for specific devices.
13  Calculations</li><li>1    A  series  of  five  measurements  should  be  made.
The   average   of   the   five   measurements   should   not
exceed the recommended level.
14  Reporting Results</li><li>1        Data    records    should    contain    the    following
information:
• Description   of   equipment   under   test   including
model and serial numbers.
• Description  of  the  equipment  operating  conditions
and environment.
• Measurement equipment and last calibration date.
• Description  of  objects  measured  and  measurement
locations.
• Humidity and temperature at measurement location
when measurements were made.
• Results of measurements.
• Personnel making the measurements.
• Any other relevant comments.
15  Precision and Accuracy</li><li>1  Accuracy  of  Test  Methods  ó  The  test  methods
referenced  in  this  document  do  not  guarantee  precise
measurements    of    static    charge    levels.    Similarly,
maximum  static  charge  levels  recommended  in  this
document   are   not   stated   as   precise   requirements.
Accuracy  of  approximately  ±  20%  is  acceptable  in  all
measuring  instrumentation.  At  low  static  charge  levels
or    for    more    accurate    measurements,    alternative
instrumentation and test methods may need to be used.
