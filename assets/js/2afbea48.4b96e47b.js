Use  an\nRF termination sized appropriately for the RF generator\nunder  test.  Finally,  use  an  RF  termination  capable  of\ndissipating  DC  energy,  without  damage  due  to  the\neffects   of   electrolysis. The   return   loss   of   the   RF\ntermination,    including    the    interconnecting    cable\nbetween  the  RF  generator  and  the  termination  shall  be\nno  less  than  30  dB.

These  instruments  shall  have  a  certificate\nindicating NIST traceability.  Choose meters capable of\nvoltage  and  current  measurement  accuracy  of  less  than\n0. 2%.\n6. 4  Calibration Power Supply \u2014 This power supply is\nused as a source of clean DC energy for the purposes of\ncalibrating  the  calorimetric  power  meter.    Use  a  power\nsupply sized for the calibration to be performed and that\nprovides a very stable output at all levels.\n6. 5  Cables and Connectors \u2014 Various interconnecting\ncables  are  required  to  perform  the  tests outlined  in  this\ntest  method.    These  include  low-loss  cables  to  connect\nthe  DC  power  source  to  the  measuring  instrument  and\nto  the  RF  load,  in  addition  to  low-loss  RF  cables  and\nconnectors  to  connect  the  RF  generator  output  to  the\nload.\n6. 5.1  In  order  to  keep  cable  losses  to  a  minimum,\nminimize the lengths of interconnecting cables.\n6. 5.2  In  addition,  compensate  for  the  losses  associated\nwith interconnecting cables used.\nNOTE 2:  For  example,  if  6  m  (20  feet)  of  #10  AWG  copper\nwire is used to connect the DC supply to the calorimeter, this\nwire will add approximately 0.04 \u2126 of resistance between the\nDC  source  and  the  50  \u2126  termination.  Using  a  DC  supply\nvoltage  of  500  V  terminated  by  50  \u2126  (i.e.,  5  kW),  this  will\nresult in a loss of about 4 W in the copper wire.\n6. 5.3  Adjust  the  reading  obtained  by  the  calorimeter\naccording to the cable loss value.\nNOTE 3:  For   example,   suppose   that   an   RF   generator,\noperating at 13.56 MHz and developing 3 kW is connected to\nthe  calorimeter  through  a  6  m  (20-foot)  length  of  RG-217/U\ncoaxial    cable.        RG-217/U    coaxial    cable    has    a    loss\nspecification of 0.41 dB per 30 m (100 feet) of cable at 13.56\nMHz.  Therefore, for 6 m (20 feet) of cable, the loss would be\napproximately  0.41/5,  or  0.082  dB.    If  the  RF  generator  is\ndeveloping  3  kW,  this  means  that  approximately  2.944  kW\nwould appear at the calorimeter due to the cable loss.\n7  Safety Precautions\nNOTE 4:  The  tests  described  in  this  test  method  involve\nusing  low-output  power  test  instrumentation  (typically  less\nthan 10 mW).\n7. 1  Work  should  be  conducted  in  accordance  with\nlocal      safety      requirements      and      test      device\nmanufacturer\u2019s recommended safety procedures.\n7. 2  The  area  immediately  surrounding  the  test  setup\nshould be kept free and clear of unnecessary equipment\nand materials.\n7. 3  Testing    personnel    should    ensure    they    have"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E136-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2004 3\nadequate  lifting  devices  for  large  weights  such  as  long\nRF cables and generators themselves.\n7. 4  Persons  performing  tests  should  determine  which\nmethod  of  water  cooling  of  the  resistor  in  the  RF\ntermination  is  utilized  by  the  test  device  manufacturer\nand should take steps to ensure safe use of the device.\n7. 4.1  Cooling-water flow rates should be appropriate to\nthe  test  device  manufacturer\u2019s  recommendations  for\ncooling  of  the  power  load  level  being  tested.    Consult\nthe  RF  generator  operating  manual  load  specifications\nfor this information.\n7. 4.2  An RF termination using internal resistor cooling\nonly  is  highly  recommended  because  such  resistors  (of\nthe  tubular  ceramic,  thin  film  type)  are  usually  cooled\nby routing the coolant to the inside of the ceramic tube\nand  away  from  the  resistive  film,  thereby  eliminating\nthe  possibility  of  electrolysis  affecting  the  resistive\nfilm.\n7. 4.3  In an alternative method, the coolant is routed on\nboth  the  inside  and  the  outside  of  the  resistor.    While\nthis  method  provides  for  more  efficient  cooling,  the\nproximity   of   the   coolant   to   the   resistive   film   can\npotentially result in damage to the resistive film caused\nby  electrolysis  generated  by  the  DC  energy  passing\nthrough the fluid in the termination.\n7. 4.3.1  For this reason, if an RF termination using both\ninternal  and  external  cooling  is  used,  it  is  important  to\nperiodically   check   the   resistor for   damage   due   to\nelectrolysis.  This can be done easily by measuring the\nresistance  of  the  load  resistor  using  a  simple  digital\nmultimeter.\n7. 4.3.2  With the RF termination disconnected from the\nRF  cable,  place  one  probe  on  the  center  conductor  of\nthe    termination,    and    the    other    probe    on    the\ntermination\u2019s outer conductor.\n7. 4.3.3  Measure  the  DC  resistance  of  this  path.    If the\nDC resistance is more than 53 \u2126, replace the resistor in\nthe termination.\n7. 5  In  order  to  prevent  the  possibility  of  ground  loops\nbetween  the  RF  generator  and  the  calorimeter  system,\nbe sure to operate the calorimeter and the RF generator\non the same AC supply.\n8  Test Setup for RF Generator Power Output\nTest\n8. 1  The  test  setup  for  the  RF  generator  output  power\ntest  consists  of  the  RF  generator  connected  to  the\ncalorimeter  power  meter  through  a  length  of  coaxial\ncable.\n8. 2  Prior  to  making  any  measurements,  calibrate  the\ncalorimeter  power  meter  using  a  source  of  stable  DC\nenergy.\n9  Test Procedure for Determining RF\nGenerator Output Power\n9. 1  Calorimetric    power    meters    provide    excellent\nreference  standards  for  the  measurement  of  RF  energy\nin  that  they  are  capable  of  measuring  the  true  heating\npower  of  a  waveform,  including  any  harmonic-  or\nnonharmonic-related     frequency     components.     The\ntechnique  employed  for  this  test  is  to  first  calibrate  the\ncalorimetric  power  meter  with  DC  energy,  which  can\nbe  very  precisely  determined.

This input\ndata is listed in Table 1.  When studying this example, the user should remember that parameter values are for the\ngas delivery system only, not the entire process piece of equipment.\nR1-2  Sample Model Output\nR1-2.1  The model calculates each term in the numerator of Equation 2 and then sums these results and divides by\nthe denominator to get COO.  To enhance the user\u2019s understanding of the components of COO, Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5\nand  the  spreadsheet  show  interim  results.    For  the  set  of  inputs  listed  in  Table  1,  F$  are  shown  in  Table  2,  R$  are\nshown  in  Table  3,  and  Y$  are  shown  in  Table  4.    Each  of  these  terms  is  calculated  from  the  cost  factors  listed  in\nSEMI E35.  The italicized rows in Tables 2, 3, and 4 correspond to these cost factors and show the subtotal for that\ncost factor.  The breakdown for each cost factor is shown in the rows below it.\nR1-2.2  Tables 2, 3, and 4 show costs for years 1 through 7.  The last year is based on user input.  It is the longest of\nuseful life or depreciable life.  In the example shown, depreciable life was set to 7 years and useful life was set to 5\nyears.    The  depreciable  life  was  deliberately  made  longer  than  the  useful  life  to  illustrate  the  feature  of  the\nspreadsheet  that  allows  these  two  parameter  values  to  differ.

No  restrictions  are  implied  for  any  interface\nother than for equipment covered by this standard.\n3. 2  Electrical Interface \u2014 The co nnection will include\na  serial  interface  according  to  EIA  Standard  RS-232-C\nfor   interface   Type   E,   full   duplex   communication,\nmodified  by  the  deletions,  additions  and  exceptions\ndescribed in this section.\n3. 2.1    Connector   \u2014   Either   the   9-pin    or   25-pin\nconnector described in the EIA RS232  may be used. In\nthe case of the 25-pin connector a female connector will\nbe mounted on the equipment and a male connector will\nbe  mounted  on  the  cable  from  the  host.

Since  any  method  may  be  used  in  SECS-I  as\nlong as RS-232-C signals are supplied at the connector,\nthe distance and isolation is dependent upon the design\nof the physical medium which is external to the SECS-I\nstandard. (See Related Information R1-2.)\n4  Character Structure\n4. 1  Characters \u2014 Data will be tra nsmitted or received\nin  a  serial  bit  stream  of  10  bits  per  character  at  one  of\nthe specified data rates. The standard character has one\nstart  bit  (0),  8  data  bits  and  one  stop  bit  (1).  All  bit\ntransmissions are of the same duration. The 8 data bits\nare numbered from 1 to 8 in the order sent (see Figure\n1). The timing between characters is asynchronous with\nrespect  to  the  data  rate.  The  8  data  bits  may  be  any\narbitrary  code.  The  eight  data  bits  will  hereafter  be\nreferred to as a byte.\nFigure 1\nCharacter Structure\n4. 2   Weighted  Codes  \u2014  For  bytes  h aving  weighted\ncodes, bit one is the least significant and bit eight is the\nmost  significant.  The  most  common  weighted  code  is\nbinary.\n4. 3    Non-Weighted   Codes   \u2014   For   c odes   without\nnumeric  value  such  as  ASCII,  the  bit  numbers  will  be\nused   as   the   entry   into   a   standard   code   table   for\ninterpretation of the code. SECS-I performs no parity or\nother verification of the contents of individual bytes.\n5  Block Transfer Protocol\n5. 1   The  procedure  used  by  the  seri al  line  to  establish\nthe   direction   of   communication   and   provide   the\nenvironment  for  passing  message  blocks  is  called  the\nblock   transfer   protocol.   Most   of   the   protocol   is\naccomplished  with  a  handshake  of  single  bytes.  When\nboth  ends  of  the  line  try  to  send  at  the  same  time,  a\ncondition known as line contention exists. The protocol\nresolves  contention  by  forcing  one  end  of  the  line,\ndesignated  as  the  slave  (always  the  host),  to  postpone\nits    transmission    and    enter    the    receive    mode.\nRetransmission     of     blocks     is     used     to     correct\ncommunication  errors.  The  block  transfer  protocol  is\nshown  in  flow  chart  form  in  Figure  2,  and  described\nbelow.   Additional   information   is   also   contained   in\nRelated Information R1-3 and R1-4.\n5. 2  Handshake Bytes  \u2014  The  four   standard  handshake\ncodes  used  in  the  block  transfer  protocol  are  shown  in\nTable 2. The three letter names, ENQ, EOT, ACK, and\nNAK  correspond  to  the  ASCII  code  having  the  same\npattern.\nTable 2  Handshake Codes\nNameCodeb8\nb7.........b1\nFunction\nENQ00000101Request to Send\nEOT00000100Ready to Receive\nACK00000110Correct Reception\nNAK00010101Incorrect Reception\n5. 3   Timeout  Parameters  \u2014  Timeo uts  are  used  to  de-\ntect  communications  failures.  A  timeout  occurs  when\nthe  measured  time  between  two  events  exceeds  a  pre-\ndetermined  limit.  Generally,  the  length  of  time  that\nmust pass before it can be assumed that an error has oc-\ncurred  depends  upon  the  particular  systems  involved.\nThe time required in one situation might be excessively\nlong  in  another.  Thus,  the  timeout  values  must  be\n"tuned"  to  meet  the  application.  In  the  block  transfer\nprotocol, there are two situations requiring timeout val-\nues.  The  two  timeout  values  are  called  parameters  T1\nand T2.\n5. 3.1    Inter-Character   Timeout,   T1   \u2014    The   inter-\ncharacter timeout, T1, limits the time between receipt of\ncharacters within a block after the length byte has been\nreceived  and  until  the  receipt  of  the  second  checksum\nbyte.\n5. 3.2   Protocol  Timeout,  T2  \u2014  The  p rotocol  timeout,\nT2, limits the time between sending ENQ and receiving\nEOT,  sending  EOT  and  receiving  the  length  byte,  and\nsending  the  second  checksum  byte  and  receiving  any\ncharacter.'),(0,i.yg)("p",null,'SEMI E4-0699 \xa9 SEMI 1980, 19995\n5. 4   Retry  Limit,  RTY  \u2014  The  retry   limit,  RTY,  is  the\nmaximum number of times the Block Transfer Protocol\nwill attempt to retry sending a block before declaring a\nfailed send. (See Section 5.8.2.)\n5. 5   Master/Slave  \u2014  The  master/sl ave  parameter  is\nused in the resolution of contention (see Section 5.8.2).\nThe  host  is  designated  as  the  slave.  The  equipment  is\ndesig-nated  as  the  master.  This  convention  is  based\nupon  the  assumption  that  the  equipment  is  less  able  to\nstore messages than the host.\n5. 6   Block  Lengths  \u2014  The  unsigne d  integer  value  of\nthe  first  byte  sent  after  receipt  of  EOT  is  the  length  of\nthe  block  being  sent.  The  length  includes  all  the  bytes\nsent  after  the  length  byte,  excluding  the  2  bytes  of  the\nchecksum.   The   maximum   block   length   allowed   by\nSECS-I is 254 bytes, and the minimum is 10 bytes.\n5. 7   Checksum  \u2014  The  checksum  is   calculated  as  the\nnumeric  sum  of  the  unsigned  binary  values  of  all  the\nbytes after the length byte and before the checksum in a\nsingle  block.  The  checksum  is  sent  as  16  bits  in  two\nbytes following the last byte of the block data. The high\norder  eight  bits  of  the  checksum  will  be  sent  first,\nfollowed  by  the  low  order  eight  bits.  The  checksum  is\nused  by  the  receiver  to  check  for  transmission  errors.\nThe  receiver  performs  the  same  checksum  calculation\non the received header and data.\n5. 8   Algorithm  \u2014  The  operation  of   the  block  transfer\nprotocol is best understood by following the logic flow\nin Figure 2. This flow chart depicts the operation of the\nfive  states  of  the  protocol  -  Receive,  Idle,  Send  Line\nControl, and Completion. The flow chart shown in Fig-\nure 2 is not meant to imply that a particular implemen-\ntation  is  required  under  this  standard.  However,  any\nSECS-I block transfer protocol implementation must in-\nclude  all  the  logic  described  in  Figure  2.  The  same\nalgorithm  is  executed  on  each  end  of  the  SECS-I\ncommunications link.\n5. 8.1   Idle  State  \u2014  Both  ends  of  the   communications\nlink are assumed to start in the Idle state. There are two\nprimary  activities  of  the  protocol  signified  by  the  two\nexits from the Idle state. These are:\nA.   SEND \u2014 a message block is to be sent.\nB.    RECEIVE \u2014 the other end of the communications\nlink has a message block to send\n5. 8.2   Line  Control  \u2014  The  line  contr ol  section  estab-\nlishes  the  transmission  direction,  resolves  contention,\nand  handles  retries.  When  an  ENQ  is  received  in  the\nIdle state, the Line Control responds with an EOT if the\nBlock Transfer Protocol is ready to receive. The Block\nTransfer  Protocol  then  goes  to  the  Receive  state.  If  a\nmessage block is to be sent, then an ENQ is sent. If an\nEOT is received in response to the ENQ within the time\nlimit  T2,  the  Block  Transfer  Protocol  goes  to  the  Send\nstate.\n5. 8.2.1  If the slave receives an ENQ in  response to the\nENQ, contention has occurred. The slave postpones the\nsend  of  its  block  until  it  receives  a  block  from  the\nmaster.  The  slave  prepares  to  receive  the  incoming\nblock  and  sends  an  EOT.  When  the  block  transfer\nprotocol  returns  to  the  Idle  state,  the  postponed  block\nSend may be sent as if it were a new send request. After\na  master  sends  an  ENQ,  it  can  ignore  all  characters\nexcept  an  EOT.  After  a  slave  sends  at  ENQ,  it  can\nignore all characters except an ENQ or EOT.\n5. 8.2.2   When  the  time  between  sendin g  ENQ  and\nreceiving EOT exceeds T2, or the time between sending\nthe  second  checksum  byte  and  receiving  any  character\nexceeds T2, or a non-ACK character is received within\ntime  T2  after  sending  the  second  checksum  byte,  the\nLine  Control  will  increment  the  retry  count  ("tries"  in\nthe  flowchart).  If  the  retry  count  does  not  exceed  the\nvalue  of  the  RTY  parameter,  then  the  Block  Transfer\nProtocol  will  retry  sending  the  block  beginning  with\nENQ.  If  the  retry  count  does  exceed  the  value  of  the\nRTY parameter, then a failed send has occurred.\n5. 8.3  Send \u2014 Once a send state is es tablished, the first\nbyte sent is the length, N, of the data in the block. After\nN  more  bytes  have  been  sent,  the  two  bytes  of  the\nchecksum are sent. The sender computes the checksum\nbased on the data in the block and the block header, but\nnot the length byte. When the sender receives the ACK\nbefore  time  T2,  the  block  is  deemed  properly  sent.\nHowever,  if  the  sender  receives  a  non-ACK  character\nbefore  time  T2,  or  no  character  within  time  T2,  it\nreturns  to  the  line  control  state  for  a  possible  retry.  In\nthe  Send  state,  characters  received  prior  to  sending  the\nlast checksum byte can be ignored.\n5. 8.4   Receive  \u2014  Once  a  receive  stat e  is  established,\nthe   first   byte   received   is   the   length   byte,   N.   The\nreceiver  counts  and  saves  the  following  N  +  2  bytes.\nThe  last  two  bytes  are  the  checksum.  The  receiver\ncompares  the  two  checksum  bytes  against  its  own\ncomputation  of  the  checksum.  In  a  good  block,  the\ncomputed and received checksum are the same.\n5. 8.5  Receive Completion \u2014 After a  block is correctly\nreceived,  an  ACK  character  is  sent  and  the  message\nprotocol is notified that a block has been received. If T2\nis exceeded while waiting for the length character, or Tl\nis exceeded between characters being received, then an\nNAK  is  sent.  If  the  length  byte  is  invalid  or  if  the  re-\nceived  checksum  does  not  agree  with  the  computed\nchecksum, the receiver continues to listen for characters\nto  ensure  that  the  sender  is  finished  sending.  This  is\ndetected  when  the  inter-character  time  exceeds  T1,  at\nwhich point the receive is aborted and a NAK is sent. In'),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E4-0699 \xa9 SEMI 1980, 19996\nany  case  when  an  NAK  is  sent,  the  receiver  may  dis-\ncard any data it has received for the block. The receiver\nreturns  immediately  to  the  Idle  state  after  sending  an\nACK or NAK.\n5. 8.6  Send Completion  \u2014  After  the   second  checksum\nbyte is sent, if an ACK is received within time T2, the\nmessage protocol is notified that the send was success-\nful.  If  a  failed  send  occurs,  the  message  protocol  is  in-\nformed  of  the  failure.  Application-level  software  must\ntake the possibility of a send failure into account.\nFigure 2\nBlock Transfer Protocol"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E4-0699 \xa9 SEMI 1980, 19997\n6  Header Structure\n6. 1   The  operation  of  all  communic ations  functions\nabove    the    block    transfer    protocol    is    linked    to\ninformation  contained  in  a  10-byte  data  element  called\nthe  header.  The  header  is  always  the  first  10  bytes  of\nevery  block  sent  by  the  block  transfer  protocol.  The\ninformation  in  the  header  is  also  used  by  the  message\nprotocol (see Section 7). The fixed format of the header\nis described in this section.

The R-bit is set to 0\nfor messages to the equipment and set to 1 for messages\nto  the  host.

Device identification is a\nproperty   of   the   equipment   and   must   be   settable\naccording to Section 8. The host can view the device ID\nas a logical identifier connected with a physical device\nwithin the equipment. The host has no device ID.\n6. 4  Wait Bit (W-Bit) \u2014 The wait b it (W-bit) is used to\nindicate that the sender of a primary message expects a\nreply. A value of one in the W-bit means that a reply is\nexpected.  A  value  of  zero  in  the  W-bit  means  that  no\nreply  is  expected.  The  W-bit  must  be  set  to  zero  in  all\nsecondary   messages.   For   multi-block   messages,   the\nsender  must  ensure  that  the  W-bit  is  the  same  in  every\nblock of the message.\n6. 5   Message  ID  \u2014  The  message  I D  identifies  the\nformat  and  content  of  the  message  being  sent  (the\nparticular  message  is  one  of  many  possible  for  the\ndevice   in   question).

An   odd\nnumbered message will have bit 1 of the lower message\nID set to 1.\n6. 5.2   Secondary  Message  \u2014  A  seco ndary  message  is\ndefined  as  any  even  numbered  message.

See SECS-II for more information.\n6. 6   End  Bit  (E-Bit)  \u2014  The  end  bit   (E-bit)  is  used  to\ndetermine  if  a  block  is  the  last  block  of  a  message.  A\nvalue of one in the E-bit means that the block is the last\nblock.  A  value  of  zero  means  that  more  blocks  are  to\nfollow.\n6. 7   Block  Number  \u2014  A  message  s ent  as  more  than\none  block  is  called  a  multi-block  message.  The  first\nblock  is  given  a  block  number  of  one,  and  the  block\nnumber  is  incremented  by  one  for  each  subsequent\nblock  until  the  entire  message  is  sent.  The  blocks  of  a\nmulti-block message are sent in order. In a single-block\nmessage, the block number must have a value of zero or\none. The maximum block number is 32,767.

The  message  protocol  uses  the  services\nof  the  block  transfer  protocol  to  send  and  receive\nmessages.  The  message  consists  of  the  message  data\ntogether with the following information from the header\n\u2014  R-bit,  device  ID,  W-bit,  message  ID,  and  system\nbytes.\n7. 2   Message  Send  \u2014  When  a  mes sage  is  ready  to  be\nsent,  the  message  send  protocol  performs  the  functions\ndescribed  below.  A  block  send  failure  terminates  the\nmessage protocol action on that message.\n7. 2.1  Message Length \u2014 The maxim um data length in\na single block of a message is 244 bytes. The maximum\nnumber  of  blocks  that  can  be  sent  in  a  multi-block\nmessage  is  32,767,  and  so  the  maximum  data  length\nallowed in one message is 244 \xd7  32,767 bytes.\n7. 2.2   Message  Blocking  \u2014  Message   blocking  is  the\ndivision  of  the  message  data  into  blocks  to  be  sent  to\nthe Block Transfer Protocol. For best performance, it is\nrecommended,  but  not  required,  that  the  sender  fill  all\nblocks  of  a  multi-block  message,  except  possibly  the\nlast  block,  with  the  maximum  254  bytes.  The  receiver\nof  a  multi-block  message  should  be  able  to  accept  any\nblock size from 11 to 254 bytes, and should not require\nconsecutive blocks necessarily to be the same size.\n7. 2.2.1   Certain  older  implementations   may  impose\napplication-specific  requirements  on  block  sizes  for\ncertain  incoming  messages.  Beginning  with  the  1988\nrevision  of  the  standard,  new  applications  may  not\nimpose  application-specific  requirements  on  incoming\nblock   sizes.   Applications   implemented   before   1988\nmay impose such requirements.\nNOTE:  In  SECS-II,  certain  messages  are  defined  as  single-\nblock messages and must be sent as a single block in SECS-I.\n7. 2.3  Header  \u2014  The  message  proto col  must  establish\nthe  header  in  each  block  of  the  message  according  to\nthe requirements of Section 6.\n7. 2.4   Interleaving  Messages  \u2014  This   standard  allows,\nbut  does  not  require,  the  support  of  more  than  one\nconcurrent  open  transaction.  This  standard  allows,  but\ndoes  not  require,  the  support  of  interleaving  the  blocks\nof  different  multi-block  messages.  (See  documentation\nrequirements in 9.)\n7. 3    Transactions   \u2014   A   transaction    is   a   primary\nmessage   and   an   optional   corresponding   secondary\nmessage  is  called  the  reply.  A  transaction  is  opened\nwhen   a   primary   message   is   ready   to   be   sent.   A\ntransaction  is  closed  when  the  last  block  of  a  primary\nmessage requesting no reply has been sent, or when the\nlast block of the reply has been received.\n7. 3.1  Reply Linking \u2014 When a reply  is expected for a\nprimary  message,  the  message  protocol  starts  the  reply\ntimer  for  the  transaction  after  the  last  block  of  the\nmessage  is  successfully  sent.  When  a  primary  message\nis sent for which a reply is requested, an expected block\nis  established  for  the  message  receive  algorithm.  (See\nSection   7.4.)   The   expected   block   will   have   the\ncomplement of the R-bit, will have the same device ID,\nwill be the first block of a secondary message, and will\nhave  the  same  system  bytes  as  those  of  the  given\nprimary message.\nNOTE:  In  SECS-II,  the  reply  will  have  the  same  upper\nmessage  ID  (stream),  and  the  lower  message  ID  (function)\nwill  either  be  one  greater  than  that  of  the  corresponding\nprimary message, or it will be zero.\n7. 3.2  Reply Timeout, T3 \u2014 The repl y timeout, T3, is a\nlimit  on  the  length  of  time  that  the  message  protocol  is\nwilling to wait after the last block of a primary message\nhas been sent and before the arrival of the first block of\nthe  reply.  If  the  first  block  of  the  reply  does  not  arrive\nwithin the T3 limit, the expected block is removed from\nthe   list   of   expected   blocks,   and   the   transaction   is\naborted.  A  timer,  called  the  reply  timer,  is  used  to\nmeasure the time between the last block of the primary\nmessage  and  the  first  block  of  its  reply.  Each  open\ntransaction  for  which  a  reply  is  expected  requires  a\nseparate reply timer.\n7. 4    Message   Receive   \u2014   Each   bloc k   successfully\nreceived by the block transfer protocol is passed to the\nmessage protocol. It is the task of the message protocol\nto identify the blocks and assemble them into the proper\nmessage.\n7. 4.1   Routing  Error  \u2014  When  a  piec e  of  equipment\nreceives  a  block  of  data  which  has  a  device  ID  in  the\nblock  header  which  does  not  match  its  own  device  ID\nand it has no other knowledge of this device ID, it can\nassume that the block was sent in error."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E4-0699 \xa9 SEMI 1980, 19999\n7. 4.2  Duplicate Block Detection  \u2014   A  duplicate  block\nis  a  block  which  is  exactly  the  same  as  the  previous\nblock  received  by  the  Block  Transfer  Protocol.  This\nmay occur when the receiver has sent an ACK but, for\nsome  reason,  the  ACK  did  not  arrive  in  time  at  the\nsender,  causing  a  send  retry.  A  duplicate  block  is\ndetected by the SECS-I message protocol by comparing\nthe full 10-byte header of a block currently received by\nthe  block  transfer  protocol  with  the  header  of  the  last\nblock   accepted   as   non-duplicate   by   the   message\nprotocol. If the headers are identical, the new block is a\nduplicate  and  should  be  discarded.  If  the  headers  are\ndifferent, the new block is a non-duplicate. The header\nof  the  non-duplicate  block  saved  for  comparison  with\nthe next block passed on by the block transfer protocol,\nand the block containing the header is further processed\nby the message receive algorithm.\nNOTE: Some implementations which follow the 1980 version\nof  SECS-I  may  not  provide  the  unique  headers  required  for\nduplicate   block   detection.   An   option   for   disabling   the\nduplicate  block  detection  is  required  to  be  compatible  with\nthese systems.\n7. 4.3   Inter-Block  Timeout  T4  \u2014  The   time  interval\nbetween   the   successful   receipt   of   a   block   in   a\nmultiblock  message,  and  the  successful  receipt  of  the\nsubsequent  block  of  the  same  message,  is  limited  to\ntime   T4.   If   this   time   is   exceeded,   the   message   is\ncancelled  and  the  transaction  is  aborted.  A  time  called\nthe   inter-block   timer   is   used   to   measure   the   time\nbetween  block  arrivals  in  the  message  protocol.  There\nmust be one inter-block timer for each open multi-block\nmessage  currently  being  received  by  the  protocol.  As\neach  successive  block  of  a  message  is  received,  the\ncorresponding inter-block timer is reset.\n7. 4.4    Algorithm   \u2014   When   a   block   ar rives   at   the\nmessage protocol, a combination of all the bytes in the\nheader  is  used  to  determine  what  to  do  with  the  block.\nThe operation of the message receive algorithm is to be\nunderstood by following the logic flow in Figure 4. The\nflow chart shown in Figure 4 and the description of the\nalgorithm  below  are  not  meant  to  imply  that  particular\nimplementation    is    required    under    this    standard.\nHowever,       any       SECS-I       message       protocol\nimplementation  must  include  all  the  logic  shown  in\nFigure 4 on page 11.\n7. 4.4.1   The  description  of  the  message   protocol  uses\nthe  concepts  of  an  expected  block.  When  a  (properly\nrouted  and  non-duplicate)  block  is  received  by  the\nmessage protocol, the first determination is whether the\nblock  is  one  of  the  expected  blocks  or  not.  In  order  to\ndetermine  if  a  block  is  one  of  the  expected  blocks,  the\nheader   information   is   compared   with   the   header\ninformation in a list of expected blocks.\n7. 4.4.2   If  the  block  is  not  one  of  the  ex pected  blocks,\nit   must   be   the   first   block   of   a   primary   message,\notherwise  the  block  has  been  sent  in  error  and  can  be\ndiscarded.  If  the  block  is  the  first  block  of  a  primary\nmessage, and it is not the last block of the message (E-\nbit  =  0),  an  inter-block  timer  for  the  given  message  is\nestablished  and  set,  and  the  expected  block  for  the\ngiven message is set to have the same R-bit, device ID,\nsystem  bytes,  W-bit,  message  ID,  and  a  block  number\none greater than that of the block just received.\n7. 4.4.3  If the block is one of the expec ted blocks, then\nit is either the first block of a reply message or it is part\nof an open message.\n7. 4.4.4   If  the  block  is  the  first  block  o f  a  reply\nmessage,  the  reply  timer  for  the  given  message  is\ncancelled.  For  the  first  block  of  a  reply  message,  the\nexpected block will have block number one (or possibly\nzero if the reply is a single block message) and will be a\nsecondary   message,   but   the   full   message   ID   is\nundetermined. (See Section 7.3.1.)\n7. 4.4.5   If  the  block  is  the  last  block  of   the  given\nmessage  (E-bit  =  1),  the  message  is  complete.  If  the\nmessage  is  a  primary  message  for  which  a  reply  is\nrequested  (W-bit  =  1),  the  system  bytes  are  saved  for\nsending with the reply message. (See Section 7.2.3.)\n7. 4.4.6  If the block is not the last bloc k of the message\n(E-bit  =  0),  then  the  inter-block  timer  for  the  given\nmessage  is  reset,  and  the  (next)  expected  block  for  the\ngiven message is set to have the same R-bit, device ID,\nsystem  bytes,  W-bit,  message  ID,  and  a  block  number\none greater than that of the block just received.\n8  Parameter Setting\n8. 1  The eight protocol parameters  are listed in Table 4.\nThe  selection  of  baud  rate  should  be  based  on  system\nperformance. The value of the device ID is determined\nby  the  particular  system  requirements  and  is  generally\nunique  within  one  factory.  The  values  of  the  next  five\nparameters    are    determined    by    the    performance\ncharacteristics  of  the  host  system  and  the  baud  rate  of\nthe communication channel. The first seven parameters\nmust be adjustable by the user. All parameters must be\nstored in such a manner that the settings will be retained\nif  the  power  fails  or  if  the  system  software  is  reloaded.\nThe  range  and  resolution  of  protocol  parameters  must\nbe  at  least  as  shown  in  Table  4.
