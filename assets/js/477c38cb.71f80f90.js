The majorconstraints are the inclusion of only Equipment Yieldand the exclusion of the Cost of Yield Loss consistingof defect limited yield and parametric yield.1.2 The guide establishes well-defined practice tofacilitate cost comparisons of equipment by usingdefinitions, classifications and methods necessary tobuild a useful cost of equipment ownership comparatoras a constraint version of SEMI E35. The guide shouldfacilitate communication about cost of ownership. 2 Scope2.1 This guide is a subset of a full COO calculator aspresented in SEMI E35 and constitutes a fullyconforming standard constraint version. The baselinemetric is meant to reflect those equipment aspects overwhich an equipment supplier has responsibility andseeks to minimize aspects which couple costs forindividual equipment to the entire factory system. Theuse of the metric is for competitive evaluation ofequipment sets to be used for a specific process step.2.2 Effective use of the metric to build a COO modelrequires identification of the constraints, parametervalues within the adopted category classification. Theprimary calculators should, where possible, use directvalues for inputs rather than deriving them fromsecondary models or using the default values providedin Related Information 1 and 2 in SEMI E35. A COOmodel requires data for many parameters. Default datafor the COO is provided within this document and maybe updated periodically through support documents. 3 Referenced Documents3.1 SEMI DocumentsSEMI E10  Guideline for Definition andMeasurement of Equipment Reliability, Availability,and MaintainabilitySEMI E35  Guideline for Cost of Ownership forSemiconductor Manufacturing Equipment Metrics SEMI Compilation of Terms 4 TerminologyAll terminology in this guideline is defined in SEMIE35. 5 Cost of Equipment Ownership ComparatorThe Cost of Equipment Ownership Comparator(CEOC) metric is the incremental cost added to a goodwafer or IC device flowing through a volume sizedprocess system embedded in a factory environment fora specified lifetime. The metric is expressed as Cost perGood Wafer Equivalent for one pass through thesystem. CEOC should reflect the full cost of embeddingand operating in a factory environment a processsystem needed to accommodate a specified number ofwafers but does not include defect yield or parametricyield loss. 5.1 CEOC: Fixed and Recurring Costs  Determiningthe Cost of Ownership requires enumerating all of theFixed and Recurring costs. Fixed costs are thoseincurred once and are usually associated with theacquisition and incorporation of equipment into thefactory. Recurring costs are those which arise on anannual basis from the operation and maintenance of theequipment.5.2 Yield5.2.1 Production yield (PY) is often tied to a largenumber of factors which are principally theresponsibility of the IC manufacturer and equipmentcomparisons for production yield should be donedirectly in the context of the production flow. Yield is ametric of the percentage of the wafer volume thatresults in good wafers and enters the picture in anumber of ways which can complicate comparisons.Yield-related comparisons of equipment should be dealtwith directly rather than lumping them into the CEO.COST ofEmbedding + Operating CEO =annualizedFixed Costsper systemannualizedRecurring Costsper system+( ) ","*","Volume Required# SystemsGood UnitsPer Year 5.2.2 Particles additions for example are often used asa predictor of yield loss.

Tax Life iscustomarily used in COO based upon standardaccounting practice.COO Lifetimes1. Tax Lifetime - Depreciation2. Equipment Production Lifetime5.4 System Throughput  Wafers per hour capabilityfor the process system.5.5 Volume Requirement5.5.1 The volume requirement is the wafer or IC (unit)flow to be processed. The volume requirement can bederived from specification of the product wafers or ICdevices needed corrected for yield and the requirednumber of other wafers which might be designated astest, dummy, or monitor wafers. One complication inaccurately dealing with the volume requirement is thatthe volume of wafers actually reaching the equipmentwill depend on the volume loss from equipment yieldfor all the prior steps.5.5.2 For CEOC, volume should be dealt withparametrically based upon factory wafer starts. Formulti-chamber equipment, the impact of addedchambers to increase capacity should be included aswell as the impact of adding whole systems.5.6 Good Wafer Equivalents (GWE)  GWE isderived from the number of good product die at waferprobe and is expressed as completely good wafers.5.7 Systems Required  See SEMI E35. 6 Reporting ResultsConform to SEMI E35.7 Limitations7.1 Certain factors are more difficult than others toaccurately determine. Thus, the accuracy of a COOcalculation may be prone to a variety of errors oromissions. In addition, line balance considerations arenot included in cost of ownership calculation.7.2 A COO calculation may have more detail thanpresented explicitly in this guide. The structure of theguide however allows for the proper handling of thesesituations. 8 Procedures8.1 The CEOC algorithm requires the specification ofthe volume level and the enumeration of appropriatefixed and recurring costs associated with processingthat volume. The CEOC metric is a function expressedas the sum of a number of categories which constitute aclassification system as given in SEMI E35. Each itemin the classification system should be defined, a methodfor evaluating its expression given, and default valuesor handling specified. The cost of equipment ownershipis a sum over the elements in the Category Table asexpressed in Equation 2 and defined in SEMI E35.8.2 Each item in the classification system is defined, amethod for evaluating its expression given, and defaultvalues or handling specified. All costs must be assignedthrough the classification system and calculated persystem for the number of production hours.

It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Direct measurement of charge usually requires theuse of a coulombmeter. Charges on an isolatedconductor can be measured by transferring the chargeinto the coulombmeter by contacting the isolatedconductor with the coulombmeter input probe. Chargeson isolated conductors and insulators can be measuredby transferring the charged object into a Faradayenclosure that is connected to the coulombmeter. Thesemeasurements can be relatively precise if care is takenin the transfer process to avoid changing the chargelevel when making the measurements.3.2 Direct measurement of charge is often impractical.In these instances, charge is indirectly evaluated bydetecting the electrostatic field from a charged surfaceusing an electrostatic fieldmeter or an electrostaticvoltmeter.3.3 This guide does not describe in strumentation andtechniques capable of making highly precise measurement of electrostatic charge. It is not suitablefor measurement of electrostatic charge on smallobjects, such as packaged devices (i.e., reading(s)obtained are indicative/general area and not precise/minute). No methods of preconditioning the surfaceprior to measurements and no methods of character-izing the basic electrostatic performance of materials,such as tribocharging, resistance, and decay rate are apart of this document.

Electrostatic fieldmetersare calibrated and recommended for use at a particulardistance from the charged object. Fieldmeters are bestsuited for making general surveys or audits, for makingmeasurements of surfaces at very high potentials(charge levels), and for making measurements whenlong-term stability is not important. They are not wellsuited for measurements of surfaces with very lowpotentials or when high spatial resolution of the surfacepotential is needed.7.1.1.1 The electrostatic locator/field s ensor/fieldmeter will henceforth be referred to as the fieldmeter.Note that for measurements to be taken in the presenceof air ionization, a chopper stabilized fieldmeter isrequired. The fieldmeter must be capable of makingfield measurements at a distance of 2.54 centimeters(cm) = 1 inch or less, from the field source to the sensorfor this guide, as written. However, see Section 7.2.5for fieldmeters that are operated at fixed distance(s),and adjust values in this document where applicable.7.1.2 Electrostatic Voltmeter  An electrostaticvoltmeter nulls the electrostatic field at its sensor(probe). An electrostatic voltmeter indicates thepresence and approximate level of the charge(s)creating the electrostatic field. Under appropriateconditions, electrostatic voltmeters provide a betterapproximation of the charge level as compared toelectrostatic fieldmeters. Electrostatic voltmeters arerelatively free of drift and more environmentally stableas compared to fieldmeters.7.1.2.1 Electrostatic voltmeters are we ll suited forfixed installation in equipment. Electrostatic voltmetersexhibit a high degree of accuracy that is independent ofthe distance from the charge. Thus, they are consideredbetter suited for making more accurate and repeatablemeasurements as compared to fieldmeters. The probecan be located very close to a charged surface withoutarc-over, and, under appropriate conditions, can resolvea small spatial area on a surface.7.1.2.2 Electrostatic voltmeters are be st suited formaking measurements of surfaces at potentials below20kV, or when a calibrated or fixed distance from theprobe to the surface cannot be maintained. They arealso best suited for measuring low surface potentials, orwhen it is desired to resolve a small area on the surface. Electrostatic voltmeters are unsuitable for measuringsurfaces at very high potentials, such as above 20kV.7.1.2.3 The electrostatic voltmeter wil l henceforth bereferred to as the voltmeter.7.1.3 Electrometer  An electromet er is a contactvoltmeter with a very high input impedance. Ideally,this input impedance would be infinite. In practice, it islimited by intrinsic physical materials properties ofinsulators and by stray leakage paths between the inputterminals. Low voltage electrometers (below 200 Volt)have typical input resistances of 10 14 ohms, accuraciesbetter than 0.1%, and can resolve microVolt typepotentials. High voltage electrometers (Kilovolts)usually rely on resistive voltage dividers and havetypical input resistances in the 10 11 ohms range withaccuracies in the 1% range. It is important to evaluateand understand the burden that the input impedance ofan electrometer represents when measuring voltagepotentials on very small charged structures.7.1.4 Charged Plate Monitor  A c harged platemonitor is an instrument typically used to monitor theperformance of air ionization equipment. Monitoring isdone with an electrically isolated 15 cm  15 cm (6inches  6 inches) metal plate, henceforth referred to asthe plate. The instrument typically provides a meansto charge the plate to a known voltage (1000 or 5000volts of either polarity), a plate sensor to determine thevoltage on the plate, and timing circuitry to determinethe time required to discharge the plate to a percentageof its initial charge. For the purposes of this guide, thecharged plate monitor, or a separate isolated plateassembly, can be used for performance verificationpurposes as explained in Section 7.2.7.2 Equipment Performance Verif ication (ConfidenceTest)7.2.1 Performance Verification of a C oulombmeter Refer to Figure 1.7.2.1.1 Zero the coulombmeter prior t o eachmeasurement.7.2.1.2 Maintain a reference calibratio n capacitor. Itshould be a polystyrene or polypropylene 10 nFcapacitor (Mallory SX-110 or equivalent). Measure thevalue of the capacitor to better than 1%. It is importantto handle the reference calibration capacitor verycarefully. Do not hold the capacitor by its body ordischarge it by touching both leads with the fingers.Hold the capacitor by one lead only. Use a clip leadconnected between ground and this lead of the capacitorto maneuver the other lead of the capacitor between thehot side of the charging source and the input terminalof the coulombmeter."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 5 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E43-0301 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 20013 7.2.1.3 Charge the reference calibratio n capacitor to 1volt with a charging source (power supply).

Use of a suitable power supply or acharged plate monitor for test purposes isrecommended.7.2.2.3 Assuring Meters and Operator Are Grounded Assure that the fieldmeter, voltmeter and operatorare grounded. Turn on the meter and zero it as requiredaccording to manufacturer's instructions.7.2.2.4 Directing or Pointing the Sens e Head  Director point the sense head of the fieldmeter or voltmeter atthe center and parallel to the surface of the plate at adistance at least twice the manufacturers recommendedmeasurement. Slowly move the sense head toward thecenter of the charged plate until a reading equal to thevoltage applied to the plate in Section 7.2.2.1 above isdisplayed by the meter. Measure and record thedistance from the sense head to the surface to the plate.Using the plate voltage from Section 7.2.2.1 above andthe recorded distance, compute the field strength for thefieldmeter. See Figure 2, Fieldmeter and VoltmeterVerification Check.7.2.2.5 Alternative to Section 7.2.2.4  Takemeasurements at a specified/fixed distance per manufacturer's instructions. Locate the sense head ofthe fieldmeter or voltmeter as in Section 7.2.2.4, but, atspecified distance; reading displayed (on meter) shouldbe within 5% of applied voltage to plate.NOTE 1: Section 7.2.2.4 or 7.2.2.5 should be applicable tomost meters. However, in every case, the electrostaticfieldmeter or voltmeter manufacturer's instructions should beread, understood, and followed. 7.2.2.6 Other Desired Test Voltages  RepeatSections 7.2.2.4 and 7.2.2.5 for any other desired testvoltages.7.2.3 Performance Verification of an Electrometer It is good practice to occasionally check theperformance of the electrometer by connecting it to aknown voltage source, and comparing its readings withreadings taken by another reference voltmeter.7.2.4 Meter Stability  All measure ment devicesshould be turned on and pre-conditioned for as long awarm-up period as recommended by the manufacturer7.2.4.1 Reset (zero) the coulombmeter prior to eachmeasurement.7.2.4.2 Check the zero on the fieldmet er or voltmeteras specified by the manufacturer. Usually this is donewhile the probe is positioned to view a groundedsurface. If the zero of the meter has drifted by morethan 5% of the test voltage for any range contained inTable 1, the meter is not suitable for use formeasurements over that range. It may be suitable foruse over other ranges contained in Table 1, using othertest voltages. Reverify the meters calibration at theselected test voltage.7.2.4.3 Zeroing an Electrometer  Ex cept on someolder analog models, there are usually no provisions tozero an electrometer. Some electrometers with analogor digital read-outs do allow offsetting of a reading, aswell as relative (delta) measurements. However, theelectronic zero of the electrometer is usually set by themanufacturer, and should be part of the normalcalibration. It is good practice to occasionally check thezero by shorting the input terminals together andverifying that the zero reading is within themanufacturers specifications.7.2.4.4 See Related Information 1 for notes onequipment accuracy and limitations. 8 Sampling8.1 Sampling methods for this gui de should bedetermined by the requirements of the user's appli-cation.

However, any measure-ment that is in excess of a (user) defined maximum orthat is a benchmark value, should be repeated more thanonce, after performing a zero check of the measuringequipment. This is to validate previous reading(s)and/or establish a range/bounds in the case of varying-moving fields on previous reading(s). 9 Test Methods & Measurem ents9.1 Coulombmeter Measurements9.1.1 Verifying the Coulombmeter  Verify theperformance of the coulombmeter as in Section 7above. Check/reset the zero before each measurementand/or per manufacturer's instructions. Assure that thecoulombmeter and operator are grounded.9.1.2 Equipment Selection  Use a c oulombmeter fordirect measurement of charge. A feedback-typecoulombmeter is recommended for chargemeasurements for the most complete transfer of charge.Shunt-type coulombmeters do not completely transfercharge and are not as straightforward to use asfeedback-type coulombmeters. When using a Faradayenclosure, the Faraday enclosure must be large enoughto hold the objects to be measured. The Faradayenclosure is used to measure charge on insulatingmaterials as well as on conductors.9.1.3 Measurements  Best results are achieved whenall surfaces surrounding the measurement area aregrounded (to minimize the effects of stray fields on themeasurement) and when a consistent, systematichandling method is used during the measurementprocess. The operator should be grounded using agrounded wrist strap.9.1.3.1 Isolated Conductors  To me asure the chargeon an isolated conductor, touch the lead from thecoulombmeter to the isolated conductor.9.1.3.2 Faraday Enclosure Measurem ents  Refer toFigure 3. To measure the charge on an object, carefullypick up the object with an insulated tool and place the charged object into the Faraday enclosure. Specialhandling considerations: Be careful not to add orsubtract any charge in the process of moving thecharged object into the Faraday enclosure. Dont let thecharged object rub or slide against any other surface, asthis may add or subtract charge from the object.9.1.4 Limitations  Do not attempt to measurecharges of magnitudes that are below the drift rate ofthe coulombmeter.9.2 Electrostatic Fieldmeter Meas urements9.2.1 Verifying the Fieldmeter  Ve rify theperformance of the fieldmeter as in Section 7 above.Check/reset the zero periodically and/or permanufacturer's instructions. Assure that the fieldmeterand operator are grounded.9.2.2 Measurements  Measuremen ts made to thisguide should be taken/reported in units that conform tothe customer specifications. Most common fieldmetersmanufactured to date have operating instructions thatreflect the user doing calibration and takingmeasurements in English units of volts/inch or volts at afixed distance in inch(es) and in these cases, raw dataare reported/listed directly. The internationalcommunity specifies that units shall be in SI (StandardInternational) Metric units and the SI conversion factorin Section 7.1.1.1 will apply. However, by definition,electric field is expressed in volts per meter, and thuswould be expressed according to Table 2.9.2.2.1 For instance, when using a me ter calibratedonly at 100 volts, measurements under 4,000 volts/mwould be expressed to the nearest 400 volts/m.Measurements over 4,000 volts/m would be expressedas ",">"," 4,000 volts/m. For a meter calibrated to all threevoltages, measurements under 4,000 volts/m would beexpressed to the nearest 400 volts/m, measurementsbetween 4,000 and 40,000 volts/m would be expressedto the nearest 4,000 volts/m, and measurements over40,000 volts/m would be expressed to the nearest40,000 volts/m.

The selection of too high a measurementrange will sacrifice voltage resolution, while selectionof too low a range will cause out-of-range operation(saturation).9.3.2.1 To measure moving objects, se lect anelectrostatic voltmeter with a response speed fastenough to detect the objects when they are moving pastthe electrostatic voltmeter probe at the highestanticipated velocity.9.3.2.2 Select a side- or end-viewing p robe for theelectrostatic voltmeter as is best suited to view thetarget object or surface when the probe is installed in anapparatus.9.3.3 Measurements  Position the probe in front ofthe surface to be measured. Best results are obtainedwhen the probe is placed less than two (probe) aperturediameters from the object or surface to be measured.At these closer spacings, the effects of extraneous fieldsare minimized.9.3.3.1 To resolve a small surface area , the distancebetween the probe and the surface-under-measurementmust be less than 1/5 th of the diameter of the surfacearea to be measured. At wider spacings the surface arearesolved by the probe will exceed the surface area ofinterest, and measurement accuracy may be reducedtogether with the possibility of introducing effects ofextraneous fields to the measurement. 9.3.4 Measurement Limitations  V oltage levels onisolated conductors can be measured. Insulators do nothave a uniform surface charge distribution. Therefore,it is considered that voltage levels measured oninsulators indicate an electrostatic field strength in aparticular area.9.4 Electrometer Measurements  Measuring with anElectrometer is very similar to measuring with anyother voltmeter or multimeter.9.4.1 Connect the common termin al of theelectrometer through a test lead to the reference planeor ground. Connect the hot or signal lead to the objector test point of interest. Some electrometermeasurements will use a separate wire or shieldconnected to the electrical ground or a guard ring.Connect this as recommended by the manufacturer ofthe equipment.9.4.2 The major difference between the ordinaryvoltmeter and the electrometer is the orders ofmagnitude higher input impedance of the electrometer.An electrometer will therefore pick up voltage signalsproduced by stray electric fields, potentials associatedwith noise currents, and artifacts caused by intentionalor unintentional ionization of the ambient air whenmeasuring high voltages. An electrometer can, forexample, be used to measure the triboelectric and thepiezoelectric properties of a piece of coaxial cable:connect the cable under test to the electrometer, andflex it or tap on it with a finger. The voltages inducedon the center conductor can be measured by theelectrometer. 10 Certification10.1 Certification to survey areas to this guide is forthe person doing the certification (certifier) to assurethat the person being certified (certifyee) can calibratethe meter and make acceptable measurement of knownstatic field(s) per Section 7 and applicable example(s)per Section 9.

R1-1 A charged conductive plate establishes a uniformelectrostatic field as long as measurements are not madeclose to the edges and the measurement distance issmall relative to the dimensions of the plate. Thisspecification requires meters capable of making fieldmeasurements at a distance of 2.54 cm (1 inch) or lessfrom a 15 cm (6 inch) square plate as a practical meansto ensure performance verification to a known field.R1-2 Charged plate monitors using 15 cm square plateswith a 20 picofarad capacitance are commonly used todetermine the performance of air ionization systems.Isolators are used to assure minimal leakage to ground.A 15 cm square plate of any metal approximately 1 mmthick and isolated from adjacent surfaces usinginsulative standoffs is a perfectly acceptable substitute.R1-3 The verification procedure is intended to ensurethat the meter used does not drift excessively (less than5% in 5 minutes) and can repeatedly measure a knownfield to within 5%. When actually using the meter to doa field survey, maintaining the correct distance from thesensor head to the surface or object being measuredbecomes the greatest source of error. If the ability of themeter operator to maintain the correct distance is within10%, then the total error of the measurement would bewithin about 12% using this calibration procedure(RMS of the 5% drift, 5% repeatability, and 10%distance errors).R1-4 If two operators using two different metersfollow the verification procedure, and they both areable to maintain the correct distance to within 10% asabove, then they both would be within 12% of the truefield strength when measuring the same surface orobject.

However, it contains relevant information for using thestandard in situations commonly encountered with semiconductor manufacturing facilities and equipment. Determination of thesuitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user.R2-1 Prior handling and environmental conditions willsignificantly impact the field strength to be measured.Below are a number of these considerations:  The presence of nearby grounded surface or objectwill tend to reduce the measured field strength.This phenomena is known as field suppression andis illustrated in Figure R2-1. Ionization of the surrounding air will tend toreduce the measured field strength by neutralizingthe static charge on the surface of the object. Rubbing or contacting the surface being measuredwith another object or surface will tend to increasethe measured field strength depending upon thetendency of the two materials in question totribocharge. Increasing humidity will tend to reduce the fieldstrength to be measured because it in turn willreduce the magnitude of the charge generated onobjects and, over time, assist in the neutralizationof charge on objects. Projections and sharp protrusions on the objectbeing measured, or nearby objects, will increasethe field strength. Insulating objects may have very irregular chargedistributions. As a result of these considerations, a staticmeasurement or survey made using this standard isonly useful if these factors are taken into account ina realistic manner. For example: If a surface is only used in a humidity ortemperature controlled environment, fieldstrength measurements made under theseconditions are the main ones of interest.Measurements made at different humiditiesmay be irrelevant.  An object may present close to zero field in anionized environment, yet when contacted byanother object may become highly charged.This charge may persist for a period of secondsor minutes while it is neutralized by the ionizedenvironment. The time required to return theobject to its original state may be a parameterof interest. An object resting on a grounded metal surfacemay have very low external field strength. Ifthe object is picked up and measured the fieldmay be much higher. Objects of irregular shape and size will givehighly variable readings, depending on theposition of the sensor relative to the object. Dielectric objects may give highly variablereadings, depending upon the position of thesensor relative to the charge distribution on theobject. The simple act of handling an object whileperforming a static survey can change thecharge on the object. The best results willderive from making sure that objects andsurfaces are treated and handled within thebounds of their actual use. During equipment verification, maintainingconstant/steady voltage is important. If the plate isinitially charged and allowed to float, its voltagewill change as the meter is moved close to it."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 15 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E43-0301 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 200113 + + + + + + + + + + + + + Grounded Surface Field Lines Terminate on Groundand Do Not AccuratelyRepresent Charge on the Surface Charged Surface Field Lines Due to Static Charge + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + Figure R2-1Field Suppression"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 16 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E43-0301 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2001 14 RELATED INFORMATION 3ESD DAMAGE SIMULATORS NOTE: This related information is not an official part of this standard.

We note here that theresulting waveform is dependent on the impedance ofthe circuity.R3-1.4 The component level CDM ESD Simulatorrepresents the parameters agreed upon for a standard,which represents the discharge from a charged device.These parameters are defined by the resultingwaveform and depend almost exclusively on thecapacitance, resistance and inductance of each devicerelative to ground.

However, it contains relevant information for using thestandard in situations commonly encountered with semiconductor manufacturing facilities and equipment. Determination of thesuitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user. R4-1 IntroductionR4-1.1 Static charge generation is unavoidablewhenever materials come in contact. Without a staticcontrol program, the problems caused by static chargeare also unavoidable. The most common problemcaused by static charge is electrostatic discharge (ESD).ESD results in damaged semiconductor ICs, photomaskdefects, magneto-resistive (MR) read head defects indisk drives, and failures of the drive circuits for flatpanel displays (FPD). ESD also creates a significantamount of electromagnetic interference (EMI). Oftenmistaken for software errors, EMI resulting from ESDinterrupts the operation of production equipment. Thisis particularly true of equipment depending on high-speed microprocessors for control. Results includeunscheduled downtime, increased maintenancerequirements, and frequently, product scrap.Technology trends to smaller device geometries, fasteroperating speeds, and increased circuit density makeESD problems worse. 6 R4-1.2 For many years static control programsconcentrated on protecting components from the chargegenerated on the personnel that handled them. Manystatic control methods were devised to control thecharge on people including wrist and heel straps,dissipative shoes and flooring, and garments.Increasingly, however, the production of electroniccomponents is done by automated equipment, andpersonnel never come into contact with the static-sensitive devices. Solving the ESD problem meansassuring that ESD events do not occur in the equipmentused to manufacture and test electronic components. R4.2 Static Control in EquipmentR4-2.1 An effective static control program inequipment starts with grounding all materials that mightcome close to, or in contact with the static sensitivecomponents. This prevents the generation of staticcharge on machine components and eliminates them asa source of the charge creating ESD events. Care mustbe taken in a grounding program to assure that movingequipment parts remain grounded when they are in 6 Levit, L. et al, Its the Hardware. No, Software. No, Its ESD!,Solid State Technology, May 1999, Pennwell Publishing Company,98 Spit Brook Road, Nashua NH 03062. motion. In some cases, static dissipative materials maybe substituted for conductive materials whereflexibility, thermal insulation, or other properties notavailable in conductive materials are needed. Ifcharging of components is unavoidable, staticdissipative materials may be used to slow the resultingdischarges and prevent component damage.R4-2.2 Most semiconductors use insulating packagingmaterials such as ceramics and epoxy. Handling theseinsulating materials inevitably generates static charge,and this charge cannot be removed by grounding thematerials. If charge generation is unavoidable, the onlyeffective method of neutralizing the charge oninsulators or isolated conductors is to use air ionization.Ionizers are typically mounted in the load stations andprocess chambers of the automated equipment toneutralize the static charge. R4-3 Verifying Equipment Static ControlR4-3.1 A static control program begins when theautomated equipment is designed by the OEM, and thencontinues throughout the lifetime of the equipment.Two basic issues need to be demonstrated. First, are allcomponents in the product-handling path connected toground? Second, as the product passes through theequipment, is it handled in a way that does not generatestatic charge above an acceptable level on thecomponent? ESD Association Standard Practice,EOS/ESD SP 10.1-19997. This document contains testmethods to verify the integrity of the ground path toequipment parts, as well as to determine if the productis being charged during its passage through theequipment. The test methods are applicable during theoriginal design of the equipment and during acceptancetesting by the end user.R4-3.2 While the test methods of EOS/ESD SP10.1-1999 can also be used for periodic verification of theequipment performance, they have one drawback. Theautomated equipment must be taken off-line to do thetesting. This means that there is lost production time,and often the periodic testing is eliminated to maintainproduct throughput. Other test methods are available 7 EOS/ESD SP10.1 - 1999 Standard Practice for Protection ofElectrostatic Discharge Susceptible Items - Automated HandlingEquipment, ESD Association, 700 Turin Road, Rome NY 13440."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 19 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E43-0301 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 200117 that can be performed with the equipment operating on-line, without altering or disturbing its operation. R4-4 ESD and EMIR4-4.1 When ESD occurs, the discharge time isusually 10 nanoseconds or less. Discharging energy inthis short time interval results in the generation ofbroadband electromagnetic radiation 8, as well as theheat that damages semiconductor components. Thiselectromagnetic radiation, especially in the 10 MHz to2 GHz frequency range, is the EMI that can affect theoperation of production equipment. In addition to ESDdamage to semiconductor devices and reticles, ESD-caused EMI results in a variety of equipment operatingproblems including stoppages, software errors, testingand calibration inaccuracies, and mishandling causingphysical component damage.R4-4.2 EMI LocatorsR4-4.2.1 When component damage or equipmentproblems due to ESD are suspected, it may be useful todetect the electromagnetic interference (EMI) generatedby the ESD event. This type of testing is both a startingpoint for determining that static charge has beengenerated, and it is a measurement point to ascertainthat any static control methods have been successful.EMI locators measure dynamic operating conditions, asit is usually not necessary to interrupt equipmentoperations to make measurements.R4-4.3 Types of EMI LocatorsR4-4.3.1 EMI locators are available in a number ofdifferent forms. In its simplest form, it consists of anAM radio tuned off station. A popping noise will beheard when an ESD event occurs. At the most complexit consists of a wideband (greater than 1 GHz) digitalstorage oscilloscope with a set of appropriate antennas,probes, and software. Measurements of radiatedinterference can be made using antennas while probescan be connected to equipment parts or electronics andpower lines.R4-4.3.2 An oscilloscope attached to a single antennacan assist in pinpointing the actual location of the ESDevent. 8, 9, 10, 11 A set of antennas can be used to not only 8 Tonoya, Watanabe and Honda, Impulsive EMI Effects from ESDon Raised Floor, 1994 EOS/ESD Symposium, pp. 164-169, ESDAssociation.9 Takai, Kaneko and Honda, One of the Methods of Observing ESDAround Electronic Equipments, 1996 EOS/ESD Symposium, pp.186-192, ESD Association.10 Greason, Bulach and Flatley, Non-Invasive Detection andCharacterization of ESD Induced Phenomena in Electronic Systems,1996 EOS/ESD Symposium, pp. 193-202, ESD Association.11 Smith, A New Type of Furniture ESD and Its Implications, 1993EOS/ESD Symposium, pp. 3-7, ESD Association. detect the presence of an ESD event, but to determinethe location of the pulse in 3 dimensions. 12, 13 Using thesame concept as a global positioning system (GPS), thedifference in the arrival times of the signal to multipleantennas is directly related to the difference in thedistance of each antenna from the ESD source. With thetime deltas and the locations of the antennas known, thelocation of the spark can be uniquely identifiedemploying the appropriate analysis program.R4-4.3.3 Several other types of EMI locatingequipment are currently in use. Most consist of highfrequency receiving circuitry followed by leveldetectors to determine the magnitude of the signal. Forthe purpose of detecting EMI from ESD events, theequipment should have some way of differentiating theshort impulse of EMI from the ESD event from thecontinuous high frequency radiation of other EMIsources. Some instruments contain a counter to totalthe number of ESD events above the threshold, oralarms to indicate when the number of ESD eventsexceeds a preset number. This type of instrument can beplaced near a piece of equipment that is suspected ofcausing ESD events and left in place to monitor.R4-4.3.4 Several EMI Locators are battery-operatedhandheld devices that can be easily carried around afacility or placed directly in equipment to check forESD events. This allows the Locator to detect signalsthat might otherwise be shielded by the equipmentscover panels. (Note that EMI shielding is usually animportant part of the design of most productionequipment to prevent radiation from the equipment.This makes the detection of ESD events outside theequipment more difficult.) It allows pinpointing of thelocation of an ESD event, which can then be correlatedto particular machine operations. 8, 14 R4-4.4 Limitation in Using EMI LocatorsR4-4.4.1 One caution needs to be observed when usingEMI locators to detect ESD events that causecomponent damage. The signal received by thesedevices is generated in areas usually surrounded bygrounded metal components. It may have to passthrough equipment panels and travel some distancethrough the air before it reaches the detector. There may 12 Bernier, Croft, and Lowther ESD Sources Pinpointed by Analysisof Radio Wave Emissions, Journal of Electrostatics (44) pp. 149-157, Nov. 1998, Elsevier Science B.V., P.O.

The actual location ofthe ESD event may be a considerable distance from theEMI locator. It will be difficult to establish anycorrelation between the amplitude of the signal receivedby the EMI locator and the energy in the ESD eventthat produced the signal. The EMI locator primarilyindicates the occurrence of an ESD event and can beused to illustrate that a particular static control methodhas eliminated it. It should not be assumed that everyESD event detected results in damage to components orequipment problems. Additional testing will be neededto establish that connection. R4-5 Static Event DetectorsR4-5.1 Static event detectors (SED) are devices thatare installed directly on products to detect the presenceof an ESD event. They may be attached in proximity toan ESD-sensitive component, connected to the externaldevice leads, or integrated into the device package.Typically they detect the current pulse of an ESD eventthrough an antenna or direct connection to the devicecircuitry.R4-5.2 SEDs can be useful in determining theoccurrence of ESD events in operating productionequipment. The SED has the ability to indicate ESDevents of a known level, aiding in the design andperformance verification of automated equipment.While costly analysis of failed devices can also providethis information, correlation to machine operations isusually difficult. An SED that can be monitoredoptically as it passes through operating equipmentprovides a convenient method to verify that automatedequipment is not generating levels of static charge thatresult in ESD damage. R4-5.3 Types of SED DevicesR4-5.3.1 In some SED devices, the signal is amplifiedand processed to produce a reflectance change in thebuilt-in Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). The SED isdesigned to trip at a predetermined threshold voltage,detecting ESD transients above the selected amplitude.Some devices can be reset magnetically or opticallymaking them reusable.R4-5.3.2 Other devices use the controllable ESDdamage threshold of metal oxide semiconductor fieldeffect transistors (MOSFET). The test methodology isto amplify an ESD transient to create sufficient energyto destroy the gate oxide. The device may be used untilthe specified ESD level is achieved, and then the SEDfails. A similar device is based on the metal oxidesemiconductor capacitor (MOSCAP). The currentleakage through the device significantly increases if theESD amplitude is sufficient to damage the MOS structure. Both of these types of SED must be removedfrom where they are installed and require additionalinstrumentation to determine their status.R4-5.3.3 Another type of SED employs the magneticfields from a current flow to affect a series of magneto-optic thin films. The magnetic field from the ESDcurrent alters the films magnetic state and affects thedegree of polarization of visible light reflected from thefilm. Varying the distance between the film and theESD current-carrying conductor indicates differentthresholds. This SED can be read using a microscopeequipped with a polarizing element and does not needto be removed from the circuitry to be read. It can bereset with a magnet. 15 R4-6 ConclusionR4-6.1 There is little question that static chargeproblems continue to result in significant losses in hightechnology manufacturing. Increasingly, static controlmethods must be applied in the equipment thatproduces the product. It will be important to developand utilize a range of diagnostic methods andmeasurement equipment for ESD in equipment.

The number ofmetals to be analyzed is restricted to the four elementssodium (Na), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), and copper (Cu)in order to rapidly characterize minienvironments froma practicable point of view. While Na, Ca, and Ferepresent one ensemble of highly detrimental impuritieswith respect to contamination from human sources(Na), the environment (Ca), or from equipment andcorrosive effects (Fe), Cu is analyzed due to itsincreasing importance in semiconductor manufacturing.Additionally, they are easily analyzed with sufficientlylow detection limits. It is up to the user of this testmethod to quantify additional elements. A list ofsuggested polished wafer surface metal contaminationinappropriate to circuits and devices is shown in Table1 (based on SEMI M1). The inorganic contaminationon silicon wafer surfaces is collected by VPD.2.2 To quantify Ca and Fe, VPD/TXRF is used due toits sufficiently low detection limits. Na and Cu arequantified by VPD/GFAAS or VPD/ICP-MS. Allanalytical methods are widely used for thecharacterization of surface cleanliness.2.3 This measurement technique can also be used tocheck the influence of certain process steps onminienvironments.2.4 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use.

A piece of aluminumfoil (20  30 cm2) is folded multiply and, by usingtweezers, is carefully heated in the flame until fullyconverted. After cooling down, the foil is stored on afire resistant surface (ceramics preferred).10.2.2 Preconditioning of Weighing B ottles  Thejaws of the crucible tongs are heated in the butane torchuntil they are red hot for two minutes. After a shortcooling period (15 s), the bottom of the weighing bottleis picked up. For several times, the inner and the outersurfaces of the glass are heated alternately in the torch(2 minutes for each run). After approximately 30 s ofcooling down - held in air by the tongs - the flamedweighing bottle is put down on the preconditionedaluminum foil. The tongs are allowed to cool for 15 s,then the lid is prepared in the same way. After 10minutes of cooling, the lid can be placed on theweighing bottle.10.2.3 Preconditioning of Watch Gla ss  The watchglass is picked up with preconditioned cross tweezersand carefully heated in the butane torch for 30 s(without deformation by melting).10.2.3.1 Simultaneously, the tips of a s econd pair ofcross tweezers are heated to red heat. After 30 s, thewatch glass is transferred by these tweezers, carefullyheated for another 30 s to red heat (total heating time, 1min), and placed on the preconditioned aluminum foil.After a cooling period of 5 minutes, the watch glass ispicked up with a clean pair of preconditioned crosstweezers and placed inside the weighing bottle.10.2.4 Preconditioning of Si-chips  Wafers, asreceived, are cut into chips of 20  10 mm2 in size. Theuse of cotton gloves is recommended to avoid organiccontamination through fingerprints. Then one Si-chip ispicked up with a pair of cross tweezers and heated tored hot in a butane torch (30 s). Simultaneously, the tips of a second pair of cross tweezers are heated to red hot.After 30 s, the Si-chip is transferred to these tweezersand heated for another 30 s to red heat (total heatingtime, 1 min). After cooling, the Si-chip is transferredinto the preconditioned weighing bottle. The weighingbottle must be opened and closed only with thethermally decontaminated crucible tongs.10.2.4.1 The lid must be placed only on thepreconditioned aluminum foil. Five more Si-chips arepreconditioned as described above and placed into theweighing bottle. The six Si-chips must not overlap ortouch one another. The Si-chips should be placed onthe preconditioned watch glass.10.2.5 Preparation of Polymer Mater ial  The tabletop vice is mounted on a clean work-bench. The crosstweezers, the blade of a metal saw, the scalpel, themetal vernier calliper (within the measuring range), thesteel ruler (in the range of 0 to 3 cm), and the finelytoothed metal file are thermally decontaminated.Having decontaminated the metal saw, an area ofapproximately 50  50 mm2 is sawed off the polymericmaterial and fixed with the clean cross tweezers. Thispiece of polymer material is then clamped verticallybetween the jaws of the vice. An area 12  20 mm2 iscarefully marked with the scalpel and cut out with themetal saw. Before total separation, the polymer sampleis clamped with cross tweezers while the jaws of thevice are covered with the decontaminated aluminumfoil. After clamping the polymer sample between thejaws of the vice, all sides of the polymer sample arecarefully filed to length wit ha metal file (size controlwith metal vernier caliper). Then the polymer sample isplaced on a clean watch glass by cleaned tweezers. Thewatch glass is positioned on the thermally cleanedaluminum foil. Both parts are stored inside thepreconditioned weighing bottle which is carefullyclosed with its lid. The weighing bottle, within whichthe Si-chips are stored, is wrapped in preconditionedaluminum foil for storage and transportation.10.3 IMS Measurements Procedure10.3.1 Blank Measurement  The ba ckground signallevel (noise) of the equipment must be defined bymeasuring the clean and stabilized IMS-equipment,without sample, three times for each polarity.10.3.2 Reference Measurement  Al l manipulationsetc. with the reference chemicals (Hexaphenylbenzeneand Dioctylphthalate) have to take place entirely inPFA containers etc. Following equipment is needed:2 narrow necked flasks (PFA), 250 mL2 weighing boats (PFA)!!low weight, diameter smaller than diameter ofnarrow necked flask!!"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 29 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E46-0301 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2001 4 2 pipettes (glass), 100 mL1 micro dropper with changeable tips of 2 L (maybe PP)1 micro spatula (metal)1 micro balance, measuring range 10-6 g to 1 g atleast10.3.2.1 Preparation of the reference measurementwith HPB:10.3.2.1.1 Before the HPB is weighed, th e PFA-bottleand the weighing boat have to be cleaned. For this theweighing boat and 10 mL benzene are given into thebottle. The bottle is closed and shaken well for approx.1 minute. The benzene is discarded. This procedure isrepeated four times. After the last cleaning the emptyopen bottle and the weighing boat, placed on adecontaminated aluminum foil (see Section 10.2.1). areallowed to dry at room temperature in a fume cupboardfor ten minutes. Then the bottle is closed. The weighingboat is placed onto the micro balance by thermallydecontaminated cross tweezers. Approx. 5 mg of HPBare weighed into the weighing boat by use of athermally decontaminated micro spatula. The weight isrecorded exactly for the later calculation. The weighingboat is placed into the PFA bottle by the cross tweezers.10.3.2.1.2 The volume of the benzene is measuredusing a 100 mL-pipette. Before use, the pipette has tobe washed 5 times using 10 mL benzene each time. The100 mL benzene are filled into the PFA flask, which isclosed immediately.10.3.2.1.3 First the bottle, now containing HPB andbenzene, is shaken well for three minutes. Often this isnot sufficient for a complete dissolution of the HPB(visible inspection). To assure complete dissolution, thePFA flask is placed into an ultrasonic bath for 5minutes (not longer, because solution may get hot).Two minutes before the end of that time the preparationof the silicon chip is started. The piece of silicon isheated to red heat for one minute, placed on thethermally decontaminated aluminum foil and given 5minutes to cool. When the treatment in the ultrasonicbath is finished, the PFA flask is shaken for threeminutes again, then given 2 minutes for just standing.10.3.2.1.4 The bottle is opened. By the micro dropper2 L are taken from near the surface (tip not more than1 mm under surface of liquid). The 2 L are spreadonto the silicon chip in such a way that the liquid on thechip covers the smallest possible area. Care is to betaken to prevent large spreading or even dropping offthe liquid (e.g., the Si chip has to be positioned flat).The liquid is given 5 minutes to evaporate (roomtemperature, no extensive blowing of air). Then themeasurement of the HPB reference can be started. 10.3.2.1.5 Before each following HPB measurementthe flask again has to be shaken 3 minutes, 5 minutesultrasonic bath, shaking 3 minutes, allow two minutesof resting. The solution of the HPB in benzene must notbe kept longer than 10 days.10.3.2.1.6 The reproducibility of the inte gral value(see calculation) achieved by this procedure is betterthan 4%. Sample measurements shall be performedonly, if the reference measurement has provided areproducibility equal to or better than 10%.NOTE 1: Hexaphenylbenzene has been chosen as a referencecompound because its signal is well-defined and its mobilityvalue is well separated from the peaks of nearly all otherrelevant organic contaminants. It provides positive ions only.A different reference, Dioctylphthalate, is needed for negativeions.10.3.2.1.7 DOP-reference samples: All th e same asHPB, except replacing the benzene by ethanol. TheDOP is weighed using a micro dropper (not spatula).10.3.2.1.8 The mobility spectrum of dioc tylphthalateis also well separated but there are several peaks due tothermal decomposition (phthalic anhydride etc.). Thiscompound is a frequently used plasticizer and thereforeone of the most critical polymer additives.10.3.3 Measurement of the Headspac e Samples Positive and negative ions are detected successively intwo separate runs. At least two independentmeasurements are carried out for each polarity. Everymeasurement to be saved consists of 2000 single scansand is then repeated. Hence, an automated measurementis required.10.3.3.1 The silicon chip is placed in th e furnace ofthe IMS using thermally decontaminated crosstweezers. The measurement of the drift time spectrum(positive or negative polarity) has to be startedimmediately after loading the desorption furnace withthe sample (time delay between sample introductionand starting of the measurement: 15 s).10.3.4 Termination of the Measureme nt  Themeasurement is terminated when the signal intensityhas decreased to about 10% above the noise of theblank measurement spectrum. If this point is notreached after two hours, the measurement should beterminated; in this case, the investigated sample doesnot show suitable material properties.10.4 Headspace Sampling in Minie nvironments The crucible tongs are preconditioned as described inSection 10.2, and the preconditioned aluminum foil isplaced beside the minienvironment that is to beexamined. After opening the minienvironment, the lidof the weighing bottle is picked up with the crucibletongs and carefully placed on the aluminum foil.

Then theminienvironment is closed and kept closed for a definedperiod of time. For this test method, one week (168 h)is defined. After expiry of the storage time, theweighing bottle is closed with its lid and removed fromthe minienvironment.10.4.1 The same procedure applies to standard waferboxes or to SMIF and similar boxes.10.5 Headspace Sampling of Polym er Material atDifferent Temperatures  The prepared polymermaterial inside the wrapped weighing bottle (seeSection 10.2.5) is stored: either under clean laboratory conditions at roomtemperature for a defined period of time or in a suitable oven at a temperature of 70\xb0C or120\xb0C for exactly 1 hour followed by a coolingperiod of 1 hour.10.5.1 The wrapped weighing bottle i s handled with apair of crucible tongs only.10.6 Testing Requirements (check f or device overloadduring measurement)10.6.1 Positive Ions: Water Cluster S ignal Intensity The water cluster signal intensity must not decrease bymore than 10% of the blank spectra intensity duringmeasurement time; otherwise, the ion molecule reactorhas been overloaded. If this is the case, the polymersample is not likely to be suitable for use insemiconductor processing because of unacceptableproperties.10.6.2 Negative Ions: Oxygen Cluster Signal Intensity The same procedure as that in Section 10.6.1 mustbe performed for negative ions; in this case, the oxygencluster signal intensity must not decrease by more than20%. 11 Calculation11.1 Description of Mobility Spectr a Evaluation The signal intensities of the detected samplecontaminants are integrated over a specific interval forboth polarities. The background signal intensity isintegrated, outside the specific measurement interval,with preference to spectral region prior to the peaks ofthe reactant ions. The total background intensity(integration of the relevant background signal) issubtracted from the integrated contamination intensity(background correction). The mean value of thecontamination signal from the blank measurement(Section 10.3.1) spectra is subtracted accordingly. Thisleads to individual contamination values from eachsample spectrum. 11.2 Calculation of reduced mobilit y: K = E -1 1d /t d andK 0 = K (p/p 0 ) (T0 /T)K : ion mobility (cm 2 /Vs)K 0 : reduced ion mobility (cm 2 /Vs)p: pressurep0 : standard pressureT : temperatureT0 : standard temperature (273.15K)l d : drift length (cm)t d : drift time (s)E : electric field strength (V/cm)K : Kelvin 11.2.1 Table 1 shows the specified in tegration range;all reduced mobility values are given in units of cm2/Vs.11.2.2 The resulting integrals for each spectrum aresummed up for the whole desorption time. This value iscompared to the appropriate value of the referencesample (HPB or DOP).11.2.3 This procedure ensures the comparison of theevaluated sample contamination values betweendifferent laboratories and measurement equipments. 12 Related Documents12.1 K.

For this reason, the purchaser needs to specify a time period and the number and type of usesto which the FOUPs will be put. It is under these conditions that the FOUPs must remain in compliance with therequirements listed in 6.5.2 Temperature Ranges  The purchaser of 300 mm FOUPs needs to specify two sets of temperatures to whichthe FOUPs might be exposed. An operating temperature range is the set of environmental temperatures in which theFOUPs will remain in compliance with the requirements listed in 6. A temporary temperature range is the set ofenvironmental temperatures to which the FOUPs can be exposed such that when the FOUPs return to the operatingtemperature range, the FOUPs will be in compliance with the requirements listed in 6. Limits on exposure times toelevated temperatures should be specified. Also, the purchaser needs to specify a range of temperatures for thewafers that might be inserted in the FOUPs.5.3 Fire Resistance  The purchaser of 300 mm FOUPs may need to consider the flammability of the FOUPs.5.4 Info Pad Configurations  The purchaser of 300 mm carriers needs to specify the desired info padconfiguration (up or down). 6 Requirements6.1 Kinematic Couplings  The physical alignment mechanism from the FOUP to the tool load-port (or a nest on avehicle or in a stocker) consists of features (not specified in this standard) on the top entity that mate with three orsix pins underneath as defined in SEMI E57. Most of the dimensions of the FOUP are determined with respect to thethree orthogonal datum planes defined in that standard: the horizontal datum plane, the facial datum plane, and thebilateral datum plane. All of the dimensions for the FOUP are bilaterally symmetric about both the bilateral andfacial datum planes with the following exceptions: The features that mate with the kinematic coupling pins and the FOUP sensing pads are symmetrical only aboutthe bilateral datum plane. The FOUP has a door only on the front and conveyor rails on the left and right sides that are required to extendall the way to the front. The orientation notches on the robotic handling flange are different for each of the four sides.The three features that mate with the kinematic coupling pins must provide a lead-in capability that corrects a FOUPmisalignment of up to r69 in any horizontal direction.6.2 (This section, Internal Kinematic Couplings is no longer applicable, and is intentionally left blank so as tomaintain paragraph numbering.)"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 39 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E47.1-0305 \xa9 SEMI 1997, 2005 4 6.3 Interior Dimensions  The interior of the FOUP must have the interior dimensions of the cassette specified inSEMI E1.9. Many of these dimensions are measured from a horizontal datum plane, so an internal horizontal datumplane is still specified to be z44 above the horizontal datum plane under the FOUP.6.4 Door6.4.1 (This section (6.4.1) is no longer applicable, and is intentionally left blank so as to maintain paragraphnumbering.)6.4.2 , The FOUP door is on the front side of the FOUP (corresponding to the front side of the cassette wherewafers are accessed so the door is perpendicular to the wafers and parallel to the facial datum plane), and the doorand its frame must be designed to mate with a port that conforms to SEMI E62. Specifically, the FOUP door and itsframe must have surfaces that mate with the seal zones and the reserved spaces for vacuum application (whichincludes all of the circles bounded by r38 except for the holes for the registration pins at the center of each circle)defined in 5.3 and 5.6 of SEMI E62 (which specifies r38). These FOUP door and frame surfaces must be adistance of y52 from the facial datum plane and must have a flatness of y42. No surface on the FOUP door mayproject further from the facial datum plane than the door seal zone and the reserved spaces for vacuum application.The door of the FOUP must also be designed so that when the FOUP is pressed against the FIMS port, both latchkeys on the port are inserted to their full length. Furthermore, when the latch keys are turned more than 45\xb0 towardthe position that unlocks the FOUP door from the FOUP, the latch key holes on the door must be such that the dooris not removable from the latch keys.6.5 Wafer Capture and Centering  When the FOUP is closed, the wafers must be captured in the FOUP toprevent movement during transport. Wafer capture must include gently pushing the wafers to the rear of the cassetteto center them.6.6 Internal Dimensions The interior of any FOUP must not intrude on the end effector exclusion zone, and theinside of the door must not intrude more that y51 toward the facial datum plane. The interior of the FOUP betweeny11 and the door opening must not protrude higher than z6 above the internal horizontal datum plane and lower thanz15 above the top nominal wafer plane. Horizontally, it must not protrude closer to the bilateral datum plane thanx51 between y11 and y49 or closer than x52 between y49 and y52 (as shown in Figure 10). Dimensions x51, x52,y49, and y52 are specified in Table 1, and y11, z6, and z15 are specified in SEMI E1.9.6.7 External Dimensions  Figures 5 through 8 show the side view, rear view, top view, and bottom view for theFOUP. Table 1 defines all of the dimensions. In this and following figures, the heaviest lines are used for surfacesthat have tolerances (not surfaces that have only maximum or only minimum dimensions). If a FOUP identificationtag is used, it must be located at the bottom rear centered on the bilateral datum plane and must be contained withinthe maximum outer dimensions of the FOUP.
