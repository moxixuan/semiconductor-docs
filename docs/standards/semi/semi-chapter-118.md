Thus, if a mask is to be used to produce metalinterconnects, the area representing non-metal is thefield. The image polarity is named by the appearanceof this field; thus, clear field, dark (opaque) field. Thisdefinition is very carefully stated because, in somedevices, their gross appearance is very deceiving in thatfield cannot always be denoted as the major area.Some devices may have diffusion of buried layers, forinstance, covering 80% of the area, the remaining 20%being the field. Some knowledge of the fabricationprocess is essential when determining field, as many ofthese ambiguous conditions exist where the field is lessthan 50% of the area.

The problem of measuringfeature sizes on photomasks or integrated circuit wafers(e.g., linewidth) is complicated by the fact that a featureis a 3-dimensional object whose exact shape isgenerally not known. The metrology problem is furthercomplicated when the object is microscopic and only itsmagnified image can be measured.4.2 Feature measurement data are usually reduced toone or a few parameters because the additional dataneeded to describe the complex actual feature shape areseldom available and may be immaterial to thesubsequent application of the measurement data.4.3 The first rule of metrology is to define exactly whatis to be measured. The approach used here, in light ofthe previous paragraphs, is to construct a simpleidealized geometric shape, or feature model (Figure 1),which approximates a real object of complex shape.This model, whose size and center position are welldefined, is substituted for the real feature in applicationof the measurement data. A model can be refined tobetter approximate the actual feature shape by addingdegrees of freedom, requiring more parameters todescribe the measurement. For example, a line might berepresented by a rectangular cross section (with widthand height) or better represented by a trapezoidal crosssection (with base width, height, and two wall angles).The differences between the model and the actual shapeof the feature contribute to the overall measurementuncertainty of the size or position of that feature. 1 American National Standards Institute, Headquarters: 1819 LStreet, NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA.

SEMI P35-0704 © SEMI 2000, 2004 2 Figure 1The Feature Model Approximates the Size andShape of the Feature 4.3.1 The feature model may be further abstracted tosuit the purpose of the measurement by definingbounding boxes to represent the inner and outer limitson the space occupied by the feature. In the nonexistentcase of an ideal feature, the feature, the feature model,and the bounding boxes would all coincide.4.4 The aim of the approach embodied here is tofacilitate interpretation of metrology results for afeature (and the features subsequent performance see section A1) in the most realistic terms, and in lightof any possible additional knowledge about that feature.4.5 There are many possible reasons for measuring afeatures size or placement. Consequently the followingdefinitions may include options or alternatives, to beselected by the user to best fit the purpose of themeasurement. 5 Definitions5.1 Defined terms appearing in the definitions of otherterms are italicized. Where more than one definition isgiven for a term, the one most appropriate to theapplication is to be chosen. Some of these definitionsdescribe certain usage options as the default. Thatoption is assumed to apply unless otherwise specified.5.1.1 bounding box  a user-specified geometric shapewith a planar face lying in the reference plane and withuser-specified orientation in the reference plane,intended to represent limits or bounds on the positionand size of the feature. See Figure 2 for an example.The bounding box need not be rectangular. Figure 2Two Possible Bounding Box Choices for a LineFeatureNOTE 1: The term bounding box is used here forconvenience, but the word box may not always beconsidered appropriate. Terms like bounding figure orbounding surface may be used instead, if desired. Abounding box may coincide with a feature model.5.1.1.1 outer bounding box  smallest bounding boxencompassing the feature.5.1.1.2 best fit bounding box  bounding box bestfitting the feature, with user-defined criteria of best fit.5.1.2 calibration  set of operations that establish,under specified conditions, the relationship betweenvalues of quantities indicated by a measuringinstrument or measuring system, or values representedby a material measure or reference material, and thecorresponding values realized by standards \[referenceSection 6.1\].5.1.3 centerline  (a) The locus of the centroids ofsuccessive line segments, in the limit as the segmentlength vanishes. (b) a line or surface midway betweenopposing feature edges.5.1.4 centroid  The geometrical center of an object.The coordinates of the centroid of an object are Cu =u dV / dV, where the integral is over the volume Vof the object and u can be x, y, or z.5.1.4.1 centroid measurement uncertainty  parameterthat characterizes the dispersion of the values that couldreasonably be attributed to the position of the centroidor the placement of an object in the reference planecoordinate system (see measurement uncertainty).NOTE 2: The edges of the feature form part of the boundaryof the integral defining the centroid; edge position uncertaintyleads to integral boundary uncertainty and thus to centroiduncertainty. The centroid measurement uncertainty of afeature described by inner and outer linewidth bounding

SEMI P35-0704 © SEMI 2000, 20043 boxes is the combined uncertainties of the measured centroidposition of the mean linewidth bounding box and of thepositions of the lines edges between these linewidthbounding boxes, taking into account possible opposite edgecorrelations. (These correlations can result in featureplacement or pitch uncertainty that is less than thecorresponding linewidth uncertainty because many featureshave some degree of mirror image symmetry betweenopposite edges.)5.1.5 feature (lithographic)  region within a singlecontinuous boundary, and attached to a reference plane,that has a defining physical property (parameter) that isdistinct from the region outside the boundary. \[Adaptedfrom SEMI P28.\]NOTE 3: In general a feature is a 3-dimensional object, butsome features can be adequately modeled as 2-dimensionalobjects.5.1.5.1 feature boundary  surface defined by a user-specified property, such as a threshold, maximumgradient, etc., of the parameter distinguishing thatfeature from its surroundings. Open features, such asvias or spaces between lines, may be bounded in heightby an additional plane parallel to the reference plane.5.1.5.2 feature edge  that part of the featureboundary used to define the feature size or linewidth.The criteria used must be specified.5.1.5.3 feature height  dimension of the specifiedbounding box perpendicular to the reference plane.May also refer to feature depth below the substrate, asin contact holes. Although feature height is sometimesreferred to as feature thickness, this usage is notrecommended because thickness sometimes alludesto width.5.1.5.4 feature model  a solid geometrical shape,with well-defined parameters, e.g., length, width,height, centroid, etc. (Figure 1), meant to approximatethe actual shape of a feature boundary. Figure 3Examples of line edge bounding boxes and theresulting default centerline and linewidth. Since thetop of Line A is not parallel to the substrate, thegeneralized linewidth bounding box definition (b) isused. Line edge asperities at the substrate werejudged not to be relevant to the function of thisfeature and were excluded from the outer line edgebounding boxes. NOTE 4: A rectangular solid is often used to represent a line;a different extruded polygon may better represent the shape ofthe line. A hemisphere may best represent a solder bump.The more complex the model, more degrees of freedom areavailable to better fit the model to the feature, and moredimensional parameters are needed to describe the featuressize. The feature model is a simplified geometricapproximation of the actual feature, the bounding boxesrepresent limits on the space occupied by the feature model.The size or position of a feature can be described by the sizeor position of the feature model with appropriateuncertainties, or by the sizes or positions of the boundingboxes. This choice is left to the user, and in many of thesedefinitions the terms can be interchanged. Bounding boxes areuseful because they make the measurement uncertaintyexplicit, and because an application of the measurement datamay require only inner or outer bounds.5.1.5.5 feature placement  (a) coordinates describingthe position of the centroid of the specified boundingbox projected onto the reference plane relative to acoordinate system in that plane. (b) coordinatesdescribing positions of the features edges.5.1.5.6 feature size  dimensions of the specifiedfeature model or bounding box.5.1.5.7 nominal feature size  the intended orspecified dimension of a feature.

Line edge asperities at thesubstrate were judged not to be relevant to thefunction of this feature and were excluded from theouter linewidth bounding box. 5.1.6 line edge bounding box  (a) the region, for eachedge, between specified inner and outer linewidthbounding boxes encompassing the edge of the feature.(b) user-specified bounding box intended to encompassthe feature edge. See Figure 3.NOTE 5: The underlying concept here is the same as for afeature bounding box; only the perspective is different. If afeature is described using a pair of inner and outer linewidthbounding boxes, then the widths of the corresponding lineedge bounding boxes illustrate the component of the linewidthmeasurement uncertainty arising from the definition of thefeatures edge, and the linewidth bounding box describingthe feature is taken to mean the mean linewidth bounding boxby default.5.1.7 line edge position  expectation value of theposition of the edge within the line edge bounding boxused to define the linewidth. If the probabilitydistribution of the edge within the line edge boundingbox is symmetric, this will be at the center of the lineedge bounding box.5.1.8 linewidth bounding box  (a) if the featureheight is unambiguous, a specified rectangularbounding box constrained to the line height andbounding a specified line length segment; (b)appropriate parameters describing a different boundingbox. Additional constraints, such as orientation parallelto a defined length direction, may be placed on thebounding box. See Figure 4.5.1.8.1 linewidth  (a) width of a specified linewidthbounding box. See Figures 3 and 4. (b) distancebetween the two opposing line edge positions of afeature. See Figures 5, 6, and 7.NOTE 6: Linewidth is sometimes referred to as criticaldimension or CD. 5.1.8.2 best fit linewidth  width of constrained bestfit linewidth bounding box.5.1.8.3 mean linewidth bounding box  a boundingbox between inner and outer linewidth bounding boxes,whose right and left edge positions at any height abovethe substrate are the means of the edge positions of theinner and outer linewidth bounding boxes at that height.See Figues 4 and 5.5.1.8.4 inner bound linewidth  width of largestlinewidth bounding box entirely inside the line segment.Its width is the smallest linewidth that is ordinarilyassociated with the feature. Figure 5Example of using rectangular and trapezoidallinewidth bounding boxes to describe Line A inFigure 4. The trapezoidal case requires anadditional specification for the linewidth, such as atthe distance h above the reference plane, but itprobably better represents the real feature and thewidth of its line edge bounding box is smaller. 5.1.8.5 outer bound linewidth  width of smallestlinewidth bounding box encompassing the line segment.Line edge asperities may reasonably be excluded. Itswidth is the largest linewidth that is ordinarilyassociated with the feature.5.1.8.6 section linewidth  width of the planarrectangle defining the intersection of a linewidthbounding box and a plane parallel to and a specifieddistance from the reference plane.5.1.8.7 linewidth measurement uncertainty parameter that characterizes the dispersion of the valuesthat could reasonably be attributed to the linewidth ofan object (see measurement uncertainty).5.1.8.7.1 One option here is to choose inner and outerlinewidth bounding boxes so that there is a 95% chancethat the lines true edges lie between them. Then thelinewidth measurement uncertainty will be thecombined uncertainties of the measured width of themean linewidth bounding box and of the positions ofthe lines edges between these linewidth boundingboxes, taking into account possible right-left edgecorrelations. This option is the default.

Since the intention in thiscase is to conform to the irregular shape of the edge,the generalized linewidth bounding box definition (b)is used. The inner, outer, and mean linewidthbounding boxes coincide, and the linewidth is definedto be the width of the mean linewidth bounding boxat a specified distance h above the substrate.Alternatively, the line edge bounding box approachcan be used here, giving the same results. 5.1.11 measurement uncertainty  parameter,associated with the result of a measurement, thatcharacterizes the dispersion of the values that couldreasonably be attributed to the measurand \[referenceSection 6.1\]. Numerically, it is the square root of thesum of the variances of the probability distributions ofall the possible errors (both random and systematic),multiplied by a stated factor chosen to represent thedesired confidence interval (usually 2 for 95% or 3 for99% for normally distributed errors), as described inANSI/NCSL Z540- 2-1997 \[reference Section 3.2\].

SEMI P35-0704 © SEMI 2000, 20047 APPENDIX 1SOME GENERAL NOTES ON LINEWIDTH METROLOGYNOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI P35 and was approved by full letter ballotprocedures on April 22, 2004. A1-1 A metrology process can be represented by theoperation process model  feature model  output model. A1-1.1 Here the process model represents themetrology process. These models are abstractions of thecomplex realities they represent, a simplificationusually required in order to make the modeling tractableand the measurement practical. The output model ofthis metrology process is the feature model (Section5.5.4) with the metrology results attached, including theassociated measurement uncertainty. Measurementuncertainty arises from inevitable differences betweenboth the process and feature models and their respectiverealities. The measurement error (Section 5.10) is thedifference between the measurement result and theunknown true value, and the measurement uncertainty(Section 5.11) is expressed as a confidence intervalrepresenting the variance of the measurement errors.The measurement uncertainty includes componentsfrom model infidelity in addition to scale calibration,repeatability, environmental factors, etc. A confidenceinterval of 95% (or 2 for normally distributed errors)is used in the examples, in accordance withinternational custom. That is, the likelihood that the truevalue of the measurand (Section 5.9) lies within therange (measurement result ± measurement uncertainty)is 95%.A1-1.2 A manufacturing process can be represented ina similar manner. In particular, if that process is waferexposure, then the same feature model for thephotomask features can be used for both the maskmetrology and exposure processes: exposure model  photomask feature model wafer feature model. A1-1.3 Errors and uncertainties in the photomaskfeature model propagate through the exposure model tobecome manufacturing errorsdifferences between awafer features size or placement and its target valueand manufacturing uncertainties. In analogy withmeasurement uncertainty, tolerances on wafer featuresencompass mask measurement uncertainties, includingdifferences between the models and their respective realities, as well as the effects of tolerances forexposure parameters and photomask features. The maskerror enhancement factor (MEEF) and other opticalproximity effects are good examples of the waferexposure model operating on photomask feature sizeand placement variations to produce nonlinearvariations in wafer feature size and placement undersome conditions. A1-2 Real microlithographic features (Section 5.5)often have irregular shapes and rough edges; it isneither possible nor necessary to know the exact shapeof a feature to be measured. The purpose of the featurebounding boxes (Section 5.1) defined here is to accountfor such edge details as top-to-bottom runout and along-the-line irregularities that are often observed. In suchcases the bounding boxes help define the measurand(Section 5.9). To the extent that such details are notknown, not relevant, or too complex to be considered,the bounding boxes represent the feature with a simplergeometry and mix these disregarded details into themeasurement uncertainty. For the ideal line with knownedge geometry and no edge irregularities, the inner,mean, and outer linewidth bounding boxes (Sections5.8.35.8.5) can be identical and the line edge boundingbox (Section 5.6) can have zero width. The boundingbox approach simplifies metrology issues for the quasi-thin-film features often encountered inmicrolithography. Extension of the concept tostructures with nonplanar top surfaces or extendingbelow the reference plane (Section 5.14) becomes morecomplicated. A1-3 A great deal of flexibility has been incorporatedinto some of these definitions. This is because thedefinition of a measurand (Section 5.9) can depend onthe purpose for which a measurement is made, and themeasurement error depends on the definition of themeasurand. It is up to the user to specify or define themeasurand in a way that suits his present purpose and inan unambiguous way. Otherwise interpretation of themeasurement result may be in error and themeasurement uncertainty may be meaningless orimpossible to ascertain. In other words, the truevalues of feature edge positions, centerline (Section5.3), centroid (Section 5.4), and linewidth (Section5.8.1), can depend on the purpose to which thecorresponding measurement results are put. Thedefinitions given here allow for some flexibility so they

&lt;!-- Page 23 --&gt;

SEMI P35-0704 © SEMI 2000, 2004 8 can be made consistent with the ultimate purpose of themeasurements. A1-4 The inner and outer linewidth bounding boxesneed not have the same shape, but their widths must beunambiguously defined. A rectangular shape for bothwill result in a centerline, centroid, and linewidthindependent of height above the substrate, but may alsoresult in a larger interval between the inner and outerlinewidth bounding boxes. The figure 95% represents 2standard deviations of the Gaussian probabilitydistribution of possible values for the linewidth. Themultiplier value of 2 (the coverage factor) is alsooften used even if the distribution is not Gaussian\[reference Section 3.2\], but then the interpretation of95% confidence no longer applies. Three standarddeviations or some other multiple may be used if sospecified. A1-5 The probability distribution and expectationvalue for the position of an edge within the line edgebounding box are determined as described in ANSIZ540-2 \[reference Section 3.2\]. Default values for theseassume the edge is equally likely to be anywhere insidethe line edge bounding box. In that case the expectationvalue of the line edge location is the center of the lineedge bounding box (i.e., the linewidth is the width ofthe mean linewidth bounding box \[Section 5.8.3\]), andthe edge position uncertainty (at the 95% confidencelevel) is 0.577  width of line edge bounding box. Thecorresponding linewidth measurement uncertainty(Section 5.8.7) component is 0.816  width of line edgebounding box if the right and left edge locationuncertainties are uncorrelated, and 1.154  width of lineedge bounding box if they are mirror-image correlated (as is often approximately the case). See referenceSection 3.2, page 13. A1-6 In most cases, the width or centroid or edgepositions of the bounding box is measured from itsimage in a metrology tool; inferring the width of thebounding box from this image usually requiresmodeling of the image-forming process. The boundingbox should be constructed so that its image in themetrology tool can be modeled with the modeling toolsavailable. If the image is not modeled accurately,additional measurement uncertainty will accrue\[reference Section 6.4\].

SEMI P36-0600 © SEMI 20005 APPENDIX 1NOTES NOTE: The material in this appendix is an official part ofSEMI P36 and was approved by full letter ballot procedureson March 1, 2000 by the Japanese Regional StandardsCommittee.A1-1 Reference patterns for adjusting CD-SEMmagnification using their pitches and reference patternsfor optimizing pattern-edge determination parametersusing their widthsA1-2 The following procedures are generally appliedto critical dimension measurements using CD-SEMs: anelectron beam linearly scans across the measuredpattern, secondary and/or reflected electrons emittedfrom every electron-beam incident point are collectedto form its intensity profile, pattern edges aredetermined on the intensity profile using a designatedpattern-edge determination method, and the measure-ment value of the width of the pattern is obtained fromthe distance between the two pattern edges.A1-3 Therefore, measurement errors of CD-SEMmeasurements can be partitioned into two components:one is magnification error and another is pattern-edgedetermination error. Magnification error is caused byvariation of the equipment conditions such as thesampling pitch and incident angle of electron beam.Pattern-edge determination error is affected by themanner of measurement such as pattern-edgedetermination algorithm used and pattern-edgedetermination parameters used, and the properties of thespecimen such as pattern topography (e.g., pattern-edgeslope) and pattern material.A1-4 Magnification error, including inter-machinemagnification error, can be detected and correctedthrough measuring pitches of reference patterns, andpattern-edge determination error could be detected andcorrected through measuring widths of the referencepatterns practical reference patterns are available formeasuring their widths. However, it seems extremelydifficult to produce practical reference patterns formeasuring their widths; the source of the problem liesin the physics of electron beam image formation andnot because the reference patterns are somehowinadequate because of the following reasons: (a)reference pattern can not be determined uniquely, sinceintensity profiles obtained are different from each otherdependent on pattern topography and pattern materialseven if the width of every reference pattern is the same,(b) it is technologically difficult to solve the problem ofwidth change due to the contamination which changesthe measurement value of pattern width dependent onmeasurement time.

SEMI P39-0304E2 © SEMI 20041 SEMI P39-0304 E2 OASISTM  OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD This standard was technically approved by the Global Micropatterning Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Microlithography Committee. Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on July 12, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org December2003; to be published March 2004.E This document was modified in April 2004 to correct editorial errors. Changes were made to Sections 29.8and 36.2. This document was also editorially modified in July 2004 to correct editorial errors. Changes weremade to Section 36. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this specification is to define aninterchange and encapsulation format for hierarchicalintegrated circuit mask layout information.1.2 Background  In the fall of 2001, SEMIs DataPath Task Force formed a working group to define asuccessor to the venerable GDSII Stream format, whichhad served the I.C. industry as a de facto standard forlayout interchange for more than two decades. The oldformat, limited by 16-bit and 32-bit internal integerfields, by its inefficient representation of cell-nativegeometric figures, and by high structural overhead, wasbecoming difficult to use for leading-edge designs, andfile sizes were becoming unwieldy, in some casesgrowing to many tens of gigabytes. The successorformat was chartered with several overall goals: Achieve at least an order-of-magnitude file sizeimprovement compared to GDSII Stream. Remove all 16-bit and 32-bit integer widthrestrictionsmake the new format fully 64-bitcapable. Efficiently represent cells with large payloads offlat native geometric figures. Provide a richer information palette to facilitateinterchange of layout-related information betweendesign and manufacturing.1.2.1 In the months leading up to the formation of theSEMI Data Path Task Force, International Sematechsponsored a series of meetings focusing on Mask EDAissues. Many of the Task Force participants were alsoinvolved in these Sematech meetings, and carriedforward much useful information from those sessionsinto the definition of this specification. 2 Scope2.1 This format is designed primarily to encapsulatehierarchical mask layout for interchange betweensystems such as EDA software, mask writing tools, andmask inspection/repair tools. 2.2 This format is designed to be both hardware- andsoftware-independent.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Use of extension records such as XNAME,XELEMENT, and XGEOMETRY may impairinteroperability between tools. It is recommended thatthese extensions be used primarily for prototyping, andthat interoperability be maintained through the formalinclusion of extensions to this specification. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 IEEE Standards1 IEEE 754-1985  IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic4.2 ISO Standards2 ISO-646-IRV  US-ASCII Character SetISO-3309  Information technology Telecommunications and information exchangebetween systems  High-level data link control(HDLC) procedures  Frame structure4.3 IETF Standards3 RFC 1951  DEFLATE Compressed Data FormatSpecification version 1.3 1 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, IEEE OperationsCenter, 445 Hoes Lane, P.O.

SEMI P39-0304E2 © SEMI 20043 6 OASIS Basics6.1 An OASIS file is a sequence of bytes divided into records. The length of a record is discernible from itsstructure and is not explicit (in contrast to GDSII Stream, where all record lengths are explicit).6.2 An OASIS file has the following overall syntax (using the modified BNF notation described in Section 36 onpage 27). Individual record types appear in bold uppercase and are described in more detail in following sections. \-&gt; START &#123; CBLOCK | PAD | PROPERTY | | &#125;\* END -&gt; &#123; CELLNAME | TEXTSTRING | LAYERNAME | PROPNAME | PROPSTRING | XNAME &#125; -&gt; &#123; CELL &#123; CBLOCK | PAD | PROPERTY | XYRELATIVE | XYABSOLUTE | &#125;\* &#125; -&gt; &#123; | PLACEMENT | TEXT | XELEMENT &#125; -&gt; &#123; RECTANGLE | POLYGON | PATH | TRAPEZOID | CTRAPEZOID | CIRCLE | XGEOMETRY &#125; 6.3 An OASIS file may represent a complete layout hierarchy, a portion of a layout hierarchy, or multiple layouthierarchies. These interpretations are not intrinsic to the format and are governed by application semantics only.Each OASIS file must be syntactically completeit must begin with and contain at least a STARTand END record.6.4 The element is a sequence of 13 ASCII characters: %SEMI-OASIS where represents the ASCII hexadecimal sequence 0D 0A. It is provided as a recognition signature to makeOASIS files easily identifiable to the UNIX file utility. (The intent of the carriage return and newline is to helpdetect corruption by FTP programs operating in non-binary mode.)6.5 EXCEPTION HANDLING  OASIS processors should treat any deviation from the syntax presented in thisdocument as a fatal error. OASIS readers are not required to implement syntax-check preprocessing in order to beconsidered compliant with this specification. The sequence in which exceptions are detected and reported is entirelyapplication-dependent. In addition, for access requests which do not require the interpretation of the entire file (suchas retrieval of a single cell or a subset of the cells within the file), this specification does not require OASIS readersto exhaustively check the validity of the entire file. 7 Data Constructs7.1 Bytes7.1.1 A byte is a fixed-length 8-bit value. Bit patterns for bytes are shown with the least significant bit (bit 0) on theright.7.2 Integers7.2.1 An unsigned-integer is an N-byte (N &gt; 0) integer value. The low-order byte appears first in the OASISformat. Integer byte length is variable and integers are represented as byte-continuations where the most significantbit of each byte except the last in the chain is a 1; the remaining seven bits in each byte are concatenated to form theactual integer value itself. There are no restrictions on integer byte length (and hence, magnitude). Figure 1Unsigned-Integer Representation
