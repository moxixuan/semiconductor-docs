SEMI MF1810-0304 © SEMI 2003, 20045 RELATED INFORMATION 1SUMMARY OF MULTI LABORATORY ROUND ROBIN TEST NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI MF1810. It was developed as part ofthe development of the document. This related information was approved for publication by full letterballot on December 4, 2004.R1-1 The multilaboratory round robin test was doneover a period of 12 months and included 16laboratories. The test required each laboratory tocomplete 11 diameter scan measurements of sevenwafers. A diameter scan area is equal to the areadefined by a microscope field of view and a lengthequal to the wafer diameter less the edge exclusion.Only one defect classification, OISF, was included inthe count and described with pictures. The sequenceand path of the measurement scans were defined so thatthe comparison of the individual measurements wouldbe possible among data sets. Within the ability of eachlaboratory to align the sample on the microscope stage,the starting point and scan path was held constant.R1-2 The complete repeatability and reproducibilitystudy results are listed in Table R1-1 for the four scanmethod for the parameter, deviation from target, inunits of defects/cm2.

SEMI MF1811-0704 © SEMI 2003, 20041 SEMI MF1811-0704GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITYFUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACEPROFILE DATA This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on March 14, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org May2004; to be published July 2004. Original edition published by ASTM International as ASTM F 1811-97.Last previous edition SEMI MF1811-97(2002).1 Purpose1.1 There is some confusion in the roughness-measurement community concerning the use ofestimators and the calculation of power spectraldensities (PSDs) from discrete data sets. Use of thisguide can eliminate these differences and result in theuse of consistent units for the PSD and relatedparameters. It also provides a uniform reportingprocedure for digital roughness data that can facilitatecommunication between different workers and differentlaboratories.2 Scope2.1 This guide defines the methodology for calculatinga set of commonly used statistical parameters andfunctions of surface roughness from a set of measuredsurface profile data. Its purposes are to providefundamental procedures and notation for processing andpresenting data, to alert the reader to related issues thatmay arise in user-specific applications, and to provideliterature references where further details can be found.2.2 This guide is limited to the analysis of one-dimensional or profile data taken at uniform intervalsalong straight lines across the surface under test,although reference is made to the more general case oftwo-dimensional measurements made over arectangular array of data points.2.3 The data analysis procedures described in thisguide are generic and are not limited to specificsurfaces, surface-generation techniques, degrees ofroughness, or measuring techniques. Examples ofmeasuring techniques that can be used to generateprofile data for analysis are mechanical profilinginstruments using a rigid contacting probe, opticalprofiling instruments that sample over a line or an arrayover an area of the surface, optical interferometry, andscanning-microscopy techniques such as atomic-forcemicroscopy. The distinctions between differentmeasuring techniques enter this guide through variousparameters and functions that are defined in Sections 4and 5, such as their sampling intervals, bandwidths, andmeasurement transfer functions. 2.4 The primary interest here is the characterization ofrandom or periodic aspects of surface finish rather thanisolated surface defects such as pits, protrusions,scratches or ridges. Although the methods of dataanalysis described here can be equally well applied toprofile data of isolated surface features, the parametersand functions that are derived using the proceduresdescribed in this guide may have a different physicalsignificance than those derived from random orperiodic surfaces.2.5 The statistical parameters and functions that arediscussed in this guide are, in fact, mathematicalabstractions that are generally defined in terms of aninfinitely-long linear profile across the surface, or theensemble average of an infinite number of finite-length profiles. In contrast, real profile data areavailable in the form of one or more sets of digitizedheight data measured at a finite number of discretepositions on the surface under test. This guide givesboth the abstract definitions of the statistical quantitiesof interest, and numerical procedures for determiningvalues of these abstract quantities from sets ofmeasured data. In the notation of this guide thesenumerical procedures are called estimators and theresults that they produce are called estimates.2.6 This guide gives periodogram estimators fordetermining the root-mean-square (rms) roughness, rmsslope, and power spectral density (PSD) of the surfacedirectly from profile height or slope measurements.The statistical literature uses a circumflex to distinguishan estimator or estimate from its abstract or ensemble-average value. For example,  denotes an estimate ofthe quality A. However, some word-processors cannotplace a circumflex over consonants in text. Anysymbolic or verbal device may be used instead.2.7 The quality of estimators of surface statistics are, inturn, characterized by higher-order statistical propertiesthat describe their bias and fluctuation propertieswith respect to their abstract or ensemble-averageversions. This guide does not discuss the higher-orderstatistical properties of the estimators given here sincetheir practical significance and use are application-specific and beyond the scope of this document.

&lt;!-- Page 5 --&gt;

SEMI MF1811-0704 © SEMI 2003, 2004 2 Details of these and related subjects can be found in thereferences listed in Section 7.2.8 Raw measured profile data generally containtrending components that are independent of themicrotopography of the surface being measured. Thesecomponents must be subtracted before the difference orresidual errors are subjected to the statistical-estimationroutines given here. These trending componentsoriginate from both extrinsic and intrinsic sources.Extrinsic trends arise from the rigid-body positioning ofthe part under test in the measuring apparatus. In opticsthese displacement and rotation contributions are calledpiston and tilt errors. In contrast, intrinsic trendsarise from deliberate or accidental shape errors inherentin the surface under test, such as a circular or paraboliccurvature. In the absence of a-priori information aboutthe true surface shape, the intrinsic shape error isfrequently limited to a quadratic (parabolic) curvatureof the surface. Detrending of intrinsic and extrinsictrends is generally accomplished simultaneously bysubtracting a detrending polynomial from the rawmeasured data, where the polynomial coefficients aredetermined by least-squares fitting to the measureddata.2.9 Although surfaces and surface measuringinstruments exist in real or configuration space, they aremost easily understood in frequency space, also knownas Fourier transform, reciprocal or spatial-frequencyspace. This is because any practical measurementprocess can be considered to be a linear system,meaning that the measured profile is the convolution ofthe true surface profile and the impulse response of themeasuring system; and equivalently, the Fourier-amplitude spectrum of the measured profile is theproduct of that of the true profile and the frequency-dependent transfer function of the measurementsystem. This is expressed symbolically by thefollowing equation:)()()( xxtruexmeas fTfAfA = (1) where:A = the Fourier amplitudes,T(fx) = instrument response function or the measure-ment transfer function, andfx = surface spatial frequency.This factorization permits the surface and the mea-suring system to be discussed independently of eachother in frequency space, and is an essential feature ofany discussion of measurement systems.2.10 Figure 1 sketches different forms of themeasurement transfer function, T(fx): 2.10.1 Case (a) is a perfect measuring system, whichhas T ( fx) = 1 for all spatial frequencies, 0 ≤ fx ≤ .This is unrealistic since no real measuring instrument isequally sensitive to all spatial frequencies.2.10.2 Case (b) is an ideal measuring system, whichhas T (fx) = 1 for LFL ≤ fx ≤ HFL and T(fx) = 0otherwise, where LFL and HFL denote the low-frequency and high-frequency limits of themeasurement. The range LFL ≤ fx ≤ HFL is called thebandpass or bandwidth of the measurement, and ratioHFL/LFL is called the dynamic range of themeasurement.2.10.3 Case (c) represents a realistic measuring system,since it includes the fact that T (fx) need not be unitywithin the measurement bandpass or strictly zerooutside the bandpass.2.11 If the measurement transfer function is known todeviate significantly from unity within the measurementbandpass, the measured power spectral density (PSD)can be transformed into the form that would have beenmeasured by an instrument with the ideal rectangularform through the process of digital restoration. In itssimplest form restoration involves dividing themeasured PSD by the known form of | |T( )fx 2 over themeasurement bandpass. Restoration is particularlyrelevant to measuring instruments that involve opticalmicroscopes since the transfer functions of microscopesystems are not unity over their bandpass but tend tofall linearly between unity at T (0) = 1 and T(HFL) = 0.The need for, and methodology of digital restoration isinstrument specific and this guide places norequirements on its use.2.12 This guide requires that any data on surface finishparameters or functions generated by the proceduresdescribed herein be accompanied by an identifyingdescription of measuring instrument used, estimates ofits low- and high-frequency limits, LFL and HFL, and astatement of whether or not restoration techniques wereused.2.13 In order to make a quantitative comparisonbetween profile data obtained from differentmeasurement techniques, the statistical parameters andfunctions of interest must be compared over the same orcomparable spatial-frequency regions. The mostcommon quantities used to compare surfaces are theirroot-mean-square (rms) roughness values, which are thesquare roots of the areas under the PSD betweenspecified surface-frequency limits. Surface statisticsderived from measurements involving different spatial-frequency ranges cannot be compared quantitativelyexcept in an approximate way. In some casesmeasurements with partially or even nonoverlappingbandwidths can be compared by using analytic models

&lt;!-- Page 6 --&gt;

SEMI MF1811-0704 © SEMI 2003, 20043 of the PSDs to extrapolate the PSDs outside theirmeasurement bandwidth.2.14 Examples of specific band-width limits can bedrawn from the optical and semiconductor industries.In optics the so-called total integrated scatter or TISmeasurement technique leads to rms roughness valuesinvolving an annulus in two-dimensional spatialfrequencies space from 0.069 to 1.48 m1; that is, adynamic range of 1.48/0.069 = 21/1. In contrast, therange of spatial frequencies involved in optical andmechanical scanning techniques are generally muchlarger than this, frequently having a dynamic ranges of512/1 or more. In the latter case the subrange of 0.0125to 1 m1 has been used to discuss the rms surfaceroughness in the semiconductor industry. Thesenumbers are provided to illustrate the magnitudes andranges of HFL and LFL encountered in practice but donot constitute a recommendation of particular limits forthe specification of surface finish parameters. Suchselections are application dependent, and are to bemade at the users' discretion.2.15 The limits of integration involved in thedetermination of rms roughness and slope values frommeasured profile data are introduced by multiplying themeasured PSD by a factor equal to zero for spatialfrequencies outside the desired bandpass and unitywithin the desired bandpass, as shown in Case (b) inFigure 1. This is called a top-hat or binary filterfunction. Before the ready availability of digitalfrequency-domain processing as employed in thisguide, bandwidth limits were imposed by passing theprofile data through analog or digital filters withoutexplicitly transforming them into the frequency domainand multiplying by a top-hat function. The twoprocesses are mathematically equivalent, providing thedata filter has the desired frequency response. Realdata filters, however, frequently have Gaussian or RCforms that only approximate the desired top-hat formthat introduces some ambiguity in their interpretation.This guide recommends the determination of rmsroughness and slope values using top-hat windowing ofthe measured PSD in the frequency domain.2.16 The PSD and rms roughness are surface statisticsof particular interest to the optics and semiconductorindustries because of their direct relationship to thefunctional properties of such surfaces. In the case ofrougher surfaces these are still valid and usefulstatistics, although the functional properties of suchsurfaces may depend on additional statistics as well.The ASME Standard on Surface Texture, B46.1,discusses additional surface statistics, terms, andmeasurement methods applicable to machined surfaces.2.17 The units used in this guide are a self-consistentset of SI units that are appropriate for many measurements in the semiconductor and optics industry.This guide does not mandate the use of these units, butdoes require that results expressed in other units bereferenced to SI units for ease of comparison.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI ME1392  Practice for Angle Resolved OpticalScatter Measurements on Specular or Diffuse SurfacesSEMI MF1048  Test Method for Measuring theEffective Surface Roughness of Optical Components byTotal Integrated Scattering3.2 ASTM StandardE 284  Terminology Relating to Appearance ofMaterials1 3.3 ANSI StandardANSI/ASME B46.1  Surface Texture (SurfaceRoughness, Waviness and Lay) 2 NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 4 Terminology4.1 Introduction  This section provides thedefinitions of special terms used in this guide, andincludes the mathematical definitions of differentprofile statistics in terms of continuous, infinitely-longprofiles.

Again,the averaged quantities must include the same range ofsurface spatial frequencies.4.2.3 bandwidth, bandwidth limits  range of surfacespatial frequencies included in a measurement orspecification.4.2.3.1 Discussion  Bandwidth is specified by ahigh-frequency limit (HFL) and a low-frequency limit(LFL). The bandwidth and the measurement transferfunction over the bandwidth must be taken into accountwhen measurements or statistical properties arecompared. Different measuring instruments aregenerally sensitive to different ranges of surface spatialfrequencies; that is, they have different bandwidthlimits. Real bandwidth limits are necessarily finitesince no measuring instrument is sensitive to infinitely-low or to infinitely-high surface spatial frequencies.4.2.4 bias error  average deviation between anestimate of a statistical quantity and its true value.4.2.4.1 Discussion  The periodogram estimator ofthe power spectral density (PSD) given in this guide is azero-bias or unbiased estimator of the PSD. On theother hand, local averaging of the periodogram canintroduce bias errors in regions where the spectrumvaries rapidly with frequency.4.2.5 deterministic profile  surface profile that is aknown function of surface position, with no randomdependencies on position.4.2.5.1 Discussion  In contrast, a random profile isknown only in terms of a probability distributionfunction.4.2.6 detrended profile, Zd(x)  the raw or measuredprofile after removing instrumental and surface trends.The detrended profile is the input for the statisticalestimation routines described in Section 5.4.2.6.1 Discussion  If the parametric form of thetrend is known, its least-squares-fitted form can besubtracted from the measured profile data. Otherwise a generic power-series form can be used. This guidedescribes the procedures for removing a zero-, first- orsecond-order polynomial in the trace distance. A zero-order polynomial removes piston; a first-orderpolynomial removes piston and tilt; and a second-orderpolynomial removes piston, tilt and quadratic curvature.In each case the detrended data set has zero mean. Thecoefficients of constant and linear terms correspond tothe rigid-body orientation of the part being measuredand need not be recorded. However, the coefficient ofthe quadratic term represents the intrinsic curvature ofthe surface being measured and should be recorded.4.2.7 dynamic range  ratio of the high- to low-frequency limits of the bandwidth of a givenmeasurement technique.4.2.7.1 Discussion  The ratio HFL/LFL is a usefulsingle-number characteristic of a measuring apparatus.It completely describes the measurement effects onsurfaces with power-law power spectra.4.2.8 ensemble  infinitely large collection (infiniteensemble) of quantities, the properties of which aregoverned by some statistical distribution law.4.2.8.1 Discussion  For example, ensembles includesurface profiles, and rms roughness values.4.2.9 ensemble average value  value of a particularsurface parameter or function averaged over theappropriate distribution functions.4.2.9.1 Discussion  The ensemble average value ofthe quantity A is denoted by . Estimates ofensemble-average quantities based on a finite collectionof measurements (finite ensemble) can deviate fromtheir infinite-ensemble values by fluctuation and biaserrors.4.2.10 estimate  ensemble-average value of aroughness statistic from a finite set of measured profiledata.4.2.10.1 Discussion  In this guide, a circumflex isused to distinguish estimates from the correspondingensemble-average quantities (see also Section 2.6).4.2.11 estimator  algorithm or mathematicalprocedure for calculating an estimate.4.2.12 fast fourier transform or FFT  algorithm forcalculating the Fourier transform (discrete Fouriertransform or DFT) of a set of numerical data.4.2.12.1 Discussion  The discovery of the FFT isgenerally attributed to Cooley and Tukey, although itwas used and reported in the earlier literature by anumber of others, including Gauss, two centuriesbefore. It is now ubiquitous and can be found in any

SEMI MF1811-0704 © SEMI 2003, 20045 computer data analysis package (see Section 5.4.2 fordetails).4.2.13 finish parameters and functions  numbers orfunctions that characterize surface height fluctuations.4.2.13.1 Discussion  The values and forms of finishparameters and functions may vary depending on thebandwidth of surface frequencies that they contain, andthe shapes of the transfer functions of the measurementinstruments involved. These quantities are representedby their ensemble-average values derived frommeasurements using specific estimation routines. Ingeneral, the finish parameters and functions of an areaare different from those of profiles taken across thesurface. In the case of surfaces that are statisticallyisotropic, however, the area and profile statistics have aone-to-one relationship. Except for incidental remarks,this guide is concerned exclusively with the propertiesof surface profiles.4.2.14 fluctuation error  general term denoting thedeviation of a quantity from its mean, average ordetrended value.4.2.14.1 Discussion  Fluctuation errors are usuallymeasured in terms of their mean-square or rms values.For example, Rq is the rms fluctuation error in thesurface height and q is the rms fluctuation error in theprofile slope. In turn, the estimates of Rq and q havetheir own fluctuation errors. The magnitudes of thesehigher fluctuation errors not discussed in this guide.4.2.15 high-frequency limit (HFL) \[1/m\]  highestspatial frequency contained in a profile data set orspecification.4.2.15.1 Discussion  The HFL of a measurement isdetermined by the details of the measurement process,and its value in specifications is determined by the user.If the sampling interval in the measurement process isD, the extreme value of the HFL is given by theNyquist criterion, HFL = 1/(2D). However, otherelectrical, mechanical, or optical filtering mechanismsmay further limit the HFL. Examples of suchmechanisms are the stylus tip radius, projectedmeasurement pixel size, optical resolution, andelectrical and digital filters, all of which contribute tothe high-frequency roll-off of the instrument transferfunction. If the Nyquist frequency is used to determinethe HFL, care should be taken to determine that the trueHFL is not reduced by these additional mechanisms.4.2.16 intrinsic surface or finish parameters characteristics such as the rms roughness or rms slopethat contain all surface spatial frequencies from zero toinfinity. 4.2.16.1 Discussion  Intrinsic parameters arestatistical abstractions that cannot be measured orestimated directly since real measurements are sensitiveto only limited ranges of surface spatial frequencies.They can, however, be inferred from real measurementsby augmenting measurements with a-priori informationabout very low and very high spatial frequenciescontained in physically-based models of the PSDs ofthe surfaces involved. All measured finish parametersare finite, but their corresponding intrinsic values neednot be. The important distinction between intrinsic andmeasured (band-width limited) finish parameters is notalways made in the literature.4.2.17 impulse response, of a profile measuring system measured shape of an impulse or infinitely-sharpridge lying perpendicularly to the profile direction.4.2.17.1 Discussion  In the case of a linearmeasuring system the impulse response is the Fouriertransform of the system transfer function. The impulseresponse of a perfect measuring system would be aninfinitely sharp spike or delta function. In contrast, theimpulse response of real measuring systems has a finitewidth.4.2.18 isotropic surface  surface whose intrinsicfinish parameters and functions are independent of therotational position of the surface about its surfacenormal. Also known as statistically-isotropic surface.4.2.18.1 Discussion  The rms roughness of profilestaken across an isotropically rough surface isindependent of the profile directions, and equals therms roughness of the surface area. The rms slope of anisotropically rough surface is also independent of theprofile direction and equals 1/2 of the rms areagradient. The one-dimensional or profile power spec-trum of an isotropic surface is also independent of thedirection of the profile on the surface, and is related tothe two-dimensional spectrum of the surface area by anintegral transform. Examples of this are given inSection 4.2.41.4.2.19 linear systems, linear measurement system  asignal-processing concept more precisely described as alinear, shift-invariant system.4.2.19.1 Discussion  For the present purposes, alinear measurement of the surface profile is the trueprofile convolved with the impulse response of themeasuring system, or equivalently, the Fourieramplitude spectrum of the measurement is the trueamplitude spectrum times the measurement transferfunction as indicated in Section 2.9. All practicalmeasurement systems are taken to be linear over theiroperating ranges.

SEMI MF1811-0704 © SEMI 2003, 2004 6 4.2.20 low-frequency limit (LFL) \[1/m\]  lowestspatial frequency contained in a profile data set orspecification.4.2.20.1 Discussion  The minimum LFL in a profilemeasurement is the reciprocal of the length of thesurface profile. The estimated value of the PSD at thisvalue of the LFL is generally attenuated by thedetrending process. To avoid this effect the lowestpractical LFL is sometimes taken to be 3 to 5 times thereciprocal of the scan length. The LFL in surfacespecifications is determined by the user.4.2.21 mean-square profile roughness, R q2 \[nm2\] ensemble-average value of the square of the height ofthe detrended profile.4.2.21.1 Discussion  This value is given by thefollowing relationship: ( ) ++  ==012/ 2/22 d)(d)(1Lim xxL LdLq ffSxxZLR (2) where:Z d (x) = detrended surface profile, andS1(fx) = its power spectral density.The intrinsic value of the mean-square roughness of anisotropically-rough surface area equals the mean-squareroughness of any profile across it. The rms roughness,R q, is distinct from the arithmetic-average roughness,Ra . The two are only related through a specific height-distribution function. For example, for a Gaussianheight distribution, qqa RRR 798.02 == (3) Note that the optics literature uses the symbol  for Rq.4.2.22 mean-square profile slope, q2 \[units of choice\] average value of the square of the slope of thedetrended profile.4.2.22.1 Discussion  This expression, given by ++  ==0122/ 2/ 22 d)()2(ddd1Lim xxxL LdLq ffSfxxzL (4) assumes that the average slope has been removed in thedetrending process. The integrand in the frequencyintegral on the right can be viewed as the slope powerspectral density. The mean-square surface slope of anisotropically-rough two-dimensional surface is half themean-square gradient of the surface itself.4.2.23 measured profile parameters and functions quantities derived from detrended profile data that include the bandwidth and transfer function effects ofthe particular measurement system used.4.2.23.1 Discussion  Measured profile parametersand functions can be used for comparing surfacesquality providing the same measurement system is usedin all cases. In order to compare quantitativemeasurements made by different measurement systems,or to estimate intrinsic surface properties, the systembandwidths and transfer functions must be taken intoaccount. In the early literature, measurement systemswere taken to be perfect in the sense of Section2.10.1, and the effects of their bandwidths and transferfunctions were ignored.4.2.24 Nyquist frequency \[1/m\]  spatial frequencyequal to the reciprocal of twice the sampling interval.See Section 4.2.15.1.4.2.24.1 Discussion  The Nyquist frequencyrepresents the highest undistorted frequency involved ina series of uniformly-spaced profile measurements.Higher-frequency components in the surface appear atlower-frequencies through the process of aliasing.Unless the effects of aliasing are removed by anti-aliasing mechanisms in the measurement process, theycorrupt the measured spectrum immediately below theNyquist frequency. In that case the HFL should betaken to be a factor of 3 to 5 below the Nyquistfrequency.4.2.25 periodic random roughness  modified versionof purely periodic roughness that has a definitefundamental spatial frequency, but random variations inits phase or amplitude (see Section 4.2.26).4.2.26 periodic roughness  roughness with a definitefundamental spatial frequency.4.2.26.1 Discussion  The power spectra of periodicand periodic random roughness appear as isolated peaksin the power spectral density function. This pattern isdistinct from the broad variations appearing for purelyrandom surfaces. Random surfaces can be viewed asperiodic surfaces with a broad distribution of funda-mental periods.4.2.27 periodogram estimate  estimates of particularfinish parameters that are derived from the periodogramestimator for the power spectrum.4.2.28 periodogram estimator  a particular estimatorfor the power spectral density that is proportional to thesquare magnitude of the discrete Fourier transform ofthe detrended data set.4.2.28.1.1 Discussion  The periodogram is theestimator for the PSD that is used in this guide. Thesignal-processing literature contains many differentestimators of the power spectrum in addition to the

In general, they differ from theperiodogram in that they incorporate different types anddegrees of a-priori physical or mathematicalinformation about the original data set. Theperiodogram, in contrast, includes the maximumnumber of degrees of freedom and is always used forfirst-cut evaluation and analysis. Details of thecorrelation and other spectral estimation methods arediscussed in the literature listed in Section 7. Amathematical variant of the periodogram estimator isthe correlation method. This is a two-step process thatrequires the estimation of an intermediate function, theautocovariance function, which is then Fouriertransformed to obtain the periodogram estimate of thepower spectrum. This method is not discussed in thisguide since it is indirect, but when properly appliedgives identically the same results as the direct transformmethod recommended in this guide.4.2.29 power spectral density (PSD)  statisticalfunction that shows how the mean-square (rms)2 of agiven quantity is distributed among the various surfacespatial frequencies inherent in the profile height. Alsoknown as power spectrum.4.2.29.1 Discussion  The two conventional measuresof surface roughness, Ra and Rq do not carry anyinformation about the transverse scale of the surfaceroughness. That is, they are independent of how muchthe surface profile is squeezed or stretched parallel tothe surface plane. The PSD is the simplest statistic thatcarries that important additional information.4.2.29.2 profile or one-dimensional PSD of the surfaceheight, \[m3 \]  a function of the spatial frequency, fx,in units of inverse micrometers, m 1, defined asfollows: 0,d)(2Lim)( 22/ 2/21 &gt;  = +  xL LxfiLx fxexZLfS x (5) 4.2.29.2.1 Discussion  The subscript x on fxcorresponds to the direction of the profile on the surfaceand can be omitted if no confusion is involved. In thisdefinition the spatial frequency, fx, is always positiveand greater than zero. The value at fx = 0 correspondsto the average value of the profile height, which is zerofor detrended profiles. The factor of 2 accounts for theequal contribution from negative frequencies and en-sures that the area under the positive-frequency profilespectrum equals the rms-squared (mean-square) profileheight.4.2.29.3 area or two-dimensional PSD of the surfaceheight \[m4 \]  a function of the spatial frequencies inboth the x and y directions on the surface, fx and fy, inunits of inverse micrometers, m1, defined as follows: ( )&#123; &#125; ,dd2exp),(1Lim),( 22  +=  yxyfxfiyxZAffS A yxAyx+&lt;&lt; yx ff , (6) 4.2.29.3.1 Discussion  The spatial frequency rangesincluded in this definition cover the entire frequencyplane and are not limited to positive frequencies only asin the case of the profile spectrum. In the case of anisotropically rough surface the area spectrum is afunction only of the magnitude of the two-dimensionalfrequency vector: f = (f x2 + fy2). The profile spectrumcan be derived from the area spectrum, but the areaspectrum cannot, in general, be derived from the profilespectrum. Uniaxial and isotropically rough surfaces areexceptions.4.2.29.4 Discussion of Units: The surface heightfluctuations of optical surfaces are usually measured inunits of nanometers (1 nm = 10 3 m), or the non-SIunits of ngstroms (1  = 10 4 m). Values of thePSDs estimated using height data in these units can beconverted to the recommended units by multiplying bythe following conversion factors: To convert S1 in units of nm2 m to units of m3multiply it by 106, To convert S1 in units of 2m to units of m3multiply it by 108 , To convert S2 in units of nm2m2 to units of m4multiply it by 106, and To convert S2 in units of 2m2 to units of m4multiply it by 108.If the sample interval is given in millimeters instead ofmicrometers, the conversion factors for S1 should bemultiplied by an additional factor of 10 3, and those forS 2 should be multiplied by an additional factor of 106. 4.2.30 radius of curvature, xR)  radius of a circlefitted to the measured surface profile.4.2.30.1 Discussion  When the radius us largerelative to the profile length its magnitude is mosteasily determined from the quadratic term in thedetrending polynomial. If the average surface profile iswritten as Z(x) = a + bx + cx 2, the estimate of the radiusof curvature in the x direction is ).2/(1 cR x =) If Z and xare expressed in micrometers, xR) is in micrometers.Since the radii of curvature of nominally flat surfacescan be quite large, other reporting units, such as metersor kilometers, may be more appropriate.4.2.31 random surface profile  surface height profilethat involves parameters that are distributed accordingto statistical distribution laws rather than having fixed

Also known as randomroughness.4.2.31.1 Discussion  For example, the profile)2cos()( += xfAxZ x (7) is deterministic if  = const., but random if  has afinite-width probability distribution function P(). Fin-ish parameters and functions such as Z(x) 2 , are then thevalues of those quantities averaged over P().4.2.32 restoration  signal-processing procedure inwhich measurements are compensated for a non-unitmeasurement transfer function by passing them througha digital filter that restores the effective measurementfunction to unity over its bandpass.4.2.32.1 Discussion  The measured profile can berestored and the statistics of the restored profile canthen be estimated. The most common spatial- andfrequency-domain filters used for this purpose areinverse and Wiener filters. This guide does notdiscuss the details of such restoration processes, whichmay be found in standard signal-processing texts suchas those listed in Section 7.4.2.33 RMS profile roughness, R q, \[nm\]  square rootof the mean-square profile roughness.4.2.34 RMS profile slope, q  square root of themean-square profile slope.4.2.34.1 Discussion  The slope is dimensionless,although the fundamental unit is the radian. In practiceit may be convenient to express the rms slope of highlypolished surfaces in microradians.4.2.35 sample interval, D, \[m\]  distance betweenadjacent measurements of the surface height along the xaxis. Also known as sampling interval.4.2.35.1 Discussion  The sample interval is usuallychosen or recommended by the manufacturer of theprofile instrument being used. The sample intervaldefines the Nyquist frequency and hence, the extremeHFL of the measurement. This guide does not addressmeasurements with unequal sample intervals or thosemade along nonlinear traces over the surface.4.2.36 sampled profile, Z(xn ), \[nm\]  surface height,Z(xn ), measured at N equally-spaced points along the xaxis.4.2.36.1 Discussion  This guide uses the followingindexing convention for the position of the heightsamples,NnDnx n ,,2,1,)1( L== (8) Therefore the distance between the first and last pointsin the profile trace is (N  1)D. 4.2.37 sampled slope, m(xn)  surface slope, m(xn),measured at N equally-spaced points along the x axisusing the same indexing convention as for the sampledprofile.4.2.37.1 Discussion  Some instruments measure thesurface slope directly, while others, in effect, measurethe surface height at N + 1 points and generate N slopevalues using the equation: \[ \] NnxZxZDxm nnn ,,2,1,)()(1)( 1 L== + (9) 4.2.38 slope power spectrum, S (fx \[m\]  statisticalfunction that shows how the mean-square profile slopeis distributed over surface spatial frequencies asfollows: ( ) )()2(d2exp)(1Lim)( 1222/ 2/1 xxL LxLx fSfxxfixmLfS =     = +  (10)4.2.38.1 Discussion  This simple connectionbetween the slope and roughness power spectra permitsone to be determined immediately in terms of the other.The prime on S1, on the left denotes that this is the PSDof the slope, while the unprimed S1 on the far right isthe PSD of the height.4.2.39 spatial frequency, fx ,\[1/m\]  frequencyparameter in the Fourier transform of the surface profileZ(x).4.2.39.1 Discussion  The parameter f x is related tothe spatial wavelength, dx through fx = 1/dx.

Thismodel is sometimes called the K-correlation model, andthe quantity B/(2), the correlation length.4.2.41.3 Another example of a spectral model is thefractal model, which has the following form for theprofile PSD: Cxx fKfS 11 )( = (13) and for the two-dimensional spectrum of anisotropically-rough surface: 122 )( += CfKfS (14) where: .)2/(2/)1(21 12 KCCK += The finish parameters in this model are K1 and C, whichhave the dimensions of m(3C) and m0. Thedimensionless number C usually lies between 1 and 3but need not be an integer. The quantity KC issometimes referred to as the spectral strength, and theparameter, C, the spectral index.4.2.41.4 The fractal model is the limiting case of theABC model when the finish parameter B becomes verylarge. The value of the intrinsic mean-square profileand area roughness of the ABC model, obtained byintegrating the ABC spectrum over all frequencies, is asfollows: 2200 1212d)(2d)( BACffSfffSR xxq===  (15) which is finite for C &gt; 1. The intrinsic value of themean-square roughness of the fractal model is alwaysinfinite because of its divergence at low spatialfrequencies. In contrast, the measured roughnessvalues, obtained by integrating only over the measure-ment bandpass, are finite for the ABC model for anyvalue of C, and for the fractal model.4.2.41.5 A third example of a spectral model is theperiodic model, which is for a surface consisting of aperiodic structure and has the following forms for theprofile PSD: = = =k kxkx dkfAfS1 021 21)( (16) and for the two-dimensional spectrum: += = =k kyxkyx fdkfAffS )(41),(02||2 (17) where the k = 0 is excluded.

The basicperiodicity of that expansion is ND rather than theliteral profile length L = (N1)D. Depending on thetype of FFT used in the practical evaluation of the PSD,N may be required to be a power of 2, such as 1024,although in general, there is no restriction on N in thisguide.4.2.43 transfer function  function of spatialfrequency having a magnitude between zero and onewhich describes the sensitivity of a linear measuringsystem to the amplitudes of different spatial-frequencycomponents in the profile being measured. Also knownas measurement transfer function.4.2.43.1 Discussion  The ideal transfer function isunity within the measurement bandpass and zero forfrequencies outside the bandpass. Real-worldmeasurement transfer functions can deviatesignificantly from this. The transfer function is theFourier transform of the impulse response function ofthe measuring apparatus.4.2.44 uniaxial surface  surface whose roughness isconfined to a particular direction or lay, so that it can becompletely characterized by profile measurementsperpendicular to the lay direction. Surfaces that displayharmonic lines are frequently uniaxial. Also known asgrating-like surface.4.2.44.1 Discussion  In contrast, an isotropic surfacecan also be completely characterized by profilemeasurements made in one direction, but there is nopreferred direction as there is for uniaxial surfaces.Surfaces that are neither uniaxial nor isotropic can becharacterized using the procedures described in thisguide, although profile measurements taken on manydirections across the surface may be needed to generatea complete statistical description of the surface undertest.4.2.45 window function, W(xn)  bell-shaped orsmooth-edged function that multiplies the detrendedprofile data set before it is inserted into the period-ogram estimation routine. Also known as data window.4.2.45.1 Discussion  The window functionsmoothes out possible discontinuities at the ends ofthe measured, finite-length data set in order to eliminatethe spurious oscillations that those discontinuitieswould otherwise generate in the spectral estimate. As long as the window function performs its function ofreducing the contributions from the ends of the datarecord and has the proper normalization, its shape is ofsecondary importance.4.2.46 zero padding  procedure of adding zerovalues to a data set to bring the total number of datapoints, N, to a power of two to facilitate the evaluationof the FFT appearing in the periodogram spectralestimate.4.2.46.1 Discussion  The window functions shouldbe applied to the data set before zero padding. Zeropadding is less important with the ready availability ofarbitrary- N FFT computing packages. 5 Calculations5.1 Detrending5.1.1 Introduction  The estimators defined in thissection are based on the analysis of a data set Z(n)consisting of N discrete values of the surface profileZ(xn = (n1)D) measured at equally-spaced locationsalong a straight line of length L, where n = 1 to N. IfZ(n) is the measured profile, the detrended profile isgiven by: \]\[)()( 2ncnbanZnZd ++= (20) where the quantity in the square bracket is the quadraticdetrending polynomial. The estimated values of thepolynomial coefficients a, b, and c, denoted by a) , b) ,and c) , respectively, are determined by least-squaresfitting of the polynomial to the measured profile data asnow described. The degree of the detrendingpolynomial is chosen by the following considerations:Removing piston only (zeroth-order polynomial, a) isuseful for instructional purposes but is inadequate inpractice. It affects only the zero-frequency or dc termin the power spectral density. Removing piston and tilt(first-order polynomial, a + bn) is sufficient forremoving uncertainties in the rigid-body positioning ofa nominally flat sample in the measurement apparatus.Removing piston, tilt and curvature (second-orderpolynomial, a + bn + cn2) removes an additionalquadratic term in the profile that may result frominstrumental (extrinsic) effects or true (intrinsic)curvature in the surface being measured.5.1.2 Piston detrending is as follows: anZndZ )) = )()( (21) and 0Ma +=) (22)

For example,the value of the coefficient a) for piston detrending andpiston-plus-tilt detrending derived from the same data set aregenerally different.NOTE 2: Despite these apparent differences, the mean valuesof each of the detrended profiles given by ===N nndZN 10)(1Mean value ) (26) vanishes in all cases. This means that the dc value of theestimated power spectrum of the detrended profile is zero,which offers a convenient numerical check on the numericalprocessing routines used. NOTE 3: Least-squares fitting routines are available in manycomputer packages. Analytic results are given above forreference and checking. 5.2 RMS Roughness5.2.1 There are two different estimators for the rmsroughness, Rq  one expressed in configuration space,and the other in frequency space, as follows: ==N nq ndZNR122 )(1)Config( )) (27) and + ==21 112 )(1)Freq(N mq mSNDR )) (28) 1 where )(1 mS) is the periodogram estimate of the PSDbased on )(ndZ) (see Section 5.4).NOTE 4: These two estimates of R q2 are mathematicallyidentical if the periodogram is evaluated using a unit datawindow, W(n) = 1. Although a unit window function is notrecommended for general use, the numerical identity of theEquation 27 and Equation 28 in that case offers a convenientcheck on the programming of the periodogram estimator.NOTE 5: If a non-unit data window is used in the calculationof the PSD the two estimates of the rms roughness given willnot, in general, be numerically identical for a particular pro-file measurement. On the other hand, the two estimates areidentical for an ensemble average over a large number of pro-file measurements. In other words, the two estimates of R q2are statistically the same.NOTE 6: The first estimator has the advantage of familiarityand simplicity since it is expressed directly in terms of thedetrended values of the measured profile data. Its disad-vantage is that it involves, perforce, the transfer function ofthe measuring apparatus, and in a nonobvious way. In con-trast, the frequency-space form may be more complicated toevaluate but has the advantage that it permits the bandwidth tobe included in the rms value to be varied by selecting therange of m values included in the frequency sum. In addition,it permits the effects of a non-unit instrumental transferfunction within that bandpass to be examined directly, and tobe divided out by restoration processes, if its form is knownindependently.NOTE 7: The spectra of real surfaces frequently tend todiverge at low spatial frequencies so that the values of the rmsroughness obtained using either estimator may depend signi-ficantly on the value of the LFL of the measurement process,or chosen as a reference value. In some cases, the presence ofa non-vanishing LFL can give a finite value of the profileroughness when its intrinsic value is infinite or undefined.

SEMI MF1811-0704 © SEMI 2003, 2004 12 5.3 RMS Slope5.3.1 There are two different estimators for the rmsslope, q  one expressed in configuration space, andthe other in frequency space, as follows:  =+=1 122 )()1(\[1)Config(N nq ndZndZND))) (29) and2)2/(1 112 )1(2)(1)Freq(  = + = NDmmSNDN mq)) (30) NOTE 8: The magnitudes of these two estimates aregenerally different since the first treats the profile as acollection of straight-line segments connecting themeasurement points, while the second connects them with abandwidth-limited interpolation curve and involves a smallerbias error.NOTE 9: The notes for the rms roughness estimators justmade generally apply to slope estimates as well. Onedifference is that the significant bandwidth effects on theslope occur principally at the HFL rather than the LFL as isthe case for rms roughness measurements. 5.4 Periodogram Estimators of the Profile PowerSpectral Density5.4.1 Form for 1-dimensional Power Spectral Densityfor height-measuring profilometers is as follows: .)()(FFT2)(21 NmKmDmS =) (31) The spatial frequency is evaluated at the discretevaluesof m, with m = 1, 2,  , \[1 + (N/2)\]: .1NDmf x= (32) 5.4.2 The symbol FFT in Equation 31 stands fordiscrete Fourier transform, which is always evaluatedusing some version of the fast Fourier transform asfollows: ==N nndZnWNmnim1)()(\]/)1)(1(2exp\[)(FFT ) (33) where:W(n) = window function (see Section 5.6) andK(m) = book-keeping factor equal to  for m = 1 orm = 1 + (N/2) and equal to 1 otherwise.NOTE 10: Equation 33 applies for the conventional case ofeven N. Different forms apply for odd N. NOTE 11: The case m = 1 corresponds to the zero-frequencyor dc component of the detrended surface profile and m = 2corresponds to the spatial frequency 1/(ND), which isessentially the reciprocal of the trace length, ( N1)D. On theopposite extreme, the frequency corresponding to m = 1 + N/2is the Nyquist frequency, 1/(2D). The extreme range ofsurface wavelengths included in the measurement is therefore1/(ND) &lt; f &lt; 1/(2D). In other words, the extreme LFL =1/(ND), the extreme HFL = 1/(2D), and the dynamic range ofthe measurement is N/2.NOTE 12: A convenient and readable reference to the FFTand its evaluation is Chapter 12 in Numerical Recipes byPress, Flannery, Teukolsky, and Vetterling (see Section 7.1).NOTE 13: The Brookhaven National Laboratory Report (seeSection 7.2) contains further background information on theseprocedures along with a computer program and numericalexamples. (The BASIC routines used there involve differentforms for the quantities MP appearing in the expressions forthe detrending polynomials than those discussed in this guide,although the numerical values of the detrending polynomialsare identical in both cases.)NOTE 14: The periodogram estimator just given is not theonly method of estimating the power spectral density from aset of profile data, but it is the most direct and commonmethod. It is sufficient for general use, and is a necessaryfirst step to be taken before adding embellishments such aspost-processing or considering more complicated estimators.This guide does not exclude the use of post-processing oralternative methods of analysis, but does require that the basicperiodogram estimates just described be included in thediscussion for comparative purposes. 5.4.3 Form for 1-dimensional Power Spectral Densityfor slope-measuring profilometers is as follows: NmKmDNDmmS )()(FFT2)1(2)(221 =) (34) where: = =N nNmnindMnWem1 )1)(1(2)()()(TFF ) and )(ndM) is the value of the profile slope measure-ments detrended using either the least-squares piston orthe piston-plus-tilt expressions (see Section 5.1).NOTE 15: This estimate of the profile power spectrum is thepower spectrum of the profile slope divided by (2fm ) 2. Theprime on the FFT on the left denotes that it involves sloperather than height data.NOTE 16: The case m = 1 corresponds to zero spatial fre-quency and must be excluded in the use of the aboveexpressions.

Although q) is in units ofradians, its magnitude scales as 1/D.5.6 Window Functions5.6.1 Window functions appear in a wide variety ofsignal-processing applications, with different shapesand normalizations. Although this guide recommendsthe use of the Hann or Blackman window, other formsare included for comparison. All are normalized so that ==N nnWN 12 1)(1 in order to preserve the magnitudes of average values of the mean-square profile statistics.5.6.2 Particular forms are:5.6.2.1 Rectangular or Daniell window:1)( =nW (37) 5.6.2.2 Hann, or Raised Cosine window:   = NnnW )1(2cos12417282)( (38) 5.6.2.3 Hamming window:   = NnnW )1(2cos232719872)( (39) 5.6.2.4 Blackman window:  + = NnNnnW )1(4cos4)1(2cos252115232)( (40) NOTE 17: The choice of window functions is of minorimportance for randomly-rough surfaces as long as itsmoothes the data at the ends of the data record. Therectangular or Daniell window does not do this, but is usefulfor numerical checking.NOTE 18: In the case of profiles with a smooth PSD, theprincipal effect the window shape is to change the fine-scalefluctuations in the periodogram estimate without changing itsensemble-average value, except, perhaps, near the LFL.NOTE 19: In the case of profiles involving periodicities, thewindow shape can change the shape of the sharp lines in thePSD, albeit without changing their areas. The choice of thewindow shape then involves a trade-off between line widthand smoothness. The raised Hann or Blackman windows arerecommended for general use.NOTE 20: If the estimation routines are applied todeterministic profiles, such as individual steps, pits, or bumps,a data window must still be used to minimize effects of thefinite data record, but the object should be placed in the centerof the profile where the window function is relatively flat. 5.7 Zero Padding5.7.1 The fastest FFT routines require the total numberof data points to be a power of two, such as N = 2 10 =1024. If the number of measured points, N, is not apower of two but lies between 2a and 2b, the power-of-two routines can be used by dropping N2a points fromone end of the original data set, or by adding 2bNzeros and replacing N in the routines everywhere by 2b.5.7.2 The first method is wasteful of data, while thesecond uses the full set of measured data but requiresthat the estimated PSD be renormalized by multiplyingit by the factor 2b/N.5.8 Averaging of Statistical Quantities:5.8.1 Power spectral density functions, the mean-square roughness, and slope values estimated from anumber of individual profiles that have the samestatistical properties can each be averaged together toobtain composite results. In the case of homogeneouslyand isotropically rough surfaces the profiles can lie inany position and direction on the surface under test. Inthe case of homogeneously but anisotropically roughsurfaces they can lie anywhere on the surface but mustlie parallel with each other, preferably perpendicular tothe surface axis. Averaging data lowers the errorsassociated with individual measurements. 6 Numerical Test Sequences6.1 Table 1 presents a set of numerical data for testingthe execution of the users implementations ofalgorithms discussed in Section 5.6.2 Although these simulated profile data are instandard notation, they have been generated by a

The values ofthese estimates depend on the data window used. Table2 uses a rectangular window and Table 3 uses theBlackman window.6.6 The dimensions of the power spectral densities inthese tables is length-cubed = (units of Z) 2(units of D),and its magnitude at a given spatial frequency scales asthe sampling interval, D.6.7 The spatial frequency is given as follows: NDmf m1= (41) where:m = 1 corresponds to the dc or piston part of theprofile, andm = 1 + N/2 = 17 is the Nyquist frequency in(units of D1).6.7.1 Note that since the window function has beenapplied after the detrending process, the dc terms do notnecessarily vanish for a non-rectangular windowfunctions. 6.8 Table 4 gives values of qR) derived from thespectra in Table 2 and Table 3 using the expressiongiven in Table 4. 6.8.1 As mentioned, the unit of qR) is the same as thatof the height measurement since the magnitude and dimensions of the sampling interval, D, cancels out inthe evaluation of Rq.6.9 The data in Table 2 through Table 4 are adequatefor checking the users' implementation of the estimatorsdescribed in Section 5, and further test data are notincluded in this guide. 7 Related Documents7.1 Press, W.

SEMI MF1982-1103 © SEMI 20031 SEMI MF1982-1103TEST METHODS FOR ANALYZING ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS ONSILICON WAFER SURFACES BY THERMAL DESORPTION GASCHROMATOGRAPHY This standard was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication bythe North American Regional Standards Committee on July 27, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.orgOctober 2003; to be published November 2003. Originally published by ASTM International as ASTMF 1982-99. Last previous edition ASTM F 1982-991.1 Purpose1.1 Organics are present in many materials, such asplastics, lubricants, cleansers, soaps, and living tissues.Some of these compounds are volatile and others canbecome airborne through chemical reactions, heating,abrasion, or outgassing. Also they can transfer towafers by direct contact or be left behind from solventresidues. Once present in clean facilities, they candeposit on wafer surfaces. Organics deposited onwafers can cause degradation haze, wafer surfacetension changes, irregular oxidation rates, and othereffects, such as counter-doping by organophosphoruscompounds. Identification of trace level organiccontaminants is important in determining the source ofthe particular contamination. These test methods usethe TD-GC technique to characterize and quantifyorganics deposited on wafer surfaces.1.2 Monitoring of organic contamination on wafersurfaces also can be used to measure materialoutgassing for proper selection of cleanroom,construction, and wafer packaging materials. 2 Scope2.1 These test methods cover the identification andquantification of organic contaminants on silicon wafersurfaces using a gas chromatograph interfaced to a massspectrometer (GC-MS) or a phosphorus selectivedetector, or both.2.2 These test methods describe the apparatus andrelated procedures for sample preparation and analysesby thermal desorption gas chromatography (TD-GC).1,2 2.3 The range of detection limits of these test methodsdepends on the target organic compounds, for example,the range of detection limits is from the subpicogram tothe nanogram level of hydrocarbons (C8 to C28) persquare centimeter of silicon wafer surface. 1 Fergason, L.A., Analysis of Organic Impurities on Silicon WaferSurfaces, Microcontamination, 4(4), 33-37, April 1986.2 Saga, K. and Hattori, T., Identification and Removal of TraceOrganic Contamination on Silicon Wafers Stored in Plastic Boxes,Journal of Electrochemical Society, 143, 3270-3284 (1996). 2.4 These test methods can be used for polished siliconwafers, or silicon wafers with oxide films.2.5 Two methods are described. Method A isperformed on cleaved wafers. Method B is performedon full wafers. The detailed procedures of Method Aand Method B as well as the differences between them,are described in Sections 5 and 7 .2.6 Suitable safety precautions must be followed whenhandling organic solvents and compounds, hotmaterials subjected to propane flame, the propane flameitself, wafer thermal desorption systems, rapid thermalannealer, or a high temperature furnace.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use.

In Method Bsurface organic contaminants are desorbed by purgingthem out in the heated quartz chamber unit whilehelium gas is flowing as a purge gas. 5 Summary of Test Methods5.1 Method A5.1.1 Desorption and GC Analysis  The volatileorganic contaminants on a wafer surface are desorbedthermally from the wafer surface in a wafer desorptionoven and swept into a sample thermal desorption tube.The sample thermal desorption tube then is heated for aset period in the thermal desorption unit and the volatileorganic contaminants desorbed from the sample thermaldesorption tube are swept by a stream of helium to acold trap where they are preconcentrated. At the end ofthis period, the cold trap is heated rapidly to release thetrapped organics to the GC column head. Samplecomponents then are separated and eluted out of the GCcolumn. Then, a portion goes to a phosphorus selectivedetector and the remainder goes to a mass spectrometer(MS). Blank wafers are prepared by purging out anysurface organic contaminants in a rapid thermalannealer or a high temperature furnace while a purgegas is flowing.5.1.2 Identification of Contaminants  Identificationof individual unknown compounds is performed bycorrespondence of retention time of their peaks withthat of known compounds. Correspondence of reten-tion time on a single column should not be regarded asproof of identity. More precise identification ofindividual unknown compounds is performed with MSby matching their fragmentation patterns with massspectra of known compounds in the spectral library.5.1.3 Quantification  Quantification of total organicsis based on the comparison of the integrated total peakarea of the sample peaks with the area of the externalstandard compound, n-C16H 34. Total organophosphorus content in a sample is quantified by comparing thesample signal integrated from the phosphorus selectivedetector with the signal of the phosphorus standardcompound, tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) ortributyl phosphate (TBP). Specified range of standardsis measured periodically, and the result is reported withblank wafer data.5.2 Method B5.2.1 Desorption and GC Analysis  The volatileorganic contaminants on a wafer surface are desorbedthermally from the wafer surface in a quartz chamberunit and swept into a glass TD tube. The glass TD tubethen is heated for a set period and a stream of heliumsweeps the volatile organic contaminants desorbed fromthe glass TD tube to a cold trap where they arepreconcentrated. At the end of this period, the cold trapis heated rapidly to release the trapped organics to theGC column head. Sample components then are sepa-rated and eluted out of the GC column. Then, a portiongoes to a phosphorus selective detector and theremainder goes to a mass spectrometer (MS). Blankwafers are prepared by purging out any surface organiccontaminants in the heated quartz chamber unit, whilehelium gas is flowing as a purge gas.5.2.2 Identification of Contaminants  Identificationof individual unknown compounds is performed bycorrespondence of retention time of their peaks withthat of known compounds. Correspondence ofretention time on a single column should not beregarded as a proof of identity. More preciseidentification of individual unknown compounds isperformed with MS by matching their fragmentationpatterns with mass spectra of known compounds in thespectral library.5.2.3 Quantification  Quantification of total organicsis based on the comparison of the integrated total peakarea of the sample peaks with the area of the externalstandard compound, n-C16H 34. Total organophosphoruscontent in a sample is quantified by comparing thesample signal integrated from a phosphorus selectivedetector with the signal of the phosphorus standardcompound, tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) ortributyl phosphate (TBP). Specified range of standardsis measured periodically, and the result is reported withblank wafer data. 6 Apparatus6.1 Method A6.1.1 GC Instrument  Utilizes a capillary column toseparate a wide variety of organic compounds coupledto a mass spectrometer (MS), or a phosphorus selectivedetector, or both. Examples of phosphorus selectivedetectors are flame photometric detector (FPD), and

&lt;!-- Page 22 --&gt;

SEMI MF1982-1103 © SEMI 20033 atomic emission detector (AED). Thenitrogen/phosphorus thermionic ionization detector(NPD) also responds to nitrogen containingcompounds.NOTE 1: A nitrogen/phosphorus thermionic ionizationdetector (NPD) may also be used as a phosphorus selectivedetector. This type of detector also responds to nitrogencontaining compounds. If an NPD is used, the totalorganophosphorus reported should exclude any signals due tonitrogen containing compounds. Often, identification fromthe mass spectra can be used to determine whether compoundcontains nitrogen or phosphorus, or both. 6.1.2 Sample Thermal Desorption Tubes  Stainless-steel tubes packed with adsorbent medium, are used totrap compounds of interest and release them onto athermal desorption unit.NOTE 2: Note that stainless steel is catalytically active andcan corrode with time, affecting recovery for somecompounds. In this case, deactivated stainless steel, glass, orquartz tubes also can be used. Several adsorbent materialscan be used for trapping organic compounds desorbed fromsilicon wafer samples. Some examples are activated carbon,graphitized carbon, and poly (2,6-diphenyl-p-phenyleneoxide).6.1.3 Thermal Desorption Unit  Used to desorborganics from sample thermal desorption tubes. Thethermal desorption unit is coupled to the GC instrumentvia a heated transfer line, for example, heated to 225Cor above.6.1.4 Thermal Annealer  Or a high temperaturefurnace used to obtain a blank wafer (see Section7.1.1.2 ).6.1.5 Temperature Controllable Wafer DesorptionOven  Used to hold and heat a wafer desorption tube.6.1.6 Wafer Desorption Tube  Stainless-steel tubewith an approximate dimension: 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) inouter diameter, 9.53 mm (0.375 in.) in inner diameterand 254 mm (10 in.) in length (see Figure 1), used todesorb organics from cleaved wafers. Larger tubes maybe used for larger wafer sizes and to increase thesensitivity of the test (see Note 2).6.1.7 Analytical Balance6.1.8 Quartz Plate and Carbide-Tipped Scribe  Usedto cleave wafer samples.6.1.9 Quick Connect  Used to connect a nitrogen lineto the wafer desorption tube.6.2 Method B6.2.1 GC Instrument  Utilizes a capillary column toseparate a wide variety of organic compounds, coupledto a mass spectrometer (MS) or a phosphorus selectivedetector, or both. Examples of phosphorus selective detectors are flame photometric detector (FPD), atomicemission detector (AED), or nitrogen/phosphorusthermionic ionization detector (NPD). Thenitrogen/phosphorus thermionic ionization detector(NPD) also responds to nitrogen containing compounds(see Note 1).6.2.2 Quartz Chamber Unit  Used to desorb organiccontaminants from the wafer surface and transfer themto a glass TD tube (see Figure 2).6.2.3 Quartz Chamber  May be used also to purgeout any organic contaminants from a blank wafer.6.2.4 Glass TD Tube  Packed with adsorbentmedium used to trap compounds of interest and releasethem onto a cold trap. Several adsorbent materials canbe used for trapping organic compounds desorbed fromsilicon wafer samples. Some examples are activatedcarbon, graphitized carbon, and poly (2,6-diphenyl-p-phenylene oxide).6.2.5 Cold Trap  Used to concentrate organicsdesorbed from glass TD tube and release the organics toa GC instrument by rapid heating. 7 Procedure7.1 Method A7.1.1 Sample Handling and Preparation7.1.1.1 At all times, avoid manual handling of samplesfor analysis to prevent any secondary contamination ofsamples. Use stainless steel tweezers for samplepreparation. Use a propane torch to flame stainlesssteel tweezers, weigh boats, and other accessories thatcome into direct contact with the sample before theirusage.7.1.1.2 Thermally debsorb any organics from blankwafers in a rapid thermal annealer or a high temperaturefurnace. In order to desorb any organics from blankwafers, the temperature of a rapid thermal annealer iskept at 900C for 15 s, or the temperature of a hightemperature furnace is kept at 700C for 30 min.Heating under air or oxygen will make a consistentorganic-free SiO2 surface. Place the thermally treatedblank wafers directly into petri dishes and wrap thedishes with organic-free aluminum foil.7.1.2 Wafer Desorption7.1.2.1 Clean and precondition sample thermaldesorption tubes in accordance with ASTM PracticeD 6196 prior to attaching to the wafer desorption tube.7.1.2.2 Turn on the temperature controller for the waferdesorption oven and wait for the temperature to reach275C.

SEMI MF1982-1103 © SEMI 2003 4 7.1.2.3 Cleave the wafer sample into strips about 5 to 7mm wide by scribing a line on the wafer where onewants it to break and then placing it on a straight wireand breaking it along the scribed line. The portion ofthe wafer sample needed for the analysis changes withthe size of the wafer. For a 100-mm wafer, about halfof its surface area is needed. Larger samples (havinglarger surface area) may be used to increase thesensitivity of the test.7.1.2.4 Place the wafer strips of wafer into the waferdesorption tube. Attach a sample thermal desorptiontube to the side of the wafer desorption tube. Connectthe other end of the wafer desorption tube to a nitrogenline with a flow of 15 to 100 mL/min.7.1.2.5 Place the wafer desorption tube in the oven andheat it for 30 min at 275C. This allows the volatileorganics to be thermally desorbed from the samplewafer and transferred to the sample thermal desorptiontube.7.1.2.6 Seal both ends of the sample thermal desorptiontube into the thermal desorption unit or by using caps ifthe thermal desorption-GC system is automated. Tubesmust not be left open and exposed to the laboratoryatmosphere. The end caps should be made of a materialthat has low outgassing and low reactivity properties,such as poly tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or stainlesssteel.7.1.2.7 Analyze a blank wafer at least daily. Use ablank wafer treated with the same desorption procedurejust described. Report blank data with the sample data.7.1.3 GC Analysis7.1.3.1 Place the sample thermal desorption tube,which contains organic contaminants desorbed from thewafer, onto the thermal desorption unit. Enter thesample information into the computer, and start the GCanalysis.7.1.3.2 Flow the helium carrier gas through the samplethermal desorption tube during primary desorption.Heat the sample thermal desorption tube and sweep outthe target organics contained in the sample to a coldtrap where they are preconcentrated. Tworecommended conditions for heating the sampledesorption tube are as follows. When graphitizedcarbon is used as adsorbent material, heat the tube to400C and hold at 400C for 15 min. When poly (2,6-diphenyl-p-phenylene oxide) is used as adsorbentmaterial, heat the tube to 270C and hold at 270C for15 min. Cold trap parameters, that is, sorbent, soldtemperature, etc., should be selected such that all targetanalytes are retained quantitatively throughout the tubedesorption process, for example, using a cold traptemperature of 30C. Refer to ASTM Practice D 6196 for a method for testing desorption efficiency andanalyte recovery. At the end of this period, heat thecold trap rapidly to 300C to release the target organicsto the GC column head.NOTE 3: For higher sensitivity analysis, larger sample sizescan be used, but clogging by water is possible. In this case, asubambient cold trap with an adsorbent may be used andmaintained higher than 0C during trapping to prevent freeze-up of trap. 7.1.3.3 Separate volatile organics desorbed from thesample thermal desorption tube by an appropriatecolumn temperature program. Two recommendedtemperature programs are as follows. For highresolution analysis, using polydimethylsiloxane-coatedcolumn (60 m by 0.25 mm by 0.25m film thickness),heat the column from 40 to 280C at a rate of 10C/minand hold the temperature at 280 C for 16 min. Forrapid analysis, using polydimethylsiloxane-coatedcolumn (25 m by 0.32 mm by 0.52m film thickness),heat the column from 30 to 265C at a rate of12.5C/min and hold the temperature at 265C for 16min.7.1.3.4 Use n-Hexadecane, n-C16H 34(C16), as a standardfor total organic analysis 4. Use tris (2-chloroethyl)phosphate, (ClCH 2CH 2O) 3PO (TCEP) or tributylphosphate, (C4H 9O) 3 PO (TBP), as a standard fororganophosphorus analysis (see Section 6.1.1 ). Thesestandards are introduced into the GC system from aprecleaned sample thermal desorption tube. Two-pointcalibration method is recommended for checking theinstrument performance. Recommended standards aretwo different concentrations of n-C16H 34 (C16 ) for totalorganic analysis; and, two different concentrations oftris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) for totalorganophosphorus analysis. Recommended frequencyof these measurements is at least once a week.NOTE 4: AED and FID are recommended for accurate totalcarbon quantification. 7.1.4 Quantification7.1.4.1 Obtain each area below for the calculation oftotal organic contaminants. Obtain total organiccontaminants of the sample wafer (As) by summing upall the peak areas integrated from GC-AED, FID, orMS chromatogram of the sample wafer. Obtain totalarea of the blank wafer (Ab) by summing up all the peakareas integrated from GC-AED, FID, or MSchromatogram of the blank wafer. Obtain the area ofthe standard peak (Ac) integrated from GC-AED, FID,or MS chromatogram of the standard sample.7.1.4.2 Obtain each area below for the calculation oftotal organophosphorus (TP). Obtain total area ofphosphorus compounds of the sample wafer (As) by

Obtain total area of the blank wafer (Ab)by summing up all the peak areas integrated from GC-(phosphorus selective detector) chromatogram of theblank wafer. Obtain the area of the standard peak (Ap)integrated from GC-(phosphorus selective detector)chromatogram of the standard sample.7.1.4.3 Before starting analysis, weigh and get the totalweight of each sample wafer to be tested, and also theweight of unused part of each wafer. These weights areused for the calculation of total organic contaminantsand total organophosphorus (TP).7.2 Method B7.2.1 Sample Handling and Preparation7.2.1.1 At all times, avoid manual handling of samplesfor analysis to prevent any secondary contamination ofsamples. Use stainless steel tweezers for samplepreparation. Use a propane torch to flame stainlesssteel tweezers and other accessories that come intodirect contact with the sample before their usage.7.2.1.2 Thermally desorb any organics from blankwafers in the quartz chamber unit. Recommendedconditions for preparing blank wafers are to heat themfor 30 min in the quartz chamber kept at 700C.Usually, helium is used as purge gas. Heating under airor oxygen will make a consistent organic-free SiO 2surface.7.2.2 Wafer Desorption7.2.2.1 Enter the analytical information into the quartschamber unit, cold trap and GC. Wait for the system tobe stabilized. Place the sample wafer into the quartzchamber unit and start it. Supply helium gas into thequartz chamber and heat the chamber from initialtemperature (40C or lower) to 400C at a rate of 10 to30C/min, and hold the temperature for 15 min. Sweepout the volatiles contained in the sample to a glass TDtube where they are adsorbed.7.2.2.2 Analyze a blank wafer at least daily. Reportblank data with the sample data.7.2.3 GC Analysis7.2.3.1 Heat the glass TD tube and sweep out the targetorganics adsorbed in the tube to a cold trap where theyare preconcentrated. Two recommended conditions forheating the glass TD tube are as follows: When graphitized carbon is used as adsorbentmaterial, heat the tube to 400C and hold at 400Cfor 15 min.  When poly (2,6-diphenyl-p-phenylene oxide) isused as adsorbent material, heat the tube to 270Cand hold for 15 min.7.2.3.2 Select cold trap parameters, that is, sorbent,cold temperature, etc., such that all target analytes arequantitatively retained throughout the tube desorptionprocess, for example using a cold trap temperature of130C. Refer to ASTM Practice D 6196 for a methodfor testing desorption efficiency and analyte recovery.At the end of this period, heat the cold trap rapidly to300C to release the target organics to the GC columnhead.7.2.3.3 Separate volatile organics desorbed from theglass TD tube by an appropriate column temperatureprogram. Two recommended temperature programs areas follows. For high resolution analysis, usepolydimethylsiloxane coated column (60 m by 0.25 mmby 0.25-m film thickness), heat the column from 40 to280C at a rate of 10C/min and hold the temperature at280C for 16 min. For rapid analysis, usepolydimethylsiloxane coated column (25 m by 0.32 mmby 0.52-m film thickness), heat the column from 30 to265C at a rate of 12.5C/min and hold the temperatureat 265C for 16 min.7.2.3.4 Use n-Hexadecane, n-C16H 34(C16), as a standardfor total organic analysis (see Note 4). Use tris (2chloroethyl) phosphate, (ClCH2CH 2O) 3PO (TCEP) ortributyl phosphate, (C4H 9O) 3PO (TBP), as a standardfor organophosphorus analysis (see Section 6.1.1).These standards are introduced into the GC systemfrom a precleaned wafer. A two-point calibrationmethod is recommended for checking the instrumentperformance. Recommended standards are twodifferent concentrations of n-C16H 34 (C16) for totalorganic analysis; and two different concentrations oftris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) for totalorganophosphorus analysis. Recommended frequencyof these measurements is at least once a week.7.2.4 Quantification7.2.4.1 Obtain each area below for the calculation oftotal organic contaminants.

Current edition approved for publication bythe North American Regional Standards Committee on July 27, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.orgOctober 2003; to be published November 2003.

SEMI MF2139-1103 © SEMI 2003 2 charged particle activation analysis detection capabilityis limited by an interference from boron.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address thesafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Nitrogen on or in the surface silicon oxide caninterfere with the bulk nitrogen measurement.3.2 Nitrogen adsorbed on the test specimen surfacefrom the SIMS instrument chamber and fixturesinterfere with the bulk nitrogen measurement by raisingthe background signal. The vacuum quality of theSIMS instrument can be used to minimize this.3.3 Nitrogen in the SIMS primary Cs beam may beimplanted into the silicon specimen as CsN and therebyincrease the nitrogen background concentration. Aprimary beam mass filter may be used to reduce thisinterference, but in this case, a reduced Cs beam currentdensity is needed to maximize the sputter rate.3.4 Anomalous nitrogen intensity spikes can interferewith the averaging of signal intensity which is assumedto be random (see Section 6.9).3.5 Carbon introduces an interference as 12C30Si atmass 42 for detecting nitrogen as 14N 28Si. This can beavoided by detecting the nitrogen as 14N 29Si at mass 43,but the signal rate is reduced greatly, about a factor of20 when the minor isotope of silicon is used. There aremethods to measure the carbon interference, andsubtract this interference. One of the methods tomeasure the carbon interference can have its owninterference from high levels of boron dopant.3.6 The specimen surface must be flat in the specimenholder window so that the inclination of the specimensurface with respect to the ion collection optics isconstant from specimen to specimen. Otherwise, theaccuracy and precision can be degraded.3.7 The bias and precision of the measurementsignificantly degrade as the roughness of the specimensurface increases. This degradation can be avoided byusing chemical-mechanical polished wafers.3.8 Variability of nitrogen in the calibration specimencan limit the measurement precision.3.9 Variability from the calibration measurement mayincrease the measurement precision of the testspecimen. 3.10 Bias in the assigned nitrogen concentration of thecalibration specimen can introduce bias into the SIMSmeasured nitrogen.3.11 Thermal processing above 800°C of the siliconsubstrate may cause diffusion of the nitrogen, so thatthe nitrogen concentration is not constant with depth, akey assumption of this test method.3.12 Thermal processing of the silicon substrates in anitrogen-containing ambient can introduce largeamounts of nitrogen from the ambient deep into thesilicon crystal.6 4 Referenced Standards4.1 ASTM Standards9 E 122  Practice for Calculating Sample Size to Esti-mate, with a Specified Tolerable Error, the Average fora Characteristic of a Lot or ProcessE 673  Terminology Relating to Surface AnalysisNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions  all terms in this test method are inaccordance with those given in ASTM TerminologyE 673. 6 Summary of Test Method6.1 SIMS is utilized to determine the bulkconcentration of nitrogen in single crystal siliconsubstrate. Specimens of single crystal silicon (onecalibration specimen and the test specimens) are loadedinto a sample holder. The holder with the specimens isbaked at 100°C in air for 1 h and then transferred intothe analysis chamber of the SIMS instrument.6.2 The calibration sample is analyzed using a cesium(Cs) primary ion beam and negative ion spectrometry of14N 28Si, or 15N28Si, depending upon the nitrogen isotopein the calibration sample, to determine a relativesensitivity factor (RSF) of nitrogen in silicon.6.3 Each test specimen in the sample holder issputtered by the primary cesium ion beam, withoutanalyzing secondary ion intensities, in order to reducethe nitrogen background. The amount of time requiredfor this pre-analysis sputtering depends upon theinstrumentation and the desired background nitrogenconcentration. 9 Available from ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, WestConshohoken, PA 19428-2959, USA.

Thisbeam raster change technique is used for two reasons.Firstly, this technique reduces the background nitrogencontribution from the sample surface. Secondly, thistechnique allows the determination of both theinstrumental nitrogen background and the real bulknitrogen concentration in each test specimenmeasurement without the use of a separate blankspecimen, and due to averaging is capable of separatingthe bulk nitrogen from the instrumental nitrogen even ifthe bulk nitrogen is less than the instrumentalnitrogen.10 6.5 The two sputter rates, and the amount of time theyare applied in each measurement, are chosen tooptimize the detection capability; the values depend onthe instrumentation being used. However, the secondsputter rate is typically the maximum sputter rate of theinstrumentation, and the first sputter rate is typicallyless than half that of the second sputter rate.6.6 The negative secondary ion of 14 N 28Si is massanalyzed by a mass spectrometer, and detected by anelectron multiplier (EM) or equivalent high-sensitivityion detector as a function of time. The matrix negativesecondary ion count for silicon ( 28Si, 29Si, 30Si, or a 10 Ishitani, A., Okuno, K., Karen, A., Karen, S. and Soeda, F.,Improvement of Oxygen Detection Limit in Silicon by Use of theSecondary Ion Energy Distribution and Background Subtraction, inProceedings of the International Conference of Materials andProcess Characterization for VLSI, 1988 (ICMPC'88), edited by X-FZong, Y-Y Wang, and J. Chen, (World Scientific, New Jersey, 1988)pp. 124-129. dimer such as 30 Si2) is measured by a Faraday cup (FC)or appropriate detector during the profile. If multipledetectors are used during the test, the relativesensitivities of the detectors are determined bymeasuring standard ion signals (either the samenegative secondary ion count rate or ion count rates ofknown relative intensity such as natural 28Si/30Si) oneach detector. Additional negative secondary ions of11B28Si, 12C, and 12 C28Si may also be detected depen-ding upon the boron and carbon concentration in thetest specimen.6.7 For illustration purposes an example data profile isshown in Figure 1 where the log of counts of 12C 28Si,14N, 28Si, and 30Si is plotted versus sputter time. Atabout 200 s, the Cs beam raster area was changed from250 m  250 m down to 50 m  50 m, resulting inan increase in signal intensities, because the volume ofmaterial analyzed per second has increased. At about350 s, the Cs beam raster area was reversed back to thefirst condition, and the signal intensities are seen to bereduced back to the original levels. Since the surfaceanalysis area was kept constant during the raster change(that is, the actual surface area detected is independentof the raster area), the signal intensities have twoseparate contributions, one from elements that areadsorbed to the surface and one from elements in thevolume of material analyzed each second. There issome nitrogen (and carbon in this case) that is adsorbedto the surface from the local environment outside of thesilicon, and there is some nitrogen that is from the bulksilicon. A key point is that if there is no nitrogen in thebulk silicon, the nitrogen signal intensity does notchange as a result of the change in sputter rate, becausethe adsorbed nitrogen (that is, instrumental nitrogensignal) is only dependent on the analysis area, whichhas been held constant. This understanding leads to thefollowing equations: \]\[\]\[ NNRSFII bsin += (1) \]\[\]\[ NNRSFII BSIN += (2) RSFIINsiBb =\]\[ (3) RSFIINSIBB =\]\[ (4) where:I n = secondary ion intensity of 14N 28Si under thehigher sputter rate conditions,I N = secondary ion intensity of 14N 28Si under thelower sputter rate conditions,

In the exampleshown in Figure 1, the lower sputter rate was used atthe beginning of the profile, and the higher sputter ratein the middle of the profile. For this example, \[N\] wasdetermined to be 8  10 14/cm3 and \[Nb\] was 2 10 14 /cm3 . The use of averages for I n and I N isparticularly critical for detecting low levels of nitrogenwhere the signal intensity count rates can be low andtherefore noisy. By using averages, it is possible todetect an \[N\] level that is less than \[Nb\] in the analysis.6.9 The SIMS measurement of nitrogen in bulk-dopedsilicon sometimes reveals anomalous intensity spikesthat are greater than a random fluctuation of signalintensity, even in silicon that has not been thermallyprocessed beyond crystal growth.6,7 These nitrogenintensity spikes are not well understood, but aresuspected to be associated with oxygen defects,possibly a co-aggregation of nitrogen and oxygen in aprecipitate form. Similar SIMS effects have been wellknown for oxygen and even carbon in thermally-processed silicon.11 Figure 2 shows an expanded viewof the carbon and nitrogen data taken from Figure 1. 11 Hockett, R.

The vertical scale is linear. The unusually highnitrogen signal at about 325 s may be one of theseanomalous intensity spikes. The presence of such non-random signals, if significant, can make the averagingmethod used here questionable. NOTE: Top curve (!) Mass 42 ( 14N28Si), bottom curve(") Mass 40 ( 12C28Si)Figure 2SIMS Signals from Nitrogen-Doped Silicon, LinearScale 6.10 Depending upon the carbon concentration in thetest specimen and the level of nitrogen, it may benecessary to correct the 14 N28Si signal for an interfer-ence from 12 C30Si. This correction is done by co-detecting 12C28Si at mass 40, and calculating thecontribution of 12 C30Si from isotopic ratios. Thecontribution to mass 42 from a carbon-related signal atmass 40 is 0.0341 times the signal at mass 40. In theexample in Figure 1, where the actual carbon concen-tration is about 1.5  10 15/cm3 by SIMS calibration, thecarbon interference is insignificant. A carbon concen-tration of 5  10 15/cm3 (the detection limit of mostFourier Transform Infrared (FITR) measurements ofcarbon in silicon) corresponds to an interference equi-valent to about 8  10 13/cm3 of nitrogen. Thus, indetecting nitrogen in the low 1014/cm3 level, a co-measurement of the carbon interference is critical.6.11 Depending upon the boron concentration in thetest specimen, the procedure to correct for the carboninterference may need to be modified by detecting11B28 Si at mass 39, and calculating the contribution of11B29Si and 10B30 Si at mass 40. This procedurebecomes important for test specimens with boronconcentrations at 1  10 17/cm3 and greater. In theexample in Figure 1, the boron concentration is on theorder of 10 15/cm3 and does not interfere.

SEMI MF2139-1103 © SEMI 20035 7 Apparatus7.1 SIMS Instrument  Equipped with a cesiumprimary ion source, electron multiplier detector, andFaraday cup detector, capable of measuring negativesecondary ions. The SIMS instrument should beadequately prepared (that is, baked) so as to provide thelowest possible instrumental background, since theinstrumental background can affect the detectioncapability. High quality vacuum is desired. A liquidnitrogen- or liquid helium-cooled cryopanel, whichsurrounds the test specimen holder in the analysischamber, may be helpful.7.2 Test Specimen Holder7.3 Oven  For baking the test specimen holder.7.4 Stylus Profilometer  Or equivalent device tomeasure SIMS crater depths. This device is required tocalibrate depth scale for concentration profiles ofcalibration standard samples. 8 Reagents and Materials8.1 No reagents or materials are required for this testmethod. 9 Safety Precautions9.1 The preparation of silicon test specimens fromsilicon substrates requires the crystal to be cleaved orbroken. This procedure may generate very sharpsilicon shards. Care must be taken to protect the bodyand particularly the eyes from these shards. 10 Sampling, Test Specimens, and Test Units10.1 Since this procedure is destructive in nature, asampling procedure must be used to evaluate thecharacteristics of a group of silicon wafers. No generalsampling procedure is included as part of this testmethod, because the most suitable sampling plandepends upon individual conditions. For refereepurposes, a sampling plan shall be agreed upon beforeconducting the test. See ASTM Practice E 122 forsuggested choices of sampling plans.10.2 The calibration or reference material shall besilicon crystal with boron concentration below 2  10 17atoms/cm3 and implanted with ions of 14N or 15N; anion implant of energy 200 keV and dose of about 1 10 14 atoms/cm2 is preferred.10.3 Sample specimens must have a chemo-mechanicalpolished surface on the side used for analysis. 11 Calibration and Standardization11.1 Calculate the RSF for an element in a matrixexperimentally from the SIMS profile of a reference material containing a known areal density of theimpurity of interest as follows: )( nISIdtInDRSFbim= (7) where:D = a real density of the impurity, atoms/cm2 ,n = number of data cycles in the profile,I m = matrix isotope secondary ion intensity, counts/s,d = sputtered depth, cm,SI i = sum of the impurity isotope secondary ion(counts over the depth of the profile),I b = constant background intensity of the impurityisotope, counts/cycle andt = analysis time for the species of interest, s/cycle.11.2 Calculate the calibration of concentration in theSIMS profile as follows: EMFCRSFIICmii = (8) where:Ci = impurity atomic concentration, atoms/cm3,I i = isotope secondary ion intensity, counts/s,I m = matrix isotope secondary ion-intensity,counts/s,RSF = relative sensitivity factor, atoms/cm3, and EMFC = ratio of matrix intensities on the Faradaycup (FC) to the electron multiplier (EM),when two detectors are used.11.3 Complete the conversion of data cycles or timeinto depth by measuring the crater depth and the totaltime (or data cycles) of the sputtering that formed thecrater.NOTE 1: The depth scale is assumed to be linear with time ordata cycles. 12 Procedure12.1 Cleave or break specimens from the siliconsubstrates in order to fit within the SIMS sample holder.Specimens must be handled under normal analyticallaboratory practices, but no special ambient is required.12.2 Load the specimens into the SIMS sample holder,checking to see that the specimens are flat against thebacks of the windows and cover the windows as muchas is possible. A specimen load includes onecalibration specimen, and one or more test specimens.12.3 Bake the loaded sample holder at 100 ± 10°C fora minimum of 1 h in air.12.4 Turn on the instrument in accordance with themanufacturer's instructions.

Afterthe entire sample load is analyzed, measure the SIMScrater depth in this sample using a profilometer.12.7 Position the specimen holder to sputter a crater ina test specimen near the center of the window. Withoutdetecting secondary ion intensities, begin a SIMSprofile.12.8 Repeat Section 12.7 for each test specimen.12.9 If the boron level in the test specimen is below 1 10 17 /cm3 , detect the negative ions of 12 C28Si, 14N 28Si,and a matrix signal ( 28Si, 29Si, 30Si, or 30Si2 ). If theboron level is at or above 1  10 17/cm3, include thedetection of the negative ion of 11B28Si.12.10 For the analysis of the test specimens, select tworaster conditions, one to maximize the sputter rate, andone that provides a slower sputter rate. Chooseapertures or other means to maintain the analysis areaunder raster change and to keep the negative ion countrates on the electron multiplier detector below 1  10 5counts/s for the test specimen.12.11 Position the specimen holder to sputter a newcrater near the crater created in Section 12.7 or Section12.8 . Do not make the second crater in the same cratercreated in Section 12.7 or Section 12.8 .12.12 Center the primary ion beam and begin a SIMSprofile with the raster area that produces the lowersputter rate. Continue the profile until all signalsprovide relatively constant intensity for at least 20 datapoints.12.13 Change the raster area to maximize the signalintensity. Continue the profile under this rastercondition for at least 20 data points.12.14 Reduce the raster area back to the originalcondition.12.15 If the boron content is less than 1  10 17/cm3,subtract 0.0341 times the measured mass 40 signal(counts/s) from the measured mass 42 signal (counts/s)to obtain the corrected mass 42 signal corresponding toreal nitrogen (14 N 28Si).NOTE 2: If mass 40 carbon ( 12C28Si) is defined = 1, mass 42( 12C30Si + 13C29Si) = 0.0335 + 0.0006 = 0.0341.NOTE 3: A hydride correction should be negligible for H onthe order of 1019 atoms/cm3 or less. 12.16 If the boron concentration is at or greater than 1 10 17/cm3, subtract 0.0583 times the mass 39 signalfrom the carbon correction to correct for the boroninterference.NOTE 4: The mass 39 boron ( 11B28Si + 10B29Si) is defined =1, and mass 40 (11B29Si + 10B30Si) = 0.0583. 12.17 Calculate the bulk nitrogen concentration \[N\]and the background nitrogen concentration \[Nb\] foreach test specimen using Equations 5 and 6.12.18 Record the specimen identification. 13 Report13.1 Report the following information:13.2 The instrument used, the operator, and the date ofthe measurements,13.3 Identification of the test and calibrationspecimens,13.4 The bulk nitrogen concentration values for the testspecimens,13.5 The nitrogen instrumental background concentra-tion during the faster sputter rate, and13.6 Whether anomalous nitrogen spikes were present,and if so, whether the averaging included or excludedthese spikes. 14 Precision and Bias14.1 The precision of the nitrogen determination hasnot yet been determined either by pilot study or byinterlaboratory test.14.2 There is no accepted reference material fordetermining the bias for the procedure in this testmethod.

SEMI MF2166-0304 © SEMI 20041 SEMI MF2166-0304PRACTICES FOR MONITORING NON-CONTACT DIELECTRICCHARACTERIZATION SYSTEMS THROUGH USE OF SPECIALREFERENCE WAFERS This standard was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication bythe North American Regional Standards Committee on October 16, 2003. Initially available atwww.semi.org February 2004; to be published March 2004. Originally published by ASTM International asASTM F 2166-02. Last previous edition SEMI MF2166-02.1 Purpose1.1 Non-contact dielectric characterization systems(NCDCS) that supply surface charge by means of acorona instead of an electrode are frequently used todetermine the oxide characteristics of MOS devicestructures. These instruments can measure a number ofcharacteristic parameters, including:1.1.1 initial surface voltage (Vsurf or Vcpd),1.1.2 flatband voltage (Vfb),1.1.3 effective charge (Q eff),1.1.4 density of interface traps (D it),1.1.5 mobile charge (Q m), and1.1.6 electrical dielectric thickness (T ox).1.2 To determine that the NCDCS is performingcorrectly, it is necessary to test the tester. This practiceprovides procedures for testing these systems with theuse of special reference wafers with specifiedcharacteristics.1.3 The procedures in these practices are designed toensure that the NCDCS being evaluated providesreliable data for selected device-related parameters.1.4 Flatband voltage is an important parameter in thefabrication of MOS devices. Its value is dependent onthe charge structure within and on the dielectric as wellas at the silicon-dielectric (Si-SiO 2) interface. Thesecharges consist of interface and bulk trapped and fixedcharge, mobile charge distributed within the dielectric,and charge residing on the top of the dielectric.Although the total charge in and on the oxidedetermines flatband voltage, the charge near the siliconhas the greatest effect.1.4.1 Most device applications require that the mobilecharge be minimized to provide stable thresholdvoltage. Stability of the charges at elevatedtemperatures is a measure of mobile charge densitywithin the dielectric. The mobile charge changeslocation under temperature and electric field stress.The mobile charge density can be calculated from theresulting change in flatband voltage. 1.4.2 Equipment used to produce dielectrics canbecome contaminated in various ways. When suchequipment becomes contaminated, it usually introducesan increased level of mobile ions into the dielectric.1.4.3 Measuring Vsurf or Vcpd, the contact potentialbetween the probe and the semiconductor, with aKelvin or Monroe probe allows a quantitativemeasurement of the charges associated with thesemiconductor surface and the dielectric, independentof top (contact) electrode variations as in MOS C-Vmeasurements. A special reference wafer has themobile ions confined to the top half of the dielectric. Itis therefore a good check of the Kelvin or Monroeprobe, which is most sensitive to charges near the top ofthe dielectric.1.5 The procedures in this practice can be used toascertain that the dielectric characterization system(s)meet quality control requirements. They can be used asa training tool for tester applications.1.6 The results obtained by these measurements canalso be used to expose and troubleshoot tester problemsincluding wafer handling and software issues. 2 Scope2.1 These practices describe the use of wafers withspecial electrical and physical characteristics forcontrolling and monitoring performance of non-contactdielectric characterization systems (NCDCS) thatemploy corona. They apply in general to dielectricswith charge structure that can be measured by thecharacterization system. Their applicability todielectrics of less than 3-nm electrical oxide thicknessdepends on the capability of the NCDCS. A thicknesscorrelation between the reference wafer(s) and thin-dielectric monitor wafers must be established.2.1.1 The reference wafers must be designed to checkthe repeatability and functionality of all the parts andsubsystems of the characterization system. Thermallyoxidized wafers are not sufficient for this purposebecause of parametric drift due to temperature-biasstressing and exposure to the atmosphere.

SEMI MF2166-0304 © SEMI 2004 2 2.2 Three methods are described to cover variousexperimental arrangements (see Related Information 1for a discussion on the two different types of corona).2.2.1 Method A  For systems that employ pointsource corona,2.2.2 Method B  For systems that employ line sourcecorona and can be programmed to obtain a full set ofparameters, and2.2.3 Method C  For systems that employ line sourcecorona but can only determine mobile ion density.2.3 For each of the three methods, the total testing timecan be reduced by using a short-cycle-timemodification.2.4 Special reference wafers are used to determineselected performance characteristics of these dielectriccharacterization systems, including initial surfacevoltage (Vsurf or Vcpd), flatband voltage (Vfb), effectivecharge (Q eff), density of interface traps (D it), mobilecharge (Q m), and electrical dielectric thickness (T ox).2.5 The parameters determined relate to the propertiesof the NCDCS subsystems in the following way:2.5.1 Vfb and Q eff data are used to check the surfacephotovoltage (SPV) probe, SPV strobe and coronabiasing subsystems, by monitoring behavioral changesthrough accumulation and around the flat bandcondition.2.5.2 D it data are used to check the same subsystems asin Section 2.5.1 , by monitoring behavioral changesthrough the depletion region of the Q bias vs SPV curve.2.5.3 Q m data are used to check the temperature-stresssubsystem, the corona subsystem, and the Kelvin orMonroe probe.2.5.4 T ox data are used to check the corona steppingand voltage bias and the Kelvin or Monroe probe air-gap setting.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 The presence of light on the wafer surface duringthe measurements can affect the results obtained andshould be controlled according to the systemmanufacturers recommendations.3.2 Relative humidity in the measurement environmentabove 60% may affect measurement values. 3.3 Stray electromagnetic fields external to theNCDCS may affect measurement results and should belimited according to the system manufacturersrecommendations.3.4 Wafer handling should be done in accordance withaccepted clean room practices, because surfacecontamination can affect the measurement results.3.5 Change in the characteristics of the specialreference wafers due to handling and other effects mayaffect measurement results. The special referencewafers must be checked at least once every six months,to assure consistent performance. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M20  Specification for Establishing a WaferCoordinate SystemSEMI MF1241  Terminology of Silicon TechnologyNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 General terms related to testing of semiconductormaterials may be found in SEMI MF1241.5.2 Definitions5.2.1 accumulation condition  the region of thecapacitance-voltage (C-V) curve for which a 5-Vincrement toward a more negative voltage for p-typematerial, or toward a more positive voltage for n-typematerial, results in a change of less than 1% in themaximum capacitance, Cmax.5.2.2 bias temperature stress, (BTS)  a voltageapplied to the top surface of a dielectric on a waferwhose temperature is maintained at a defined level for aspecified time.5.2.3 contact potential difference, (V cpd )  thepotential measured by a Kelvin or Monroe probe thatresults from the potential difference between twometals or between a semiconductor and a metal, due totheir difference in work function.

All CTS times must be at least 4minutes to allow full movement of the mobile ions.6.1.3 Three additional identical test sequences areexecuted to collect data to evaluate performance of theinstrument.NOTE 1: The bias, temperature and time used for the lastCTS prior to carrying out the above tests should be employedfor these test sequences.6.1.4 Performance of the NCDCS and its selectedcomponents is checked by measuring the followingcharacteristics: initial surface voltage (Vsurf), flatbandvoltage (Vfb), effective charge (Q eff), density of interfacetraps (D it), mobile charge (Qm), and electrical dielectricthickness (T ox).6.1.5 Measurements are made at three points on thesurface of the wafer and the mean, standard deviationand relative standard deviation of the results obtained inthe three identical sequences (Section 6.1.3 ) arecomputed and recorded.6.1.6 The results are compared with the valuessupplied with the special reference wafer to evaluate theNCDCS performance.6.1.7 If it is desired to check the system over its fullrange of operation, this procedure is repeated using twoor more additional special reference wafers withparameters that cover the typical parameter ranges inSection 7.4 .6.1.8 Short-cycle Time Modification of Method A The short-cycle time modification is performed in thesame manner except that the measurement of Q m iscarried out first, in order to assure consistent alignmentof the mobile ions prior to the other measurements.The Q m measurement is followed by the measurementof the other parameters. No repetitions are required; thetest sequence in this modification is only run once.6.2 Method B6.2.1 First any remaining residual charge on a specialreference wafer is neutralized by immersing it in DIwater.6.2.2 Then the special reference wafer is loaded intothe NSCDS and the surface voltage (contact potentialdifference) is zeroed to within ± 0.3 V.6.2.3 Then the steps in Sections 6.1.2 6.1.4 and 6.1.6are followed.6.2.4 If it is desired to check the system over its fullrange of operation, this procedure is repeated using twoor more additional special reference wafers with

&lt;!-- Page 41 --&gt;

SEMI MF2166-0304 © SEMI 2004 4 parameters that cover the typical parameter ranges inSection 7.4 .6.2.5 Short-cycle Time Modification of Method B The short-cycle time modification is performed in thesame manner except that the measurement of Q m iscarried out first, in order to assure consistent alignmentof the mobile ions prior to the other measurements.The Q m measurement is followed by the measurementof the other parameters. No repetitions are required; thetest sequence in this modification is only run once.6.3 Method C6.3.1 The steps in Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 arefollowed.6.3.2 Then a dummy mobile ion run is performed toposition the mobile ions into a consistent pre-testcondition.6.3.3 Then three additional mobile ion runs are madeand the average, standard deviation, and relativestandard deviation of the mobile ion density aredetermined.6.3.4 The results are compared with the mobile iondensity data supplied with the special reference wafer toevaluate the system performance.6.3.5 If it is desired to check the system over its fullrange of operation, this procedure is repeated using twoor more additional special reference wafers withparameters that cover the typical parameter ranges inSection 7.4 .6.3.6 Short-cycle Time Modification of Method C The short-cycle time modification is performed in thesame manner except that the first CTS time is 4 minand the second is 8 min. Only a single mobile ion runis carried out. 7 Special Reference Wafers7.1 Fabricate the special reference wafers (SRW) fromp-type silicon with a multi-layer dielectric including anembedded layer of mobile ions confined to the topportion of the dielectric. These mobile ions drift duringtemperature-bias stressing. Since the drift occurs onlyin the top of the dielectric, the Kelvin (Monroe) probeeasily senses a shift in Vsurf (Vcpd) for the mobile ionconcentration calculation. Confining the mobile ions tothe top of the dielectric also ensures that measurementsassociated with the silicon-dielectric interface are leftunchanged after the mobile ion test.7.2 Limit the thickness of the dielectric on the specialreference wafers to between 30 and 70 nm, to providesufficient distance for the mobile ions to drift whileremaining clear of the interface. 7.3 Ensure the dielectric is rugged enough so thatrepeated use, for example, once a day for six months, ofthe same test sites does not result in shifts in electricalparameters.7.3.1 Check parameter drift every 6 months. Parameterdrift over time should be less than 10% in six months.If drift exceeds this value, replace the special referencewafers.7.3.2 Test wafers must be re-calibrated anddocumented semi-annually by testing the wafers on twodocumented NCDCSs that have been maintained usingthis Practice. The results must match within 10%. Ifthe results exceed this value, replace the specialreference wafers.7.4 Test Parameter Ranges  p-type special referencewafers should have parameters appropriate for the testapplication. Parameters in the following ranges coverall anticipated applications of the SRWs.7.4.1 Vfb = 0.1 to 5.0 V,7.4.2 Q eff = 0.5 to 10  10 11 charge/cm2,7.4.3 Qm = 0.7 to 20  10 10 charge/cm2,7.4.4 Dit = 0.5 to 50  10 11 charge/cm2, and7.4.5 T ox = 30 to 200 nm.7.5 Supporting Data7.5.1 Data collected using the appropriate method shallbe supplied with each special reference wafer.7.5.2 Provide appropriate reference data for each waferon a data sheet similar to that in Figure 1 (Methods A orB) or Figure 2 (Method C).7.5.3 These values are the targets against which thesystem is evaluated.7.6 To determine the suitability of the system over itsrange of operation, select a set of at least three specialreference wafers with values of each parameter thatspan the ranges given in Section 7.4 . 8 Calibration Data Sheet8.1 A test plan shall be agreed upon among all partiesto the test. Data shall be recorded on a TestCertification Sheet similar to that supplied with thespecial reference wafers. Examples are shown inFigures 1 and 2. 9 Procedure9.1 Observe and record the temperature and relativehumidity of the room where the testing is taking place.9.2 Method A  for NCDCDs that employ a pointsource corona:9.2.1 Place a special reference wafer in the NCDCS.

Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on October 25, 2002. Initially available at www.semi.orgDecember 2002; to be published March 2003. Originally published in 1993; previously published in 1995. NOTICE: The users attention is called to thepossibility that compliance with this specification mayrequire use of an invention covered by patent rights.By publication of this specification, SEMI takes noposition respecting the validity of any patent rightsasserted in connection with any item mentioned in thisspecification. Users of this specification are expresslyadvised that determination of any such patent rights,and the risk of the infringement of such rights, areentirely their own responsibility.1 Scope1.1 This specification defines the content and locationof a back surface bar code marking for silicon wafers.The code is variable in length from 7 to 18 characterswhich are user-definable. A character position is heldconstant for the checksum character, but all else isvariable. No other information is encrypted into thecode. This allows the performance requirements ofrelated bar code reading equipment to be simplified. Inaddition, provision is made for an optionalalphanumeric marking of the size specified in SEMIM12 to enable operator identification of wafers. Thisalphanumeric code is not intended to be machinereadable.NOTE 1: The example as described in Table 1 and Figure 1pertains to a hard mark applied by the silicon wafermanufacturer.1.2 This specification applies to flatted or notchedsilicon wafers of nominal diameter 125 mm and larger,as specified in SEMI M1.1.3 The bar code can be read bi-directionally withoutimpairing its decodability.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 2 Referenced Standards2.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specifications for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI M12  Specification for Serial AlphanumericMarking of the Front Surface of Wafers NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 3 Terminology3.1 Definitions3.1.1 background  of a bar code symbol  theuniform lighter or more reflective region, includingquiet zones, that provides contrast for the darker bars.3.1.2 bar  in a bar code symbol  the darker or lessreflective element of the symbol.3.1.3 bar code density  the number of characters,exclusive of quiet zones, that can be represented in alinear unit of measure.NOTE 2: Bar code density can be expressed in characters perinch (cpi) or characters per millimeter (cpmm).3.1.4 bar code symbol  an array of rectangular barsand spaces that are arranged in a predetermined patternfollowing specific rules to represent elements of datathat are referred to as characters.NOTE 3: The symbol is comprised of message characters andstart/stop characters, check characters, and quiet zones asrequired by a particular symbology to form a completescannable entity.3.1.5 bar code character  a single group of bars andspaces which represent an individual number, letter,punctuation mark, or other symbol.3.1.6 bar height  of a bar code symbol  the bardimension perpendicular to the bar width.3.1.7 bar width  of a bar code symbol  theperpendicular distance across a bar between the pointson opposite edges that have a reflectance that ismidway between the background and bar reflectance.
