This assumption was validwhen the physical transport medium was based on a serial cable connection to the equipment. In such anenvironment, it is possible to ensure that only a single client application is permitted to interface with the equipmentby only providing the serial connection to the machine on which the application runs. consoleconsole Execute processprogram acknowledge Figure 1Equipment Communication via Serial Cable 8.2 As equipment communication moves from a serial cable medium to Ethernet, it becomes possible for any clienton the network to send requests to the equipment, provided there is a path from the client node to the equipment.Without taking specific measures to secure communication with the equipment, it is not possible to ensure that onlyauthorized clients are permitted to communicate with the equipment. consoleconsole Authorized Data CollectionRequest Unauthorized Data CollectionRequestFigure 2Equipment Communication via Ethernet 8.3 Even if the equipment accepts only a single connection request from the network, it is still vulnerable to a racecondition among any clients that attempt to connect. This results in a first-come, first-served policy in which thefirst client to attempt a connection with the equipment is granted access, even if that client is not authorized tocommunicate with that specific equipment. Such an environment is insufficient for providing adequate protection ofequipment resources.</p><p>&lt;<!-- -->!-- Page 2 --<!-- -->&gt;</p><p>SEMI E132-0305 © SEMI 2004, 20055 consoleconsole consoleconsoleconsoleconsole consoleconsole The HSMS-SS approach: only accept first connect request wrongclientrightclientwrongclientrightclient wrongclientrightclientwrongclientrightclient Right client attempts to connectfirst, is granted access Right client attempts to connectsecond, is denied access Figure 3First-come First-served Communication 8.4 A more secure technique to ensure that only authorized clients are allowed to utilize equipment resources is torequire clients to first prove their identity to the equipment. If the equipment knows a clients identity, then theequipment may be able to assume that the client is authorized to proceed with further requests. 9 Overview9.1 This standard defines a mechanism for clients of manufacturing equipment to authenticate to the equipment priorto any subsequent communication. To facilitate this, both the authentication procedure itself and a means forestablishing client identities with the equipment beforehand must be defined. This standard also defines a flexiblescheme for authorization and mechanisms to support a centralized administration model.9.2 Central Administration Model  A conceptual view of a central security administration model is presented inFigure 4 below. Credentials/Authorizations Mgmt Client Credentials/Authorizations Authenticate SecurityAdmin Equipment Client Authentication/Authorization Interface Credentials/Authorizations Mgmt Client Credentials/Authorizations Authenticate SecurityAdmin Equipment Client Authentication/Authorization Interface Figure 4Security Administration Model 9.2.1 Security Admin  The security admin issues client credentials, establishes client authorizations and possiblyclient credentials on the equipment, defines custom roles and their authorizations. Client credentials are identifyinginformation for the client. The security admin manages equipment authorizations and client credentials using anadministration interface defined in this specification. The interface between security admin and client to</p><p>&lt;<!-- -->!-- Page 3 --<!-- -->&gt;</p><p>SEMI E132-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 6 communicate the credentials will not be defined in this document, and may be as simple as configurations inside theclient application.9.2.2 Client  The client holds any issued credentials assigned to it, and authenticates to the equipment to establishan authenticated session.9.2.3 Equipment  The role of equipment in the administration model is to establish the security admin entity forthe equipment, hold any defined authorizations, authenticate clients to establish a session, determine clientauthorization levels and enforce them for the established session.9.2.4 Interfaces  The authentication, administration, and session establishment interfaces will be defined in latersections along with the concepts of establishing client identities and authorizations, though the actual technologyand protocols used maybe defined in further detail in a separate adjunct standard.9.3 Challenge/Response Authentication9.3.1 The authentication process begins when a client first attempts to establish a communication session with theequipment. Upon receiving this request, the equipment challenges the client to prove its identity to the equipment.The client must encrypt some session-generated data using a private or secret key (e.g. a password) that only theclaimed client would know. The equipment can verify clients claim using the corresponding public key or sharedsecret key assigned to the client to decrypt the data, if decrypted data matches plaintext then client is verified.9.3.2 For communication technologies in which a separate outgoing connection must be established in order for theequipment to send events, the equipment must also verify that the receiving address is valid. This is achieved bysending a ping message to the client endpoint (see Section 15.1.1). This specification currently does not define amechanism by which a client can transfer an established session to a different endpoint.9.4 Authorization9.4.1 Any client application wishing to invoke privileged services on the equipment must be authorized to do so.Authorization is implemented by granting access control privileges beforehand to defined clients and later checkedagainst the clients requests. The general operational flow is as follows: Authentication and Credentials Exchange  Client application authenticates to equipment as to its identity andestablishes an authenticated session. Session Established  Equipment optionally caches client applications privileges and associates theseprivileges with the newly-created session. Service Request  Client application makes a service request. Privilege Validation  Equipment validates the client applications request against its assigned privileges. Session Closed  Client application closes session, all session state information are reset or cleaned.9.4.2 Since the client does not authenticate itself for each service request, privilege validation is performed againstthe authenticated session created for that client. This does not necessarily mean that the implementation of a sessionrequires the use of a stateful or connection-oriented communication protocol, or that authentication must beperformed during every protocol-level reconnect. If the implementation protocol is connectionless, the session canbe identified by some mutually agreed upon session identifier, negotiated during the authentication process requiredto establish a session.NOTE 2: This specification does not define a mechanism for controlling end-user access to equipment services or information.The authentication and authorization scheme defined in this specification applies at the application level only. Management ofend-user access to equipment functions and information is strictly the responsibility of applications that make use of theauthenticated communication sessions defined in this specification. 10 Authentication10.1 Authentication Message Flow  The authentication message flow during a normal session establishment ispresented in Figure 5. Arrows represent the major messages exchanged during the handshake, with side notesclarifying the key data exchanged in each message. Depending on the actual messaging/transport protocols andencryption algorithms used, some additional messages or data parameters may be added, but the concept remains the</p><p>&lt;<!-- -->!-- Page 4 --<!-- -->&gt;</p><p>SEMI E132-0305 © SEMI 2004, 20057 same. Specifics of algorithms and protocols will be detailed in a separate technology mapping specification. Theterms server and equipment are used interchangeably.10.1.1 Session Request  This message requests the equipment to initiate establishment of an authenticated session.Upon receiving this message, the equipment begins the authentication handshake as shown in Figure 5. If therequest is not accepted, the equipment responds with a protocol specific alert or error message and terminates theconnection, see Equipment Challenge.10.1.2 Equipment Challenge  After the session request is accepted, the equipment responds with a challenge. Theequipment selects the algorithms to be used for authentication (if applicable), provides its own identification andchallenges the client to authenticate itself. The challenge can be a simple request to client to prove its identity. Notethat errors can be returned instead of the normal parameters. Additional errors may be needed as required by theimplementation protocol used to support the concepts.10.1.3 Client Authenticate  The client responds to the server challenge, confirming the algorithms selected (ifapplicable), equipments identification and also presents proof of clients own identity. The proof is typically a hashof some random data encrypted with a key that only the client would know and that the server can verify. A secretunique to the authentication protocol may also be generated by the client and sent to equipment in the response.Actual algorithms used for exchange of this secret will be defined by the specific authentication protocol specified inthe adjunct standard.

The acknowledgement contains a parameter that can be a hash of the secretor its derived secret. The derivation algorithm for derived session secret is known both to the equipment and theclient, and is part of the protocol specification. This allows client to verify the exchange by verifying the hash.Subsequent communication over the session will make use of the derived secret keys. Note that this standard doesnot require data be encrypted over the established session, the derived secret is only used to identify the session andhence the authorizations of the authenticated client. Additional errors may be defined as required by the protocolchosen, and technology used by the implementations.Table 7 Equipment ACK Argument DefinitionsParameter Description Kind FormACK Hash of data derived from the exchanged session secret, this provesequipments correct decryption of the secret.

The identifier will be embedded in special headers inthe message transport, and not as formal parameters in the communication messages thus preserving their originalstructure as defined by the respective interface specifications.</p><p>&lt;<!-- -->!-- Page 6 --<!-- -->&gt;</p><p>SEMI E132-0305 © SEMI 2004, 20059 11 Authorization11.1 Authorization Overview11.1.1 Any client wishing to invoke privileged services on the equipment must be authorized to do so.Authorization is implemented by granting access control privileges beforehand to defined clients and later checkedagainst the clients requests. The total set of available privileges may include standardized service-level accesscontrol, such as privileges to invoke specific services or functions, but may also include supplier-defined finer-grained privileges. A default privilege to allow access to all services available from an authenticated session isdefined in this specification, and must be supported by all implementations. A user of the equipment therefore hasthe option to reduce security enforcement on the equipment to authentication alone, achieved by assigning this all-access privilege to all defined clients.11.1.2 Figure 6 provides an abstract overview of the relationships among the Role, Principal, and Privilege conceptsdefined in this specification. A Principal is either assigned to one and only one Role, or to one or more Privileges.A Role is defined as a uniquely-identifiable set of 1 or more Privileges, and cannot be composed from other Roles.Zero or more Principals can be assigned to at most one Role. These relationships are enforced through themanagement of Access Control List entries, described in Section 11.2.

A principal can have privileges granted to it through either an explicit list of privileges, orindirectly through assignment to a role. The equipment shall maintain the ACL defined in this specification in non-volatile memory.11.2.2 Roles are used to simplify the management of privilege assignments to principals. Each unique role has anACL entry that specifies the privileges assigned to that role. Those privileges can then be granted to principalsthrough a RoleAssignment ACL entry for each principal that should have those privileges. A principal must eitherhave a RoleAssignment or an explicit list of privileges assigned to it (PrivilegeAssignment); it is not permitted tohave both.11.2.3 The equipment shall refuse session requests from clients that have no ACLEntry, either explicitly through arole or privilege assignment, or implicitly through the existence of an ACLEntry for all authenticated principals.</p><p>&lt;<!-- -->!-- Page 7 --<!-- -->&gt;</p><p>SEMI E132-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 10 idSubject privilegeIdPrivilege ACLEntry Principal Role subject 11 PrivilegeAssignment RoleAssignment privileges11..<!-- -->*<!-- --> principal 1 1 role1 1 Figure 7ACL Entry Description 11.2.4 ACLEntry11.2.4.1 Figure 7 shows the classes used for requesting the creation of a new ACLEntry on the equipment (seeSection 12.3.2.3). The ACLEntry is an abstract base class for the two kinds of ACL entries, PrivilegeAssignment,and RoleAssignment. There can be only one ACLEntry for each subject. Attempts to add a second entry for samesubject shall generate a duplicate entry error (see Section 12.3.2.3). This class has no attributes or associations.11.2.5 PrivilegeAssignment11.2.5.1 This class defines an association between a given subject (either a Principal or a Role) and its set ofassigned privileges on the equipment. A PrivilegeAssignment for a Principal establishes all privileges that arespecifically granted to the Principal. A given Principal must either have a PrivilegeAssignment ACLEntry or aRoleAssignment ACLEntry (see Section 11.2.6); it cannot have one (or more) of each. A PrivilegeAssignment for aRole defines the role itself and the privileges that will be granted to any Principal that is assigned to that Role (seeSection 11.2.6). There can be only one PrivilegeAssignment ACLEntry for a given Role.Table 8 PrivilegeAssignment Association DefinitionsAssociation Role Name Definition Commentssubject The Principal or Role that is being granted privileges.

The id is a text field that identifies a particular Subject. If the Subject is aPrincipal, then the id is equal to that Principals unique id used during authentication. If the Subject is a Role, thenthe id is equal to the name of the Role.Table 10 Subject Attribute DefinitionsAttribute Name Definition Formid Identifies a Principal or Role. Text. 11.2.8 Principal11.2.8.1 This class represents a specific Principal that can be authenticated and assigned privileges. Thisspecification defines a reserved Principal id that represents any Principal that successfully authenticates to theequipment. The value of the id for this reserved Principal is urn:semi-org:auth:anyPrincipal. All implementationsshall support this reserved Principal. If an equipment users security policy permits the approach, aPrivilegeAssignment or RoleAssignment ACL entry can be created for the reserved Principal to assign a default setof privileges to any client that successfully authenticates, rather than creating an ACL entry for each Principal.11.2.8.2 Each client that attempts to authenticate to the equipment must have an id that matches the id of onePrivilegeAssignment or RoleAssignment ACLEntry for that Principal, or else there must be onePrivilegeAssignment or RoleAssignment ACLEntry for the reserved anyPrincipal. If there are no such entries forthe authenticating client, the equipment shall reject the session request. If there is a PrivilegeAssignment orRoleAssignment ACLEntry for both the specific Principal and the reserved anyPrincipal, the equipment shallaccept the session request, and shall grant only those privileges assigned to the specific Principal to the session.Privileges assigned to the reserved anyPrincipal shall not be granted to such sessions.11.2.9 Role11.2.9.1 This class represents a Role that can be assigned privileges. Roles can simplify the assignment ofprivileges to Principals. This is achieved by creating a single PrivilegeAssignment ACL entry for the Rolecontaining the appropriate privileges, and then assigning each Principal (or the reserved anyPrincipal) to that Roleusing a RoleAssignment ACL entry.11.2.10 Privilege11.2.10.1 This class represents a specific privilege that can be granted to subjects as part of an ACL entry. Alldefined privileges supported by the equipment can be obtained using the GetDefinedPrivileges operation of theSecurityAdmin interface. How each privilege is applied to a subject is determined by the specification or equipmentsupplier that defines the privilege. The privilege id is a text field that identifies a particular privilege and must be</p><p>&lt;<!-- -->!-- Page 9 --<!-- -->&gt;</p><p>SEMI E132-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 12 unique across all privileges defined on the equipment. Permission and privilege is used interchangeably in thisspecification.11.2.10.2 This specification defines a reserved Privilege id that represents all Privileges that are supported by theequipment. The value of the id for this reserved Privilege is urn:semi-org:auth:allPrivileges. All implementationsshall support this reserved Privilege. If an equipment users security policy permits the approach, an ACL entry canbe created for any Principal or Role that assigns this reserved Privilege to that Principal or Role. Principals or Rolesthat are assigned this privilege are granted all privileges supported by the equipment. A PrivilegeAssignment ACLentry containing this privilege cannot include any other privileges supported by the equipment in the entry.Table 11 Privilege Attribute DefinitionsAttribute Name Definition FormprivilegeId Identifies a specific privilege. Text, must be equal to either the reserved value urn:semi-org:auth:allPrivileges, or to the id attribute of one of theDefinedPrivileges supported by the equipment (see Section Table 21). 11.2.10.3 This specification also defines a reserved Privilege id that represents the Privileges of the SecurityAdminas described in 12.2. The value of the id for this reserved Privilege is urn:semi-org.auth:securityAdminPrivileges.All implementations shall support this reserved Privilege. One and only one Principal can be assigned this privilege,either through a RoleAssignment or PrivilegeAssignment ACLentry. Once assigned, that Principal is permittedaccess to all operations defined for the SecurityAdmin interface. Requests to create more than one ACLEntryassigning this privilege to a Principal shall be rejected (see Section 12.3.2.3). 12 Administration12.1 Administration Overview12.1.1 As the number of clients and resources to manage across a factory scales up, support for a centralized securityadministration model becomes a critical capability. This specification will not describe how a factory canimplement such a model for their network, but will specify standard mechanisms to enable this capability. Thisspecification describes a security administration interface to allow remote management of client credentials andauthorizations, such as from a central location. Only concepts and behavior are described, it is expected that aseparate technology adjunct standard will be created describing the specific message structure, protocols andalgorithms that will used.12.2 Security Admin12.2.1 The equipment must support one security administration account. This admin agent will have privileges toutilize the SecurityAdmin interface defined in this specification. The initial security admin credentials must beestablished at the time of equipment install via some out of band means, this can be a local operator interface orprovided by equipment vendor as a factory preset. If the admin credentials are factory preset, then there must besome means for end-user to re-establish its credentials. This specification requires that only the security admin canutilize the services defined in the security administration interface. Security admin privileges are granted to one andonly one Principal via a reserved privilege id.

EstablishSession includes the clients end point (if necessary) forequipment notifications (see Section 13.2.6). Upon receiving the request, the equipment determines if theauthenticated client has a corresponding ACLEntry. If so, a new session is created for the client if possible (seeSection 13.2.6), and generates a unique session identifier for it. The session identifier is returned to the client in theEstablishSession response for use in subsequent requests. Every session established on the equipment hasassociated with it a unique session identifier, the clients id, and end point address. Once established, the session isgranted the Privileges assigned to the client based on the corresponding ACLEntry for that client (Principal).Changes to the ACL do not affect the Privileges of sessions established prior to the change..13.1.3 Service Request and Response  Service requests, as defined by any interface specification that requiresauthenticated communications and authorization, are made. The unique session identifier required for authorizationis carried in reserved session headers within the implementation protocol (see Section 10.2).13.1.4 Close Session  Request by a client to terminate an authenticated session. Upon receiving this request, theequipment clears all context information related to that session, including closing any existing, active connection,and terminating any activities initiated by the client during the session.13.2 SessionManager Interface13.2.1 The equipment shall implement the session management operations defined in this section. These operationsare accessible to any client after an authenticated session is established, including the security admin.

RR Client EquipmentEstablishSession Request to establish a new authenticated session and to setclient end point.RR Client Equipment 13.2.3 PersistSession  Upon receiving this request, if the client is requesting that the session be persisted, theequipment shall store the clients current session context including the session identifier, any client endpointaddressing information, and session privileges to non-volatile memory. Once the session has been persisted, itremains active across equipment shutdowns, reactivating as soon as the equipment is in a state where it can supportexternal communications. Persistent sessions can still be terminated if the equipment determines that the client isunreachable. For further details, see the Session Monitoring state of Session State Model, defined in Section14.3.2.7. See session state transitions (Table 30) into and out of the Frozen state for required behavior on freezingand resuming persistent sessions.

The state models representclients view of the equipments state, not necessarily the actual equipments internal operations. No transitions inthese state models are to be made available for event reporting.14.2 Session Establishment State Model  The session establishment state model defines the behavior of theequipment for establishment of authenticated sessions over this interface. It defines the equipments management ofauthenticated sessions overall during startup and shutdown. For definition of individual session behaviors, seeSection 14.3. DISALLOWED 1 ALLOWED2 Session Establishment 3 Figure 15Session Establishment State Diagram 14.2.1 Session Establishment States14.2.1.1 DISALLOWED  This state is active when the equipment is shutting down, either as part of an orderlyshutdown or an emergency power-off. While in this state, any requests for new authenticated sessions (if it ispossible to receive them) are rejected and all active sessions have been closed or FROZEN (Section 14.3.2.9). In thecase of an emergency shutdown, all active sessions may be dropped abruptly and notifications to clients may not bepossible. In this case, persistent sessions shall still be resumed on startup since their state is saved to non-volatilestorage.</p><p>&lt;<!-- -->!-- Page 19 --<!-- -->&gt;</p><p>SEMI E132-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 22 14.2.1.2 ALLOWED  Establishment of authenticated sessions is allowed.

Session is active beginningwith a successful request to establish a new session, and is active until the session is closed.14.3.2.2 AUTHENTICATING  This state is where the client and the equipment carry out the authenticationprocess and establish new authenticated sessions. Privileges are granted to the session once the client isauthenticated and the session successfully established. See Section 10 for the authentication message flow, andSection 13.2.6 for session establishment.14.3.2.3 ESTABLISHED  This state is the parent of all those sub-states that relate to service invocation andcommunications subsequent to successful authentication and session establishment. It has two simultaneous sub-states, COMMUNICATING and MONITORING, both of which are active whenever the session isESTABLISHED.14.3.2.4 COMMUNICATING (ESTABLISHED Sub-State)  This is the ESTABLISHED sub-state where all sessioncommunications are handled.14.3.2.5 MONITORING (ESTABLISHED Sub-State)  This state provides a watchdog mechanism to monitor statusof the established session.14.3.2.6 READY (COMMUNICATING Sub-State)  Initial state upon session established and COMMUNICATINGstate becomes active. Both the client and the equipment have been successfully authenticated without errors. Theequipment is awaiting service requests in this state and can report relevant events to authenticated clients. Exceptfor the services defined in this specification, the services allowed or events reported are dependent on thespecifications that defined them.14.3.2.7 SESSION MONITOR (MONITORING Sub-State)  Initial state upon entry to ESTABLISHED state andwhen MONITORING becomes active. The equipment shall periodically check the active status of the session bysending ping messages to the client. See Section 15.1.1for details of the SessionPing message. A ping message issent upon first entry to the state. When resuming persistent sessions during equipment startup, the ping messagetells client of each persistent session that the equipment is now online. The interval at which the next ping messageis sent, and the number of attempts to be made before closing a session shall be configurable, and must include away to disable periodic pings (such as by using a delay interval of zero). If the client does not respond after theconfigured number of pings, the equipment shall terminate the session automatically. The default number of pingattempts shall be set to 3.14.3.2.8 CLOSING  Session is being terminated either at request of client, security admin, or equipment initiateddue to errors. Session context are cleared including established session identifier. A SessionClosed (section 15.1.3)notification is sent to client (if possible) on transition to this state.14.3.2.9 FROZEN  A persistent session is put on hold as the equipment is powered down or in a state where it isnot able to communicate. A SessionFrozen (section 15.1.2) notificatication is sent to client (if possible) ontransition to this state. When resuming a persistent session, behavior is governed by re-entry to the ESTABLISHEDstate and its sub-states.14.3.3 Session State TransitionsTable 34 Session State Transitions Table # Current State Trigger New State Actions Comments1 (no state) Client request to startan authenticatedsession AUTHENTICATING Equipment and clientbegins authentication andsession establishmentmessage flow (see Sections10 and 14.3.2.2).</p><p>&lt;<!-- -->!-- Page 21 --<!-- -->&gt;</p><p>SEMI E132-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 24 # Current State Trigger New State Actions Comments2 AUTHENTICATING Client or equipmentfailed to authenticate,an error occurredduring the process, orthe client has nocorrespondingACLEntry.

provide an authentication implementation using SSL and aWSDL/SOAP implementation and XML Schema that corresponds to the UML model for Equipment ClientAuthentication and Authorization as defined by SEMI E132. 2 Scope2.1 Specification Scope2.1.1 The scope of this document is the faithful representation of the ECA model in an XML schema andcorresponding WSDL services. It will not add new domain information or concepts to the model. The onlyadditions made are those needed to render useful WSDL or XML Schema.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Provisional Specification3.1.1 This specification is provisional pending the approval of SEMI E138. This specification relies on XMLSchema types defined in Core Components, and cannot be fully implemented without these types. Finalization ofthat specification is a condition for the removal of the provisional status of this document. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E121  Guide for Style &amp; Usage of XML for

E132.1-0305 © SEMI 2005 6 5.2.2 XML (eXtensible Markup Language)  a markup language used for representing data rich with context andcontent in documents and in communications. XML is an extension of SGML, a document-oriented markuplanguage. It was created by W3C for use on the Internet. 6 Conventions6.1 Translating UML to XML Schema6.1.1 The reader is expected to have a working knowledge of the UML, XML, and Schema specifications (See4.2 and 4.3). This document does not provide tutorial information on these subjects.6.1.2 This document follows the guidelines for XML as outlined in SEMI E121.6.1.3 Some of the key guidelines followed in this document are summarized here: Attributes of UML classes are generally represented as XML attributes, to improve efficiency in transferringmetadata descriptions from the equipment. Exceptions to this convention are UML attributes that correspond todata structures or other constructs that cannot be represented as XML attributes, or may include text values thatmay need to include non-parsed character data (CDATA). Composition associations are mapped to a single XML element (or multiple such elements if the specifiedmultiplicity is greater than 1). Aggregations are modeled as contained elements or arrays of references to one or more unique attributes of thetarget type. Inheritance is modeled using complexType extension. In cases where a reference to an abstract base classoccurs in the UML model, a choice compositor for each of the possible derived types is used in order to restrictinstance documents from including arbitrary extension through type substitution.6.1.4 The translation of a UML class to XML Schema types is documented using a table format illustrated by Table1. Operations defined for a UML class are translated into WSDL operations.6.1.5 Translation Table Column Header Description Attribute or Role Name  If an attribute, the name of the attribute is placed here. If an association (includingaggregation or composition), the role name from the UML diagram is placed here. Compositions are often notassigned roll names. In that case none is placed here. UML Name/Type  If an attribute, the data type of the UML attribute is place here. If an association, the typeof association is placed here. The possible types are Composition, Aggregation, or the basic Association.UML defines these three types of association. XML Element or Attribute  Lists the type of XML construct used to represent the UML attribute orassociation. XML Name/Type  Provides the name and data type of the resulting XML construct. The type may be a built-in type (for example, xs:string), or a named type defined within the XML Schema.Table 1 Example Translation Table Attribute or Role Name UML Name/Type XML Element or Attribute XML Name/Typefriend association element Friend: HumanReferenceArrayemployees aggregation element Employees: HumanArrayfamily composition element Family: HumanArrayname string element Name: xs:string 6.1.6 Translating Operations to XML Schema6.1.6.1 The translation of an operation defined for UML interface classes to XML Schema types is documentedusing a table format illustrated in Table 2.

Although no standard graphicalnotation for XML could be found, various XML tools have their own notation. This document will use the notationprovided by XMLSpy from Altova Corporation. Figure 1 shows a sample XML diagram that will be used toprovide a basis for explanation of the XML graphical notation used in the rest of the document.6.3.2 In the diagram, rectangular boxes represent XML elements. Ownership or containment is read from right toleft in the diagrams. In the sample diagram, ParentType contains Child1, Child2, Child 3, and Child 4. In turn,Child2 contains Child2a, Child2b, and Child2c. The additional symbols (8-sided boxes) represent sequences orchoices. See Table 4 for an explanation of these symbols.Table 4 Altova XMLSPY Schema Diagram SymbolsDenotes a required ordered sequence of the right hand elements with a cardinality of onefor each element (sequence).Denotes an optional ordered sequence of the right hand elements with a cardinality ofone for each element (sequence).Denotes a required, but unordered, sequence of the right hand elements with acardinality of one for each element (all).Denotes a required choice of the right hand elements. Exactly one or two of the righthand elements must be present (choice). Denotes an element that contains parsed character data.Denotes a reference to a group or element defined elsewhere. 6.3.3 A graphic using a solid line is a required element; using a dashed line represents an optional element.Numbers or ranges in the lower right hand corner represent cardinality. The default cardinality is one. 3 All images/graphics were created using Altovas XMLSPY®.

The 8-sided symbols have asmall square on the right end. If a minus sign - is in the box, then all detail is shown. If the box contains a plussign +, then all detail to the right of that symbol is hidden. The example has no hidden detail.6.3.5 The yellow (or grey if printed in monochrome) boxes indicate the use of other defined types. So, Child4 is oftype Child4Type. Child4Type defines Child4a and Child4b. This detail may be hidden in the diagram. Objectoriented inheritance is typically represented in XML as type extension. In Figure 1, ParentType extendsChild1and2Type by adding a sequence that includes Child3 and Child4.6.3.6 Reading Figure 1 would yield the following additional information:1. Child1and2Type is an ordered sequence of two items: Child2 and Child1.2. Child1 contains an optional ordered sequence of Child1a, one or more Child1b, and (optionally) Child1c.3. Child2 contains a choice of one or two of the following: Child2a, Child2b, and Child2c.4. Child3 contains an unordered sequence of Child3a and Child3b.6.4 XML Schema Sample6.4.1 The sample XML Schema for the example shown in Figure 1, is presented below.

This specification defines several restrictions on the capabilities of SSL to theminimum necessary to support SEMI E132 authentication. These restrictions are described in more detail in thefollowing section.7.1.3 SEMI E132 Restrictions on SSL7.1.3.1 X.509 v3 public key certificates as defined by RFC 2459 must be used to establish equipment and clientidentities, see X.509 documentation referenced in 4.4 for complete details of X.509 structure and content. Thecertificate is sent when required during the SSL handshake.7.1.3.2 Mutual authentication is required. Equipment shall always send its certificate and request for the clientscertificate as part of the SSL handshake. Correspondingly, client will send its own certificate and the certificateverify message to equipment to allow client authentication.</p><p>&lt;<!-- -->!-- Page 34 --<!-- -->&gt;</p><p>SEMI E132.1-0305 © SEMI 200511 Client Equipment ClientHello ServerHello Certificate CertificateRequest Certificate ClientKeyExchange CertificateVerify ChangeCipherSpec ServerHelloDone Server public key certificate Key Parameters:session idserver random dataselected algorithms Key Parameters:protocol versionclient random datasupported algorithms Client public key certificate session secret encryptedwith server&#x27;s public Key Client signatureChangeCipherSpec Finished Finished Sent under new algorithms Sent under new algorithms Session Request Equipment Challenge Client Authenticate Equipment ACK Figure 3SSL Basic Handshake Flow 7.2 Credentials and Digital Certificates7.2.1 Overview7.2.1.1 X.509 certificates shall be used to establish identities for equipment and application clients.

Authorization management,ACL Entry and Security Admin are as defined in SEMI E132, see Authorizations section.</p><p>&lt;<!-- -->!-- Page 35 --<!-- -->&gt;</p><p>SEMI E132.1-0305 © SEMI 2005 12 ID Public/Private KeyPrivileges X.509 CertificateE132 ACL EntryE132 Principal Id = ID Certificate Subject Name:Common Name=ID SecurityAdmin CA Admin Authority Admin AuthorityID Public/Private KeyPrivileges X.509 CertificateE132 ACL EntryE132 Principal Id = ID Certificate Subject Name:Common Name=ID SecurityAdmin CA Admin Authority Admin Authority Figure 4SEMI E132.1 Security Credentials 7.2.1.2 CA is the Certification Authority that issues certificates to equipment and application clients wishing tocommunicate over SSL. The authenticity of the certificate is verified by the CA signature within the certificate, ineffect the CA is certifying the validity of the information contained in the certificate, more importantly it certifiesthe binding between the entity identified in the certificate and its public key used for authentication purposes in SSL.For more information on certificate validation and signature verification, please see referenced X.509 v3documentation in 4.4. The CA may or may not be the same as the Security Admin as defined in SEMI E132,which manages access control permissions for application clients. Implementation and maintenance of both the CAand the Security Admin are the responsibility of the equipment user, including certificate issuance and securitycredentials management. Equipment suppliers shall not be required to provide CA or Security Adminimplementations.7.2.1.3 In this specification, only the common name (CN) attribute of the certificates subject distinguished name(DN) is required, this is represented as ID in Figure 4. The same ID must be used by the Security Admin whenbinding authorizations to a principal id in an ACLEntry. In summary, SEMI E132 principals are identified by thecommon name (CN) attribute of the subject distinguished name field of the certificate issued to the principal.7.2.1.4 Certificates issued by the CA for SEMI E132 shall be encoded in PKCS#12 format along withcorresponding private keys. Equipment shall support PKCS#12 to decode certificate and any associated private keyissued by the CA. There are no restrictions on the local encoding format of certificates. See PKCS#12documentation referenced in 4.4 for complete details. The CA certificate will also be delivered in same format butwithout the private key. The CA certificate is used by SSL for certificate verification.7.2.1.5 Certificates must minimally support signing capability if the KeyUsage extension field is present in thecertificate, more specifically the digitalSignature bit must be asserted. Please see the X.509 v3 specification formore information on certificate profile.7.2.2 Establishing Equipment Credentials7.2.2.1 Equipment must install both the CAs public certificate and its own certificate along with the correspondingprivate key, the CA certificate to verify client certificates are from the same trusted CA. Equipment is responsiblefor decoding the PKCS#12 encoded certificates and private key from CA to a format supported by itsimplementation.7.2.2.2 An ACLEntry defining the Security Admin for the equipment must be added using the local equipmentinterface. This shall be done at time of equipment install to allow remote administration of access permissions forthe equipment.7.2.3 Establishing Application Credentials7.2.3.1 Application clients wishing to establish SEMI E132 sessions with any equipment must first possess a validcertificate issued by the CA prior to any communications. Equipment shall ensure SSL handshake terminates forany client that does not present a valid certificate issued by a trusted CA. Similar to equipment certificates, all clientcertificates and corresponding private key from CA will be encoded in PKCS#12 format. The CA certificate mustalso be installed by the application client to verify equipment certificate chain.</p><p>&lt;<!-- -->!-- Page 36 --<!-- -->&gt;</p><p>SEMI E132.1-0305 © SEMI 200513 7.2.3.2 Each client must also have an ACLEntry defined on the equipment granting the appropriate privileges tosupport its functions prior to establishing SEMI E132 sessions with the equipment. This can be done via theSecurity Admin or via the equipment console.7.2.3.3 Equipment shall reject all SEMI E132 establish session requests if client does not have an ACLEntrydefined, even if client possesses a valid certificate issued by trusted CA.7.3 Enabling/Disabling SSL Authentication7.3.1 There may be some integration, development, and/or test environments in which it is not practical or feasibleto install equipment and/or client certificates in order to communicate with the equipment. As a practicalconsideration for such environments only, the equipment shall support the ability of the user to enable or disableSSL authentication at the equipment.7.3.2 If enabled, all SEMI E132-based communication with the equipment shall take place via mutually-authenticated SSL as described in 7.1.7.3.3 If disabled, all SEMI E132-based communication with the equipment shall take place via the normal,unauthenticated HTTP transport. While disabled, requests shall still follow the normal authorization verificationsusing the client ID provided in the FROM field of the SEMI E132 header; however, because requests are notauthenticated there can be no guarantee that the requesting application is authentic. Users should be aware thatdisabling SSL authentication provides unrestricted access to all SEMI E132 equipment operations for anyapplication (factory authorized or not) with network access to the equipment.7.3.4 Equipment shall provide a configuration option to allow switching between SSL and non-SSLcommunications. Only one such communication port shall be active at any time. During a configuration change, itis the responsibility of the equipment user to close existing sessions prior to the change, as the active port will nolonger be available for requests following the change, and clients will not be notified of the change by theequipment.7.3.5 After a configuration change, any pre-existing persistent sessions shall remain active as defined in the SEMIE132 Session State Model. Users should be aware that all requests made by those sessions after the change musttake place on the new port. The equipment is not required to retain non-persistent sessions in the active statefollowing a configuration change. If an equipment reset is required to change this configuration, then persistentsessions shall be resumed, and non-persistent sessions shall be closed as for any equipment shutdown as defined inthe SEMI E132 Session State Model. 8 Mapping of SEMI E132 UML to XML Schema and WSDL8.1 WSDL Organization8.1.1 Each interface definition in SEMI E132 is mapped to a WSDL portType and binding definition. WSDLportType definitions are named after the interface and its operations as they appear in SEMI E132. WSDL bindingdefinitions for each portType are used to specify the SOAP 1.1 envelope contents for each operation, and to definethe corresponding XML encoding styles and HTTP header usage. All SEMI E132 WSDL interfaces usedocument/literal encoding, with the complete SOAP header and body contents defined in XML Schema file(s) viaglobal element definitions.8.1.2 Figure 5 shows the relationship between the WSDL binding and portType definitions and the XML Schematypes used for each interface. The portType definition imports XML Schema type definitions used in each operationvia the XML Schema import statement.

The contents ofthese documents constitute the core part of this specification.8.2.3 WSDL Port Type Overview8.2.3.1 The SecurityAdmin WSDL portType definition organizes the SEMI E132.1 XML Schema data types into acollection of named operations with inputs and outputs that correspond to the UML operations that are defined forthe SecurityAdmin interface in SEMI E132. The WSDL portType itself is named after the SEMI E132 interface,and each WSDL portType operation is named after the corresponding UML operation defined for the interface.Each WSDL operation consists of two WSDL message definitions corresponding to the input and output (requestand response) for the UML operation defined in SEMI E132. Figure 7 illustrates the relationship between the SEMIE132 UML interface and the WSDL portType definition; Table 12 describes this in tabular form. The WSDLmessage and operation definitions are described in 8.2.9 through 8.2.15.

Thesesettings are shown in Table 13. For each WSDL portType operation, the binding defines any SOAP headers usedand whether or not they are required, the HTTP SOAPAction header value to use for that operation, and the XMLencoding to use (literal for SEMI E132.1).

WSDL service definitions provide one wayto define and locate the endpoint(s) at which a given interface can be accessed by a client. Such information cannotbe determined until the equipment has been installed on a factory network, and therefore is out of scope for thisspecification. Users are responsible for defining the mechanisms by which clients locate SEMI E132 equipmentservices in the factory.

The commonerror is in addition to any custom error construct that may be defined by each operation to provide additional contextrelevant to the operation and a specific error. The common error type defines 2 attributes, source and code; seeCommon Components Specification for more detailed information. All E132 defined errors shall set the sourceattribute to urn:semi-org:E132. The error codes for SEMI E132 defined errors are provided in Table 14.Description is a textual description of the error. The Extension element allows equipment suppliers to provide moredetailed information regarding the error using XML content defined by the supplier.8.2.6.1.2 Table 14 below provides a mapping of the SEMI E132 defined errors to its common error code. TheSEMI E132 Error column matches the error description of each defined error in the SEMI E132 specification. Errorsduring the Authentication message exchange are as defined by the SSL authentication protocol. The SEMI E132mapped error codes below are in addition to any common error codes defined in the Common ComponentsSpecification.Table 14 SEMI E132 Error CodesSEMI E132 Error Common Error CodeOperation not authorized 6000Duplicate ACL entry found 6001Unrecognized role 6002Unrecognized privilege 6003ACL entry not found 6004Unrecognized session 6005Max session limit exceeded 6006 8.2.6.2 Unauthorized Operation Error8.2.6.2.1.1 Many operations may return an operation not authorized error (common error code 6000). For thiserror, SEMI E132 defines a specific UnauthorizedOperationError structure to provide additional context informationsuch as list of all the privileges that grant authorization for the requested operation.8.2.6.2.1.2 The UnauthorizedOperationError class is mapped to the XML UnauthorizedOperationType.

The session identifier is generated by the equipment during the Establish Session operation,and must be a UUID that is guaranteed unique across space and time, see documentation referenced in 4.4 forspecific details on syntax and format of a UUID.8.2.7.2 In this specification, a header type is defined in the XML Schema file to carry the SEMI E132 sessionidentifier within the SOAP header for SOAP messages defined for this interface. This provides the most transparentway of sending the session identifier without affecting the input/output parameters of the individual operations.Since SEMI E132 requires all requests to the equipment to be sent over SSL, the session identifier need not beencrypted and shall be included in the header unmodified. Figure 10 shows the XML schema diagram for theE132Header schema element. The session identifier is modeled as the SessionID of XML type xsd:string in theE132Header. Figure 10E132Header XML Schema Element 8.2.7.3 The WSDL message E132HeaderMessage defines the message used in the SOAP header. It maps to theschema element E132Header as described above, see definitions of E132HeaderMessage in SEMI E132-SecurityAdmin-PortType.wsdl.8.2.7.4 Since SEMI E132 does not require outgoing equipment messages to be sent over SSL, the session identifiermust be masked to avoid sending in plaintext. See 8.4 of SessionClient interface regarding handling and encodingof session identifier for outgoing equipment messages.8.2.8 From/To Header Fields8.2.8.1 Each message over SEMI E132 must also provide the originating source and intended destination using theFrom/To fields of the E132Header, as shown in Figure 10. The From element identifies the originator of themessage, and the To element identifies the intended recipient of the message, both of type xsd:string. In thisspecification, the ID of the principals that established the SEMI E132 session shall be used for purposes ofidentifying message source and destination. Although this information can be extracted based on the sessionidentifier, it is desired that the equipment and client be identified explicitly in each message.8.2.9 GetDefinedPrivileges Operation8.2.9.1 XML Schema Types8.2.9.1.1 This section describes the XML mappings for the classes defined in SEMI E132 for theGetDefinedPrivileges operation. Per WSDL convention described, a request and response message is defined forthe operation corresponding to the input and output messages.
