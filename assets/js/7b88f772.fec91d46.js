Some  equipment  users  produce  not  only\nsemiconductor  devices  but  also  Print  Circuit  Boards\n(PCBs). It is convenient for such users to have common\nmessaging   protocol   with   standard   messaging   for\nSurface  Mount  Technology  (SMT).  For  this  purpose\nthis  protocol  mapping  extension  standard  specifies  the\nmessaging    mechanism    conformant    to    IPC-2501\n\u201cDefinition for Web-Based Exchange of XML Data\u201d as\none  of  mapping  means.  Also  this  extension  standard\ndocument follows IPC-2541 \u201cGeneric Requirements for\nElectronics    Manufacturing    Shop-Floor    Equipment"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"2 ",(0,i.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.w3c.org"},"http://www.w3c.org"),",\n3 ",(0,i.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.ietf.org"},"http://www.ietf.org"),"\n,"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI T12.2-0704 \xa9 SEMI 2004 2\nCommunication  Messages\u201d  and  IPC-2551  \u201cSectional\nRequirements  for  Manufacturing  Execution  System\u201d\nfor  that  reason.  The  following  subsections  describe  a\npart  of  these  specifications  for  introduction.  Refer  to\nthese documents for detail reference.\n6. 2  SOAP   Structure   \u2014   A   HTTP   message   in   this\nspecification  has  an  envelope  to  contain  a  couple  of\nMIME blocks. One is for SOAP Envelope and the other\nis  for  message  detail  to  be  able  to  mix  with  such  non-\nXML  information  as  binary  data.  The  service  message\nspecified   in   \u201cSpecification   for   Tracking   Jigs   and\nImplements\u201d  is  contained  in  latter  one.  SOAP  standard\nenvelop  MIME  Block  contains  SOAP  Header  which\nhas   message   information   and   SOAP   Body   which\ncontains  SOAP  Faults.  Outlined  diagram  is  shown  in\nRelated  Information.  Official  definitions  are  given  in\nreferenced documents.\n6. 3  Messaging  Mechanism  \u2014  Message  Broker,  that  is\nlogical   middle   ware   server   to   handle   and   relay\nmessages,  is  assumed  somewhere  on  communication\nnetwork.  While  the  broker  behaves  as  communication\nserver,  the  other  logical  nodes  are  message  clients.\nEvery message starts with a client and responded by the\nserver.  Messages  communicated  between  clients  are\nexchanged  through  the  server.  The  server  keeps  posted\nmessages  from  clients  in  a  queue  for  each  individual\nclient.  Expecting  recipient  client  asks  the  server  for\nmessages  and  a  topmost  message  in  the  queue  for  the\nclient  is  responded  if  the  queue  is  not  empty.  The\nrecipient  client  posts  acknowledge  back  to  the  server.\nWhen  the  recipient  replies  back  a  message  to  the\noriginal   sender   client,   same   thing   happens   with\nswitched  roles  between  sender  and  recipient  clients.\nExplanatory  diagrams  for  this  outline  are  shown  in\nRelated  Information.  Official  specification  is  given  in\nreferenced documents.\n6. 4  Issues  Specific  to  this  Messaging  \u2014  A  few  issues\nfor  IPC  based  communication  protocol  for  Jigs  and\nImplements Tracking are introduced here.\n6. 4.1  Domain  Configuration  \u2014  Message  Broker  has\ndomain   configuration   information   to   make   sure   all\nacting    entities,    possible    messages    with    related\npublisher,  recipient  and  subscriber  clients.  Also  it  has\nother    detail    characteristics    of    the    domain    of\ncommunication.  Every  client  needs  to  look  up  the\ninformation before the first messaging.\n6. 4.2  Message   Information   \u2014   This   is   an   element\ncontained  in  SOAP  Header.  This  information  provides\ntime   of   transaction,   sender,   destination,   message\nidentification and schema type used for service message\ndetail in the second MIME block.\n6. 4.3  Attributes  in  Service  Message  Element  \u2014  The\ntop  element  of  each  service  message  has  date/time  of\nthe message, session ID or session reference, request ID\nor  request  reference,  and  optional  values.  Some  of  the\noptional  values  are  extended  for  Jigs  and  Implements\nTracking  communication:  linkId,  linkCnt  and  linkExp.\nThe  extension  may  be  used  for  delayed  reply  message\nand  multiple  divided  replies  to  keep  conformance  of\nrelated messages.\n7  Requirements\n7. 1  Service     Mapping     \u2014     Services     defined     in\n\u201cSpecification  for  Tracking  Jigs  and  Implement\u201d  are\nmapped on the following table.\n7. 1.1  Capitalized Service Message Element Name Base\n\u2014  Each  service  message  is  mapped  into  an  XML\nelement   with   capitalized   heading   letter   to   prevent\ncollision with XML or XML Schema native words.\n7. 1.2  Service    Message    Element    Name    Suffix   \u2014\nBecause      of      symmetry      of      message      broker\ncommunication    and    for    XML    element    naming\nconvention,  suffix  of  \u2018Request\u2019  or  \u2018Response\u2019  is  added\nto  each  service  message  element  name  for  request  or\nresponse respectively: e.g. AddEventRequest to request\nservice    and    AddEventResponse    for    its    response\nmessage."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Table 1  Service Instruction
