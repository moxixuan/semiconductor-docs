4. 1.4.4   Determine  the  time  at  which  e thane  elutes
from  the  first  column  and  absorbs  onto  the  second
column   so   one   can   vent   the   chlorine.   Inject   the
calibration  ethane  standard  and  record  the  retention
time  of  ethane  obtained  without  returning  the  valve  to
the  load  position.  Multiply  this  time  by  0.6.  The  result
will   be   the   time   during   the   analysis   at   which   the
injection  valve  should  be  returned  to  the  load  position,
backflushing the chlorine to vent.
Repeat  the  injection  of  the  ethane  calibration  standard,
including the backflush, to ensure that enough time has
passed  to  allow  elution  of  ethane  onto  the  second
column.
4. 1.4.5    Inject   the   remaining   standards    using   the
backflush  technique.  Record  the  retention  times  and
peak areas.
4. 1.4.6  Analyze the chlorine sample to  be tested in the

SPECIFICATION FOR DIBORANE MIXTURES
This specification was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility of
the European Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the European Regional Standards Committee on
April 4, 2000.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> May 2000; to be published June 2000.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  To define the specification and  analytical methods
and validate the specifications for diborane mixtures.
2  Scope</li><li>1  Diborane is not used as a pure  gas but as a mixture
with balance gases of N
2
, H
2
, Ar, He, or SiH
4
.</li><li>2  The quality of the mixture is a ffected by a number
of factors which include:
• the    purity    of    the    gases    used    for    mixture
preparation;
• component filling precision;
• the    cylinder    preparation    process    and    in-situ
reactions  of  diborane  with  the  internal  surface  of
the cylinder.</li><li>2.1   Furthermore,  the  elapsed  time   after  filling  is
important  due  to  the  chemical  instability,  and  hence
decomposition, of the diborane (see Appendix 1).</li><li>2.2    All   component   gases   shall   adh ere   to   the
appropriate SEMI specification, if available.</li><li>3   The  quality  of  the  final  mixtur e  can  be  checked
after  manufacturing  by  analyzing  each  cylinder  for  the
concentration   of   diborane   and   for   key   impurities
(tracers), namely  H

5. 3  Calibration standard — dibor ane in hydrogen
NOTE 3: Depending on the concentration of diborane and the
storage  temperature  the  standard  can  be  unstable  (Section  5).
It  is  recommended  to  use  an  appropriate  standard  with  a
diborane  concentration  as  low  as  possible  and  to  store  it  at
low temperature. If there are doubts about the stability of the
standard  the  diborane  concentration  can  be  verified  by  wet
chemical methods. (See DIN 50457-1.)
5. 4  Operating Procedures
5. 4.1   Purge  the  sampling  system  lea ding  to  the  cell
and the cell with dry nitrogen for 15 minutes and until a
zero  absorbance  is  obtained  between  2444–2739  cm
-1
.
Then  purge  the  cell  with  the  calibration  standard  and
record   the   absorption   of   diborane.   When   a   steady
absorbance  reading  is  obtained,  after  approximately  5–
10 minutes, the true concentration of the standard shall
be recorded.  Record the pressure in the gas cell using a
calibrated pressure-measuring device.
5. 4.2   To  determine  the  concentration   of  diborane  in
the   mixture   set   the   sample   flow   through   the   cell
following   the   same   procedures   as   detailed   above.
Record the absorption at the same wave number as the
calibration  standard.  Ensure  that  gas  cell  pressures  are
equal    during    calibration    and    the    determination.
Calculate the concentration of diborane. The result must
conform   to   the   specification   in   Section   4   of   this
standard.</p><p>SEMI C3.56-0600 © SEMI 20003
APPENDIX 1
STABILITY OF DIBORANE MIXTURES (FOR INFORMATION ONLY)
NOTE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI C3.56 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures on April
4, 2000 by the European Regional Standards Committee.
A1-1    The  stability  of  diborane  mixtures  in  N
2
,  Ar,  or  He  depends  on  the  concentration  of  diborane  and  on  the
storage  temperature.  At  ambient  temperature  best  stability  is  found  for  mixtures  of  diborane  in  hydrogen.  No
difference in stability could be found for different cylinder materials (steel, stainless steel, aluminum).
A1-2    The  following  values  were  measured  for  different  concentrations  of  diborane  at  two  different  storage
temperatures:
Storage TemperatureDiborane Concentration (%) in Nitrogen after
21745100160 Days

read the quantity of hydrocarbons on the analyzer. The
result  may  not  exceed  the  specification  in  Section  2  of
this Standard.
4. 6  Notes
NOTE 1: Introduce the calibration standard as many times as
necessary to achieve the desired precision.
NOTE 2: All gases used in the analysis of the sample should
contain  not  more  than  10%  of  the  specified  value  of  the
component of interest unless otherwise specified.
NOTE  3:  The  sampling  system  and  hygrometer  must  be
designed  to  operate  under  the  sample  pressure,  or  the  sample
pressure must be reduced (by a regulator with a diaphragm of
stainless  steel  or  other  suitable  material)  to  accommodate  the
pressure restrictions of the analytical hygrometer.
NOTE  4:  The  0-1  range  may  be  used  provided  that  zero  and
span   gas   standards   in   helium   with   known   levels   of
hydrocarbons  between  0-1  ppm  are  used  in  the  calibration  of
the analyzer.
NOTE 5: As the flow rate and heat capacity of the matrix gas
affect  the  instrument  output,  the  zero  gas  matrices  must
coincide with that of the sample gas.
NOTE   6:   The   effective   response   of   a   flame   ionization
detector-equipped   total   hydrocarbon   analyzer   to   different
hydrocarbons  can  vary  and  must  be  approximated.  However,
the  response  of  the  most  common  hydrocarbon  impurities  in
helium can be accurately totaled and compared to methane.

Water —  This procedure is for the determination of
trace moisture (water) in hydrogen bromide gas using a
continuous  flowing,  cooled  surface  condensation  point
hygrometer.
NOTE 1: The National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) provides calibration services for the thermometer used
in condensation point hygrometers.
NOTE 2: This  method  is  not  applicable  if  other  constituents
in the gas will condense before the moisture condensation i.e.,
excessive carbon dioxide and/or oil contamination.
NOTE 3: The   sampling   system   and   hygrometer   must   be
designed  to  operate  under  the  sample  pressure,  or  the  sample
pressure   must   be   reduced   to   accommodate   the   pressure
restrictions of the analytical hygrometer using a regulator with
a stainless steel diaphragm.
4. 2.1  Detection Limit —  2.0 ppm.
4. 2.2
Flow Requirements:
4. 2.2.1  Sample  flow  rate  and  pressure  will  be  set  in
accordance     with     the     instrument     manufacturer’s
instructions.
4. 2.2.2
Gas  must  flow  past  the  chilled  mirror  where
optic   means   are   provided   to   detect   the   deposit
(condensation)  and  to  read  the  thermometer  measuring
the temperature of the mirror.
4. 2.3
Calibration
4. 2.3.1  A  calibration  thermometer  designed  to  indicate
temperatures in the –89°C (–121°F) range is required.
4. 2.3.2
A calibration curve representing water added to
dried   hydrogen   bromide   vs   condensation   point   is
required.  This can be obtained by preparing a standard
of   water   balance   nitrogen   and   mixing   it   with   dry
hydrogen  bromide  using  a  dynamic  gas  blender  with
mass  flow  controllers  or  calibrated  flow  meters.    The
hydrogen  bromide  gas  can  be  dried  by  passing  it  over
an   activated   molecular   sieve   (5A)   or   magnesium
perchlorate.
4. 2.4
Operating Procedures
4. 2.4.1  Obtain  a  continuous  flow  of  sample  gas  from
the  source  using  a  clean  stainless  steel  sampling  line
which  has  been  purged  dry  after  exposure  to  ambient
moisture.
4. 2.4.2
After  prepurging  with  a  dry  gas,  allow  the
sample gas to flow through the sampling system and the
condensation  point  hygrometer  for  one-quarter  hour  to
two   hours   to   allow   the   entire   system   to   reach
equilibrium with regard to moisture content.
4. 2.4.3
After  equilibrium  has  been  reached,  cool  the
mirror to determine the actual condensation point of the
sample.    Follow  the  manufacturer’s  recommendations
to create the temperatures needed.
4. 2.4.4
Continue to verify the condensation point for at
least   30   minutes   after   a   stable   reading   has   been
confirmed.
4. 2.4.5
Correct the condensation point reading from the
measured pressure to 1 atm of pressure. The result may
not   exceed   the   specification   in   Section   2   of   this

SPECIFICATION FOR HYDROGEN CHLORIDE (HCl), 99.997%
QUALITY
This specification was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility of
the North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards
Committee  on  August  27,  2001.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  September  2001;  to  be  published
November 2001. Originally published in 1988; previously published in 1995.
1  Description</p><ol><li>1  Hydrogen    chloride    is    a    colorless,    pungent,
corrosive  gas  having  a  suffocating  odor.  Hydrogen
chloride is heavier than air and fumes strongly in moist
air.  It  is  very  soluble  in  water  and  alcohol,  and  also
soluble  in  ether.  While  in  the  cylinder  under  pressure,
hydrogen chloride is in the form of a gas over liquid. As
long  as  liquid  is  present  in  the  cylinder,  the  pressure
will  remain  fairly  constant.  When  the  liquid  phase  is
exhausted,   the   cylinder   pressure   will   drop   rather
rapidly.

4. 6.4  Operating Procedure
4. 6.4.1  Install switching valve and columns.
4. 6.4.2  Adjust carrier gas flows:
Switching valve in injection position
• Set a flow rate of 30 mL/min, with the regulator T1
measured at the FID outlet.
Switching valve in backflush position
• Set a flow rate of 30 mL/min, with the regulator T2
measured at the FID outlet.
• Set  a  flow  rate  of  30  mL/min,  with  the  metering
valve, measured at the pre-column outlet.
A  last  adjustment  between  the  injection  and  backflush
position may be carried out by the FID signal. For this,
the  baseline  is  recorded  in  the  injection  and  backflush
position. With the regulator T2, the flow rate is changed
so  far  as  there  is  no  offset  in  the  baseline  while
switching.
4. 6.4.3  Adjust  hydrogen  and  air  flows  and  ignite  the
burner,    following    the    instrument    manufacturer&#x27;s
instructions. Allow the system to stabilize for at least 30
minutes.
4. 6.4.4  Determine  backflush  time  —  Inject  calibration
standard and leave the switching valve in inject position
until   all   components   have   been   eluted.   Determine
retention  times  for  methane  and  acetylene.  Choose
backflush time so that the acetylene peak is completely
registered.
4. 6.4.5  Inject the calibration standard. Backflush at the
time   determined   in   Section   4.6.4.4.      Record   the
retention times and peak areas.
4. 6.4.6  Inject  the  sample  to  be  tested  in  the  same
manner  as  the  calibration  standard.  Backflush  at  the
time   determined   in   Section   4.6.4.4.      Record   the
retention times and peak areas.
4. 6.4.7  Repeat Section 4.6.4.5.
4. 6.4.8  Compare    the    average    peak    areas    of    the
calibration standard with those of the hydrogen chloride
sample being tested. Calculate the concentration of each
impurity, using the formula below. The results may not
exceed the specifications in Section 3 of this standard.

4. 7  Water — This procedure is for the determination of
trace moisture (water) in hydrogen chloride gas using a
continuous  flowing,  cooled-surface  condensation  point
hygrometer.
4. 7.1  Detection Limit — 1.0 ppm.
4. 7.2  Flow Requirements
4. 7.2.1  Set   the   sample   flow   rate   and   pressure   in

instructions.
4. 7.3  Calibration Standards
4. 7.3.1  A calibration thermometer designed to indicate
temperatures in the –89°C (–121°F) range is required.
NOTE 4: The National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST)  provides  calibration  services  for  the  thermometers
used in condensation point hygrometers.
4. 7.3.2  A calibration curve representing water added to
dried   hydrogen   chloride   vs.   condensation   point   is</p><p>SEMI C3.35-1101 © SEMI 1988, 20015
required.  This  can  be  obtained  by  preparing  a  standard
of   water   balance   nitrogen   and   mixing   it   with   dry
hydrogen  chloride  using  a  dynamic  gas  blender  with
mass  flow  controllers  or  calibrated  flowmeters.  The
hydrogen  chloride  gas  can  be  dried  by  passing  it  over
activated    molecular    sieve    (5A)    or    magnesium
perchlorate.
NOTE 5: This  method  is  not  applicable  if  other  constituents
in  the  gas  will  condense  before  the  moisture  condensation,
e.g., carbon dioxide or oil.
4. 7.4  Operating Procedure
4. 7.4.1  Obtain  a  continuous  flow  of  sample  gas  from
the  source  using  a  clean  stainless  steel  sampling  line
which  has  been  purged  dry  after  exposure  to  ambient
moisture.
NOTE 6: The   sampling   system   and   hygrometer   must   be
designed  to  operate  under  the  sample  pressure,  or  the  sample
pressure   must   be   reduced   to   accommodate   the   pressure
restrictions of the analytical hygrometer using a regulator with
a diaphragm of stainless steel or other suitable material.
4. 7.4.2  After  prepurging  with  a  dry  gas,  allow  the
sample gas to flow through the sampling system and the
condensation  point  hygrometer  for  one-quarter  hour  to
two   hours   to   allow   the   entire   system   to   reach
equilibrium with regards to moisture content.
4. 7.4.3  After  equilibrium  has  been  reached,  cool  the
mirror to determine the actual condensation point of the
sample.
4. 7.4.4  Continue to verify the condensation point for at
least   30   minutes   after   a   stable   reading   has   been
confirmed.
4. 7.4.5  Correct the condensation point reading from the
measured pressure to 1 atm of pressure. The result may
not   exceed   the   specification   in   Section   2   of   this
standard.

NOTE  1:  Pass  the  carrier  gas  through  a  trap  (3  m  (10  ft.)  by
6. 4  mm  (1/4  in.)  OD)  containing  50%  by  volume  molecular
sieve 5A and 50% by volume molecular sieve 13X submerged
in liquid nitrogen.
NOTE   2:   The   methanizer   catalyst   can   be   destroyed   by
nitrogen  trifluoride  passing  through  to  at  high  temperature.
After the carbon monoxide peak is detected, the bulk nitrogen
trifluoride   is   bypassed   to   vent   by   means   of   a   four-port
switching   valve   installed   downstream   of   the   separating
column and before the methanizer (see Figure 1).
NOTE  3:  The  sampling  system  and  hygrometer  must  be
designed  to  operate  under  the  sample  pressure,  or  the  sample
pressure must be reduced, by a regulator with a diaphragm of
stainless  steel  or  other  suitable  material,  to  accommodate  the
pressure restrictions of the analytical hygrometer.
