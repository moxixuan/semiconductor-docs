SEMI PR9-0705 © SEMI 20051 SEMI PR9-0705PROPOSED GUIDE FOR STANDARD PERFORMANCE, PRACTICES,AND ASSEMBLY FOR ULTRA HIGH PURITY MICROSCALE FLUIDICSYSTEMS FOR USE IN SCALABLE PROCESS ENVIRONMENTS This proposed guide was technically approved by the global MEMS Committee. This edition was approvedfor publication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on April 17, 2005. It was available atwww.semi.org in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005. 1 Purpose1.1 This document provides guidelines for generic fluidic I/O design and fabrication that can reduce redundantengineering effort and lead to improved design, manufacturability, testing and operation. 2 Scope2.1 This includes guidance for performance, practices, and assembly of microscale fluidic components. Thisdocument will provide guidance to users involved in design and development of standard fluidic interfaces.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This guide is a work in progress. Some sections require further development. Suggestions for improvement arewelcome. 4 Referenced Standards and Documents4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI F1  Specification for Leak Integrity of High-Purity Gas Piping Systems and ComponentsNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology(Refer to SEMIs Compilation of Terms (COT) for a list of the most current terms and their definitions.)5.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms5.1.1 MEMS Microelectromechanical systems5.1.2 TLA  Three Letter Acronym5.2 Definitions5.2.1 Microscale  106 meters.5.2.2 Microfluidics  fluid transport, physics, and chemistry on microscale dimensions.5.2.3 Micro Sealing Dimensions  flow channel cross sections having an effective diameter of &lt;25 micrometers;optionally flow channel cross sections having an effective diameter of 25 to 100 micrometers.5.2.4 Macro Sealing Dimensions  flow channel cross sections having an effective diameter of &gt;100 micrometers.5.2.5 Microfluidic Components  fluidic components functioning at the scale of 1-100 micrometers. Examples:micro flow channels, microvalves, micro pumps.5.2.6 Microsealing Systems5.2.7 Macro to Micro Sealing  sealing that connects the micro regime with the macro regime.5.2.8 Microsealing  sealing on components at the microscale.

SEMI PR9-0705 © SEMI 2005 2 5.2.9 Wafer Level Sealing  bonding of wafers by anodic, silicon direct, eutectic, or adhesive means.5.2.10 Macrosealing  sealing on components at the macroscale.5.2.11 Static Seals  seals that operate with non-moving surfaces.5.2.12 Dynamic Seals  seals that operate with moving surfaces.5.2.13 high-purity  of a system, subsystem, or component used for the control of chemicals (gases or liquids),designed and constructed in such a manner that it does not introduce significant impurities, particulate or molecular,into the flow stream it controls or regulates.NOTE 1: Such systems, subsystems, or components are designed and constructed such that, if an impurity is introduced into theflow path, it can be readily purged to an insignificant level.5.3 leak  a path (or paths) in a sealed system that will pass tracer gas when a pressure differential, a concentrationdifferential, or diffusion path exists. There are two leak mechanisms: a mechanical passage and a material throughwhich gas can diffuse or permeate. A leak may have both mechanisms operating in parallel.5.4 leakage, inboard  leakage from outside to inside occurring when the internal pressure is less than the externalpressure acting on a component or the concentrations of a given component are different inside and outsidegenerating a non-zero chemical potential. Inboard leakage is typically determined by introducing a tracer gas aroundthe exterior of the piping system or component under test.NOTE 2: Inboard leak tests are easier tests to conduct to high sensitivity levels, but are typically not indicative of pressurizedoperating conditions. It is difficult to correlate an inboard leak test to the performance of a component, subsystem, or systemwhen under internal pressure. Also, the internal collapsing forces created by external pressure may mask leaks which may existunder pressurized operating conditions.5.5 leakage, internal  leakage occurring within a component across a flow barrier, such as the seat of a closedvalve.5.6 leakage, outboard  leakage from inside to outside occurring when the internal pressure is greater than theexternal pressure acting on a component. Outboard leakage is typically determined by introducing a tracer gas intothe interior of the piping system or component under test.5.7 Microfluidic Subsystesm  a microfluidic subsystem in a fluidic system may contain one or many MEMScomponents. The subsystem contains control and signaling elements. The subsystem, in turn, is attached fluidicallyto a larger system or subsequent process. e.g. mass flow controller for fluid delivery, lab-on-a-chip.5.7.1 Fluidic Adapter  a physical interconnecter that fluidically links a microfluidic component to another micro-or macro-scale fluidic device. 6 Design Guidelines6.1 Purpose  Define basic design criteria for micro-fluidic interconnections, considering factors such as fluidtype, pressure, flow rate, surface conditions, materials and their compatibilities, etc. Establish a recommendedstandard scaling rule for dimensions of such interconnections.6.2 Scope  Micro-sealing connections as defined in 5.2.3 above, for applications in two pressure ranges: belowone atmosphere and 0125 psig, and in three temperature ranges: &lt;0 C, 0100 C, and &gt;100 C.6.3 Define Design Parameters6.3.1 Overall dimension and weight constraints: MEMS component, subsystems, system, fittings, manifolds.6.3.2 For different materials used to join parts check that the differences in thermal expansion coefficients areacceptable for the temperature range that the component or system will be used in.6.3.3 For different materials used to join parts check material chemical characteristics are compatible (see materials7 below).6.3.4 Fluid types to be used with MEMS, define gases and liquids, reference SEMI F79 (Gas Compatibility withSilicon). List all materials in wetted path.6.3.5 Electrical configuration, digital or analog IEEE standards?

For example gas and liquidcannot use the same scaling rule.6.3.20 Adapter guidelines for smooth transition from Macro to Micro. This is for the case the MEMS system is toreplace an existing device, and there is a mismatch of the dimensions. A flexible transition may be considered ifspace is limited.6.3.21 Surfaces that come into contact with samples, process gasses, or chemicals must not adsorb or react withthem. Select components or tubing that is: 1) inherently compatible, 2) can be treated (water rinsed, O2 ashing, acidclean...) or 3) coated (Teflon®, SiO 2, ...), to be compatible. Consider protein materials where the quantity ofbiomaterial sticking to surfaces will be dependent upon the wetted surface area and how well the fluid adsorbs to thesurface. 7 Materials Guidelines7.1 Purpose  Provide a Matrix of Materials Compatibility for commonly used materials and provide examples ofapplying the matrix to designs.7.2 Scope  Use of this guide is limited to materials types known to be commonly used such as: silicon, polymers,glass, metals, ceramics and plastics.7.2.1 This guideline applies to materials which may be used in fluidic devices in large or small form factors. It isassumed the material is in the wetted flow path as either a thin surface film or bulk material. Standard temperature(0C) and pressure (1 atm) are conditions considered in this table unless otherwise stated. Physical, mechanical,thermal, microstructural, and electrical properties of materials can be found in materials selection handbooks ormaterial supplier datasheets. Breadth of details for chemical compatibility and materials properties varies widelywithin these literature and care must be taken to consider relevant information. unlikely that a single source ofinformation would be suitable.7.2.2 The intended use of the compatibility matrix is to provide a general resource to the user. Detailed researchinto materials compatibility with specific chemicals is an important part of any product development program. Indepth research into materials and fluid analysis are beyond the scope of this guide and will be required in mostcircumstances. 1 Hsu, Tai-Ran; MEMS and Microsystems Design and Manufacture; McGraw-Hill, 2002 Section 6.7.

Visual inspection, pressure drop test (time to lose pressure).8.6.5 Helium leak test (any existing standards we can refer to?)8.6.6 Temperature cycles. Cycle parts in the expected application environments that the components will beexposed to or in an acceleration chamber with controlled temperature.8.6.7 In case of disposable devices, only a small sample size from a product lot can be tested. Detailed test planscan be found in subsystem guidelines.8.7 An example with a diagram is desired. See Figures 14. 9 Subsystem Guidelines9.1 Purpose  Provide guidance for assembly and testing of Microfluidic subsystems, considering applicableperformance and operating specifications. Examples of performance characteristics are response time, accuracy,reliability, drydown, and cleanliness.9.2 Scope  These guidelines are limited to macro sealing and macro to micro sealing. It specifically excludeswafer-scale testing. They address interconnection (fluidic, electrical, and other) of the microfluidic subsystem to theexternal system. They also address interconnection of individual components within the microfluidic subsystem.9.3 Assembly and Test Preparation9.3.1 Visually inspect parts under microscope before assembly. Perform any testing possible at the MEMScomponent level as characterization or to determine failures before integrating.9.3.2 Assemble under hoods or in cleanroom. Wear gloves. Use electrostatic protection. Assembly should be inthe same class environment as required by user. See SEMI E129.9.3.3 Follow manufacturers instructions for tightening fittings and seals and connecting parts. If applicable,measure torque or other assembly parameters. Subsystem should have means or method to hold part being tightenedto not compromise the structural integrity of the part.9.3.4 Seals used to connect components should be considered for thermal performance, cleanliness, and materialcompatibility. See 9.4.?.9.3.5 Test systems should have filters installed upstream of the device under test. Select pore size similar to poresize used in final application.9.4 Verification and Validation9.4.1 The following are guidelines for verification and validation. Some may also apply to production testing.9.4.2 Test for particles and for other contamination characteristics such as moisture dry down as required by enduser as a system. See ASTM F1394 (particle), SEMI E66 (particle), ASTM F1397 (moisture).9.4.3 Test for applicable performance parameters such as accuracy using NIST traceable standards. Time orprocess response characterizations should model system and connection volumes, based on specification designedfor. If the final application can not be duplicated, consider final system in the data analysis. For faster process timeminimize volume and surface area between the flow control system and chamber. Test in gas or liquid that it will beused with or list substitute/test gas or liquid on test report.9.4.4 Cycle parts in environment that they will be used in or in an accelerated mode. This is to model mean time tofailure or other parameters of reliability. At intervals test for most important performance or operating parameters.See ASTM F1394, ASTM F1373.9.4.5 Leak test mechanical connections using inboard leak detection method. For positive shut-off components testfor leak across the seat.

SEMI P7-0997 © SEMI 1982, 20031 SEMI P7-0997 (Reapproved 1103)METHOD OF VISCOSITY DETERMINATION, METHOD A  KINEMATICVISCOSITY This method was technically reapproved by the Global Micropatterning Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Microlithography Committee. Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on July 27, 2003. Initially available on www.semi.org October2003; to be published November 2003. Originally published in 1982; previously published in September1997. 1 Scope1.1 This method, a simplified version of ASTM D 445and ASTM F 66 is intended for determining thekinematic viscosity of photoresists by measuring thetime for a volume of liquid to flow under gravitythrough a calibrated glass capillary at a fixedtemperature. Efflux time is measured in seconds andmultiplied by the calibration constant of the viscometerto obtain kinematic viscosity in units of centistokes(cSt). Optionally, kinematic viscosity may be multipliedby the density of the photoresist to obtain dynamicviscosity in units of centipoise (cP). Refer toASTM D 445 and F 66 for additional information anddefinitions.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 2 Referenced Standards2.1 ASTM Standard1 D 445  Kinematic Viscosity of Transparent andOpaque Liquids (and the Calculation of DynamicViscosity)F 66  Photoresist Used in MicroelectronicFabricationsNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 3 Apparatus3.1 Calibrated Viscometer  Of the glass capillarytype.

Choose the proper tube size for thegiven viscosity so that the efflux time is greater than orequal to 200 seconds.4.3 Charge the viscometer with photoresist in themanner dictated by the design of the viscometer andwipe clean.4.4 Insert the viscometer into the clamp holder in theconstant temperature bath. Vertical alignment of theviscometer is essential for proper flow measurement.4.5 Allow 15 minutes for the sample temperature toequilibrate.4.6 Use suction or pressure to adjust the level of thetest sample to a position in the capillary arm about 5mm ahead of the first timing mark.4.7 With the sample flowing freely, measure the timefor the meniscus to pass from the first timing mark tothe second. Record the time in seconds.4.8 Repeat the steps in Sections 4.6 and 4.7. (Forreverse flow viscometers, use the same or anotherviscometer and begin with the step in Section 4.3 forthe second measurement.)4.9 The two measurements must agree within 0.5seconds. If they do not agree, then reject themeasurement results.4.10 After the measurement, the viscometer should beflushed several times with a suitable solvent (methyl
