It is not the intent\nof  this  document  to  be  the  only  means  of  demonstrating  the  electrical  safety  conformance  of  semiconductor\nmanufacturing equipment.\n6. 2  Equipment that satisfies other national or international electrical product safety standards meets the intent of this\ndocument.\n7  Design Philosophy\nNOTE 13:  This  section  is  intended  to  provide  general  design  guidance  to  engineers;  for  specific  design  considerations  see  \xa78\nthrough \xa722.\n7. 1  This   document   should   be   used   during   the   electrical   design,   construction,   and   evaluation   phases   of\nsemiconductor manufacturing equipment.  The intent of this safety guideline is to provide a design based electrical\ndocument  that  will  be  useful  to  both  design  engineers  and  evaluators,  in  order  to  facilitate  electrical  safety  in  the\nequipment.\n7. 2  Designers  that  understand  these  general  principles  of  safety  are  more  likely  to  design  safe  equipment.  This\nsection is not an alternative to the more specific engineering considerations of this safety guideline, but is intended\nto provide designers with an appreciation of the basic safety principles.\n7. 3  Electric shock is due to current passing through the human body.  Currents on the order of a milliampere may\ncause  a  reaction  in  people  in  good  health,  and  may  cause  indirect  mishap  due  to  involuntary  reactions.  Higher\ncurrents may have higher severity risks.\n7. 4  Design  of  equipment  should  provided  protection  of  personnel  from  electric  shock  or  arc  flash/blast  that  may\nresult from reasonably forseeable single faults.\n7. 5  Service and maintenance personnel should be protected against inadvertent contact with electrical hazards.\n7. 6  Movable  cord-connected  equipment  is  considered  to  present  a  slightly  increased  risk  of  shock  as  well  as\noverheating,  due  to  strain  on  the  supply  cord  leading  to  damage  to  the  connections,  insulation,  and  the  protective\nearthing  conductor.  With  portable  cord-connected  equipment,  wear  on  the  cord  is  more  likely,  and  further  hazards\ncould arise if the equipment were dropped.\n7. 7  Short-circuiting between phases and phase to ground of high current supplies or high capacitance circuits may\ncause arcing or ejection of molten metal which may cause burns. Even low voltage circuits may be dangerous in this\nrespect. Protection should be provided by adequate separation, by shielding, or by using safety interlocks.\n7. 8  When temperatures that could cause a hazard result from overloads, component failure, insulation breakdown,\nhigh resistance or loose connections, the risk of fire may be reduced by one or more of the following means:"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S22-1103a \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2005 9\na) taking all reasonable steps to avoid high temperatures which might cause ignition;\nb) controlling the position of combustible materials in relation to possible ignition sources;\nc) limiting the quantity of combustible materials used;\nd) using barriers, if necessary, to limit the spread of fire within the equipment beyond the immediate vicinity of the\nignition source; and/or\ne) using suitable materials for the outer fire enclosures of the equipment.\nNOTE 14:  SEMI S14 may also be used for guidance on fire risk mitigation.\nNOTE 15:  Some fire retardant components or materials may be restricted or banned in certain jurisdictions.\n7. 9  Equipment should be designed to prevent injury due to excessive (high or low) temperatures of parts; to ensure\nthat the equipment is mechanically stable and structurally sound; to avoid the presence of operator accessible sharp\nedges and points; and to provide adequate guarding or safety interlocking of hazardous moving parts.\n7. 10  Materials used in the construction of equipment should be selected and arranged so that they may be expected\nto  perform  in  a  reliable  manner,  without  a  risk  of  energy  hazard  or  electric  shock  developing,  and  such  that  they\nwould not contribute significantly to the development of a significant fire hazard.\nNOTE 16:  Some  electrical  components  such  as  relays,  electrolytic  capacitors,  batteries,  solder,  cathode  ray  tubes,  finished\nchassis, fluorescent lights and connectors may contain materials that are restricted or banned in certain jurisdictions.\n8  General Considerations\n8. 1  The  risks  associated  with  the  electrical  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the  equipment  should  be\nconsidered as part of the overall safety assessment of the equipment.  This assessment should include a fault analysis\nwith  consideration  given  to,  but  not  limited  to,  electric  shock  or  fire  and  failures  of  components,  subsystems,  and\nsystems.\n8. 2  The following are some of the types of faults that should be considered:\na) faults and failures in the equipment\u2019s circuits, and\nb) possible human error associated with operator, maintenance, and service activities.\nNOTE 17:  This is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all possible types of faults.\n8. 3  The order of precedence for resolving identified hazards and satisfying equipment safety considerations should\nbe as follows:\na) design to eliminate hazards,\nb) incorporate safety devices,\nc) provide hazard alerts or warning signals, and finally\nd) develop  administrative  procedures  and  training  (administrative  procedures  may  include  the  use  of  personal\nprotective equipment).\nA combination of these approaches can also be used.\nNOTE 18:  See SEMI S2 for additional information.\n8. 4  Electrical Components\n8. 4.1  Where failure of components and assemblies could result in an unacceptable increase in risk of electric shock,\nfire,  or  personnel  injury,  those  components  and  assemblies  should  be  certified  by  an  accredited  testing  laboratory\nand  used  in  accordance  with  the  manufacturer\u2019s  specifications  and  conditions  of  the  certification,  or  otherwise\nevaluated  to  the  relevant  component  standard(s).
