6  Summary of Practice
6. 1    The  welding  procedure  is  shown  in  the  flow  chart
in Figure 1.
7  General Requirements
7. 1    All  welding  performed  under  this  practice  shall
conform  to  the  applicable  requirements  of  the  ASME
Boiler  and  Pressure  Vessel  Code,  Section  IX,  ANSI
B16.25, B31.3 Chapter V, and AWS B2.1, to the extent
that they are included herein.
7. 2    All  welds  shall  be  based  upon  Welding  Procedure
Specifications    (WPS)    and    be    documented    with
associated  Procedure  Qualification  Records  (PQR)  in
accordance  with  ASME  Boiler  and  Pressure  Vessel
Code, Section IX, or with AWS B2.1.
7. 3  Qualification of the welding procedures to be used,
and   of   the   performance   of   welders   and   welding
operators,  shall  conform  to  the  requirements  of  the
ASME  Boiler  and  Pressure  Vessel  Code,  Section  IX,
Articles II and III, or AWS B2.1.
7. 4    All  welding  shall  be  performed  only  by  certified
welders and welding operators. Certification procedures
shall    include,    at    the    minimum,    producing    three
acceptable welds in a row of typical GTA weld joints of
the  smallest  and  largest  diameters  of  each  alloy  to  be
welded.  Welding  parameters  shall  be  set  by  the  welder
or  welding  operator.  Certification  shall  expire  after  six
months of inactivity.
7. 5        The    weld    assembly    shall    be    kept    under    a
continuous purge until all welding is complete.
7. 6    Welders  shall  use  clean  room-compatible  gloves
any  time  that  the  tubing  or  component  to  be  welded  is
removed from protective covering.
8  Apparatus
8. 1      Welding   equipment   shall   be   of   the   GTAW,
constant   current,   DCEN   (direct   current   electrode
negative)  and  electronically  controlled  type  with  rapid
dynamic  response  capable  of  5  Hz  (CPS)  or  greater
pulsed welding.
8. 2  All welding fixtures and weld heads shall be clean
and free of any particulate and  excessive  discoloration.
Weld  heads  shall  rotate  freely  and  smoothly  at  all
speeds.  All  clamping  and  holding  fixtures  shall  fit
tightly  around  applicable  fittings/tubing,  allowing  no
movement   after   clamping   in   excess   of   0.003   inch
(0.008  cm).  The  welding  fixturing  shall  allow  viewing
of the weld joint to insure proper fit-up.
8. 3    Electrodes  shall  be  precision  ground  to  the  factory
specification  for  head  and  weld  type.  Electrode  gap
shall  be  set  using  tooling  or  procedures  that  provide
accurate  and  repeatable  gaps  to  be  set  to  within  0.002
in.  (0.005  cm).  The  use  of  2%  Ce-doped  or  2%  La-
doped tungsten electrodes is recommended.
8. 4    Purge  gas  apparatus  shall  be  stainless  steel  tubing
and  components  with  face  seal  fittings,  when  possible.
PFA  plastic  tubing  is  acceptable  as  the  final  run  to
allow flexibility for hook-up. Lengths shall be restricted
to  less  than  ten  feet.  All  components  that  come  into
contact with the weldment shall be stainless steel. Only
heavy wall PFA or stainless tubing shall be used on the
ID  purge.  Only  stainless  tubing  shall  be  used  on  HP
systems.
8. 5  Purge gas flow shall be measured and controlled.
8. 6      Facing   equipment   shall   be   of   the   dry   end
machining  style.  The  equipment  shall  be  capable  of
tolerances  of  0.003  inches  from  a  plane  perpendicular
to the centerline of the tube, the OD and /or ID burr of
less than 0.005 inches. The equipment shall be capable
of controlling the cut curl so as that it does not enter the
tubing  or  cause  scratching  of  the  ID  surface.  The
equipment shall not use oils or lubricants in a way that


SEMI F78-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 5
may contaminate the tubing being faced. The cutting or
facing shall not be of a abrasive type.
8. 7      Severing   or   parting   equipment   shall   be   of   the
machining  type  that  will  separate  the  tubing  without
contaminating  the  ID  of  the  tubing.  Wheel  type  cutters
designed  to  cut  stainless  steel  and  CRAs  are  allowed
with  purge.  Dry  saws  of  orbital  type  or  cutoff  are
allowed  only  when  followed  by  cleaning  to  12.5.  All
cut ends shall meet the tolerances for facing equipment
or be followed by end preparation with a facing tool.
9  Materials
9. 1  All materials to be welded shall be manufactured to
ASTM    specifications    and    so    certified    by    the
manufacturer.  Certification  shall  conform  to  ASTM
A450, Section 25.
9. 2    All  seamless  austenitic  stainless  steel  tubing  shall
be   in   conformance   with   SEMI   F20   or   customer
specification.
9. 3  A backing (ID) gas is required during welding, and
while tacking (if tacking is used).
9. 4    Weld  parameters  are  affected  by  the  choice  of
shield  gas.  Argon,  due  to  its  effectiveness  and  material
compatibility, is the most commonly selected shielding
and   purging   gas.   Argon   and   helium   are   inert   and
therefore have no effect on the weld metal. These gases
do  have  very  different  ionization  potentials,  thermal
conductivity, and reactivity.
9. 5    Argon/hydrogen  mix  is  a  reducing  gas  that  avoids
the  formation  of  oxides.  It  also  reduces  the  amperage
required for a given ID weld bead width while reducing
the  OD  bead  width.  Argon/hydrogen  mixes  adversely
affect high ferrite materials (above 80% ferrite). Use of
argon/hydrogen  mixes  will  shorten  tungsten  electrode
life. The weld parameters will be affected by hydrogen
to  argon  percentages.  Hydrogen  mixes  above  5  vol%
are not recommended for safety reasons.
9. 6    Nitrogen  will  cause  instability  of  the  arc  in  mixes
above  3  vol%  in  the  shield  (OD)  purge  gas.  It  is  a
acceptable backing (ID) gas for austenitic stainless and
many   CRAs.   Nitrogen   when   exposed   to   welding
temperatures  will  cause  nitride  formation  in  some  high
ferrite  materials  (above  80%  ferrite).  Use  of  nitrogen
mixes   in   the   shielding   (OD)   gas   will   shorten   the
tungsten electrode life.
9. 7  The ID purge gas will be certified to 99.9997%, or
less  than  3  ppm  total  contaminants  (moisture,  oxygen,
and other contaminants).
10  Safety Precautions
10. 1  This practice does not purport to address all of the
safety   issues   associated   with   its   use.   It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
10. 2    Welding  equipment  used  to  make  welds  shall  be
operated    in    accordance    with    the    manufacturerís
operating and safety instructions.
10. 3      All  welding  performed  under  this  practice  shall
conform  to  the  applicable  requirements  of  ANSI/ASC
Z49.1.
10. 4         Welding   gas   mixtures   containing   more   than
5 vol% H
2
are not recommended due to the potential for
fire hazard.
10. 5    Do  not  reweld  stainless  steel  that  has  been  used
for corrosive gas delivery.
10. 6  See Appendix 1 for information on stainless steel
and welding fume.
11  Test Specimens: Couponing
11. 1    Prior  to  the  welding  of  a  particular  size,  wall
thickness,  and  alloy,  a  primary  standard  sample  weld
shall  be  made,  sectioned,  and  analyzed  at  the  job  site.
The primary standard sample weld shall become the on-
site work sample against which other welds of the same
size,  wall  thickness,  and  alloy  are  judged.  This  on-site
work  sample  may  be  used  indefinitely  or  reproduced
each day at the discretion of the examiner.
11. 2      The   primary   standard   sample   weld   shall   be
checked for compliance with SEMI F81, ìSpecification
for  Visual  Inspection  and  Acceptance  of  Gas  Tungsten
Arc  (GTA)  Welds  in  Fluid  Distribution  Systems  in
Semiconductor  Manufacturing  Applications.î  Coupons
shall  be  cross-sectioned  and  inspected  visually.  Weld
coupon  criteria  are  the  same  criteria  for  all  system
welds.
11. 3   Once a sample weld is found to be acceptable, all
essential and supplementary essential variables shall be
documented in the procedure qualification record.
11. 4         Any   significant   deviation(s)   from   the   on-site
work  sample  will  cause  the  weld(s)  to  be  rejected.
Rejected welds shall be removed and replaced.
11. 5      Sample  test  welds  shall  be  made  periodically.
These  sample  test  welds  shall  be  compared  to  the  on-
site  work  sample  and  checked  for  compliance  with
SEMI  F81.  Deviation  from  the  on-site  work  sample  or
SEMI  F81  shall  be  cause  for  rejection.  If  the  weld
inside diameter is inspectable using a sight tube or other
device,  sample  test  welds  may  be  production  welds.


SEMI F78-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 6
Sample  test  welds  shall  be  made  when  any  of  the
following conditions exist:
11. 5.1  Start of shift (in) or end of shift (out).
11. 5.2  Change of weld parameters.
11. 5.3  Change of material (heat number).
11. 5.4  Change of tube size or wall thickness.
11. 5.5        Change    of    ambient    temperature    ±    20∞F
(± 11∞C).
11. 5.6    Change  of  source  of  power  to  power  supply  to
include addition or subtraction of extension cords.
11. 5.7  Change or removal of the weld electrode.
11. 5.8    Any  change  of  equipment  such  as  weld  head,
weld head extensions, or power supply.
11. 5.9    Any  time  that  a  weld  discrepancy  is  noted  by
the welding operator.
11. 5.10  Any significant change of ID or OD purge gas
(source or flow rate).
11. 6    All  couponing  shall  use  the  same  ID  purge  gas
and OD shielding gas as the production weld (Figure 2).
12  Procedure
12. 1    Documented  procedures  shall  exist  for  each  weld
configuration including all parameters (including purge
times, orifice sizes, purge rates, and internal pressure).
12. 2  Check  parameters  and verify  that  they  are  in
accordance with the qualified welding procedure.
12. 3  Perform only one weld joint at a time.
12. 4  Joint Preparation Procedure
12. 4.1    All  cutting  of  component  or  tubing  weld  ends
shall be done with a sharp-edged tool. No lubricants of
any kind shall be allowed.
12. 4.2    All  component  and  tubing  weld  ends  shall  be
de-burred after cutting.
12. 4.3  Surfaces for welding shall be clean and shall be
free  from  oxidation,  discoloration,  oil,  scale,  chips,  or
other material that is detrimental to welding.
12. 4.4  Unless tubing is to be cleaned afterward, tubing
shall  be  opened,  cut,  faced,  and  deburred  in  a  required
cleanroom  environment,  leaving  no  visible  particulates
inside the cut end.
12. 4.5        The    tube    shall    be    faced    to    remove    all
necking/wedging caused by the tube cutters (Figure 3).
For  tube  cutting,  use  a  wheel  cutter  with  lathe-type
facing  tool  or  a  special  designed  power  saw  with
alignment  guide.  Do  not  use  lubricant.  If  any  ìnicksî
are found, reface or discard the tube.
12. 4.6    Unless  tubing  is  to  be  cleaned  afterward,  all
weld end preparation shall be done in such a manner as
to  minimize  the  introduction  of  contaminants  into  the
system.  When  bending,  cutting,  or  facing  tubing  a
positive purge must be used to remove any particles.
12. 4.7  The  prepared  end  shall  conform  to  ASTM  A
632 (or ASTM A 269 ≥ Ω in. OD) tubing specification
with regard to ovality and wall thickness.
12. 4.8    The  weld  fit-up  gap  shall  not  exceed  0.003  in.
(0.08  mm)  when  the  entire  circumference  is  affected
(Figure 4). The maximum gap in any one area shall not
exceed  0.006  in.  (0.15  mm)  (Figure  5).  The  prepared
end shall be square to tube run within º° (angle).
12. 4.9      After   preparing,   debur   the   inside   diameter
carefully   and   lightly.   Do   not   scratch   the   inside
diameter.  Any  scratched  tubes  shall  be  reprepped  or
scrapped.
12. 4.10  Chamfering  is  undesirable.  The  maximum  OD
or  ID  chamfering  shall  be  less  than  10%  of  the  wall
thickness  or  0.005  in.  (0.13  mm)  whichever  is  less
(Figure 6).
12. 4.11  All components shall be maintained in a clean
condition until welded into the system.
12. 4.12    All  benders,  cutters,  facing  tool  collets,  or
brushes  that  are  to  be  used  on  stainless  tubing  or  alloy
tubing shall not be used on carbon steel tubing and care
shall  be  used  on  mixing  alloys.  All  tools  shall  be
maintained  in  clean  condition  and  shall  be  free  of
grease,  oil,  dirt,  and  other  foreign  matter.  Avoid  cross-
contamination from dissimilar materials.
12. 4.13    Bends  on  the  tubing  shall  not  be  made  in  the
weld area.
12. 4.14    Use  only  tools  and  handling  techniques  that
will not mar, disturb the shape of, or in any way reduce
the conformance to specifications of the materials used
in this system.
12. 4.15    Tube  ends  shall  be  covered  while  the  purge  is
removed   using   a   technique   that   will   minimize   the
amount of infiltration or contamination. Covers shall be
of non-particulating material.
12. 4.16    Remove  protective  cover  immediately  prior  to
performing the weld.
12. 5  Tube Cleaning
12. 5.1  It is recommended that all cut tubing be cleaned.
At a minimum, tubing contaminated during preparation
shall be cleaned using a high purity cleaning procedure.


SEMI F78-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 7
12. 5.2    In  the  case  of  contaminated  tubing,  or  if  a  cut-
out  or  saw  cut  is  necessary,  the  following  cleaning
procedure shall be used:
12. 5.2.1  Primary rinse in cold running DI water.
12. 5.2.2    Secondary  rinse  in  hot  [80∞C  (176∞F)]  DI
water.
12. 5.2.3  Final rinse in DI water with pressure flush.
12. 5.2.4        Blow    dry    with    pressurized    hot    [150∞C
(318∞F)]  N
2
.  Ensure  that  drying  occurs  immediately
after final rinse.
12. 5.2.5    Use  immediately  or  cap  and  seal  in  plastic
sleeves.
12. 6  Purging
12. 6.1    All  welds  must  use  a  positive  and  repeatable
form  of  ID  purge  pressure  control.  See  Table  1  for
suggested settings and refer to Figures 7 and 8.
12. 6.2    Production  welds  must  use  the  same  flow  rates
and ID purge pressures as the qualified coupon weld.
12. 6.3    During  welding,  all  tubes,  fittings,  valves,  sub-
assemblies,    and    all    other    components    shall    be
continuously purged.
12. 6.4      Automatic   orbital   welding   equipment   shall
supply  a  constant  gas  shield  to  the  weld  head  during
welding.
12. 6.5      During   all   welding,   a   sufficient   amount   of
purge/shield  gas  shall  be  maintained  until  the  weld  has
cooled  to  a  temperature  where  it  can  be  handled,  and
until  the  weld  head  is  removed  from  the  newly  welded
parts.
12. 6.6  Both purge/shield gas supply lines shall contain
flow indicators to ensure proper purging.
12. 6.7  For welding of installed systems that will not be
subsequently  cleaned,  once  construction  begins,  an  ID
purge  shall  be  maintained,  either  a  flowing  purge  of  3
to 5 scfh (1 to 2 L/min.) or a block purge of 30 psi (206
kPa),  until  the  system  is  complete.  A  flowing  purge  is
recommended on UHP systems.
12. 6.8      The   purge   supply   shall   have   a   means   to
manifold it so that there is a single point of connection
for each line under construction.
12. 6.9    Extreme  care  shall  be  taken  to  ensure  that  all
contiguous flowpaths are fully purged.
12. 6.10    All  dead  legs  must  be  purged  out  completely
prior to welding.
12. 6.11    All  welds  shall  be  performed  with  the  purge
flow  established  by  the  weld  procedure  specification
sweeping the weld area during and after welding.
12. 6.12  Vacuum devices may be required to overcome
back pressure in components such as regulators, filters,
purifiers,     check     valves,     or     others.     Dead-end
components  such  as  gauges  may  be  purged  using  a
small-diameter  tube  placed  inside  the  tubing  to  be
welded and back-flowing purge through the weld zone.
12. 6.13  Pre-purging and post-purging shall occur for as
long    as    necessary    to    avoid    unacceptable    weld
discoloration.
12. 6.14  Light external oxidation may be removed with
a  stainless  steel  wire  brush  immediately  after  welding.
Purge  shall  be  maintained  during  the  brushing  process,
and care shall be taken to perform the brushing process
in an appropriate area so as not to contaminate the work
area.
12. 7  Welding Electrode
12. 7.1        Welding    electrodes    shall    be    changed    as
frequently  as  necessary  to  prevent  weld  deterioration.
Typical number of welds per electrode is as follows:

Tube diameter Welds per electrode
º-in. and under 25 to 50
3/8 to 1.0-in.  20 to 25
1. 0 to 2.0-in. 10 to 20
2. 0-in. and above 10 to 15

12. 7.2  Electrode shall be cut, not  broken to length.
12. 8  Additional Requirements
12. 8.1  Maintain sufficient distance between weld joints
and valve seats to avoid damage to valve seats or valve
stem   tips   when   purging   through   the   valve.   Purge
through the valve to the weld when possible.
12. 8.2    Valves  shall  be  located  so  as  to  allow  space  to
operate the valve after installation at the job site.
12. 8.3    Valves  must  be  cool  to  the  touch  after  welding
and prior to cycling to avoid damage to the seat.
12. 8.4  Clean Room Welding
12. 8.4.1    Welders  shall  follow  all  clean  room  protocol
and  use  non-powdered  latex  gloves  any  time  that  the
tubing  or  component  to  be  welded  is  removed  from
protective covering.
12. 8.4.2    All  tools  and  fixtures  used  for  the  assembly
and  welding  shall  be  maintained  clean  and  shall  not  be
removed  for  use  outside  of  the  clean  room  preparation
area.
12. 8.4.3      As   much   welding   as   is   feasible   will   be
performed  in  the  clean  room  preparation  area  in  the
form of sub-assemblies.


SEMI F78-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 8
12. 8.5  Field Installation
12. 8.5.1  If a system cut-out or cut-in is required, purge
shall  be  applied  to  both  ends  or  the  down  stream  end
must  be  discarded  or  cleaned,  per  Section  12.5.  The
following cutout procedure shall be followed:
12. 8.5.1.1    Set  purge  pressures  to  5  psi    max  (35  kPa)
for safety.
12. 8.5.1.2      Make   initial   cut.   WARNING
:   When   the
tube  is  cut  purge  gas  will  escape  the  cut  area  at  high
velocity. This gas may contain particles from the cut or
the   tubing.   Protect   yourself,   others,   and   nearby
equipment from injury or damage (Figure 8).
12. 8.5.1.3  Make any additional cuts.
12. 8.5.1.4  Face the ends.
12. 8.5.1.5  Set single purge direction for welding.
12. 8.5.1.6  All cuts shall be done in the horizontal when
possible.
13  Interpretation of Results: Weld Inspection
13. 1  All welds shall be 100% inspected on the outside
surface  and  whenever  possible  on  the  ID  surface  to
insure  conformance  to  the  weld  bead  specifications
listed in SEMI F81.
13. 2  Dimensional   and   Configuration   Inspection   ó
Dimensional   and   configuration   inspection   shall   be
performed as follows:
13. 2.1    One  hundred  percent  subassemblies  shall  be
inspected.  If  a  subassembly  is  opened  for  inspection,
the  inspection  must  be  performed  in  a  clean  room  of
same class as the assembly area.
13. 2.2    Confirm  fabrication  drawing  is  attached  to  the
assembly; if not, reject.
13. 2.3      Use   check   sheet   to   verify   conformance   of
assembly  to  drawing.  Check  dimensions,  squareness,
offsets,   straight   edges,   and   levels   to   verify   all
dimensions.
13. 2.4    Inspect  each  weld  externally  in  reference  to  the
coupon.
13. 2.5    When  subassemblies  have  passed  inspection,
they shall be tagged as such, rebagged, and released for
final testing.
13. 3    Any  items  found  defective  during  inspection  and
repairable   may   be   repaired,   if   the   repair   will   not
degrade    the    system    conformance    to    installation
specifications.
13. 4    Where  a  weld  is  found  defective,  the  preceding
two  welds  shall  be  tested  as  indicated  in  Section  11.  If
either  of  these  welds  is  rejectable  per  SEMI  F81,  then
all  welds  made  since  the  last  welding  procedure  was
established shall be removed and replaced.
14  Report
14. 1    Coupons  shall  be  logged  with  the  date  and  time
and  operator  identification.  Coupons  and  coupon  logs
shall  be  retained  for  one  year.  Sample  test  welds  shall
be kept on file and may be reviewed at any time during
the construction.
14. 2    A  daily  log  shall  be  maintained  on  all  system
welds  and  coupons  (see  Weld  and  Coupon  Log,  Table
2),  and  as-built  drawings  recording  all  data  shall  be
maintained in the welding area.
14. 3    All  welds  shall  be  identified  with  a  code  number
and   cross-referenced   with   the   drawings   for   future
evaluation.

APPENDIX 1
STAINLESS STEEL AND WELDING FUME
NOTICE:    The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  F78.    It  has  been  derived  from  the  cited
documents. Determination of the suitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user.
A1-1     General
A1-1.1   The  fume  generated  when  welding  stainless
steels  includes  respirable  particles,  the  composition  of
whichóparticularly   with   the   flux-shielded   welding
processesósuggests  a  risk  to  cause  cancers.  However,
epidemiological analyses have not identified any actual
risk  specific  to  stainless  steels  but  have  shown  a  slight
excess  of  lung  cancers  among  welders  as  a  whole,  i.e.
both   welders   of   non-alloyed   steels   and   welders   of
stainless  steels,  compared  with  the  general  population.
The cause of this excess has not been identified but may
be   connected   with   factors   incidental   to   welding.
Nevertheless, appropriate precautions to avoid exposure
to  welding  fume  of  all  kinds  are  advisable  and  indeed
necessary if regulatory limits are to be observed.
A1-1.2    There  is  an  important  difference  between  the
chemical  forms  of  chromium  in  fume  from  the  flux
processes  and  from  the  gas-shielded  processes.  In  the
former   group   most   of   the   chromium   is   present   in
hexavalent    form    (chromates),    while    almost    all
chromium   in   fume   produced   by   the   gas-shielded
processes   is   in   the   trivalent   form   and   hexavalent
compounds  are  only  present  in  very  small  proportions.
The   relevance   of   this   difference   is   that,   without
reference to welding, hexavalent chromium compounds
are  classified  as  carcinogenic  to  humans  (Group  1)  by
the  IARC
5
particularly  lung  cancer.  This  fear  is  based
on  the  chemical  composition  of  the  fume,  especially
that produced by the flux processes, and the very small
size  of  the  particles,  which  puts  them  in  the  respirable
range,  i.e.,  capable  of  penetration  down  to  the  level  of
the  lung  alveoli.  Trivalent  chromium  compounds  are
unclassifiable  to  carcinogenicity  to  humans  (Group  3).
Nickel compounds are also classified in Group 1 by the
IARC.

GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS
DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS
This  guideline  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Gases  Committee  and  is  the  direct  responsibility  of
the North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards
Committee on April 11, 2003.  Initially available at www.semi.org June 2003; to be published July 2003.
1  Purpose
1. 1  The purpose of this guideline is to identify resource
information  on  compatibility  of  gases  in  contact  with
silicon  in  the  wetted  path  of  a  gas  delivery  system
operating at typical gas stick conditions.
2  Scope
2. 1      The   information   and   conclusions   provided   are
taken  from  published  literature.    References  are  cited.
No  opinion  is  made  as  to  the  validity  of  the  published
conclusions.  The suggestions are specific to high purity
silicon, single or poly crystal, covered by native oxide.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations (Prescribed Conditions)
3. 1  The guideline applies to the gas distribution system
for a typical semiconductor process tool.  It is assumed
that  silicon  is  in  the  wetted  path  as  a  coating  or  a
silicon-based  component  (eg.  a  valve,  orifice,  sensor,
mass  flow  controller)  in  the  gas  distribution  system.
The  ambient  temperature  and  operating  temperature
limits are typical for the industry.  No additional energy
source,  thermal,  radiative  or  ionizing,  is  present.    The
moisture  content  of  the  gas  is  not  specified  for  the
purpose  of  this  guideline;  the  recommendations  apply
whether or not the conditions are anhydrous.

6. 1  Inerts
6. 1.1  References (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are cited which indicate
these   gases   do   not   react   with   silicon   under   the
prescribed conditions.
6. 2  Hydrogen
6. 2.1  References (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are cited which indicate
these   gases   do   not   react   with   silicon   under   the
prescribed  conditions.    Hydrogen  has  been  reported  to
react  with  silicon  (75)  and  silicon  carbide  (76)  at
temperatures above 1100°C.
6. 3  Hydrocarbons
6. 3.1    References  (1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  55,  56)  are  cited  which
indicate these gases do not react  with  silicon  under  the
prescribed conditions.
6. 4  Halogenated Hydrocarbons
6. 4.1    References  (1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  35,  51,  54,  55,  56,  57,
58, 59) are cited which indicate these gases do not react
with silicon under the prescribed conditions.  Extensive
review  papers  by  Flamm  (55)  and  Coburn  (56)  cite
numerous references on the etching of silicon and other
materials using halogenated hydrocarbons.  The critical
requirement for etching of silicon, or any material using


SEMI F79-0703 © SEMI 2003
2
a   halogenated   hydrocarbon,   is   a   radical   specie   of
fluorine,  chlorine  or  other  halogen.    A  low  pressure
plasma is the typical method of creating this radical.   In
addition,    Winters    (78)    points    out    that    for    an
“unassisted’  etching  reaction  to  take  place  adsorption
onto  the  silicon  surface  must  be  followed  by  four  well
defined steps.  Should any of the steps  not occur, or be
interrupted, etching will not proceed.
6. 4.2      Two   of   the   most   widely   used   halogenated
hydrocarbons  are  CF
4
and  C
4
F
8
.    The  Matheson  Gas
Book  (79)  says  this  about  the  chemical  properties  of
CF
4
,      “...Carbon   tetrafluoride   is   extremely   stable,
reacting  only  slightly    even  at  the  temperature  of  a
carbon arc...”. About C
4
F
8
,  “...Octafluorocyclobutane
is extremely stable. It is unreactive with other materials
under   ordinary   conditions.   At   high   temperatures
(600°C),  it  dissociates  to  form  carbon  and  carbon
tetrafluoride and some toxic compounds...”
6. 5  Hydrides
6. 5.1    References  (1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  64,  65,  66)  are  cited
which  indicate  these  gases  do  not  react  with  silicon
under the prescribed conditions.
6. 6  Halogens, other than fluorine
6. 6.1      The   halogens   represent   a   special   class   of
materials.    Molecular  or  atomic  chlorine,  iodine  or
bromine  have  been  reported  not  to  etch  silicon  at
temperatures  below  200°C  or  without  the  assistance  of
a plasma (19, 26, 50, 55, 56, 63). Schwartz (74) makes
the comment. “Although Cl
2
chemisorbs spontaneously
on   silicon,   (in   a   plasma)   at   low   temperatures   the
reaction  between  Si  and  Cl  does  not  proceed  to  the
formation of SiCl
4
.  That is, silicon does not etch in Cl
2

except  at  elevated  temperature.”    He  goes  on  to  note:
“...except  in  the  case  of  highly  doped  silicon,  etching
occurs  at  low  temperatures  in  the  reactive  ion  etching
system  not  because  of  the  ease  of  Cl  attachment  but
because   partially   reacted   silicon   can   be   sputtered
readily.”    Schwartz  then  reports  the  observation  that
there was no perceptible etching after thirty minutes in
a  Cl
2
plasma  when  there  was  no  cathode  bias  on  the
wafer; in contrast to 4.5 microns of  removal when the
bias was applied.
6. 6.2    Flamm  (55)  published  in  1981  and  titled  “The
Design    of    Plasma    Etchants”,    states,    ”...Chlorine
containing  halocarbon  feed  gases  are  frequently  used
instead  of  Cl
2
because  they  are  not  hazardous  (before
reaction), are noncorrosive, and they decompose in the
plasma  to  generate  radicals  (in  addition  to  chlorine
atoms)   which   induce   some   desired   effects.”   This
statement  applies  to  a  plasma  based  system;  Flamm  is
pointing  out  the  difficulty  of  etching  silicon  with  just
Cl
2
or  Br
2
in  a  plasma.    He  points  out  that  Wang  and
Maydan  (from a private communication in 1979) have
etched  silicon  in  a  pure  Cl
2
plasma  at  pressures  below
0. 05 torr.
6. 6.3  Flamm  goes  on  to  say  that,  “...It  seems  that
chlorine and bromine atoms do not spontaneously etch
SiO
2
or undoped single crystal silicon but do etch some
forms  of  polycrystalline  silicon  and  heavily  n-doped
single crystal and polycrystalline silicon...”
6. 6.4  A conclusion here is that even with a plasma Cl
2

and  Br
2
require  very  specialized  conditions  to  etch
silicon.
6. 7  Halides, Other Than Fluorides
6. 7.1  Gaseous mixtures of HCl, HBr or HI will not etch
silicon  at  the  prescribed  conditions  (1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  62).
However, mild pitting of the silicon may be observed in
HBr or HI under aqueous conditions (5).  In laboratory
testing  (10)  no  reaction  of  the  silicon  was  noted  with
50% aqueous HBr after 45 days immersion.
6. 7.2    One  reason  for  the  lack  of  reactivity  of  silicon
with  chlorine,  bromine  or  iodine  halides  is  the  low
vapor  pressure  of  the  reaction  product.    SiCl
4
has  the
lowest  boiling  point  at  57°C;  SiBr
4
boils  at  154°C  and
SiI
4
at  286°C.    On  the  other  hand,  the  boiling  point  of
SiF
4
is  –86°C.    Practical  advantages  of  this  low  vapor
pressure   and   non-reactivity   were   demonstrated   by
Texas  Instruments  in  their  patents  (24,  25)  on  RIE
etching;  controlled  additions  of  HBr,  HI,  BCl
3
,  among
other gases, led to passivating films of SiBr
4
, etc. on the
silicon  side  walls  and  allowed  vertical  wall  etching  to
be achieved.
6. 7.3    The  moisture  content  of  the  gas  stream  can  be  a
critical   factor   in   the   corrosion   resistance   of   most
materials.    Typical  stainless  steel  passivity  is  strongly
dependent  upon  the  amount  of  H
2
O  present,  declining
sharply  as  water  content  increases  above  1  ppm  in  the
presence  of  halogens  or  halides  (6,  9,  10,  72).    Paciej
(72)  reported  that  0.1  ppm  moisture  in  HCl  does  not
attack  316L  stainless,  while  200  ppm  moisture  in  HCl
can  significantly  corrode  the  surface  of  this  material.
Fine (9) points out similar behavior for 316L in HBr at
0. 5  ppm  and  100  ppm  moisture  over  the  course  of  10
days.
6. 7.4    However,  silicon  corrosion  resistance  is  virtually
unaffected  by  moisture  content  up  to  and  including
aqueous   solutions.      The   “RCA   clean”   (67)   and
conventional   wet   etches   (60,   68,   69)   are   obvious
examples of this.
6. 7.5  Silicon based halides, such as SiCl
4
, SiH
2
Cl

, etc.
have  not  been  reported  to  react  with  silicon  under  the
prescribed conditions. (55)

6. 8  Fluorine and Fluorides
6. 8.1    It  is  documented  that  fluorine  (F
2
)  and  atomic
fluorine, F, will attack silicon at room temperature (19,
22, 26, 42, 49).
6. 8.2      Chen   (49)   used   fluorine   gas   (F
2
)   at   room
temperature on freshly cleaned silicon;  he measured an
etch rate of about 100A°/min at 2.3 torr and 5 sccm of
F
2
flowing.      He   also   noted   a   two   to   three   hour
incubation   period   before   the   etching   started;      the
authors  speculate  about  the  causes  for  this  incubation
period.
6. 8.3    Flamm  (42)  and  Vasile  (22)  authored  several
papers  detailing  the  mechanisms  involved  in  atomic
fluorine  reacting  with  silicon.    Flamm’s  data  produced
the  following  relation  for  the  etch  rate  of  silicon  by
atomic fluorine.

F
=  2.9*10
15
atoms/cc  ,  the
etch rate is reported to be about 3,000 A°/min at 25°C.
6. 8.5  Flamm used an RF discharge of at least 3.8 watts
to produce F from F
2
.   Vasile used thermal dissociation
of  F
2
to  produce  F;    at  800°C  he  measured  47%
dissociation; below 650°C , negligible.
6. 8.6  Flamm (55) also reports a similar relation for the
etch   rate   of   SiO
2
by   atomic   fluorine:   R(SiO
2
)   =

where E

6. 8.7  Flamm   (55)   states “...Fluorine   atoms   react
spontaneously with all forms of silicon, SiO
2
and silicon
nitride to form volatile products.”
6. 8.8          Ibbotson     (19)     examined     potential     etching
processes  which  required  no  external  energy  sources.
“Silicon  is  rapidly  etched  by  the  gas-phase  halogen
fluorides ClF
3
, BrF
3
, BrF
5
, and IF
5
, in analogy to XeF
2

etching silicon..... By contrast, ClF and Groups III and
V  fluorides  such  as  NF
3
,  BF
3
,  PF
3
and  PF
5
do  not
spontaneously  etch  either  Si  or  SiO
2
under  the  same
experimental conditions.”
6. 8.9    Winters  (21)  and  Ibbotson  (20)  report  that  XeF
2

does not etch SiO
2
.  Regardless, silicon, with or without
additional  oxide,  is  not  recommended  for  use  with  F
2
,
XeF
2
,  ClF
3
and  the  other  fluorine  containing  inter-
halogens   which   may   spontaneously   decompose   to
atomic fluorine at temperatures below 200°C.
6. 8.10      As   quoted   from   Ibbotson’s   article   above,
excluded from this list of reactive gases are compounds
such   as   NF
3
,   BF
3
,  PF
3
and   PF
5
which  have  been
reported not to etch Si or SiO
2
without the assistance of
a  plasma  or  RF  source  (19)  or  require  temperatures
above 200°C (1, 35, 37, 38).
6. 8.11  The ionized fluorine atom, F
-
, is reported to not
react with silicon under the prescribed conditions (1, 2,
3,  4,  5,  19,  64,  65,  66).    Further  evidence  of  this  is  the
fact  that  adding  H
2
to  fluorine  containing  plasmas
reduces the etch rate (55).  The assumed mechanism is
the removal of F atoms as active species.
6. 8.12    Other  fluoride  compounds,  such  as  SF
6
,  which
do  not  spontaneously  decompose  to  atomic  fluorine
below  200°C  are  not  a  source  of  reaction  (33,  34,  52,
53, 55).
6. 8.13  WF
6
is  a  special  case.    Numerous  articles  (41
,43, 44, 45, 46, 47) have been published on the CVD of
tungsten  films  from  WF
6
.    Two  primary  mechanisms
are  cited;  the  reduction  of  WF
6
by  silicon  and  the
thermal decomposition in the presence of H
2
.  As stated
in Yarmoff’s paper (43):
“The  dissociative  chemisorption  of  WF
6
on  Si  (111)
was  found  to  be  complete,  even  at  room  temperature.
The  reaction  is  self-poisoning  at  room  temperature,
however  as  the  fluorine  liberated  from  WF
6
ties  up  the
active Si sites responsible for the dissociation.”
6. 8.14    Tsao  (41)  reports  that  at  410°C  only  200A°  of
W  will  deposit  from  WF
6
onto  single  crystal  silicon
which  has  an  oxide  thickness  between  5  and  15  A°.
C.A. van der Jeugel (46) describes the effect of doping
levels  on  the  self-limiting  growth  of  tungsten  films.    It
is documented (44, 45, 47) that WF
6
will not deposit on
SiO
2
without  the  addition  of  hydrogen  or  some  other
initiation mechanism.
6. 8.15    Using  the  selective  deposition  characteristic  of
WF
6
in  a  device,  Fleming,  et.al.  have  patented  (48)  a
technique   for   producing   wear   resistant   coatings   of
tungsten.    Their  invention  requires  a  “clean”  surface
and a temperature higher than 200°C, preferably around
450°C;   exposure   to   WF
6
then   results   in   a   self-
terminating film of 5–50 nm.
6. 8.15.1    Zdunek  (80)    reported    on  electrochemical
based  work  which  indicated  that  unprotected  silicon
surfaces  exhibited  “no  degradation”  after    exposure  to
WF
6
for 5 days at 80°C.  A similar result was observed
for Cl
2
gas.
6. 8.16    As  a  point  of  interest,  metals  such  as  stainless
steel,  aluminum  and  nickel  develop  corrosion  resistant
coatings  of  the  respective  fluoride  when  exposed  to
atomic fluorine during the proper passivation procedure
(14, 23, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 35, 39, 40).
6. 8.17      Titanium,   molybdenum,   tungsten,   brass   and
columbium   have   been   reported   to   be   unacceptable
when exposed to gases such as ClF
3
, which decompose
to atomic fluorine (27, 32).

In summary, it is recommended that neither silicon,
silicon  dioxide  nor  silicon  nitride  be  in  the  wetted
path  when  fluorine,  F
2
,  or  the  halogen  fluorides,
ClF
3
, BrF
3
, BrF
5
, and IF
5
, plus XeF
2
are in use.
6. 9  Organo-metallic and Siloxanes
6. 9.1    References  (1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  64,  65,  66)  are  cited
which  indicate  these  compounds  do  not  react  with
silicon under the prescribed conditions.
6. 10  Oxygen and Oxides and Sulfides
6. 10.1    References  (1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  64,  65,  66)  are  cited
which  indicate  these  gases  do  not  react  with  silicon
under the prescribed conditions.
6. 11  Nitrogen and Nitrogen Compounds
6. 11.1    References  (1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  64,  65,  66)  are  cited
which  indicate  these  gases  do  not  react  with  silicon
under the prescribed conditions.
6. 12  Acids
6. 12.1    Aqueous  HF  is  the  only  single  acid  reported  to
etch  silicon  (70).    Combinations  of  fluoride  ions  in
solution  with  an  oxidizing  acid  such  as  HNO
3
in  an
aqueous  solution  will  etch  silicon  at  practical  rates  (5,
54, 60, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69).
6. 12.2    Madou  (70)  has  an  excellent  review  of  the
mechanisms  required  for  aqueous  based  etching;  he
cites   Hu   and   Kerr   (72)   to   report   an   etch   rate   of
0. 3°A/min. for n-type, 2 ohm-cm (111) silicon in a 48%
HF  solution  at  25°C.    Madou  points  out  the  strong
dependence of etch rate in aqueous solutions on doping
level, light conditions and relative potential.
NOTE 1:  Most bases will etch silicon and silicon dioxide; the
oxide is etched very slowly.
6. 13  Other
6. 13.1    As  currently  designated  these  are  materials  in
SEMI    E52-0302    not    encountered    in    mass    flow
controllers under typical conditions.  The manufacturer
should be consulted.

5  Terminology
5. 1  Abbreviations and Acronyms (See Figure 1.)
5. 1.1  APIMS — Atmospheric Pressure Ionization Mass
Spectrometer
5. 2  Definitions
5. 2.1  purge   efficiency   —   the   ratio   of   process   gas
concentration before and after the purge event.
5. 2.2  required  concentration  —  a  concentration  that  a
user of the gas delivery system required.
6  Condition
6. 1  Test shall be performed at 22°C ± 4°C.
6. 2  Test gas shall be used for measuring equipment and
shall not be adsorptive gas. Two gases shall be used as
the  test  gases.  They  are  indicated  as  Gas  A  and  Gas  B
in this test method.
6. 3    APIMS  or  measuring  equipment  that  has  a  low
detectable  limit  and  has  a  good  response  capability  of
gas densitometer.
NOTE    1:        APIMS    is    widely    used    for    this    type    of
measurement.
NOTE  2:    Qmass  is  not  considered  as  a  recommended  option
as the following reasons; (1) Special sampling valve needs to
be  installed  on  the  testing  equipment.  (2)  Detectable  limit  of
Qmass is high.
NOTE  3:    An  oximeter  is  not  considered  as  a  recommended
option because it does not have enough capability of response.

NOTE   2:      The   through   hole   of   the   sealing   port   will   be
elliptical  if  the  through  hole  is  drilled  at  an  angle.    In  this
case,  the  diameter  shall  apply  to  the  major  diameter  of  the
ellipse.
6. 2  Material —  The  material  used  to  manufacture  the
base of the components shall comply to SEMI F20 with
the  exception  that  the  sulfur  content  shall  comply  to
SEMI E49.9.
NOTE 3:  SEMI E49.9 was withdrawn.  However, a ballot to
combine   E49.8   and   E49.9   in   one   single   standard   was
submitted for SEMICON West 2003.
6. 3  Burrs   and   Sharp   Edges   —   Unless   specifically
noted on the drawing, remove all burrs and sharp edges.
6. 4  Displays  —  Removable  displays  shall  stay  within
the  maximum  envelope  of  the  base  of  the  component.
They  shall  be  movable  or  removable  such  that  they  do
not  interfere  with  the  access  of  the  mounting  fasteners
from above.
