Some risk estimates are based\non identifying the observed and reasonably foreseeable\noutcomes  from  a  hazard  and  assigning  an  expected\nfrequency   to   each   (see   Section   6.5.2).   Other   risk\nestimates  are  obtained  by  comparing  the  equipment\nqualitatively to similar equipment (see Section 6.5.3).\n6. 5.2  The risk estimation using outcome and frequency\nconsists of several parts:\n6. 5.2.1    Identification  of  each  observed  or  reasonably\nforeseeable outcome of a hazard.\n6. 5.2.2      Assignment   of   a   severity   group   to   each\noutcome.

The\npreferred  likelihood  groups  are  given  in  Table  A1-2.\nThe    likelihood,    also    called    the    Probability    of\nOccurrence of Harm can be a function of:\n\u2022 Frequency and duration of exposure to the hazard,\n\u2022 Probability   of   the   occurrence   of   harm   during\nexposure, and\n\u2022 Probability   of   avoiding   harm   during   exposure,\nbased  on  the  presence,  the  extent,  or  the  lack  of\ncontrols.\n6. 5.2.4  Identification of the overall risk associated with\nthe  hazard,  using  a  suitable  table.  The  preferred  risk\ncategory assignments are given in Table A1-3.\n6. 5.2.4.1          The     risk     for     each     severity/likelihood\ncombination should be determined.\n6. 5.2.4.2  The greatest risk from all of the combinations\nshould be considered the overall risk for the hazard.\n6. 5.3  Benchmark     Method     \u2014     Benchmarks     an\nanticipated  or  observed  hazardous  situation  against  a\nsimilar  situation.  Based  on  the  circumstances  in  which\nthe  hazard  occurs,  a  risk  category  (Very  High  to  Very\nLow) is assigned to the risk.\nNOTE   7:      Benchmarking   method   should   only   be   used   if\nsufficient  adequate  and  reliable  information  is  available  on  a\nsimilar model or situation.\n6. 6  Risk Evaluation\n6. 6.1    Each  hazard  or  set  of  hazards  is  evaluated  to\ndecide if risk reduction is needed.\n6. 6.2    Risk  evaluation  can  be  an  individual  internal\nprocess    for    the    equipment    manufacturer    or    the\nequipment user, or a joint effort by all involved parties.\nNOTE 8:  This document does not establish a level of risk for\nwhich   reduction   is   required.

Each\ntechnique  has  its  own  limitation  or  is  developed  for  a  special  type  of  risk  assessment.  For  each  technique  a  short\ndescription of the technique and a reference, if available, is given. Of course, it is not possible to list all techniques\nin this overview.\nR2-1.1.2  Analysis  techniques:  the  choice  of  analysis  technique  depends  upon  the  goal  of  the  analysis.  Two  basic\ntypes of techniques exist:\nR2-1.1.2.1    Top-down  (deductive)  techniques  are  suitable  for  determining  the  initiating  events  that  can  lead  to\nidentify top events, and calculating the probability of top events from the probability of the initiating events. They\ncan also be used to investigate the consequences of identified multiple failures. An Example of top-down techniques\nis Fault Tree Analysis (FTA, see IEC 61025).\nR2-1.1.2.2    Bottom-up  (inductive)  techniques  are  suitable  for  investigating  the  consequence  of  identified  single\nfailures.  Examples  of  bottom-up  techniques  are  Failure  Modes  and  Effects  Analysis  (FMEA,  see  IEC  812)  and\nFailure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA, see MIL-STD-1629A).\nTable R2-1  Overview of Analysis Techniques and Area of Use\nWhen to use Where to Use Technique\nBefore\nmalfunction\nAfter\nmalfunction\nProcess         Work         place         Machine         Organization\nWork Safety analysis X - - X - -\nWhat-If                                    X                                    -                                    X                                    X                                    X                                    -\nMORT                                     X                                     X                                     -                                     -                                     -                                     X\nChecklists                                  X                                  X                                  X                                  X                                  X                                  X\nAction Error Analysis X - - - X -\nHAZOP                                    X                                    -                                    X                                    -                                    X                                    -\nFMEA                                     X                                     -                                     X                                     -                                     X                                     -\nEvent Tree Analysis X - X X X -\nFault Tree Analysis X X X X X -\nCircuit Logic Analysis X X X - - -\nInterface Analysis X - X - X -\nMapping                                   X                                   -                                   -                                   -                                   X                                   -\nProcedure Analysis X X - X - X\nContingency Analysis X - - X - X\nMathematical Malfunction analysis X - X X X -\nWork Space analysis X  - X - X\nTask Analysis X X - X X -"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S10-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1996, 2003 12\nR2-2  Summary of Risk Assessment\nTechniques\nR2-2.1  Work  Safety  Analysis  \u2014  A  checklist  is  used  to\ncheck    the    working    place    on    criteria    such    as\nenvironment,  ergonomics,  and  organization.

The    failure    mode    is    a\ndescription  of  how  equipment  fails  (e.g.,  open,  closed,\non,  off,  leaks).  The  effect  of  the  failure  mode  is  the\nsystem    response    or    accident    resulting    from    the\nequipment   failure.   FMEA   identifies   single   failure\nmodes   that   either   directly   result   in   or   contribute\nsignificantly  to  an  important  accident.  Human/operator\nerrors  are  generally  not  examined  in  FMEA,  although\nthe  effects  of  a  mis-operation  are  usually  described  by\nan  equipment  failure  mode.  FMEA  is  not  efficient  for\nidentifying combinations of equipment failures that lead\nto  accidents.  The  FMEA  can  be  performed  by  two\nanalysts or a multi-disciplinary team of professionals. A\nFailure    Modes,    Effects    and    Criticality    Analysis\n(FMECA) is an FMEA with criticality rankings (Based\non MIL-STD-1629A).\nR2-2.7  What-if  \u2014  Possible  failures  are  checked  on\npossible   consequences.   A   checklist,   suited   for   the\nequipment to evaluate, may be used.\nR2-2.8  Event Tree Analysis \u2014 Event tree analysis is a\ntechnique  for  evaluating  potential  accident  outcomes\nresulting  from  a  specific  equipment  failure  or  human\nerror  known  as  an  initiating  event.    Event  tree  analysis\nconsiders  operator  response  or  safety  system  response\nto   the   initiating   event   in   determining   the   potential\naccident   outcomes.      The   results   of   the   event   tree\nanalysis  are  accident  sequences,  a  chronological  set  of\nfailures or errors that define an accident.  These results\ndescribe the possible accident outcomes in terms of the\nsequence  of  events  (successes  or  failures  of  safety\nfunctions)  that  follow  an  initiating  event.    Event  tree\nanalysis  is  well  suited  for  operations  that  have  safety\nsystems or emergency procedures in place to respond to\nspecific initiating events.\nNOTE  R2-1:  This  technique  is  also  known  as  Fault  Hazard\nAnalysis.\nR2-2.9  Fault  Tree  Analysis  \u2014  Fault  Tree  Analysis\n(FTA)  focuses  on  one  particular  accident  event  and\nprovides   a   method   for   determining   causes   of   that\naccident  event.  The  fault  tree  itself  is  a  graphic  model\nthat  displays  the  various  combinations  of  equipment\nfaults  and  failures  that  can  result  in  the  accident  event.\nThe  solution  of  the  fault  tree  is  a  list  of  the  sets  of\nequipment  failures  that  are  sufficient  to  result  in  the\naccident  event  of  interest.    The  strength  of  FTA  as  a\nqualitative  tool  is  its  ability  to  break  down  an  accident\ninto  basic  failures.  This  allows  the  safety  analyst  to\nfocus  preventive  measures  on  these  basic  causes  to\nreduce the probability of an accident.\nR2-2.10  Circuit   Logic   Analysis   \u2014   Logic   of   an\nelectrical circuit is checked by making a logic diagram.\nPossible errors are reviewed for their consequences.\nR2-2.11  Interface   Analysis   \u2014   Check   how   process,\nequipment  and  systems  are  connected  to  each  other.\nIdentify the risks of each connection.\nR2-2.12  Mapping  \u2014  The  first  step  in  determining  a\nrisk profile is to develop a checklist of the areas of risk.\nThese   factors   can   be   evaluated   quantitatively   (as\naccurate  measurements)  or  qualitatively  (as  levels  or\ndescriptive  states).  The  second  step  is  carrying  out\nsensitivity   analyses   for   the   quantitatively   assessed\nfactors.\nR2-2.13  Procedure    Analysis     \u2014     Procedures     are\nreviewed  and  checked  if  hazards  occur  in  the  steps  or\nsequence of steps.\nR2-2.14  Contingency      Analysis      \u2014      Contingency\nanalysis   is   a   method   of   treating   uncertainty   that\nexplores  the  effect  on  the  alternatives  of  change  in  the\nenvironment  in  which  the  alternatives  are  to  function.\nThis  is  a  \u201cwhat-if\u201d  type  of  analysis,  with  the  what-ifs\nbeing external to the alternative.\nR2-2.15  Mathematical     Malfunction     Analysis     \u2014\nIdentification  of  malfunctions,  deviations  in  design  are\nmade and the effect calculated.

In\nthis  method,  \u201cnon-hazardous\u201d  level  is  determined  by\nassessment  of  the  risk  posed  by  potential  exposure  to\nthe   contaminant(s).   (This   method   is   based   on   the\nassumptions that 1) the exposed portions of a worker\u2019s\nbody  collect  a  single  layer  of  the  contaminant,  with  a\ndensity  half  that  of  the  layer  on  the  contaminated\nsurface,   in   the   course   of   a   day   and   that   2)   this\ncontaminant is then incorporated, at the end of the day,\ninto  the  body  by  either  absorption  or  ingestion.)  This\nmethod    is,    therefore,    probably    inappropriate    for\ncontaminants  which  are  absorbed  rapidly  throughout\nthe day.\nR2-1.1  Toxicity criteria are determined for each of the\nchemicals identified as potentially leaving a residue. As\nan  example,  toxicity  criteria  used  are  reference  doses\n(RfDs)  for  human  uptake  of  chemicals  (US  EPA\u2019s\nIntegrated  Risk  Information  System,  1996),  and  no\nsignificant    risk    levels    (NSRLs)    defined    under\nCalifornia\u2019s     Safe     Drinking     Water     and     Toxic\nEnforcement   Act   of   1986   (Proposition   65).   Daily\nexposures  to  the  RfD  (expressed  in  mg/kg-day)  over  a\nlifetime are not expected to cause adverse health effects\n(non-cancer   effects).   Daily   exposure   to   the   NSRL\n(\u03bcg/day)  over  a  lifetime  are  considered  to  pose  an\ninsignificant  (less  than  1  in  100,000)  increased  cancer\nor reproductive risk.\nR2-1.2   Oral   and   dermal   exposures   are   considered.\nDermal  exposure  is  assumed  to  occur  through  direct\ncontact  with  contaminated  work  surfaces  (i.e.,  hands,\narms,  and  face).

This  is  approximately\nequivalent to a person ingesting all of the chemical that contacts the palms of the hands, but not the backs. Contact\nefficiency  (CE)  refers  to  the  fraction  of  chemical  that  is  removed  from  the  contaminated  surface  through  contact\nwith the skin. It is assumed that no more than 50% of the chemical contamination from equipment will rub off the\nsurface and adhere to the skin. Oral and dermal absorption factors are chosen as the most conservative numbers due\nto limited available data.\nThe  exposure  factor  (EF)  represents  the  fraction  of  time  that  a  person  could  be  expected  to  be  in  contact  with\nchemical contamination from exposed surfaces. Exposure to surfaces is assumed to follow an occupational exposure\nscenario. This scenario includes the following conservative assumptions:\n\u2022 A person works at the facility for 40 years of a 70-year lifetime;\n\u2022 Exposure occurs 250 days per year (365 days);\n\u2022 The skin is in contact with the chemicals for 12 hours per day. This assumes that the chemicals are not removed\nfrom the skin until washed, and the skin is washed only once per day.\nR2-1.4  The final HBCL for each chemical is then the lower of the levels for oral or dermal exposure routes.\nNOTE:  These  HBCLs  represent  levels  that  are  considered  to  be  health-protective  for  a  person  who  contacts  equipment  with\nresidual contamination on a daily basis.
