However,  diameter  correction  factors\nare     usually     required     for     off-center     resistivity\nmeasurements  made  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF81.\nWhen required, diameter measurements should be made\nat the positions outlined in SEMI MF2074.\n8. 4\nAxial  Resistivity  Uniformity  \u2014  The  uniformity  of\nthe resistivity along the crystal axis is important for all\napplications   in   which   the   sampling   volume   of   the\nmeasuring  instrument  in  the  direction  perpendicular  to\nthe wafer surface is different from that of the certifying\nor   calibrating   instrument.      In   addition,   gross   axial\nuniformity along a crystal section may be ascertained in\norder  to  qualify  the  section  as  a  source  of  resistivity\nreference  wafers  of  a  particular  resistivity  prior  to\nslicing the section.\n8. 4.1  Very  crude  indications  of  the  range  of  center-\npoint   resistivity   within   a   crystal   section   may   be\nobtained  from  measurements  made  on  the  ends  of  the\nsection  in  accordance  with  the  Four-probe  Method  of\nSEMI  MF43.    While  these  measurements  provide  a\nuseful  preliminary  screen  for  the  crystal  section,  they\ncannot   be   relied   upon   to   give   accurate   values   of\nresistivity.\n8. 4.2  Somewhat    more    accurate    but    still    gross\nindications   of   axial   resistivity   uniformity   may   be\nobtained  from  measurements  of  the  resistivity  at  the\ncenter  of  wafers  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF84  as  a\nfunction of position along the crystal section.  However,\nbecause of local fluctuations in dopant incorporation as\nthe  crystal  was  grown,  this  procedure  does  not  yield\nreliable information about the center-point resistivity of\nany wafer that is not measured.  In addition, it does not\nyield information about the local variation in resistivity\nas  a  function  of  depth  from  the  wafer  surface,  even  if\ncenter-point resistivity measurements are made on each\nwafer in the section.\n8. 4.3  For   use   in   connection   with   measurements   in\nwhich  the  sampling  volume  differs  from  the  sampling\nvolume   of   an   in-line   four-point   probe   with   1.59\n","[10/(2\u03c0)]","  mm  spacing  as  specified  in  SEMI  MF84,\ntransfer   accuracy   is   affected   by   local   resistivity\nuniformity.    In  particular,  the  resistivity  in  the  near-\nsurface   region   sampled   by   spreading   resistance   or\nmercury   probes   may   differ   significantly   from   the\naverage  resistivity  of  the  resistivity  reference  wafer.\nDepth profiles of resistivity near the wafer surface may\nbe obtained from spreading resistance measurements on\nbeveled sections in accordance with SEMI MF672.  To\nobtain  depth  profiles  across  the  entire  wafer,  spreading\nresistance  measurements  can  be  made  on  a  cleaved  or\npolished   perpendicular   section;   special   fixtures   are\nrequired for these measurements, which do not provide\nthe depth resolution of an angle beveled section.  Since\nrelative   measurements   only   are   required,   accurate\ncalibration  of  the  spreading  resistance  probe  is  not\nnecessary;   however,   linearity   is   important.      Two\ndifficulties  with  this  approach  must  be  recognized.\nFirst,    if    beveled    specimens    are    employed,    the\npossibility   of   mixing   the   vertical   and   horizontal\nresistivity   variations   must   be   considered.      Second,\nbecause   the   method   is   destructive,   the   resistivity\nvariation  of  the  actual  material  being  used  for  the\nresistivity    reference    wafer    cannot    be    determined\ndirectly  at  the  center  of  a  resistivity  reference  wafer;  it\ncan  only  be  inferred  from  measurements  on  nearby\nsections or adjacent wafers.\n8. 5\nRadial Resistivity Uniformity \u2014 The uniformity of\nthe   resistivity   along   the   surface   of   the   resistivity\nreference  wafer  is  important  for  all  applications  in\nwhich  the  measuring  instrument  samples  a  different\narea than the certifying or calibrating instrument.  Since\nall resistivity measurements other than those conducted\nin  accordance  with  SEMI  MF84,  including  four-point\nprobe  measurements  made  with  probes  with  different\nprobe-tip  spacing,  sample  different  areas,  this  factor  is\none  of  the  most  significant  limitations  in  transfer  of\nresistivity values from one instrument to another.\n8. 5.1  Large   scale   (macro)   variations   in   resistivity\nacross  the  surface  of  a  wafer  can  be  measured  with  a\nfour-point probe.\n8. 5.1.1  Coarse indications can be obtained using an in-\nline  four-point  probe  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF81\nmodified to yield a nine-site map of resistivity variation\nover  the  central  38-mm  diameter  region  of  the  wafer.\nIn    addition    to    four-point    probes,    eddy    current\ninstruments      are      frequently      used      for      these\nmeasurements.  Although the procedures for using eddy\ncurrent  instruments  for  measuring  resistivity  variation\nare not standardized, they provide an adequate measure\nof  radial  resistivity  variation,  especially  in  the  central\nregion   of   the   wafer   where   edge   effects   are   not\nsignificant.    Although  more  dense  patterns  may  be\nmeasured,   they   are   very   inconvenient    to    obtain\nmanually  using  either  a  four-point  probe  or  an  eddy\ncurrent instrument.\n8. 5.1.2  Several     commercial     automated     mapping\ninstruments that utilize dual-configuration, in-line, four-"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1527-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2004 8\npoint  probes\n5\nor  square-array  four-point  probes\n7\nare\navailable.    These  instruments  provide  for  collection  of\nsufficient  data  to  enable  determination  of  the  macro-\nscale variation of the sheet resistance in detail adequate\nfor the application.  Measurements should be taken in a\n49-site  pattern  consisting  of  the  center  point  and  sites\non  three  equally  spaced,  concentric  circles  as  specified\nin SEMI MF1618.  In this pattern the inner, middle, and\nouter circles have 8, 16, and 24 sites, respectively.  The\nnominal  diameter  of  the  outer  circle  should  be  38  mm\n(Note  5).    Procedures  for  measurements  with  square-\narray  four-point  probes  have  not  been  standardized.\nDual-configuration    sheet    resistance    measurements\nusing   in-line   four-point   probes   should   be   made   in\naccordance  with  SEMI  MF1529.    Since  the  thickness\ncorrection    factor    is    not    established    for    dual-\nconfiguration     probes,     the     resistivity     at     each\nmeasurement   site   cannot   be   calculated   accurately.\nHowever,    provided    that    the    wafer    thickness    is\nsufficiently    uniform,    determination    of    the    sheet\nresistance   is   adequate   for   this   application   because\nrelative  values  are  all  that  are  required  to  establish  the\nvariation.\n8. 5.2  Micro-scale  variations  in  resistivity  across  the\nsurface  of  a  wafer  can  be  established  by  means  of\nspreading resistance measurements made in accordance\nwith   SEMI   MF525.      It   is   especially   important   to\nminimize  such  variations  in  material  to  be  used  as\nresistivity   reference   wafers   for   spreading   resistance\ncalibrations.  Because of the high density of data points\nrequired to obtain information on micro-scale variations\nover  a  meaningful  area,  long  times  are  required  for\nmaking these measurements.\nNOTE 5:  If it is desired to qualify a larger area of a wafer for\nuse in preparing chip sets for spreading resistance calibration,\nthe  uniformity  of  both  resistivity  and  thickness  should  be\ndetermined   over   the   larger   area   of   the   wafer.      For\ndeterminations  of  macro-scale  radial  resistivity  uniformity,  it\nis  recommended  that,  as  a  minimum,  the  site  density  used  in\nevaluating the central region of the wafer (see Section 8.5.1.2)\nbe  maintained.    Table  1  lists  the  minimum  number  of  sites\nrequired   for   areas   of   various   diameters.      Micro-scale\nvariations should also be determined over the larger area, but\nbecause   it   is   impractical   to   make   detailed   micro-scale\nvariation  measurements  on  each  wafer,  each  chip  should  be\nevaluated for micro-scale resistivity variations prior to use.\n8"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"7  Swartzendruber, L.

Experience\nwith  conditioning  probe  tips  against  materials  such  as  a\nsapphire or non-polished ceramic substrate, or even on a piece\nof  lapped  silicon,  indicates  that  the  microroughness  of  the\nprobe  tip  is  a  very  important,  but  not-readily  specifiable"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1529-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2004 5\nparameter  for  the  proper  probe  type  in  a  given  application.\nThe  combination  of  probe  radius  and  force  that  is  chosen\naffects   both   the   likelihood   of   probe   penetration   and   the\nquality   of   electrical   contact,   which   in   turn   affects   the\nmeasurement noise and accuracy.  A use test is given to aid in\nverifying appropriateness of a given probe for a specific layer\ntype.  Controlled lowering of the probe pins so that contact is\nmade without lateral scrubbing of the probes against the wafer\nsurface has been found to be very important.\n7. 3 Microscope\n7. 3.1 The microscope for inspecting probe damage shall\nhave  a  magnification  of  at  least  600\xd7,  and  an  eyepiece\nmagnification  no  greater  than  15\xd7.    The  microscope\nshall  be  capable  of  dark-field,  interference  contrast,  or\noblique illumination.\n7. 3.2 The  microscope  shall  have  a  stage  capable  of\nmoving  the  specimen  in  order  to  examine  a  number  of\nadjacent damage marks made by each of the four probe\npoints.\n7. 4 Measurement Stage\n7. 4.1 Wafer  Prober Stage  \u2014  With  a  vacuum  chuck  or\ncomparable means of holding the wafer securely during\nmeasurement.      This   vacuum   chuck   should   be   of\nsufficient  thermal  mass  to  keep  the  wafer  at  a  constant\ntemperature,  within  1\xb0C,  during  the  time  required  for\nall  measurements.    The  stage  should  be  provided  with\nstops,   pins,   engraved   circles,   or   other   means   for\naccurately   and   repeatedly   positioning   wafers.      For\nmeasurements   on   wafers   where   the   deposited   or\nfabricated   film   may   extend   over   the   edges   of   the\nsubstrate and make contact to the backside, a thin layer\nof  mica,  or  other  electrical  insulator  must  be  used\nbetween the wafer and the chuck.\n7. 4.2 Probe Assembly Support that allows the probes to\nbe  lowered  onto  the  wafer  surface  with  no  evidence  of\nlateral  movement  (probe  skidding).    This  requirement\ncan  be  verified  by  lowering  and  raising  the  probes  a\nnumber  of  times  onto  a  polished  silicon  surface  with\nsteps of 50 to 100 \u03bcm between these locations, and then\nobserving  the  probe  damage  marks  for  each  of  the\nprobe points with the required microscope.\nNOTE 5:  For  a  probe  with  blunt  tips  or  well-conditioned\nprobe  points,  it  is  generally  very  difficult  to  view  the  probe\ndamage   with   bright   field   illumination;   use   of   dark-field,\nNomarski, or oblique illumination is recommended.  To aid in\nlocating   the   probe   damage,   the   formation   of   a   grid   of\nrectangles, by scribing, etching or other suitable process on a\npolished   wafer   surface,   has   been   found   helpful.      The\nrectangles  should  be  large  enough  to  allow  all  four  probe\npoints  to  be  readily  located  within  the  boundaries  and  a\nnumber  of  probe  impressions  to  be  made  within  the  confines\nof a single rectangle.\n7. 4.3 Wafer  Probe  Stage  with  a  sufficient  range  of\nmotion  to  allow  probing  all  desired  locations  on  the\nlargest  wafers  to  be  measured.    Except  for  restrictions\non   the   exclusion   of   three   probe   spacings   at   the\nperimeter  of  the  layer  being  measured,  the  accuracy  of\nsheet resistance measurements using this test method do\nnot  require  any  particular  accuracy  on  the  position\ncoordinates.\nNOTE 6:  If    this    test    method    is    used    for    referee\nmeasurements,   uncertainty   in   position   coordinates   may\nproduce accurate measurements at the locations measured but\nmay   make   comparison   of   data   more   difficult.      It   is\nrecommended that the wafer be centered on the stage with an\naccuracy  of  1  mm,  or  better,  and  that  all  positions  measured,\nhave  coordinates  controlled  with  an  accuracy  of  10  \u03bcm,  or\nbetter, with respect to the center of the stage.\n7. 4.4 The  wafer  stage  shall  be  instrumented  with  a\ntemperature  monitor  to  be  used  for  any  application\nwhere  the  average  sheet  resistance  of  the  layer  is  a\nparameter  to  be  reported.    The  temperature  monitor\nmay be of any convenient type, but must be accurate to\n0. 3\xb0C, or better.\n7. 5 Electrical Measuring Apparatus\n7. 5.1 The conceptual layout of the electronic circuitry is\nshown in Figure 1 for the case where a standard resistor\nis  used  to  monitor  the  applied  current.    The  standard\nresistor  can  be  omitted  if  the  current  value  is  set  or\nknown directly.\n7. 5.1.1 Constant    DC-Current    Source    \u2014    Having\nsufficient   compliance   voltage   to   supply   a   constant\ncurrent  that  results  in  a  measured  voltage  drop  on  the\nspecimen  that  is  between  5  and  20  mV.    Currents\nbetween  10\n\u22126\nand  10\n\u22122\nA  are  required  if  the  sheet\nresistance  range  1  to  20,000  \u2126  is  to  be  covered.    The\noutput current must be stable to 0.01%, or better, during\nthe time required to take all data at each location; ripple\nand other noise must be less than 0.1% of the dc-current\nlevel.    A  compliance  voltage  in  excess  of  10  V  is\ngenerally  not  needed  unless  measurements  must  be\nmade  through  a  significant  layer  of  oxide  or  other\ndielectric.    A  standard  resistor  (Section  7.5.1.2)  is\nneeded  to  determine  measurement  current  unless  the\ncurrent  supply  is  in  calibration  and  known  to  output  a\ndc-current that is within 0.1% or better of the set-point\nvalue.  A wet or dry battery may be used for the current\nsource  providing  there  is  means  for  regulating  the\noutput current."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1529-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2004 6"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Figure 1\nSchematic of Measurement Circuit Showing Use of a Standard Resistor\nand a Probe Wired for Configuration A"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"NOTE 7:  to   semiconductor   effects   occurring   at   higher\nmeasurement  currents  are  avoided.

Repeat  if  necessary  until\nspecimen  is  free  from  visible  stains,  streaking  or  other\nvisual evidence of residue.\n12. 2 Mounting and Checking the Wafer\n12. 2.1 Using   vacuum   paddle,   tweezers,   or   robotic\narrangement,  mount  the  wafer  on  the  stage,  so  that  the\nwafer center is within 1 mm of the stage center.  Clamp\nthe  wafer  to  the  stage  with  vacuum  or  other  means.\nLower   the   probes   onto   the   wafer.

Thirty  seconds  is\nsufficient   if   the   wafer   had   been   held   at   room\ntemperature   prior   to   mounting.      Longer   times   are\nnecessary  if  the  wafer  was  recently  removed  from  a\nreactor or other elevated temperature process.\nNOTE 10:  The   absolute   value   of   the   wafer   temperature\nduring   measurement   affects   the   absolute   values   of   sheet\nresistance,  particularly  for  lightly  doped  layers,  but  it  should\nnot  affect  the  measurement  of  uniformity  of  sheet  resistance\nvalues,  as  long  as  the  temperature  is  constant  within  0.2\xb0C\nduring  measurement  of  any  wafer.    However,  for  referee\nmeasurements  or  process  control  applications,  for  which  the\nabsolute  sheet  resistance  values  are  likely  to  be  an  important\npart of the measurement results, it is important to maintain the\nstage temperature within a narrow range (e.g., 23 \xb1 1\xb0C) or to\ndevelop  an  empirical  relation  between  sheet  resistance  and\nmeasurement  temperature  for  each  layer  fabrication  process\nof interest.\n12. 3 Measurement    Site    Selection    \u2014    Using    the\nmeasurement   site   selection   agreed   to   for   a   referee\nmeasurement  or  that  decided  upon  for  process  control\nor other application, follow Sections 12.4 through 12.6\nat  each  measurement  site  before  raising  the  probe  and\nmoving to the next site.\nNOTE 11:  Various   site   selection   plans   may   be   chosen\naccording to the application needs.  These include, but are not\nlimited  to:  diameter  scans  with  step  sizes  appropriate  to  the\nspatial resolution needed, sparse sampling extensions of the 5-\npoint  and  9-point  plans  described  in  SEMI  MF81,  and  area\nsampling plans with the size of the area and number of points\nchosen    by    measurement    time    constraints    and    process\ninformation  requirements,  such  as  the  circular  or  rectangular\npatterns  of  SEMI  MF1618.    This  test  method  makes  no\nrecommendation  about  choice  of  sampling  plans,  since  user\nneeds and interests are widely varied.\nNOTE 12:  If  wafer  diameter  scans  are  chosen,  the  probe\nshould  not  be  oriented  so  that  the  pins  lie  exactly  along  the"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1529-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2004 10\ndiameter   being   scanned.      Doing   so   would   risk   noisy\nmeasurements if probes were placed in previous measurement\nlocations.    This  may  be  avoided  by  slightly  misaligning  the\nprobe pins with respect to the diameter.\n12. 4 Measuring  in  Configuration  A  to  Obtain  R\nA\n\u2014\nConnect the probe to the electronics  so  that  the  current\nwill flow through the outer pins (designated Pins 1 and\n4),  and  that  the  specimen  voltage  will  be  measured  by\nthe  digital  voltmeter  (DVM)  using  the  inner  pins  (Pins\n2  and  3),  Figure  4.    Lower  the  probe  into  the  wafer.\nStart   with   the   current   in   either   direction   (called\n\u201cforward\u201d), and adjust the current to obtain a specimen\nvoltage   between   7   and   12   mV,   inclusive.      It   is\nrecommended  that  the  current  value  be  increased  from\nlow  levels  until  the  required  voltage  is  obtained,  rather\nthan  lowering  the  current  from  large  values.    Measure\nthe  current  (using  the  proper  standard  resistor,  or  by\nmonitoring the set point of a calibrated current supply),\nand  the  specimen  voltage,  each  to  a  resolution  of  at\nleast 0.01% of the value.  Record the current reading as\nI\nf(1-4)\n,  and  the  voltage  reading  as  V\nf(2-3)\n.    Reverse  the\ndirection of the current and again measure the specimen\nvoltage and current to the same resolution.  Record the\ncurrent  readings  as  I\nr(1-4)\nand  the  voltage  reading  as\nV\nr(2-3)\n.    The  subscripts  used  for  current  and  voltage  are\nthose  of  the  pins  that  perform  the  current-carrying  and\nvoltage-measuring functions (see Caution, Note 8).\n12. 5 Measuring  in  Configuration  B  to  Obtain  R\nB\n\u2014\nWithout  raising  the  probe  from  the  measurement  site,\nconnect  the  probe  to  the  current  supply  so  the  current\nflows   through   one   of   the   outer   probes,   and   the\nnonadjacent inner probe, Figure 5.  (There are two ways\nof  doing  this  that  should  provide  equivalent  results.)\nConnect  the  remaining  two  probes  to  the  voltmeter,\nmaking sure that the wiring polarity corresponds to that\nused for the connections to the current supply.  With the\ncurrent in the forward direction, measure and record the\ncurrent as I\nf(1-3)\nand the voltage as V\nf(2-4)\n), with the same\nresolution  as  in  Section  12.4.    Reverse  the  direction  of\nthe  current;  measure  and  record  the  current  I\nr(1-3)\nand\nthe voltage as V\nr(2-4)\n.\nNOTE 13:  The notation in Section 12.5 assumes Pins 1 and 3\nwere  used  for  current,  and  Pins  2  and  4  were  used  for\nspecimen voltage measurement.  If the other choice of wiring\nthe   probe   for   Configuration   B   were   used,   the   subscript\nnotation   in   Section   12.5   (and   Section   13.1.2)   would   be\nchanged accordingly.\n12. 6 Moving to the Next Measurement Site\n12. 6.1 Turn  off,  or  short  circuit,  the  output  of  the\ncurrent  supply;  raise  the  probe  and  move  the  stage  to\nthe  next  measurement  site.

A  useful  technique  is\nto  plot  the  values  obtained  for  R\ns\nas  a  time  sequence,\nthat  is,  in  the  order  the  data  for  the  site  were  taken  for\nthese sites.

Examination  may\nalso   reveal   one   or   more   points   that   are   highly\ninconsistent  with  adjacent  points,  possibly  indicating\nproblems   due   to   vibrations   or   spots   of   surface\ncontamination.

For\nthese  tests,  five  types  of  wafers  with  average  sheet\nresistance values from about 15 \u2126 to about 400 \u2126 were\ntested, as detailed in Related Information 1."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1529-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2004 12\n15. 1.1 The wafers in these tests were fabricated by five\ndifferent  processes.    The  purpose  of  these  tests  is  to\ndemonstrate  the  consistency  of  determination  of  sheet\nresistance   uniformity   with   dual-configuration   four-\nprobe  measurements,  not  to  determine  the  uniformity\nachievable  by  a  given  process.    The  five  processes\nutilized are capable of both better and poorer uniformity\nthan seen here.\n15. 1.2 The repeatability of uniformity values given here\nrepresent    good    measurement    practice,    but    the\nconsistency  of  values  for  each  wafer  might  have  been\neven  better  if  all  measurements  had  been  taken  over  a\nshorter time interval.\n15. 1.3 A  standard  deviation,  (in  percent),  was  used  to\nrepresent  the  uniformity  values  obtained  for  each  test\non  each  of  the  wafers.    While  it  is  common  to  give\nrepeatability  values  as  a  standard  deviation,  in  order  to\navoid  confusion  from  duplication  of  terminology,  the\nrepeatability  of  the  repeated  determinations  of  non-\nuniformity for each type wafer are given in Table R1-1\nas the range of standard deviation values obtained in the\noriginal tests.\n15. 1.4 A straightforward propagation of errors based on\nthe performance specifications, in order to estimate the\nprecision,    does    not    appear    possible.        Required\ninstrument resolution, power supply stability, and probe\nperformance   qualification   are   designed   to   allow   a\nrelative  accuracy  and  precision  of  better  than  0.1%  for\nall measurement sites on a wafer.  However, for wafers\nwith  high  uniformity  (for  example,  standard  deviation\nof  all  measurement  site  values  on  the  order  of  0.2%),\neven  these  requirements  may  not  ensure  good  two-\nparty,   or   multilaboratory   agreement   on   the   wafer\nuniformity.\n15. 2 Bias \u2014  A  statement  of  bias  cannot  be  made\nbecause  there  are  no  semiconductor  reference  artifacts\nwith a known level of non-uniformity.\n16  Keywords\n16. 1 epitaxy;      four-point      probe;      ion      implant;\nmetallization; polysilicon; sheet resistance; silicon"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1529-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2004 13\nRELATED INFORMATION 1\nSINGLE LAB TEST RESULTS\nNOTICE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  MF1529.    It  was  derived  from  information\ndeveloped  during  the  original  preparation  of  the  standard  in  ASTM  Committee  F-1  in  1994.    This  related\ninformation was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures on August 16, 2004.\nR1-1  One  wafer  from  each  of  five  different  thin  film\ntypes  was  tested  for  uniformity.    Each  was  100  mm\ndiameter.    A  measurement  test-site  plan  using  81  test\nlocations  located  at  wafer  center  and  on  four  equally\nspaced  circles  with  a  maximum  radius  of  38.1  mm,  as\ndescribed    in    SEMI    MF1618,    was    used    for    all\nmeasurements.        The    measure    of    uniformity    for\nmeasurements on each wafer was the standard deviation\nof the 81 measured values expressed as a percent of the\nmean measured value.  For each of the wafers, 11 to 13\ntests of uniformity were run over periods that ran from\n3 to 6 months, depending on the individual wafer.\nR1-1.1  Temperatures    of    the    wafer    stage    were\nmonitored  and  recorded.    Average  sheet  resistances\nwere  found  to  change  as  a  function  of  temperature  but\nno corresponding corrections of sheet resistance values\nwere  made  because  the  temperature  coefficients  of\nresistivity were not known for the films involved.  The\nassumption   was   made   that   the   determination   of\nuniformity should be minimally affected as long as the\ntemperature stayed relatively constant during the course\nof each measurement run.\nR1-1.2  Results  of  this  test  are  summarized  in  Table\nR1-1.    The  highest  temperatures  used  for  each  wafer\nwere    achieved    by    deliberate    elevation    of    room\ntemperature  in  order  to  determine  whether  temperature\naffected  average  sheet  resistance  or  uniformity  value.\nTemperature  dependence  of  average  sheet  resistance\nwas seen for wafer Types 1, 2 and 5.  No dependence of\nsheet resistance uniformity on temperature was seen.\nR1-2  An  additional  test  involved  three  measurements\nof uniformity on each of three different wafers from the\nsame  five  thin-film  fabrication  processes.    These  tests\nwere  completed  within  three  days.    They  were  also\nassociated    with    evaluation    of    the    repeatability\ncapability    of    the    sheet    resistance    measurement\ninstrumentation.    For  this  evaluation  of  the  instrument,\n50  measurements  were  made  on  each  wafer  by  taking\n10  very  closely  spaced  measurements  in  each  of  five\nrelatively widely separated locations on the wafer.  The\nassumption  was  made  that  in  each  group  of  ten,  the\nmeasurements  were  so  closely  spaced  compared  to  the\nsampling   volume   of   the   four-point   probe   that   any\nvariability experienced was a measure of the equipment\nrepeatability   (imprecision)   and   was   not   caused   by\nvariations    in    the    thin    film    itself.        The    actual\nmeasurements  of  wafer  uniformity  used  the  same  81-\npoint test pattern as used for the wafers in Section R1-1\n.\nR1-2.1  The  measurements  from  this  test,  summarized\nin  Table  R1-2,  show  that  for  each  process,  the  three\nwafers  have  a  different  average  sheet  resistance,  even\nwhen  measured  at  the  same  nominal  temperature  and\nthey also have rather different levels of non-uniformity\nas  determined  from  the  standard  deviations  of  the  81\nmeasurements.      The   variation   of   these   run-to-run\nstandard deviations for a given wafer is seen to be small\ncompared    to    the    typical    wafer-to-wafer    standard\ndeviations for the different wafers from a given process.\nTable R1-1  Summary of Sheet Resistance Uniformity Tests Made by Dual-Configuration Four-Point Probe\nMeasurements at One Laboratory on One Wafer from Each of Five Thin Film Fabrication Processes\nProcess\nNominal\nResistance,\n\u2126\nNumber of Test\nRuns\nRange of\nTemperatures, \xb0C\nRange of Mean\nValues,\n#1\n\u2126\nRange of\nUniformity Values,\n%\n(1)  Boron  Implant"),(0,i.yg)("ol",null,(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"3 \xd7 10\n13\n/60 keV\n570                        13                        19.35\u201328.45                        566.3\u2013574.6                        1.83\u20131.89\n(2)  Phosphorus  Implant\n5 \xd7 10\n14\n/100 keV\n144                        13                        20.21\u201327.73                        143.4\u2013144.4                        0.81\u20130.86\n(3)  Arsenic  Implant\n5 \xd7 10\n15\n/60 keV\n26                         13                         20.94\u201332.48                         26.33\u201326.78                         0.67\u20130.69\n(4)  Polysilicon\n600-nm thickness\n900\xb0 deposition temperature"),(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"5                       11                       21.41\u201326.00                       14.48\u201314.55                       0.24\u20130.24\n(5) n/p-epitaxy 3 \u03bcm/1.2 \u2126 cm\n4,000                      11                      20.23\u201330.92                      4021\u20134301                      1.53\u20131.62\n#1\nMeasurements were not corrected for changes in temperature.")),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1529-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2004 14\nTable R1-2  Uniformity Results from 3 Runs on 3 Waters Each from 5 Different Processes\nProcess Instrument Precision   Wafer Parameter\n#1\nRun 1 Run 2  Run 3\nBoron Implant 0.028% Average Resistance534.8 \u2126                      531.8                      \u2126                    534.1                    \u2126\nWafer 4  Standard Deviation 0.69 % 0.68 % 0.74 %\nTemperature                                   Range26.0\u201326.2\xb0C                                   19.4\u201320.1\xb0C                                   23.4\u201323.9\xb0C\nBoron Implant 0.028% Average Resistance556.4 \u2126                      553.8                      \u2126                    554.7                    \u2126\nWafer 5  Standard Deviation 1.23 % 1.22 % 1.23 %\nTemperature                                   Range25.6\u201325.9\xb0C                                   20.4\u201321.1\xb0C                                   24.2\u201324.7\xb0C\nBoron Implant 0.028% Average Resistance550.7 \u2126                      547.8                      \u2126                    549.7                    \u2126\nWafer 6  Standard Deviation 1.35 % 1.34 % 1.33 %\nTemperature                                   Range25.6\u201326.0\xb0C                                   21.0\u201321.6\xb0C                                   24.6\u201325.0\xb0C\nPhos.
