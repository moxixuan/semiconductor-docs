SEMI M24-1103 © SEMI 1994, 2003 4
5. 2      Items   which   may   be   specified   when   ordering
silicon wafers are listed in attached specification tables.
Not   all   of   these   items   are   required   for   ordering
premium wafers.
6  Dimensions and Permissible Variations
6. 1    The  material  shall  conform  to  the  dimensions  and
dimensional tolerances in attached specification tables.
7  Materials and Manufacture
7. 1    The  material  shall  consist  of  wafers  from  crystals
grown by the process specified in the purchase order or
contract.
8  Physical Requirements
8. 1    The  material  shall  conform  to  the  details  specified
in the purchase order.
9  Sampling
9. 1  Unless  otherwise  specified,  ASTM  Practice  E  122
shall  be  used.  When  so  specified,  appropriate  sample
sizes shall be selected from each lot in accordance with
ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4.  Each  quality  characteristic  shall  be
assigned an acceptable quality level (AQL) and lot total
percent  defective  (LTPD)  value  in  accordance  with
ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4  definitions  for  critical,  major,  and
minor  classifications.  If  desired  and  so  specified  in  the
contract  or  order,  each  of  these  classifications  may
alternatively  be  assigned  cumulative  AQL  and  LTPD
values.  Inspection  levels  shall  be  agreed  upon  between
the supplier and the purchaser.
10  Test Methods
10. 1  Table 1 of SEMI M18 contains a complete listing
of  ASTM,  DIN,  and  JEIDA/JIS  test  methods  that  may
apply   to   the   testing   of   specified   premium   silicon
wafers.  These  attributes  are  listed  in  the  order  they  are
found  in  the  specification  (which  corresponds  to  the
order in SEMI M18).
10. 2  Conductivity  Type —  Use  any  of  the  methods  in
ASTM  Test  Methods  F  42,  JIS  H  0607,  or  DIN  50432
for  confirming  the  conductivity  type  of  silicon  wafers
covered by this specification.
10. 3  Dopant —  Confirm  the  dopant  of  high  resistivity
silicon  by  the  photoluminescence  method  of  ASTM
Test Method F 1389 or by the low-temperature infrared
method of ASTM Test Method F 1630 or DIN 50438/3.
10. 4  Resistivity —  Determine  the  electrical  resistivity
of  the  wafer  in  accordance  with  ASTM  Test  Method  F
673  or  DIN  50445  (eddy  current),  or  ASTM  Test
Method  F  84,  JIS  H  0602,  or  DIN  50431  (four  point
probe) using a suitable fixture to hold the wafer.
10. 5  Carrier  Recombination  Lifetime — Determine  in
accordance with F 1535 or JEIDA 53.
10. 6  Oxygen   Content —   Determine   the   interstitial
oxygen content of wafers with resistivity greater than a
few   ohm-cm   by   infrared   absorption.   ASTM   Test
Method   F   1188   is   the   method   that   was   used   in
analyzing  the  results  of  the  international  round  robin
experiment   that   established   the   IOC-88   conversion
coefficient. DIN 50438/1 provides improved procedures
of  correcting  for  back  surface  roughness  and  multiple
internal reflections. ASTM Test Method F 1619, based
on  work  carried  out  in  JEIDA  (JEIDA  61)  and  SEMI
Japan,   is   an   alternative   procedure   for   significantly
reducing errors associated with these two phenomena.
10. 7  Carbon Content — For all but very heavily doped
epitaxial  substrates,  establish  the  carbon  content  in
accordance  with  ASTM  Test  Method  F  1391,  JEIDA
56, or DIN 50438/2.
10. 8  Total  Bulk  Iron —  No  standardized  test  method
exists for direct determination of total bulk iron content
in  silicon.  ASTM  Test  Method  F  978  can  be  used  for
direct   determination   of   the   electrically   active   iron.
Extensions of the surface photovoltage method (ASTM
Test  Method  F  391)  and  of  the  microwave  lifetime
method   (ASTM   Test   Method   F   1535)   have   been
reported in the literature to provide information on total
bulk  iron  content  of  boron-doped  silicon;  both  these
extensions are based on the iron-boron pairing process.
10. 9  Structural    Characteristics —    When    feasible
observe  crystal  defects  such  as  dislocation  etch  pits,
slip, lineage, twins, etc., in accordance with ASTM Test
Method  F  1725,  JIS  H  0609,  or  DIN  50434.  These
methods  are  destructive,  and  with  the  exception  of  JIS
H  0609  are  based  on  chromium-containing  etchants.
Some    structural    defects,    especially    slip,    can    be
determined    nondestructively    by    means    of    X-ray
topographic  analysis  in  accordance  with  DIN  50443/1.
Swirl  and  oxidation  induced  stacking faults (OSFs) are
best   observed   after   heat   treatment   such   as   those
specified in ASTM Practice F 1726. However, the heat
cycles  in  this  practice  were  developed  for  100  mm
wafers   and   are   not   suitable   for   300   mm   wafers.
Accordingly,  thermal  cycles  used  shall  be  agreed  upon
between  supplier  and  purchaser.  For  observation  of
OSFs,  a  2-hour  heat  treatment  at  1100∞C  in  steam  is
recommended. Observe shallow pits in accordance with
ASTM Practice F 1049.
10. 10  Diameter  —  Diameter  may  be  determined  in
accordance  with  ASTM  Test  Method  F  613  or  DIN
50441/4. Because notched wafers do not have flats, it is
not  necessary  to  make  the  measurements  along  the
particular diameters identified in ASTM Test Method F
613;  rather  it  is  suggested  that  measurements  be  made


SEMI M24-1103 © SEMI 1994, 2003 5
along    the    diameter    perpendicular    to    the    <100>
orientation  fiducial  axis  (0∞  in  the  coordinate  system
specified  in  SEMI  M20),  the  diameter  120∞  counter-
clockwise,  and  the  diameter  240∞  counterclockwise.
However,  a  more  precise  method  of  determining  the
diameter  is  to  find  the  circle  that  best  fits  the  circum-
ference  of  the  wafer  by  a  least  squares  method;  the
diameter of the wafer is twice the radius of this circle.
10. 11  Flat  Orientation —  Determine  in  accordance
with ASTM Test Method F 847.
10. 12  Flat  Length —  Determine  in  accordance  with
ASTM Test Method F 671.
10. 12.1  If  flat  diameter  is  specified  instead  of  flat
length,  determine  in  accordance  with  Section  5.2.1  of
DIN 50441/4 or by a dial gauge method (see NOTE 8)
as agreed upon between supplier and purchaser.
10. 13  Notch  Dimension —  Determine  the  depth  and
angle  of  the  fiducial  notch  in  accordance  with  ASTM
Test  Method  F  1152  with  the  use  of  a  wafer  holding
fixture appropriate for silicon wafers.
10. 14  Notch   Orientation — No test method for
verifying the crystal axis of the orientation fiducial axis
of    notched    wafers    has    yet    been    standardized.
Accordingly,     test     procedures     for     making     this
determination  shall  be  agreed  upon  between  supplier
and purchaser.  A starting point may be an extension of
ASTM Test Method F 847 with fixturing appropriate to
notched wafers.
10. 15  Edge  Profile  Shape —  Determine  the  suitability
of  the  edge  profile  in  accordance  with  ASTM  Test
Method F 928 or DIN 50441/2.
10. 16  Edge  Surface  Finish — Establish  the  surface
finish  of  the  edge  region  of  the  wafer  by  a  method
agreed upon between supplier and purchaser.
10. 17  Thickness, Center Point — Determine thickness,
center   point   may   in   accordance   with   ASTM   Test
Method  F  533,  JIS  H  0611,  or  DIN  50441/1;  special
jigs  or  fixtures  may  be  needed  to  allow  the  probe  to
reach the center point of the wafer.
10. 18  Total   Thickness   Variation —   Determine   in
accordance  with  ASTM  Test  Method  F  533,  ASTM
Test Method F 657, DIN 50441/1, and JIS H 0611.
NOTE 2:  ASTM  Test  Method  F  533,  DIN  50441/1,  and  JIS
H  0611  are  all  5-point  methods,  while  Test  Method  F  657
involves  a  continuous  scan  pattern.  JIS  H  0611  differs  from
ASTM  Test  Method  F  533  and  DIN  50441/1  in  that  the
measurements  in  JIS  H  0611  are  taken  at  the  center  and  at  5
mm from the edge on diameters parallel and perpendicular to
the  major  flat,  while  the  measurements  in  the  latter  two  test
methods are taken at the center and at the same radial distance
(R nominal - 6 mm) on diameters 30 degrees and 120 degrees
counterclockwise  from  the  bisector  to  the  primary  flat  or
notch (with the wafer facing front surface up).
10. 19  Surface  Orientation —  Determine  the  crystal-
lographic orientation of the wafer surface in accordance
with  ASTM  test  methods  F  26,  JEIDA  Method  18,  or
DIN 50433 using a suitable fixture to hold wafer.
10. 20  Bow and Warp — Determine bow in accordance
with ASTM Test Method F 534 and warp in accordance
with ASTM Test Method F 1390 or Test Method F 657.
NOTE    3:        ASTM    has    standardized    two    methods    for
measuring warp. ASTM Test Method F 1390 is an automated,
non-contact  method  which  provides  for  correction  of  the
wafer deflection due to gravitational effects. The scan pattern
covers  the  entire  fixed  quality  area.  ASTM  Test  Method  F
657 is a manual, non-contact method which has a continuous,
prescribed  scan  pattern  which  covers  only  a  portion  of  the
wafer  surface.  There  is  no  provision  for  correction  of  the
wafer  deflection  due  to  gravitational  effects.  As  noted  in
Appendix  2,  different  reference  planes  are  used  for  the  two
methods. Because Test Method F 657 employs a back surface
reference plane, the measured warp may include contributions
from  thickness  variation  of  the  wafer.  Test  Method  F  1390
employs   a   median   surface   reference   plane   and   is   not
susceptible   to   interferences   from   thickness   variations.   In
general,  Test  Method  F  1390  is  preferred,  especially  for
wafers  150  mm  in  diameter  and  larger,  although  ASTM  Test
Method F 1530 may also be used for this determination.
10. 21  Sori — If sori is specified in lieu of bow or warp
or  both,  determine  by  a  method  agreed  upon  between
the supplier and the purchaser.
NOTE  4:    Because  sori  is  a  property  of  the  top  surface  of  an
unclamped  wafer,  it  may  be  measured  on  many  types  of
flatness  measuring  instruments.  ASTM  Test  Method  F  1451
may, in principle, be used for determination of sori.
10. 22  Flatness — Determine by a method agreed upon
between    the    supplier    and    the    purchaser.    It    is
recommended   that   site   flatness   is   determined   in
accordance  with  ASTM  Test  Method  F  1530  using  a
site-by-site  front  surface  reference  (indicated  by  the
acronym SFQR in the Flatness Decision tree (see SEMI
M1, Figure A1-1)). The percent usable area (PUA) shall
be  calculated  as  the  percentage  of  the  total  number  of
full sites within the FQA that meet the specification.
10. 23  Surface   Metal   Contamination —   Determine
surface  metal  contamination  by  a  method  agreed  upon
between supplier and purchaser; ASTM Test Method F
1617  is  suitable  for  sodium  and  aluminum,  and  ASTM
Test  Method  F  1526  is  suitable  for  chromium,  iron,
nickel,  copper,  and  zinc  at  the  specified  levels.  Other,
more   sensitive   methods   may   also   be   utilized   by
agreement between supplier and purchaser.
10. 24  Back Surface Gloss — Determine test method in
accordance with ASTM D523 or JIS Z8741 using a 60
degree of incidence and referencing the zero to a mirror


SEMI M24-1103 © SEMI 1994, 2003 6

results, shall be furnished at the time of shipment.
12. 2    In  the  interest  of  controlling  inspection  costs,  the
supplier  and  the  purchaser  may  agree  that  the  material
shall   be   certified   as   ìcapable   of   meetingî   certain
requirements.  In  this  context,  ìcapable  of  meetingî
shall signify that the supplier is not required to perform
the  appropriate  tests  in  Section  10.  However,  if  the
purchaser  performs  the  test  and  the  material  fails  to
meet  the  requirement,  the  material  may  be  subject  to
rejection.
13  Packing and Marking
13. 1    Special  packing  requirements  shall  be  subject  to

NOTE  1:  Nominal  Edge  Exclusion:  2  mm  can  be  achievable  in  new  300  mm  equipment;  however,  it  will  be  difficult  in  conventional  200  mm
equipment.  Edge  Exclusion  Task  Force  is  now  making  activities  for  developing  a  guide  containing  definition  of  edge  exclusion  when  a
measurement is made over a finite sampling area.
NOTE 2: Wafer ID Marking: SEMI M1 specification shall be applied, if ID mark is applied.
NOTE 3: LLSs: LLSs for particle counting wafer is specified only by the half size of design rule.  These specification values shall be reviewed
when  the  evaluation  techniques  for  distinguishing  particle  and  COP  are  established.    The  nominal  particle  size  can  be  transferred  to  another
particle size using coefficient value and the latter can be applicable for the usage.
NOTE 4: Carrier Recombination Lifetime: Carrier recombination lifetime is affected by carrier concentration (resistivity) and metallic impurities.
Specified resistivity and bulk iron concentration are only necessary conditions for obtaining the specified carrier recombination lifetime.
NOTE 5: Surface Metal Contamination for Furnace and Thermal Process: The proposed specification values are recommended ones considering
NTRS 1997 and current measuring technology and accuracy.
NOTE 6: Surface Metal Contamination for Particle Counting and Lithography & Patterning: The values are proposed considering current process
capabilities and the necessary level for their usage.
NOTE 7: LLSs for Furnace & Thermal Process and Lithography & Patterning: The values are proposed considering current process capabilities
and the necessary level for their usage.
NOTE  8:  The  nominal  particle  size  can  be  transferred  to  another  particle  size  using  coefficient  value  and  the  latter  can  be  applicable  for  the
usage.

NOTE  1:  Nominal  Edge  Exclusion  is  proposed  as  the  same  as  in  Table2  and  as  in  Table3,  however,  more  discussion  will  be  necessary.  Edge
Exclusion Task Force is now making activities for developing a guide containing definition of edge exclusion when a measurement is made over
a finite sampling area.
NOTE 2: Wafer ID Marking: SEMI M1 specification shall be applied, if ID mark is applied.
NOTE 3: Surface Metal Contamination for Furnace and Thermal Process: The specification values are based on ITRS í99 Roadmap.
NOTE 4: Surface Metal Contamination for Particle Counting and Lithography & Patterning: The specified values are based on 180 nm process
requirement in ITRS 1999.
NOTE  5:  Visual  techniques  are  neither  sufficient  nor  appropriate  for  0.13  μm  design  rules.  Automatic  surface  inspection  tools  can  be  used  for
reporting values such as scratches and haze. Test method and standardization for automatic surface inspection tools is under development, visual
inspection is now used as a supplemental method.
NOTE  6:  LLSs  (Localized  Light  Scatterers:  90  nm):  These  specification  values  shall  be  reviewed  when  the  evaluation  techniques  for
distinguishing particle and COP are established. Critical surface LLS size should be the half of CD, however, tools are not well established. 65
nm count limit was transferred to 90 nm count limit using draft international standard: ISO/DIS 14644-1 which follows the equation: 90 nm LLS
counts per wafer = 65 nm LLS counts per wafer /(90 nm /65 nm)
2
.
NOTE  7:  LLSs  for  Furnace  &  Thermal  Process  and  Lithography  &  Patterning:  New  concept  is  proposed  for  LLSs  for  Furnace  and  Thermal
Process.  The  critical  surface  LLS  size  for  prime  wafer  is  proposed  as  a  half  size  of  CD  in  IRTS  Roadmap.  The  half  of  CD  is  not  necessarily
requested for monitor test wafers. In actual business, an additional specification of LLS, the size of which is around CD is used, however, the size
is  not  standardized.  TF  proposes  the  additional  LLS  size  as  the  same  size  as  CD.  This  size  is  used  for  specifying  LLS  for  Furnace  &  Thermal
Process.
NOTE 8: ASTM F47-94 (Discontinued 1998) was replaced by ASTM Guide F1725, and ASTM F416-94 (Discontinued 1998) was replaced by

NOTE 1: Nominal Edge Exclusion is proposed considering future trends referring ITRS Roadmap, however, more discussion will be necessary.
NOTE 2: ASTM F47-94 (Discontinued 1998) was replaced by ASTM Guide F1725, and ASTM F416-94 (Discontinued 1998) was replaced by
ASTM Practice F1727.
NOTE 3: Wafer ID Marking: For 300 mm wafers, Backsurface SEMI T7 mark in accordance with SEMI M1.15 is recommended. For 200mm
Wafers; Various types of ID (or No ID) are prevailed in the market.
NOTE 4: Flatness/Site SFQR(25 ◊ 8mm □

) is proposed referring to the recent ITRS Roadmap discussion and also referring to discussion in Epi
SC for the specification guide for 90 nm node usage.  Two types of scanning stepper are introduced in industry, with the site of 25 ◊ 8 mm □ and
the site of 26 ◊ 8 mm □.
NOTE  5:  Surface  metal  measurement  variation  can  be  significant.  Measured  results  are  frequently  larger  that  the  actual  value.    Processes  are
normally designed and controlled with median values to reduce the impact of measured variation.
NOTE  6:  Visual  techniques  are  neither  sufficient  nor  appropriate  for  90  nm  design  rules.  Automatic  surface  inspection  tools  can  be  used  for
reporting values such as scratches and haze. Test method and standardization for automatic surface inspection tools is under development, visual
inspection is now used as a supplemental method.
NOTE 7: LLSs (Localized Light Scatterers: 65 nm or 50 nm):  Critical surface LLS size is proposed to be the half of CD, however, tools are not
well  established.  Some  measurement  tools  have  capability  to  measure  50  nm  (nearly  1/2  of  CD)  LLS,  however,  some  ones  have  not  enough
capability, so that 50 nm count limit was transferred to 65nm count limit using draft international standard, ISO/DIS 14644-1 which follows the
equation: 65 nm LLS counts per wafer = 50 nm LLS counts per wafer/(65 nm /50 nm )
2
. These specification values shall be reviewed when the
evaluation techniques for distinguishing particle and COP are established and considering production capability.
NOTE  8:  LLSs  for  Furnace  &  Thermal  Process  and  Lithography  &  Patterning:  New  concept  is  proposed  for  LLSs  for  Furnace  and  Thermal
Process.  The  critical  surface  LLS  size  for  prime  wafer  is  proposed  as  a  half  size  of  CD  in  IRTS  Roadmap.  The  half  of  CD  is  not  necessarily


SEMI M24-1103 © SEMI 1994, 2003 18
requested for monitor test wafers. In actual business, an additional specification of LLS, the size of which is around CD is used, however, the size
is  not  standardized.  TF  proposes  the  additional  LLS  size  as  the  same  size  as  CD.  This  size  is  used  for  specifying  LLS  for  Furnace  &  Thermal
Process Wafers.

SEMI M25-95 (Withdrawn 1103)
SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION OF
LIGHT POINT DEFECT WAFER INSPECTION SYSTEMS WITH
RESPECT TO THE DIAMETER OF POLYSTYRENE LATEX SPHERES
NOTICE: This  document  was  balloted  and  approved
for withdrawal in 2003.
1  Purpose
1. 1    This  document  describes  the  specifications  to  be
met  by  bare  silicon  wafers  used  for  calibrating  surface
inspection  systems  with  respect  to  the  diameter  of
polystyrene   latex   spheres.   This   document   does   not
intend   to   establish   manufacturing   procedures   for
calibration wafers.
Note  1:  This  specification  might  be  used  as  the  basis  for
making  calibration  substrates  with  other  materials  and/or
surfaces.
2  Scope
2. 1    Bare  silicon  wafers  on  which  latex-spheres  of  a
known diameter are deposited are used as standards for
the  calibration  of  bare  wafer  inspection  systems.  The
response  curve  of  the  systems  is  generated  for  the
calibration  of  the  systems  with  respect  to  the  sizing  of
polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres, not for counting them.
3  Referenced Documents
3. 1  SEMI Standard
SEMI      M1      —      Specifications      for      Polished
Monocrystalline Silicon Wafers
4  Terminology
4. 1  Light-Point Defect (LPD) — An isolated, localized
effect  on  the  wafer  surface  or  in  the  substrate  wafers
resulting  in  increased  light  scattering  intensity  above  a
threshold (unit LSE).
Note  2:  LPD  is  a  general  term  and  it  includes  for  example
latex spheres and other localized surface irregularities.
4. 2   Latex-Sphere  Equivalent  (LSE)  —  The  size  unit  of
an  LPD  expressed  as  the  diameter  of  a  latex-sphere
which  scatters  the  same  amount  of  light  as  the  LPD.
This  is  indicated  by  adding  “LSE”  to  the  length  unit
used, e.g., 0.2 μm LSE.
Note 3: Sizing may be different for other materials and shapes
than  PSL  spheres  because  of  the  different  optical  designs  of
inspection systems.
4. 3   Response  Curve  (RC)  —  The  relation  between
measured   scattered   light   intensity   and   latex-sphere
diameters  for  a  calibration  surface  inspection  system.
The  RC  depends  on  the  light  source  used  and  may
contain non-monotonic regions.
4. 4  LPD histogram — The distribution of the counts of
LPD’s  per  unit  length  over  their  size  as  expressed  in
LSE.
5  Requirements
5. 1  Substrates — The wafers used as substrates for the
deposition  of  latex-spheres  must  be  bare  silicon  with  a
native   oxide   surface   and   they   have   to   meet   the
requirements  of  SEMI  M1.  In  addition  to  the  M1
specification,   the   surface   conditions   (for   example,
roughness) must be in compliance with Section 5.5.2.
Note  4:  The  substrate  wafer  must  be  measured  before  latex
sphere  deposition  with  the  same  type  of  instrument  to  ensure
that the conditions of 5.5.2 are fulfilled.
5. 2  Latex-Spheres  — The  latex-spheres  used  must  be
certified with respect to their diameter and they must be
traceable to the Standard Reference Materials (SRM) of
the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology
(NIST),  former  National  Bureau  of  Standards  (NBS).
The  certification  methodology  must  be  in  accordance
with the technologies used by NIST.
Note 5 : If the PSL are not traceable to NIST, the certification
method should be fully documented.
5. 3  Range of Latex-Sphere Diameters — The diameters
of   the   latex-spheres   used   for   calibration   must   be
selected so that the measurement range for the intended
application    is    covered.        Sufficient    latex-sphere
diameters   must   be   used   to   achieve   the   required
accuracy of the RC.
Note  6:  For  surface  inspection  systems  using  laser  light
source(s),  it  is  recommended  to  avoid  latex-sphere  diameters
corresponding  approximately  to  the  wavelength  of  the  laser
used and its multiples of the laser used.
5. 4  Density of Latex-Spheres Deposited — The density
of  the  deposited  latex-spheres,  full  or  partial  wafer
coverage, must be selected in such a way that the peak
of the histogram of the latex-sphere diameters is at least
100%  above  the  background  counts.    It  has  to  be
verified   that   the   indicated   (relevant)   peak   in   the
histogram is generated by single, isolated latex-spheres
of  the  specified  diameter.    A  density  of  5–15  latex-
spheres per square centimeter is recommended.
5. 5  Background Contamination



SEMI M25-95 © SEMI 1995, 2003 2
5. 5.1    Calibration  wafers  must  be  handled  and  stored
with great care to avoid contamination and damage.
5. 5.2    The  bell-shaped  peak  in  the  LPD  histogram  of  a
calibration   wafer   which   is   generated   by   the   latex-
spheres  must  be  well-defined  and  must  be  well  above
the background level.  The bell-shaped curve has to go
down to less than 50% of its peak value on both sides of
the  maximum  within  a  diameter  range  of  ±  15%  as
referred to the nominal latex-sphere diameter.
5. 6       Multiple      Deposition      of      Latex-Spheres      —
Deposition of latex-spheres with different, well-defined
diameters  on  a  calibration  wafer  is  allowed  if  all  the
conditions of this specification are met for each kind of
deposited latex-sphere size.
6  Packaging
6. 1    Special  packing  requirements  shall  be  subject  to
agreement  between  the  supplier   and   the   purchaser.
Otherwise  all  wafers  shall  be  handled,  inspected,  and
packed   in   such   a   manner   as   to   avoid   chipping,
scratches,  and  contamination,  and  in  accordance  with
the  best  industry  practices  to  provide  ample  protection
against damage during shipment.
7  Data to Accompany Calibration Wafers
7. 1    Certificate  for  average  and  standard  deviation  of
the  diameter  of  the  latex  spheres  used,  including  the
production lot number of latex-spheres used.
7. 2    Date  of  production  and  certification  of  calibration
wafer.
7. 3  Histogram, as defined above.
7. 4    Approximate  number  of  deposited  latex-spheres  in
a specified area.
7. 5  Wafer identification.
7. 6      Name   and   address   of   the   originator   of   the
calibration wafers.
7. 7  LPD’s wafer map.

more substrates. (SEMI M31)
4. 1.3  label  —  The  label  on  the  wafer  shipping  box
identifying the product and its manufacturer (see SEMI
M45.)
4. 1.4  recycle  —  to  use  an  already  used  item  for  some
other useful purpose. (SEMI M45)
4. 1.5  re-use  —  to  repeat  use  of  an  item  in  its  original
shape for the same purpose as initially intended. (SEMI
M45)
4. 1.6  seam  tape  —  adhesive-coated  tape  employed  to
seal the seam between the cover and the base of a wafer
shipping box.
4. 1.7  secondary container — the outermost box of the
smallest  transport  unit.  Typically  cardboard  boxes  or
similar boxes are used. (SEMI M45)
4. 1.8  shipping   box   —   a   protective   container   for   a
carrier  and/or  wafer(s)  that  is  used  to  ship  wafers  from
the wafer suppliers to their customers. (SEMI M31)
5  Suitability for Re-Use
5. 1    The  ability  to  re-use  wafer  boxes  and  cassettes  is
adversely  affected  by  certain  characteristics.  Some  of
these   characteristics   also   impact   on   the   ability   to
recycle.
5. 2  Wafer Shipping Box
5. 2.1    After  a  customer  has  transferred  an  accepted
wafer  to  a  fab  carrier,  the  wafer  shipping  box  must  be
returned  to  the  supplier  without  having  used  it  for  any
other purpose. The wafer shipping box will be inserted
into  a  bag  sealed  prior  to  return  to  the  wafer  supplier
using  protective  bag  (agreed  upon  by  supplier  and
customer).
5. 2.2         The   wafer   shipping   box   will   maintain   its
dimensional stability throughout its useful life.
5. 2.3    Wafer  shipping  box  materials  will  be  recyclable
after useful life.
5. 2.4  The following characteristics are recommended:
5. 2.4.1    generic  embossed  markings  (e.g.,  model  name,

SPECIFICATION FOR 300 mm SHIPPING BOX
This  specification  was  technically  reapproved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility of the Japanese Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the Japanese Regional
Standards  Committee  on  August  8,  2003.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  September  2003;  to  be
published November 2003. Originally published December 1996.
1  Purpose
1. 1      This   specification   defines   a   container   for   safe
transportation of 300 mm wafers from a wafer maker to
a receiving dock of an IC maker site.
2  Scope
2. 1    This  specification  additionally  defines  the  parts
necessary for a shipping box among cassettes specified
in  SEMI  E57  and  SEMI  E1.9,  within  the  range  of  the

STANDARD TEST METHOD FOR SUBSTITUTIONAL ATOMIC CARBON
CONCENTRATION IN GaAs BY FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED
ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY
1  Purpose
The  purpose  of  this  document  is  to  test  substitutional
atomic   carbon   concentration   in   GaAs   by   Fourier
Transform Infrared Absorption Spectroscopy (FT-IR).
2  Scope
2. 1   This  referee  test  method  cover s  the  determination
of  substitutional  carbon  concentration  in  single  crystal
GaAs.
2. 2     The    useful    range    of    carbon    con centration
measurable  at  room  temperature  by  this  test  method  is
from  the  maximum  amount  of  substitutional  carbon
soluble  in  GaAs  to  1  ×  10
15
cm
-3
.  The  detection  limit
depends on the equipment and measurement conditions.
It  is  expected  that  many  users  of  this  test  method  can
reduce   the   detection   limit   to   10
14
cm
-3
level.   77K
measurement  is  effective  to  reduce  the  detection  limit.
In the case of 77K measurement, the upper limit is 1.3
× 10
16
cm
-3
, as described in the following article:
T.Arai  et  al  :  J.  Electronic  Industry,  Vol.  30,  9
(1988) 38
2. 3   The  test  method  utilizes  the  re lationship  between
carbon  concentration  and  absorption  coefficient  at  580
cm
-1
for  room  temperature  measurement  (around  582
cm
-1
for  77K  measurement),  the  infrared  absorption
band  is  associated  with  substitutional  carbon  in  GaAs.
These  specific  absorption  bands  in  GaAs  have  been
associated with the local vibration mode of C
as
.
2. 4   The  method  is  applicable  to  Se mi-Insulating  (SI)
GaAs.  Slices  can  be  any  crystallographic  orientation
and  should  be  polished  or  lapped  and  etched  on  both
surfaces.
2. 5  This test method is intended to  be used with FT-IR
spectrometers that are equipped to operate in the region
including the wave number range from 700 to 500 cm
-1
.
2. 6   This  standard  may  involve  haz ardous  materials,
operation,   and   equipment.   This   standard   does   not
purport to address all of the safety problems associated
with  its  use.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  user  of  this
standard   to   establish   appropriate   safety   and   health
practices  and  determine  the  applicability  of  regulatory
limitations prior to use.

must be used.  These samples are preserved as
SEMI  Japan,  and  will  be  lent  out  for  determination  of
the     calibration     coefficient     for     specific     FT-IR
spectrometers.
5  Summary of Test Method
5. 1  Test slices are prepared that ar e polished or lapped
and etched on both sides to a thickness from 3 to 6 mm.
5. 2    Apparatus   should   be   calibrated    by   using   the
primary    standard    samples    or    secondary    standard
samples. This calibration coefficient is used to calculate
the carbon concentration of specimens.
5. 3   For  room  temperature  measure ment,  a  baseline  is
drawn  in  the  differential  spectrum  (after  subtraction  of
the    reference    sample    spectrum)    from    which    an
absorption  coefficient  is  derived.  The  range  of  baseline
should be wider than ± 10 cm
-1
. The baseline has to be
determined in an interval of the spectra which is neither
influenced  by  main  peak  at  580  cm
-1
nor  the  side  peak
at   576   cm
-1
.   For   77K   measurement,   the   range   of
baseline should be wider than ± 1.5 cm
-1
.
6  Significance and Use
6. 1     Carbon    plays    an    important    role     in    the
determination  of  the  compensation  mechanism  which
determines  the  semi-insulating  behavior  of  GaAs.  As
such  the  concentration  is  critical  in  determining  the
substrate resistivity.
6. 2   As  a  dominant  acceptor  in  SI-G aAs  substrates,
carbon   could,   potentially   impact   ion   implantation
activation.
7  Interferences
7. 1   Stray  light  that  reaches  the  det ector  will  tend  to
reduce  the  calculated  absorption  coefficient  value  and
thereby reduce the reported carbon concentration.
7. 2   FT-IR  instrument  instruction  m a nuals  should  be
consulted if problems with the technique are suspected.
7. 3   The  carbon  absorption  band  ha lf  width  at  room
temperature  must  be  less  than  2  cm
-1
for  acceptable
measurement  results.  Excessive  width  can  be  due  to
improper thickness matching or stress.
7. 4  Specimens that do not exceed  the instrument beam
size  will  cause  error.  Use  of  apertures,  or  preferably
beam condensers, can correct this problem.
7. 5   The  minimum  detection  level   o f  this  method  is
limited by the signal-to-noise ratio of the recording.
8  Apparatus
8. 1   FT-IR  with  an  operating  range   that  includes  the
region  of  700  to  500  cm
-1
.  Instrument  resolution  or
spectral resolution at the carbon absorption band of 580
cm
-1
for  room  temperature  measurement  and  around
582 cm
-1
for 77K measurement must not exceed 0.5 cm
-
1
,    which    means    the    effective    resolution    after
apodization must not exceed 1.0 cm
-1
.
8. 1.1   Beam  sizes  and  sample  holder   active  areas  for
both  the  specimen  and  the  reference  must  be  within
10% of each other.
8. 2   Instrument  suitable  for  thickne ss  measurement  to
an accuracy of 0.0025 mm.

SEMI M30-0997 © SEMI 19974
8. 3  Holders for these test and refer ence specimens that
prevent any source of infrared radiation from bypassing
the specimen.
8. 4   For  use  at  77K,  low-temperatu re  cryostat  capable
of  maintaining  the  specimen  and  reference  at  77K
temperature  with  suitable  window  materials  (refer  to
ASTM Practice F 120).
8. 5   Equipment  and  materials  for  s licing  and  polishing
GaAs to a final thickness tolerance of 0.005 mm or less,
and a total thickness variation of 0.01 mm or less.
9  Sampling
Unless  otherwise  specified,  a  GaAs  slice  used  for  the
carbon  test  is  to  be  measured  at  the  nominal  slice
center.  And  if  a  slice  is  to  be  reduced  in  area  prior  to
test, it is shaped such that the original slice center area
is that which is tested.
10  Test Specimens
10. 1   A  single  crystal  slice  of  GaAs   with  a  thickness
from 3 to 6 mm must be used for carbon determination.
10. 2  The test specimen must be car efully shaped to the
following criteria:
10. 2.1  Thickness variation over the m easurement area
of 0.005 mm or less.
10. 2.2   Same  surface  preparation  on  b oth  front  and
back   surfaces.   For   room   temperature   measurement,
surface  preparation  of  specimen  should  be  same  with
reference    sample.    For    77K    measurement,    mirror
polishing  on  both  surface  or  same  surface  preparation
with standard sample is recommended.
10. 2.3   Final  thickness  agreement  betw een  specimen
and reference samples of 0.1 mm.
10. 2.4    Surface   area   large   enough   such    that   with
respect  to  the  holders  no  incident  radiation  can  bypass
either specimen or reference.

11. 1     Prepare    FT-IR    in    accordance    w ith    the
manufacture’s instructions.
11. 2   Determine  the  differential  tran smission  spectrum
from  700  to  500  cm
-1
in  accordance  with  of  ASTM
Practice F 120.
11. 2.1  The FWHM must not exceed 2  cm

to achieve
reliable  results.  If  this  is  not  met,  recheck  test  and
reference  specimen  mechanical  properties,  use  slower
scan speed, or longer measuring time, and reverify FT-
IR operating conditions.
11. 2.2    Reference   to   Figure   1   and   Rec ommended
ASTM  Practice  E  168,  Section  7,  for  assistance  in
establishing  a  baseline  on  the  finished  spectrogram.
Baseline   determination   is   very   important   to   this
method,  and  becomes  more  critical  as  the  measured
carbon level decreases (refer to ASTM Practice E 168).
11. 2.3    For   room   temperature   meansu rement,   the
following conditions are recommended:
• Detector : Broadband MCT (or TGS) (see Sections
4. 1.3 and 4.1.4)
• Resolution : 0.5 cm
-1
• S/N ratio : > 3
• Range of wave number : including 700 – 500 cm
-1
• Aperture : Optimum for each FT-IR
• Apodization function : Triangle
• Smoothing : Not applicable
• Reference : Air, reference sample
• Temperature : 290 ~ 300K
11. 2.4   Make  the  determination  at  low   temperature
(77K)  if  increased  sensitivity  is  required.  Follow  the
same  test  conditions  as  described  in  Sections  11.1  and
11. 2 except reference and temperature.
11. 3    Determination   of   the   calibratio n   coefficient
should  be  done  once  or  more  times  per  year.  Four  or
more  secondary  standard  samples  should  be  used  for
this  calibration.  The  user  of  this  method  can  have  and
use   the   internal   standard   samples   to   check   the
spectrometer frequently.

PROVISIONAL MECHANICAL SPECIFICATION FOR FRONT-OPENING
SHIPPING BOX USED TO TRANSPORT AND SHIP 300 mm WAFERS
This provisional specification was technically approved by the global Silicon Wafer Committee.  This edition
was  approved  for  publication  by  the  global  Audits  and  Reviews  Subcommittee  on  May  20,  2005.    It  was
available  at  www.semi.org  in  June  2005  and  on  CD-ROM  in  July  2005.    Originally  published  in  1998;
previously published March 2005.
1  Purpose
1. 1  This  standard  specifies  the  front-opening  shipping  box  (FOSB)  used  to  ship  300  mm  wafers  from  wafer
suppliers to their customers (typically IC manufacturers), while maintaining wafer quality.
NOTE 1:  Refer to SEMI silicon wafer related specifications M-series such as SEMI M1 as for a wafer quality.
2  Scope
2. 1  This  standard  is  intended  to  set  an  appropriate  level  of  specification  that  places  minimal  limits  on  innovation
while  ensuring  modularity  and  interchangeability  at  all  mechanical  interfaces.  However,  this  standard  has  been
written  so  that  injection-molded  plastic  FOSBs  can  be  manufactured  in  conformance  with  it,  and  those  can  be
utilized for maintaining wafers quality during transportation, opening and closing the door.
2. 2  This  standard  assumes  that  the  FOSB  is  used  in  the  last  process  in  wafer  manufacturing,  in  acceptance  and
inspection,  and  in  transferring  the  wafers  from  the  FOSB  to  a  FOUP,  FOBIT  or  open  cassette  inside  an  IC
manufacturing facility. The FOSB is not intended to be used in IC manufacturing processes. It is recommended that
wafers be transferred from the FOSB to a FOUP, FOBIT or open cassette using automated methods. As described in
¶5.4, the purchaser needs to specify which type of FOSB door is required:
1) Manual door as described in ¶5.4.1; or
2) Automated–shippable door as described in ¶5.4.2.
2. 3  This  standard  is  provisional.  This  standard  will  be  modified  and  upgraded  from  provisional  status.  Where
possible, the specified design features are in accord with like features in SEMI E1.9 and SEMI E47.1.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.

5  Requirements
5. 1  The FOSB has the following components and sub-components:
Key:
•     Required     feature
◊     Optional     feature

•     Door     on     front
◊ Manual door (optional)
◊ Automated door (optional)
• Holes for latch keys that lock the door to the SFMI interface when the door is unlatched from the box
• Holes for registration pins
• Door presence sensing areas
•     Top
◊ Top robotic handling flange (optional)
•     Interior
• Cassette with supports for 13 or 25 wafers
•     Wafer     retainer
• 2 end effector exclusion zones
•     Sides
◊     Ergonomic     manual     handles     (optional)
•     Bottom
• 5 carrier sensing pads
•     4     Info     pads
• 3 features that mate with kinematic coupling pins and provide a 10 mm lead-in
◊ 3 features that mate with kinematic coupling pins and provide a 15 mm lead-in (optional)
◊ Retaining features for manual door (optional)
• Retaining features for automated-shippable door
5. 2  Kinematic Couplings — The physical alignment mechanism from the FOSB to the tool load-port (or a nest on a
vehicle or in a stocker) consists of features (not specified in this standard) on the top entity that mate with three or
six  pins  underneath  as  defined  in  SEMI  E57.  The  three  features  that  mate  with  the  kinematic  coupling  pins  must
provide a lead-in capability that corrects a FOSB misalignment of up to r69 in any horizontal direction.


SEMI M31-0705 © SEMI 1998, 2005 4
5. 3  Inner and Outer Radii — All required concave features may have a radius of up to r65 to allow cleaning and to
prevent  contaminant  build-up.  All  required  convex  features  may  also  have  a  radius  of  up  to  r66  to  prevent  small
contact  patches  with  large  stresses  that  might  cause  wear  and  particles.  Note  that  these  limits  on  the  radius  of  all
required features are specified as a maximum (not a minimum) to ensure that the required features are not rounded
off too much. The lower bound on the radius is up to the FOSB supplier. Note also that this radius applies to every
required feature unless another radius is called out specifically. Here a required feature is an area on the surface of
the  FOSB  supplier.  Note  also  that  this  radius  applies  to  every  required  feature  unless  another  radius  is  called  out
specifically. Here a required feature is an area on the surface of the FOSB specified by a dimension (or intersections
of dimensions) that has a tolerance and not just a maximum or minimum (such as the edges of the robotic handling
flange).
5. 4  Door — It is recommended that the FOSB not be vertical when it is opened or closed. When the FOSB is in a
vertical  orientation  with  the  door  removed,  the  wafers  must  be  restrained  from  touching  each  other  by  appropriate
wafer support design or other retaining techniques.
5. 4.1  Manual  Door  —  If  chosen,  the  manual  door  option  requires  no  automation  to  open  the  door.  An  exclusion
zone surrounding the manual door area is specified in the standard. There are several possible techniques for sealing
and  clamping  the  manual  door  that  meet  user  requirements.  Therefore,  only  an  exclusion  zone  surrounding  the
manual door area is specified in this standard. All features of the door and door retaining mechanism must lie within
the  exclusion  zone  illustrated  in  Figure  1  and  must  not  interfere  with  other  specified  features  (including  the
kinematic couplings). Figure 1 and dimensions x81, y50, y81, y82, z47, z48 and z49 define the manual door area and
therefore  apply  only  to  the  manual  door  option  as  described  in  this  section.    The  y81  dimension  applies  from  the
horizontal  datum  plane  to  the  top  surfaces  of  the  FOSB  (z47-z48  or  z47+z49  at  the  upper  door  frame  volume
specified by y50).
5. 4.2  Automated-shippable Door — If chosen, the automated-shippable door must be designed to mate with a port
that conforms to SEMI E62. However, following characteristics of automate-shippable door must be considered.
5. 4.2.1  Wafer  Retaining  Structure  —  The  slot  is  usually  designed  that  wafers  are  suspended  in  the  slot  without
contacting  the  surface  of  the  slot  for  preventing  the  damage  during  transportation  when  FOSB  door  is  closed.  It
should be noted that wafer position of FOSB is different from that of FOUP when the door is closed due to the wafer
retaining structure.
5. 4.2.2  Rear  of  Door (y51)  —  For  manual  door,  FOSB  has  a  y51
≥  50  mm  to  hold  wafers  in  large  area  at  front
wafer  retainer  for  keeping  wafer  quality  during  transportation.  For  automated-shippable  door,  FOSB  has  a
y51≥ 140 mm to comply with SEMI E47.1.
5. 4.2.3  Force  between  Box  Door  and  Box (f34:  defined  by  SEMI  E62)  —  f34  is  related  to  wafer  retaining  force
though,  need  to  consider  door  is  pulled  by  latching  too.  Even  though,  f34  is  increased,  minimum  force  applied  to
wafer would be recommended for eliminating damage to the wafers in dynamic motion for opening and closing the
door.
5. 4.2.4  Latch  Key  Torque  (f30:  defined  by  SEMI  E62)  —  The  required  latch  key  torque  depends  on  the  closing
force.
5. 4.2.5  A FOSB with an automated-shippable door should be able to withstand a force when applied to one of the
retaining features of up to 40N (f61) in any direction without negative impact to the intended function of the FOSB
(e.g. shell deformation, wafer positions, door closing capabilities).
5. 5  Seal Zones for Door — In the Front Opening Shipping Box Automated Door Option the automated box door is
on the front side of the box (corresponding to the front side of the carrier where wafers are accessed so the door is
perpendicular to the wafers and parallel to the facial datum plane).  The automated door and the carrier frame must
have  surfaces  that  mate  with  the  seal  zones  defined  in  SEMI  E62.    Specifically,  the  FOSB  automated  box  door
option and the carrier frame must have surfaces that made with the seal zones and the reserved spaces for vacuum
application (which includes all of the circles bounded by r38 except for the holes for the registrations at the center of
each circle) defined in §5 of SEMI E62 (which specifies r38 as well as the seal zone dimensions).  These automated
door and frame surfaces must be a distance of y52 from the facial datum plane and must have a flatness of y42.  No
surface  on  the  automated  door  may  project  further  from  the  facial  datum  plane  than  the  door  seal  zone  and  the
reserved spaces for vacuum application.  The automated door must also be designed so that when the box is pressed
against the FIMS port, both latch keys on the port are inserted to their full length.  Furthermore, when the latch keys


SEMI M31-0705 © SEMI 1998, 2005 5
are turned more than 45° toward the position that unlocks the automated door from the box, the latch key holes on
the door must be such that the door is not removable from the latch keys.  There are no door seal zone requirements
for the manual door option, but a FOSB with the manual door must contain a frame seal zone that meets the frame
seal zone requirements specified in this section.
5. 6  Wafer Retaining — When the FOSB is closed, the wafers must be retained in the FOSB to prevent movement
during  subsequent  handling,  including  shipping.  It  should  be  noted  that  wafers  are  typically  shipped  in  a  vertical
orientation and generally require support from a secondary package. It is recommended that this secondary package
be designed to allow for easy removal of the FOSB from the secondary package.


Figure 1
Manual Door Area

5. 7  Wafer Orientation and Numbering — The wafers must be horizontal when the FOSB is placed on the coupling,
and the wafers slots are numbered in increasing order from bottom to top (so the bottom wafer is wafer number 1,
the next wafer up is wafer number 2, etc.).
5. 8  Internal  Horizontal  Dimensions  —  Figure  2  shows  a  cross-section  of  the  horizontal  boundaries  of  the  FOSB
side domains (which contain the parts of the FOSB higher than z6 above the horizontal datum plane and lower than
z15  above  the  top  wafer).  In  this  and  following  figures,  the  most  heavy  lines  are  used  for  surfaces  that  have
tolerances (not surfaces that have only maximum or minimum dimensions).

5. 9  Internal Vertical Dimensions — Figures 3 through 7 show the vertical dimensions of the internal FOSB. Note
that z8  (the  height  of  the  bottom  nominal  wafer  seating  plane  above  the  horizontal  datum  plane)  and  z12  (the
distance  between  adjacent  nominal  wafer  seating  planes)  are  given  as  absolute  distances  with  no  tolerance.  This
means that the sum of actual height variations in the FOSB from the kinematic coupling to the supporting features
holding each wafer must be contained within the tolerance of z10 with no further stack-up at each higher wafer. The
method  for  meeting  this  requirement  is  left  up  to  the  FOSB  supplier.  Table  2  defines  all  dimensions  for  Figures  3
through 7.

Upper Cross-Section at Facial Datum Plane

5. 9.1  Wafer Set-Down Volume — The open space for the wafer set-down volume consists of a cylindrical section
with radius r2 and a main axis parallel to and y1 in front of the nominal wafer centerline. The top of this cylindrical
section is z11 above the nominal wafer seating plane and its bottom is z10 above the nominal wafer seating plane.
The  implications  for  wafer  positioning  of  the  tolerance  on  r2  are  as  follows.  The  wafers  should  be  placed  in  the
FOSB within a circle of radius corresponding to the smaller bound on r2 to avoid touching the edge of the wafer to
the side of the FOSB. Once the wafer has been placed, the FOSB must not allow a wafer to move outside of a circle
of radius corresponding to the larger bound on r2. There are two exceptions to this limit on wafer movement. When
the wafer is pushed toward the rear of the FOSB, the location of the wafer is defined by the wafer pick-up volume
(see ¶5.9.3). When the FOSB is gently tilted forward up to 45°, the wafers may slide forward, but it is recommended
that they not extend further than y20 from the facial datum plane. This may be accomplished by designing the teeth
supporting  the  wafers  to  include  a  “wafer  stopper”  at  the  front  that  is  outside  of  r2  and  under  z29  as  illustrated  in
Figure 6.
5. 9.2  Wafer  Extraction  Volume  —  The  open  space  for  the  wafer  extraction  volume  includes  a  cylindrical  section
with radius r3 and a main axis parallel to and y1 in front of the nominal wafer center line. The top of this cylindrical
section is z11 above the nominal wafer seating plane and its bottom is z23 above the nominal wafer seating plane.
The wafer extraction volume also includes the extrusion out the front of the FOSB of this cylindrical section and the
portion  of  the  wafer  set-down  volume  above  z29.  The  implications  for  wafer  extraction  of  the  definition  of
dimension r3  (r3 ≥ r2  +  1)  are  as  follows.  The  FOSB  must  give  an  extra  1  mm  (0.04  in.)  of  horizontal  clearance
once the wafer is picked up from wherever it ends up (within the bounds of r2) after transport in the FOSB.

5. 9.3  Wafer Pick-Up Volume — If a wafer is placed in the wafer set-down volume and is then pushed toward the
rear of the FOSB, then the entire bottom of the wafer must be contained in the wafer pick-up volume. However, if
the  wafer  is  not  pushed  toward  the  rear  of  the  FOSB,  then  the  wafer  may  only  be  somewhere  within  the  wafer
extraction volume. The wafer pick-up volume is defined by a cylindrical section with radius r1 and a main axis at
the nominal wafer centerline. Its top and bottom are the upper and lower tolerance of z10 around the nominal wafer
seating plane.
5. 10  Pitch  and  Capacity  —  Table  1  shows  the  different  options  with  regard  to  the  wafer  pitch  (spacing)  and  the
FOSB capacity. Again, no tolerance is given on the wafer pitch (z12), for reasons given in ¶5.9.

These dimensions are for optional features.

5. 11  External  Dimensions  —  Figures  8  through  12  respectively  show  the  side  view,  rear  view,  top  view,  robotic
flange, and bottom view for the front-opening FOSB. Table 3 defines all of the dimensions. If an identification tag is
used,  it  must  be  located  at  the  bottom  rear  centered  on  the  bilateral  datum  plane  and  must  be  contained  within  the
maximum outer dimensions of the FOSB.
5. 12  Human  Handles  —  All  handles  for  use  by  humans  must  either  be  contained  within  the  maximum  outer
dimensions of the FOSB, be detached when not in use, or be retractable into the maximum outer dimensions when
not  in  use.  Although  such  handles  may  extend  past  x53,  they  must  still  be  contained  within  x50, y40,  and  r67.
Handles  for  use  by  humans  (if  present)  must  follow  SEMI  S8,  and  they  must  require  the  use  of  both  hands  (each
using  a  full  wrap-around  grip,  given  the  minimum  clearance  requirement  in  SEMI  E15.1).  Automation  handling
features shall not be considered dual purpose unless they are designed to meet SEMI S8 guidelines.
5. 13  Automation Handling — On the top of the FOSB, there is an optional robotic handling flange for manipulating
the  FOSB  as  illustrated  in  Figure  12.   On  the  bottom  of  the  FOSB,  there  are  optional  rails  for  use  with  roller
conveyors or forklifts.  Although they are only required to extend y58 to the left and right, it is recommended that
they be as long as possible.  Beyond y58, only the lower bound on z43 apply.  These optional conveyor rails (defined
by x56, x57,  and  z43)  are  located  on  the  left  and  right  bottom  edges  of  the  front-opening  shipping  box.    The
conveyor rails also have vertical cylindrical pin holes for fork lift centering (defined by d65).
