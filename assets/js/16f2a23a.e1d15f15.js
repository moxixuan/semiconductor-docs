Originally published in 1991; previously published in2004. 1 Purpose1.1 Processing systems now employed in advanceddevice manufacturing use aligning mechanisms toposition the wafer rotationally and in x-y prior toprocessing. Many of these scan the wafer peripheryand determine the geometric center of the wafersurface. This is most often seen on stepping aligners, tominimize the effects of wafer-to-wafer diametervariation in mixed aligner type fabs. Similar center-referencing subsystems are found on manycharacterization systems. The wafer coordinate systemprovides a method for referencing any other coordinatesystem, such as a site, pattern, or mapping array, to thephysical geometry of the wafer surface.1.2 If the points of the array lie on the front surface ofthe wafer, only the x and y (or r and ) coordinates arerelevant. It has become increasingly important insemiconductor material and device manufacturing todescribe, in unambiguous terms, the position of a pointon a wafer that automatic processing, test, orcharacterization equipment can recognize and locate.For example, characterization equipment needs toreport the precise locations of defects and anomaliesdiscovered in wafers before or after processing in orderto relate the presence or absence of such defects andanomalies to device yield variations. The wafercoordinate system can be used to establish thecoordinates of each point of interest, and, throughtransformation to the yield analysis coordinate system,relate them to the die yield map.1.3 In response to these needs, this practice defines awafer coordinate system to facilitate the preciselocating and reporting of points on the wafer surface. Ifthe point or points lie above or below the surface, the z-coordinate must also be used. Because the zero pointon the z-axis is application specific, this practice treatsthe x-y-z (or r- -z) system separately from the surfacecoordinate system. 2 Scope2.1 This practice covers procedures for defining awafer coordinate system for locating uniquely any pointon a wafer surface using the wafer center as the originand either Cartesian (x-y) or polar (r-) coordinates. 2.2 For unpatterned wafers, this wafer coordinatesystem can be used directly or in conjunction with arectangular or polar overlay array.2.3 This wafer coordinate system can also be used tolocate the origins or other reference points of othercoordinate systems used to define or report positiondata of site, die, or map arrays on the front or backsurface of a patterned or unpatterned wafer. In thisway, the array coordinate system may be referenced tothe physical geometry of the wafer. Selected modes ofapplication of the wafer coordinate system are given forinformation only in Related Information 1.2.4 This practice also covers procedures for defining athree-dimensional x-y-z (or r- -z) coordinate system forthe wafer.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Mask alignment conventions are not necessarilyconsistent with the wafer coordinate system.3.2 In SEMI M1, the position of the secondary flat onsilicon wafers is defined by the clockwise rotation fromthe primary flat. This is opposite to the conventionused for the polar angle in the wafer coordinate system.3.3 Also in SEMI M1, the coordinate system for theedge profile template is, unlike the wafer coordinatesystem, edge referenced. In addition, the edge profiletemplate uses the x coordinate for the radial direction(positive from the wafer edge inward) and the ycoordinate for the vertical direction (positive from thewafer surface toward the median plane of the wafer).3.4 In SEMI E5, the normal position of the wafer isdefined similarly to that in the wafer coordinate system;that is, the primary fiducial is downward and itsbisector is the negative y-axis. However, the rotationalposition of the wafer is defined by its clockwiserotation from the normal position, again opposite tothe convention used for the polar angle in the wafer"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 3 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M20-1104 \xa9 SEMI 1991, 2004 2 coordinate system. Further, in SEMI E5, the coordinatesystem axes do not rotate; the wafer rotates with respectto these axes. In the wafer coordinate system, thecoordinate axes are referenced to the wafer itself,independent of the physical position of the wafer inspace.3.5 SEMI M12 and SEMI M13 specify the mark fieldlocation for 100 mm, 125 mm, or 150 mm diameterflatted wafers relative to the flat rather than the wafercenter. Thus, the mark field location may vary withrespect to the wafer center and the coordinates of thecorners of the mark field location (in the wafercoordinate system) may vary from wafer to wafer.However, the mark field location for notched wafers150, 200, and 300 mm in diameter is referenced to thewafer center.3.6 There are some circumstances in which the frontsurface of an unpatterned wafer is not readilydistinguished from the back surface. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E5  SEMI Equipment CommunicationsStandard 2 Message Content (SECS-II)SEMI M1  Specifications for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI M12  Specifications for Serial AlphanumericMarking of the Front Surface of WafersSEMI M13  Specification for Alphanumeric Markingof Silicon WafersSEMI M17  Guide for a Universal Wafer GridNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 None. 6 Summary of Practice6.1 Front Surface Coordinate System6.1.1 The wafer is positioned with its front surface up.6.1.2 The wafer center is located.6.1.3 A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system iserected.6.1.4 The primary fiducial is located to be in thenegative y-direction.6.1.5 Cartesian or polar coordinates (referenced to thepositive x-axis) are chosen according to the intendedapplication. 6.2 Back Surface Applications6.2.1 The wafer is rotated about the bisector of theprimary fiducial (y-axis) until the back surface is up.6.2.2 This reverses the direction of the x-axis, butotherwise the back surface coordinate system is thesame as the front surface coordinate system.6.3 Three-dimensional Coordinate System6.3.1 Because the zero point on the z-axis isapplication specific, only the direction of the z-axis isdefined and the various possibilities for locating thezero point are considered. 7 Procedure for Establishing WaferCoordinate Systems7.1 Front Surface Coordinate System7.1.1 Position the wafer front surface up.7.1.2 Find the center of the wafer surface.7.1.2.1 For purposes of this document, the periphery ofa wafer is assumed to be the smallest circle enclosingthe wafer, disregarding fiducials and all other edgeanomalies.

R1-1 SEMI E5, in Stream 12  Wafer Mapping, delineates how a coordinate system for reporting position datamay be communicated. The origin of this coordinate system, which is specified by the equipment when generatingthe wafer map, may be the site at any of the four corners of the array or at the array center. In addition, the streamprovides for transmission of an arbitrary number of reference points to relate the map coordinate system to thephysical wafer. The wafer coordinate system may be used to establish the locations of these reference points and ofthe origin of the map coordinate system.R1-2 SEMI M17 defines a polar array of 1000 elements which can be used to identify the locations on a wafer ofextended defects such as slip. This array is consistent with the wafer coordinate system. NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for anyparticular application.

It was developed during theoriginal development of the document. This related information was approved for publication by fullletter ballot on October 16, 2003. R2-1 Element addressing conventions other than thatcovered by this guide are also widely used inengineering. Two of these are illustrated in Figure R2-1with the use of the same truncated array discussed inRelated Information 1.R2-2 First-Quadrant ConventionR2-2.1 Addresses in this convention start at the lowerleft corner of the array and increase to the right andupward in the same way as in the convention coveredby this guide. The lower left corner of the array isdefined by the intersection of the bottom boundary ofthe lowest row and the left boundary of the leftmostcolumn. In the case of tiling, the boundaries are those ofthe lowest elements and the leftmost elements in thearray. The lower left corner may fall outside the usefulportion of the array. The lower left element of the arrayis the element immediately to the right and above thelower left corner of the array.R2-2.2 The First-Quadrant Convention uses a column,row address but does not have a zero row or a zerocolumn.R2-2.3 The addresses of the corners of an array with mcolumns and n rows in the First-Quadrant Conventionare as follows: lower left (Starting Element): (1,1) lower right: (m,1) upper left: (1,n) upper right: (m,n)R2-2.4 The general formulas for obtaining theaddresses of any element (if ,jf ) in the First-QuadrantConvention from the addresses (i,j) in the conventioncovered by this guide are as follows: if = i + integer(m/2) + 1jf = j + integer(n/2) + 1 R2-2.5 These equations also apply to arrays withcolumn or row tiling if n = n or m = m, respectively. Ifthis condition is not met, the displacement of the row orcolumn which defines the array centerline with respectto the boundary of the array must be known totransform the addresses. R2-3 Row, Column (Matrix) ConventionR2-3.1 Addresses in this convention start at the upperleft corner of the array and increase to the right anddownward. The upper left corner of the array is definedby the intersection of the top boundary of the highestrow and the left boundary of the leftmost column. In thecase of tiling, the boundaries are those of the highestelements and the leftmost elements in the array. Theupper left corner may fall outside the useful portion ofthe array. The upper left element of the array is theelement immediately to the right and below the upperleft corner of the array.R2-3.2 The Row, Column (Matrix) Convention uses arow, column address and, like the First-QuadrantConvention, does not have a zero row or a zero column.R2-3.3 The addresses of the corners of an array with mcolumns and n rows in the Row, Column (Matrix)Convention are as follows: upper left (Starting Element): (1,1) upper right: (1,m) lower left: (n,1) lower right: (n,m)R2-3.4 The general formulas for obtaining theaddresses of any element (im,jm) in the Row, Column(Matrix) Convention from the addresses (i,j) in theconvention covered by this guide are as follows:im = integer n/ 2( ) + 1 + jjm = integer m/ 2( ) + 1 + i R2-3.5 These equations also apply to arrays withcolumn or row tiling if n = n or m = m, respectively.

The consumption of InP wafers isincreasing year by year due to the fiber communicationsystems such as LAN, ISDN, and others.A1-2 In order to fabricate these devices, manyrectangular wafers with more than 30 different sizes areindustrially used but most of the sizes are notreasonably determined. From the viewpoint of materialyield as explained below, the standardization ofrectangular InP wafers is useful not only for InP wafermanufacturers, but also for device manufacturers.A1-3 Figure A1-1 shows the effective area (A) as afunction of ratio of longitudinal length (a) and of laterallength (b). It is a fact that the largest area can beobtained when the shape is square. However, it isdifficult to distinguish V-Groove and Dove-Tail Grooveorientations when the shape is square. It is, therefore,necessary to make the shape rectangular in a way thatone can distinguish the orientations. It is however,noted that if the length ratio becomes too large, theeffective area is dramatically decreased as seen inFigure A1-1. For instance, rectangular wafers at the point P have very little area, and most of wafer is cutoff in vain. It is, therefore, very reasonable to select thelength ratio at which the effective area is not largelydecreased. When the length ratio (a/b ratio) is 2, thearea decrease is only 5.7% as seen in Table A1-1 andFigure A1-1. It is also interesting to note that if thelength ratio is determined as 2, each half of therectangular wafer again gives a similar shape with thesame ratio. In fact, this length ratio is used for paperstandardization as A3/A4 or B3/B4. Rectangular wafersare therefore determined SEMI M23.3.A1-4 Since there are already standardized 50 mm and75 mm round wafers, the standardization is made in away that large rectangular wafers can be obtained fromthese standardized wafers by removing 5 mm from theperiphery as seen in Figure A1-2. Removing of 5 mm isdue to EPD measurement specifications in which 5 mmperiphery is excluded from the measurement.A1-5 As explained above, it is highly recommended touse the standardized rectangular wafers because thisstandardization is very important in preventingproliferation of various sizes of rectangular wafers inthe future.
