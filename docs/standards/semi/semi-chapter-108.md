SEMI M53-1103 © SEMI 2003 2 true size of LLSs other than PSL spheres (see Section3.1).2.8 This practice supports requirements listed in SEMIM52.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 LLSs are normally assigned only LSE sizes, notphysical diameters, because the response of an SSIS toan LLS depends on the SSIS optical systemcharacteristics as well as the size, shape, andcomposition of the LLS. The LSE size assigned to aparticular LLS by an SSIS calibrated against PSLspheres may be different from that assigned to the sameLLS by another similarly calibrated SSIS, becausedifferent SSISs have different optical systemcharacteristics.3.2 PSL spheres may have specified characteristics(mean diameter uncertainty, diameter distribution,spread between mean and modal diameter) that differsignificantly from the characteristics of the resultingdeposition due to the transfer function of the depositionsystem. For this reason the practice is limited to the useof PSL sphere depositions that are appropriatelycharacterized. See Related Information 1.3.3 If calibration points occur at, or near, dips in theresponse curve (see Section 5.3.17), the calibrationcurve will not be single valued; therefore dips must beavoided as calibration points if a monotonic calibrationcurve is to be obtained. However, if a completecalibration is desired, the locations and magnitudes ofthe dips must be determined. In this case there may notbe a one-to-one correlation between SSIS response andLSE size; i.e., a particular instrument response maycorrespond to more than one LSE size.1 (See Section5.3.13.1.)3.4 Background Contamination3.4.1 The presence of localized light scatterers withLSE sizes near that of the nominal PSL diameter on thereference wafer may skew the results. This condition 1 See, for example, Locke, B. R., and Donovan, R. P., ParticleSizing Uncertainties in Laser Scanning of Silicon Wafers, Journal ofThe Electrochemical Society, Vol 134, No. 7, 1987, pp. 17631771;or Liu, B. Y. H., Chae, S.-K., and Bae, G.-N., Sizing Accuracy,Counting Efficiency, Lower Detection Limit and Repeatability of aWafer Surface Scanner for Ideal and Real-World Particles, ibid., Vol140, No. 5, 1993, pp. 14031409. may result in a large error or poor equivalent sizingaccuracy.3.4.2 High levels of localized light scatterers on thereference wafer or wafers may overload the SSIS orobscure the peak of the deposited PSL spheredistribution. This condition may also result in a largeerror or poor equivalent sizing accuracy.3.4.3 For these reasons, both the deposition processand calibration procedures must be carried out in aclean environment, and the reference wafers must behandled in such a way as to avoid contaminationbetween deposition process and calibration.3.5 If the surface roughness of the reference wafer orwafers is excessive, the peak of the PSL spheredistribution may be obscured or distorted.3.6 If the SSIS being calibrated is not operating in astable condition, the calibration may not be appropriatefor subsequent use of the system. System stability canbe evaluated by making repeated calibrations, inaccordance with this practice, over suitable timeperiods. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specification for Polished Monocrystal-line Silicon WafersSEMI M20  Specification for Establishing a WaferCoordinate SystemSEMI M50  Test Method for Determining CaptureRate and False Count Rate for Surface ScanningInspection Systems by the Overlay MethodSEMI M52  Guide for Specifying Surface ScanningInspection Systems for Silicon Wafers for the 130-nmTechnology GenerationSEMI MF1241  Standard Terminology of SiliconTechnology4.2 Federal Standard2 Fed Std 209E  Airborne Particulate CleanlinessClasses in Cleanrooms and Clean Zones 2 Standardization Documents Order Desk, Bldg. 4 Section D, 700Robbins Ave., Philadelphia, PA 19111-5094, Attn: NPODS (Thisstandard has been superseded by ISO 14644-1 and may no longer beavailable.)

The deposition property values that must becertified are the peak sphere diameter and the diameterdistribution on the wafer and are determined by boththe PSL sphere source and the deposition process. Thewafer may contain more than one CRM. See RelatedInformation 1.5.3.3 coefficient of variation (CV)  one standarddeviation, , expressed as a percentage of the mean of aGaussian distribution.5.3.4 deposition  an approximately known number ofPSL spheres of known size distribution placed in aknown location on the surface of a reference wafer. 3 International Organization for Standardization, ISO CentralSecretariat, 1, rue de Varemb, Case postale 56, CH-1211 Geneva 20,Switzerland.

Telephone: 212.642.4900; Fax:212.398.0023 Website: www.ansi.org, and in other countries fromISO member organizations. 5.3.5 deposition process  the procedure used to placethe PSL spheres on the reference wafer.5.3.6 dynamic range  of a scanning surfaceinspection system, the signal range covered by aninstrument with one set of measurement conditions.5.3.6.1 Discussion  The useful dynamic range islimited on the small signal side by the backgroundnoise or the inherent resolution of the instrument and onthe large signal side by saturation of the detector and/orthe related electronics. The small signal limit is usuallydefined as the smallest PSL diameter than can bemeasured with a capture rate of at least 95%.5.3.7 false count  a laser-light scattering event thatarises from instrumental causes rather than from anyfeature on or near (in) the wafer surface; also calledfalse positive; compare nuisance count.5.3.7.1 Discussion  False counts would not beexpected to occur at the same point on the wafer surfaceduring multiple inspection scans, and hence they couldbe considered as random noise that could beidentified by examining the results of repeated scans.5.3.8 histogram  a representation of a partitioned(binned) data set as a bar graph in which the widths ofthe bars are proportional to the sizes of the bins of thedata set variable, and the height of each bar isproportional to the frequency of occurrence of values ofthe variable within the bin.5.3.8.1 Discussion  In presenting data for the sizedistribution of LLSs, the data set variable is usually thederived LLS size; in presenting haze data, the data setvariable is usually the haze in ppm. The data set isusually partitioned into bins of equal size on either alinear or logarithmic scale, as appropriate. The bins atthe low and high ends of the data set variable range arecustomarily plotted with the same width as theremainder of the histogram even though they mayrepresent a larger or smaller range of the independentvariable than the rest of the bins.5.3.9 laser-light scattering event  a signal pulse thatexceeds a preset amplitude threshold, generated by theinteraction of a laser beam with an LLS at a wafersurface as sensed by a detector.5.3.9.1 Discussion  The amplitude of the signal intoa single detector, as measured for any combination ofincident beam direction and collection optics, does notby itself convey topographic information, for example,whether the LLS is a pit or a particle. It does not allowthe observer to deduce the size or origin of the scattererwithout other detailed knowledge, such as its index ofrefraction and shape. In a scanning surface inspectionsystem, laser-light scattering events and the background

&lt;!-- Page 3 --&gt;

SEMI M53-1103 © SEMI 2003 4 signal due to haze together comprise the signal due tolight scattering from a wafer surface.5.3.10 latex sphere equivalent (LSE)  the diameter ofa monodisperse polystyrene latex sphere that, underidentical test conditions, produces the same detectedscattering intensity as the LLS under investigation.5.3.10.1 Discussion  If the LLS is assumed to be dueto a particle (or pit), the LSE size (diameter) of theparticle (or pit) is given in units of length followed byLSE; for example, 0.12 m, LSE. This unit varies indifferent ways for different materials from instrumentto instrument because of differences in the opticalsystems and signal processing procedures of differentinstruments. Therefore a particular LLS generally doesnot have the same LSE size when measured on differentmodel instruments or on different channels of the sameinstrument. If elements of the optical system, such asincidence angle, collection solid angle, or polarization,of an SSIS can be varied, the LSE size of a particularLLS will not necessarily be the same for eachconfiguration of the optical system.5.3.11 localized light scatterer (LLS)  an isolatedfeature, such as a particle or a pit, on or in a wafersurface, resulting in increased light scattering intensityrelative to that of the surrounding wafer surface;historically called light point defect because under highintensity optical illumination features of sufficient sizeappear as an isolated point of light.5.3.11.1 Discussion  Localized light scatterers areobserved by automated inspection techniques as laser-light scattering events. Automated inspectiontechniques are quantitative in the sense that scattererswith different scattering intensities can be segregated.However, the amplitude of the scattered light intensity,or laser-light scattering event, as measured by anycombination of incident beam direction and collectionoptics, does not by itself convey topographicalinformation about the LLS; particles and pits cannot bedistinguished solely on the basis of single-channelamplitude data. Also, the observer cannot deduce thesize, shape, or composition of the LLS from single-channel amplitude alone. The presence of LLSs doesnot necessarily decrease the utility of the wafer.5.3.12 missing count  the case in which an LLS failsto produce a laser-light scattering event; also calledfalse negative.5.3.13 multipoint calibration  a procedure forcalibrating the size response of an SSIS using a set ofaccurately sized polystyrene latex spheres, deposited ona wafer surface of the type to be inspected by the SSIS.5.3.13.1 Discussion  The purpose of a calibration isto relate the amount of light captured by an SSIS to the physical size of the light scatterer. The amount of lightscattered from a localized light scatterer (LLS) that iscaptured by the SSIS is a function of both the scatteringcharacteristics of the LLS (including the directionaldependence of the scattering) and the geometry of thecollection optics of the SSIS. For a given wavelengthof incident radiation, regular objects of certain sizesexhibit non-linearities, usually in the form of a dip, sothat the curve of scattering amplitude as a function ofphysical size of the scatterer may not be monotonic.Thus, similar objects with modest variations in physicalsize can scatter the same amount of light. Differentmaterials may exhibit non-linearities at different sizes.Because these effects tend to be less pronounced forirregular particles such as may be found on polishedwafer surfaces, instrument calibration is usually carriedout by avoiding the sizes of spheres that correspond to adip. Sometimes, however, it is desired to fullycharacterize the response of the SSIS to a particulartype of scatterer; in this case, the calibration can becarried out with a set of particles with sizes that coverthe desired range with adequate density to ensure thatany non-linearities in the scattering amplitude-sizecurve are detected.5.3.14 nominal sphere size distribution  the stateddiameter distribution of a suspension of PSL spheres ofa certified diameter used in the calibration of SSISs.5.3.14.1 Discussion  The nominal sphere sizedistribution is usually expressed as the standarddeviation or the coefficient of variation of thedistribution about the certified diameter. Depending onhow the deposition is made, the size distribution of thedeposited spheres may be equal to the distribution inthe original suspension or it may be significantlynarrowed by the deposition process.5.3.15 nuisance count  a signal pulse that arises fromdiscrete or area surface or near-surface features otherthan the localized light scatterers being investigated;compare false count.5.3.15.1 Discussion  The presence of nuisancecounts is dependent on the threshold and gain settingsand may be a function of the optical configuration ofthe SSIS, the orientation of the wafer surface, or both.5.3.16 reference wafer  for calibrating an SSIS inaccordance with this practice, an unpatterned waferwith the same surface films and finish as the wafers tobe examined by the calibrated SSIS and upon whichone or more PSL sphere depositions have been certifiedto specified uncertainties for peak diameter anddiameter distribution.5.3.17 response curve (RC)  the modeled relationbetween measured scattered light intensity (or SSISsignal response) and PSL sphere peak diameters. The

&lt;!-- Page 4 --&gt;

SEMI M53-1103 © SEMI 20035 RC depends on the light source used, is in general non-linear and may contain regions with dips that make theresponse/diameter relationship multi-valued. (SeeSection 3.3).5.3.18 scanning surface inspection system (SSIS)  aninstrument for rapid examination of the entire qualityarea of a wafer to detect the presence of localized lightscatterers or haze or both; also called particle counterand laser surface scanner.5.3.19 threshold  the level set on a scanning surfaceinspection system (SSIS) to discriminate between signalpulses of different size.5.3.19.1 Discussion  Thresholds may be set todiscriminate between true counts and surface orelectrical noise (nuisance or false counts, respectively)or between different sizes of light scatterers. Becauseof spatial non-uniformity of the intensity of thescanning beam and the general use of overlapping scansin an SSIS, a localized light scatterer with equivalentsize near the threshold may generate a signal greaterthan or less than the threshold depending on its locationwith respect to the path of the scanning beam. Theformer is identified as a true count and the latter isidentified as a missing count.5.3.20 true count  a laser-light scattering event thatarises from the localized light scatterers beinginvestigated.5.3.21 unimodal distribution  a distributionrepresented by a histogram with constant bin size thathas a single bell-shaped peak. 6 Summary of Practice6.1 The range of LSE values to be used for calibrationis defined for each dark channel that is to be calibrated.6.2 The number of calibration points required isdefined for each defined range.6.3 Suitable reference wafers with certified PSLdistributions are obtained.6.4 The reference wafers are scanned by the SSISbeing calibrated under machine conditions identicalwith those to be used in examining wafers with thecalibrated SSIS.6.5 The peak diameter of the PSL spheres deposited oneach reference wafer is assigned to the peak value ofthe SSIS signal units.6.6 An RC, the curve of SSIS channel response as afunction of SSIS calibration PSL sphere diameter, isconstructed through the data points obtained. Aseparate calibration curve is developed for eachchannel. 7 Apparatus7.1 Scanning Surface Inspection System  designed todetect, size, and map localized light scatterers (LLSs)on unpatterned semiconductor wafers, that has thefollowing capabilities:7.1.1 Scans the entire fixed quality area of the surfaceof a wafer with a laser beam,7.1.2 Detects localized light scatterers as laser-lightscattering events,7.1.3 Has a user definable sensitivity threshold,7.1.4 Can generate a data set file of the distribution ofthe detected LLSs as a function of reported size (LSE),7.1.5 Can generate a histogram from the data set file,or can output the data set file in a form that can beimported to a spreadsheet or other application programthat can generate the histogram,7.1.6 Is sufficiently repeatable for the intendedapplication, and7.1.7 Handles wafers in a Class 4 or better cleanenvironment as defined in ISO 14644-1. 8 Reference Wafers8.1 Substrates  Use bare semiconductor wafers witha native oxide (or other filmed) surface of the typeintended to be tested with the SSIS to be calibrated assubstrates for the certified depositions of the PSLspheres. This is particularly important because SSISresponse is affected by the optical properties of thesubstrate. Semiconductor wafer surfaces, such asunpatterned polished, epitaxial, or film layers, havedifferent optical properties. The wafers must meet thedimensional requirements of SEMI M1 for theappropriate nominal wafer diameter and must be lasermarked in a manner agreed upon between supplier anduser.8.2 Range of Calibration Diameters  Choose thediameters of the PSL spheres so that the measurementrange for the intended application is covered. Usespheres of size ranging from the largest measurable sizedown to a size with an estimated capture rate less than50%. Do not exceed the dynamic range of the SSISchannel being calibrated. Use sufficient spherediameters to achieve the required 5% PSL sphere sizingaccuracy of the response curve between calibrationpoints using a calibration curve that is produced byfitting the calibration points. In the absence of othercriteria, choose spheres with diameter ratios ofapproximately 1.7.8.2.1 To accomplish the accuracy check (see Section10.4.2), choose an additional set of PSL spheres of size

Ifthe deposition on any reference wafer fails either ofthese criteria, obtain a new reference wafer.NOTE 3: In most cases, the LLS histogram peaks are widerthan the actual deposition diameter distributions. See RelatedInformation 1 for more details.8.4 Data to Accompany Reference Wafers  Acertificate with the following information mustaccompany each reference wafer.8.4.1 For each CRM on the reference wafer provide:8.4.1.1 The deposition peak diameter and theuncertainty in accordance with the requirements of Row3.3 of Table 3 of SEMI M52.8.4.1.2 The maximum possible value of the depositiondiameter distribution full width at half max (FWHM)expressed as a percent of peak diameter.

SEMI M53-1103 © SEMI 20039 RELATED INFORMATION 1DEPOSITION ISSUES NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI M53 and was derived from the work of theAutomated Wafer Surface Inspection Task Force. This related information was approved for publication by fullletter ballot on November 22, 2002.R1-1.1 Both this practice and SEMI M52 introduce thenotion that SSIS calibration should depend on thecharacteristics of PSL sphere depositions as they appearon the reference wafers, rather than the previoustechnique of using the bulk characteristics of the PSLspheres measured prior to being deposited. This changein philosophy has come about for two reasons. First, inmany situations, there is actually some advantage tocreating depositions with different characteristics fromthose of the bulk PSL spheres. For example, thedeposition process may be used to narrow the diameterdistribution thus creating a standard that more closelyapproximates a source of particles of a single knownsize. Secondly, most deposition systems produce atleast minor changes in diameter distributions that aredifficult to eliminate in any case. As a result, thisphilosophical change is being introduced to increase theaccuracy with which SSIS calibration can beaccomplished.R1-1.2 Deposition systems generally consist of anatomizer (which takes the particles from a liquidsuspension to an air droplet mist), followed by a dryer(so that droplets of the source liquid do not reach thewafer), and often include a bipolar charger anddifferential mobility analyzer (or DMA) to size and/orfilter the particles. The changes in characteristics fromsource to deposition are due to at least three distinctcauses. First, virtually all atomizers bias the diameterdistribution slightly in favor of smaller particles. Thisis because the larger particles do not fit in the smallerdroplets and as a result have a smaller probability ofending up in the airborne stream of particles headedtowards the wafer. For narrow source distributions thisis not much of an issue, but for wider sourcedistributions it is. Secondly, the source liquid oftencontains non-volatile solids that may dry onto theparticles, thus slightly changing their diameter.Although this is not as important for larger particlesgreater than 200 nm, it is highly recommended that aPSL suspension with low non-volatiles be used toreduce this source of error. If the DMA is operated in amanner that meets the requirement of this practice for distributions with full width at half maximum (FWHM)of no more than 5% of the peak diameter, then manysource distributions are narrowed by the DMA. This istrue because many PSL sphere sources with diametersless than 200 nm have FWHM values wider than 5% ofpeak value. The 5% FWHM value does not imposesevere difficulties on the DMA design.R1-1.3 In addition to narrowing the depositiondiameter distributions, these standards address relatedaccuracy issues. These are easily understood byconsidering the filtering process of the DMA on thesource distribution as shown in Figure R1-1. The lefthand side of the figure represents a rather broad PSLsource diameter distribution. Notice that it is notsymmetrical, which makes the mean (or average)diameter different from the modal (or peak) diameter.Typically PSL manufacturers have given the meandiameter with their product and industry users haveassigned this value as the diameter for that deposition.Unfortunately depositions are generally made at thepeak diameter. This is because the peak is easily foundby scanning the DMA through the source distributionwhile counting the number of particles passing theDMA. The center section of the figure shows the idealtriangular transfer function of the DMA fixed at somecenter diameter. By adjusting airflows through theDMA, the FWHM can be changed. By adjusting anapplied voltage, the center pass diameter of the transferfunction can be changed. In effect, the depositioncharacteristics are formed through the multiplication ofthe transfer function with the source distribution asindicated on the right hand side of the figure.R1-1.4 Notice that the shape of the depositiondistribution is triangular with bowed in sides, becausethe source distribution is not flat. In effect, this is asafety factor for the 5% FWHM specification. Becausethe source distribution is not necessarily symmetrical,the deposition distribution may not be either; however,the mean and peak deposition diameters will be veryclose because the distribution is relatively narrow.

SEMI M53-1103 © SEMI 2003 10 R1-1.5 The accuracy of the peak diameter, which is specified to have a relative expanded uncertainty at about 95%confidence level as small as possible but not greater than 3% in SEMI M52, is determined by either the accuracywith which the peak source diameter is known (or can be found), or by the accuracy of the DMA sweepvoltage/diameter relationship. Unfortunately many PSL source bottles currently in use do not give the peakdiameter, so this presents a difficulty for the first approach. The second approach, relying on DMA voltageaccuracy, can be checked by using PSL sources that are known to be very narrow (to minimize differences betweensource and deposition peak diameter) with very accurate peak values.PSL Source DiameterDistribution Mean, oraverage,diameterPeak, ormodal,diamete DiameterCounts/DiameterX = Deposition TransferFunction In many depositionsystems, the transferfunction may be scannedthrough the diameterdistribution and set to thepeak diameter.

SEMI M54-0304 © SEMI 2003, 20041 SEMI M54-0304GUIDE FOR SEMI-INSULATING (SI) GaAs MATERIAL PARAMETERS This guide was technically approved by the Global Compound Semiconductor Committee and is the directresponsibility of the European Compound Semiconductor Materials Committee. Current edition approved bythe European Regional Standards Committee on January 9, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.orgFebruary 2004; to be published March 2004. Originally published March 2003. 1 Purpose1.1 Substrates with high electrical resistivity andelectron drift mobility are needed to fabricate highperformance digital and analog microelectronic devicesand circuits. Semi-insulating n-type Gallium Arsenide,henceforth termed SI GaAs, has been establishedworldwide as a preferred substrate material for suchapplications.1.2 The active layers needed for devices are generatedeither by ion implantation or by epitaxy. The quality ofthese layers, and hence the performance, yield andreliability of devices, strongly depends on the bulk andsurface quality of the substrate.1.3 This document provides a basis for specifying thematerial parameters of SI GaAs to support orderingagreements between suppliers and purchasers. 2 Scope2.1 This document defines and describes the electrical,optical, structural, and surface properties of SI GaAsthat are considered technically relevant according to thepresent status of scientific knowledge and materialtechnology.2.2 A specification of the material quality of SI GaAssubstrates includes a number of the parametersdescribed below. Depending on the intendedapplication, a particular subset of properties andrespective parameters will be considered relevant by thepurchaser.2.3 In order to enhance the clarity and applicability ofthe document, the ordering information in Section 6subdivides the material parameters in respect of theirrelative importance, according to general industryperception.2.4 Some material properties and parameters, whileintensively discussed in the technical literature, areinsufficiently established to allow an unambiguousspecification.

It is characterized byfabrication procedures and material properties.4.2 Synthesis of the compound GaAs from theelements gallium (Ga) and arsenic (As) may be done in the crystal growth chamber immediately prior togrowth (in-situ synthesis) in separate equipment, independent of crystalgrowth (ex-situ synthesis)4.3 The growth of SI GaAs single crystals involves oneof the following procedures: Liquid Encapsulated Czochralski (LEC) 1 Available from American Society for Testing and Materials, 100Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-2959,USA. Telephone: 610.832.9585, Fax: 610.832.9555 Website:www.astm.org2 Available from Deutches Institut fr Normung e.V., Beuth VerlagGmbH, Burggrafenstrasse 4-10, D-10787 Berlin, Germany, website:www.din.de  LEC with controlled As vapor pressure (VCZ) Vertical Gradient Freeze (VGF) Vertical Bridgman (VB)4.4 SI GaAs single crystal ingots are thermally treatedafter crystal growth. The annealing procedures aredefined by heating rates, hold temperatures, hold timesand cooling rates. Single step ingot annealing (one holdtime at one temperature) or multi step ingot annealing(several hold times at different temperatures) may beapplied. Wafers may be treated similarly by single stepwafer annealing and multi step wafer annealing.4.5 SI GaAs contains the intrinsic double donor pointdefect EL2, which involves an As atom on a Ga site(As Ga ). At room temperature the first ionization levelEL2 0/EL2 + is approximately at E = 0.69 eV below theconduction band. The concentration \[EL20\] of the neu-tral defect is in the range of 5  1015 to 3  10 16 cm-3.4.6 SI GaAs contains unintentionally incorporatedimpurities acting as donors. It may also containintrinsic donor defects other than EL2. The totalconcentration \[D\] of donors other than EL2 should below for optimal control of ion implantation activationand high electron mobility  (see Section 4.12).4.7 SI GaAs contains impurities acting as acceptors. Itmay also contain intrinsic acceptor defects. Usually thetotal concentration \[A\] of acceptors is adjusted bycontrolled incorporation of carbon (C) in theconcentration range \[C\] 4  1014 cm-3  2  10 16 cm-3 .4.8 SI GaAs contains extrinsic and intrinsic pointdefects that do not participate in the compensationprocess (see Sections 4.10 and 4.11). These defectsmay be isoelectronic centers (e.g. boron (B)incorporated on the Ga site, B Ga ) or extremely deepdonors and acceptors below and above the Fermi level,respectively. They may influence the material quality,for instance by degrading the activation efficiency ofimplanted dopants or by acting as transient carrier trapsand nonradiative recombination centers (NRRC).4.9 SI GaAs generally is nonstoichometric, containingexcess As with a concentration of the order of10 18 cm-3 . The excess As is partly incorporated aslattice antisite defects (AsGa ), see Section 4.5. Otherforms of point defect incorporation (e.g. interstitial As)are likely, but have not been positively identified.Excess As is attracted by dislocations (see Section 4.13)and is concentrated along these, forming decorationprecipitates. Precipitates may also be generated awayfrom dislocations, e.g. in the inner part of dislocationcells (see Section 4.14). They are referred to as matrixprecipitates and are generally smaller than dislocationprecipitates. The concentration and size of precipitates

SEMI M54-0304 © SEMI 2003, 20043 strongly depend on the post growth annealingprocedures (see Section 4.4).4.10 To obtain SI GaAs, complete ionization ofshallow donors and acceptors and partial singleionization of EL2 must be achieved, requiring that\[EL2\] &gt; \[A\] - \[D\] &gt; 0 (1)The Fermi level is then pinned approximately at Ebelow the conduction band.4.11 The resistivity of SI GaAs is given by = (e \[n\] n + e \[p\] p) -1 (2a)where e is the electron charge, \[n\] and \[p\] theconcentration of electrons and holes and n, p therespective mobilities. For material with  &lt; 5  10 8Ωcm and meeting condition (1), the second term maybe neglected, hence = (e \[n\] n ) -1 (2b)The electron concentration is given by\[n\]  \[EL2 0 \] / \[EL2 +\] exp ( -E / kT) (3)where T is temperature, k is Boltzmann's constant andthe concentration \[EL2 +\] of the singly ionized defect isgiven by\[EL2 +\] = \[A\] - \[D\] (4)Equation (3) may be used to normalize resistivity dataM taken at a measurement temperature T M. Thenormalized resistivity S at a standard referencetemperature T S is calculated according toS = M exp ( T) (5)where T = TM - T S (6)and  depends on E at T = 0 K (0.75 eV) and on T S.For TS = 296 K (23°C), one has = 0.0994.4.12 Due to ionized impurity scattering  decreaseswith the concentration \[I\] of ionized centers, given by\[I\] = 2 \[A\] = 2 ( \[EL2 +\] + \[D\]). (7)Relations (3) and (7) imply that  decreases withincreasing resistivity. Relation (7) further implies that,for a given resistivity, low \[D\] is desirable to maximize.4.13 SI GaAs ingots usually contain dislocationsgenerated by thermal stress during crystal growth andpostgrowth annealing. The dislocation density (DD),although a volume property, is evaluated by measuringthe area density of dislocations threading a substratesurface. Structural etching with molten KOH generatescharacteristically shaped etch pits at the threading points. Hence the DD is characterized by quoting theetch pit density (EPD).4.14 Depending on the growth method and the ingotdiameter, the EPD may vary from essentially zero up to2  10 5 cm-2 . The lateral variation of the EPD generallyforms a pattern of globular dislocation-free cellssurrounded by high DD walls. The cell dimensionsare on the order of 100 m  for LEC grown materialand about an order of magnitude larger for VGF grownmaterial.4.15 State-of-the-art SI GaAs substrates do not containpolycrystalline structure or twins.4.16 The intensity of band-to-band and shallowdonor/acceptor-related radiative carrier recombinationluminescence depends on the minority carrier lifetime,which in turn is related to the distribution of NRRCs.These centers are generally believed to be intrinsicdefects and appear to have a minor influence on theelectrical properties.4.17 The quality of the front surface of the wafer ismainly determined by global and local flatness (notaddressed here in detail), surface contamination, lightpoint defect (LPD)3 density and micro-roughness(haze). Other surface irregularities to be considered ina supplier-purchaser agreement include stain, scratches,pits, orange peel and dimples as defined in SEMI M10.4.18 The thickness and structure of the oxide on thesurface of SI GaAs wafers to be used for epitaxy maybe prepared to allow layer deposition without chemicalpre-cleaning by the user. Generally this materialproperty is guaranteed for a certain time interval only. 5 Parameter Verification5.1 The material specification of SI GaAs according toSection 6 requires agreements on specificationverification. Existing standard test methods aresuggested and referenced in Section 3.5.2 If a standard test method is not available,alternative verification methods are recommended anddescribed in order to identify practicablecharacterization procedures that are consonant withindustry practice and cost considerations.5.3 Some characterization methods, while intensivelyused for exploratory material investigations, yieldqualitative information only and are, therefore,inadequate for a specification verification. They arenevertheless included, with appropriate comment, toensure comprehensiveness of this guideline and tofacilitate respective supplier-purchaser agreements. 3 For silicon wafers, and sometimes for GaAs, the acronym LLS(localized light scatterer) is used.

SEMI M54-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 4 5.4 The concentration of C incorporated on the Aslattice site, \[CAS\], is measured using the localvibrational mode (LVM) absorption with FourierTransform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Presentlytwo standard test methods (SEMI M30 and DIN 50449-1) are available. SEMI M30 is valid for measurementat room temperature and \[C\] &gt; 10 15 cm-3 . It requiresindividual instrument calibration with a set ofsecondary reference samples. DIN 50449-1 definesstandardized FTIR measurement parameters andcalibration factors for measurement at roomtemperature and at 77K, the latter having a detectionlimit \[C\] ≥ 10 13 cm3. For practically relevantconcentrations (see Section 4.7) there is no evidence forcarbon incorporation other than on the As lattice site.Hence the calibration factors quoted in SEMI M30 andDIN 50449-1 imply that \[C\] = \[CAs \]. The resultsobtained when using the two standard test methodspresently are conflicting, hence a harmonizing activityis considered necessary.5.5 The electrical resistivity  can be evaluated withcontacting and noncontacting techniques. Thecontacting van der Pauw measurement is performedaccording to ASTM F76 or SEMI M39, the latterspecifically addressing the measurement of SI GaAs.The noncontacting measurement using a capacitiveprobe is performed according to DIN 50448. Thistechnique enables measurement of lateral variations of. Resistivity will be quoted for an agreed standardtemperature; 296K (23°C) is recommended.Measurements done at a different temperature must benormalized to the standard temperature as described inSection 4.11. The difference between the standard andmeasurement temperatures must not exceed 5°C.5.6 The electron mobility  is measured using the Halleffect and a van der Pauw structure. The evaluation isperformed according to ASTM F76 or SEMI M39.5.7 The etch pit density (EPD) of LEC grown SI GaAsis evaluated according to ASTM F1404 or DIN 50454-1. The documents describe the etching procedure anddefine test location plans linked to the crystallographicaxes.5.8 The EPD of VGF, VCZ and VB grown SI GaAs is10 4 cm-2 or below. The evaluation is performedaccording to DIN 50454-1 or SEMI M36. The testlocations are defined by a fixed grid (SEMI M36) or byan adaptable grid generated by a standardizedprocedure (DIN 50454-1). Guidelines are given toassess the lateral variation of EPD.5.9 The light point defect (LPD) density is a measurefor the density of surface irregularities that are above acertain size limit (usually 300 nm in diameter). Theseirregularities may be foreign material deposited on the wafer surface (particles) or so-called crystal originatingpits (COPs) caused by volume materialinhomogeneities generated during the growth and/orannealing procedures and can be revealed byapplication of a light scattering technique. Dependingon the mechano-chemical polishing processes and thelight scattering technique employed, COPs may or maynot be observed. At present no standard test method forLPD evaluation is available. Therefore, a supplier-purchaser agreement on e.g. the used measurementsystem, size restriction procedure, edge exclusion,inclusion or exclusion of COPs is necessary. Toexclude an influence of different measuring systems thesize of LPDs should be given in units of diameter, notof a scattering cross section.5.10 The concentration of the neutral double donor\[EL2 0\] is measured using the optical absorption at about1 m. An absolute determination is impossible becauseneither a generally accepted calibration standard nor astandardized test procedure is presently available 4.Hence a supplier-purchaser agreement is necessary toensure reproducibility. The relative lateral variation of\[EL2 0\] can be quantitatively assessed with highprecision. The evaluation of \[EL2 +\] using opticalabsorption is presently considered unreliable.5.11 The total concentration of impurities acting asdonors is measured by Spark Source or Glow DischargeMass Spectroscopy (SSMS, GDMS). The dominantcontributions are Si, S, O, and Te. The analyticalprocedure is time-consuming and costly, hence it isgenerally confined to e.g. biannual controlmeasurements of the supplier to ensure that rawmaterial supply, synthesis and crystal growthprocedures are stable. By virtue of the compensationprocess (see Section 4.11) the donor concentration \[D\],including intrinsic defects, is implicitly controlled byspecifying \[C\], \[EL2\] and .5.12 The total concentration of impurities acting asacceptors is measured by SSMS or GDMS. Theanalytical procedure is time-consuming and costly,hence is generally confined to regular controlmeasurements of the supplier to ensure that rawmaterial supply and the synthesis and crystal growthprocedures are stable. The dominant contributionusually is C, intentionally doped to control . Hence itis generally sufficient to verify that the totalconcentration of acceptor impurities other than C issmall compared to \[C\].5.13 The concentration of B is measured using thelocal vibrational mode (LVM) absorption according toDIN 50449-2. Established, but non-standardized 4 A DIN standard test method to measure \[EL2\] is in preparation andis scheduled for publication in 2002.

SEMI M54-0304 © SEMI 2003, 20045 methods include GDMS, SSMS, Secondary Ion MassSpectroscopy (SIMS) and atomic absorptionspectroscopy (AAS).5.14 Surface contaminants are identified and quantifiedwith Time-of-Flight-SIMS (TOF-SIMS) and TotalReflection X-Ray Fluorescence (TXRF). The lattertechnique is difficult to apply for impurities with atomicweight below those of the matrix elements Ga and As.5.15 Deposition of high quality epitaxial layers withoutchemical pre-cleaning depends on the surface oxidestructure of the substrate, as prepared by the supplier, aswell as the thermal oxide desorption and the epitaxialdeposition procedures of the purchaser. Hence anindividual supplier-purchaser specific evaluation isnecessary. Test epitaxy followed by layer qualityassessment is recommended.5.16 The lateral substrate homogeneity is assessed byautomated analytic instrumentation elaborated togenerate topographic images of important materialparameters, including electrical resistivity, EL2concentration, EPD and minority carrier lifetime.Macroscopic (e.g. radial) variations as well asmesoscopic fluctuations (generally correlated to thecellular dislocation structure) may be assessed. Suchtopographic analysis is provided, respectively, bycontactless capacitive resistivity mapping (see DIN50448), EL2 absorption topography (see footnote 3),specular light reflection topography andphotoluminescence topography. The first threetopography techniques provide quantitative data.Photoluminescence topography gives qualitativehomogeneity information only, because theinterrelations between the luminescence intensity andthe various radiative and nonradiative recombinationprocesses are only partially understood. The details ofthe topographic measurements, i.e. lateral resolutionand edge exclusion, must be defined by individualsupplier-purchaser agreement.5.17 As precipitates, other inclusions and voids arevisualized with light scattering tomography (LST). Atpresent it is not possible to differentiate between thesescattering centers and to obtain quantitative informationconcerning their concentration and size. Hence LSTimages provide a qualitative information only.5.18 Micro-roughness, also referred to as haze, isindicated by a diffuse reflection of collimated, laterallyextended high intensity illumination from the wafersurface. Localized haze and haze observed onparticular wafers of a batch indicate potentiallydisadvantageous variations of surface quality. Theagreement should specify the conditions of observation(e.g. illumination intensity). 5.19 Surface irregularities (stain, scratches, pits, orangepeel, dimples) are identified by high intensityillumination or by standard and phase sensitive(Nomarski) microscopy. Individual agreement isrecommended concerning the permitted surface densityof these defects. 6 Ordering Information6.1 The material properties of SI GaAs substrates, asdescribed in Section 4, are addressed in the orderingagreement using the tables given below. Thesubdivisions into important, optional and otherspecifications are suggested only, i.e. supplier andpurchaser may agree on an individual choice, takinginto account the respective application as well as costconsiderations.6.2 In addition to specifying individual materialproperties as listed below, the purchase order mayspecify the fabrication procedures according to Sections4.2 and 4.3.6.3 Substrates are usually delivered in batches. Thebatch homogeneity is defined in the purchasingagreement by variation ranges of specified parameters.The ordering agreement shall also state whether batchesmust originate from one ingot or may be assembledfrom several specified or unspecified ingots. In eithercase the supplier guarantees compliance with thespecified batch homogeneity by control of fabricationtechnology and appropriate test sample evaluations.6.4 Table 1 lists the parameters that are consideredimportant to specify the material quality of SI GaAssubstrates. The level of importance may be adjustedindividually by taking into account the intended use forimplantation or epitaxy. The quoted absolute valuessuggest a customary material specification, to beadopted unless individual considerations warrant otherchoices.6.5 Table 2 lists optional parameters that are importantfor specific applications only, hence may or may not beconsidered relevant for a particular supplier/purchaseragreement. For most of these parameters, standard testmethods at present do not exist.6.6 Table 3 lists other parameters which in generalneed not be specified, but are addressed for clarificationand to provide a basis for agreement in the event that apurchaser desires to include such parameters into apurchasing specification. 7 Related Documents7.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specification for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon Wafers

Bow is a bulk property of the test specimen,not a property of an exposed surface. Generally, bow is determined with a test specimen in a free, unclampedcondition. Units of bow are generally micrometers.4.1.2 crystallite  any part of the wafer, having an arbitrary orientation of its crystallographic axis in respect to themonocrystalline part of the wafer.4.1.3 dopant  a chemical element, usually from the third or fifth column of the periodic table for the case of IV-IV compounds, incorporated in trace amounts in a semiconductor crystal to establish its conductivity type andresistivity.4.1.4 edge contouring  on wafers whose edges have been shaped by mechanical and/or chemical means, adescription of the profile of the boundary of the wafer joining the front and back sides.4.1.5 edge exclusion  the width X of a narrow band of wafer surface, located just inside the wafer edge, overwhich the values of the specified parameter do not apply. See definition of fixed quality area below.4.1.6 fixed quality area (FQA)  The central area of a wafer surface, defined by a nominal edge exclusion, X, overwhich the specified values of a parameter apply.4.1.6.1 Discussion  The boundary of the FQA is at all points the distance X away from the periphery of a wafer ofnominal dimensions. (See Figure 1.) The size of the FQA is independent of wafer diameter and flat lengthtolerances.4.1.7 lot  for the purpose of this document, (a) all of the wafers of nominally identical size and characteristicscontained in a single shipment, or (b) subdivisions of large shipments consisting of wafers as above which have beenidentified by the supplier as constituting a lot.4.1.8 micropipe  small hollow tube approximately parallel to the crystallographic c-axis and extending throughthe whole crystal.4.1.9 orthogonal misorientation  in &#123;0001&#125; wafers cut intentionally off-orientation, the angle between theprojection of the vector normal to the wafer surface onto the &#123;0001&#125; plane and the projection on that plane of thespecified direction of tilt in the &#123;0001&#125; plane. (See Figure 2.)4.1.10 planar defect  small cavity in a SiC bulk crystal with large width-to-height ratio roughly parallel to the&#123;0001&#125; lattice plane. The lateral boundaries are parallel to crystallographic directions. Often one or moremicropipes are connected to a planar defect.4.1.11 polytype  one possible crystallographic modification of a substance which shows the phenomenon ofpolytypism. All polytypes of a substance have the same lattice layers with nearly the same lattice constant incommon. However the stacking sequence of these layers differs between different polytypes. Most commonlypolytypes are named after a suggestion of Ramsdell6: A symbol like 6H gives the number of layers in one periodicstacking sequence (2, 3, 4, ... ) and the symmetry of the resulting crystal (H = hexagonal, R = rhombohedral). Themost common polytypes of SiC are 6H, 4H, 15R.4.1.12 surface orientation  the tilt angle between the crystallographic c-axis and the wafer surface normal. (SeeFigure 2.)4.1.13 total indicator reading (TIR)  the smallest perpendicular distance between two planes, both parallel withthe reference plane, which encloses all points on the front surface of a wafer within the FQA, the site, or the subsite,depending on which is specified. 6 L.

SEMI M55-0705 © SEMI 2003, 2004 4 4.1.14 total thickness variation (TTV)  the difference between the maximum and minimum thickness values of awafer encountered during a scan pattern or a series of point requirements. TTV is generally expressed inmicrometers.4.1.15 warp  of a semiconductor slice or wafer, the difference between the maximum and minimum distance ofthe median surface of the wafer from a reference plane, encountered during a scan pattern. Warp is a bulk propertyof the test specimen, not a property of an exposed surface. Warp is generally expressed in micrometers. 5 Ordering Information5.1 Purchase orders for silicon carbide wafers furnished to this specification shall include the following items:5.1.1 Polytype,5.1.2 Nominal diameter (see applicable SEMI Standard for polished SiC wafers),5.1.3 Thickness (see applicable SEMI Standard for polished SiC wafers),5.1.4 Dopant (see applicable SEMI Standard for polished SiC wafers),5.1.5 Resistivity or Carrier Concentration (see applicable SEMI Standard for polished SiC wafers),5.1.6 Total Thickness Variation (see applicable SEMI Standard for polished SiC wafers),5.1.7 Surface orientation (see applicable SEMI Standard for polished SiC wafers),5.1.8 Polarity of Surfaces (see applicable SEMI Standard for polished SiC wafers),5.1.9 Lot Acceptance Procedures (see 7),5.1.10 Certification (see 11), and5.1.11 Packing and Marking (see 12). 6 Dimensions and Permissible Variations6.1 The material shall conform to the dimensions and dimensional tolerances as specified in the applicable polishedsilicon carbide wafer standard.6.2 The material shall conform to the crystallographic orientation details as specified in the applicable polishedsilicon carbide wafer standard.6.3 If edge contoured wafers are specified on the purchase order, the profile shall conform to the followingrequirements at all points on the wafer periphery.6.3.1 When the wafer is aligned with the SEMI Wafer Edge Profile Template (see Figure 3) so that the x-axis of thetemplate is coincident with the wafer surface and the y-axis of the template forms a tangent with the outermost radialportion of the contour, the wafer edge profile must be contained within the clear region of the template.

SEMI M55-0705 © SEMI 2003, 20045 8 Test MethodsNOTE 3: SiC wafers are extremely fragile. While the mechanical dimensions of a wafer can be measured by use of tools such asmicrometer calipers and other conventional techniques, the wafer may be damaged physically in ways that are not immediatelyevident. Special care must therefore be used in the selection and execution of measurement methods.8.1 Test Plan for Crystal Quality within One Crystal  Determine by a method agreed upon between the supplierand purchaser.NOTE 4: The assessment of the crystal quality is a problem of great practical impact as it can be very time consuming and costlyor even impossible in the case of destructive test methods to test every wafer. However in general crystal quality does not changeabruptly in a crystal. The evaluation of a subset of all wafers from a given crystal will give sufficient information about thequality of the whole crystal.8.2 Polytype  For nominally undoped material (n &lt; 1017/cm3) determine by visual inspection at 77K (liquidnitrogen) under UV excitation. For doped material (n &gt; 1017/cm3) determine by visual inspection of the colors of thedoped material under diffuse lighting conditions.8.3 Diameter  Determine by ASTM Test Method F2074.8.4 Thickness, Center Point  Determine by ASTM Test Method F533.8.5 Flat Length  Determine by ASTM Test Method F671.8.6 Bow and Warp  Determine bow in accordance with ASTM Test Method F534 and warp in accordance withASTM Test Method F657.NOTE 5: ASTM has standardized two methods for measuring warp. ASTM Test Method F1390 is an automated, non-contactmethod which provides for correction of the wafer deflection due to gravitational effects. The scan pattern covers the entire fixedquality area. ASTM Test Method F657 is a manual, non-contact method which has a continuous, prescribed scan pattern whichcovers only a portion of the wafer surface. There is no provision for correction of the wafer deflection due to gravitationaleffects. As noted in Appendix 2, different reference planes are used for the two methods. Because Test Method F657 employs aback surface reference plane, the measured warp may include contributions from thickness variation of the wafer. Test MethodF1390 employs a median surface reference plane and is not susceptible to interferences from thickness variations. In general,Test Method F1390 is preferred, especially for wafers 150 mm in diameter and larger.8.7 Total Thickness Variation  Determine by ASTM Test Method F657.NOTE 6: ASTM Test Method F533, DIN 50441/1 and JIS H 0611 are all 5 point methods, while Test Method F657 involves acontinuous scan pattern over a portion of the wafer surface and Test Method F1530 involves an automated continuous scanpattern over the entire wafer surface. JIS H 0611 differs from ASTM Test Method F533 and DIN 50441/1, in that themeasurements in JIS H 0611 are taken at the center and at 5 mm from the edge on diameters parallel and perpendicular to theprimary orientation flat or notch bisector, while the measurements in ASTM Test Method F533 and DIN 50441/1 are taken at thecenter and at the same radial distance (Rnominal -6 mm) on diameters 30° and 120° counterclockwise from the bisector to theprimary orientation flat or notch (with the wafer facing front surface up).8.8 Surface Polarity  Determine by a method agreed upon between the supplier and the purchaser.NOTE 7: There are several destructive and non-destructive methods. Most common examples are a chemical etch of the surface(destructive), by comparing the differently reacting carbon and silicon faces, and wet oxidation (non-destructive) by comparingthe different growth rates on both surfaces by measuring the oxide layer thickness.8.9 Flat Orientation  Determine by ASTM Test Methods F847.8.10 Surface Orientation  Determine by ASTM Test Methods F26.8.11 Orthogonal Misorientation  Determined by a method agreed upon between the supplier and purchaser.8.12 Surface Defects and Contamination8.12.1 Visually Observable Surface Defects  Determined by ASTM Practice F523 or a method agreed uponbetween the supplier and purchaser.8.13 Edge Contour  Determine by ASTM Test Method F928.8.14 Resistivity  For conductive wafers determine by ASTM Test Method F43 or ASTM Test Method F673. Forhigh-resistivity or semi-insulating material determine by DIN 50448.

&lt;!-- Page 22 --&gt;

SEMI M55-0705 © SEMI 2003, 2004 6 NOTE 8: ASTM F43 is a four-point-probe technique whereas ASTM F673 is an inductive non-contact method. These methodsare limited to some 102 Ωcm. DIN 50448 is a non-contact capacitive method suitable for the range 105 to 1011 Ωcm.8.15 Etch Pit Density  Determine by ASTM Test Method F1404 or a method agreed upon between the supplierand purchaser.NOTE 9: ASTM test method F1404 was intended only for use with gallium arsenide. Nevertheless it should serve as a guidelinefor determining the etch pit density of silicon carbide.8.16 Micropipe Density  Determine by a method agreed upon between the supplier and purchaser.8.17 Crystal Perfection  Determine by a method agreed upon between the supplier and purchaser. 9 Flat System9.1 For silicon carbide wafers with the surface normal close to the crystallographic c-axis (small tilt angles, seeFigure 2) one primary orientation flat and one secondary flat is specified. The primary flat always has a greater flatlength compared to the secondary flat. (See Figure 6.)9.2 The angle between primary and secondary flat is always 90° (see Figure 5). For the tolerance see theappropriate silicon carbide wafer standard.9.3 The polarity of the wafer surfaces is indicated by the relative flat positions of primary and secondary flat asshown in Figure 5.9.4 The edge of the primary flat is always parallel to the \[11-20\] direction (or, which is the same, parallel to the (1-100) lattice plane.) For tolerances see the appropriate silicon carbide wafer standard.9.5 For the exact dimensions of the flat length and the tolerances see the appropriate silicon carbide wafer standard. 10 Standard Defect Limits10.1 Minimal conditions or dimensions for surface defects are stated below. These limits shall be used fordetermining wafer acceptability; anomalies smaller than these limits shall not be considered as defects.10.2 Surface Defects10.2.1 edge chip and indent  Any edge anomaly including saw exit marks conforming to the definition (ASTMF154) and greater than 0.25 mm in radial depth and peripheral length. (See Figure 7.)10.2.2 orange peel  Any visually detectable roughened surface conforming to the definition (ASTM F154) andobservable under diffused illumination. Pits with a spacing of less than 2 mm are treated as orange peel.10.2.3 particles  Distinct particles resting on the surface which are revealed under collimated intense light asbright points.10.2.4 pit  Any individually distinguishable depression in the surface with a length-to-width ratio smaller than5:1, visible when viewed under intense illumination.NOTE 10: This definition is different from ASTM F154 in so far as the slope of the sides of the depression are not taken intoaccount.10.2.5 scratch  Any anomaly conforming to the definition (ASTM F154) and having a length-to-width ratiogreater than 5:1 and visible under intense illumination.10.3 Bulk Defects10.3.1 crack  Any anomaly conforming to the definition (ASTM F154) and greater than 0.25 mm in total length.10.3.2 crystallite  Any anomaly conforming to the definition (see 3) and having a misorientation of more than1° to the main (monocrystalline) part of the wafer and having a maximum width larger than 0.20 mm.10.3.3 micropipe  Any anomaly conforming to the definition (see 3) and visible by microscopic inspection intransmission mode at a magnification of 100 or after etching in molten KOH, which will reveal micropipes ashexagonal structures.

&lt;!-- Page 23 --&gt;

SEMI M55-0705 © SEMI 2003, 20047 NOTE 11: For microscopic inspection the use of crossed polarisers is recommended. However not all micropipes will be visibleunder crossed polarisers.10.3.4 planar defect  Any anomaly conforming to the definition (see 3) having a maximum width larger than0.20 mm. 11 Certification11.1 Upon request of the purchaser in the contract or order, a manufacturers or suppliers certification that thematerial was manufactured and tested in accordance with this specification together, with a report of the test results,shall be furnished at the time of shipment.11.2 In the interest of controlling inspection costs, the supplier and the purchaser may agree that the material shallbe certified as capable of meeting certain requirements. In this context, capable of meeting shall signify that thesupplier is not required to perform the appropriate tests in 8. However, if the purchaser performs the test and thematerial fails to meet the requirement, the material may be subject to rejection. 12 Packing and Marking12.1 The wafers supplied under these specifications shall be identified by an individual laser marking consisting ofthe supplier assigned lot-number on the backside of each wafer. The laser marking consists of one line of charactersparallel to the primary flat and must be readable with unaided eye. The top of the characters is directed towards thewafer center. All characters must be completely located within the marking window given in Figure 8. For detailssee the appropriate polished Silicon Carbide Wafer Standard.NOTE 12: SEMI M12 is a standard for the front side marking of silicon wafers and, as a whole, is not applicable to SiliconCarbide wafers. It is referenced, because some elements of SEMI M12 (see the appropriate polished Silicon Carbide WaferStandard) shall also be used for Silicon Carbide.12.2 Special packing and marking requirements shall be subject to agreement between the supplier and thepurchaser. Otherwise, all wafers shall be handled, inspected, and packed in such a manner as to avoid chipping,scratches, and contamination in accordance with the best industry practices to provide ample protection againstdamage during shipment.12.3 The wafers shall be identified by appropriately labeling the outside of each box or other container and eachsubdivision thereof in which it may reasonably be expected that the wafers will be stored prior to further processing.Identification shall include as a minimum the nominal diameter, conductive dopant, orientation, resistivity range,and lot number.12.4 The lot number, either (1) assigned by the original manufacturer of the wafers, or (2) assigned subsequent toslice manufacture but providing reference to the original lot number, shall provide easy access to informationconcerning the fabrication history of the particular wafers in that lot. Such information shall be retained on file atthe manufacturer's facility for at least 10 years or as negotiated between vendor and user after that particular lot hasbeen accepted by the purchaser. 13 Related Documents13.1 ASTM StandardsASTM F76  Test Methods for Measuring Resistivity and Hall Coefficient and Determining Hall Mobility inSingle-Crystal SemiconductorsASTM F1241  Terminology of Silicon Technology13.2 DIN-StandardsDIN 50433/1  Determination of the Orientation of Single Crystals by Means of X-Ray DiffractionDIN 50433/3  Determination of the Orientation of Single Crystals by Means of Laue Back ScatteringDIN 50441/2  Measurement of the Geometric Dimensions of Semiconductor Wafers: Testing of Edge ProfileDIN 50441/4  Measurement of the Geometrical Dimensions of Semiconductor Wafers: Slice Diameter, DiameterVariation, Flat Diameter, Flat Length, Flat Depth

SEMI M56-1103 © SEMI 20031 SEMI M56-1103PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FORMETROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITYAND BIAS This practice was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on September 3, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.orgOctober 2003; to be published November 2003.1 Purpose1.1 In silicon manufacturing product disposition istypically contingent on metrology equipment output.For example, a piece of work may be shipped,scrapped, or reworked based on information from oneor more measured output characteristics. A cost modelprovides a mechanism for estimating the costsassociated with operating metrology equipment undercertain sets of assumptions and conditions.1.2 This practice provides a standard methodology formetrology equipment suppliers and users to determinethe cost due to misclassification of product because ofmeasurement variability and bias during testing of theproduct for conformance to a specification.1.3 This practice is intended to be useful for pre-purchase evaluation of measurement equipment withdifferent P/T (Precision/Tolerance) ratios. It is alsointended to be useful when comparing the operation ofa single measurement instrument in differentthroughput modes where P/T ratio changes with thethroughput mode utilized or other equipment setupfactors. This practice can help users select the optimumcost solution based on their specific process capabilityand requirements.1.4 Neither traditional cost elements (e.g., equipment,maintenance, operational, and staffing cost) nor productcost data are included in the practice; it is intended thateach user should utilize appropriate data based on theapplicable business model for the facility. 2 Scope2.1 This practice covers a methodology to determinethe costs associated with misclassification of productdue to variability and bias of measurement equipment.These costs are associated with failing product thatconforms with specifications and passing product thatdoes not conform with specifications.2.2 This practice can be applied to make relative costcomparisons between two or more measurement gaugesoperating under conditions specified by the user. Theseconditions may include any aspects of the measurementsystem affecting the measurement results directly or indirectly (e.g., ambient conditions, throughput, recipe).This practice can also be used to compare the relativecosts of a single instrument under different operatingconditions.2.2.1 A measurement gauge is defined by a specificrealization of systems and subsystems required to makemeasurements. Gauges that differ in at least one systemor subsystem may be considered different for thepurpose of comparison.2.3 This practice can be applied to any metrologyequipment or to the metrology portion of anyequipment that includes metrology.2.4 This practice covers the case in which themetrology equipment is used to make binary decisionsabout the item being measured, that is, only twooutcomes are possible (e.g., pass/fail, go/no-go,ship/scrap). Models for decisions with more than twooutcomes, such as the binning of data, are beyond thescope of this practice.2.5 To apply the formulae in this practice, the usermust estimate either the probability density function(PDF) or cumulative distribution function (CDF) of theprocess characteristic or characteristics of interest. Thedistributions can be based on a theoretical model or onempirical information obtained from manufacturingdata.2.6 To apply the formulae in this practice, the usermust be able to estimate all biases and variancesassociated with the equipment being compared underthe specified operating conditions and with respect tothe process characteristic(s) of interest. These valuescan be obtained from a measurement system capabilityanalysis (see SEMI E89).2.7 To apply the methodology of this practice, the usermust estimate the costs of classification andmisclassification due to decisions made as a result ofmeasurements. Estimates of such costs are obtainedfrom the business model used to describe themanufacturing process in which the measurements areperformed. Consequently, different users may arrive atdifferent estimates of costs because their computationsmay contain different elements.

SEMI M56-1103 © SEMI 2003 2 2.8 The output of this practice is the cost componentdue to measurement variability and bias for eachprocess characteristic and metrology system evaluated.2.9 This practice does not consider costs associatedwith other components of uncertainty outside ofmeasurement variability and bias.2.10 Although it is focused on the issue of misclassifi-cation, the practice may be extended to include costsassociated with correct classification by the metrologyequipment.2.11 This practice was developed to evaluatemetrology equipment used in silicon wafermanufacturing, but it may be extended to other types ofmetrology equipment by making suitable modifications.NOTICE: This practice does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior touse. 3 Limitations3.1 Application of this practice requires that allmeasurement variances and biases, processcharacteristic distributions, and costs of classificationand misclassification be accurately characterized. Ifthis is not done, the resulting calculation may be inerror.3.2 Application of this practice also requires thatmeasurement variances and biases be constant over themeasurement range interval of interest. If this is not thecase, the resulting calculation may be in error.3.3 This practice considers only the case of twoconvolved distributions, process characteristicvariability and measurement variability; considerationof additional distributions (such as would be required ifthe measurement bias or variance were assumed to be afunction of the measured value) is beyond the scope ofthis practice.3.4 Extension of the model to the cases of decisionsbased on (1) measurements on multiple gauges, (2)multiple inspections with the same gauge or (3) onmultiple characteristics is outside the scope of thispractice, but information on such extensions is providedin Related Information 1 for the convenience of theuser.3.5 This model should not be confused with a cost-of-ownership model, such as that developed in SEMI E35,which explicitly includes information on the costelements involved. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E35  Cost of Ownership for SemiconductorManufacturing Equipment MetricsSEMI E89  Guide for Measurement SystemCapability AnalysisSEMI M1  Specifications for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI M27  Practice for Determining the Precisionover Tolerance Ratio of Test Equipment4.2 ISO Document1 International Vocabulary of Basic and General Termsin Metrology, Second Edition \[VIM\]NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 General terminology related to metrology isdefined in VIM.5.2 Terminology relating to measurement systemcapability analysis is defined in SEMI E89.5.3 Terminology related to silicon wafer technology isdefined in SEMI M1.5.4 Other Definitions5.4.1 alpha error  the error that occurs when aconforming item is incorrectly reported as non-conforming.

It was derived from task force deliberationsduring the development of the document. This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballotprocedures on September 3, 2003. R1-1 IntroductionR1-1.1 In general, when a single characteristic on anitem is measured once on a single gauge and 100%sampling is employed, the model will take the formdescribed in this practice.R1-1.2 If the situation is more complex, the nature ofthe model will be different. Factors that can affect thenature of the model include the following: number of items examined (lot acceptancesampling vs. 100% sampling), number of times an item is inspected (single vs.multiple), effect of the inspection process on the item(destructive vs. non-destructive), number of item characteristics examined for asingle decision (one vs. many), and cost functions associated with the businessdecisions (fixed vs. variable).R1-1.3 In addition, it is possible to have more than oneset of cost functions for each type of item that isinspected by the metrology system. Because much ofthis is context specific, it would be impossible to coverall possible models. Other extensions to the modelinclude relaxation of the assumption of constantvariance, the introduction of variability in the bias, andthe use of guard banding. The foundation of all theseextensions, however, is the use of and. R1-2 Extension to Multiple GaugesR1-2.1 To extend the model to multiple gauges, onemust make the additional assumption that all measuringgauges are measuring the same characteristic.R1-2.1.1 In addition, define a conforming item as onethat all gauges show the measured characteristic to bein specification.R1-2.1.2 A non-conforming item is taken to be one inwhich at least one gauge shows the measuredcharacteristic to be outside of specification.R1-2.2 It is then possible to define a set of anderror rates for each gauge. Let1,2, ,n be the values and1,2, ,n be the values associated withthe n different gauges.R1-2.3 The overall value,T, is calculated from theequation: T = n ii1)1( where: ,d)(=USLxxf and f (x) = PDF of the characteristic being measured.NOTE 1: This equation is based on the probability P that theitem is conforming but that one or more gauges give aconforming result:T = P\[Item is conforming, ≥1 gauges show nonconforming\]= P\[Item is conforming\] P\[Item is conforming, All gauges show conforming\]R1-2.4 The overall value,T, is calculated from theequation: T = = n ii1. NOTE 2: This equation is based on the probability P that theitem is nonconforming but that all gauges give a conformingresult:T = P\[ Item is nonconforming, All gauges show pass\] R1-3 Extension to Multiple Inspections withthe Same Metrology SystemR1-3.1 Multiple inspection with the same metrologysystem is a special case of inspection with multiplegauges. If the same measurement system is used tomeasure the item characteristic repeatedly, one merelyletsi = andi = for all i, as the and error rateswill not change for the same gauge. R1-4 Extension to Decisions Based onMultiple CharacteristicsR1-4.1 It is also possible to develop a model where adecision is based on more than one characteristic. Aswith the case of multiple gauges, several assumptionsmust be made.

It was derived from task forcedeliberations during the development of the document. This related information was approved for publication byfull letter ballot procedures on September 3, 2003.R3-1 The model in this practice is used to assignprobabilities (risks) to specification-related events. Ingeneral, there are two probabilities that are of interest.The first is the probability of getting a measurementoutside of the specification range for a conformingitem. This is often called the producers risk becauseconforming product would be needlessly rejected in thissituation. The second probability is that of getting ameasurement within specifications for a non-conforming item. Consumers risk is the term appliedto this probability, since there is a chance of non-conforming product being accepted.R3-1.1 For the purposes of this standard, the event ofrejecting an item whose true value lies inside of thespecification limits is considered a Type I error witherror rate (probability).R3-1.2 The event of accepting an item whose truevalue lies outside of the specification limits isconsidered a Type II error with error rate (probability).R3-1.3 One of the difficulties in formulating thestatistical model is that there are two or moredistributions involved, possibly in an interdependentfashion. Given a true underlying (fixed) value, x, asingle measurement of that value produces the obser-vation Y = x + U, where U is a random and unobs-ervable value attributable to measurement variability.If one takes n measurements of the same value x, i.e.,Y i = x + U i, where i = 1,, n, Y and U are treated asrandom variables from the observation andmeasurement variability distributions, respectively.The situation is further complicated if several x valuesare measured. In this situation, the x values come fromthe process (or characteristic) distribution X such thatY ij = Xj + U ij, where i = 1,, n and j = 1,, m. Therelationship between X and U is known as aconvolution. Additional distributions may be involvedif one assumes that certain characteristics of themeasurement process do not remain constant over themeasurement range. For example, one may assume thatbias is a function of the measured value. To model thisa third distribution would be needed, but the scope ofthis practice is limited to the use of only twodistributions (characteristic and measurementvariability). R3-2 The symbols in the equations derived for andhave the following meanings:X = random value attributable to the processcharacteristic,U = random and unobservable value attributableto measurement variability,f (x) = process characteristic PDF,G(u) = measurement variability CDF,USL = upper specification limit,LSL = lower specification limit, and(u) = Gaussian CDF.R3-3 The process characteristic PDF and measurementvariability CDF are assumed to be independent of eachother.R3-4 For a process characteristic with only a USL:R3-4.1 Define as a joint probability: \[ \] ( ) ( ) , 1USLP X USL X U USL G USL x f x dx   = ≤ + &gt; =     R3-4.2 Similarly, define as:\[ \] ( ) ( ) , USL P X USL X U USL G USL x f x dx = &gt; + ≤ =  R3-5 For a process characteristic with only an LSL, theformulae for and are: ( ) ( )LSLG LSL x f x dxa= - ( ) ( )1LSLG LSL x f x dxb- = - -

It was derived from task forcedeliberations during the development of the document. This related information was approved for publication byfull letter ballot procedures on September 3, 2003.R4-1 This example relates to the calculation of the costcomponents due to misclassification caused bymeasurement variability in flatness measurement duringwafer manufacturing. The following premises aremade:R4-1.1 A wafer manufacturer must supply a customerwith a specific number of wafers that conform to a siteflatness specification of 0.13 m, SFQR as defined inSEMI M1.R4-1.2 Most wafers produced do conform to thespecification. Due to variability in the manufacturingprocess, some wafers do not conform to thespecification.R4-1.3 The flatness measurement step is near the endof the wafer manufacturing process. It follows surfacepolishing and precedes final cleaning, surfaceinspection, and packaging.R4-1.4 All of the wafers are measured for site flatness.The measurement data is used to determine if wafersare passed for further processing and shipment or ifthey are failed and scrapped without further processing.This example premises no rework for failed wafers.R4-1.5 The customer is always able to detect a non-conforming wafer. When a non-conforming wafer isdetected, it is returned to the manufacturer and areplacement wafer must be supplied to satisfy thespecified order quantity.R4-2 The following steps follow the proceduresoutlined in Section 6.R4-2.1 Estimation of Process Distribution  A total of17,698 observations was made on flatnessmeasurements. An empirical estimate of the flatnessCDF was calculated from these data and is shown in thecolumn of Table R4-1 labeled F(x).R4.2.2 Estimation of Bias and Variance for EachGauge Compared  Two gauges are available. GaugeA has zero bias and a measurement variability ofA = 0.00433, which results in a P/T ratio of 10%,calculated in accordance with SEMI M27 for a singlesided distribution. Gauge B also has zero bias, but hasa measurement variability ofB = 0.00867 or a P/Tratio of 20%. Let the distribution of the measurementvariability for the two gauges be normally distributed with a mean of zero and standard deviations givenabove.R4-2.3 Calculation of and  To calculate and,one needs to estimate f(x) and (z), wherez = (USL x)/M.The values in the column labeled f(x) are derived bydividing the value in the count column by the totalnumber of observations. (z) is calculated from thenormal CDF using the numbers in the first column as x,0.13 as the USL, and either A = 0.00433 orB = 0.00867 for M, depending on whether Gauge A orGauge B is used. To calculate, for each row multiplyf(x) by 1 (z) and sum over all rows at or below thespecification limit. To calculate , for each rowmultiply f(x) by (z) and sum over all rows above theUSL. The calculations for and for the two P/Tratios of 10% and 20% can also be found in Table R4-1.R4-2.4 Decision Model  One of four situations mayoccur depending on the true flatness of the wafer,conforming or nonconforming, and the decision madebased on the output from the metrology equipment,pass or fail. Two correspond to correct actions: passinga conforming item and failing a nonconforming item.Zero incremental cost is associated with correctclassification. The two situations associated withmisclassification, passing a nonconforming item andfailing a conforming item, have actual incrementalcosts.R4-2.5 Estimation of Costs  For purposes ofillustration, let the cost of failing a conforming wafer(cfc) be $300 and the cost of passing a nonconforming(cpn) wafer be $220. The cost of ownership due to mea-surement variability and bias can then be calculated as:cost = cfc P( fail,conforming)+cpnP( pass, nonconforming)= cfc + cpnR4-2.6 Calculation of Costs  The cost componentsdue to measurement variability for Gauge A and GaugeB are:costA = cfcA + cpnA=(300)(0.01042530) + (220)(0.00011698) = 3.1533costB = cfcB + cpnB=(300)(0.01428055) + (220)(0.00145950) = 4.6053

SEMI M57-0705 © SEMI 2004, 20051 SEMI M57-0705GUIDE FOR SPECIFYING SILICON ANNEALED WAFERS This guide was technically approved by the global Silicon Wafer Committee. This edition was approved forpublication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on April 7, 2005. It was available atwww.semi.org in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005. Originally published July 2004; previouslypublished March 2005. 1 Purpose1.1 A number of device manufacturers utilize silicon annealed wafers to gain improved device characteristics. Thisguide provides information for developing specifications for silicon annealed wafers used to fabricate semiconductordevices and integrated circuits. 2 Scope2.1 This guide covers dimensional, electrical, chemical, and structural properties of silicon annealed wafers for180 nm, 130 nm, and 90 nm device technology generations.2.2 Based on the guidance herein, the user of the guide can generate specifications for silicon annealed wafers.2.3 One of the reasons for using annealed wafers is to allow a reduction in the crystal originated particles (COP)near the top surface region of the wafer. Currently, only the COP surface density can be estimated.2.4 The width of the denuded zone (DZ) free of bulk micro defects (BMD) is also an important parameter.However, there is no standardized method to evaluate this characteristic at the present time.2.5 The complete EDI Code List for items in the Order Form appropriate to silicon wafers, including annealedwafers, can be found in SEMI M18.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Referenced Standards and Documents3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specifications for Polished Monocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI M18  Format for Silicon Wafer Specification Form for Order EntrySEMI M33  Test Method for the Determination of Residual Surface Contamination on Silicon Wafers by Meansof Total Reflection X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (TXRF)SEMI M35  Guide for Developing Specifications for Silicon Wafer Surface Features Detected by AutomatedInspectionSEMI M45  Provisional Specification for 300 mm Wafer Shipping SystemSEMI M53  Practice for Calibrating Scanning Surface Inspection Systems Using Depositions of MonodispersePolystyrene Latex Sphere on Unpatterned Semiconductor Wafer SurfacesSEMI M58  Test Method for Evaluating DMA-Based Particle Deposition Systems and ProcessesSEMI M59  Terminology for Silicon TechnologySEMI MF81  Test Method for Measuring Radial Resistivity Variation on Silicon WafersSEMI MF391  Test Methods for Minority-Carrier Diffusion Length in Extrinsic Semiconductors by Measurementof Steady-State Surface PhotovoltageSEMI MF523  Practice for Unaided Visual Inspection of Polished Silicon Wafer SurfacesSEMI MF951  Test Method for Determination if Radial Interstitial Oxygen Variation in Silicon Wafers
