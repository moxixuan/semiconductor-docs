Overall,\n2592 die pads are analyzed in a lot.\n6. 2.5  When all the data is collected  and analyzed, each\nprobe  system  will  have  an  average  die  offset  value.\nThis  will  be  a  comparative  representation  of  accuracy\nconsisting of average offsets for all evaluated die.  This\ncomparative representation of accuracy is a measure of\nhow  accurate  the  probe  systems  place  the  chuck,  and\nthus  the  probe  needles,  to  the  center  point  on  the  die\npads,  consistent  with  normal  operation  of  the  probe\nsystems.\n6. 2.6   In  general,  when  the  probe  ma rks  are  viewed\nacross   all   dice,   there   will   be   a   data   spread,   or\ndistribution     of     error     points     for     each     wafer.\nRepeatability  is  the  \xb1  3\u03c3  variation  of  all  die  offsets,\nidentified   in   this   method   as   the   3\u03c3   calculation   of\nNormalized Die Offset.\n6. 3  Probe  Card  Issues  \u2013  Probe  car d  construction\nvariability  and  probe  card  usage  at  temperatures  other\nthan   ambient   are   important   considerations.      The\nfollowing sources of error should be kept in mind:\n\u2022 In  a  hot  chuck  environment  the  probe  card  and\nneedles  will  experience  a  high  percentage  of  the\nelevated chuck temperature.  The material selection\nfor  the  probe  card  will  determine  how  it  expands\nand   contracts   due   to   the   temperatures   applied.\nProbe systems can be equipped with programmable\npreheat  (soak)  times.    Longer  preheat  times  will\nreduce   probe   card   variability   while   decreasing\nthroughput.\n\u2022 Needle  construction  can  result  in  excessive  error\ndue  to  bending  of  the  needles  when  excessive\nprobe  system  z-stage  overdrive  is  applied.    The\nnumber  of  needles  and  the  selection  of  needle\ntechnology,   i.e.,   cantilever   versus   vertical,   is\nanother  variable,  having  a  noticeable  influence  on\nmeasurement results.\n\u2022 Since each user of this method is not confined to a\nstandard  for  probe  card  construction,  the  user  of\nthis  method  is  advised  to  choose  a  probe  card  and\nvendor  with  good  integrity,  and  to  use  that  same\nprobe    card    when    evaluating    multiple    probe\nsystems.  The assertion here is that the same probe\ncard used to evaluate multiple systems will react in\na  repeatable  manner  under  varying  environmental\nconditions.    This  assumes  there  is  no  excessive\nprobe   card   needle   wear   during   the   multiple\nevaluations,  and  that  needle  alignment  is  verified\nor    achieved    before    each    execution    of    the\nprocedure.\n6. 3.1  Probe mark scrub length can v ary due to several\nfactors including:\n\x01 variations  in  the  flatness  of  the  chuck  and\nstage travel that are not compensated by the z-\nsensor mapping algorithms\n\x01 by hard spots in the aluminum pads, or\n\x01 by variations in probe tip geometry, etc.\n6. 3.2   To  minimize  the  impact  of  this   variation  in  the\nprobe  mark  analysis  algorithm,  use  only  scrub  mark\nlocation  data  that  is  taken  normal  to  the  direction  of\nscrub.  Distances  measured  normal  to  the  orientation  of\nthe    scrub    mark    are    generally    accepted    to    be\nsignificantly   more   stable   than   that   which   is   taken\nparallel to the scrub mark (see Figure 2).\n6. 3.3   In  summary,  the  probe  card  its elf  can  be  a\nlimiting factor when making needle placement accuracy\nmeasurements,   especially   at   varying   environmental\nconditions.      Material   selection,   vendor   to   vendor\nvariation,  construction  of  a  probe  card  (blade,  epoxy\nring,     vertical,     etc.),     especially     with     varying\nenvironmental    conditions,    will    create    inconsistent\nanalysis    results,    unless    care    is    taken    with    the\napplication  of  this  method.    The  precautions  discussed\nhere  are  meant  to  promote  consistent  and  accurate\nevaluation results for this method.\n6. 3.4   Nevertheless,  the  precautions  m entioned  here\ncould   ALSO   be   an   important   basis   for   using   this\nmethod.    As  an  example,  a  probe  card  is  typically\ndesigned  for  XY  positional  placement  and  planarity,\nand    is    expected    to    meet    customer    specification\nrequirements in normal operation at room temperatures.\nThis  method  could  serve  as  a  means  of  establishing\nnumerical   results   that   represents   the   effects   that\ntemperature  or  probe  card  construction  variability  have\non probe card specification requirements.\n6. 4   The  PMA  Algorithm  \u2013  A  best-f it  rectangle  can  be\ndrawn   around   the   scrub   mark   and   the   passivation\nopening for each pad, reference Figure 3.\nNOTE:  Applying  a  best-fit  rectangle  around  the  passivation\nopening   may   prove   difficult   for   certain   vision   systems.\nApplication of the best-fit rectangle around the die pad metal\nis an acceptable alternative. The center position of the best-fit\nrectangle  around  the  scrub  mark  will  represent  the  center  of\nthe scrub mark. The center of the die pad is the center of the\nbest\u2014fit  rectangle  around  the  passivation  opening.    The\ndistance between the two centers is the pad offset.

The  stability  of  the  measurement  is\ngreater when made perpendicular to the direction of the\nscrub  mark.  This  will  establish  X  and  Y  offsets  via\nmeasurement of offsets for pads in the X and Y plane of\nthe die.\n6. 4.2   Once  the  offsets  are  establishe d,  a  two-step\nprocedure  will  manipulate  1296  X  and  1296  Y  offset\nvalues.    The  end  result  of  the  algorithm  will  be  a\nrelative measure of the total probe system accuracy and\nrepeatability for the pads analyzed.  Figure 5 represents\na visual summary of the method.\n6. 5  Considerations  of  Scale  \u2014  Wh en  evaluating  the\nsuitability  of  a  particular  probe  system  to  probe  a\nparticular  size  of  bond  pad,  or  to  probe  accurately  at  a\nparticular pad-to-pad pitch, a good rule of thumb is that\nthe   prober\u2019s   positional   accuracy,   as   stated   in   its\nspecifications,  should  be  1/10  that  of  the  scale  of  the\nfeatures to be probed.  For example, if the probe system\nbeing  evaluated  has  an  overall  placement  accuracy  of\n5\u03bcm, it would be inappropriate to analyze wafers using\nthis  method  and  this  probe  system  for  dice  that  have\npads  less  than  50  \u03bcm  square  (this  would  be  less  than\n10x).\n6. 5.1    Regardless,   when   this   method    is   used   for\nevaluation  of  multiple  systems,  it  is  essential  that  die\nand bond pad size/pitch consistency be maintained from\nevaluation   to   evaluation   if   the   results   are   to   be\nmeaningful.\n6. 5.2   The  same  10\xd7  rule  applies  to  t he  vision  system\nor automated Probe Mark Analysis system employed to\nmake   the   pad   offset   measurements.   These   systems\nshould  have  a  pixel  resolution  that  is  at  least  10\xd7  finer\nthan  the  die  pad  dimensions  associated  with  the  scrub\nmarks being measured.\n6. 6  Conclusion \u2014  It  is  assumed  th at  the  user  of  this\nmethod  has  a  wafer  probe  system  or  systems,  or  is\nplanning  to  make  a  selection  from  the  various  systems\navailable  in  the  market  place,  and  requires  objective\ncomparative  analysis  for  accuracy,  repeatability  and\nthroughput.\n6. 6.1   It  should  be  clear  that  this  met hod  employs  a\nthree-step    process    of    probing,    probe    mark    data\ncollection, and data analysis.\n6. 6.2   When  probing,  every  die  on  ea ch  of  the  ten\nwafers  is  to  be  \u201ctested\u201d  and  probed.    Of  those  ten\nwafers, the last nine with 12 die per wafer will be used\nfor scrub mark data collection.  At least 24 pads per die\nwill  be  used  for  the  analysis.    The  first  wafer  is  meant\nonly  to  allow  stabilization  for  the  probe  system  and  its\nprobe card."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI G78-0699 \xa9 SEMI 19996\nFigure 4\nRecommended Dice and Pads to be used for Data Collection\n6. 6.3 It  is  important  that  the  wafers  u sed  with  this\nmethod  are  probed  only  once,  or  else  multiple  scrub\nmarks  may  be  difficult  for  the  measurement  system  to\ndeal  with  and  will  most  likely  influence  the  analysis\nresults. This method assumes the wafer is ideal, having\nno die skew due to wafer process anomalies.\nNOTE:  It  is  possible  that  a  not  so  perfect  probe  tip  to  pad\nalignment  (PTTPA)  may  create  misleading  results  for  this\nmethod.  It  is  recommended  that  PTTPA  be  done  on  die\nlocated at the edge of the wafer, as shown in Figure 4. This is\nopposed  to  having  PTTPA  done  on  die  in  the  center  of  the\nwafer.  An  offset  error  incurred  in  the  context  of  a  PTTPA\ndone in the center may result in an incremental and continuing\nerror as testing moves across the wafer. With this method that\nerror may be averaged-out.\n6. 6.4   Probe  system  index  time  is  dev ice  and  probe\nsystem   dependent.      Probe   system   index   time   is\ndetermined    by    acceleration,    maximum    achievable\nvelocity,  and  distance  traveled  die  to  die  by  the  chuck.\nThus,  the  device  type  chosen  for  use  with  this  method\nshould    be    representative    of    typical    die    size    if\nmeaningful  index  time  and  throughput  data  are  to  be\ngathered."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,'SEMI G78-0699 \xa9 SEMI 19997\n6. 6.5   If  the  results  of  this  method  tu rn  out  to  be\nunfavorable, the user has the option of applying a more\ndetailed,   enhanced   data   analysis   application   of   this\nmethod.

A  summary  of  the  enhanced\nmethod is shown in Figure 6.\n6. 7  Alternatives \u2014  What  has  been   left  undefined  to\nthis  point  is  availability  of  an  automated  approach  to\ndata  collection  per  the  requirements  of  this  method.\nRegardless,     data     collection     can     be     manually\naccomplished.    The  manual  process  is  laborious  and\nrequires   a   video   measuring   system   to   make   offset\nmeasurements  on  the  die  pads,  and  a  spreadsheet  to\nanalyze the resulting data.\n6. 7.1   If  manual  operation  is  not  desi rable  or  practical,\nautomated Probe Mark Analysis Systems do exist in the\nmarket place as an item to be purchased.  Providers are\nalso  available  to  accept  probed  wafers  and  execute\nprobe mark analysis under contract as a service.\nNOTE: A  Final  Note  to  the  User  of  This  Method \u2014  This\nmethod  provides  sufficient  data  for  sophisticated  analysis  of\nprobe  system  performance  across  die-to-die,  wafer-to-wafer,\nand setup-to-setup.  It also provides a simple metric.  It is easy\nto  make  comparisons  with  simple  "single  number"  metrics,\nbut   that   has   the   potential   for   oversight,   distortion   and\nsubsequent  inappropriate  comparisons.    The  test  engineer,\nworking with the probe system supplier, must be the ultimate\njudge  of  the  applicability  of  this  method  and  the  correct\ninterpretation of the results.\nDIE\n3\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\u03c3\nAverage Die Offset\nThree sigma calculation of Die Offset Values\nDie to Die X and Die to Die Y variation\n',"[REPEATABILITY]","\nVISION SYSTEM or PROBE MARK ANALYSIS SYSTEM\nESTABLISH\nPAD OFFSETS\nOffset from the center of the bond pad to the center of the scrub mark for Lot-X and Lot-Y\nAverage Die Offset\nAverage all Pad Offsets by die\n(Avg. of 108 Lot-X and Avg. of 108\nLot-Y values)\nSETUPLOT\n1\n2\nWAFER\nFigure 5\nPad Offset and Two-Step Analysis Algorithm for Determining Probe System Error"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI G78-0699 \xa9 SEMI 19998\nDIE\nNormalized Die Offset\n(Normalized by Lot)\nAverage Die Offset - Average Lot Offset\n","[ACCURACY- TOTAL PROBE SYSTEM ERROR]","\nThree Sigma Normalized Die Offset\n(Normalized by Lot)\nThree sigma calculation of\nNormalized Die Offset Value\n","[REPEATABILITY]","\nThree Sigma Total Probe System Error Range\nAverage Lot Offset +/- Total Probe System Error\nVISION SYSTEM or PROBE MARK ANALYSIS SYSTEM\nESTABLISH\nPAD OFFSETS\nOffset from the center of the bond pad to the center of the scrub mark for all pads analyzed\nAverage Die Offset\nAverage all Pad Offsets by\ndie\nNormalized Pad Offset\n(Normalized by Die)\nPad Offset \u2013 Avg.

Overall   Timing   Accuracy\n(OTA)   is   made   up   of   three   components,   and   by\ndefinition  is  the  aggregate  timing  error  comprised  of\ninput  edge  placement  accuracy  (see  Section  7.1.1),\noutput edge placement accuracy (see Section 7.1.2), and\ninput to output timing accuracy (see Section 7.1.3).  It\u2019s\nimportant   to   note   that   the   OTA   specification   and\nassociated graphical representation shown in Figure 1 is\nmeant to encompass timing delay errors across multiple\nmachines,  as  well  as  multiple  calibrations  for  a  single\nmachine over time.\n6. 2.1   Our  experience  in  dealing  with    multiple-pin\nautomated  test  systems  reveals  that  not  all  input  drive\ncircuits can place a drive edge at exactly the same point\nin  time  relative  to  a  common  reference.    The  same  is\ntrue for output compare circuits when placing compare\nedges.    Thus,  these  edges  tend  to  have  an  (error)\ndistribution around some average value relative to their\nintended placement.  This is due in part to the inherent\nanomalies associated with electronic circuits that make-\nup  these  edge  placement  elements.    The  distribution  of\nedge  error  is  graphically  shown  for  input  (see  Section\n7. 1.1)  and  output  edge  (see  Section  7.1.2)  signals  in\nFigure 1.\n6. 2.2     Drive    Input    to    Compare    Outpu t    Timing\nAccuracy  (Section  7.1.3)  can  be  described  in  different\nways.    It  is  easy  to  think  of  this  parameter,  per  the\ndefinition  given  in  this  document,  Section  7.1.3,  as\nsimply  the  relative  time  difference  (skew)  between  the\ndrive  delay  timing  error  distribution  and  the  compare\ndelay timing error distribution for a particular machine.\nBut  this  parameter,  once  established  for  a  machine,  is\nnot  necessarily  constant.    For  example,  this  parameter\ncan  change  from  one  calibration  of  a  machine  at  a\nparticular  time,  to  something  different,  as  a  result  of  a\nsubsequent  calibration  of  that  same  machine.    As  well,\nthis  parameter  can  also  be  considered  as  a  machine  to\nmachine accuracy parameter, not necessarily having the\nsame  value  between  any  two  machines  of  the  same\nkind.\n6. 2.3  Thus, on each machine and at  different points in\ntime for the same machine the Drive Input to Compare\nOutput  Timing  skew  can  be  uniquely  different  per\nmachine.

The\nhierarchy  supports  two  levels  of  specification  analysis.\nBroad,  composite  net  results  are  available  by  using  the\nATE for self-analysis in Level 1.\n6. 2   At  this  level,  a  large  amount  o f  data  can  be  effi-\nciently  collected,  representing  the  net  conformance  to\noverall timing accuracy specifications.  This technique,\nhowever,  precludes  isolation  and  detailed  analysis  of\nspecific  accuracy  components.    Therefore,  a  second\nlevel  of  analysis,  incorporating  external  instruments  is\nincluded. While the first level provides efficient, broad\nanalysis,   the   second   level   provides   less   efficient,\ndetailed analysis.\n6. 3   Results  from  the  analyses  are  s aved  in  a  standard\nformat  to  facilitate  further  use  for  application  specific\ndata reduction.

The  reference  used  for  driver\ntransition   time   measurements   is   a   high   bandwidth-\ndigital sampling oscilloscope.\n10. 4.3.1    The   tolerance   for   driver   transit ion   time\nmeasurements  is  \xb1  150ps\n11\ndue  to  the  tester/instrument"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"11 This 150ps tolerance has been extended beyond 20ps due to level\nsensitivities associated with oscilloscopes and typical bandwidth\nvariations in oscilloscope probes rendering transition time measurements\nless accurate."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0},2073(e,n,t){t.d(n,{A:()=>i});var a=t(6540);const i=function({pdfLink:e,pdfSize:n,title:t,description:i}){if(!e)return null;const o=e.startsWith("http"),r=(e=>{if(!e)return null;try{const n=new URL(e,o?void 0:window.location.origin);return n.pathname.split("/").pop()}catch{return e.split("/").pop()}})(e);return a.createElement("div",{className:"pdf-download-card"},a.createElement("div",{className:"pdf-download-card__header"},a.createElement("div",{className:"pdf-download-card__icon"},"\ud83d\udce5"),a.createElement("div",{className:"pdf-download-card__title"},a.createElement("h3",null,"\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5b8c\u6574PDF"),t&&a.createElement("p",{className:"pdf-download-card__doc-title"},t))),a.createElement("div",{className:"pdf-download-card__info"},a.createElement("div",{className:"pdf-download-card__meta"},a.createElement("span",{className:"pdf-download-card__label"},"\u6587\u4ef6\u5927\u5c0f:"),a.createElement("span",{className:"pdf-download-card__value"},"string"==typeof(s=n)?s:s<1048576?`${(s/1024).toFixed(1)}KB`:`${(s/1024/1024).toFixed(1)}MB`)),i&&a.createElement("div",{className:"pdf-download-card__description"},i),o&&a.createElement("div",{className:"pdf-download-card__notice"},a.createElement("span",{className:"pdf-download-card__notice-icon"},"\u2139\ufe0f"),a.createElement("span",null,"\u6b64\u6587\u4ef6\u6258\u7ba1\u5728GitHub Releases\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981GitHub\u8d26\u53f7"))),a.createElement("div",{className:"pdf-download-card__actions"},a.createElement("a",{href:e,className:"pdf-download-card__button pdf-download-card__button--primary",download:o?void 0:r,target:o?"_blank":void 0,rel:o?"noopener noreferrer":void 0},a.createElement("span",{className:"pdf-download-card__button-icon"},"\u2b07\ufe0f"),"\u4e0b\u8f7dPDF"),o&&a.createElement("a",{href:e,className:"pdf-download-card__button pdf-download-card__button--secondary",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},a.createElement("span",{className:"pdf-download-card__button-icon"},"\ud83d\udd17"),"\u5728\u65b0\u7a97\u53e3\u6253\u5f00")));var s}},5680(e,n,t){t.d(n,{xA:()=>c,yg:()=>p});var a=t(6540);function i(e,n,t){return n in e?Object.defineProperty(e,n,{value:t,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[n]=t,e}function o(e,n){var t=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var a=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);n&&(a=a.filter(function(n){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,n).enumerable})),t.push.apply(t,a)}return t}function r(e){for(var n=1;n<arguments.length;n++){var t=null!=arguments[n]?arguments[n]:{};n%2?o(Object(t),!0).forEach(function(n){i(e,n,t[n])}):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(t)):o(Object(t)).forEach(function(n){Object.defineProperty(e,n,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(t,n))})}return e}function s(e,n){if(null==e)return{};var t,a,i=function(e,n){if(null==e)return{};var t,a,i={},o=Object.keys(e);for(a=0;a<o.length;a++)t=o[a],n.indexOf(t)>=0||(i[t]=e[t]);return i}(e,n);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var o=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(a=0;a<o.length;a++)t=o[a],n.indexOf(t)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,t)&&(i[t]=e[t])}return i}var l=a.createContext({}),d=function(e){var n=a.useContext(l),t=n;return e&&(t="function"==typeof e?e(n):r(r({},n),e)),t},c=function(e){var n=d(e.components);return a.createElement(l.Provider,{value:n},e.children)},m={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var n=e.children;return a.createElement(a.Fragment,{},n)}},h=a.forwardRef(function(e,n){var t=e.components,i=e.mdxType,o=e.originalType,l=e.parentName,c=s(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),h=d(t),p=i,u=h["".concat(l,".").concat(p)]||h[p]||m[p]||o;return t?a.createElement(u,r(r({ref:n},c),{},{components:t})):a.createElement(u,r({ref:n},c))});function p(e,n){var t=arguments,i=n&&n.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||i){var o=t.length,r=new Array(o);r[0]=h;var s={};for(var l in n)hasOwnProperty.call(n,l)&&(s[l]=n[l]);s.originalType=e,s.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:i,r[1]=s;for(var d=2;d<o;d++)r[d]=t[d];return a.createElement.apply(null,r)}return a.createElement.apply(null,t)}h.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
