SEMI M58-0704 © SEMI 20041 SEMI M58-0704TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING DMA BASED PARTICLEDEPOSITION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES This test method was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on April 22, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org May 2004;to be published July 2004. 1 Purpose1.1 SEMI M52 requires the use of certified referencematerials (CRMs) for calibration of scanning surfaceinspection systems (SSISs). The calibration method isdefined in SEMI M53. This test method provides theprocedure to determine whether a specific particledeposition system, using a differential mobilityanalyzer (DMA), can produce the required CRMs.1.2 Both organizations producing depositions internallyfor in-house use and companies manufacturingdepositions for sale can apply this test method to ensurethat their particle deposition systems providedepositions that meet the requirements of SEMI M52. 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers determination of thedeposition peak diameter and the associated expandedrelative combined peak diameter uncertainty producedby a particle deposition system and its associateddeposition procedures for comparison to the 3%requirement of SEMI M52.2.2 This test method also covers determination of theability of the deposition system to produce depositionswith diameter distributions that are less than 5% fullwidth at half maximum (FWHM) as required by SEMIM52 even when using a particle source with a muchwider distribution.2.3 These tests require that the deposition systememploy a DMA (or an equivalent programmablefiltering system) to accomplish both peak diameterdetermination and narrowing of particle sourcedistributions (see Related Information 1).2.4 This test method covers determination ofrepeatability over a period of one week. Tests can berepeated periodically to determine long term stability.Long term stability of most DMA-based particledeposition systems is believed to be on the order of ayear or more, but it is recommended that the tests berepeated on an annual basis or whenever the instrumentappears to be out of control.2.5 This test method requires the use of three differentkinds of particle distributions with specified characteristics and wafers that have surfacecharacteristics adequate to allow detection of thesmallest particles utilized with a capture rate of greaterthan 95%.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This test method is limited to use of depositions ofPSL spheres, even though the deposition system undertest may be capable of depositing particles of othermaterials.3.2 When used to make a deposition from a suspensionof PSL spheres that does not have an observablecertified peak diameter (or if the deposition is made at asize away from the peak of the distribution in thesuspension), the uncertainty with which the depositionsystem evaluates a peak deposition diameter includesbias information determined from measurements on aknown standard or standards with extremely narrowdistributions. At the time when this test method wasdeveloped, only one such standard existed. Therefore ifthe bias contribution to uncertainty is a function of thepeak diameter in the suspension, the determination maybe in error at peak diameters away from that of theknown standard.3.3 There is the possibility that the deposited particlediameter may differ slightly from the certified value forthe bottle containing the suspension because thesurfactant in the suspension and contaminants in thewater may cause an increase in particle size. Thislimitation can be avoided by using DMAs with thesame spray system, the same purity of dilution water,and the same suspension concentration both to size theparticles in the bottle and make the deposition. Thispossibility may be minimized by using PSL suspensionfluids with low non-volatile content to reduce thepossibility of non-volatile materials drying onto theparticles in the suspension.

Bottles B(smaller diameters) and C (larger diameters) have muchwider distributions and there are no restrictions on peakdiameter accuracy.6.2 Over a five day period, spot depositions of the samenumber of each of the three PSL sphere sizes are madeeach morning on one or more wafers and a final scancheck of the diameter of spheres in Bottle A is madelate in the day. 1 International Organization for Standardization, ISO CentralSecretariat, 1, rue de Varemb, Case postale 56, CH-1211 Geneva 20,Switzerland.

The FWHM values are obtained fromthese histograms and recorded. The peak diametervalues and particle counts found from the SSIS mayalso be recorded, but these values are not required toverify the requirements of SEMI M52.6.5 The results for each bottle are analyzed to determineif the deposition system has a peak diameter expandedrelative combined standard uncertainty less than 3%and a deposited FWHM on the wafer of less than 5%,as required by SEMI M52. 7 Apparatus7.1 Particle Deposition System7.1.1 The particle deposition system to be evaluatedmust be available in a clean room of class 4 or better asdefined in ISO 14644-1.7.1.2 The deposition system must have an atomizerthat takes the particles from the liquid suspension to anair droplet mist.7.1.3 The particle deposition system must have a DMA(or an equivalent programmable filtering system) toaccomplish both peak diameter determination andnarrowing of particle source distributions.7.1.4 The deposition system must have wafer handlingequipment appropriate for the wafers on which thedepositions are being made.7.2 Surface Scanning Inspection System7.2.1 An SSIS appropriate for use with the wafers usedand the PSL spheres deposited must be capable ofdetermining the FWHM of each of the depositionsmade.7.2.2 The SSIS does not have to be calibrated inaccordance with SEMI M53 in order to be used in thistest method, but the results obtained when the testmethod is performed can give an indication of thecalibration of the SSIS in the size region of the test. 8 Reagents and Materials8.1 PSL Spheres8.1.1 Three types of PSL liquid sphere suspensions areused in this test method.8.1.1.1 Bottle A is a CRM that contains a suspension ofPSL spheres with a relative expanded peak diameteruncertainty much less than 3% and a FWHM less than

SEMI M58-0704 © SEMI 20047 RELATED INFORMATION 1BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE OPERATION OF ADIFFERENTIAL MOBILITY ANALYZER NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI M58 and was derived from informationdeveloped during drafting of the standard. This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballotprocedures on April 22, 2004. R1-1 Deposition systems include a nebulizer forproducing a PSL sphere aerosol by spraying andevaporating a suspension of PSL spheres in high puritywater, a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) forselecting a monodisperse fraction of the aerosol, andthen a chamber to electrostatically deposit the spheresonto wafers. Here we focus on the DMA, which is usedfor both isolating a monodisperse size fraction and forsizing the particles. A brief description of theinstrumentation and methodology is given below; adetailed description is given by Kinney et al. 3 R1-2 The particles leaving the nebulizer pass through abipolar charger that produces a charge distribution thatdepends only on the size of the particles and not ontheir initial charge. For 100 nm particles, about 45% ofthe particles are uncharged, about 20% have +1 electroncharge, another 20% have 1 electron charge, and muchsmaller fractions have multiple charges. As illustratedin Figure R1-1, the DMA consists of an innercylindrical rod connected to a variable high voltage dcpower supply and an outer annular tube connected toground. Clean sheath air flows through the axialregion, while the charged aerosol enters through anaxisymmetric opening along the outer cylinder. Thepositively charged PSL spheres move radially towardsthe center rod under the influence of the electric field.Near the bottom of the classifying region, a fraction ofthe air flow consisting of near-monodisperse aerosolexits through a slit in the center rod. The quantitymeasured by the DMA is the electrical mobility, Z p,defined as the velocity a particle attains under a unitelectric field. Knutson and Whitby4 derived an expres-sion for the average value of Z p for particles enteringthe slit involving the peak electrode voltage, V, thesheath air flow rate, Q c, the inner and outer radii of thecylinders, r1 and r2 , and the length of the centralelectrode down to the slit, L: 3 Kinney, P.D., Pui, D.

MonodisperseAerosol Excess Air ChargedAerosolCleanAirHigh Voltage Figure R1-1Monodisperse Aerosol Selected in a DifferentialMobility Analyzer from a Polydisperse AerosolBased on the Size Dependence of the ElectricalMobility =12ln2 rrVLQZ cp (R1-1) R1-3 This equation is valid provided the sheath airflow, Q c, is equal to the excess flow, Q m, leaving theclassifier. They derived an expression for the transferfunction, defined as the probability that a particle willleave the sampling slit. The transfer function is of greatimportance, because the size distribution of the aerosolexiting the DMA is proportional to the convolution ofthe transfer function with the particle size distributionfunction. The transfer function has a triangular shapewith a peak value of 1. The ratio of the base of thetransfer function triangle in terms of voltage divided bythe peak voltage is predicted to be 2(Q s/Qc), where Q sis the flow of monodisperse aerosol. R1-4 This ratio is also equal to the ratio of the fullwidth of the mobility distribution to the peak value.For a flow ratio of 1 to 20, one finds that the full widthat half maximum of the peak mobility (FWHM) isequal to 5% of the peak mobility. For 100 nm particle

SEMI M58-0704 © SEMI 2004 8 size, the corresponding FWHM in terms of particlediameter is about 3%. R1-5 The relationship between electrical mobility andparticle diameter, D p, is obtained by equating theelectric field force of a singly charged particle with theStokes friction force, ppp DDCeZ 3)(= (R1-2) where is the dynamic viscosity of air, and e is theelectron charge. The Cunningham slip correction,C(D p), corrects for the non-continuum gas behavior onthe motion of small particles.R1-6 For increased accuracy, the DMA can becalibrated using the NIST SRM 1963 (100 nm) PSLspheres.5 The voltage corresponding to the peakparticle concentration for the 100.7 nm SRM isdetermined and then the peak voltage is determined forthe unknown. The electrical mobility of the 100.7 nmSRM, Z SRM, is computed from Equation (R1-2) usingthe best available values for the viscosity, Cunninghamslip correction, and the electron charge.6 The mobilityof the unknown particle, Z x, is then computed based onthe voltage ratio and the mobility of the 100.7 nm SRM,Z SRM: SRMxSRMx ZVVZ = (R1-3) The peak particle diameter is computed using Equation(R1-2). Because the slip correction is a function of thediameter, an iterative process is used. In cases wheresamples have a broad size distribution, a correctionfactor is used that is based on the instrumentconvolution integral and involves the product of thetransfer function times, the charging probability, andthe size distribution (see Related Information 1 ofSEMI M53 for a further discussion of the effect of thetransfer function). 5 Donnelly, M.

SEMI M58-0704 © SEMI 20049 RELATED INFORMATION 2EXAMPLE OF A COMPLETED DATA AND ANALYSIS SHEET NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI M58 and was derived from informationdeveloped during drafting of the standard. This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballotprocedures on April 22, 2004. R2-1 Figure R2-1 shows an example of a completeddata set. This example is the result of using aspreadsheet that automates the calculations of Section11. If such a spreadsheet is constructed, once the datais input as described in Section 10 the results of the testare found by spreadsheet calculation. R2-2 In this example the results obtained indicate thatthe deposition system is capable of meeting therequirements of SEMI M52 for all three bottles. Notethat the test was done with an SSIS that was notcalibrated according to SEMI M53. R2-3 The following sections detail the spreadsheetexample in Figure R2-1 in order to allow it to be easilyduplicated for use with this test method. Information inthe shaded cells is entered in accordance with theprocedures given in Section 10.R2-3.1 At the top of the spreadsheet, the entries inrows 1 through 13 are obvious except for those in cellsH10 through H12. Here, the uncertainties on the bottleare converted to %. In this example, Bottle C does nothave a peak diameter uncertainty given. This is true formany older bottles where diameters were given in termsof mean, rather than peak, diameters. To avoidreturning an error result, the formula for the percentageis =IF(SUM(Ei&gt;0,Ei/Ci,"not available"), wherei = 10,11, or 12 for Bottle A, B, or C, respectively. The cell isformatted for % with one decimal place.R2-3.2 In the section on Deposition System Diametersand the three SSIS Data sections the inputs are takendirectly from the instrumentation as directed in Section10. As an example, the equation to compute mean inB23 is: =AVERAGE(B18:B22). The equation tocompute s Dep in B24 is: =STDEV(B18:B22)/B23 and isformatted for % with one decimal place.R2-3.3 The portion of the data sheet labeled DepSystem Sizing Corrections starting at A26 uses allBottle A results to correct any offset in the meandiameter found by deposition system and to evaluatethe pooled relative standard deviation for systemrepeatability. Mean A is given by: =(B23+E23)/2. s DepAis given by: =SQRT((B24^2+E24^2)/2), and includesday long contributions from system stability. The biascorrection CertAMean A is given by: =C10-C27. R2-3.4 AnalysisR2-3.4.1 The value for Dep Peak Uncertainty (row 34)for Bottle A (or U relA ) is given by:=2\*SQRT(C28^2+H10^2). This combines theuncertainty in the certified bottle with the uncertainty inthe deposition system at the diameter of Bottle A. Thefactor of 2 is needed for expanded uncertainty.R2-3.4.2 The expanded uncertainty equations forBottles B and C are slightly different and are thecombination of the relative uncertainty in the certifiedvalue A (as a percent) and the relative uncertainty of thedeposition system at the broader distribution ofdiameter B or C. The equation for the expandedrelative combined standard uncertainty of thedepositions of Bottle B is: =2\*SQRT(C24^2+H10^2),and of those of Bottle C is: =2\*SQRT(D24^2+H10^2).As noted in the standard (see 11.5 and 11.6), the firstterm of this equation accounts for the variation due tothe uncertainty in the finding of the peak diameter ofBottle B or C by the DMA and the second termaccounts for the uncertainty in the certified peakdiameter of the suspension in Bottle A, which is used tocorrect the peak diameter of Bottle B or C as found bythe DMA.R2-3.4.3 The FWHM (SSIS) values for Bottles A, B,and C (row 35) are taken directly from D40, D52 andJ29, respectively.R2-3.4.4 The uncorrected Peak (Dep System)diameters for Bottles A, B, and C (row 36) are takendirectly from C27, C23, and D23 respectively.R2-3.4.5 The corrections made in the next row (37)employ the percentage error found by comparing thecertified peak diameter of Bottle A to the mean peakdiameter found by the deposition system. For Bottle Athis is: =C27+C29. For Bottle B it is:=C23\*(1+(C29/C10), and for Bottle C it is:=D23\*(1+(C29/C10).R2-3.4.6 The Peak (SSIS) values Bottles A, B, and C(row 38) are taken directly from B40, B52, and H29,respectively.R2-3.4.7 The Measured Counts (row 39) are takendirectly from the SSIS data averages, E40, E52, or K29,for Bottles A, B, and C, respectively.

SEMI M59-0305 © SEMI 2005 4 4.63 XLS  extended light scatterer, a relatively large surface defect on silicon wafers, such as scratches andregions of high surface roughness. 5 Definitions5.1 acceptor  an impurity in a semiconductor that accepts electrons excited from the valence band, leading to holeconduction.5.2 anisotropic, adj.  exhibiting different physical properties in differing crystallographic directions.5.3 anisotropic etch  a selective etch that exhibits an accelerated etch rate along specific crystallographicdirections.5.3.1 Discussion  Anisotropic etches are used to determine crystal orientation, to fabricate micromechanicalstructures, and to facilitate dielectric component isolation.5.4 annealed wafer  wafer that has a defect (COP) free zone near the surface resulting from high temperatureannealing under a neutral or reducing atmosphere.5.5 back surface  the exposed surface opposite to that upon which active semiconductor devices have been or willbe fabricated.5.6 backseal  a film of silicon dioxide or other insulator placed over the back surface of a silicon wafer to inhibitoutdiffusion of the majority dopant impurity.5.7 backside  not preferred, use back surface.5.8 bow  the deviation of the center point of the median surface of a free, unclamped wafer from a median-surfacereference plane established by three points equally spaced on a circle with diameter a specified amount less than thenominal diameter of the wafer.5.9 carrier  an entity capable of carrying electric charge through a solid, for example, valence holes andconduction electrons in semiconductors; also known as charge carrier.5.10 chem-mechanical polish  a process for the removal of surface material from the wafer that uses chemical andmechanical actions to achieve a mirror-like surface for subsequent processing.5.11 chip  region where material has been unintentionally removed from the surface or edge of the wafer.5.12 cleavage plane  a crystallographically preferred fracture plane.5.13 concentration  relative amount of a minority constituent of a mixture to the majority constituent (forexample parts per million, parts per billion, or percent) by either volume or weight.5.14 conductivity (electrical),  \[(Ωcm)1 \]  a measure of the ease with which charge carriers flow in a material;the reciprocal of resistivity.5.14.1 Discussion  In a semiconductor, the conductivity is proportional to the product of free carrier density,electron electrical charge, and carrier mobility. Most variant of all crystal properties, conductivity can range over 13orders of magnitude. Conductivity can be locally modified by temperature, carrier injection, irradiation, or magneticfield.5.15 conductivity type  a property that identifies the majority charge carrier in the semiconductor; see also n-type,p-type.5.16 contaminant, particulate  see localized light scatterer.5.17 contamination, area  matter, unintentionally added to the surface of a wafer, of extent greater than a singlelocalized light scatterer.5.17.1 Discussion  Area contamination, a type of extended light scatterer, may be foreign matter on the wafersurface resulting from chuck marks, finger or glove prints, stains, wax or solvent residues, etc.5.18 contamination, particulate  a particle or particles on the surface of a wafer, see localized light scatterer.5.19 crack  cleavage or fracture that extends to the surface of a wafer.

SEMI M59-0305 © SEMI 20055 5.20 crater  surface feature with irregular closed ridges and smooth central regions.5.21 Crows foot  intersecting cracks in a pattern resembling a crow's foot (Y) on (111) surfaces and a cross (+)on (100) surfaces.5.22 crystal defect  departure from the ideal arrangement of atoms in a crystal.5.23 crystal indices  see Miller indices.5.24 crystal originated pit, COP  a small pit or plurality of small pits introduced during crystal growth that act asan LLS when they intersect the surface of a wafer.5.24.1 Discussion  Because they act in some ways similarly to particles when viewed with an SSIS, this defectwas originally called a crystal originated particle. Modern SSISs can, however, generally distinguish COPs fromparticles. Surface cleaning or light etching frequently increases the size and number of COPs observed, when theyare present.5.25 crystallographic notation  a symbolism based on Miller indices used to label planes and directions in acrystal as follows: plane (111) family of planes &#123;111&#125; direction \[111\] family of directions &lt;111&gt;5.26 denuded zone  a volume in a wafer, usually located just under the front surface, in which the oxygen contenthas been lowered so that the bulk microdefect (oxide precipitate) density is reduced.5.27 diameter, of a semiconductor wafer  the linear dimension across the surface of a circular wafer that containsthe wafer center and excludes flats or other peripheral fiduciary geometries.5.28 dimple  a shallow depression with gently sloping sides that exhibits a concave, spheroidal shape and isvisible to the unaided eye under proper lighting conditions.5.29 dislocation etch pit  a pit generated by a preferential etch where a dislocation meets the surface of a wafer.5.30 donor  an impurity or imperfection in a semiconductor that donates electrons to the conduction band, leadingto electron conduction.5.31 dopant  a chemical element, usually from the third or fifth columns of the periodic table, incorporated intrace amounts in a silicon crystal to establish its conductivity type and resistivity.5.32 dopant striation rings  helical features on the surface of a silicon wafer associated with local variations inimpurity concentration.5.33 doping, v.  addition of specific impurities to a semiconductor to control the electrical resistivity.5.34 edge exclusion, nominal, EE  the distance from the FQA boundary to the periphery of a wafer of nominaldimensions.5.35 edge profile  on edge contoured wafers (whose edges have been shaped chemically or mechanically), adescription of the contour of the boundary of the wafer that joins the front and back surfaces.5.36 etch  a solution, a mixture of solutions, or a mixture of gases that attacks the surfaces of a film or substrate,removing material either selectively or nonselectively.5.37 etch pit  a pit, resulting from preferential etching, localized on the surface of a wafer at a crystal defect orstressed region.5.38 extended light scatterer (XLS)  a feature larger than the spatial resolution of the inspection equipment, on orin a wafer surface, resulting in increased light scattering intensity relative to that of the surrounding wafer surface.5.38.1 Discussion  Origins of XLSs include area contamination and unresolved clusters of localized lightscatterers, such as particles or COPs. When oberved by the unaided eye, an XLS can usually be seen under high

SEMI M59-0305 © SEMI 2005 6 intensity illumination. Some SSISs have sensors for reporting XLSs. XLSs can be observed as increased hazeunder dark field conditions. Under bright field conditions, an XLS can be observed as a decrease in the intensity ofthe specularly reflected beam, sometimes called a light channel defect.5.39 extrinsic, adj.  (1) the region in the conductivity-temperature curve where the conduction in a wafer isdominated by holes or electrons from dopant atoms; (2) a process, such as extrinsic gettering, caused by factorsoutside the crystal of the wafer itself.5.40 fiducial  a flat or a notch on a wafer intended to provide a location referenced to its crystallographic axes.5.41 fixed quality area, FQA  the central area of a wafer surface, defined by a nominal edge exclusion, EE, overwhich the specified values of a parameter apply.5.41.1 Discussion  The boundary of the FQA is at all points the distance EE away from the periphery of a waferof nominal dimensions. The size of the FQA is independent of wafer diameter and flat length tolerances. For thepurposes of defining the FQA, the periphery of a wafer of nominal dimensions at a location with a notch is assumedto follow the circumference of a circle with diameter equal to the nominal wafer diameter. It may be necessary tospecify exclusion areas where the values of a specified parameter do not apply for regions like: the notch, lasermarks, or where handling/gripping devices contact the wafer.5.42 flat  a portion of the periphery of a circular wafer that has been removed to a chord; see also primary flat,secondary flat.5.43 flat diameter  the linear dimension across the surface of a semiconductor wafer from the center of the flatthrough the wafer center to the circumference of the wafer on the opposite edge along the diameter perpendicular tothe flat.5.43.1 Discussion  The flat diameter is most often associated with the primary flat. In the case of opposingprimary and secondary flats, as occurs on &#123;100&#125; n-type wafers 125 mm and smaller in diameter, the concept of flatdiameter does not apply because the diameter perpendicular to the flats does not intersect the wafer circumference.5.44 flatness  for wafer surfaces, the deviation of the front surface, expressed in TIR or maximum FPD relative toa specified reference plane when the back surface of the wafer is ideally flat, as when pulled down by a vacuum ontoan ideally clean flat chuck.5.44.1 Discussion  The flatness of a wafer may be described as either: the global flatness, the maximum value of site flatness as measured on all sites, or the percentage of sites that have a site flatness equal to or less than a specified value.NOTE 1: See Appendix 1 of SEMI M1 for a complete discussion of flatness parameters.5.45 focal plane  the plane perpendicular to the optical axis of an imaging system that contains the focal point ofthe imaging system.5.45.1 Discussion  The reference plane used by an imaging system is coincident with or parallel with the focalplane. Full field imaging systems employ coincident global focal and reference planes. Partial field imagingsystems employ either coincident site focal and reference planes or displaced site focal and global reference planes.If the reference plane is not coincident with the focal plane, it is displaced from the focal plane so that the point onthe front surface at a site center lies in the focal plane.5.46 focal plane deviation, FPD  the distance parallel to the optical axis from a point on the wafer surface to thefocal plane.5.47 four-point probe  an electrical probe arrangement for determining the resistivity of a material in whichseparate pairs of contacts are used (1) for passing current through the specimen and (2) measuring the potential dropcaused by the current.5.48 front side  not preferred; use front surface.5.49 front surface  the exposed surface upon which active semiconductor devices have been or will be fabricated.

SEMI M59-0305 © SEMI 20057 5.50 gettering  the process that immobilizes impurities at locations away from the region of the specimen to beinvestigated.5.51 global flatness  the TIR or the maximum FPD relative to a specified reference plane within the FQA.5.52 gradient, resistivity  not preferred; use resistivity variation.5.53 groove  a shallow scratch with rounded edges that is usually the remnant of a scratch not completelyremoved by polishing.5.54 haze  non-localized light-scattering resulting from surface topography (microroughness) or from denseconcentrations of surface or near-surface imperfections; see also laser light-scattering event.5.54.1 Discussion  Haze due to the existence of a collection of imperfections is a mass effect; individualimperfections of the type that result in haze cannot be readily distinguished by the eye or other optical detectionsystem without magnification. In a scanning surface inspection system, haze results in a background signal; thissignal and laser light-scattering events together comprise the signal due to light-scattering from a wafer surface.5.55 hole  a mobile vacancy in the electronic valence structure of a semiconductor that acts like a positiveelectron charge with positive mass; the majority carrier in p-type material.5.56 indent  an edge defect that extends from the front surface to the back surface of a silicon wafer.5.57 ingot  a cylinder or rectangular solid of polycrystalline or single crystal silicon, generally of slightly irregulardimensions.5.57.1 Discussion  Silicon wafers are usually sliced from cylindrical single-crystal ingots that have been ground toa uniform diameter prior to slicing.5.58 intrinsic, adj.  (1) the region in the conductivity-temperature curve where the conduction in a wafer isdominated by hole-electron pairs excited across the forbidden energy gap; (2) a process, such as intrinsic gettering,caused by factors within the crystal of the wafer itself.5.59 laser light-scattering event  a signal pulse that exceeds a preset threshold, generated by the interaction of alaser beam with a discrete scatterer at a wafer surface as sensed by a detector; see also haze.5.59.1 Discussion  In a scanning surface inspection system, the background signal due to haze and laser light-scattering events together comprise the signal due to light-scattering from a wafer surface.5.60 lay  the predominant direction of the surface texture.5.60.1 Discussion  Although the texture of polished silicon wafers is generally isotropic, some epitaxial wafersexhibit a pattern of steps and ledges when examined by atomic force microscopy at near atomic resolution.Contoured wafer edges may also exhibit lay even after polishing.5.61 light point defect, LPD  not preferred, use localized light-scatterer, LLS.5.61.1 Discussion  To some, the term light point defect implies a defective part; hence, a search was undertakenfor a more neutral term. Several were tried, and finally, despite some objection to the difficulty of saying the code,the term localized light scatterer was approved as a replacement. This term is general in nature and can refer tofeatures detected both visual inspection and by automated inspection using a scanning surface inspection system.5.62 lineage  a low-angle grain boundary resulting from an array of dislocations.5.63 localized light-scatterer, LLS  an isolated feature, such as a particle or a pit, on or in a wafer surface,resulting in increased light-scattering intensity relative to that of the surrounding wafer surface; sometimes calledlight point defect.5.63.1 Discussion  Localized light scatterers of sufficient size appear as points of light under high intensity opticalillumination; these points of light can be observed visually, but the observation is a qualitative one. Localized lightscatterers are observed by automated inspection techniques as laser-light scattering events. Automated inspectiontechniques are quantitative in the sense that scatterers with different scattering intensities can be segregated. Thepresence of LLSs does not necessarily decrease the utility of the wafer.

Particles areobserved by automated inspection as laser light-scattering events, but they may also be observed visually under highintensity illumination as points of light or studied by other methods, including scanning electron microscopy.Particles on wafer surfaces can usually be removed by non-etching cleaning.5.79 pit  a depression in a wafer surface where sloped sides of the depression meet the surface in adistinguishable manner in contrast to the sides of a dimple, which are rounded.

Front surface or back surface reference planes should be selected depending onthe wafer mounting system. If the wafer cannot be gimbaled in the imaging system, a back surface reference planeshould be specified. For shape measurement, the reference plane to be used is spelled out in the applicable testmethod.5.85 reference plane deviation, RPD  the distance perpendicular to the reference plane between the referenceplane and the wafer surface being measured.5.86 resistivity, (electrical),, \[Ωcm\]  the measure of difficulty with which charged carriers flow through amaterial; the reciprocal of conductivity.5.86.1 Discussion  the resistivity of a semiconductor or other material is the ratio of the potential gradient (electricfield) parallel with the current to the current density.5.87 rms area microroughness, R qA  the root mean square of the topographic deviations of a surface Z(x,y) fromthe mean surface taken within the (rectangular) evaluation area Ae = L x L y.5.87.1 Discussion  The rms area microroughness is one of several statistical metrics that can be used to describesurface topography; definitions for other metrics and for such concepts as mean surface and evaluation area may befound in ANSI/ASME B46.1 and ISO 4287/1.5.87.2 The function RqA is related to a two-dimensional measurement of the surface profile as follows:2/1 0 02 dd),(1  =  x yL L eqA yxyxZAR (1) The digital approximation of RqA for a surface profile consisting of N by M data points equally spaced along the xand y directions, respectively, is:2/1 1 121   = = = M i N jijqA ZNMR (2) 5.87.3 Experimentally, the profile is always limited by the spatial bandwidth of the measurement. In the x direction,the profile length is L x divided into N equally spaced points; the lower spatial frequency limit for fx can never be lessthan 1/L x and the upper spatial frequency limit can never be greater than the Nyquist limit, N/2L x. Similarly, in the ydirection, the profile length is L y divided into M equally spaced points; the lower frequency limit for fy can never beless than 1/L y and the upper spatial frequency limit can never be greater than the Nyquist limit, M/2L y. Practicallimits to the spatial bandwidth are governed by considerations similar to those for the one-dimensional case (see5.88.4).

SEMI M59-0305 © SEMI 2005 10 5.87.4 RqA can also be estimated by integrating the two-dimensional power spectral density (PSD) function, PSD(fx ,fy), over the spatial frequency range between spatial frequencies that lie within the bandwidth of the measurement:2/12 1 2 1dd),(   =  x x y y f f f fyxyxAqA ffffPSDR (3) 5.87.5 If the surface is assumed to be isotropic and the instrument response function is neglected, the rmsmicroroughness over the spatial frequency range between f1 and f2 can also be obtained by integrating the isotropicPSD function:2/12 1d)(   = f fisoqA ffPSDR (4) where: 2/122 2 0 )( and),,(2 d),()( yx yxA yxAiso fff ffPSDf fffPSDfPSD += = =    5.88 rms microroughness, Rq  the root mean square of the surface profile height deviations Z(x) from the meanline taken within the evaluation length L.5.88.1 Discussion  Rq is one of several statistical metrics that can be used to describe a surface profile; definitionsfor other metrics and for such concepts as mean line, evaluation length, and power spectral density function, may befound in ANSI/ASME B46.1 and ISO 4287/1.5.88.2 The function Rq is related to a one-dimensional measurement of the surface profile as follows:2/1 02 d)(1 = Lq xxZLR (5) 5.88.3 The digital approximation of Rq for a profile consisting of N equally spaced points is:2/1 121 = =Ni iq ZNR (6) 5.88.4 Experimentally, the profile is always limited by the spatial bandwidth of the measurement. For a profile oflength L, consisting of N equally spaced points, the lower spatial frequency limit f1 can never be less than 1/L andthe upper spatial frequency limit f2 can never be greater than the Nyquist limit, N/2L. In practical cases, f1  2/L; theachievable value of f2 depends on instrumental parameters.5.88.5 Rq can also be estimated by integrating the one-dimensional power spectral density (PSD) function, PSD(f),over the spatial frequency range between two spatial frequencies, f1 and f2, that lie within the bandwidth of themeasurement:2/12 1d)(   = f fq ffPSDR (7) 5.88.6 In all cases, Rq must be reported together with the lower and upper limits, f1 and f2, respectively, of the spatialfrequency bandwidth over which it has been determined. Alternatively, the spatial bandwidth may be expressed interms of the upper and lower spatial wavelengths,  2 (= 1/f2) and  1 (= 1/f1), respectively.5.89 roughness  the more narrowly spaced components of surface texture.

The reference plane is calculated using all points within the subsite that fall within the FQA.5.91.2 Precise scanner site flatness measurement requires measurement points located closely enough to reveal thesurface topography in detail.

SEMI M60-0305 © SEMI 20051 SEMI M60-0305TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWNCHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION This test method was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the Japanese Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the Japanese RegionalStandards Committee on January 11, 2005. Initially available at www.semi.org January 2005; to bepublished March 2005. 1 Purpose1.1 The technique outlined in this test method is for the purpose of standardizing silicon wafer characterization byGOI (Gate Oxide Integrity). For more detailed discussion of the general characterizing methods for this test, thereader is referred to 3. TZDB technique as SEMI M51 is advantageous to estimate failure rate by intrinsicbreakdown as the C mode and an accidental breakdown as the B mode. However, this test method has a highersensitivity for detecting the accidental breakdown mode than TZDB. 2 Scope2.1 This test method is for the purpose of the characterization method of silicon wafer by GOI. Thischaracterization method is outlined below2.1.1 MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor)  capacitor fabrication  A gate oxide film is thermally grown on asilicon wafer surface. Then, poly-Si electrodes are formed on the gate oxide film. Other metals, other than poly-silicon electrode materials, can be used, however, it shall be desirable to use an electrode that has been confirmed tohave sufficiently good characteristics for application as a gate electrode as described below.2.1.2 Electrical Characterization Evaluation  The TDDB (Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown) characteristicsof the MOS capacitors are measured. The presence of COPs (Crystal Originated Particles) at the surface of thepolished Si substrates influences the TDDB characteristics of the gate oxide. That is, the silicon wafer is evaluatedin terms of the TDDB characteristics of the gate oxide. The test method outlined in this test method is for thepurpose of standardizing the procedure of MOS fabrication, measurement, analyses, and the report of the GOI datato interested parties. This test method is based on the results of round robin among the silicon wafer manufacturers.In general, GOI strongly depends on crystal defects, contaminations and particles on/near wafer surface. GOI alsodepends on the fabrication environment. The cleanliness of the process environment in which the MOS capacitorsare fabricated shall be evaluated to be acceptable (see 5.3).2.2 The target of this test method is to characterize silicon wafers, that is, evaluate COPs near the silicon wafersurface. The proper gate oxide thickness of the MOS samples is 2025 nm. A discussion on gate oxide thickness isgiven in a later section. Oxygen precipitates are also one of the gate oxide defect origins, however, this is beyondthe scope of this test method because the as-received wafers contain only a small amount of oxygen precipitates.Near-surface quality can be evaluated in this test. In this case, it is assumed that an oxide film thickness ofapproximately 10 nm is used. It is more difficult to categorize the accidental and intrinsic breakdowns in TZDB, asthe gate oxide thickness becomes thinner. Therefore mode classification in TDDB is more effective.2.3 For detailed discussion on sample structures used in this test method, the reader shall refer to EIA/JEDECStandard 35-1. In general, the most likely sample structures are a simple planar MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor)capacitor structure, various isolation structures (for example, LOCOS (LOCal Oxidation of Silicon), STI (ShallowTrench Isolation)), and FET (Field-Effect Transistor) structures. For the purpose of silicon wafer characterization,the simple planar MOS capacitor structure is the most desirable. In the case of the various isolation and FETstructures, the silicon wafer receives thermal treatments several times in the complicated sample fabrication process.Therefore, in this case it is questionable whether the characteristics of the starting Si wafer are reflected in this testmeasurement results.2.4 In this evaluation method, a constant current stress is applied to the gate oxide and time to breakdown ismeasured. The amount of charge injected until dielectric breakdown (Q bd) is also calculated. (Constant-currentTDDB: detail of measurement condition is described in a later section). The dielectric breakdown by the COPs andother defects can be evaluated from the accumulated failure distribution of Qbd. In addition, a constant-voltage

&lt;!-- Page 34 --&gt;

SEMI M60-0305 © SEMI 2005 2 TDDB method can be used as an evaluation of gate oxide lifetime. In this test method, the constant-current TDDBmethod is chosen, because the constant current TDDB method has less influence on parasitic resistance in ameasurement circuit than the constant-voltage TDDB method.2.5 This test method gives instructions for the procedure for characterizing mirror-polished, p-type CZ siliconwafers. Gate electrodes were negatively biased so that the silicon surface is in accumulation. Stress current shall besufficient for the gate oxide to be broken down within a finite measurement time. In addition, it is desirable to havean applied current density J within 0.01 and 0.1A/cm2.2.6 The stress gate current has to be reversed for the n-type silicon wafer.2.7 The poly-silicon film is used as gate electrode of measured MOS capacitors. The poly-silicon film can makestandard test results applicable to the testing of wafers used to fabricate integrated circuits rather than other metalelectrodes because poly-silicon electrodes are commonly used in actual devices. However, a gate electrode otherthan poly-silicon gate electrode shall be studied for applications in advanced ultralarge-scale integrated circuits. Inthis case, the new electrode material shall have the same detection sensitivity to silicon wafer defects as poly-siliconelectrode.NOTICE: This test method does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.

SEMI M60-0305 © SEMI 2005 4 Figure 1Classification in Weibull plot of TDDB result. 4.2.3.2.1 Discussion on failure modes: A-A Mode: Initial breakdown failureo This failure is caused by defects generated during gate oxide formation process such as pinholes and alsoby crystal defects such as COPs. This failure corresponds to the A mode and partly B mode failures ofTZDB. A-B Mode: Intermediate breakdown failureo This failure is caused by extrinsic defects which are not serious enough to cause the A-A mode. Thisfailure corresponds to the B mode and partly C mode failure of TZDB. W Mode: Wearout breakdowno This breakdown is also called intrinsic breakdown or fatigue breakdown, and relates to the intrinsic lifetimeof oxide films. The measurement of this breakdown shall be performed carefully because the resultdepends on measurement conditions.o Response rapidity of the measurement system has a great influence on A-A mode detection. The totalnumber of A-A and A-B mode failures is related to the crystal quality of the mirror-polished CZ Si wafers.4.2.3.3 Categorization of Breakdown Modes  boundaries of A-A/A-B modes and A-B/W modes shall be definedin advance.4.2.3.3.1 A-A/A-B Mode Boundary The detectable minimum Q bd values depend on the stress current and response speed of the measurementsystems. As stress current density increases, the charge density of the A-A/A-B mode boundary may alsoincreases. This effect shall be considered when defining the A-A/A-B mode boundary. Based on these roundrobin results, the charge density range from 0.0001C/cm2 to 0.01 C/cm2 is recommended as the A-A/A-B modeboundary.4.2.3.3.2 A-B/W mode boundary The A-B/W mode boundary is defined in terms of Weibull plots as shown in Figure RI-3. Ideally, it shall bedetermined by the intercept point of two approximation lines in the A-B and W mode ranges. If the boundarycharge density is too low (Q &lt; 1 C/cm2), one part of the A-B mode breakdown can be counted as the W mode.Otherwise, if the boundary charge density is too high (Q &gt; 4 C/cm2), one part of the W mode breakdown can becounted as the A-B mode. In both cases, we have errors in the classification of the failure mode categories, even if the measurement isaccurately carried out and appropriate Weibull plots are obtained. So, the results of this round robin indicatethat the charge density of 2 C/cm2 is recommended as the A-B/W mode boundary. To measure the failure ratesat the boundary charge density of the A-B/W modes, all samples are not necessarily broken down. If thedetermination procedure of the boundary charge density is clear, the application of a predetermined charge

&lt;!-- Page 37 --&gt;

SEMI M60-0305 © SEMI 20055 density will give us the approximate failure rate by the A-B mode breakdown. It is necessary to determine theclassification of failure modes in advance. This is because reliabilities depend on the devices fabricated on theSi wafer (electrode material, gate oxide thickness, operating voltage, etc.). Refer to an example of modeclassification described in Figure RI-2.4.2.3.4 Time Zero Dielectric Breakdown (TZDB)  one of the dielectric breakdown characteristic of the gate oxide.4.2.3.4.1 Discussion  To measure TZDB, oxide leakage current is monitored with an electric field applied to theMOS capacitor stepwise from 0 to 15MV/cm (for example in the case of a 25 nm-thick oxide, actual applied voltagewould be from 0 to 37.5V). The electrode is negatively biased so that the Si surface is in accumulation and theelectric field is applied effectively. Applied electric field (or voltage) is measured when the oxide leakage currentreaches a predetermined value (judgment current), in other words when the gate oxide breaks down. The influenceof COPs on gate oxide breakdown can be estimated from the distribution of breakdown electric field. 5 Summary of Method5.1 Overview  This test method consists of two parts. The first one is the fabrication of a number of similar MOScapacitors on silicon wafers, and the second one is the measurement of the electric charge injected just before thedielectric breakdown of the MOS capacitors. To measure the injected electric charge, the voltage applied to a MOScapacitor is controlled so that the current is kept constant. The voltage is monitored throughout the test, and the timefrom the beginning to a sudden voltage drop which results from the dielectric breakdown of the silicon dioxide filmis measured. The injected electric charge is the product of the measured time and the gate current density.5.2 MOS Capacitor Fabrication Process  Many MOS capacitors are formed on the test wafer. The MOSfabrication process consists of wafer cleaning, thermal oxidation, poly-Si deposition, phosphorous doping, activationheat treatment, photolithography and etching, in the case of using poly-Si electrodes. The details of the MOScapacitor fabrication process are shown in SEMI M51. When materials other than poly-silicon are used forelectrodes, the process shall be adjusted to the material used. Although thermally grown 2025 nm-thick gate oxidefilms are recommended in SEMI M51, oxide films as thin as 10 nm can be used depending on the situation.However, measurement shall be performed carefully for oxide films thinner than 3 nm, because breakdownjudgment becomes difficult under the influence of direct tunneling current. See SEMI C3.6, SEMI C3.54, SEMIC21, SEMI C27, SEMI C28, SEMI C30, SEMI C35, SEMI C38, SEMI C41, SEMI C44, SEMI C54, SEMI C59.5.3 Fabrication Environment  It is necessary to fabricate MOS capacitors in a clean room environment of 1000 orbetter class in total quality. That is, it needs to be confirmed that the A mode failure rate is 10% or less by TZDBevaluation. The A mode failure depends not only on the particle of work environment atmosphere but also on theultrapure water, fixtures, process apparatus, clean clothes, operation rules etc. Heavily contamination such asalkaline or heavy metal has an important negative effect on the GOI of the oxide.5.4 Measurement of Electric Characteristic of MOS Capacitors5.4.1 The dielectric breakdown defect density of the silicon oxide film is evaluated by constant current TDDBmeasurement of the MOS capacitors. The evaluation consists of the measurement of charge injected before thedielectric breakdown of the MOS capacitors. To measure the injected charge, voltage applied to a MOS capacitor iscontrolled so that the current is kept constant. The applied voltage is monitored throughout the test, and the time tosudden voltage drop which results from dielectric breakdown of the silicon dioxide film is measured. The amount ofthe injected charge is the product of the measured time and gate current density. The defect density of the oxidefilm is evaluated from the Weibull plot (cumulative failure rate) of the dielectric breakdown data of approximately100 MOS capacitors.

SEMI M60-0305 © SEMI 2005 6 5.4.2 Stress Current Density  For reliable measurement, a voltage/current source with a stable output wave shapeshall be used. It is necessary to stabilize the output as much as possible. In the constant current TDDBmeasurement, a constant current is continuously applied, and voltage is monitored. The dielectric breakdown isjudged by a sudden drop in the voltage monitored. If the applied stress current density is too low, the time tobreakdown will be too long to be realistic. Contrarily, too a high current density is also unsuitable because thevoltage drop in the oxide breakdown instant becomes small. Considering these factors, the recommended stresscurrent density range is from 0.01 to 0.1A/cm2.5.5 Measurement Temperature  Besides current density, the measurement temperature is also an importantparameter which determines measurement time. It is appropriate to measure in the temperature range of roomtemperature to 150C, taking into consideration the temperature tolerance of the measurement equipment. Inaddition, there are cases that since silicon wafer, stage chuck, probe, and so on, expand at a high temperature, theprobe deviates from the predetermined position, thus consideration is required when selecting probing machines.5.6 Breakdown Judgment  To measure the dielectric breakdown lifetime of an oxide film, the voltage applied to aMOS capacitor is controlled so that a current is kept constant. The applied voltage is monitored throughout the test.The dielectric breakdown of the oxide is judged by sudden voltage drop. In practice, at the dielectric breakdown theapplied voltage becomes lower than the criterion voltage defined before. The dielectric breakdown lifetime is thestress application time till breakdown. If the criterion voltage is too low, it can easily affected by noise. In contrast,the chance of missing breakdown events is increased if the criterion voltage is too high. The changes in twocontinuous measured gate voltages can be used to judge the oxide breakdown. The instant at which the voltagechange became larger than the criterion value is defined as dielectric breakdown. The same caution mentionedabove is also required in this case. In this round robin, the current density is from 0.01 to 0.1A/cm2 , the sheetresistance of the poly-silicon electrode is approximately 50 ohm/sq, gate electrode area is from 1mm2 to 10mm2,gate oxide thickness is 25nm and measurement temperature is from room temperature to 150C. In this casedielectric breakdown is determined from the changes in two continuous measured gate voltages. For example, thechange in gate voltage is larger than X criterion(%) of the former gate voltage value. Xcriterion is higher than 10%.Alternatively, dielectric breakdown is determined with the measured electric field, Eox. It is considered thatdielectric breakdown does not happen until E ox becomes Ecriterion or lower. Ecriterion is higher than 4MV/cm. Stablemeasurement results are obtained in both cases. Of course, these criterion electric fields depend on gate oxidethickness, sheet resistance and area of gate electrode, stress current, stress temperature, and so on. To detect thedielectric breakdown with the change in gate voltage as shown in Figure 2, it is desirable to determine the criterionunder each condition in advance.5.7 Estimation of Accidental Failure Rate  As mentioned before, the total number of A-A and A-B mode failuresis related to the crystal quality of the mirror polished CZ Si wafers. It takes a long time to measure the wearoutlifetime of all the MOS capacitors. If a requirement is only measurement of the accidental failure rates of the MOScapacitors on silicon wafer surface, TDDB measurement can be finished without detecting the wearout lifetimes.That is, maximum stress time, Tmax, is determined to be Qbd in the A-B mode range in advance. The cumulativefailure rate at Tmax is the total failure rate of the A-A and A-B modes. If the rough shapes of the Weibull plots of theTDDB measurement can be predicted in advance, Tmax shall be determined as to be the maximum Q bd in therelatively flat range of the A-B mode. This reason is that variation of Tmax has little influence on the evaluation oftotal accidental failure rates. This method has an advantage of that the failure rate of the A-A and A-B modes isevaluated very quickly.5.8 Constant-Voltage TDDB  The constant-voltage TDDB method is also used for a lifetime test. Measurementconditions shall be optimized for each purpose. For TDDB, an average electric field of approximately 10MV/cm isrequired. Therefore, the effective electric field applied to an oxide film is influenced by a series resistance. Thus,the constant current TDDB is more suitable.

The MOS capacitors shall beformed in accordance with the fabrication processes described in 5 and SEMI M51. This reason is because theoxide characteristics depend on the fabrication processes. If MOS capacitors would be formed with differentfabrication processes, it is desirable to confirm that these GOI results are similar to those of the MOS capacitorsformed by the fabrication processes described above. Particularly, the electrode material of the MOS capacitors hasa great influence on the dielectric breakdown of the gate oxide. Poly-silicon is specified as the electrode material inthis standard. The test with the poly-silicon gate electrode gives us the test results directly applicable to the wafersfor the integrated circuits rather than other metal electrodes, because poly-silicon electrodes are commonly used inactual devices. Of course other materials are also available for electrodes. Where other electrode material is used,an appropriate method for each case and the correlation data between poly-silicon and the other material shall beprepared.6.2 It is well known that both the silicon surface morphology and the cross-sectional structure at the pattern edge ofthe active region of the MOS devices influence the dielectric breakdown of the gate oxide. Various types ofcontaminants also influence the dielectric breakdown of the gate oxide. The extent of contamination by alkalinemetals, heavy metals or organic particles increases, as the sample fabrication process progresses.6.2.1 The electrode area and total number of MOS capacitors shall be chosen to be suitable for the purpose of thetest. The suitable gate area for the constant current TDDB measurement depends on the applied stress (i.e. inducedcurrent). If the gate electrode area is too large, parasitic resistance of the gate electrode disturbs uniform applicationof stress current to gate oxide. That is, too a high current density leads to nonuniform stress on gate oxide. As aresult, the reliability of the measurement is reduced. The gate oxide with a defect density is able to be evaluatedusing two sets of MOS capacitors. Although the gate area and total number of MOS capacitors have the sameproduct, one set consists of many capacitors with a small gate area and the other set consists of a few of capacitorswith a large gate area. The TDDB evaluations using the former are more desirable than those using the latter. Inthis round robin, where a polycrystalline silicon thickness is 300 nm, sheet resistance is 50Ω/ and gate area issmaller than 5 mm2, reasonable TDDB results were obtained. 7 Interferences7.1 Since this is a DC measurement, care must be taken to make sure that the silicon wafer has a low-resistanceohmic contact. There must be no dielectric film on the back surface, e.g., silicon oxide, in order to effectively applya voltage bias to the gate oxide. It is not necessary for this to be carried out with a metallic contact on the backsurface of the wafer under test. However, when the vacuum chucking is weak, care must be taken because of thepossibility that the dielectric breakdown of the gate oxide is not accurately judged due to an increase in parasiticresistance. It is strongly suggested that testing be carried out with a current polarity such that the silicon surface willbe in accumulation below the gate oxide, that is, negative voltages for p-type silicon wafers. If the polarity of thevoltage is chosen to be in the reverse direction, the breakdown voltage may not be accurately measured due to thepresence of a depletion layer below the gate oxide. Controls of electrical noise in this test method are crucial to the

SEMI M60-0305 © SEMI 2005 8 proper identification of the failure criteria. It is possible that rapid voltage changes at the dielectric breakdown ofthe gate oxide cause electrical noise. There is a possibility that this noise leads to misjudgments of the oxidebreakdown. So it is desirable to confirm that oxide breakdown occurred. For example after the TDDBmeasurement has been completed, the samples are measured to confirm their insulation. Mechanical stress due tothe exploring probe can influence the measurement results, because the exploring probe is in contact with the gateelectrode directly on the gate oxide. The actual results obtained depend somewhat on the sample fabricationprocess. Care must be taken to ensure consistent processing. Wafer temperature during testing shall be clearlydefined. Large temperature variations might have an impact on results.7.1.1 Precaution  Since the voltages and currents involved are potentially dangerous, appropriate means ofpreventing the operator from coming into contact with the exploring probe or other charge surfaces shall be in placebefore testing. This standard does not include any clauses relating to the safety and sanitation of the environment.Those who intend to implement this standard shall consider appropriate means to prevent any accidents or disasters,as well as taking responsibility for maintaining a state of safety, health and hygiene for users. 8 Sampling8.1 Sampling is the responsibility of the user of this test method. However, if testing is carried out as part of acomparison or a correlation, all participants shall agree upon sampling in advance.NOTE 3: Refer to the appendix of JEDEC standard No.35 for good discussion of sampling plan statistics. 9 Apparatus9.1 SEMI M51 and SEMI M1771 shall be applied for measurement equipment such as current/voltage source unitsand manual probing machines 10 Procedure10.1 Fabrication of MOS Capacitors10.1.1 Refer to SEMI M51, introducing poly-silicon as an electrode material. Where another electrode material isused, an appropriate method for each case and the correlation data between poly-silicon and the other material shallbe prepared.10.2 Measurement10.2.1 Before measurement, record the following information for each sample: date, time, operator, sample ID,oxide thickness, gate area, gate material, oxidation condition, conductivity type (p or n), equipment ID, andcomments.10.2.2 Decide on measurement parameters and record them. Constant current is applied in this test method. Theparameters include stress current density (J), measurement interval (Tint), maximum stress time (Tmax), gate area (S),judgment voltage of breakdown (V bd), measurement temperature, the number of capacitors to be measured and amap of the capacitors.10.2.3 Set a tungsten exploring probe at the starting position.10.2.4 Set the exploring probe on a new MOS capacitor at the next position.10.2.5 Set the accumulated time to zero (T (0) = 0). Record the oxide leakage current and the voltage.10.2.6 Set the stress current to the designated point. Monitor the time (t) and the voltage (Vt) from the start.10.2.7 If the applied time is equal to or greater than the maximum stress time(t ≥ Tmax), record the maximum stresstime (Tmax) as the breakdown time (Tbd) along with the MOS address, and proceed to 10.2.8. If t is less than Tmax,proceed to the next step.10.2.8 Check to see if the voltage Vt has reached the judgment voltage of breakdown (Vbd). If so, record the time(t), along with each MOS address, as the breakdown time (Tbd), stop applying the stress current, and proceed to10.2.9. If not, repeat from 10.2.6.

The flatband voltage shift is due to gate-substrate work functiondifference\[ms\] and oxide fixed charge\[Qf \]. Although it is better to consider this flatband voltage shift, its influenceon the oxide film thickness in the range recommended in this test method is small.11.4 Calculation of Defect Density11.4.1 Calculate the defect density using the following equation based on the Poisson distribution assumption of thedielectric breakdown defects (see Standard EIA/JEDEC 35):ox =  ln (1  F) / S (5)Hereox = Defect density (defects/cm2) ,F = Failure fraction for each oxide breakdown mode ,and S = Capacitor gate area (cm2).Example: Given a total of 100 MOS capacitors tested, with 30 accidental-mode-failed capacitors and a gate area of10 mm2 , the defect density would be as follows:ox =  ln ( 1  ( 30 / 100 ) ) / 0.1= 3.6 defects/cm2 (6)

SEMI M60-0305 © SEMI 2005 14 RELATED INFORMATION 1OUTLINE OF ROUND ROBIN NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI M60 and was derived from the GOI Task Force.This round robin was conducted among Shin-Etsu Handotai Co., Ltd., Komatsu Electronic Metals Co., Ltd.,Toshiba Ceramics Co., Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsubishi Silicon Corporation and MEMC Japan Ltd. R1-1 MOS StructureR1-1.1 Gate Oxide ThicknessR1-1.1.1 In this round robin, we evaluated the constant current TDDB (TDDB) of MOS capacitors with a gateoxide film thickness of 25 nm on mirror-polished, p-type, CZ silicon wafers. In the TDDB evaluation, a negativeconstant current was applied, and T bd was measured. R1-2 Correlation between TZDB and TDDBR1-2.1 Correlation Between TZDB and TDDBR1-2.1.1 A correlation between TZDB and TDDB is shown in Figure RI-1. This result is based on round robin.This figure is shown by defect densities of the TZDB and TDDB measurements. The defect densities of TDDB aregenerally higher than those of TZDB. This result is shown that the sensitivity to dielectric breakdown defect ofTDDB measurement is higher than that of TZDB measurement. R1-3 Classification of Breakdown modeR1-3.1 In Figure RI-2, a typical cumulative failure fraction is shown as a function of charge injected beforebreakdown. Such a plot is called the TDDB Weibull plot. In the Weibull plot of the TDDB result, the breakdownevents are categorized into the following three modes.R1-3.2 A-A Mode  Initial Breakdown FailureR1-3.2.1 Integrity of the oxide films in this mode is very low. There are COPs or oxygen precipitates other thanparticles, alkaline and metallic contamination at the Si surface of the MOS capacitors in this category. Classificationof this mode with the following A-B mode is performed at a small amount of injected charge, Qa , as illustrated inFig RI-2. For example, the classification charge, Qa , was 0.01C/cm2 in this round robin. This failure is caused bydefects generated during formation of the gate oxide such as pinholes and also by crystal defects such as COPs.That is, this failure corresponds to the A mode and partial B mode failure of TZDB.R1-3.3 A-B Mode  Intermediate Breakdown FailureR1-3.3.1 This failure occurs in the intermediate time range from initial breakdown failure to wearout breakdown.This failure is caused by extrinsic defects. This failure corresponds to the B mode and partial C-mode failure ofTZDB.R1-3.4 W Mode  Wearout BreakdownR1-3.4.1 This breakdown is also called intrinsic breakdown or wearout breakdown, and related to the intrinsiclifetime of oxide films. The failure fraction steeply increases as shown in Figure R1-2. The measurement of thisbreakdown should be performed carefully because the result depends on measurement conditions.R1-3.4.2 Classification of the accidental and wearout modes, that is, the A-B and W modes, is far from easybecause the W mode gradually shifts toward the A-B mode as shown in Figures R1-3, R1-5 and R1-6. It isstatistically supported that the Weibull plot is straight in the W mode region. The regression straight line has thecorrelation coefficient higher than 0.9 with the experimental data. When the A-B mode breakdown events are addedto the breakdown data, a correlation coefficient of the data and its straight line approximation decreases. Thischaracteristic to determine the classification of the accidental and wearout modes can be used. In this round robin,the classification of the injected charge density, Qw , was determined as follows. A regression straight line in theinjected charge density range of higher than Qw was obtained by the least square method. The recommendedcorrelation coefficient is higher than 0.95. Qw is 2C/cm2 in Figure R1-4. In a different manner, the cross point oftwo regression straight lines in the A-B and W mode breakdown ranges was read as Qw .

SEMI M60-0305 © SEMI 200515 R1-4 Dependence of Stress Current DensityR1-4.1 In this TDDB measurement, the stress electric field was applied so as to keep the oxide leakage currentconstant. The applied voltage was monitored at the constant time interval. A stress current of 0.001 A/cm2 or lessleads to uselessly long measurement time.R1-4.2 On the other hand, too high a current density leads to nonuniform application of the stress voltage to thegate oxide. That is, the reliability of the measurement is reduced.R1-4.3 In this round robin, the applied stress condition is shown in Table R1-1.R1-4.4 The Weibull plot obtained in this round robin is shown in Figure R1-5. The Q bd values and the accidentalfailure rates are shown in Table R1-2. The Qbd clearly depended on the stress current in the stress range of thisround robin. The Q bd decreased with increasing stress current density, though the difference of the failure rates isslight. The failure rates in this result were defined by the sum of the accidental initial and intermediate modes inFigure R1-2. The classification between intermediate (A-B mode) and wearout (W mode) breakdowns wasperformed at the injected charge density of 2C/cm2.R1-4.5 The total accidental failure rates, that is, the sum of the A-A and A-B modes, were not influenced by thecurrent density in this round robin condition. Therefore, the recommended stress current density range is from 0.1 to0.01A/cm2 . R1-5 Dependence of Measurement TemperatureR1-5.1 On the other hand, in this TDDB measurement, the stress temperature is an important parameter. The Q bddepended on the stress temperature. Too high a temperature degrades the measurement system. In the stresstemperature range of room temperature to 125C, systematic TDDB data were obtained. The recommended stresstemperature is 125C or less.R1-5.2 The stress conditions in this round robin are shown in Table R1-1. In this table, the accidental failure ratewas defined by the sum of the initial and intermediate breakdowns in Figure R1-2. In this case, the classifications ofthe A-B and W modes were defined as follows:125C2C/cm2 85C5C/cm2 25C (r.t.)10C/cm2 R1-5.3 The Q bd depended on the stress temperature in this round robin condition. However, the sum of theaccidental A-A and A-B breakdown modes was independent of stress temperature. Therefore, taking intoconsideration the above practical factors, the reasonable stress temperature range is from room temperature to125C.
