This\nsection provides a description of how these services may be applied for RMS.\nR1-6.1    Scope  \xf3  Scope  may  be  used  to  specify  the  namespace  of  interest.  It  may  also  be  used  to  specify  a\nnamespace or recipe execution resource belonging to a component agent of the service provider. For example, scope\nallows a factory host to ask a cluster tool for the attributes of a cluster module.\nScope may be used to point to one of several namespaces supported by an agent.\nR1-6.2  Filter \xf3 A filter may be used when asking a namespace for a list of recipe identifiers to limit the number of\nidentifiers  returned.  For  example,  the  service  user  may  ask  a  namespace  for  a  list  of  recipe  identifiers  that  were\nedited  by  \xecTom\xee  (Attribute  name  =  \xecEditedBy\xee,  Attribute  value  =  \xecTom\xee,  Attribute  Relation  =  \xecis  equal  to\xee)  and\nthat are linked (Attribute name = \xecLinked\xee, Attribute value = \xecTRUE\xee, Attribute Relation = \xecis equal to\xee).\nR1-6.3  Complex Attributes \xf3 Object Services do not provide a way to change individual elements in an attribute\nwith  a  structure  or  list  form.  To  add,  delete,  or  modify  items  in  a  list  or  structure,  it  is  necessary  to  first  get  the\ncurrent attribute value for the object of interest using the GetAttr service, to make the desired changes externally to\nthe value, and then to write the new value using the SetAttr service.\nR1-7  Examples of RMS Application\nFigure  R1-2  illustrates  possible  interactions  between  a  namespace  and  namespace  manager  implemented  on  a\nfactory system, a diskless equipment with a recipe executor, and an operator."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"Figure R1-2\nExample of RMS Applications"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E42-0704 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2004 121\nOther  examples  would  be  similar.

This section contains guidelines and examples for maintaining recipe attributes within the\nbody of a Stream 7 process program.\nR1-1.1  Recipe Identifier \u2014 Both the process program identifier PPID and the object identifier, including the recipe\nidentifier, have a maximum length of 80 characters. Recipe class, name, and version number may be encoded into\nthe data item PPID using the format required for the recipe identifier.\n\xec/CLASS\n1\n/CLASS\n2\n/.../CLASS\nn\n/NAME;VERSION\xee\nIt is recommended that recipe class names be unique, allowing use of the form\n\xec/CLASS/NAME;VERSION\xee\nto ensure the length conforms to the maximum allowed in SECS-II.\nR1-1.2  Recipe Sections \u2014 All sections of the recipe are transferred together as the data item PPBODY. This allows\nall non-default values of recipe attributes to be preserved when a recipe is uploaded to the host and later downloaded\nback to equipment.\nThere are two potential methods for formatting PPBODY. If the recipe body is a text file, it is recommended that all\nattribute values are translated into text, including numeric and boolean values, with boolean values represented by\nthe  strings  \xec.T.\xee  or  \xec.F.\xee.  The  second  recommended  method,  applicable  to  both  source  and  object  forms,  uses  the\nstructure  of  one  of  the  SECS-II  messages  containing  the  managed  recipe,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  1,  or  of  an\nexecution  recipe.  A  cluster  tool  supporting  shared  namespaces,  for  example,  might  require  multiple  agent-specific\ndata sets, while single-process equipment types would not.\nR1-1.2.1    Structuring  PPBODY  Using  Text \u2014  For  purposes  of  transfer,  recipes  are  regarded  as  composed  of\nsections:  The  generic  section,  the  body  section,  and  zero  or  more  agent-specific  data-set  sections  (RMS,  Section\n12. 1). This convention should also be maintained within PPBODY. The SECS-II messages used to transfer recipes\n(Stream 15, Functions 15 and 18) transfer the data-set sections last, because they are variable in number and are not\nalways present. However, in a text format within PPBODY, it is generally easier to put all attributes before the body.\nSince RMS uses the end-of-line character for source form recipes, this convention is recommended to separate the\nlogical components of the sections containing attributes as well. A few reserved keywords are sufficient as tags to\nidentify   significant   components:   SECTION,   ATTRIBUTE,   LIST,   PARAMNAME,   PARAMSETTING,   and\nPARAMRULE  are  recommended  for  consistency.  Keywords  are  in  uppercase  for  visual  impact  and  are  not\ndelimited except for use of whitespace and the line-feed character (0A\n16\n) used as the end-of-line (eol) character.\nWhitespace is used to separate fields within a line. The symbol \uf8f0\uf8fb is used here to represent whitespace, which is used\nboth as a delimiter to separate fields within a line and also for optional visual effect.\nEach section begins with a section declaration of the form\nSECTION\uf8f0\uf8fb\xeetext\xee(eol)\nwhere  text  is  a  section  name,  one  of  \xecGeneric\xee,  \xecASDS\xee,  \xecBody\xee.  Two  sections  are  separated  with  two  eol\ncharacters  together.  The  eol  convention  within  the  body  section,  however,  must  conform  to  the  recipe  language\nspecifications provided by the equipment manufacturer.\nEach attribute begins with\nATTRIBUTE\uf8f0\uf8fbAttributeName"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E42.1-0704 \xa9 SEMI 1996, 2004 6\nfollowed by the attribute value, which may be a single item, a list of single items, or a list of complex items, such as\nvariable  parameters.  If  a  list,  the  keyword  LIST  precedes  the  values,  each  item  in  the  list  terminated  with  either  a\ncomma or, for the last item, the eol character.\nThis becomes\nATTRIBUTE\uf8f0\uf8fbAttributeName\uf8f0\uf8fb \xectext\xee(eol)     (single-value attributes)\nor\nATTRIBUTE\uf8f0\uf8fbAttributeName\uf8f0\uf8fbLIST\uf8f0\uf8fb\xectext\xee,\uf020 \uf8f0\uf8fb\xectext\xee,...(eol)\nfor attributes consisting of lists of single items (e.g., LinkList or ExtRef).\nIf the keyword LIST if followed by eol, this indicates a list of complex items. The eol character, in this case, also is\nused to terminate the individual items in the high-order list. An attribute consisting of a list of complex items should\nidentify  the  individual  fields  of  each  complex  item.  Those  attributes  containing  variable  parameters  (e.g.,\nParameters) are of the form\nATTRIBUTE\uf8f0\uf8fbAttributeName\uf8f0\uf8fbLIST(eol)\n\uf8f0\uf8fbPARAMNAME\uf8f0\uf8fb\xectext\xee, \uf8f0\uf8fbPARAMSETTING\uf8f0\uf8fb\xectext\xee, \uf8f0\uf8fbPARAMRULE\uf8f0\uf8fb\xectext\xee(eol)\n\uf8f0\uf8fbPARAMNAME\uf8f0\uf8fb\xectext\xee, \uf8f0\uf8fbPARAMSETTING\uf8f0\uf8fb\xectext\xee, \uf8f0\uf8fbPARAMRULE\uf8f0\uf8fb\xectext\xee(eol)\n...\n\uf8f0\uf8fbPARAMNAME\uf8f0\uf8fb\xectext\xee, \uf8f0\uf8fbPARAMSETTING\uf8f0\uf8fb\xectext\xee, \uf8f0\uf8fbPARAMRULE\uf8f0\uf8fb\xectext\xee(eol)\nEach  individual  field  within  a  complex  attribute  value  is  delimited  with  the  quotation  mark  (\xec)  character.  The  eol\ncharacter is used to terminate a section declaration, an attribute declaration, and a complex item within an attribute.\nThe recipe body is preceded with\nSECTION       \xecBody\xee(eol)\nfollowed by the recipe body in the form normally used by the equipment.\nIn  comparison  of  the  two  suggested  formats,  the  advantage  of  the  text  form  described  in  this  section  is  that  the\nattributes  are  human-readable  and  printable  and  therefore  the  user  is  able  to  modify  those  attributes  that  are  not\ndesignated as read-only with a standard text editor.\nThe advantage of the SECS-II form (Figure 1) is that the equipment is more easily able to support a host that is only\ncapable of using Stream 7.\nR1-2  RMS-Compliant Recipe Management with Stream 7 Equipment\nFor  RMS-Compliant  Recipe  Management  applications  dealing  with  legacy  Stream  7  equipment,  the  situation  is\nmore restricted. While an RMS-compliant equipment may preserve attributes by bundling them inside the PPBODY\nof a process program, this option is not available when the situation is reversed because the equipment determines\nthe permissible format(s) within the recipe.

The  use  of  object  technology  for  ERS\nimplementations   is   not   required.   Further,   it   is   not\nrequired that ERS implementations be compliant to the\nObject  Services  Standard  (OSS).  This  standard  does\nspecifiy mechanisms by which ERS can take advantage\nof OSS when those services are provided.\n7. 1.1    Events  are  associated  with  an  object  and  data  is\nstored in object attributes. To uniquely identify an event\nor an attribute the object to which it relates must first be\nidentified.\n7. 1.2  An object may be a physical entity such as stand-\nalone  process  equipment,  a  cluster  tool  or  a  cluster\nmodule.  An  object  may  be  an  abstraction  such  as  a\nrecipe, a process job or a transfer job. An object may be\ndefined  by  the  equipment  supplier,  or  by  a  standard\nwith  which  the  equipment  complies.  An  example  of  a\ncluster tool, containing process modules, is used in this\nsection  as  the  service  provider.  This  example  is  for\nillustration purposes only. The same concepts apply for\nall factory objects as defined above.\n7. 1.3    Objects  may  be  part  of  an  object  hierarchy  or\ncontained  in  other  objects.  The  default  object  is  the\nobject  which  provides  the  service  connection.  In  the\ncase for batch processing equipment which is compliant\nto  GEM,  SEMI  E30,  the  connection  to  the  host  is\nprovided  by  the  equipment  and  the  equipment  is  the\ndefault  object.  Also,  a  cluster  controller  would  be  the\ndefault    object    of    equipment    containing    process\nmodules.  However,  from  the  point  of  view  of  the\ncluster   controller,   each   connection   to   the   service"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E53-0704 \xa9 SEMI 1996, 2004 5\nproviders   in   each   connected   module   would   be   the\ndefault     object.     For     example,     the     processing\nmanagement  service  of  PM:ETCH  would  be  a  default\nobject  for  that  module  connection.  But,  the  cluster\ncontroller would have differernt default objects on each\nof its other service connections.\n7. 1.4  An object specifier, (see SEMI E39), identifies an\nobject  within  the  scope  of  the  service  provider.  An\nobject specifier consists of one or more object type and\nobject     instance     identifier     pairs.     For     example,\n\u201cPM:ETCH>\u201d might be the object specifier of a process\nmodule  (type=PM,  identifier=ETCH)  within  a  cluster\ntool.  If  the  object  specifier  is  omitted,  then  the  default\nobject is assumed.\n7. 1.5  Objects   are   considered   local   to   the   service\nprovider  even  if  they  exist  on  a  remote  module.  That\nmeans  the  service  provider  is  responsible  for  detecting\nevents and accessing data from those objects in a timely\nmanner,  by  whatever  means,  to  provide  the  specified\nservices.\n7. 1.6      Equipment   which   implements   OSS-compliant\nevent  reporting  services  allows  the  service  user  to\nreference equipment components by an object specifier;\nfor example, \u201cPM:ETCH>MFC:CCL4.\u201d\n7. 2  Event  Report  Object  Model  \u2014  Figure  4  shows  the\nobjects,     attributes     (variables),     and     relationships\ninvolved   in   event   reporting.

An  NCS\ncompletes the specification of the user layer by specifying a mapping to a network technology\u2019s interface. The NCS\nmust  specify  its  capabilities  referenced  against  the  ISO  OSI  Reference  Model.  An  NCS  may  utilize  an  open  or\ncommercial solution.

In many\ncases, they may have to implement more than one Network Communication Standard.\n5. 5.2  During  early  adoption,  OEM\u2019s  may  look  to  the  SAN  to  act  as  a  replacement  for  memory  mapped  discrete\nwired IO.

The SEMI SAN standard provides a framework to ensure\ninteroperability  of  these  devices  within  a  network.  The  standard  enables  device  suppliers  and  equipment  control\nsystem developers to achieve that end. The SAN standard comprises five specifications.\n5. 6.2  The first specification is this document, which is the root document and specifies the connection between the\nother documents of the standard. It also specifies the construction for each of the other documents.\n5. 6.3  The  next  specification  is  the  Common  Device  Model  Specification.  Each  device  on  the  SAN  must  comply\nwith this specification.\n5. 6.4  The  third  specification  defines  the  templates  for  creating  ballots  for  specific  device  models  and  additions  to\nthe NCS.\n5. 6.5  The fourth specification is Specific Device Models standard. These standards contain models for various types\nof sensors, actuators, and entities. For instance, a model of a mass flow controller, a manometer, and a thermocouple\nwill be specified.\n5. 6.6  The  fifth  type  of  specification  is  the  Network  Communication  Standards.  Each  network  technology  has  its\nown standard as an ancillary specification to the SAN standard.\n5. 6.7  Applications  notes  may  accompany  a  number  of  the  standards  documents  and  are  intended  to  guide\nimplementors in the application of the standard.\n6  Concepts\n6. 1  Minimal  device  \u2014  The  SAN  specifications  allow  simple  and  complex  devices  to  be  built  compliant  to  the\nstandard.  This  is  done  by  specifying  a  minimum  of  required  attributes,  services,  and  behaviors  in  an  SDM.  The\nSDMs  may  also  provide  optional  service  definitions  that  must  be  followed  if  extended  capabilities  are  to  be  built\ninto  a  device.  Devices  that  do  not  implement  the  extended  capabilities  must  respond  to  extended  service  or  access\nrequests with an appropriate response code rather than failing to respond or issuing an exception or alarm message.\n6. 2  Many  of  the  SAN  NCS  specifications  rely  on  commercial  technology.  A  significant  number  of  network\ntechnologies are available off-the-shelf. The standards do not prescribe a choice. Once a technology described in an\nNCS  is  chosen,  the  NCS  specifies  how  it  is  to  be  applied.  The  SAN  standard  is  easily  extensible  for  future\ntechnologies.\n6. 3  A device supplier must be able to use the standard to describe a device with little or no ambiguity for the device\nusers. For the user, this means that he can select a device with confidence and that it can be easily integrated with his\ncontrol  system.  The  user  must  understand  the  electrical  interface,  the  capabilities,  and  messages  which  a  device\nsupports based on the supplier\u2019s description of how this standard is supported by the device.\n7  Requirements\n7. 1  Organization of the SAN Specifications \u2014 Figures 2 and 3 are intended to assist in understanding the document\nrelationships that are specified in the following subsections.

Generally,  this  information  is  not  balloted,  but  is  included  as  provided  by  the  SEMI  Standards\nProgram  regulations.  Auxiliary  information  shall  always  be  noted  as  such  when  it  accompanies  a  specification  or\nballot.\n7. 2  Interoperability\n7. 2.1  At the Applications Level \u2014 The SDMs are used to derive the definitions for attributes, services, and behavior\nthat  are  unique  to  each  device  type.  A  model  may  discuss  relationships  internal  to  a  device  to  provide  additional\nmeaning  to  the  services  and  attributes  that  can  be  manipulated  over  the  network.

The models shall assure that\ndevices of different types can operate cooperatively at the applications level.\n7. 2.2  Below  the  User  Layer  \u2014  The  various  SANCS  specifications  describe  the  method  by  which  a  device\ncommunicates  over  a  specific  network  such  that  it  can  meet  the  requirements  of  its  type.  All  devices  described\nwithin an NCS shall operate cooperatively on that specific network technology below the user layer.\n7. 2.3  The  SEMI  SAN  standard  does  not  address  methods  for  internet-working  below  the  applications  layer,  as\ndescribed  herein.  An  application  entity  may  connect  to  more  than  one  network.  This  could  be  typical  of  the\napplication entities on the equipment controller. While the SAN standard allows that application entities could exist\nat  any  network  node,  it  requires  no  mechanism  for  a  message  that  begins  on  one  network  to  be  routed  to  another\nnetwork.\n7. 3  SEMI  SAN  Compliance  \u2014  To  fully  describe  the  characteristics  of  a  network  capable  device,  its  compliance\nshall  be  specified  by  reference  to  the  SAN  ancillary  standards.

That  profile  is\nspecified  in  SEMI  E54.1  (Standard  for  Sensor/Actuator  Network  Common  Device  Model)  and  in  the  Common\nDevice Model support section of each NCS.\nR1-1.3.1  Table R1-1 explains where to find specifications for various device operations."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"Table R1-1\nOperation                                     Spec.\nPower applied CDM\nEnable SAC CDM\nEnable DM CDM\nEnable Communications NCS\nEstablish Communication NCS\nSend Events CDM\nReceive messages/answer CDM\nSend messages/accept CDM"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"R1-1.4  Device  Type  \u2014  Each  type  of  device  is  specified  in  the  SDM  specifications.  One  SDM  is  devoted  to  each\ndevice type. An SDM is always a specialization of the CDM. The SDM provides services, behavior, and attributes\nthat are in addition to those specified in the CDM. For example, the SDM of a manometer might specify attributes\nfor current pressure and alarm bands. It might have services needed for performing calibration.\nR1-1.5  Network  Technology  \u2014  How  a  network  technology  is  used  by  the  SAN  standard  is  specified  in  an  NCS.\nThe  NCS  for  a  technology  provides  a  mapping  of  the  CDM  and  SDM  of  a  device  type  to  a  specific  network\nprotocol.\nR1-1.5.1  It is only necessary for a device to support an NCS and the section for its type within that NCS. The NCS\nprovides  all  that  is  needed  to  ensure  that  a  device  can  communicate  and  interoperate  across  a  given  network\ntechnology. The point is that from the other side of the wire, the network-independent interface is not visible. That\ninterface is implied by the behavior of the network interface.\nR1-1.6  Network  Independence  \u2014  Device  suppliers  have  the  option  of  supplying  an  interface  at  the  protocol-\nindependent  applications  layer,  as  indicated  in  Figure  1.

The  device  supplier  can  assure  that  his  device  receives\nsyntactically  correct  messages  at  his  network  interface  layer.  Control  applications  written  to  the  protocol-\nindependent  interfaces  have  the  advantage  that  they  would  not  have  to  be  rewritten  in  order  to  change  to  another\nnetwork. To achieve this, device suppliers would have to ship software, in the form of \u2018device drivers\u2019, that would\nbe installed on the control supplier's platform.\nNOTE 1:  Standards  for  these  \u2018device  drivers\u2019  may  be  developed  at  a  later  time  as  they  do  not  currently  exist.  However,  most\noperating systems used by control systems suppliers support installable device drivers.\nR1-1.7  Recommendations  on  Optional  and  Extended  Device  Capabilities  \u2014  It  is  expected  that  device  suppliers\nwould not compete based on their network interface. Devices traditionally compete based on cost, service, stability,\nreliability, accuracy and repeatability, and relevant dynamic attributes. From a network perspective, all devices have\nthese common characteristics: periodic reporting, polled reporting, asynchronous event reporting, calibration, health,\nand diagnostic reporting. Access and control over the common characteristics should be implemented based on the\nSAN standard. Access and control of the competitive characteristics of devices may be implemented with supplier-\nspecific  interface  extensions.  However,  the  device  supplier  is  strongly  cautioned  in  the  use  of  these  extensions.\nHeavy use of extensions could be a serious competitive disadvantage unless the supplier is the clear winner in all the\ncompetitive characteristics. A locked door could lock one in, it could also lock one out. Device suppliers will usually\nfind that their extensions can be implemented using the optional features of the CDM and SDM.\nNOTE 2:  Network interfaces could be a competitive factor during the early technology adoption phase.\nR1-1.8  The  Controller  Side  Usage  of  the  SAN  Standard  \u2014  The  control  system  supplier  (in  many  cases  this  is  the\nOEM) evolves a different view of SEMI\u2019s SAN standard. They are not as concerned with the network technology as\nwith  utilizing  the  applications  capabilities  as  specified  by  the  CDM  and  SDMs.  It  is  strongly  recommended  that\ncontrol  applications  not  be  network  aware.  This  may  produce  some  operating  overhead,  but  for  most  applications,\nthis is a good trade-off to gain flexibility provided by a protocol-independent interface. Many network devices may\nbe  supplied  without  any  user  layer  (device  driver)  application  side  software.  For  these  devices,  the  control  system\nsupplier would have to do some system\u2019s programming to provide a device driver for the application interface. Over\ntime, it is likely that most devices will be delivered with a device driver. (Similar to the way printers are sold with\nWindows (TM) device drivers. This is what allows Windows applications to use a printer of the end users choosing.)\nR1-1.8.1  The  standards  as  of  1996  do  not  provide  all  the  specifications  needed  to  uniquely  define  how  device\ndrivers  would  be  installed  in  the  controller  side  of  the  API.  This  may  become  a  future  area  of  standardization,  if\nOEMs decide to invest in the standard\u2019s development time.\nR1-1.9  Device Intelligence \u2014 This varies considerably between device types and between devices of the same type.\nSEMI  SAN  specifications  attempt  to  allow  a  range  of  intelligence  to  devices  without  forcing  them  to  be  \u2018highly\u2019\nintelligent.  To  this  end,  the  applications  models  specify  a  required  minimum  set  of  capabilities  that  must  be\nsupported for a device. Optional capabilities generally require more intelligent device operation. Devices that are not\ncapable  of  supporting  these  extended  capabilities  provide  a  \u201cnot  implemented\u201d  indication  if  access  to  those\ncapabilities is requested.\nR1-1.9.1  The following subsections describe device capabilities in order of increasing intelligence. A device\u2019s I/O\ndirection  is  defined  relative  to  the  control  application  entity.  Therefore,  a  sensor  is  an  input,  even  though  from  the\nsensor\u2019s point of view it supplies output values.\nR1-1.9.2  Polled input is the simplest sensor device requirement. All sensing devices should meet this requirement.\nIn  this  mode  of  operation,  a  device  only  reports  its  value(s)  when  requested.  This  mode  potentially  provides  the\nbiggest  burden  on  network  bandwidth.  However,  it  is  the  capability  level  that  is  most  compatible  with  current\ncontrol system architectures.\nR1-1.9.3  Strobed  output  is  the  simplest  actuator  device  requirement.  All  actuating  devices  should  meet  this\nrequirement. This device only changes to a new state at the time of receipt of a specific message to do so."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E54-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1997, 2005 9\nR1-1.9.4  Periodic input is the capability to program the input device so that it sends its value(s) on a scheduled or\nperiodic basis. Network bandwidth burden is reduced because it is not required to send a request each time an update\nfor the input value is needed.\nR1-1.9.4.1  This is also very compatible with current control architectures.\nR1-1.9.5  Asynchronous  input  provides  a  capability  for  a  sensing  device  to  supply  its  value(s)  when  an  event  is\ndetected. These events are usually programmed into the device. Examples of programmable events include threshold\ncrossing of a value, value rate of change, measurement complete.\nR1-1.9.5.1  Devices with this capability can significantly reduce network bandwidth burden, because they only need\nthe network when some event has occurred. Equipment control architectures developed before 1990 may not be able\nto utilize this type of capability.\nR1-1.9.6  Programmed  output  provides  the  capability  for  actuating  devices  to  follow  a  programmable  sequence  of\noperations. For instance, an analog output could be given a ramp profile to follow as it moves between set points.\nR1-1.9.6.1  This  is  another  capability  which  can  greatly  reduce  network  bandwidth  requirements.  But,  it  is  also  a\ncapability that 1990 vintage and earlier control systems may not be able to utilize easily.\nR1-1.9.7  Devices  with  distributed  processing  capabilities  are  able  to  support  features  such  as  monitoring  their\nhealth, providing diagnostics, and programmable preprocessing of data.\nR1-1.9.7.1  These capabilities can have an impact on network burden, but more importantly may improve equipment\nreliability  and  maintainability.  Again,  this  is  a  capability  that  is  not  readily  utilized  by  control  architectures\ndeveloped prior to 1990.\nR1-1.9.8  Devices with distributed control capabilities are capable of being programmed to create peer relationships\nwith other devices on the network. Within these relationships, it is possible for one or more of the peers to control or\nregulate  a  subsystem  within  the  equipment.  For  instance,  a  butterfly  valve  and  manometer  with  these  capabilities\ncould be programmed to hold a particular pressure."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E54-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1997, 2005 10\nRELATED INFORMATION 2\nINDEX FOR SENSOR/ACTUATOR STANDARDS\nNOTICE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E54  and  is  not  intended  to  modify  or  supercede  the  official\nstandard.

Note that the \u201cDevice\u201d object is\ndepicted  in  Figure  3  only  for  purposes  of  illustrating  a\nhigh   level   view   of   the   device   and   its   component\nobjects;  in  the  context  of  this  document,  the  \u201cDevice\u201d\nobject  is  not  addressable,  does  not  have  addressable\nattributes  or  accessible  services,  and  has  no  behavior\ndefined.\nThis  document  defines  in  detail  only  the  DM  object.\nThe  SAC,  Sensor,  Actuator,  and  Controller  objects  are\ndefined here only in terms of characteristics common to\nall  devices.

A view of the SAC object\nis shown in Figure 4. The SAC object coordinates operation of one or more sensor, actuator, and/or control object\ninstances  that  collectively  form  the  sensory/actuation/control  portion  of  the  device,  so  as  to  enable  desired  device\nbehavior.  For  example,  it  could  coordinate  the  operation  of  the  device  sensor,  actuator,  and/or  control  elements  to\nenable  device  level  data  reporting  or  actuation,  alarming  detection  and  servicing,  status  reporting,  device  self-\ntesting, device shutdown, etc. The number of sensor, actuator, and/or controller object instances allowed per device\nmay  be  specified  by  the  appropriate  sensor/actuator  network  specific  device  model.  An  operating  device  shall\ncontain exactly one instance of a SAC object.\nThe  SAC  object  has  embedded  in  it  other  objects  that  address  specific  tasks  associated  with  coordinating  the\ninteraction of the device with the sensor/actuation/control environment. These objects are listed in Table 3. Note that\nalthough  only  one  instance  of  the  SAC  object  is  allowed  per  device,  a  device  can  have  multiple  instances  of\nembedded objects.
