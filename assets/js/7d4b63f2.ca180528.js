Where copper media is used,the EtherNet/IP specification is based on theANSI/TIA/EIA-568-B Category 5/5E cable/connectorspecifications. A Commercial grade and Industrialgrade level of conformance are specified. Thesignaling and coupling are as specified in the IEEE802.3 / TP-PMD standard.6.4 Data Link Layer  For compatibility withEtherNet/IP conformance testing capabilities, thedevice must comply with the Ethernet Data Link LayerSpecifications as specified by IEEE 802.3.

The firstdefines transport level connection sessions, while thelatter defines application level sessions in terms ofExplicit Connection and I/O Connection management.6.8 Presentation Layer  The presentation layer isdefined in terms of standard data types and specificencoding definitions for application layer data.6.9 Application Layer  The device shall comply withthe EtherNet/IP application layer specification fordefining and addressing objects, including theirattributes and services, and enabling specified networkbehavior. The device shall comply with the objectmodel specifications provided in the EtherNet/IPspecification.6.10 Object models  EtherNet/IP provides an object-oriented specification for creating, defining andaddressing objects explicitly, including their attributesand services (i.e., explicit messaging), and creating,defining and communicating object attribute assembliesin an application dependent format (i.e., input/outputmessaging). The device shall comply with the objectmodel specifications provided in the EtherNet/IPdocumentation. In addition, the device shall complywith the object specifications defined in Section 7 ofthis document. 7 Required Object Types7.1 The EtherNet/IP specification identifies anddescribes objects (i.e., classes) that must exist in allEtherNet/IP compliant devices. The Common DeviceModel (CDM) specification additionally identifies twoobjects, the Device Management (DM) and SensorActuator Controller (SAC) objects, that must exist in allSEMI compliant SAN devices. The required objecttypes for a SEMI compliant SAN device utilizing thenetwork communication specification described herein,necessarily comprises the union of the above tworequirements.7.2 A list of required and optional object types is givenin Table 2. Note that the Sensor, Actuator, andController object types are not required, and areindicated as optional in the CDM specification. Theseobjects are aggregated together to form a SEMI andEtherNet/IP compliant device. 7.3 The two required object types from the CDM (theDM and the SAC) are implemented as mappedcomponents in EtherNet/IP; they are mapped to theSEMI-specific S-Device Supervisor object class asdescribed in this section.7.4 The listed object types are: Identity, Message Router (MR), Connection (Conn), Connection Manager (CM), Ethernet Link (EL), TCP/IP Interface (TCP/IP), S-Device Supervisor (S-DS), Device Management (DM), Sensor Actuator Controller (SAC), Sensor, Actuator, and Controller.7.5 Also, although not a network addressable object,each device shall support the Unconnected MessageManager (UCMM) as defined by EtherNet/IP.Table 2 Object Types Required byObject EIPClass ID(SeeNote 1.)

This Network Communication Standard (NCS) takentogether with the SEMI Sensor/Actuator Network standard suite and the PROFINET standard completely andunambiguously defines an open standard providing an industry specific solution to off-the-shelf interoperability ofnetworked devices in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.1.2 PROFINET is a vendor independent, open field bus standard for a wide range of applications in manufacturing,process and building automation.1.3 The application model of PROFINET is compatible with the model of PROFIBUS. The same mapping rulesapply.1.4 PROFINET is optimized for high speed and inexpensive connectivity between automation control systems anddistributed I/O at the device level. 2 Scope2.1 This document specifies a SAN communications standard based on the PROFINET specification that is incompliance with SEMI E54.1. As such, it specifies the protocol, services, and behavior that compliant intelligentdevices must support in order to interchange information over this SAN in a method compatible with SEMI E39.2.2 In conjunction with a SEMI standard SAN Common Device Model (CDM) specification and one or more SEMIstandard Specific Device Model (SDM) specifications (e.g., for a mass flow controller), this NetworkCommunication Standard (NCS) with the related PROFINET standard describe the data structures, interactions, andbehavior that are characteristic of the various devices on the network. This composite model forms a completeinteroperability standard for communications among intelligent sensors, actuators, and controllers in semiconductormanufacturing equipment.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.

PROFINET IOuses physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers of the Reference Model. For real timecommunication a three layer approach with physical, data link and application is specified. This section has beenformatted to be aligned with the Basic Reference Model for OSI. Figure 1 gives an overview of the architecture. OSI Reference Model NCS ModelApplication Layer Application LayerPresentation LayerSession LayerTransport Layer TransportLayerNetwork Layer Network LayerData Link Layer Data Link LayerPhysical Layer Physical Layer Figure 1Layering of PROFINET in Relation to OSI 6.2 General Behavior6.2.1 In a typical remote I/O configuration, single IO controller architectures are used to optimize response times.In lower speed applications, multi IO controller architectures are also possible.6.2.2 Message transfer is organized in cycles. A message cycle mainly consists of a set of Output Data Frames ofthe IO controller and a set of Input Data Frames of several IO devices. Every Output Data Frame is associated to anInput Data Frame. The monitoring of an IO application relationship is done by the receiver of that frames.6.2.3 A brief description of the PROFINET protocol as it relates to the ISO 7498 OSI model follows in the sectionsbelow. For protocol efficiency, PROFINET does not define layers 3 to 7 for cyclic IO data transfer and alarms.Layer 7 is the interface between the Application Process and the communication stack.NOTE 4: The information contained in this section is for reference only. It in no way represents specifications for PROFINET.See related documentation for these specifications.6.3 Physical Layer  Layer 16.3.1 The Physical Layer of IEEE 802.3 is adopted. There are two recommendations specified for the PhysicalLayer (PHY): twisted pair (100 Base TX) and optical (100 Base FX) in PROFINET. See IEEE 802.3 standard formore information about these options. More Details are specified in the PROFINET Installation Guideline.

Protocol DataUnits (PDU) are packaged, delivered, and checked. Checks are used to guard against Line Protocol Errors (e.g.,frame, overrun, and coding violations). IEEE 802.3 Data Link MAC sublayer is the preferred Data link technologyof PROFINET. If an accepted data link standard other than IEEE 802.3 is being used it has to be clearly specified inthe product documentation.6.4.1.2 A PDU is restricted to 1500 bytes. A protocol overhead of 28 Bytes is needed for addressing, errordetection and protocol selection.6.4.2 Conveyance of Data6.4.2.1 In IEEE 802 networks bridges (switches) are used to transport data. These bridge functions are defined inIEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q (priority options). Real time extensions can be used to enhance performance andavailability of bridged networks.6.5 Network Layer  Layer 36.5.1 While real time data transfer uses a protocol with no network layer, all other services are using IP (InternetProtocol) as network layer.6.6 Transport Layer  Layer 46.6.1 All non-real time services are using UDP (User Datagram Protocol) as transport layer.6.7 Session Layer  Layer 56.7.1 There is no distinct Session Layer in this CDM.6.8 Presentation Layer  Layer 66.8.1 There is no distinct Presentation Layer in this CDM. The Encoding is part of the application layer.6.9 Application Layer  Layer 76.9.1 The PROFINET IO application layer is structured in a so called service definition and protocol specification.The service definition uses an object orientated approach and specifies the services for remote access and localfunctions together with their objects (the ASE is a class definition of these objects). The protocol specificationincludes both coding and state machines.6.9.2 Service Definition6.9.2.1 Application layer services are structured to reflect the needs of flexible configurable automation devices. ADevice consists of a set of modules that are placed in slots (see Figure 2). Modules are addressed uniquely by theslot number. The module view can be a hardware oriented or reflects the software structure of the IO Device.6.9.2.2 Each module contains submodules that contain objects of different classes. Submodules are the addresses ofthe submodules.6.9.2.3 Slot 0 is used to address the IO Device itself. Subslot 0 represents the module and contains no IO Data.The other object classes can have instances scattered over the modules and their submodules addressed by slots andtheir subslots respectively. Each submodule (except submodule 0) can contain IO Data, Context parameter,Diagnosis information, Record Data and Alarms. Record Data is a generic class which can contain differentapplication specific parameters accessible by read and write services.

A check isdone to ensure that the appropriate device type with the required resources is accessed. Resources can be lockedwith the connect service.6.9.3.4 After a positive confirmation of the connect service the IO device may be loaded with the parameterrequired by the controller application (e.g. warning limits, measure range, filter time). A control service is issued atthe end of parameterization.6.9.3.5 There is a control service indicating that the IO Device application is ready to enter the operate state. Thestart up is completed with this service.6.9.3.6 After this start up procedure the data exchange of IO data can be done and alarms can be signaled from theIO Device to the IO Controller. The IO Controller can invoke services to read and write record data that contain allkind of information e.g. produced units, calibration information, and batch information.6.9.3.7 A Release service will terminate the context.6.9.3.8 A context is monitored by the receipt of Input Data at the IO controller and by the receipt of Output Data atthe IO device site.

SafetyBUS p provides: A solution to low-level device networking, Access to intelligence present in low-level devices, Networking between higher level controllers, Master/Slave and Peer-to-Peer communication capabilities, and Serial communication of device-critical information.1.2.2 SafetyBUS p specifies a communication model and protocol. The Physical and Data Link Layer definitionsare defined by the Controller Area Network (CAN) technology. The CAN specification provides the Media AccessControl (MAC) methodology and physical signaling characteristics.1.2.3 This document enables communications between intelligent devices on a SEMI compliant SAN by providinga presentation mapping of common and specific device network visible structure and behavior to SafetyBUS pnetwork.1.2.4 This Network Communication Standard specification for SafetyBUS p is not intended to be a safety guidelinefor using SafetyBUS p technology. This document specifies a SAN communications standard specification basedon the Object Communication Specification (OCS) for the SafetyBUS p Protocol. This SAN is structured incompliance with SEMI E54.1. 2 Scope2.1 This document specifies the protocol and services that compliant intelligent devices shall support to exchangeinformation over the SafetyBUS p semiconductor equipment sensor/actuator network.2.2 This document specifies the utilization of the SafetyBUS p protocol to present externally visible devicestructure and behavior, specified in the Common Device Model (CDM) and appropriate Specific Device Models(SDMs), on a SafetyBUS p network.2.3 This document is used in conjunction with a SEMI standard SAN Common Device Model specification, one ormore SEMI standard Specific Device Model (SDM) specifications (e.g. for a mass flow device), the SafetyBUS pObject Communications Specification Reference Guide. Together, they describe the SafetyBUS p protocol, theexternally visible data structures and behaviors of devices utilizing the SafetyBUS p networking capability in aSEMI compliant SAN system."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 30 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E54.15-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2005 2 NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This document specifies a semiconductor equipment SAN based solely on SafetyBUS p and is a companiondocument to the Object Communication Specification for the SafetyBUS p Protocol; thus a complete specificationof this standard necessarily includes the SafetyBUS p protocol specifications. There are other semiconductorequipment SAN communications options. The specifications for these options are not included.3.2 This standard specifies enhancements that provide additional capabilities over and above those currentlyrequired by SafetyBUS p.
