SEMI G76-0299 © SEMI 19995 8.4 Dimension Test Procedure8.4.1 Thickness(1) Equipment  Use a micrometer standardized toJIS C-2318 or equivalent.(2) Material  Use the TCP polyimide adhesivetape as received from the supplier.(3) Measurement  Measure the center, and 3points at least 1m apart in the MD direction,and calculate the average. 8.4.2 Width(1) Equipment  Use a projector capable ofreading a minimum of 0.001 mm integrals.(2) Material  Use the TCP polyimide adhesivetape as received from the supplier.(3) Measurement  Measure the TD directionlength in 3 points at least 1m apart in the MDdirection, and calculate the average. 8.5 Mechanical Efficiency Tests8.5.1 Copper Foil Adhesive Strength(1) Equipment(a) A pull tester with an appropriatemeasurement range, having a tolerance of ±5% of the indicated value, and capable ofmaintaining a cross-head speed of 1050mm/min.(b) A pull tester with a sample retention heatingdevice or sample chamber for retainingsurface temperature for measuring conditions.(2) Material(a) Normal  Use a sample with copper etchingand conductor width of 50 ± 10 m andconductor length of more than 30 mm. Themeasurement direction and number ofsamples should be previously determined bythe user and supplier. Unless otherwisespecified, use 2 samples and measure in theMD direction.(b) Heated  Use the same as (a), except with aconductor width of 2 ± 0.5 mm.(3) Measurement(a) Normal  After measuring the sampleconductor width, fix the sample in the pulltester. In order to keep peeling angle at 90°,affix a reinforcement panel with double-sided adhesive tape. Pull and peel off morethan 20 mm of copper foil at a speed of 10 mm/min -1 and an angle of 90 ± 5°. Measurethe load during this interval.(b) Heated  Fix the sample in retention heatingdevice of the pull tester and raise thetemperature, or, fix the sample in apreviously retention heating device in thepull tester. It is also feasible to use a samplechamber which can heat the whole sample.Measure the sample surface temperaturewith a contact surface thermometer, andwhen a temperature of 150 ± 5°C isconfirmed, quickly pull and peel off morethan 20 mm of copper foil at a speed of 10mm/min -1 and an angle of 90 ± 5°. Measurethe load during this interval.(c) Soaked in Solvent  After soaking thesample in a specified solvent at 23 ± 5°Cfor 5 minutes, remove the sample and rinseand dry off solvent thoroughly. Place innormal conditions, as described in Section8.1.1, for 24 ± 4 hours and perform thesame test as above "normal" (3)(a).However, if the solvent is inorganic, washsample well with water after taking it outof the solvent and dry at 80 ± 5°C for 30minutes. Then place in normal conditions,as described in Section 8.1.1, for 24 ± 4hours and perform the same test as above"normal" (3)(a). The type and condition ofthe solvent used shall be agreed betweenthe user and supplier.(4) Calculation(a) Compile the measurements, leaving out theovershoot at the beginning and end, andcalculate the average of samples with astable section of 10 mm. The method ofcalculating the average should bepredetermined by the user and supplier.Unless otherwise speci-fied, place a rulerover the chart and determine visually.(b) Calculate the load on pulling and peelingoff of each sample, excluding the samplesconductor width, and the average will bethe copper foil adhesive strength. 8.5.2 Cover Film Release Strength(1) Equipment  Use the same equipment as inSection 8.5.1 (1).(2) Material  Use a 250 mm section cut from theTCP polyimide adhesive tape as received fromthe vendor.

SEMI G76-0299 © SEMI 1999 6 (3) Measurement  After measuring the samplecover film width, fix the sample in the pulltester. In order to keep the sample at 90°, affixa reinforcement panel with double-sidedadhesive tape. Pull and peel off more than 50mm of cover film at a speed of 50 mm/min -1and an angle of 90 ± 5°. Measure the loadduring this interval.(4) Calculation  Use the same method as Section8.5.1, (4). 8.6 Electrical Efficiency Test8.6.1 Volume Resistivity(1) Equipment  Use high insulation-resistancemeter which conforms to JIS C-1303, orsimilar resistance measuring device (seeFigure 2).(2) Material - Prepare a section of TCPpolyimide adhesive tape with adhesivematerial width of more than 50 mm, laminatewith copper foil and cure according to themethod described in Section 8.2. In addition,etch the main electrode and guard electrodeinto the shapes found in Figure 3. For the counter electrode, melt on a conductivematerial to the opposing polyimide filmsurface, or form it out of conductive paste. Drythese at 80 ± 5°C for 30 minutes. Cut theseinto 50 mm squares for the material.(3) Measurement  Use the following steps tomeasure under normal conditions: Measure thethickness of the samples in units of 0.1 m,and measure the inner diameter of the gap inthe circular upper electrode in units of 0.05mm. Apply direct voltage of 500V ± 5V, andmeasure the resistance value after 1 minute.(4) Calculation  Use the equation below. )/(41 cmtDRvv Ω= Where v is volume resistivity, Rv is resistancevalue, t is sample thickness,  is pi, and D 1 is mainelectrode outer diameter.
