The minimum bar matrix shall be 1 dothorizontal and 11 dots/mm vertical as shown in Table 1and Figure 1. The minimum matrix for alphanumericcharacters shall be as specified in SEMI M12. In eithercase, more dots may be used, up to and including asolid line. 5 BC-412 Code 1 5.1 Characteristics  BC-412 is a presence-absencebar code symbology which uses an alphanumericcharacter set as outlined in Table 2. The name BC-412is derived from the method used to encode datacharacters. Each data character is comprised of foursingle-width bars incremented within 12 modules. Thecode is a continuous code.5.2 Character Set  The character set available formarking wafers consists of the ten digits (09) and allcapital letters in the English alphabet except O as listedin Table 3. In addition, there is a start character and astop character.5.2.1 Character Construction and Value  Themodule sequence and value for use in calculating thecheck character are listed for each character in Table 3.5.3 Symbol Content  All character count and contentin the wafer marking symbol are user-definable andvary in number from 7 to 18. The checksum characterposition is fixed. 6 Optional Alphanumeric Code6.1 The optional alphanumeric symbol is variable anduser definable, and similar to existing SEMI standardsM12 and M13 with respect to font style.6.2 The characters may be oriented with the bottom ortop of each character toward the primary fiducial userdefinable.6.3 The characters in the optional alphanumericsymbol are those in position #3 through position #(n + 2) of the BC-412 symbol (see Table 4). 7 Code Field Locations7.1 The code field locations for flatted and notchedwafers are specified in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.Values of the dimensions for both cases are given inTable 5. 1 IBM Corporation, 2000 Purchase Street, Purchase, NY 10577,Director of Commercial Relations

SEMI T1-95 © SEMI 1993, 20033 7.2 The dimensions given in Table 5 are those foundon the finished wafer, regardless of where in theprocess the wafer is marked.7.3 These dimensions are derived with the assumptionthat both the bar code and the optional alphanumericmarkings are placed on the wafer without realignmentof the wafer.7.4 The code field locations are defined by the limits ofthe bar code elements and the optional alphanumericcharacters. Character dimensions are from centerline tocenterline of the extreme features of the character. 8 Definition of the Error-Detecting Method8.1 Define the following symbols:CD = Check characteri = Position of a data character withina string from left to right, i ≥ 1CV(i) = Character value of i (Table 4)Fo = Mod 35 CV(i)i =odd( )Fe = Mod 35 CV(i)i =even( )F = Mod 35 Fo + 2Fe( )8.2 Compute the check character:8.2.1 Assign the value 0 to the check character(position #4, second character in string).8.2.2 Calculate F o and Fe.8.2.3 Calculate F.8.2.4 Calculate CD as Mod 35(17  F). 8.3 Verification8.3.1 Recalculate Fe and Fo with the value of CD foundin Section 8.2.4 to the second character in the string(position #4).8.3.2 Calculate F.8.3.3 If F = 0, the check character is correct.8.4 As an example, calculate the check character forA\_Q45670 as follows:8.4.1 Write the code as A0Q45670.8.4.2 Calculate F o, Fe , and F:Fo = Mod 35 (A(i) + Q(i) + 5(i) + 7(i)) =Fo = Mod 35 (7 + 18 + 33 + 21) = Mod 35 (79) = 9Fo = Mod 35 (0 + 11 + 19 + 0) = Mod 35 (30) = 30F = Mod 35 (9 + 60) = Mod 35 (69) = 348.4.3 Calculate the value for CD:CD = Mod 35 (17  34) = Mod 35 (578) = 188.4.4 This corresponds to the character, Q, so thesymbol is now AQQ45670.8.4.5 Verify that the check character in AQQ45670 iscorrect as follows:Fo = Mod 35 (A(i) + Q(i) + 5(i) + 7(i))= Mod 35 (7 +18 + 33 + 21) = Mod 35 (79) = 9Fe = Mod 35 (Q(i) + 4(i) + 6(i) + 0(i))= Mod 35 (18 +11+ 19 + 0) = Mod 35 (48) = 13F = Mod 35 (Fo + 2Fe )= Mod 35 (9 + 26) = Mod 35 (35) = 0 Table 1 Character Dimensions (see Figure 1)Module Height(dot centerline to dot centerline)2.000 mm ± 0.025 mm (0.0790" ± 0.0010") Bar Code Character Spacing(centerline to centerline, non-cumulative within the SymbolLength \[see Table 2\]) 1.440 mm ± 0.025 mm (0.0570" ± 0.0010") Mark Width 0.110 mm ± 0.025 mm (0.0043" ± 0.0010")Module Spacing(centerline to centerline, non-cumulative within the CharacterSpacing \[see above\]) 0.120 mm ± 0.025 mm (0.0047" ± 0.0010") Scribing Features: Scribing Features:Density of dots along module length 11 dots/mm, minimumNumber of dots per module width 1 dot per module widthCharacter Construction: # of Bars # of Spaces ModulesData Character 4 8 12Start Character 1 2 3Start Character Dimension 0.360 mm ± 0.025 mm (0.0140" ± 0.0010")Stop Character 2 1 3Stop Character Dimension 0.360 mm ± 0.025 mm (0.0140" ± 0.0010")

SEMI T2-0298 (Reapproved 1104)SPECIFICATION FOR MARKING OF WAFERS WITH A TWO-DIMENSIONAL MATRIX CODE SYMBOL This specification was technically approved by the Global Traceability Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Traceability Committee. Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Traceability Committee on July 11, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; tobe published November 2004. Originally published in 1993; last published February 1998. 1 Purpose1.1 This specification is intended to provide a markingsymbology that can be used to mark silicon wafers withminimum intrusion into the fixed quality area of thewafer. 2 Scope2.1 This specification defines the geometric and spa-tial relationships and content (including the error check-ing and correcting code) of a two-dimensional (2-D),machine-readable, binary matrix code symbol for frontsurface marking of wafers of silicon which comply withSEMI M1, SEMI M2, or SEMI M11, and other mater-ials with diameters of 125 to 200 mm. This specifica-tion allows for consistency of all wafer marking per-formed by wafer manufacturers. It may be used in con-junction with, or as an alternative to, the alphanumericmarking codes specified in SEMI M12 and SEMI M13or a front surface bar code like that specified in SEMIT1.2.2 Although this specification does not specify themarking techniques that may be employed when com-plying with its requirements, it is assumed that the sym-bol will be obtained by laser scribing individual dots.2.3 The 2-D matrix code is applicable to a broad rangeof wafer products, including epitaxial wafers, SOI wa-fers, and unpatterned or patterned polished wafers. Theformat and algorithms of this code are based on the Da-ta Matrix two-dimensional symbology specified in AIMInternational Symbology Specification - Data Matrix.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI AUX001  List of Vendor Identification CodesSEMI M1  Specifications for Polished Monocrys-talline Silicon WafersSEMI M2  Specification for Silicon Epitaxial Wafersfor Discrete Device ApplicationsSEMI M11  Specifications for Silicon EpitaxialWafers for Integrated Circuit (IC) ApplicationsSEMI M12  Specification for Serial AlphanumericMarking of the Front Surface of WafersSEMI M13  Specification for Alphanumeric Markingof Silicon WafersSEMI T1  Specification for Back Surface Bar CodeMarking of Silicon Wafers3.2 AIM International Technical Specification1 AIM International Symbology Specification - DataMatrix3.3 ANSI Standard2 ANSI X3.4  American Standard Code forInformation Interchange (ASCII)NOTE 1: This standard is equivalent to ISO 646, InformationProcessing - ISO 7-bit Coded Character Set for InformationProcessing.NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 1 AIM International Inc., 125 Warrendale-Bayne Road, Warrendale,PA 15086, +1 724 934 4470, Fax: +1 724 934 4495,http://www.aimglobal.org/2 American National Standards Institute, Headquarters: 1819 LStreet, NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA.

The first 10 message characters shall contain two elements: a vendor-assigned 8-character wafer identification code, followed by a 2-character vendor identification code as defined in SEMI AUX001.6.3.2.1 The remaining message characters, if any, shall contain information as agreed between the vendor and user.6.3.3 The total number of message characters available depends on the row/column count and on the encodedcharacter set (see Table 2).6.4 Location of the Matrix Code Symbol6.4.1 With the wafer positioned front surface up and with the primary fiducial toward the operator, the referencepoint of the matrix code symbol shall be located as specified in Table 3.6.4.2 The square matrix code symbol used on 125 to 200 mm diameter wafers shall be oriented with the bordercolumns parallel with the primary fiducial bisector and the border rows perpendicular to the primary fiducialbisector. The secondary border column shall be toward the primary fiducial bisector, and the primary border rowshall be toward the edge of the wafer.6.4.3 The nominal position of the reference point of the matrix code symbol is 1 mm to the right of the closestalphanumeric code field. A 3 skew toward the alphanumeric field, which is the maximum skew allowed by SEMIM12 and SEMI M13, does not cause the matrix code symbol to impinge on the alphanumeric code fields, even if thesymbol is placed only 15.5 mm from the primary fiducial bi-sector. Consequently, this matrix code symbol positionpermits the simultaneous use of front surface alphanumeric marking as specified in SEMI M12 or M13, on 125 to200 mm wafers with either flatted or notched primary fiducials.6.4.4 Because the matrix code symbol is located in the same place with respect to the primary fiducial bisector onall wafer diameters from 125 to 200 mm, the use of both marking and reading equipment is simplified.

6.4.5 The distance from the edge of the data matrix code symbol to the diameter perpendicular to the primaryfiducial bisector varies according to the actual size of the wafer and the placement of the symbol within its tolerancerange. Minimum distances from the edge of the code symbol to the wafer center-line are given in Table 4 for both16  16, 125 m and 20  20, 150 m matrix code symbols.

APPENDIX 1SIMULTANEOUS MARKING WITH SQUARE DATA MATRIX ANDALPHANUMERIC CODES NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI T2 and was approved by full letter ballotprocedures.A1-1 The relative positions of alphanumeric and data matrix markings are shown in Figure A1-1. This figure alsoshows the relationship between the data matrix code symbol and the edge of the polished area of the front surface ofthe wafer. Wafer peripheries in the figure are the edges of the polished area of wafers with maximum intrusion ofthe edge contour, minimum diameter, and maximum flat diameter (minimum flat length), or distance between thenotch pin centerline and the wafer edge, as specified in SEMI M1. For all wafer diameters, SEMI M1 allows theedge contour to extend inward from the edge up to 508 m (Dimension B in Figure 4 of SEMI M1). The distancebetween the notch pin centerline and the wafer periphery may vary from 0.30 to 0.80 mm as indicated in Figure 6 ofSEMI M1. Other dimensions and tolerances are specified in the appropriate polished wafer specification in SEMIM1.A1-2 Alphanumeric code field locations are shown for all cases except the SEMI M13 code field for flatted wafers,which lies entirely to the left of the primary fiducial bisector. Note that alphanumeric code field locations are notspecified for 125 mm diameter notched wafers in either SEMI M12 or SEMI M13.A1-3 The nominal position of the reference point of the data matrix code symbol is marked by a +; this position is 1mm to the right of the closest alphanumeric code field. Because of the tolerances on the position of the referencepoint, the largest data matrix code symbol (20  20, 150 m cell spacing) may lie anywhere within the dottedsquare. The effect of a 3 skew toward the alphanumeric field is also shown. Although the skew does not affectreadability of the data matrix code symbol, too great a skew may cause the data matrix symbol code to impinge onoccupied areas of the wafer surface. The 3 skew, which is the maximum allowed by SEMI M12 and SEMI M13,does not cause the data matrix code symbol to impinge on the alphanumeric code fields. SEMI T2-0298 © SEMI 1993, 20047

SEMI T3-0302 © SEMI 1995, 20021 SEMI T3-0302SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS This specification was technically approved by the Global Traceability Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Traceability Committee. Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on November 27, 2001. Initially available at www.semi.orgFebruary 2002; to be published March 2002.NOTE: This document was entirely rewritten forpublication in 2002.1 Purpose1.1 This specification provides a common format,content, size, and location for printed, machine-readable labels on wafer boxes to facilitatecommunication of data essential for advancedtraceability and electronic data exchange systems.These labels differ from those used in commoncommercial practice in that they provide less detailedinformation about parametric properties of the wafer.Such information is now readily stored in advancedtraceability systems.1.2 This specification covers labels that contain twobar code symbols and their associated human-readableinterpretation.1.3 This specification also covers a two-dimensionalData Matrix code symbol that can accommodatesubstantially more information than can the bar codesymbols. This symbol is included to provide for asmooth transition from existing traceability and labelingprocedures to the comprehensive, unified systemenvisioned for the future in which common readingequipment can be used throughout the plant. If theData Matrix symbol is used without the bar codesymbols, provision is made for an associated humanreadable interpretation.1.4 Labels provided in accordance with this specifi -cation satisfy the special requirements of 300 mmWafer Shipping Systems, detailed in SEMI M45, forboth front opening shipping box (FOSB) labels and baglabels. 2 Scope2.1 This specification covers size, message content andsymbology requirements of labels for wafer boxes usedfor storage and transport of silicon wafers 100 mm indiameter and larger.2.2 For wafer boxes used with 100 to 200 mm diameterwafers, this specification provides for two similar labelsin order that the contents of the wafer box can beidentified when the wafer box is stored in either of twopositions: with the side of the wafer box parallel withthe front of the storage shelf or with the end of thewafer box parallel with the front of the storage shelf. Because wafer boxes are routinely stacked for storage,placement of box labels on the top or bottom of the boxis not recommended.2.3 For FOSBs used with 300 mm wafers, thisspecification provides for two identical labels, one to beplaced on the FOSB and the other to be placed on theouter bag. These requirements are consistent with therequirements of SEMI M45. SEMI M31 specifiesFOSB dimensions.2.4 The message content and locations of the symbolsused on the labels covered by this specification aredesigned to fit in a space consistent with size of theavailable flat area on wafer boxes investigated. If alarger flat area is available on the wafer boxes to beused, the label size may be increased and additionalmessage content included.2.5 This specification includes descriptions of thecharacteristics of the code formats to be employed.2.6 The labels covered by this specification may beapplied on the box itself, and on the box wrap portionof the wafer package, but not on the transport package(outer shipping carton) used for commercialtransportation of wafer packages.NOTE 1: Specifications for transaction labels, which areintended for use on the outer shipping carton, are given inANSI/EIA 556-B.2.6.1 The format of the barcode is based on Code 39,as specified in ISO/IEC 16388.2.6.2 The format of the Data Matrix Code is specifiedin ISO/IEC 16022.2.7 Wafer box labels are intended to be applied in acleanroom environment concurrent with the completionof production of the wafers. Although it is recognizedthat the materials of construction and the adhesivesused to apply the label must be selected with this use inmind, their specification is beyond the scope of thisdocument.2.8 The dimensions in this specification are applicableto labels printed with printers that have nominalresolution of 203 dots per inch (dpi). Printers withhigher resolution may be used, but many of thedimensions may differ from those in this specificationand the code fields may or may not fit within thespecified label size and format. In such cases, the user

&lt;!-- Page 20 --&gt;

SEMI T3-0302 © SEMI 1995, 2002 2 of this specification must ensure that the label is of asize that fits the box to be employed.2.9 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Referenced Documents3.1 SEMI StandardsAUX1  List of Vendor Identification CodesSEMI M1.15  Standard for 300 mm Polished Mono-crystalline Silicon Wafers (Notched)SEMI M12  Specification for Serial AlphanumericMarking of the Front Surface of WafersSEMI M13  Specification for Alphanumeric Markingof Silicon WafersSEMI M31  Provisional Specification for Front-Opening Shipping Box Used to Transport and Ship 300mm WafersSEMI M45  Provisional Standard for 300 mm WaferShipping SystemSEMI T1  Specification for Back Surface Bar CodeMarking of Silicon WafersSEMI T2  Specification for Marking of Wafers witha Two-Dimensional Matrix Code SymbolSEMI T7  Specification for Back-surface Marking ofDouble-side Polished Wafers with a Two-dimensionalData Matrix Code Symbol3.2 ANSI Standards1 ANSI/ASC X3.182  Bar Code Print Quality - Guide-lineANSI MH10.8.2  Data Application Identifier Stan-dard3.3 EIA Standards2 ANSI/EIA-556-B  Outer Shipping Container LabelStandardANSI/EIA 706  Component Marking Standard 1 American National Standards Institute, New York Office: 11 West42nd Street, New York, NY 10036, USA.

This related information was approved forpublication by full letter ballot procedures. R1-1 Considerations for Reliable AutomaticReading of the MarkingR1-1.1 The following suggestions are offered to assistin assuring the most reliable automatic reading of thealphanumeric marking.R1-1.2 Character Stroke Thickness  If a 5  9 dotmatrix is chosen for marking, it is recommended thatthe minimum dot size be 0.100 mm. Double or higherdensity dot matrix is recommended; when used, smallerdot diameters may be employed. Stroke thicknessshould be constant withing 20% over the entirecharacter set so that the reader settings may beoptimized for the specific wafer run.R1-1.3 Contrast  The character should havesufficient contrast to be legible. Contrast may beaffected by depth and other conditions.R1-1.4 Clear Zone  It is recommended that the areaimmediately beneath and a minimum of 0.500 mmaround the marking characters be of uniformreflectivity and free of any lithography and processoverlay edges. R1-2 Considerations for the Use of FrontSurface MarkingsR1-2.1 Marks can impinge upon areas where devicesmay be printed. Since mask geometries are varied,considerations of the mark area should be made in maskdesign and also when applying the mark specificationsto existing mask designs.R1-2.2 When the mark is applied prior to epitaxialdeposition, a crown or epi may grow along the markedge. The height of this crown will depend upon the epithickness and the deposition process.NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties orrepresentations as to the suitability of the standards setforth herein for any particular application.

For a descrip-tion of the EDI business applications, see Appendices 1and 2.2.2 This standard may be used to report test results forall products used in the semiconductor industry whenthe applicable codes are included in a SEMI standard.It is intended to provide a consistent method fortransmit-ting test results throughout the industry. Anyimplemen-tation of this document shall be agreed uponbetween trading partners.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI AUX001  List of Vendor Identification CodesSEMI M12  Specification for Serial AlphanumericMarking of the Front Surface of WafersSEMI M18  Format for Silicon Wafer SpecificationForm for Order Entry 3.2 ANSI Standards1 ASC X12  863 Report of Test Results, version 003release 050ASC X12  Data DictionaryNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 4 Terminology4.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms4.1.1 ANSI  American National Standards Institute4.1.2 ASC X12 (Accredited Standards Committee X12) Comprised of industry members for the purpose ofcreating EDI standards for submission to ANSI forsubsequent approval and dissemination.4.1.3 EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)  Thecomputer-to-computer exchange of information whichhas tradi-tionally been communicated using paperdocuments.4.2 Definitions4.2.1 certificate of analysis EDI message  onemessage containing measurement or statistical data forone shipment, from one supplier site to one user site, ofone user part number against one user purchase ordershipped.

This message contains specificmeasurement or statistical data for one request, fromone trading partner to another trading partner, of onepart number against one purchase order. Multiple lotnumbers may be included (see Appendix 5).4.2.9 trading partner  all members within thechannels of distribution within an industry (suppliers,carriers, users, and intermediaries)2 . This includesbuyers and sellers which represent SEMI terms of userand supplier as well. 5 Requirements5.1 An implementation model shall be agreed upon bytrading partners. It is the intent of this document tomake interpretation of the models used for transmittingelectronic messages more consistent, so thatimplementations are based upon common practices.5.1.1 Select one of the report types in Table 1 using thebusiness model (Appendix 1) and the definitions foundin Section 4.Table 1 Report Types Code Type of EDI MessageCA Certificate of AnalysisRT Test ResultsSR Statistical Results 5.1.2 Define data requirements representing therequested measurements and statistics that are recordedfor reporting electronically. (See Appendix 2.)5.1.3 Select codes for parameters, units of measure,and statistical terms. Appendix 4 is a guideline to assistin modeling the EDI message. It uses codes selectedfrom the ANSI Data Dictionary as well as codes createdby SEMI for the semiconductor industry. 2 The term Trading Partner is referenced from the GlobalElectronics Guidelines (DRAFT) for Bar Code & 2D SymbolMarking of Products and Packages in Conjunction with EDI. 5.1.4 Data is electronically reformatted from theapplication where it resides into a format suitable forEDI transmission. This usually requires the use oftranslation software and the development of applicationinterface programs.5.2 Thorough piloting, testing, and educating isrequired for successful implementation. 6 Procedures6.1 See Appendix 4. 7 Application Notes7.1 Pending ANSI approval, SEMI is an authorizedagency to maintain the tables of codes.7.2 The material contained in Appendix 4 was createdby using an EDI simulator referencing the ASC X12863 Report of Test Reports, version 003 release 050.7.3 In using Appendix 4, refer to the column SEMIUse (far-left) to determine if data element usage ismandatory, conditional, or optional. SEMI mandatoryelements include all ASC X12 863 mandatory elements,as well as selected other elements that are optional orconditional within ASC X12 863.7.4 In Appendix 5, the example messages in thisappendix were simplified by showing only a portion ofwhat they can do. In practice, all of the transactiontypes (CA, RT, and SR) can use any combination of thestatistical codes in Appendix 4, the new statistical codesin Appendix 4, or raw measurement data.7.5 Additional statistical codes are defined inAppendix 3. These codes are pending ANSI approval.7.6 This procedure will accommodate date/timeconsiderations for the turn of the century. There aremany options found in the data transmission segmentsin this document. The end result for which option isutilized will be agreed upon by the trading partners.The message is itself part of the ANSI standard, andany revisions to this standard will be incorporated.7.6.1 In the data element type, DT is a standard ANSIdefinition and is being addressed by ASC X12Committee.7.6.2 In the BTR segment, used to identify the date ofthe actual transmission, BTR06 may be used as acentury reference number.7.6.3 In the DTM segments, used to identify the datefor the actual data, the DTM05 data element of CCrepresents a two-digit century code (e.g., 19 for 1999,20 for 2000).
