At  cryogenic  temperatures,  the  thickness  of  the\ntest slices can range from 2.0 to 4.0 mm.\n6. 2 A reference slice of known low carbon content (see\nSection 3.2) is prepared in the same manner.\n6. 3 After verifying that the instrument is suitably set up,\ntransmittance  spectra  of  the  sample  and  reference  are\nobtained  over  the  range  from  700  to  500  cm\n\u22121\n(14.3  to\n20. 0 \u03bcm)  on  a  double-beam  dispersive  or  single-beam\nFourier  Transform  Infrared  (FT-IR)  spectrophotometer\nin accordance with manufacturer's instructions.\n6. 4    Absorbance    spectra    are    derived    from    these\ntransmittance  spectra  and  a  carbon-only  spectrum  is\nobtained  as  the  difference  between  the  two  absorbance\nspectra.\n6. 5  A  baseline  is  drawn  between  the  regions  on  both\nsides  of  the  carbon  peak  on  this  difference  absorbance\nspectrum,  and  absorbance  values  of  both  the  peak  and\nbaseline are recorded.\n6. 6   The   absorbance   peak   height   is   taken   as   the\ndifference between these two values.  This peak height,\ncorrected   for   sample   thickness,   is   multiplied   by   a\nconstant  to  calculate  the  substitutional  carbon  concen-\ntration.  Two constants are used, one for measurements\nat  room  temperature  (300  K),  and  one  for  measure-\nments at cryogenic temperatures (below 80 K).\n7  Apparatus\n7. 1 Infrared  Spectrophotometer  \xf3  Either  a  dispersive\n(computerized or non-computerized) or a Fourier trans-\nform  (FT-IR)  spectrophotometer  may  be  used.

A  column  of  mercury  is  brought  into  contact\nwith  the  epitaxial  or  polished  surface  of  the  specimen\nby  a  pressure  differential  between  the  mercury  and\nambient  to  form  a  Schottky  barrier  diode  (mercury\nprobe contact).\n6. 3    A  low-resistance  return  contact  is  also  made  to\neither  the  front  or  back  surface  of  the  wafer.    This\ncontact   may   be   either   a   metal   plate   or   a   second\nmercury-silicon  contact  with  an  area  much  larger  than\nthe mercury probe contact.\n6. 4  The quality of the Schottky barrier diode formed by\nthe mercury probe contact is evaluated by measuring its\nseries resistance and its reverse current characteristics.\n6. 5  The small-signal, high frequency capacitance of the\nmercury probe contact is measured as a function of the\nvoltage applied between the mercury probe column and\nthe  return  contact.    The  polarity  of  the  applied  voltage\nis such that the mercury probe contact is reverse biased\nand the low-resistance return contact is forward biased.\n6. 6    The  net  carrier  density  profile  (net  carrier  density\nas  a  function  of  depth  from  the  surface)  is  calculated\nfrom  the  measured  values  of  capacitance  and  applied\nvoltage by one of two equivalent methods.\nNOTE  2:    Net  carrier  density  values  obtained  by  this  test\nmethod are often converted to resistivity, which is generally a\nmore  familiar  parameter  in  the  industry.    If  this  is  done,  the\nconversion    should    be    made    in    accordance    with    the\ncomputational methods given in Section 7.2 of SEMI MF723.\nNote  that  in  applying  this  conversion  procedure  in  either\ndirection  it  is  assumed  that  the  net  carrier  density  is  equal  to\nthe dopant density.\n7  Apparatus\n7. 1  Mercury  Probe  Fixture  \u2014  One  of  the  following\nfixtures  depending  on  the  type  of  test  specimen  to  be\nmeasured.

In   the   first\nexperiment, ten nominally 50 \u2126\xb7cm n-type wafers were\nmeasured on two days by two different operators using\na single instrument.  The pooled coefficient of variation\nwas   0.183%;   the   largest   observed   coefficient   of\nvariation was 0.35%.\n14. 1.1    Based  on  the  pooled  value,  the  repeatability,  r,\nis   estimated   to   be   about   0.51%.      In   the   second\nexperiment,  ten  nominally  1  \u2126\xb7cm n-type  wafers  were\nmeasured three times on a single instrument by a single\noperator.  The wafer surfaces were treated prior to each\nmeasurement.    The  pooled  coefficient  of  variation  was\n0. 493%;  based  on  this  value    the  repeatability,  r,  is\nestimated to be about 1.37%.\n14. 2  Reproducibility \u2014 The reproducibility of this test\nmethod has not been evaluated because of difficulties in\nestablishing  and  applying  a  common  specimen  surface\npreparation   for   use   in   a   round   robin   to   evaluate\nreproducibility.

Interferences\n6. 1  The  interferences  in  conventional  X-ray  fluorescence  spectroscopy  are  common  to  TXRF  also.  These  include,  but  are\nnot limited to:  overlap of fluorescence lines, escape peak and sum peak overlap, energy gain  calibration drift, X-ray source\nstability,  and  instrumental  background  peaks.    However,  no  X-ray  fluorescence  corrections  for  secondary  fluorescence  or  for\nmatrix absorption are required for TXRF. Interferences common to software  procedures and calculations can be evaluated by\ncomparing data sets; see Annex A1.\n6. 2 In addition to conventional interferences, there are interferences that are unique to TXRF as follows:\n6. 2.1 If the glancing angle calibration is not reproducible, variability is introduced to the measurement,\n6. 2.2 If the glancing angle calibration is inaccurate, bias is introduced to the measurement,\n6. 2.3 If the anglescan of the known elemental impurity on the calibration specimen is different from the elemental impurity\nanglescan    on  the  test  specimen,  this  may  introduce  a  bias  to  the  quantification.  An    example  can  be  the  measurement  of\nparticulate  metal  contamination  on  a  test    specimen  while  using  a  calibration  specimen  which  has  the  calibration  metal\nlocalized within the native oxide,\n6. 2.4 Mechanical vibration may degrade the detector energy resolution, and this may degrade detection limits,\n6. 2.5 If the specimen is not chem-mechanically polished, there will be a loss in detection capability, a bias in quantification,\nand    an  increase  in  variability  of  the  measurement.  There  is  some  possibility  that    the  surface  roughness  and  waviness\ndifferences  from  different  cleaning  processes    may  cause  these  interferences  also.  The  semiquantitative  effect  of  surface\nroughness upon the TXRF measurement is under study.\n6. 2.6 Bias in the assigned elemental areal density of the calibration specimen can introduce bias into the TXRF measured\nareal densities,\n6. 2.7  Surface  contamination  introduced  during  handling  of  the  test  specimens  or  during  the  measurement  itself  will\nintroduce a bias  to the measurement, if this surface contamination contains the element(s)  to be measured,\n6. 2.8 Bias in the RSF of a fluorescence line can introduce bias to the measurement,\n6. 2.9  Nonlinearity  of  detected  fluorescence  signal  versus  impurity  areal  density  may  occur  due  to  high  deadtime  of  some\ndetectors under  the condition of high-total signal count rates, and\n6. 2.10 Fluorescence curve smoothing may affect the quantification accuracy.\n6. 2.11  Instrumental  peaks  may  be  generated  by  the  incident  X-ray  beam  diffracting  from  the  silicon  crystal  and  the\ndiffracted beam entering  the detector to excite metals in the detector window or detector housing.

Initially,  resistivity  CRMs  or  other  wafers  with\nadequate radial resistivity uniformity (see Section 8.5.1)\nshould be used for this purpose.  As resistivity reference\nwafers    are    prepared,    these    should    be    used    for\nmaintaining    the    control    charts.        After    in-house\nresistivity   reference   wafers   become   available,   it   is\nrecommended that three wafers at each resistivity level\nbe  set  aside  for  control  charting.

In addition to being in control, the\ninstruments   should   return   measured   values   of   the\nresistivity  of  the  CRMs  that  do  not  deviate  from  their\ncertified value by more than the root mean square of the\ntwo-sigma (95 % confidence level estimate) uncertainty\nof  the  CRM  (Note  1)  and  the  two-sigma  instrument\nvariability  determined  by  control  charting  procedures\n(Note 2).  A suggested procedure for control charting of\nCRMs is given in Section R1-3 for use in organizations\nwithout previously established procedures.\nNOTE 1:  A  laboratory  issuing  a  CRM  should  provide  a\ncomprehensive  statement  of  its  uncertainty  associated  with\nthe  measurement  and  reporting  of  the  CRM  value.    This\nshould  include  evaluations,  or  estimates,  of  both  random  and\nsystematic \u201cerrors\u201d following ISO procedures for Type A and\nType B evaluations of components of uncertainty.  The result\nwould  be  expressed  as  a  Combined  Standard  Uncertainty\n(standard  deviation,  or  square-root  of  a  sum  of  variances  of\nuncertainty components), or as an \u201cExpanded Uncertainty\u201d (2\ntimes  the  Combined  Standard  Uncertainty).    If  based  on\nsufficient   statistical   degrees   of   freedom,   the   Combined\nStandard   Uncertainty   is   a   one-sigma   estimate,   and   the\nExpanded  Uncertainty  is  a  two-sigma,  or  95%  confidence-\nlevel,  estimate.    If  there  are  insufficient  statistical  degrees  of\nfreedom,  the  effective  number  of  degrees  of  freedom  should\nbe   reported   by   the   CRM-issuing   laboratory.      It   is   then\nnecessary  to  multiply  the  uncertainty  value  provided  by  the\nstudent-t  factor  appropriate  to  that  number  of  degrees  of\nfreedom  in  order  to  obtain  values  for  the  one-sigma  or  two-\nsigma (95% confidence-level) measurement uncertainty.\nNOTE 2:  A  laboratory  following  this  procedure  to  establish\ntraceability  to  resistivity  CRMs  incorporates  a  value  of  its\nmeasurement    uncertainty    based    on    its    control    chart\nmeasurements,    which    evaluate    random    components    of\nuncertainty  only.    If  the  laboratory  then  measures  a  value  for\nthe  CRM  within  the  total  uncertainty  interval,  calculated\nfollowing  the  root-mean-square  procedure,  above,  about  the\ncertified  value,  its  instrument  is  validated  for  use.    If  it\nmeasures  a  value  outside  the  prescribed  interval,  this  is  an\nindication that its measurement bias with respect to true value\nis  statistically  significant  at  the  95%  level,  and  instrument\nrepair, or \u201ccalibration\u201d is necessary before proceeding.\n7. 1.3  Probe  Assembly  and  Electrical  Equipment  Tests\n\u2014   Should   an   out-of-control   or   out-of-specification\ncondition   be   encountered,   the   probe   assembly   and\nelectrical  equipment  can  be  tested  in  accordance  with\nthe  section  on  Suitability  of  Test  Equipment  in  SEMI\nMF84.

It is generally desirable to qualify a\ncrystal  section  for  the  desired  parameters  and  then\nverify  that  individual  wafers  meet  the  requirements\nduring   the   calibration   procedure.      The   uniformity\nrequirements,   in   particular,   depend   on   the   specific\napplication  of  the  reference  wafers  because  different\nresistivity   measuring   instruments   are   sensitive   to\ndifferent volumes of material.\n8. 1.1\nFour-point  Probes  \u2014  The  most  straightforward\napplication of resistivity reference wafers is for control\nof four-point probes used for measurement of resistivity\nand resistivity variation.  If the wafer under test has the\nsame   geometry   and   surface   characteristics   as   the\nreference wafer and if the same probe geometry is used\nfor the measurement of both the reference wafer and the\nwafer  under  test,  the  transfer  is  direct  and  no  special\nprecautions  need  be  observed.    If  the  wafer  under  test\nhas  different  thickness  or  diameter  from  the  resistivity\nreference  wafer  or  if  four-point  probes  with  different\nprobe-tip  spacings  are  used  to  measure  the  test  and\nreference  wafers,  attention  must  be  paid  to  the  use  of\nthe  appropriate  correction  factors.    In  particular,  if  the\nratio  of  thickness  to  probe-tip  spacing  becomes  too\nlarge,  (Note  3)  while  the  ratio  of  diameter  to  probe-tip\nspacing  becomes  too  small,  second  order  errors  due  to\nthe use of two two-dimensional corrections for a three-\ndimensional geometry may become significant.  Also, if\ndifferent  probe-tip  spacings  are  used,  differences  in\nsampling  volume  must  be  recognized;  in  this  case,\nresistivity  uniformity  of  both  the  reference  wafer  and\nthe wafer under test limits the transfer accuracy.  If the\nwafer  under  test  has  a  different  surface  condition  from\nthat   of   the   reference   wafer,   it   is   necessary   to\ndemonstrate     the     equivalence     of     the     resulting\nmeasurement  value  with  that  which  would  have  been\nobtained had the same surface condition been employed\nfor   both.

Because  the  standard\ntest  method  for  use  of  dual-configuration  four-point\nprobes is intended for sheet resistance, rather than bulk-\nresistivity  measurement,  these  concerns  with  thickness\nand  diameter  issues  can  be  ignored.    However,  if  the\nthickness is too great, an unknown thickness correction\nfactor  must  be  used  if  bulk  resistivity  values  are  to  be\ncompared.\n8. 1.2\nEddy-current    Gages    \u2014    The    eddy-current\ndetector  is  sensitive  to  the  integrated  sheet  resistance\nacross  the  thickness  of  the  wafer;  in  this  respect  it  is\nsimilar  to  the  four-point  probe.    However,  the  eddy-\ncurrent   probe   may   weight   various   elements   of   the\nvolume  sampled  differently  than  that  of  a  four-point\nprobe.  Therefore, the weighted average resistivity seen\nin nonuniform wafers by the eddy current gage may not\nbe the same as the center-point average resistivity value\ndetermined  by  the  four-point  probe.    As  a  result,  the\naccuracy of transfer between these types of instruments\ndepends  strongly  on  the  macro-scale  uniformity  of  the\nresistivity  over  the  central  area  of  the  reference  wafer.\nBecause  the  eddy-current  gage  is  a  bulk  measurement\ndevice,  the  thickness  uniformity  over  the  area  sampled\nby the eddy-current probe is also important.  The upper\nlimit  of  the  expected  reduction  of  transfer  accuracy  is\ngiven as follows:"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"1001\nTTV\n11\nreductionpercent  maximum\n\xd7\n\u23aa\n\u23ad\n\u23aa\n\u23ac\n\u23ab\n\u23aa\n\u23a9\n\u23aa\n\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u2212\n\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u239f\n\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\n\u239d\n\u239b\n+\xd7\n\u239f\n\u239f\n\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\n\u239c\n\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2206\n+=\nw\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n(1)\nwhere:\n\u03c1\n= average   center-\npoint   resistivity   of   resistivity\nreference wafer, corrected to 23\xb0C, in \u2126\xb7cm,\n\u2206\u03c1\n= radial resistivity variation of resistivity reference\nwafer, corrected to 23\xb0C, in \u2126\xb7cm, over the area\nsampled by the eddy-current probe,\nTTV =  total  thickness  variation  of  resistivity  reference\nwafer,  in  \u03bcm,  over  the  area  sampled  by  the\neddy-current probe, and\nw  =  average  thickness  of  resistivity  reference  wafer,\nin \u03bcm.\n8. 1.3\nSpreading   Resistance   Probes   \u2014   Because   the\nspreading  resistance  probe  samples  a  volume  that  is\nexceedingly  small  compared  with  the  volume  sampled\nby  the  four-point  probe,  the  most  critical  reference\nwafer   parameter   for   accurate   transfer   of   resistivity\nvalue   is   the   micro-variation   of   the   resistivity   both\naxially   and   radially.      Very   complex   and   time-\nconsuming  procedures  are  required  to  determine  the\nmicro-scale depth and lateral variations of resistivity in\na   reference   wafer   (see   Sections   8.4.3   and   8.5.2,"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1527-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2004 6\nrespectively).    Further,  the  procedures  for  determining\nmicro-scale depth profiles are destructive and cannot be\ncarried out on the reference wafer itself.  Consequently,\nfor   this   application   crystals   should   be   grown   by\nprocedures  that  result  in  the  best  possible  uniformity.\nThese  include  neutron  transmutation  doping  of  very\nhigh   purity   FZ   crystals   to   obtain   high   resistivity\n(neutron  transmutation  doped  (NTD))\nn-type  wafers\nand magnetic Czochralski (MCz) growth of crystals for\nboth\nn- and p-type wafers.\n8. 1.4\nMercury  Probes  \u2014  Similar  conditions  exist  for\nreference wafers intended for calibration and control of\nmercury  probe  systems  that  are  primarily  used  for\ndetermining  the  net  carrier  density  of  epitaxial  layers\nfrom capacitance measurements.  Such probes sample a\nlateral area much smaller than the four-point probe and\na  depth  that  is  only  a  very  tiny  fraction  of  the  wafer\nthickness.    To  ensure  that  the  resistivity  in  the  region\nsampled  by  the  mercury  probe  can  be  taken  as  the\nresistivity   measured   by   the   four-point   probe,   it   is\nnecessary  to  establish  that  both  the  macro-  and  micro-\nscale variations in resistivity of the reference wafer are\nwithin  tolerable  limits.    Thus,  it  is  desirable  to  use\nhighly uniform crystal such as NTD FZ or MCz crystal\nfor  resistivity  reference  wafers  for  this  application  (see\nSection  8.1.3).    It  is  further  required  in  this  case  to\nestablish  the  net  carrier  density  of  the  reference  wafer\nfrom the resistivity measurement (see Section 9.2.4).\n8. 2\nResistivity \u2014  The  center-point  resistivity  of  the\nreference    wafer    should    be    chosen    to    meet    the\nrequirements   of   the   measuring   instrument   to   be\ncalibrated or controlled.  Most of the test methods cited\nin   Section   1.2   specify   the   resistivity   range   of   the\nrequired resistivity reference wafers.\n8. 2.1\nFour-point     Probes     \u2014     For     control     of\ninstrumentation  for  making  four-point  probe  resistivity\nmeasurements  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF84,  it  is\nrecommended   that   a   minimum   of   three   resistivity\nreference  wafers,  with  resistivity  values  in  the  upper,\nmiddle,  and  lower  portions  of  the  resistivity  range  of\ninterest  be  used  (Note  4).    It  is  preferable  to  use  more\nclosely  spaced  resistivity  reference  wafers  to  ensure\ninstrument linearity over the entire measurement range.\nIf only a narrow resistivity range (less than \xb125% of the\nnominal value) needs to be measured, it is sufficient to\nuse  two  resistivity  reference  wafers  at  the  extremes  of\nthis  range.    Similar  considerations  apply  for  control  of\ninstrumentation      for      making      sheet      resistance\nmeasurements   in   accordance   with   SEMI   MF1529,\nexcept  that,  in  this  case,  of  course,  the  parameter  of\ninterest is the sheet resistance rather than the resistivity.\nNOTE 4:  For  control  of  instrumentation  for  making  four-\npoint  probe  measurements  over  a  narrow  resistivity  range,  it\nmay   be   appropriate   to   use   only   one   or   two   resistivity\nreference wafers.\n8. 2.2  Eddy\u2013Current  Gages  \u2014  For  calibration  of  eddy\ncurrent resistivity measuring instruments, SEMI MF673\nspecifies that for calibration by Method I, five reference\nwafers   that   span   the   full   resistivity   range   of   the\ninstrument are required.  However, many organizations\nprefer  to  use  many  more  reference  wafers  for  the\nMethod  I  calibration.    Two  resistivity  reference  wafers\nat  the  extremes  of  a  narrow  resistivity  range  (typically\nless   than   about   \xb125   %   of   the   nominal   value)   are\nrequired for Method II calibration.\n8. 2.3\nSpreading  Resistance  Probes  \u2014  For  calibration\nof   spreading   resistance   equipment,   SEMI   MF672\nrecommends  use  of  at  least  three  resistivity  reference\nwafers  per  decade  over  the  range  of  resistivity  to  be\nmeasured.  Regular spacing is desirable, but it may not\nbe possible to secure samples with adequate uniformity\nwith  arbitrary  nominal  resistivity  values.    Selection  of\nsamples    for    micro-scale    uniformity    should    take\nprecedence over regular spacing.\n8. 2.4\nMercury Probes \u2014 The resistivity of a resistivity\nreference wafer intended for use in calibrating mercury\nprobe    systems    for    making    net    carrier    density\nmeasurements  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF1392  or\nSEMI MF1393 is specified to be between one-half and\ntwo   times   the   resistivity   of   the   specimens   to   be\nmeasured.    However,  there  is  some  benefit  to  employ\nseveral  resistivity  reference  wafers  with  a  range  of\nresistivity  from  very  high  (net  carrier  density  less  than\nabout   1   \xd7   10\n14\ncm\n\u22123\n)   to   the   lowest   value   to   be\nmeasured.\n8. 3\nWafer Diameter \u2014 Resistivity reference wafers do\nnot  need  to  be  the  same  diameter  as  the  wafers  to  be\nmeasured  by  the  system;  any  diameter  that  fits  the\ninstrumentation and its associated wafer handling is, in\nprinciple,  acceptable.    However,  advances  in  crystal\ngrowing design and control together with certain aspect\nratio  considerations  make  it  likely  that  superior  radial\nresistivity  uniformity  in  the  central  region  of  the  wafer\ncan be obtained with larger diameter (\u2265100 mm) wafers\nas  compared  to  that  of  smaller  diameter  wafers.    In\naddition,  the  diameter  correction  factor  for  wafers  100\nmm  in  diameter  and  larger  measured  with  a  four-point\nprobe with probe-tip spacing of 1.59 mm is within 0.2%\nof     its     limiting     value     of     \u03c0/ln2 ( = 4.5324).\nConsequently, errors due to small variations in diameter\nor  probe  placement  at  the  wafer  center  are  negligibly\nsmall (see Section R2-3.1), and the second order errors\nassociated  with  the  combination  of  the  thickness  and\ndiameter  correction  factors  can  also  be  neglected.    The\nlatter  point  is  particularly  significant  when  four-point\nprobes  with  small  probe-tip  spacings  are  employed  on\nstandard    thickness    wafers    because    the    thickness"))}d.isMDXComponent=!0},5680(e,n,t){t.d(n,{xA:()=>h,yg:()=>u});var a=t(6540);function i(e,n,t){return n in e?Object.defineProperty(e,n,{value:t,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[n]=t,e}function r(e,n){var t=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var a=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);n&&(a=a.filter(function(n){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,n).enumerable})),t.push.apply(t,a)}return t}function o(e){for(var n=1;n<arguments.length;n++){var t=null!=arguments[n]?arguments[n]:{};n%2?r(Object(t),!0).forEach(function(n){i(e,n,t[n])}):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(t)):r(Object(t)).forEach(function(n){Object.defineProperty(e,n,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(t,n))})}return e}function s(e,n){if(null==e)return{};var t,a,i=function(e,n){if(null==e)return{};var t,a,i={},r=Object.keys(e);for(a=0;a<r.length;a++)t=r[a],n.indexOf(t)>=0||(i[t]=e[t]);return i}(e,n);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var r=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(a=0;a<r.length;a++)t=r[a],n.indexOf(t)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,t)&&(i[t]=e[t])}return i}var c=a.createContext({}),l=function(e){var n=a.useContext(c),t=n;return e&&(t="function"==typeof e?e(n):o(o({},n),e)),t},h=function(e){var n=l(e.components);return a.createElement(c.Provider,{value:n},e.children)},d={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var n=e.children;return a.createElement(a.Fragment,{},n)}},m=a.forwardRef(function(e,n){var t=e.components,i=e.mdxType,r=e.originalType,c=e.parentName,h=s(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),m=l(t),u=i,f=m["".concat(c,".").concat(u)]||m[u]||d[u]||r;return t?a.createElement(f,o(o({ref:n},h),{},{components:t})):a.createElement(f,o({ref:n},h))});function u(e,n){var t=arguments,i=n&&n.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||i){var r=t.length,o=new Array(r);o[0]=m;var s={};for(var c in n)hasOwnProperty.call(n,c)&&(s[c]=n[c]);s.originalType=e,s.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:i,o[1]=s;for(var l=2;l<r;l++)o[l]=t[l];return a.createElement.apply(null,o)}return a.createElement.apply(null,t)}m.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
