RELATED INFORMATION 1
NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI D12 and is not intended to modify or supercede
the  official  standard.  Rather,  this  note  describes  methods  for  producing  FPD  substrate  edges  which  may  be  under
development. Publication was authorized by full letter ballot procedures.
R1-1  Current Practice
R1-1.1      The   edges   of   FPD   substrates   are   modified
during  the  substrate  manufacturing  process  so  that,  in
subsequent    panel    processing,    operator    safety    is
improved   and   particulate   generation   is   minimized.
Currently, a “chamfered edge” process is in general use.
This modifies the two “corners” of each edge as shown
in Figure 1.
R1-2  Future Developments
R1-2.1        Other    edge    treatments    may    prove    more
efficient,  and  several  alternate  approaches  are  under
development. Two of these are a “Radiused Edge” and
“Rounded Edge,” shown in Figures R1-1 and R1-2. The
radiused  edge  initially  appears  simple,  but  appropriate
values  of  R,  for  various  substrate  thicknesses  (T),  are
being examined for manufacturability. For cases where
R > T, the proper “edge blend,” where R intercepts the
substrate pattern and back surfaces, may prove difficult
to define and control.

These  specifications  were  technically  approved  by  the  Committee  and  are  the  direct  responsibility  of  the
Japanese  FPD  Materials  and  Components  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  Japanese  Regional
Standards Committee on April 19, 2001.  Initially available at www.semi.org August 2001; to be published
November 2001. This document was originally published in 1995.
1  Purpose
1. 1    These   terms   and   definitions   de scribe   various
elements  and  characteristics  of  FPD  color  filter  (CF)
assemblies.    They  are  intended  to  assist  in  future  CF
standardization activity.
2  Scope
2. 1  Color filters comprise the fron t plate assembly in a
colored flat panel display. They consist of a number of
material layers such as glass substrate, color filter layer,
black  matrix,  overcoat  layer,  and  Indium  Tin  Oxide
(ITO) films. Each of these layers has various properties
which  may  need  to  be  specified,  produced,  controlled,
and characterized. This document provides an overview
of  these  layers,  with  terms  and  definitions  for  selected
elements,  and  indicates  the  appearance  of  some  color
filter   defects.   This   document   may   be   useful   in
developing  material  specifications,  inspection  criteria,
and test methods.
2. 2   This  standard  does  not  purport   to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.   It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1     This    document    does    not    contai n    detailed
measuring  and  test  methods.  Such  methods  may  be
developed  separately,  and  references  to  them  may  be
incorporated  into  color  filter  specification  documents
where  appropriate.  The  assembly  of  color  filters  into  a
flat panel display assembly is not covered herein.

FPD GLASS SUBSTRATE SURFACE WAVINESS MEASUREMENT
METHOD
This  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Flat  Panel  Display  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  Japanese  FPD  Materials  and  Components  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the
Japanese Regional Standards Committee on April 28, 2003.  Initially available at www.semi.org June 2003;
to be published July 2003. Originally published December 1996.

glass    substrate    surface    waviness    by    measuring
instruments    employing    mechanical    stylus,    optical
stylus,    and    optical    interferometric    measurement
methods.
2  Scope

4  Terminology
4. 1  Definitions
4. 1.1  2CR filter — a profile filter equivalent to a series
of two CR filter circuits (see ISO 3274).
4. 1.1.1  The  standard  transmission  coefficients  at  cut-
off wavelength are 75%.
4. 1.2  bandpass  filtered  waviness  profile  —  a  profile
obtained   by   removing   the   long   wavelength   form
components      and      short      wavelength      roughness
components from a sampled real profile (see Figure 2).
4. 1.3  evaluation  length,  L
e
ó  the  length  of  the  profile
used    for    assessing    the    waviness    profile    under
evaluation. A traced length after deduction of both pre-
travel and post-travel.
4. 1.4  FPD  waviness,  W
fpd
ó  moving  minimum  zone
method  straightness  of  waviness.  The  maximum  value
of  a  minimum  zone  method  straightness  of  a  certain
sampling   length   within   an   evaluation   length.   An
approximation in Appendix 1 can be used as well.
4. 1.4.1  Discussion  ó  In  fact,  it  takes  a  long  time  to
calculate W
fpd
by the above method because of too large
a  number  of  sampling  lengths  which  are  all  sampled
data  points  within  evaluation  length  minus  the  number
of data points within a sampling length.
4. 1.4.2    Therefore,  is  recommended  that  the  computer
approximation method described in Appendix 1 be used
to save time.
4. 1.4.3      Another   manual   evaluation   method   is   the
following:

# 1

1.   Prepare  the  template  which  has  a  sampling  length
width window.

# 2

2.   Scan   the   template   with   fitting   properly   on   the
recorded chart of bandpass-filtered waviness profile
through the evaluation length.

# 3

3.  Read out every straightness of the profile within the
window of the template on every fitted position.

# 4

4.   The maximum value of all of the readings is W
fpd
.

the   attenuation   ratio   of   its   amplitude   becomes   a
standard value when the traced profile is passed through
the  high-pass  wavelength  filter  which  eliminates  form
element.
4. 1.6  minimum    zone    method    straightness    ó    the
smallest  distance  between  two  parallel  straight  lines

irregularities  of  a  target,  from  the  distribution  of  light
intensity   of   laser   interferometer   between   the   target
surface and datum flat.
4. 1.8  optical  stylus  method  measuring  instrument  —
instrument  that  uses  the  same  profile  method  that  a
stylus method instrument uses. This instrument uses the
displacement  transducer  to  apply  the  spotlight  to  the
target  surface  instead  of  using  the  stylus  to  apply  the
spotlight.
4. 1.9  phase  correct  filter  —  a  profile  filter  which  does
not cause phase shifts between total profile and filtered
profile.

distortion  caused  by  transient  response  of  the  cut-off
filter.
4. 1.10.1    Recommended  pre-travel  with  2CR  filter  is
double the long wavelength cut-off, λ

with   phase   correct   filter   are   the   same   as   long
wavelength cut-off, λ
L
.
4. 1.11  real profile — An intersection of a target surface
with a plane perpendicular to the surface (see Figure 2).
4. 1.12  sampling  length,  L
s
—  the  length  of  the  profile
for calculations of waviness parameters in an evaluation
length (L

c
—  wavelength  that
the   attenuation   ratio   of   its   amplitude   becomes   a
standard value when the traced profile is passed through
the    low-pass    wavelength    filter    which    eliminates
roughness element.
4. 1.14  streak   —   a   defect   whose   appearance   is   a
transparent  line  on  the  glass  substrate  surface.  It  can
either  be  caused  by  a  micro  surface  discontinuity  or  a
cord due to the heterogeneity of glass composition.
4. 1.15  stylus     method     measuring     instrument     —
instrument  that  traces  on  a  section  of  a  surface  by  a
stylus, records irregularity on the surface in an enlarged
form,  and  indicates  its  amplitude  as  parameters  (see
ISO 3274).
4. 1.16  traced length — total traversing length of stylus
or spotlight.
4. 1.17  waviness — components of surface irregularities
with   spatial   wavelength   intermediate   between   long
wavelength (flatness) and short wavelength (roughness)
(see Figure 2).
4. 1.17.1  Discussion  ó  Especially  on  FPD  substrates,
those components cause visual irregularity of the shade
of the panel due to deviations of the cell gap.
4. 1.17.2  Waviness includes not only periodic waviness,
but also streaks.
5  Measuring Instrument
5. 1  Method  —  Stylus  method  measuring  instrument,
optical   stylus   instrument,   or   optical   interferometric
flatness measuring instrument.
5. 2  Stylus or Spotlight
5. 2.1  Shape ó circular cone or sphere
5. 2.2  Tip Radius ó from 2μm to 0.8 mm (0.03 inch)
5. 2.3  Spotlight  Diameter  of  Optical  Stylus  Method  ó

5. 4  Sampling Interval — 0.2 mm (0.0079 inch) or less
5. 5  Profile Filter — 2CR filter or phase correct filter
5. 5.1  Discussion  ó  The  filtering  method  should  be
specified  because  the  evaluated  value  of  W

SEMI D16-0998
SPECIFICATION FOR MECHANICAL INTERFACE BETWEEN FLAT
PANEL DISPLAY MATERIAL HANDLING SYSTEM AND TOOL PORT
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Flat  Panel  Display  Equipment  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Flat  Panel  Display  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Stadards  Committee  July  1998.  Published  on  SEMI  OnLine  September  1998;  print  version
published September 1998.
1  Purpose
1. 1   This  specification  defines  featu re  requirements  on
and   about   tool   ports   of   process   tools   used   in
manufacturing  of  flat  panel  displays.  These  feature
requirements   facilitate   the   interfacing   of   transport
equipment   to   the   tool   by   standardizing   the   feature
requirements.  Such  standards  are  intended  to  promote
cost-effective  interfacing  while  preserving  freedom  of
choice in material handling equipment.
2  Scope
2. 1   These  standards  define  mechan ical  features  on  or
about the process tool port, and in front of or on the tool
face.  Although  these  features  are  intended  for  specific
functions,  they  do  not  set  design  requirements  for  any
particular  functionality.  The  interface  requirements  are
meant to be universal and to avoid the promotion of any
particular  form  of  transport.  Therefore,  they  are  useful
for the interfacing of continuous direct WIP transports,
such  as  conveyors,  or  discrete  vehicles  of  foreseeable
future  design,  such  as  AGVs,  to  the  process  tool  port.
The  dimensions  incorporated  in  the  standard  apply  to
single panel handling as well as substrate carriers.
3  Limitations
3. 1    Current   display   manufacturing    utilizes   several
substrate  sizes,  many  of  them  “non-standard.”  This
proposed  interface  specification  includes  dimensions
for the substrate sizes of 550 × 650 mm, and 600 × 720
mm   and   anticipates   the   establishment   of   standard
dimension  in  future  substrate  sizes.    For  these  future
substrate sizes, a universal dimensioning method based
on substrate size may be possible.

the  front  face  of  the  tool  and  perpendicular  to  the
horizontal and vertical datum planes.
5. 1.2   horizontal  datum  plane  —  the   plane  coincident
with  the  top  surface  of  the  floor  and  perpendicular  to
the facial datum plane of the tool.

and tool face when the substrate is delivered to the tool
port; ± 10 mm.
5. 2.5  Y3 — depth of the exclusion z one used for PGV
cart alignment devices; maximum.
5. 2.6   Y4  —  overhead  exclusion  zone   for  ceiling-hung
material delivery systems; maximum.
5. 2.7   Y5  —  maximum  protrusion  fro m  tool  port.  May
be used for mounting docking devices (mostly PGVs).
5. 2.8  Z1 — height of tool port; ± 10  mm (load plane of
reference).
5. 2.9   Z2  —  the  lowest  point  on  an  o verhead  delivery
system; minimum.
5. 2.10   Z3   —   the   maximum   volume   h eight   of   an

6. 2   Centerline  location  of  the  subs trate,  as  it  is  delivered  by  the  material  handling  equipment,  with  respect  to  the
tool  face  may  not  coincide  with  the  centerline  location  of  the  substrate  when  the  latter  is  finally  positioned  on  the
tool port for substrate handling.
6. 3  Substrate delivery is to be hori zontal, active (pattern) face up.
6. 4  The single substrate or carrier  is to have a horizontal loading orientation with shorter side parallel to the tool
face plane.
6. 5  Load height of the single subst rate or carrier shall be adjustable on the material handling system within 20 (±
10) mm of the nominal height.
6. 6   There  should  be  no  obstruction   between  the  load  port  and  the  material  delivery  system  within  the  defined
adjustable range of the load port height.
6. 7   Load  and  unload  mechanisms   must  allow  operator-assisted  loading.  This  implies  clearance  space  for  the
operator, as well as mechanisms that allow manual override.

nominal substrate seating planes.
6  Requirements
6. 1  Physical Protection of Substra te
6. 1.1   No  chipping,  scratching,  or  oth er  damage  shall
occur under normal handling and shipping conditions.
6. 1.2   Substrates  shall  be  contained  t o  prevent  excess
movement during shipment.
6. 2    Provisions   for   Tracking   and   Id entification —
Provision for a printed label should be made.
6. 3   Thermal  Requirements  —  Con struction  materials
shall    withstand    cleaning    temperatures    of    90ºC,
following which the cassette shall meet the dimensional
and other requirements of this specification.
6. 4  Loading/Unloading of Substra tes
6. 4.1   Cassettes  furnished  to  this  spe cification  must  be
compatible    with    manual    and    automated    loading/
unloading systems, while minimizing cassette volume.
6. 4.2   Such  cassettes  must  also  facili tate  transfer  of
substrates  to  and  from,  a  Transportation/Automation
Cassette.
6. 5   Cassette  Physical  Alignment  In terface  —  The
cassette should be registered to the tool interface by one
of  the  three  following  registration  types,  A,  B,  or  C.
The  locations  of  the  registration  features  have  been
chosen  such  that  all  three  types  may  coexist  on  the
same cassette.
6. 5.1  Cassette Physical Alignment In terface Type A —
This  interface  consists  of  three  features  (not  specified,
but  recommended  to  be  inverted  V-shaped  grooves)
placed  on  the  bottom  of  the  cassette  that  mate  with
three  coupling  pins  located  on  the  tool  interface.  The
coupling  pins  are  located  by  dimensions  x14  and  y13
relative   to   the   bilateral   and   facial   datum   planes
respectively.
6. 5.1.1  Coupling    Pin    Shapes    —    The    p hysical
alignment   mechanism   on   the   bottom   of   the   wafer
carrier   consists   of   features   (not   specified   in   this
standard)  that  mate  with  three  pins  underneath.  As
shown  in  Figure  5  and  defined  in  Table  3,  each  pin  is
radially  symmetric  about  the  vertical  center  axis  line
and  can  be  seen  as  the  intersection  of  a  cylinder  of
diameter  d1  and  a  sphere  of  radius  r3  (which  might
contact  a  flat  plate).  An  additional  rounding  radius  r5
provides contact with angled mating surfaces, and blend
radii  r4  and  r6  smooth  the  resulting  edges.  The  final
roughness  height  of  the  overall  surface  finish  must  be
less  than  or  equal  to  r7.  Dimensions  r2  and  z13  have
zero  tolerance  because  they  only  give  a  distance  to
another     toleranced     dimension.     (Dimensions     in
parenthesis  are  not  part  of  the  requirements  in  this
standard  but  are  intended  to  clarify  the  preparation  of
manufacturing instructions.)
6. 5.1.2  The three features on the botto m of the cassette
that mate with the coupling pins must provide a lead-in
capability that corrects a cassette misalignment of up to
10 mm (0.4 in.) in any horizontal direction, although 15
mm (0.6 in.) is recommended. The exclusion zones for
the three coupling features on the cassette are shown in
Figure 3 and Table 1 and specified by dimensions x14,
z9 and r1.
6. 5.2  Cassette Physical Alignment In terface Type B —
This  interface  consists  of  three  features,  a  v-rail,  float
surface, and facial datum plane v-groove. The v-rail and

SEMI D17-0200 © SEMI 1998, 20003
float  surface  are  located  on  the  bottom  of  the  cassette
and  mate  with  the  two  v-rail  rollers  and  one  float
surface   roller,   respectively,   mounted   on   the   tool
interface.  The  facial  datum  plane  v-groove  is  located
about the facial datum plane through the bottom surface
of  the  cassette  and  mates  with  the  facial  datum  plane
lock pin located on the tool interface shown in Figure 3.
The v-rail roller and the float surface roller are located
by  dimensions  x15  and  x16  relative  to  the  bilateral
datum  plane,  respectively,  shown  in  Figure  6.  The
dimensiona relative to the facial datum plane for the v-
rail  rollers  are  not  specified  but  recommended  to  be
located  furthest  from  and  symmetrical  about  the  facial
datum  plane  as  shown  in  Figures  3  and  6.  The  float
surface roller revolute axis must lie on the facial datum
plane.
6. 5.2.1  The v-rail and float surface rol lers are defined
in   Figure   7   and   Table   4.   Each   roller   is   radially
symmetric   about   the   revolute   axis.   The   rollers   are
circumferentially    radiused    of    dimension    r8.    The
diameter   of   the   rollers   is   not   specified,   but   the
tangential  surface  created  by  dimension  r8  must  lie  on
the horizontal datum plane. The facial datum plane lock
pin radius is equal to r8 and must be positioned into the
facial   datum   plane   v-groove   to   fully   constrain   the
cassette  to  the  facial  datum  plane.  The  facial  datum
plane lock pin is translated out of the facial datum plane
v-groove to allow the cassette to be rolled in and out of
the   tool   interface.   Although   only   three   rollers   are
specified,   it   is   recommended   to   increase   the   total
number of rollers so that the cassette is fully supported
while  being  loaded  and  unloaded  to  the  tool  interface.
All rollers, except for the v-rail and float roller, must be
positioned  so  that  the  tangent  of  the  r8  dimension  lies
below the horizontal datum plane.
6. 5.2.2  The three features on the botto m of the cassette
that  mate  with  the  rollers  and  lock  pin  must  provide  a
lead-in  capability  that  corrects  a  cassette  misalignment
of  up  to  10  mm  (0.4  in.)  in  any  horizontal  direction,
although  15  mm  (0.6  in.)  is  recommended.  The  v-rail
and  facial  datum  plane  v-groove  are  not  specified  but
recommended  to  be  inverted  v-shaped  grooves.  The  v-
rail  is  recommended  to  extend  the  full  length  of  the
cassette from the cassette front to the cassette rear. The
float  surface  is  not  specified  but  recommended  to  be  a
flat  surface  extending  the  full  length  of  the  cassette
from   the   cassette   front   to   the   cassette   rear.   The
exclusion zones for these features are shown in Figures
3  and  6  and  specified  by  dimensions  x15  and  x16
through x22.
6. 5.3  Cassette Physical Alignment In terface Type C —
To be developed.
6. 6    Conveyor   Rails   —   If   the   casse tte   is   to   be
transported  on  roller  conveyors,  each  conveyor  rail
should  extend  the  maximum  distance  from  front  to
back. The exclusion zones for conveyor rails are shown
in Figures 3 and 6 and specified by dimensions x13 and
x22 and extend to the outer boundary of the cassette.
6. 7   Conveying  Surface  —  If  the  ca ssette  is  to  be
transported  on  roller  conveyors  that  support  the  entire
bottom of the cassette, the bottom surface excluding the
v-rail,  v-groove,  and  float  roller  zones  is  to  be  used.
The   location   of   this   surface   with   respect   to   the
horizontal datum plane is specified by dimension z3.
6. 8   Substrate  Orientation  —  The  s ubstrates  must  be
horizontal when the carrier is placed on the coupling.
6. 9   Cassette  Sides  and  Rear  —  Fig ure  2  shows  a  top
view  of  the  boundaries  of  the  cassette  side  domains
(which  contain  the  parts  of  the  cassette  higher  than  z4
above  the  horizontal  datum  plane  and  lower  than  z9
above the top substrate). Table 1 defines the dimensions
shown in this and following figures.
6. 10   Cassette  Top  —  The  boundari es  of  the  cassette
top  domain  contain  any  part  of  the  cassette  hither  than
z9 above the top substrate.
6. 11   Cassette  Bottom  —  Figure  3  sh ows  a  bottom
view  of  the  boundaries  of  the  cassette  bottom  domain
(which  contains  any  part  of  the  cassette  lower  than  z4
above the horizontal datum plane). When the cassette is
fully  down,  the  cassette  placement  sensing  pads  must
be z2 above the horizontal datum plane.
6. 12  Vertical Dimensions
6. 12.1   Figure  4  shows  the  vertical  dim ensions  of  the
left  half  of  the  cassette  as  viewed  from  the  rear.  Note
that  z5  (the  height  of  the  bottom  nominal  substrate
seating plane above the horizontal datum plane) and z8
(the   distance   between   adjacent   nominal   substrate
seating  planes)  are  given  as  reference  dimensions  with
no  tolerance.  This  means  that  the  sum  of  actual  height
variations  in  the  cassette  from  the  horizontal  datum
plane  to  the  mizo  tooth  or  slot  holding  each  substrate
must  be  contained  within  the  tolerance  of  z6  with  no
further stack-up at each higher substrate.
6. 12.2   The  open  space  for  the  substra te  extraction
volume  is  indicated  by  dimensions  x6  and  y7  and  is
symmetric  about  the  bilateral  and  facial  datum  planes,
respectively.  The  top  of  the  extraction  volume  is  z7
above   the   nominal   substrate   seating   plane   and   its
bottom is half of the minimum z7 dimension above the
nominal substrate seating plane. The cassette must give
extra  horizontal  clearance  once  the  substrate  is  picked
up  from  wherever  it  ends  up  (within  the  bounds  of  the
substrate pick-up volume) after transport in the cassette.
6. 12.3   The  open  space  for  the  substra te  set-down
volume  is  indicated  by  dimensions  x5  and  y6  and  is

SEMI D17-0200 © SEMI 1998, 20004
symmetric  about  the  bilateral  and  facial  datum  planes,
respectively. The top of this volume is half of z7 above
the nominal substrate seating plane and its bottom is z6
above    the    nominal    substrate    seating    plane.    The
substrate  should  be  placed  within  the  bounds  of  the
substrate  set-down  volume  to  avoid  touching  the  edge
of the substrate to the side of the cassette.
6. 12.4  The substrate pickup zone is d efined by an area
indicated  by  dimensions  x5  and  y5  and  is  symmetric
about     the     bilateral     and     facial     datum     planes,
respectively. Its top and bottom are the upper and lower
tolerance  of  z6  around  the  nominal  substrate  seating
plane. If a substrate is placed in the substrate set-down
volume  and  is  then  pushed  to  the  rear  of  the  cassette,
then   the   entire   bottom   of   the   substrate   must   be
contained in the substrate pick-up zone.
6. 13  Particle Generation — The ca ssette will not add
more  than  0.05  particles/cm
2
of  a  size  ≥  0.5  μm  (PSL
equivalent)  per  substrate  pass  per  shipping  cycle.  The
shipping cycle is to be defined by the customer.
6. 14   Inner  and  Outer  Radii  —  All  c oncave  features
may have as much as a 1 mm (0.04 in.) radius to allow
for  cleaning  and  to  prevent  contaminant  build-up.  All
required  convex  features  (such  as  the  robotic  handling
flanges  and  the  corners  of  the  cassette  top  and  bottom
domains)  must  also  have  a  minimum  radius  of  1  mm
(0.04 in.) to prevent large stress contacts of the cassette
that might cause wear and particles.
6. 15   Dimensional  Tolerances  —  W idth  (W),  Length
(L), and Height (H): ± 5 mm
6. 16  Special Design Features
6. 16.1  Compatible with automated cl eaning tools.
6. 16.2    External   features   that   are   comp atible   with
material  handling  systems  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,
Guided Vehicles, Stocker, and Conveyors.

APPENDIX 1
NOTE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  D17  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot  procedures  on
December  15,  1999  by  the  North  American  Regional  Standards  Committee.    Determination  of  the  suitability  of  the  material
herein is solely the responsibility of the user.
A1-1  Application Notes
A1-1.1  The shape of the teeth holding the substrates is not specified in this standard. The tooth surface that touches
the substrate should have a large radius to minimize stress on the substrate and tooth.
A1-1.2    Extra  clearance  (larger  than  the  pitch)  has  been  added  below  the  bottom  substrate  (for  non-random
sequential access to the substrates with a faster or less precise robot). To increase the stability of Type A Cassettes,
the  points  on  the  cassette  bottom  that  are  the  most  distant  from  the  lines  connecting  each  pair  of  coupling  pins
should be made as close as practical to the horizontal datum plane so that the cassette cannot tip very far off of the
kinematic coupling.
NOTICE:    SEMI  makes  no  warranties  or  representations  as  to  the  suitability  of  the  standards  set  forth  herein  for
any particular application. The determination of the suitability of the standard is solely the responsibility of the user.
Users  are  cautioned  to  refer  to  manufacturer’s  instructions,  product  labels,  product  data  sheets,  and  other  relevant

SPECIFICATION FOR CASSETTES USED FOR HORIZONTAL
TRANSPORT AND STORAGE OF FLAT PANEL DISPLAY
SUBSTRATES
This specification was technically approved by the Flat Panel Display Equipment Committee and is the direct
responsibility of the North American Flat Panel Display Committee.  Current edition approved by the North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  15,  1998.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org
September 1998; to be published February 1999.

This document was editorially modified in October 2000 to correct a formatting error. Changes were made
to Figure 5.
1  Purpose
1. 1    This   standard   specifies   the   cas settes   used   to
horizontally  transport  and  store  glass  substrates  0.7
mm-1.1  mm  thick  (max)  in  a  flat  panel  display  (FPD)
manufacturing facility.
2  Scope
2. 1   This  standard  is  intended  to  se t  an  appropriate
level  of  specification  that  places  minimal  limits  on
innovation    while    ensuring    modularity    and    inter-
changeability  at  all  mechanical  interfaces.  Most  of  the
requirements given in this specification are in the form
of    algebraic    expressions    defining    maximum    or
minimum  dimensions  referenced  from  the  length  and
width  of  the  intended  substrate  with  very  few  required
surfaces.  Only  the  mechanical  interfaces  for  cassettes
are   specified;   no   materials   requirements   or   micro-
contamination  limits  are  given.  However,  this  standard
has been written so that cassettes of various designs and
materials can be manufactured in conformance with it.

5  Ordering Information
5. 1  Intended  Use  —  This  standard   is  intended  to
specify  cassettes  over  a  reasonable  lifetime  of  use,  not
just  those  in  new  condition.  The  purchaser  needs  to
specify  the  time  period,  the  number  of  cycles  and  any
special   conditions   to   which   the   cassettes   will   be
exposed.  It  is  under  these  conditions  that  the  cassettes
must remain in compliance with the requirements listed
in Section 6.
5. 2  Temperature   Ranges   —   The   p urchase   of   the
cassettes  needs  to  specify  three  sets  of  temperatures  to
which  the  cassettes  might  be  exposed.  An  operating
temperature    range    is    the    set    of    environmental
temperatures   in   which   the   cassettes   will   remain   in
compliance  with  the  requirements  listed  in  Section  6
(e.g.  23°C  ±  5°C).  A  temporary  temperature  range  is
the  set  of  environmental  temperatures  to  which  the
cassettes  can  be  exposed  such  that  when  the  cassettes
return  to  the  operating  temperature  range,  the  cassettes
will  be  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  listed  in
Section  6  (e.g.  90°C  maximum  during  cleaning  of  the
cassette).  Also,  the  purchaser  needs  to  specify  a  range
of temperatures for the substrates that might be inserted
in the cassettes.
5. 3  Pitch  and  Capacity  Options  —   T he  purchaser
needs to specify the pitch and capacity of the cassettes.
Table  2  provides  two  options  of  pitch  and  capacity.
Additional   pitch   and   capacity   options   are   not   yet
defined, but should be specified in the same manner.
5. 4  Material  —  To  be  agreed  upon   between  supplier
and  user.  Construction  may  be  of  one  or  more  molded
or machines parts.
6  Requirements
6. 1  Dimensions  —  Most  of  the  dim ensions  of  the
cassette   are   determined   with   respect   to   the   three
orthogonal  datum  planes  defined  in  that  standard:  the
horizontal datum plane, the facial datum plane, and the
bilateral datum plane (see Figure 1).
6. 2  Cassette  Physical  Alignment  In terface  —  The
cassette should be registered to the tool interface by one
of the three following types of registrations (Type A, B
or  C).  The  locations  of  the  registration  features  have
been chosen such that all three types may coexist on the
same cassette
6. 2.1  Cassette Physical Alignment In terface-Type A —
This    registration    consists    of    three    features    (not
specified,  but  recommended  to  be  inverted  V-shaped

SEMI D18-0299
E

grooves) placed on the bottom of the cassette that mate
with  three  coupling  pins  located  on  the  tool  interface.
The  coupling  pins  are  located  by  dimensions x14  and
y13  relative  to  the  bilateral  and  facial  datum  planes
respectively.
6. 2.1.1  Coupling    Pin    Shapes    —    The    p hysical
alignment   mechanism   on   the   bottom   of   the   wafer
carrier   consists   of   features   (not   specified   in   this
standard)  that  mate  with  three  pins  underneath.  As
shown  in  Figure  5  and  defined  in  Table  3,  each  pin  is
radially  symmetric  about  the  vertical  center  axis  line
and  can  be  seen  as  the  intersection  of  a  cylinder  of
diameter d1  and  a  sphere  of  radius r3  (which  might
contact  a  flat  plate).    An  additional  rounding  radius r5
provides contact with angled mating surfaces, and blend
radii r4  and r6  smooth  the  resulting  edges.    The  final
roughness  height  of  the  over-all  surface  finish  must  be
less  than  or  equal  to r7.    Dimensions r2  and z13  have
zero  tolerance  because  they  only  give  a  distance  to
another    toleranced    dimension.        (Dimensions    in
parenthesis  are  not  part  of  the  requirements  in  this
standard  but  are  intended  to  clarify  the  preparation  of
manufacturing instructions.)
6. 2.1.2  The three features on the botto m of the cassette
that mate with the coupling pins must provide a lead-in
capability that corrects a cassette misalignment of up to
10 mm (0.4 in.) in any horizontal direction, although 15
mm (0.6 in.) is recommended. The exclusion zones for
the  three  coupling  features  on  the  cassette  is  shown  in
Figure 3 and Table 1 and specified by dimensions x14,
z9 and r1.
6. 2.2  Cassette Physical Alignment In terface-Type B —
Consists  of  three  features,  a  V-rail,  float  surface,  and
facial  datum  plane  V-groove.  The  V-rail  and  float
surface  are  located  on  the  bottom  of  the  cassette  and
mate  with  the  two  V-rail  rollers  and  one  float  surface
roller,  respectively,  mounted  on  the  tool  interface.  The
facial datum plane V-groove is located about the facial
datum plane through the bottom surface of the cassette
and  mates  with  the  facial  datum  plane  lock  pin  located
on  the  tool  interface  shown  in  Figure  3.  The  V-rail
roller   and   the   float   surface   roller   are   located   by
dimensions x15  and x16  relative  to  the  bilateral  datum
plane  respectively  shown  in  Figure  6.  The  dimension
relative  to  the  facial  datum  plane  for  the  V-rail  rollers
are   not   specified   but   recommended   to   be   located
furthest  from  and  symmetrical  about  the  facial  datum
plane  as  shown  in  Figure  3  and  6.  The  float  surface
roller revolute axis must lie on the facial datum plane.
6. 2.2.1  The V-rail and float surface ro llers are defined
in   Figure   7   and   Table   4.   Each   roller   is   radially
symmetric   about   the   revolute   axis.   The   rollers   are
circumferentially    radiused    of    dimension    r8.    The
diameter of the rollers is not specified but the tangential
surface   created   by   dimension r8   must   lie   on   the
horizontal datum plane. The facial datum plane lock pin
radius  is  equal  to r8  and  must  be  positioned  into  the
facial  datum  plane  V-groove  to  fully  constrain  the
cassette  to  the  facial  datum  plane.  The  facial  datum
plane lock pin is translated out of the facial datum plane
V-groove to allow the cassette to be rolled in and out of
the   tool   interface.   Although   only   three   rollers   are
specified   it   is   recommended   to   increase   the   total
number of rollers so that the cassette is fully supported
while  being  loaded  and  unloaded  to  the  tool  interface.
All rollers except for the V-rail and float roller must be
positioned  so  that  the  tangent  of  the r8  dimension  lies
below the horizontal datum plane.
6. 2.2.2  The three features on the botto m of the cassette
that  mate  with  the  rollers  and  lock  pin  must  provide  a
lead-in  capability  that  corrects  a  cassette  misalignment
of  up  to  10  mm  (0.4  in.)  in  any  horizontal  direction,
although  15  mm  (0.6  in.)  is  recommended.  The  V-rail
and  facial  datum  plane  V-groove  are  not  specified  but
recommended to be inverted V-shaped grooves. The V-
rail  is  recommended  to  extend  the  full  length  of  the
cassette from the cassette front to the cassette rear. The
float  surface  is  not  specified  but  recommended  to  be  a
flat  surface  extending  the  full  length  of  the  cassette
from   the   cassette   front   to   the   cassette   rear.   The
exclusion zones for these features are shown in Figure 3
and  6  and  specified  by  dimensions x15, x16  through
x22.
6. 2.3  Cassette Physical Alignment In terface-Type C —
to be developed.
6. 3  Conveyor Rails  —  If  the  casse tte  is  to  be  used  on
roller  conveyors,  each  conveyor  rail  should  extend  the
maximum  distance  from  front  to  back.  The  exclusion
zones  for  conveyor  rails  are  shown  in  Figure  3  and  6
and specified by dimensions x13 and x22 and extends to
the outer boundary of the cassette.
6. 4  Conveying   SurfaceIf   the   cas sette   is   to   be
transported  on  roller  conveyors  that  support  the  entire
bottom of the cassette, the bottom surface excluding the
V-rail,  V-groove,  and  float  roller  zones  is  to  be  used.
The   location   of   this   surface   with   respect   to   the
horizontal datum plane is specified by dimension z3.
6. 5  Substrate  Orientation  and  Num bering   —   The
substrates must be horizontal when the carrier is placed
on  the  coupling,  and  the  substrates  are  numbered  in
increasing  order  from  bottom  to  top  (so  the  bottom
substrate is substrate number 1, the next substrate up is
substrate number 2, etc.)
6. 6  Cassette  Sides  and  Rear  —  Fig ure  2  shows  a  top
view  of  the  boundaries  of  the  cassette  side  domains
(which  contain  the  parts  of  the  cassette  higher  than z4
above  the  horizontal  datum  plane  and  lower  than z9

SEMI D18-0299

above the top substrate). Table 1 defines the dimensions
shown in this and following figures.
6. 7  Cassette Top — The boundari es of the cassette top
domain  contain  any  part  of  the  cassette  higher  than z9
above the top substrate.
6. 8  Cassette Bottom — Figure 3 sh ows a bottom view
of the boundaries of the cassette bottom domain (which
contains any part of the cassette lower than z4 above the
horizontal  datum  plane).  When  the  cassette  is  fully
down,  the  cassette  placement  sensing  pads  must  be z2
above the horizontal datum plane.
6. 9  Vertical   Dimensions   —   Figure    4   shows   the
vertical  dimensions  of  the  left  half  of  the  cassette  as
viewed  from  the  rear.  Note  that z5  (the  height  of  the
bottom   nominal   substrate   seating   plane   above   the
horizontal  datum  plane)  and z8  (the  distance  between
adjacent  nominal  substrate  seating  planes)  are  given  as
reference  dimensions  with  no  tolerance.  This  means
that  the  sum  of  actual  height  variations  in  the  cassette
from  the  horizontal  datum  plane  to  the  mizo  tooth  or
slot holding each substrate must be contained within the
tolerance  of z6  with  no  further  stack-up  at  each  higher
substrate.
6. 9.1   The  open  space  for  the  substra te  extraction
volume  is  indicated  by  dimensions x6  and y7  and  is
symmetric  about  the  bilateral  and  facial  datum  planes,
respectively.  The  top  of  the  extraction  volume  is z7
above   the   nominal   substrate   seating   plane   and   its
bottom is half of the minimum z7 dimension above the
nominal substrate seating plane.  The cassette must give
extra  horizontal  clearance  once  the  substrate  is  picked
up  from  wherever  it  ends  up  (within  the  bounds  of  the
substrate pick-up volume) after transport in the cassette.
6. 9.2    The   open   space   for   the   substra te   set-down
volume  is  indicated  by  dimensions x5  and y6  and  is
symmetric  about  the  bilateral  and  facial  datum  planes,
respectively. The top of this volume is half of z7 above
the nominal substrate seating plane and its bottom is z6
above   the   nominal   substrate   seating   plane.      The
substrate  should  be  placed  within  the  bounds  of  the
substrate  set-down  volume  to  avoid  touching  the  edge
of the substrate to the side of the cassette.
6. 9.3   The  substrate  pick-up  volume   is  defined  by  an
area   indicated   by   dimensions x5   and y5   and   is
symmetric  about  the  bilateral  and  facial  datum  planes,
respectively.    Its  top  and  bottom  are  the  upper  and
lower  tolerance  of z6  around  the  nominal  substrate
seating  plane.  If  a  substrate  is  placed  in  the  substrate
set-down  volume  and  is  then  pushed  to  the  rear  of  the
cassette, then the entire bottom of the substrate must be
contained in the substrate pick-up volume.
6. 10  Pitch   and   Capacity   —   Table   2    shows   the
different  options  with  regard  to  the  substrate  pitch
(spacing) and the cassette capacity.
6. 11  Inner  and  Outer  Radii  —  All  c oncave  features
may have as much as a 1 mm (0.04 in.) radius to allow
for  cleaning  and  to  prevent  contaminant  build-up.  All
required  convex  features  (such  as  the  robotic  handling
flanges,  and  the  corners  of  the  cassette  top  and  bottom
domains)  must  also  have  a  minimum  radius  of  1  mm
(0.04  in.)  to  prevent  small  contact  patches  with  large
stresses that might cause wear and particles.

APPENDIX 1
NOTE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI D18 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures on August
15, 1998.
A1-1  Application Notes
A1-1.1  The shape of the teeth holding the substrates is
not  specified  in  this  standard.  The  tooth  surface  that
touches  the  substrate  should  have  a  large  radius  to
minimize stress on the substrate and tooth.
A1-1.2  Extra clearance (larger than the pitch) has been
added  below  the  bottom  substrate  (for  non-random
sequential  access  to  the  substrates  with  a  faster  or  less
precise  robot).  To  increase  the  stability  of  Type  A
Cassettes  the  points  on  the  cassette  bottom  that  are  the
most  distant  from  the  lines  connecting  each  pair  of
coupling  pins  should  be  made  as  close  as  practical  to
the  horizontal  datum  plane  so  that  the  cassette  cannot
tip very far off of the kinematic coupling.

safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  their  use.  It  is  the
responsibility of the user of these standards to establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the  applicability  of  regulatory  limitations  prior  to  use.
