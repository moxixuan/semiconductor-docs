RELATED INFORMATION 1
NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI M13 and is not intended to modify or supercede the official
standard. The standard should be referred to in all cases. SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the
material  set  forth  herein  for  any  particular  application.  The  determination  of  the  suitability  of  the  material  is  solely  the
responsibility of the user.
R1-1  Consideration for Reliable Automatic
Reading of the Marking
R1-1.1    The  following  suggestions  are  offered  to  assist
in  assuring  the  most  reliable  automatic  reading  of  the
alphanumeric marking.
R1-1.2  Character  Stroke  Thickness  —  If  a  5  ×  9  dot
matrix  is  chosen  for  marking,  it  is  recommended  that
the  minimum  dot  size  be  0.100  mm.    With  a  higher
density dot matrix format, smaller dot diameters may be
employed.  Stroke  thickness  should  be  constant  within
20%  over  the  entire  character  set  so  that  the  reader
settings may be optimized from the specific wafer run.
R1-1.3  Contrast    —    The    character    should    have
sufficient   contrast   to   be   legible.   Contrast   may   be
affected by depth and other conditions.
R1-1.4  Clear  Zone  —  It  is  recommended  that  the  area
immediately  beneath,  and  a  minimum  of  0.500  mm
around,    the    marking    characters    be    of    uniform
reflectivity  and  free  of  any  lithography  and  process
overlay edges.

SPECIFICATION FOR ION IMPLANTATION AND ACTIVATION
PROCESS FOR SEMI-INSULATING GALLIUM ARSENIDE SINGLE
CRYSTALS
1  Scope
The purpose of this document is to present a process for
ion  implantation,  activation,  and  measurement  of  the
resulting  layers  so  that  meaningful  comparisons  can  be
made  between  various  lots  of  semi-insulating  GaAs.
This  test  will  be  performed  by  the  supplier  so  that
product may be represented in a standard way.
NOTE: This is intended to be an interim procedure for
use until a standard test method is developed by ASTM.
2  Process
2. 1      Candidate     lots     must     pass     SEM I     GaAs
specifications   for   resistivity,   mobility,   and   thermal
stability using standard ASTM referee techniques.
2. 2  Implantation Process
2. 2.1   Surface  Preparation  —  The  su rface  treatment
shall be designed to remove residual oxide.
2. 2.2   Implant  Angle  Energy  Species   and  Dose  —  An
energy of 150 keV using Si
29
to  a  dose  of  2  ×  l0
12
/cm
2
and a tilt of 11° to 13° from the (100) toward the (110).
2. 3  Activation Process
2. 3.1   Surface  Preparation  —  No  ch emical  treatment
should be performed prior to activation.
2. 3.2  Activation — The samples sha ll be subjected to a
temperature  of  850°C  for  10  minutes  with  a  second
proximity  wafer  directly  in  contact  with  the  implanted
surface.  The  proximity  wafer  shall  be  identical  to  the
subject  wafer  except  not  subjected  to  ion  implantation.
The  ambient  of  the  furnace  shall  be  a  gas  such  as
nitrogen or argon.
2. 4  Layer Evaluation
2. 4.1   Evaluation  of  the  activated  sam ples  shall  be
based  upon  CV  profiling,  mobility,  and  resistivity  as
specified according to standard ASTM techniques.

10  Certification
10. 1    Upon  request  of  the  purchaser  in  the  contract  or
order,  a  manufacturer’s  or  supplier’s  certification  that
the material was manufactured and tested in accordance
with  the  specification  shall  be  furnished  at  the  time  of
shipment  (Certificate  of  Compliance).  Upon  request,  a
report   of   the   test   results   may   also   be   required
(Certificate of Analysis).
10. 2    In  the  interest  of  controlling  inspection  costs,  the
supplier  and  the  purchaser  may  agree  that  the  material
shall   be   certified   as   “capable   of   meeting”   certain
requirements.    In  this  context,  “capable  of  meeting”
shall signify that the supplier is not required to perform
the  appropriate  test  in  Section  9.    However,  if  the
purchaser  performs  the  test  and  the  material  fails  to
meet  the  requirement,  the  material  may  be  subject  to
rejection.

Otherwise  all  poly  shall  be  handled,  inspected,  and
packed  in  bags  and  boxes  in  such  a  manner  as  to
minimize abrasion, chipping, and contamination, and in
accordance  with  the  best  industry  practices  to  provide
ample protection against damage during shipment.
11. 2  The poly supplied under the specification shall be
identified  by  appropriately  labeling  the  outside  of  each
box  and  each  bag  therein.    Identification  shall  include,
as  a  minimum,  the  weight  and  lot  number  of  the
polysilicon.    The  lot  number  shall  provide  traceability
to information concerning the manufacturing history of
the particular poly in that lot.  Such information shall be
kept  on  file  at  the  manufacturer’s  facility  for  at  least
three years after that particular lot has been accepted by
the purchaser.

NOTICE: This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  M16.    It  was  developed  during  the
revision of the document in May 2003.  This related information was approved for publication by full letter
ballot on September 19, 2003.
R1-1  Introduction
R1-1.1    SEMI  M16  and  JEITA  EM-3601  both  provide
specification  requirements  for  polycrystalline  silicon
(poly) in nugget (chunk), granular, and rod forms.
R1-1.2        This    related    information    section    provides
comparisons between the two specifications with regard
both  to  the  specification  requirements  and  to  the  test
methods cited.
R1-2  Specification Requirements
R1-2.1    The  philosophies  of  the  two  specifications  are
quite   different   in   that   JEITA   EM-3601   spells   out
specific  purity  requirements,  while  SEMI  M16  leaves
these  to  be  “as  specified  by  the  customer.”    The  levels
specified  in  JEITA  EM-3601  may  serve  as  a  starting
point for developing the necessary specifications.
R1-2.2  Purity Requirements
R1-2.2.1      JEITA   EM-3601   lists   the   following   bulk
purity requirements for the nugget and rod forms:
R1-2.2.1.1  Acceptor concentration, maximum:
• B     0.05     ppba
• Al   0.05   ppba
R1-2.2.1.2  Donor concentration, maximum:
• P     0.3     ppba
• As   0.05   ppba
R1-2.2.1.3  Carbon concentration, maximum:
• C      0.3      ppma
R1-2.2.2      JEITA   EM-3601   lists   the   following   bulk
purity requirements for the granular form:
• Total acceptors (B+Al) 0.1 ppba, maximum
• Total donors (P+As) 0.4 ppba, maximum
• Carbon                                    0.3                                    ppma,                                    maximum
R1-2.2.3    JEITA  EM-3601  lists  the  following  surface
metal  contamination  requirements  for  the  nugget  and
granular forms (maximum surface metal contamination
levels are not listed for the rod form):
• Fe, Cr, Ni, and Na 3.0 ppbw, maximum
• Zn                                           1.0                                           ppbw,                                           maximum

R1-3.1  Sample Preparation
R1-3.1.1      JEITA   EM-3601   contains   instructions   for
preparing   samples   for   photoluminescence,   infrared
absorption,    and    atomic    absorption    spectroscopy
measurements.  It cites the 1996 edition of JIS H 0615
for  the  preparation  of  samples  from  nugget  and  rod
forms for photoluminescence measurements.</p><p>SEMI M16-1103 © SEMI 1989, 2003 5
R1-3.1.2        SEMI    M16    specifies    that    samples    for
photoluminescence and infrared measurements are to be
prepared from nugget and rod forms in accordance with
SEMI  MF1723  and  from  granular  form  in  accordance
with  SEMI  MF1708.    Samples  for  atomic  absorption
spectroscopy   measurements   are   to   be   prepared   in
accordance with SEMI MF1724.
R1-3.1.3      The   preparation   procedures   are   generally
similar,  except  that  JIS  H  0615  allows  coring  only
perpendicular  to  the  rod  filament,  but  SEMI  MF1723
permits coring parallel with the rod filament in addition
to perpendicular to the rod filament.
R1-3.2  Measurement Procedures
R1-3.2.1  The photoluminescence technique is specified
for  measurement  of  donor  and  acceptor  concentrations
in  both  JEITA  EM-3601  and  in  SEMI  M16  (through
reference to SEMI MF1723); the latter also allows this
determination by low temperature FT-IR analysis.  The
photoluminescence   technique   is   covered   in   SEMI
MF1389  and  in  JIS  H  0615.    The  latter,  specified  in
JEITA   EM-3601,   allows   only   the   high   excitation
condition for the photoluminescence analysis while the
former allows either high or low excitation.
R1-3.2.2    The  infrared  absorption  method  is  specified
for  the  carbon  determination  in  both  SEMI  M16  and
JEITA  EM-3601.    The  two  cited  test  methods,  SEMI
MF1391, specified in SEMI M16 (through reference to
SEMI  MF1723),  and  JEITA  EM-3503,  cited  in  JEITA
EM-3601, are essentially equivalent.
R1-3.2.3  Atomic  absorption  spectroscopy  is  specified
for the surface metal contamination in both SEMI M16
and  JEITA  EM-3601.    The  two  cited  test  methods,
SEMI  MF1724,  specified  in  SEMI  M16,  and  JIS  K
0121,    cited    in    JEITA    EM-3601,    are    essentially
equivalent   insofar   as   the   actual   measurement   is
concerned,  but  SEMI  MF1724  also  standardizes  the
sampling  procedures,  etching  solutions,  and  method  of
collecting the impurities in much greater detail.</p><p>NOTICE: SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or

GUIDE FOR A UNIVERSAL WAFER GRID
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American Regional Standards Committee on April 22, 2004.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> May 2004;

1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1    Maximum  allowable  slip  and  other  non-uniformly
distributed   defects   are   frequently   specified   when
procuring  polished  and  epitaxial  silicon  wafers.    SEMI
M2  specifies  a  maximum  allowable  fraction  of  the
epitaxial wafer surface area that can contain slip.</li><li>2    This  guide  provides  a  design  for  and  guidance  for
use  of  a  wafer  grid  that  facilitates  the  determination  of
the   fraction   of   the   wafer   surface   area   covered   by
observed defects.
2  Scope</li><li>1    This  document  defines  a  grid  pattern  that  is  useful
for  quantifying  surface  defects  on  a  nominally  circular
semiconductor  wafer.  The  grid  is  defined  such  that  it
contains  1000  elements  of  approximately  equal  area.
Each grid element thus contains 0.1 percent of the total
quality area of the surface being inspected. Defects that
are non-uniformly distributed (for example, slip) can be
quantified  in  terms  of  the  percent  defective  (or  percent
useful) area on the wafer surface.</li><li>2  The grid described is referenced to the center of the
wafer.  A  concept  of  a  “Fixed  Quality  Area”  is  used,
based  on  nominal  wafer  diameter,  such  as  is  specified
in SEMI M1.</li><li>3    Methods  for  observing  these  defects  on  silicon
wafer surfaces are outside the scope of this guide.  Such
methods   may   be   found   in   SEMI   MF1725,   SEMI
MF1726, JIS H 0609, and DIN 50434.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

5  Grid Element Layout
5. 1  Grid Element Scheme
5. 1.1    Two  types  of  grids  are  defined:  one  for  wafers
without  a  primary  flat  (for  example,  wafers  where  the
primary  fiducial  is  a  notch),  and  one  for  wafers  with  a
primary  flat.  The  grid  is  divided  by  18  concentric
circles  containing  radial  divisions  which  are  assigned
according  to  the  diameter  of  each  circle  (see  Table  1).
The  relative  diameters  of  the  concentric  circles  are
established  by  the  areas  of  each  annulus.  To  find  the</p><p>1  Available, in Japanese language edition only, through the Japanese

actual  diameter  of  any  circle,  multiply  the  relative
diameter by the outer diameter of the grid.
5. 1.2  The outer diameter of the grid is chosen to be the
size   appropriate   for   a   particular   application.   This
diameter  would  normally  be  chosen  to  be  the  nominal
diameter  of  the  fixed  quality  area  to  allow  for  such
things  as  an  edge  exclusion,  tolerance  variations  in  the
wafer  diameter,  and  edge  rounding.  Table  2  shows  the
circle diameters for a series of grids which have a fixed
quality area radius 3 or 4 mm smaller than the nominal
radius of selected wafers specified in SEMI M1.
5. 1.3    Identification  of  each  grid  element  is  done  by
referring  to  a  circle  number  and  a  division  number  on
that  circle.  Circles  are  numbered  from  the  center  out,
with   the   center   circle   being   number   01   and   the
outermost  circle  being  number  18.  The  divisions  are
numbered      starting      with      the      first      division
counterclockwise  from  the  horizontal  line  which  starts
at  the  center  of  the  grid  and  extends  to  the  right,  when
the  primary  fiducial  (flat  or  notch)  is  placed  at  the
bottom    of    the    grid.    Divisions    are    progressively
numbered  counterclockwise  from  01  to  n,  where  n
equals  the  total  number  of  divisions  on  the  circle.  An
element’s  address  is  given  by  two  sets  of  numbers
separated  by  a  comma:  circle  (0–18),  division  (01–n).
Elements 18, 01 and 18, 100 are identified in Figure 1.
5. 2  Wafers without a Primary Flat
5. 2.1    The  grid  elements  for  wafers  without  a  primary
flat are illustrated in Figure 1. This pattern is generated
by  making  concentric  circles  with  relative  diameters
and radial divisions as specified in Table 1. In this table
the  circle  number  is  given  in  the  leftmost  column.  The
number  of  divisions  and  the  included  angle  of  each
division  in  the  circle  are  given  in  the  second  and  third
columns. The total number of divisions (from the center
outward)  is  given  in  the  fourth  column.  The  included
area ratio, given in the fifth column, is the total number
of  divisions  included  within  a  circle  divided  by  1000,
the  total  number  of  divisions  in  the  grid.  The  relative
diameter,  given  in  the  rightmost  column,  is  the  square
root of the included area ratio.
5. 3  Wafers with a Primary Flat
5. 3.1      For   wafers   with   a   primary   flat,   a   standard
included angle of 43.2° is used for all wafer sizes. This
angle was chosen because it lies between the maximum
and  minimum  included  angles  of  the  primary  flats
specified in SEMI M1 for 100 mm, 125 mm, 150 mm,
and  200  mm  diameter  wafers.  In  addition,  if  a  fixed
quality area of radius 3 mm less than the nominal wafer
radius (or smaller) is used, the grid will not in any case
extend beyond the edge of the wafer in the region of the
primary flat.
5. 3.2      This   flat   is   propagated   into   the   wafer   as
illustrated in Figure 2. The diameter of each circle is the
same  as  for  wafers  without  a  primary  flat.  The  flat  is
propagated  vertically  downward  (starting  with  circle
number  3)  by  the  intersection  of  the  circle  with  a
horizontal chord which subtends 43.2°.
5. 3.3      The   areas   of   the   grid   elements   within   the
propagated flat region are slightly smaller than the areas
of  the  regular  grid  elements.  This  difference  is  ignored
when counting grid elements for wafers with a primary
flat.  All  grid  elements  are  assumed  to  be  0.001  of  the
total fixed quality area.
5. 4  Secondary Flats
5. 4.1      The   grid   ignores   secondary   flats.   These   are
shallow  enough  that  the  outer  circle  does  not  extend
beyond the wafer edge if a fixed quality area of radius 3
mm less than the nominal wafer radius is used.
NOTE  1:    In  this  sense,  the  fixed  quality  area  used  by  the
Universal  Wafer  Grid  deviates  somewhat  from  the  formal
definition in SEMI M1 which embodies an edge exclusion of
constant  width  around  the  entire  periphery  of  the  wafer
including the region of the secondary flat.
6  Use of the Grid
6. 1    The  quantification  of  defective  area  is  done  by
overlaying  a  transparency  of  the  grid  onto  a  map  of
wafer  defects  or  by  mapping  observed  defects  onto  the
grid.    The  number  of  grid  elements  which  contain
defects  is  counted.    The  element  count  divided  by  10
corresponds to the percent of defective area.  This grid
could   also   be   superimposed   onto   a   CRT   display,
photograph,    or    computer    generated    map,    where
applicable.    In  use,  grid  pattern  diameters  must  be
scaled to the size of the map or image of the wafer to be
overlaid.</p><p>SEMI M17-0704 © SEMI 1990, 2004 3

FORMAT FOR SILICON WAFER SPECIFICATION FORM FOR ORDER
ENTRY
This format was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  Japanese  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  Japanese  Regional  Standards
Committee  on  April  30,  2004.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  June  2004;  to  be  published  July  2004.
Originally published in 1990; last published March 2004.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  This format provides a standard form for specifying
several classifications of silicon wafers, as follows:</li><li>1.1  Polished Silicon Wafers.</li><li>1.2  Epitaxial Silicon Wafers.</li><li>1.3  Epitaxial Silicon Wafers with Buried Layer.</li><li>1.4  Annealed Silicon Wafer.</li><li>1.5  SOI Wafers for CMOS Applications.</li><li>2        This    format    also    lists    the    Electronic    Data
Interchange  (EDI)  codes  used  in  SEMI  T6  to  identify
the type of data being reported in the EDI message.
2  Scope</li><li>1    The  form  is  designed  to  be  used  in  conjunction
with  other  SEMI  specifications  where  details  of  the
dimensional,     physical,     electrical,     and     chemical
properties are defined or specified.  However, the form
includes  many  items  that  are  not  currently  included  in
the SEMI specifications.  Also, many items are not now
commonly     specified,     but     may     find     increased
importance in the future.  The intention is to provide for
flexibility and expansion of the technology.</li><li>2    This  format  provides  for  specifying  and  ordering
silicon  wafers  with  varying  levels  of  complexity.    The
minimum level of completeness is shown in each case,
with    additional    options    included    to    allow    for
customization  of  the  wafer  to  the  specific  processing
requirements  of  the  user.    If  a  particular  item  is  not  of
interest, no entry is required.  The only required entries
are  those  marked  as  such  for  the  purpose  of  minimal
specification  (diameter,  orientation,  dopant,  resistivity,
etc.).</li><li>3    Values  for  many  items  are  listed  either  in  the
polished  silicon  wafer  standards  in  SEMI  M1  or  in  the
defect  limits  tables  in  SEMI  M1,  SEMI  M2,  or  SEMI
M11.  If these standard specifications are sufficient for
defining  the  wafers,  only  a  single  entry  is  required  in
each section of the form.</li><li>4    This  format  also  lists  the  codes  required  by  SEMI
T6  to  identify  the  parameter  being  reported  in  the  EDI
message.    Where  necessary,  secondary  characteristics
or   identifier   codes   are   listed   within   a   generalized
characteristic.</li><li>5  For referee purposes, U.S. Customary units shall be
used  for  wafers  of  2-  and  3-inch  diameters,  and  SI
(System  International,  commonly  called  metric)  units
for 100 mm and larger diameter wafers.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

4  Terminology
4. 1    The  items  listed  in  the  form  are  referenced  and
defined  in  various  documents.    A  reference  for  most
items  in  Parts  2  and  3  of  the  form  is  listed  in  Table  1.
The  entries  in  the  table  are  keyed  to  the  form  by  item
number.  Because terms related to epitaxial wafers with
buried layer are defined in this standard and because no
standardized    test    methods    for    the    buried    layer
parameters  exist,  Table  1  does  not  include  line  items
from Part 4 of the form.
4. 2  General term used in this standard:
4. 2.1  required  (req.  or  req&#x27;d)  ó  when  applied  to  a
parameter listed in the order form, a user-supplied value
is   necessary   to   minimally   define   the   material   for
manufacture.
4. 3      Terms   related   to   epitaxial   wafers   with   buried
layers:
4. 3.1  buried  layer  ó  a  diffused  region  in  a  substrate
that  is,  or  is  intended  to  be,  covered  with  an  epitaxial
layer.
4. 3.2  alignment  precision  ó  pattern  displacement  in
first mask photolithography process.
NOTE 3:  Alignment   precision   is   specified   by   maximum
values  of  X  and  Y,  the  displacement  of  the  center  of  the
pattern   from   a   reference   position   defined   in   the   wafer
specification in terms of the wafer coordinate system defined
in  SEMI  M20,  and  the  maximum  value  of  θ,  the  angle
between  the  x-axis  of  the  pattern  and  the  primary  orientation
flat (see Figure 1).</p><p>7 The Amercan Society of Mechanical Engineers, United Engineering
Center, 345 E. 47th St., New York, NY 10017.
4. 3.3  pattern distortion ratio ó absolute magnitude of
the  quotient  of  the  (1)  difference  between  the  width  of
the pattern on the substrate and the width of the pattern
on  the  top  surface  of  the  epitaxial  layer  and  (2)  the
thickness of the epitaxial layer.</p><p>Figure 2

4. 3.4  pattern shift ratio ó lateral distance between the
center   point   of   the   pattern   on   the   surface   of   the
substrate  and  the  center  point  of  the  pattern  on  the
surface  of  the  epitaxial  layer  divided  by  the  epitaxial
layer thickness.
NOTE 4:  Pattern shift ratio, d/t (see Figure 4), is specified in
terms  of  a  nominal  value,  X,  and  a  tolerance,  ±  Y,  both  of
which are dimensionless because both d and t are in μm.</p><p>Figure 4

7  Testing Level and Certification
7. 1    Material  ordered  using  this  format  shall  be  tested
and/or  certified  to  the  limits  set  forth  in  the  individual
criteria.
7. 2      The   actual   testing   level,   whether   the   test   is
performed on all wafers, a sample of the wafers, special
test pieces representing all portions of the material, or a
sample  of  the  test  pieces,  may  be  specified  using  this
format.
7. 3    In  some  cases,  the  material  may  be  certified  as
ìcapable   of   meetingî   certain   requirements.   In   this
context, the supplier is not required to perform the tests
outlined   in   this   format.   However,   if   the   purchaser
performs  the  test  and  the  material  fails  to  meet  the
requirement, the material may be subject to rejection.
8  EDI Codes and Sub-Parameter Codes
8. 1  The EDI Codes for each parameter are listed in the
following    Table.        Where    necessary    for    clarity,
additional   sub-parameters   are   listed.      These   sub-
parameter identify a specific measurement technique or
method to be used.
8. 2    If  additional  codes  are  required  in  the  future,  they
will  be  added  to  the  table,  beginning  with  the  next
available EDI code identifier.  This will allow the table
to  be  rearranged  for  clarity  while  maintaining  unique
and   consistent   EDI   codes   for   existing   parameters.
Table  2  provides  a  numerically  sorted  list  of  the  EDI
Codes.

SPECIFICATION FOR ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF BULK GALLIUM
ARSENIDE SINGLE CRYSTAL SUBSTRATES
1  Introduction
For  the  specification,  three  principal  types  of  material
were  identified:  semi-insulating,  n-type,  and  p-type.
This   encompasses   the   full   range   of   conductivity
characteristics  for  Gallium  Arsenide  (GaAs).  Section  3
considers  subclasses  of  these  characteristics  defining
the   species   which   may   be   used   for   producing   the
conductivity  type.  For  semi-insulating  material,  special
cases have been isolated.
Undoped,  Grade  A1  represents  those  materials  which
are  of  high  resistivity  and  stable  following  growth,
without   necessitating   any   additional   annealing   or
processing.   The   Grade   A2   material,   “high   purity”,
requires    additional    thermal    processing    following
growth to bring the resistivity to a level &gt; 10
7
Ω-cm.  At
this   time,   most   producers   have   indicated   that   the
majority   of   the   Grade   A2   ingots   have   resistivity
characteristics which rise into the acceptable range after
an    appropriate    thermal    cycle.        However,    this
phenomenon  is  sensitive  to  the  details  of  the  time-
temperature cycle, and thus, such an increase cannot be
guaranteed in every application.  Thus, the label “Grade
A2” is used to denote this material.
Chromium  doping  produces  a  high  resistivity  material.
However,   due   to   the   rapid   diffusion   of   Cr   during
processing and the propensity for surface accumulation,
it is not as well suited to processing as grades 3.A.1 and
3. A.2, thus we assign this material “grade A”.
Iso-electric dopant additions do not appear to affect the
resistivity significantly, but rather, permit the reduction
of dislocation generation in the final product. Thus, this
material  is  classified  Grade  A.  While  In  is  the  most
effective hardening agent, Al, P, and Sb are also viable
species.  They  are  included  for  completeness  and  to
reduce  the  likelihood  of  document  revision  at  a  later
date.  The  Grade  B  specification  encompasses  those
materials where the impurity and point defect densities
are not quite in the proper balance, but the resistivity is
suitable for less-stringent applications.
For  conducting  material,  the  best  characterized,  non-
transition  metal  species  have  been  included  as  n-type
dopants; for p-type, a broader range of species has been
included,   as   transition   metals   are   useful   acceptor
impurities.
Section  4  defines  the  resistivity  and  stability  of  semi-
insulating material as specified in Section 3. A stringent
limit was placed on the Grade A2 material to minimize
the   likelihood   that   this   material   converts   to   low
resistivity   upon   annealing.   The   issue   of   surface
conversion  in  Cr-doped  material  was  dealt  with  by
eliminating   a   requirement   for   n-type   characteristics
following annealing.
The  resistivity  ranges  for  n-type  conducting  material
were  determined  from  the  carrier  concentration  table
(Section  5)  and  mobility  values,  using  the  analysis  of
Walukiewicz  et  al,  J.  Appl.  Phys.  50  (1979)  899.  This
places  a  constraint  on  the  permissible  compensation
ratio, selected to be in the range of approximately 0.0 to
0. 7.  The  specification  was  designed  then  to  exclude
abnormally  poor  crystals.  As  limited  data  and  demand
exist  for  p-type  material,  there  are  no  ranges  specified
at this writing. Should a significant body of data evolve,
this  specification  may  be  designed  and  balloted  as
appropriate.
Section   5   deals   with   impurity   concentrations,   net
electron   yields   and   implicitly,   with   point   defect
concentrations.  For  semi-insulating  material  of  high
quality,  the  impurities  are,  at  the  present  time,  not
reliably  measurable  (carbon  is  the  notable  exception).
Thus  the  “unspecified”  nomenclature.  For  types  A-3
and   A-4,   the   determination   of   the   amount   of   the
relevant  impurity  species  is  given  to  the  appropriate
party, the user, and producer, respectively.
For n-type materials, the ranges were selected to define
a high purity regime (n ≤ 4 × 10
16
cm
-3
), an intermediate
regime where donor density is not more than ~10 times
the  typical  deep  level  density;  the  transition  region
wherein  deep  levels  are  suppressed  (range  B-3);  a
highly    doped    range    (&gt;    10    ppm    net    electron
concentration   yield);   and   “saturation”   doping   range
where  the  crystal  growth  process  and  thermodynamics
determine   the   limits   of   impurity   incorporation   and
electron yield.
In Section 6, the electron mobility values and ranges are
stated.  For  semi-insulating  materials,  the  values  that
have  been  determined  by  consensus  are  5000  cm
2
/V-s
for  Grade  A1  and  6000  cm
2
/V-s.  In  the  interest  of
harmony,     and     to     prevent     further     debilitating
discussions,  the  authors  and  participants  at  the  SEMI
meetings, and responses from producers have been used
to   set   this   value   at   5000   cm
2
/V-s.   The   producers
indicated  that  the  Grade  A2  material  nearly  always
exceeds 6000 cm
2
/V-s, and thus this value was adopted.
For  chromium  doped  materials,  the  mobility  is  less
predictable  and,  therefore,  is  negotiated  between  the
user and producer. In-doped materials have consistently
lower     mobilities,     resulting     from     strain-effects,</p><p>SEMI M19-91 © SEMI 1991, 19962
scattering, and other related phenomena. Thus, based on
producer  experience,  the  minimum  value  was  set  at
3500 cm
2
/V-s.
For n-type materials, the mobility ranges were selected
to   represent   compensation   ratios   in   the   range   of
approximately   0.0   to   0.7   for   a   given   net   electron
concentration.  P-type  material  is  not  yet  characterized
sufficiently to warrant a specification.
2  Scope
This  document  specifies  the  characteristics  and  ranges
of  electrical  properties  for  bulk  GaAs  crystals  and
substrate   wafers.   For   high   resistivity   and   n-type
conducting materials, the permissible growth conditions
or  impurity  species  are  stated;  the  electrical  properties
corresponding  to  the  appropriate  range(s)  are  noted.
Due   to   the   limited   understanding,   experience   and
demand   for   p-type   materials   only   guidelines   are
provided in this specification at the present writing.
