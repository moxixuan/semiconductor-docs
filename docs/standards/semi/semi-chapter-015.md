7. 2   BOLTS/Light  Exclusion  Volume  ó  Equipment  or
loadport unit compliant with this standard must provide
a   BOLTS/Light   exclusion   volume   defined   in   this
section.    BOLTS/Light  exclusion  volume  consists  of
multiple   sub-volumes   and   spaces   defined   in   this
section.    The  box  opener/loader  compliant  with  this
standard    must    be    compatible    with    BOLTS/Light
exclusion  volume.    Bolts/Light  exclusion  volume  is
shown in Figure 2.
7. 2.1   Loader  Exclusion  Volume  ó  Loader  exclusion
volume is an exclusion volume for the main part of box
opener/loader that is defined by x108, y101, y110, y111,
and  z107.  y111  is  intentionally  shorter  than  SEMI
E15.1  D  dimension  in  order  to  allow  the  equipment
integrators   to   place   a   safety   door,   a   carrier   ID
reader/writer,  and/or  any  other  features  required  by  the
user. An additional removable cover can be mounted on
the  box  opener/loader  if  it  is  to  be  supplied  as  a
complete   unit   compliant   with   the   SEMI   E15.1   D
dimension.
7. 2.2    Door   Seal   Exclusion   Volume   ó   Door   seal
exclusion  volume  is  an  exclusion  volume  for  the  door
seal portion of box opener/loader that is defined by the
distance  between  the  plane  at  the  SEMI  E15.1  D1  and
y101, x108, and z109.
7. 2.3    BOLTS/Light   Opening   Exclusion   Volume   ó
BOLTS/Light  opening  exclusion  volume  is  an  exclu-
sion volume for the box opener/loader encroachment of
equipment  from  BOLTS/Light  plane  at  portion  above
the  permanent  reserved  space.  There  should  be  an
opening when the door is opened. Through this opening
substrates  may  be  moved  between  the  box  on  the
BOLTS/Light   compliant   box   opener/loader   and   the
equipment   by   a   wafer   handler   in   the   equipment.
BOLTS/Light  opening  exclusion  volume  is  defined  by
x102, y103, z103, and z108.
7. 2.4    Permanent   Reserved   Space   ó   Space   that   is
reserved   permanently   in   the   equipment   defined   by
x102, y102, z105, and z108.
7. 2.5  Temporarily  Reserved  Space  ó  Space  that  is
reserved temporarily during a door open/close motion is
being   done   and   when   the   door   is   closed.      The
temporarily  reserved  space  during  a  door  open/close  is
defined  by  x102,  y102,  y103,  z103,  and  z108.  The
temporarily  reserved  space  when  a  door  is  closed  is
defined by x102, y103, y112, z103, and z108.
7. 2.6  The Loader Bottom Flange Exclusion Volume ó
The   loader   bottom   flange   exclusion   volume   is   an
exclusion  volume  for  fixing  the  box  opener/loader  to
bottom   interface   plane.   Loader   bottom   flanges   are
located    on    the    both    bottom    side    of    the    box
opener/loader and directly mounted on bottom interface
plane.  The  loader  bottom  flange  exclusion  volume  is
defined by x108, x109, y115, y116, and z113 measured
from the bottom end of z107.
NOTE 3: The  spaces  to  access  the  fixing  bolt  should  be
reserved  by  equipment  side.  This  document  does  not  define
these spaces.
7. 3  Side  Interface  Features ó  This  standard  defines
the  equipment  side  of  the  side  interface  features.    Side
interface  features  are  defined  with  respect  to  ìDocked
facial  datum  planeî  instead  of  ìFacial  datum  planeî.
The  box  opener/loader  should  mate  with  these  features
to provide the seal to the equipment.  The side interface
features are shown in Figure 2.
7. 3.1  BOLTS/Light  Plane ó  The  BOLTS/Light  plane
is defined to be parallel to and at a distance y101 from
the docked facial datum plane.  The Seal Zone is on this
plane.
7. 3.2  Cycle-to-Cycle   Repeatability   ó   The   cycle-to-
cycle repeatability of y101 must be within y113.
7. 3.3  Seal   Zone ó   The   equipment   side   of   the
BOLTS/Light  plane  specified  by  x101,  x103,  z101,
z102,  z104,  and z106  must  be  a  flat  area  for  sealing
between the equipment and the box opener/loader.
7. 3.3.1    The  flatness  of  the  seal  zone  must  be  within
y114  and  the  perpendicularity  of  the  seal  zone  to  the
facial and horizontal datum planes must be within
σ1.
7. 3.3.2  This standard only defines the seal zone on the
equipment  side.    The  actual  seal  is  not  defined  in  this
standard,    but    should    be    mounted    on    the    box
opener/loader.
7. 3.4  Wafer Position ó This standard defines a typical
wafer position when the box opener/loader positions the
wafers  to  the  equipment.    The  facial  datum  plane  of  a
docked carrier is defined by y110 from the facial datum
plane.  This provides compatible wafer center positions
from the facial datum plane.
NOTE  4:  This  means  that  this  standard  defines  a  specified
typical docking stroke.
7. 4  Bottom Interface Features ó This standard defines
mainly  the  equipment  side  of  the  bottom  interface
features.      Bottom   Interface   Features   are   shown   in
Figure 3.
7. 4.1    Regarding  the  box  opener/loader,  parallelism  of
the  bottom  interface  feature  and  the  horizontal  datum
plane must be within
σ2.
7. 4.2  Bottom Interface Planes ó The Bottom Interface
Feature   should   have   two   Bottom   Interface   Planes
defined  by  x104,  x105,  y104,  y105,  and  z107.  Nothing
other   than   locating   pins   can   protrude   above   these
planes.    During  maintenance,  the  front  end  of  the



SEMI E92-0302
E

loading  slider  area  should  be  open  z112  under  the
bottom interface planes.
7. 4.3  Loader  Locating  Pins  ó  Equipment  must  have
two    Loader    locating    pins    to    locate    the    box
opener/loader  so  as  to  provide  highly  repeatable  and
quick  attachment/detachment.    Horizontal  locations  of
the  loader  locating  pins  are  defined  by  x106  and  y106.
Height  of  the  loader  locating  pins  is  defined  by  z110.
Diameter  of  the  loader  locating  pins  is  defined  by  d1.
A box opener/loader compatible with this standard must
refer these two Loader Locating pins.
7. 4.3.1  Positioning  Pin  ó  Loader  locating  pin  on  the
left  side  from  operator  is  a  positioning  pin  that  is  used
to hold box opener/loader both in x and y directions.
7. 4.3.2  Anti-Rotation Pin ó Loader locating pin on the
right  side  from  operator  is  an  anti-rotation  pin  that  is
used  to  hold  box  opener/loader  in  y direction only (see
Figure 4).
7. 4.4  Locking  Screws  ó  Four  locking  screws  defined
by x106, y107,    and    y108    to    tighten    the    box
opener/loader.
7. 4.4.1      The   equipment   should   have   M8-16   tapped
holes at these locations.
7. 4.5  Control  Connection  Area  ó  Area  used  to  pass
connectors,   wires,   and   tubes   for   electrical   signals,
power supply and other inlets/outlets.
7. 4.5.1    The  control  connection  area  is  defined  at  the
same height as the the bottom interface planes by x107
and y109.
NOTE  5:  This  standard  only  defines  the  connection  area  for
the   box   opener/loader   itself.   It   is   recommended   that
connectors   will   be   located   above   this   area   for   quick
maintainability.
7. 4.5.2      Other   connections   which   will   possibly   be
located  in  this  area  for  other  functions  are  listed  below
and may be defined in separate standards:
• Carrier  ID  reader/writer  head  interface  (automated
units  that  read  or  write  to  an  ID  tag  defined  in
SEMI E15.1)
• Manual operation panel
• Wafer mapper
7. 5  Panel Interface Height ó This standard defines an
optional  panel  interface  height  so  as  to  provide  panel
installation  height  to  enclose  box  opener/loader  in  the
equipment.    Panel  interface  height  is  defined  by  z111
from  horizontal  datum  plane.    In  case  this  option  is
used, both equipment and the box opener/loader should
have forklifts exclusion volume defined by SEMI E15.1
H0.

APPENDIX 1
APPLICATION NOTES
NOTE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E92  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot  procedures  on
December 3, 1999 by the Japanese Regional Standards Committee.
A1-1  NOTICE: Usage of Loader Locating Pins
A1-1.1    In  order  to  provide  quick  interchangeability
with accurate repeatability, it is recommended to use V
shaped  groove  to  couple  with  the  positioning  pin  and
use  flat  plane  to  couple  with  the  anti-rotation  pin  as
shown in Figure 4.
A1-2  NOTICE: BOLTS/Light Shelf
A1-2.1    BOLTS/Light  Shelf  may  be  used  in  order  to
keep  compatibility  with  BOLTS/M  interface.    In  this
case,  BOLTS/M  interface  provides  backward  compati-
bility  of  equipment  interface  and  BOLTS/Light  inter-
face  provides  standardized  precise  quick  attachment/
detachment  interface.    BOLTS/Light  shelf  is  shown  in
Figure A-1.
A1-3    NOTICE:  Box  Opener/Loader  Compati-
bility
A1-3.1    It  is  recommended  that  equipment  suppliers
design   their   process   equipment   to   be   capable   of
accepting box opener/loaders that interface with either a
BOLTS/M interface or a BOLTS/Light interface.  This
standard has been structured to make the BOLTS/Light
interface  a  component  capable  of  being  attached  to  a
BOLTS/M  interface.    (It  is  not  physically  feasible  to
make  the  BOLTS/M  interface  an  optional  component
capable of being attached to a BOLTS/Light interface).
A1-3.2  If an equipment supplier provides a BOLTS/M
interface,  their  process  equipment  can  be  modularly
configured  to  interface  with  either  type  of  box/opener
loader.      This   type   of   approach   allows   ìtwo-way
compatibilityî:
• Process  equipment  with  a  BOLTS/M  interface  can
attach  a  BOLTS/Light  interface.  This  enables  the
process    equipment    to    now    accept    a    box
opener/loader with a BOLTS/Light interface.
• Process  equipment  with  a  BOLTS/Light  interface
can remove the BOLTS/Light interface to expose a
BOLTS/M  interface.    This  enables  the  process
equipment to now accept a box opener/loader with
a BOLTS/M interface.
Equipment suppliers may provide only a BOLTS/Light
interface  at  their  discretion.    However,  it  should  be
understood  that  process  equipment  designed  in  this
manner  can  not  be  modularly  configured  to  accept  a
box/opener loader with a BOLTS/M interface.
A1-4    NOTICE:  Docking  Stroke  Variation  for
Backward Compatibility
A1-4.1    In  order  to  provide the ìBackward compatibil-
ityî requested in I300I/J300 GJG
1
, vendors who want to
use this standard to put BOLTS/Light unit in their exist-
ing BOLTS/M compliant loadport unit may vary dock-
ing stroke as their option to accommodate their existing
designs.  The unit that has a different docking stroke is
no more a BOLTS/Light-Full-Compliant unit, but could
be called as BOLTS/Light-Quasi-Compatible unit.
A1-5  NOTICE: Sliding Mechanism
A1-5.1    Actual  design  of  the  sliding  mechanism  is  left
to  the  box  opener/loader  and/or  equipment  designer.
The  equipment  provides  bottom  interface  planes  as  the
loading slider areas.
A1-5.1.1  This implies several types of bottom interface
planes  are  acceptable  by  the  equipment;  e.g.,  roller
guided, plastic material based, etc.
A1-6  NOTICE: Maintenance Cart
A1-6.1      If   the   box   opener/loader   is   too   heavy   to
attach/detach   manually   by   maintainer,   this   standard
provides   for   the   possibility/capability   of   cart-based
maintenance.
A1-6.2    The  cart  may  use  the  same  cart  to  equipment
docking mechanism as the cart for FOUP delivery.
A1-6.3      The   maintenance   cart   may   also   use   a
connection  with  the  bottom  interface  planes  that  are
defined in this standard.  Specification of how to make
the carts is outside the scope of this standard.
A1-7  NOTICE: Finger Pinch Sensor
A1-7.1  This document does not define or specify a fin-
ger  pinch  sensor.    Considering  finger  pinching  with
edges, the following approach may be recommended.
• Finger  pinching  with  edges  is  more  serious  than  it
is with flat surfaces.  So, it is recommended not to
place   the   box   flange   seal   in   a   narrow   tunnel
structure  which  have  sharp  edges  but  place  it  on  a
flat  surface  (or  in  a  dimple  that  has  chamfered
edges).

• Placement   of   a   finger   pinch   sensor   in   the
approximately  11  mm  space  behind  SEMI  E15.1
D1 is recommended.
A1-8  NOTICE: Adjustment of BOLTS/Light Unit
A1-8.1    In  order  to  maintain  quick  interchangeability
and  interoperability  and  quick  attachment/detachment,
adjustment capability should be provided separately by
the box opener/loader and equipment to ensure the port
is   positioned   correctly   with   respect   to   the   wafer
handling robot.
A1-8.2  As a result, adjustment means will be necessary
on  both  the  box  opener/loader  and  the  equipment.  The
box opener/loader may have a capability to calibrate its
critical   dimensions   in   advance,   for   example,   the
parallelism between bottom interface surface and HDP.
In  this  case,  it  is  not  necessary  to  adjust  the  box
opener/loader  after  installation.    The  equipment  should
have  a  capability  to  adjust  bottom  interface  plane  with
respect to the wafer-handling robot. In case of changing
the  box  opener/loader  in  the  field,  adjustment  might
then  not  be  necessary  on  both  the  box  opener/loader
and the equipment side.
A1-8.3  A fixture may help facilitate this adjustment.
A1-8.4  If fine adjustment is  needed  after  reattaching
the  box  opener/loader  (due  to  deficient  adjustment  of
the  box  opener/loader  or  equipment  side),  it  may  be
done  on  the  equipment  side  by  means  of  adjusting
screws or other mechanism at bottom interface plane.
A1-9  NOTICE: Control Connection Area
A1-9.1    Connection  should  be  completed  after  sliding
in   the   box   opener/loader.   Disconnection   should   be
completed before sliding out the box opener/loader.

THE CARRIER ID READER/WRITER FUNCTIONAL STANDARD:
SPECIFICATION OF CONCEPTS, BEHAVIOR, AND SERVICES
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Information  and  Control  Committee  and  is  the
direct  responsibility  of  the  Japanese  Information  and  Control  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the
North  American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  January  10,  2003.  Initially  available  at  www.semi.org
January 2003; to be published March 2003. Originally published February 2000; previously published March

This standard was editorially modified in September 2004 to correct an error. Change was made to Section
R4.1.1.3.
NOTICE:  The designation of SEMI E99 was updated during the 1104 publishing cycle to reflect changes to SEMI
E99.1.
1  Purpose
1. 1  The   purpose   of   the   Carrier   ID   Reader/Writer
Functional  Standard  effort  is  to  provide  a  common
specification   for   concepts,   behavior,   and   services
(functions)  provided  by  a  Carrier  ID  Reader  and  a
Carrier  ID  Reader/Writer  to  an  upstream  controller.  A
standard  interface  will  increase  interchangeability  of
Carrier  ID  Reader/Writers  so  that  users  and  equipment
suppliers have a wider range of choices.
2  Scope
2. 1  The  Carrier  ID  Reader/Writer  Interface  Standard
addresses  the  functional  requirements  for  a  generic
Carrier  ID  Reader/Writer  interface  with  an  upstream
controller.
2. 2  The  specification  includes  required  behavior  and
required  communications  for  both  a  Carrier  ID  Reader
and a Carrier ID Reader/Writer.
2. 3  This   specification   does   not   require,   define,   or
prohibit  asynchronous  messages  sent  by  the  Carrier  ID
Reader or Reader/Writer.
NOTICE: This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  This standard does not define the specific protocol
to    be    used    for    the    Carrier    ID    Reader/Writer.
Supplements  to  this  standard  are  required  to  describe
how  the  functions  of  the  Carrier  ID  Reader/Writer  are
implemented for specific protocols.

6. 1.2  Transition tables are provided in conjunction with the state diagrams to explicitly describe the nature of each
state  transition.    A  transition  table  contains  columns  for  Transition  number,  Previous  State,  Trigger,  New  State,
Actions,  and  Comments.    The  “trigger”  (column  3)  for  the  transition  occurs  while  in  the  “previous”  state.    The
“actions” (column 5) includes a combination of:
• Actions taken upon exit of the previous state.
• Actions taken upon entry of the new state.
• Actions taken which are most closely associated with the transition.
6. 1.2.1  No differentiation is made between these cases.
6. 2  Object Notation
6. 2.1  The  object  models  in  Related  Information  2  use  the  Object  Modeling  Technique  (OMT)  developed  by
Rumbaugh,  James,  et  al,  in  Object-Oriented  Modeling  and  Design.

6. 3  Service Message Representation
6. 3.1  Services  are  functions  or  methods  that  may  be  provided  by  either  the  equipment  or  the  host.    A  service
message may be either a request message, which always requires a response, or a notification message, that does not
require a response.
6. 3.2  Service Definition
6. 3.2.1  A service definition table defines the specific set of messages for a given service resource, as shown in the
following table:

Message Service Name Type Description

Type can be either “N” = Notification or “R” = Request & Response.

6. 3.2.2  Notification type messages are initiated by the service provider (e.g., the equipment) and the provider does
not expect to get a response from the service user.  Request messages are initiated by a service user (e.g., the host).
Request  messages  ask  for  data  or  an  activity  from  the  provider.    Request  messages  expect  a  specific  response
message (no presumption on the message content).
6. 3.3  Service Parameter Dictionary
6. 3.3.1  A  service  parameter  dictionary  table  defines  the  description,  format  and  its  possible  value  for  parameters
used by services, as shown in the following table:

Parameter Name Description Format: Possible Value


6. 3.3.2  A row is provided in the table for each parameter of a service.

6. 3.4  Service Message Definition
6. 3.4.1  A service message definition table defines the parameters used in a service, as shown in the following table:

Parameter Req/Ind Rsp/Cnf Comment


6. 3.4.2  The  columns  labeled  REQ/IND  and  RSP/CNF  link  the  parameters  to  the  direction  of  the  message.  The
message sent by the initiator is called the “Request”. The receiver terms this message the “Indication” or the request.
The receiver may then send a “Response” which the original sender terms the “Confirmation”.
6. 3.4.3  The  following  codes  appear  in  the  REQ/IND  and  RSP/CNF  columns  and  are  used  in  the  definition  of  the
parameters (e.g., how each parameter is used in each direction):

Code                                                                                          Description
M Mandatory Parameter — Must be given a valid value.
C Conditional Parameter — May be defined in some circumstances and undefined in others. Whether a value
is given may be completely optional or may depend on the value of the other parameter.
U               User-Defined               Parameter.
- The parameter is not used.
= (For response only.) Indicates that the value of this parameter in the response must match that in the primary
(if defined).

7  Overview
7. 1  The Carrier ID Reader/Writer Model defines the behavior and services (functions) for both Carrier ID Readers
and  Carrier  ID  Reader/Writers.  The  Carrier  ID  Reader/Writer  is  a  small  intelligent  system,  typically  used  as  a
subsystem within equipment.
7. 1.1  The primary functionality of the Carrier ID Reader/Writer is to read the identifier of the carrier (Carrier ID)
from  the  Carrier  ID  tag.  Various  technologies  may  be  used to encode the Carrier ID and to read it.  Some
technologies do not allow data to be written.
7. 1.2  The acronym CIDRW is used to refer to both the Carrier ID Reader and the Carrier ID Reader/Writer.  The
requirements for the Carrier ID Reader are a subset of the requirements for the Carrier ID Reader/Writer.
7. 1.3  An object model for the CIDRW is provided in Related Information 2 – Object Model.
7. 2  Number of Heads
7. 2.1  A Reader/Writer Head is a device that is positioned on a load port for reading or reading/writing information
from a Carrier ID tag.  A Carrier ID Reader/Writer provides one or more ID Reader/Writer Heads and is connected
to  an  upstream  controller  by  a  single  interface.  This  allows  the  upstream  controller  to  control  either  one  head  or
multiple heads using the same interface specification.
7. 2.2  Single Head Configuration
7. 2.2.1  In the case of a single head, the head may be presented as an integrated part of the CIDRW.
7. 2.3  Multiple Head Configuration
7. 2.3.1  In  the  case  of  multiple  heads,  some  services  are  logically  performed  by  the  CIDRW,  and  the  individual
heads logically perform others.  The individual heads are numbered sequentially and may be referenced individually
by  the  upstream  controller.    Note  that  the  upstream  controller  does  not  communicate  directly  with  the  heads.    All
communications are between the upstream controller and the CIDRW unit.
7. 2.3.2  In  the  multi-head  case,  the  CIDRW  shall  allow  independent  control  of  the  heads.    Multiple  transactions
invoking  services  performed  by  the  individual  heads  may  be  open  at  the  same  time.  For  example,  when  a  read
command  is  sent  to  one  head,  the  host  can  send  additional  commands  such  as  a  read  command  and  a  status
confirmation command to another head before the first head sends the response to the first command.

E
© SEMI 2000, 2004 5
7. 3  Upstream Controller
7. 3.1  The  CIDRW  provides  certain  services  when  requested  by  the  upstream  controller.    The  upstream  controller
sends a message requesting the specified service, and the CIDRW sends a message with the response.
7. 3.2  This  standard  assumes  that  an  upstream  controller  initiates  each  service  message  to  the  CIDRW,  and  the
CIDRW  sends  its  response  to  the  upstream  controller.  The  upstream  controller  must  watch  the  response  time  to
monitor  the  communication  timeout.  This  standard  will  define  the  recommended  method  for  handling  exceptions
caused by timeouts.
7. 3.3  In addition, some CIDRW may provide asynchronous notification to the upstream controller. Examples of this
include, but are not limited to, the detection of a fault condition resulting in an alarm. Asynchronous notification is
not required for compliance to this standard.
8  Attributes
8. 1  An  attribute  is  an  item  of  information  about  an  entity  that  is  maintained  and  is  available  by  request.  There  is
certain  information  concerning  the  CIDRW  that  is  of  potential  interest  to  the  upstream  controller,  including  the
manufacturer,  the  model,  and  the  serial  number  of  the  device.    This  information  is  considered  as  attributes  of  the
CIDRW and is available on request.

9. 3  Read (Write) Head State Model
9. 3.1  For a CIDRW with multiple heads, this state model shall be provided for each Read/Write Head.
9. 3.2  For the single head case, these states are covered in the CIDRW state model and no additional state model for
the head is required.  IDLE and BUSY correspond to substates of the same names in the CIDRW state model.  If any
head is NOT OPERATING, then the active substate of ALARM STATUS in the CIDRW state model is ALARMS.
9. 3.3  The  NOT  OPERATING  state  is  not  required,  if  it  is  not  possible  to  detect  alarms  related  to  the  head.    Note
also that some alarm conditions are fatal (so that the head cannot operate with full functionality) while others may
not be fatal.

10  Alarm Conditions
10. 1  An  alarm  condition  exists  whenever  one  or  more  faults  or  exceptions  that  interfere  with  normal  read/write
operations  is  detected.    A  maintenance  condition  exists  when  the  CIDRW  determines  the  need  for  either
maintenance (repair) or preventive maintenance activities.
10. 2  The  CIDRW  is  able  to  detect  and  report  alarm  conditions  through  its  status  attributes  (when  queried  by  the
upstream controller).  It may additionally report changes in alarm conditions asynchronously through alarm or event
reports.

11. 4.12  Service Operability
11. 4.13  Some services are performed by the CIDRW and others are logically performed by the individual heads. It
is expected that the CIDRW will support multiple interleaved transactions to the various independent logical units.
Table 19 shows which of the various services can be performed by the CIDRW when the CIDRW and its heads are
in various individual states. Note that when in the initializing state after powerup or the reset service, the CIDRW
may not be able to communicate.

OBJECT MODEL
NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E99. This related information was approved for
publication by full letter ballot procedures on August 28, 2000.
R2-1    Object  models  provide  a  graphic  representation  of  entities.    The  models  in  this  section  use  the  Object
Modeling  Technique  (OMT)  described  in  Object-Oriented  Modeling  and  Design.    Object  types  are  represented  by
rectangles with one, two, or three sections.  The name of the object type is in the first, or only section.  Attributes,
information about the object, are shown in the second section.  Operations or services are shown in a third section.
Lines between objects represent relationships.
R2-2  Three models are shown for purposes of illustration.  The general multi-head case is shown first with only the
required  attributes  and  services.    Next,  the  full  model  for  the  multi-head  case  is  shown  with  all  attributes  and
services defined in this standard.  Finally, the full model for the integrated single-head case is shown.
R2-3    Note  that  the  Upstream  Controller  sends  all  service  requests  to  the  CIDRW  controller,  including  services
shown  for  the  individual  heads.  Services  shown  on  these  models  for  CIDRW  are  those  with  a  Head  ID  service
parameter  value  of  zero  while  services  shown  for  the  Head  are  those  with  a  Head  ID  service  parameter  value
between one and thirty-one.
R2-4  Fundamental Requirements Example Object Models
R2-4.1  The object model in Figure R2-1 shows objects for the general (multi-head) CIDRW satisfying fundamental
requirements only.  It shows the CIDRW subsystem as made up of one or more heads.  It also illustrates the required

NOTICE:    This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E99  and  was  derived  from  the  Japanese
Information and Control Committee.  This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot on
January 10, 2003.
R4-1  Application of RF Tag as Carrier ID Tag
R4-1.1  In case that RF Tag is utilized as Carrier Tag for SEMI E99 application, to secure the interoperability among
the CIDRW units for writing / reading the Carrier ID into / out of the RF Tag, some basic consideration should be
taken as follows:
R4-1.1.1  Coincidence of Carrier ID Written and Read in Tag Memory
— Fundamentally Carrier ID, which is read
out, should be quite same as written, with no addition.

R4-1.1.2  Caution for Carrier ID Contents Applied to Object ID — Carrier ID as Material ID can be used as Object
ID.  But  the  Space  Character  (20
16
)  should  not  be  used  as  the  first  or  the  last  character  of  Carrier  ID.  SEMI  E39
restricts these.

R4-1.1.3    Non-Visible Character in Carrier ID  —  If  non-visible  ASCII  character  is  found  within  the  specified  tag
area, CIDRW shall send out an error (i.e. Execution error) to the upstream controller when “Read ID” service was
executed. The contents of Carrier ID issued by host/upstream controller should be compliant with visible Character.

R4-1.1.4    Location of Carrier ID Field (CID  Field)  —  Carrier  ID  field  shall  be  located  from  the  first  byte  to  the
maximum byte of Carrier ID in the memory of  the Electric Tag.  The relation of Carrier ID Offset and Carrier ID
length are shown bellow:

Example of Carrier ID in Tag (“CID = ABCDE”)

R4-1.1.5    Condition of CarrierIDOffset and CarrierIDLength —
By  setting  the  condition  of  CarrierIDOffset  and
CarrierIDLength, CIDRW can correspond to CarrierID Tag characteristic to device makers already existing, if they
are compliant with the reinforced specification for RF Tag in SEMI E99.
R4-1.1.5.1  The information of the Offset value and Length of Carrier ID should be stored as the CIDRW Attribute.
R4-1.1.5.2    When  a  CIDRW  is  installed  in  the  equipment,  it  needs  to  set  up  a  condition  of  CarrirIDOffset  and
CarrierIDLength as per user requirement once at least.

SPECIFICATION FOR A RETICLE SMIF POD (RSP) USED TO
TRANSPORT AND STORE 6 INCH OR 230 mm RETICLES
This specification was technically approved by the Global Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee and is
the direct responsibility of the North American Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee. Current edition
approved  by  the  North  American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  16,  2004.  Initially  available  at
www.semi.org  September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.  Originally  published  February  2000,
previously published March 2002.
1  Purpose
1. 1  This   standard   specifies   the   Reticle   SMIF   Pod
(RSP)  used  to  transport  and  store  6  inch  or  230  mm
reticles  in  a  reticle  (photomask)  or  integrated  circuit
(IC) manufacturing facility.
2  Scope
2. 1  This standard is intended to set an appropriate level
of    specification    that    places    minimal    limits    on
innovation    while    ensuring    modularity    and    inter-
changeability  at  all  mechanical interfaces.  Most of the
requirements given in this specification are in the form
of  maximum  or  minimum  dimensions  with  very  few
required  surfaces.  Only  the  physical  interfaces  for  the
RSP are specified; no materials requirements or micro-
contamination limits are given in this specification.
2. 2  The pellicle exclusion volumes of this specification
accommodate  pellicles  which  extend  the  full  length  of
the  reticles.    The  pellicle  exclusion  volume  widths  are
limited to 151 mm for 230 mm reticles, and 129 mm for
6 inch reticles.
2. 3  The   RSP   has   the   following   components,   sub-
components, and other features. A “●” symbol indicates
components  or  features  which  are  required  and  a  “◊”
symbol  indicates  components  or  features  which  are
optional.
• Top
◊ robotic handling flange (optional)
• Interior
• supports for one 6 inch or 230 mm reticle
• reticle capture mechanism
• end-effector exclusion volume
• 2 safety rail exclusion volumes

pins
• carrier sensing pads as defined in SEMI E1.9
•
4 info pads
◊ 4 bottom conveyor rails
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

4  Terminology
4. 1  Definitions
4. 1.1  bilateral  reference  plane  —  a  vertical  plane  that
bisects  the  reticle  and  is  perpendicular  to  both  the
horizontal  and  facial  reference  planes.  The  bilateral
reference  plane  is  coplanar  with  the  bilateral  datum
plane defined in SEMI E57.
4. 1.2  facial  reference  plane  —  a  vertical  plane  which
bisects the reticle and is parallel to the front side of the
pod (where reticles are removed or inserted). The facial
reference   plane   passes   through   the   center   of   the
200  mm  SMIF  as  defined  in  SEMI  E19.4.  The  facial
reference  plane  is  coplanar  with  the  facial  datum  plane
defined in SEMI E57.
4. 1.3  horizontal  reference  plane  —  a  horizontal  plane
coplanar with the top surface of the port door as defined
in   SEMI   E19.4.   The   horizontal   reference   plane   is
coplanar  with  the  horizontal  datum  plane  defined  in
SEMI E57.
4. 1.4  minienvironment   —   a   localized   environment
created  by  an  enclosure  to  isolate  the  product  from
contamination and people.
4. 1.5  nominal  reticle  center  line  —  the  line  that  is
defined by the intersection of the two vertical reference
planes  (facial  and  bilateral)  and  passes  through  the
nominal  center  of  the  seated  reticle  (which  must  be
horizontal  when  the  carrier  is  placed  on  the  SMIF  as
defined in SEMI E19.4).
4. 1.6  pellicle — as defined in SEMI P5.
4. 1.7  reticle — as defined in SEMI E30.1.
4. 1.8  Reticle  SMIF  Pod  (RSP)  —  a  minienvironment
compatible carrier capable of holding one 6 inch or one
230   mm   reticle   in   a   horizontal   orientation   during
transport and storage and is compatible with a Standard
Mechanical Interface (SMIF) per SEMI E19.4.
4. 1.9  robotic      handling      flanges      —      horizontal
projections on the top of the box for lifting and rotating
the box (as defined in SEMI E47.1).
4. 1.10  side  handling  flanges  —  horizontal  projections
on  the  sides  of  the  pod  (sides  parallel  to  the  bilateral
reference   plane)   for   manual   or   automated   lifting,
transportation or positioning of the pod.
5  Ordering Information
5. 1  Intended   Use   —   This   standard   is   intended   to
specify reticle carriers over a reasonable lifetime of use,
not  just  those  in  new  condition.    For  this  reason,  the
purchaser   needs   to   specify   a   time   period   and   the
number  and  type  of  uses  to  which  the  carriers  will  be
put.    It  is  under  these  conditions  that  the  carriers  must
remain  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  listed  in
Section 6.
5. 2  Reticle Size and Thickness — The purchaser  needs
to   specify   the   reticle   size   and   thickness   to   be
accommodated in the RSP.
5. 3  Optional   Features   —   The   purchaser   needs   to
specify   whether   optional   components   (identified   in
Section 2) are required.
5. 4  Temperature  Ranges  —  The  purchaser  needs  to
specify  two  sets  of  temperatures  to  which  the  RSPs
might  be  exposed.  An  operating  temperature  range  is
the  set  of  environmental  temperatures  in  which  the
RSPs  will  remain  in  compliance  with  the  requirements
listed  in  Section  6.    A  temporary  temperature  range  is
the set of environmental temperatures to which the pods
can  be  exposed  such  that  when  the  RSPs  return  to  the
operating   temperature   range,   the   RSPs   will   be   in
compliance  with  the  requirements  listed  in  Section  6.
Limits   on   exposure   times   to   elevated   temperatures
should be specified.
5. 5  Electrostatic  Dissipation  —  The  end  user  may
require  a  continuous  path  to  ground  from  the  reticle  to
the  carrier  registration  and  handling  features.    The
purchaser    needs    to    specify    whether    electrostatic
dissipation is required.
5. 6  Contamination   Requirements   —   The   purchaser
needs to specify their contamination requirements.
6  Requirements
6. 1  Symmetry  —  Most  of  the  dimensions  of  the  RSP
are  determined  with  respect  to  the  three  orthogonal
reference  planes  defined  in  this  document:    the  facial
reference  plane,  the  horizontal  reference  plane  and  the
bilateral reference plane.  All dimensions are symmetric
about  the  bilateral  reference  plane  except  the  latch
features.  All dimensions are symmetric about the facial
reference  plane  except  the  registration  features,  carrier
sensing pads, info pads, and latch features.
6. 2  Door — The pod door, and its frame on the bottom
of  the  pod,  must  be  compatible  with  a  port  which
conforms to SEMI E19.4.
6. 3  Reticle Centering and Capture — When the carrier
is  closed,  the  reticle  must  be  secured  in  all  degrees  of
freedom within the carrier to prevent movement during
transport and must be centered with respect to the SMIF
defined in SEMI E19.4.  A bisecting plane through the
reticle,  parallel  to  the  bilateral  reference  plane  must  be
within x114  of  the  bilateral  reference  plane  of  the  load
port  when  the  reticle  is  seated  in  the  carrier.    A


SEMI E100-1104 © SEMI 2000, 2004 3
bisecting plane through the reticle, parallel to the facial
reference  plane  must  be  within  y133  of  the  facial
reference  plane  of  the  load  port  when  the  reticle  is
seated in the carrier. When the carrier is open,  it must
provide  a  horizontal  reticle  capture  range  of  x135  and
y135.    This  capture  range  must  be  provided  at  z162
above the horizontal reference plane.
6. 4  Exclusion Volumes — The interior of the RSP must
never  intrude  into  the  pellicle  exclusion  volumes,  and
must   not   intrude   into   the   end-effector   exclusion
volumes  or  safety  rail  exclusion  volumes  when  the
carrier  is  open.    Where  the  exclusion  volumes  overlap,
the  end-effector  exclusion  volume  is  reduced  by  the
pellicle  exclusion  volume  when  handling  pelliclized  or
chrome-down reticles.
6. 4.1  End-Effector  Exclusion  Volumes  —  Volumes  in
an  opened  pod  which  must  be  free  for  the  end-effector
to enter and handle the reticle as defined by x116, x132,
y136, x144, x146, y144, z159,  and  z160  for  a  230  mm
RSP, and by x118, x143, x145, y143, z159, and z160 for
a 6 inch RSP.  No obstructions should exist in the end-
effector   exclusion   volume   which   extends   in   the
direction normal to the facial reference plane.
6. 4.2  Pellicle  Exclusion  Volumes  —  Volumes  in  the
pod  below  the  reticle  which  must  remain  free  from
intrusion  to  accommodate  the  pellicle  mounted  on  the
reticle.  No  obstructions  should  exist  in  the  pellicle
exclusion volume which extends in the direction normal
to  the  facial  reference  plane  as  defined  by  x115, z159
and z161  for  a  230  mm  RSP,  and  by  x119, z159  and
z161 for a 6 inch RSP.  No obstructions should exist in
the transverse pellicle exclusion volume which extends
in  the  direction  normal  to  the  bilateral  reference  plane
as defined by y129, z159  and  z163 for a 230 mm RSP,
and by y130, z
159 and z163 for a 6 inch RSP.
NOTE 1:  The  transverse  pellicle  exclusion  volume  is  only
intended  to  specify  where  the  reticle  supports  in  the  pod
cannot   exist.      Reticles   with   the   pellicles   transverse   are
typically  handled  with  end-effectors  which  grip  from  above
the reticle.
6. 4.3  Safety Rail Exclusion Volumes — Volumes in an
opened  pod  which  must  remain  free  from  intrusion  to
accommodate  safety  rails  which  may  be  used  on  end-
effectors   to   protect   the   edge   of   the   reticle   during
handling.        No  obstructions  should  exist  in  the  safety
rail  exclusion  volumes  which  extend  in  the  direction
normal to the facial reference plane as defined by x137
and z167  for  a  230  mm,  and  by  x138  and  z167  for  a  6
inch RSP.
6. 5  External  Dimensions  —  Figures  1,  2  and  3  show,
respectively,  the  external  top  view,  a  detail  and  the
front  view  of  the  RSP.    Table  2  defines  all  of  the
external dimensions of the RSP (equivalent for both the
6 inch and the 230 mm versions).
6. 6  Internal  Dimensions  —  Figures  4  through  8  show
internal dimensions for the 6 inch and 230 mm versions
of  the  RSP.    Table  2  defines  all  internal  dimensions
which  are  common  to  the  6  inch  and  230  mm  RSP.
Table  3  defines  the  internal  dimensions  which  apply
only  to  the  230  mm  RSP.  Table  4  defines  the  internal
dimensions  which  apply  only  to  the  6  inch  RSP.    The
maximum  height  of  the  features  which  support  the
reticle  are  given  by  z164  for  a  230  mm  RSP  and  z165
for a 6 inch RSP.
NOTE 2:  The  maximum  height  of  the  reticle  supports,  plus
the clearance between the reticle supports and reticle (chosen
by the tool supplier) determine the  height the reticle must be
lifted before being extracted from, or inserted into the RSP.
6. 7  Robotic Handling Flange — On the top of the pod
is    an    optional    handling    flange    for    automated
manipulation  of  the  RSP.    Figures  1,  3,  and  5  show
dimensions  for  the  robotic  handling  flange.  Table  2
defines the dimensions for the robotic handling flange.
6. 8  Side  Handling  Flanges  —  On  the  sides  of  the  pod
parallel  to  the  bilateral  reference  plane  are  optional
handling  flanges  for  automated  manipulation  of  the
RSP.  Figures 1, 2, and 3 show dimensions for the side
handling flanges. Table 2 defines the dimensions for the
side handling flanges. No obstructions may exist in the
side  handling  exclusion  volumes  which  extend  in  the
direction normal to the facial reference plane as defined
by x136  and  z166  when  the  side  handling  flanges  are
present.
6. 9  Kinematic  Coupling  —  The  RSP  door  must  have
the   capability   of   registering   on   the   kinematic   pins
defined  in  SEMI  E57.  The  features  that  mate  with  the
pins  must  provide  a  lead-in  capability  that  corrects  an
RSP misalignment no greater than r19 in any horizontal
direction.    However,  it  is  recommended  that  robots
placing RSPs on kinematic couplings use as little of this
lead-in capability as possible to avoid wear.
6. 10  Carrier Sensing Pads — The RSP door must have
carrier sensing pads as defined in SEMI E1.9.
6. 11  Info  Pads  —  When  the  RSP  is  placed  on  a  port,
the info pads A, B, C, and D communicate information
about the RSP configuration.  Figures 6 and 8 show the
dimensions  of  the  info  pads.    Table  2  defines  the  info
pad dimensions.  A pad in the up position must be z26
above  the  horizontal  reference  plane.    A  pad  in  the
down   position   must   be   z2   above   the   horizontal
reference  plane.    Info  pad  assignments  are  shown  in
Table  1.    Info  pads  that  are  “not  defined”  can  be  at
either  the  up  or  down  position  unless  specified  by  the
end user.  RSP configurations “to be assigned” may be
assigned by the end user.

6. 12  Inner  and  Outer  Radii  —  All  required  concave
features  may  have  a  radius  of  up  to  r65  to  allow
cleaning  and  to  prevent  contaminant  build-up.    All
required  convex  features  may  also  have  a  radius  of  up
to r66  to  prevent  small  contact  patches  with  large
stresses that might cause wear and particles.  Note that
these  limits  on  the  radius  of  all  required  features  are
specified as a maximum (not a minimum) to ensure that
the required features are not rounded off too much.  The
lower  bound  on  the  radius  is  up  to  the  carrier  supplier.
Note  also  that  this  radius  applies  to  every  required
feature  unless  another  radius  is  called  out  specifically.
Here a required feature is an area on the surface of the
carrier  specified  by  a  dimension  (or  intersections  of
dimensions)   that   has   a   tolerance   and   not   just   a
maximum or minimum (such as the edges of the robotic
handling flange).
6. 13  Carrier ID Exclusion Volume — Volume external
to  the  pod  which  must  remain  free  from  intrusion  to
accommodate  a  carrier  ID  label  or  tag  mounted  on  the
pod.    No  obstructions  should  exist  in  the  carrier  ID
exclusion volume as defined by x147, y137, y138, z180,
and z181.    Figures  1  and  3  show  dimensions  for  the
carrier   ID   exclusion   volume.   Table   2   defines   the
dimensions  for  the  carrier  ID  exclusion  volume.    If  a
label is used, its surface must be at y139.
6. 14  Conveyor   Rails   —   Optional   surfaces   on   the
bottom  for  transporting  the  RSP  on  roller  conveyors.
The conveyor rail surfaces are bounded by x140, x141,
x142, y140, y141  and  y142  as  shown  in  Figure  9.    The
height  of  the  conveyor  rail  surface  is  defined  by  z171.
Table 2 defines the dimensions for the conveyor rails.

APPENDIX 1
APPLICATION NOTES
NOTICE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E100  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot
procedures on September 3 and December 15, 1999 by the North American Regional Standards Committee, but the
recommendations in this appendix are optional and are not required to conform to this standard.
A1-1      Edge   contact   only   with   the   photomask   is
preferred when handling, transporting, or storing.
A1-2  Skewness, warp, rock, and stiffness are implicitly
defined in the geometric tolerances.
A1-3  A 6 inch reticle with a 140 mm wide pellicle can
be   accommodated   in   the   RSP,   but   may   require
automation which approaches from above the reticle.
A1-4    Features  on  the  RSP  which  enable  stacking  may
be  required    by  end  users.    It  is  preferred  that  these
features allowing stacking in only one orientation.
A1-5      Features   on   the   RSP   which   provide   visual
orientation  of  the  RSP  top  and  RSP  door  may  be
required by end users.
A1-6    In  order  to  permit  end-effectors,  which  can
handle  both  230  mm  and  6  inch  reticles,  it  is  recom-
mended  to  include  the  230  mm  end-effector  exclusion
volumes in RSPs configured for 6 inch reticles.
