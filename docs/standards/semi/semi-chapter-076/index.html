6  Philosophy
6. 1  Gaseous     mixtures     potentially     emitted     from
numerous  processes  could  also  produce  hazards  within
exhaust ducts.
6. 2  With  increasing  legal  requirements  worldwide  on
both    worker    safety    and    general    environmental
protection,   more   effective   exhaust   management   is
required.
6. 3  This   demands   a   detailed   understanding   of   the
chemical   and   physical   properties   of   the   chemical
compounds  being  emitted  from  processes,  and  of  the
conditions under which they are released.
6. 4  Careful design of the abatement systems is required
to attain both high efficiency and maximum economy.
7  Classification of Emissions
7. 1  The    following    fundamental    points    regarding
exhaust emissions should be considered:
• Exhaust  contaminants  might  be  solely  the  material
used  in  the  process  (e.g.,  isopropyl  alcohol  (IPA)
from a rinse chamber)
• In  plasma  and  thermal  chambers  many  reactions
occur,  both  those  desired  and  others;  therefore  by-
products   are   also   key   components   of   exhaust
emissions.
• In   theory,   most   possible   combinations   of   the
elements   in   the   input   gases   may   be   found   as
compounds  in  the  exhaust.  In  practice,  the  main
components  will  be  the  unused  process  gas  (the
percentage  consumed  in  the  process  varies,  and</p><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 20013
may  be  as  low  as  10%).    Additional  by-products
will  have  different  and  sometimes  more  hazardous
properties.
7. 2  Considerable   research   has   been   conducted   into
various   hazardous   by-products   of   processes,   from
explosive  solids  to  organochlorine  compounds  with
mutagenic   properties.      (See   Sections   13.1   through
13. 3.)
7. 3  In  considering  selection  of  exhaust  systems  and
abatement  technology,  it  is  essential  to  review  all  the
materials likely to be present in the exhaust.
7. 4  Contributions from the materials on the wafer must
also   be   considered,   as   they   often   cause   blocked
exhausts   (e.g.,   aluminum   etches   produce   aluminum
chloride  (a  by-product  of  removal  of  aluminum  from
the wafer with chlorinated gases)).
7. 5  Processes   that   produce   specific   hazardous   by-
products  should  be  evaluated  for  appropriate  point-of-
use   abatement   technology   before   discharge   to   an
exhaust system.
7. 6  Gaseous and particulate contaminants emitted from
semiconductor      manufacturing      can      be      divided
conveniently  into  nine  major  groups,  each  of  which
might justify its own exhaust system.
7. 6.1  Group-1 Acid — Easily hydrolyzable acids, (e.g.,
hydrogen chloride hydrolyzes into hydrochloric acid.)
7. 6.2  Group-2 Acid aerosols (“difficult–to-scrub”)  —
This  group  includes  acids  that  generate  aerosols  and
that  are  not  easily  removed  by  simple  water  scrubbers
(e.g., aqua regia, sulfuric and nitric).
NOTE 2: High concentrations of easily soluble acids will also
fall into the “difficult-to-scrub” category.
7. 6.3  Group-3     Ammonia      —      Exhaust      streams
containing ammonia
7. 6.4  Group-4  Volatile  Organic  Compounds  (VOCs)
—   Exhausts   containing   volatile   organic   compound
vapors     or     flammable     gas     discharge     requiring
destruction.
7. 6.5  Group-5   Pyrophoric   —   Exhausts   containing
pyrophoric gases.
7. 6.6  Group-6   Emergency   Release   Discharges —
Enclosures  are  provided  with  additional  exhausts  to
contain   sudden   unanticipated   releases   of   gas   from
cylinders, etc.
7. 6.7  Group-7  Special/Direct  —  Additional  exhausts
used   to   keep   specific   gases   separate   for   recovery
purposes  (e.g.,  hydrogen  (H
2
)  reclamation  from  EPI  or
PFC  reclamation  from  CVD  tools,  Oxides  of  Nitrogen
(NO
x
)).
7. 6.8  Group-8  General  Exhaust  Systems  without  End-
of-Pipe Treatment — Exhaust of heat or post-treatment
exhaust from POU abatement systems.
7. 6.9  Group-9  Highly  Toxic  Gas  Exhaust  —  Highly
toxic    gases    especially    those    with    poor    warning
properties  (e.g.,  arsine,  phosphine,  diborane,  germane).
The  end  user  has  a  primary  responsibility  to  prevent
discharge  of  these  gases  above  a  regulated  level  (e.g.,
usually  one-half  (1/2)  of  Immediately  Dangerous  to
Life and Health (IDLH) levels).
NOTE 3: Facility exhaust systems may be called by a number
of   different   names   such   as:   Acid,   Corrosive,   Ammonia,
Scrubbed,  VOC,  Solvent,  Incinerated,  Highly  Toxic,  Toxic,
Dedicated,  Special,  PFC,  General,  Heat,  Treated,  or  others.
The actual facility exhaust system name, and what groups are
routed to each system, will vary by factory and by country.
7. 7  The groups listed in Section 7.6 are not a definitive
division,   but   represent   a   summation   of   common
industry  practice  for  separation.    The  division  is  based
on three basic principles:
• avoiding   mixing   of   incompatible   gases   in   the
exhaust,
• potential  need  for  different  end-of-pipe  abatement
technologies, and,
• keeping materials separate for recovery.
7. 8  The  number  of  separate  exhaust  systems  used  is
entirely   a   decision   for   each   facility,   based   on   the
following:
• processes and chemicals used,
• the number of each type of process,
• whether recovery of gases is required,
• whether point-of-use (POU) abatement is installed,
and
• compatibility  of  emissions  with  each  other  or  the
effluent handling system.
7. 9  In  theory,  if  POU  abatement  systems  are  fitted  to
all sources of gaseous effluent all exhaust could then be
combined into a single exhaust system.
7. 9.1  In  practice  most  facilities  operate  a  compromise
between  the  two  extremes  with  two  to  four  separate
exhaust  systems  and  point-of-use  abatement  systems
fitted only to certain sources.  The decision (as to which
combination  to  use)  will  often  be  based  on  economic
and space constraints.
7. 9.2  Safety  and  environmental  factors  listed  below,
should  always  be  considered  first  when  determining
specific  gaseous  sources  that  require  POU  abatement
systems.</p><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 20014
7. 10  Many types of process equipment use and exhaust
incompatible  gases  sequentially  (e.g.,  silane  and  then
nitrogen  trifluoride  (NF
3
)  as  elements  of  a  deposition
and cleaning cycle).
7. 10.1  With  more  than  one  of  these  processes  being
discharged   asynchronously   into   a   common   exhaust
duct, undesired reactions may occur.
7. 10.2  It is possible to avoid this problem by fitting the
equipment  outlet  with  three-way  valves  to  divert  the
discharge  to  the  correct  exhaust  system,  depending  on
equipment  process  step.    Three-way  valves  may  not  be
necessary if pump ballast-gas flow is increased to dilute
gases.
7. 10.2.1  Switching must accurately account for the gas
transmission  times  from  process  chamber  inlet  to  the
exhaust valve.
7. 10.2.2  Introduction  of  additional  mechanical  devices
could  create  major  hazards,  reliability,  and  service  or
maintenance issues.
7. 10.2.3  Valves  must  incorporate  failsafe  designs  to
ensure pump outlet is not shut off.
7. 10.3  An  alternative  solution  is  to  fit  a  local  POU
abatement system that treats at least one component and
is not adversely affected by the other components.
7. 11  Point-of-Use (POU) Abatement Devices
7. 11.1  POU abatement devices are designed to operate
at  the  process  tool  or  pump  outlet,  and  to  remove
hazardous   gases   BEFORE   they   enter   the   exhaust
ductwork.
7. 11.2  An  end-of-pipe  scrubber  does  not  protect  the
facility  from  reactions  in  the  ductwork.    Reactions
between process gases, as discussed above, or reactions
with  other  process  by-products  within  the  ductwork
itself are not prevented by end-of-pipe systems either.
7. 11.3  POU   abatement   devices   may   be   appropriate
wherever the exhaust gases can react in the ductwork.
7. 11.4  If  process  systems  are  not  treated  with  POU
abatement    devices,    the    higher    concentrations    of
hazardous gases will present a higher risk during a leak
into the facility space.
7. 11.5  Improperly functioning POU abatement devices
can  create  backpressure  that  can  increase  the  risk  of  a
leak.
7. 12  Four  significant  consequences  can  be  foreseen
from effluent gas reactions in the ductwork:
7. 12.1  Blocked  Ducts  —  Reactions  between  gases,  or
condensation  of  vapors,  can  produce  solids  and  semi-
solids  (such  as  crystals,  slurries  or  gels)  that  will  block
the ductwork.
7. 12.1.1  Collection   of   solids   can   create   dead   leg
sections that may contain reactive byproducts or unused
raw  materials.    Catastrophic  release  of  these  trapped
materials could generate a significant hazard.
7. 12.1.2  Extensive  downtime  (for  clean  out,  or  ducts
collapsing under the weight of accumulated solids) is a
possible undesirable outcome of this condition.
7. 12.1.3  Solids  deposited  (such  as  from  metal  etching)
can,   themselves,   be   both   corrosive   and   hazardous,
leading  to  health  risks  for  people  performing  cleaning
in  ductwork.    (See  Related  Documents  13.1  through
13. 3).
7. 12.1.4  Blocked  ducts  may  result  in  toxic  process
gases or by products escaping into the work area.
7. 12.2  Duct  Corrosion  —  Etching  and  some  chamber
cleaning process emissions are corrosive.  Both metallic
(including  stainless  steel)  and  plastic  ducting  can  be
attacked,  resulting  in  the  release  of  hazardous  gas  or
condensed liquids into the workplace.
7. 12.3  Duct  Fires  or  Explosions  —  Flammable  and
pyrophoric  gases  can  ignite  in  the  ductwork.    If  the
ductwork    is    combustible    or    has    flammable    or
combustible deposits in it (e.g., hydrocarbon pump oil),
facility fires can result.
7. 12.4  Additional     information     on     protection     of
Industrial  Exhaust  systems  from  fires  may  be  found  in
FM    Global    Loss    Prevention    Data    Sheet    7-78,
“Industrial Exhaust Systems”.
NOTE 4: Destruction  of  whole  production  lines  with  multi-
million dollar cost impact has resulted from such incidents.
7. 12.5  Formation   of   Ammonium   Compounds   —   If
ammonia    is    discharged    into    a    duct    with    acid
compounds,  a  sub-micron  ammonium  compound  fume
can be generated, that is not easily removed by end-of-
pipe systems.
7. 12.5.1  The result is visible discharges.
7. 12.5.2  Ammonium  compounds  produce  solids  in  the
duct.
7. 13  If  any  of  the  above  reactions  can  occur  in  the
process exhaust, POU abatement should be considered.
7. 14  Exhausts  of  oil-lubricated  vacuum  pumps  should
be   fitted   with   well-maintained   oil   mist   separators/
filters.
7. 15  POU   abatement   devices   may   also   be   needed
upstream  of  the  recovery  device  for  the  recovery  of
some  gaseous  compounds    (e.g.,  hydrogen  (H
2
),  PFC
gases).</p><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 20015
8  End-of-Pipe Abatement Technologies
8. 1  Group 1 —  Acid Abatement
8. 1.1  The  appropriate  abatement  technology  for  this
category is commonly called &quot;wet scrubbing.&quot;
8. 1.2  Many,  if  not  all,  of  the  semiconductor  processes
have  traditionally  been  exhausted  through  centralized
wet scrubbers.
8. 1.2.1  This      procedure      has      limited      technical
acceptability  and  may  not  meet  the  requirements  of  all
regulatory agencies.
8. 1.2.2  This    technology    should    be    targeted    at
abatement  of  acid  gases,  vapors,  mists,  and  fumes
emitted  from  CVD,  dry  etching,  and  wet  chemical
operations.
8. 1.2.3  Most   wet   chemical   processes   are   typically
carried out under local exhaust ventilation devices, such
as  fume  hoods,  or  in  specially  designed  rooms  that  are
totally exhausted.  These types of operations include:
• Processes  used  to  clean  wafers  or  clean  wafer
handling  equipment  (such  as  quartz  components,
tubing),
• Processes  used  in  wafer  fabrication  for  surface
treatment  such  as  oxide,  silicon  nitride  and  other
surface treatments, (e.g., metal etching), and
• Processes    used    for    development    of    positive
photoresist.
8. 1.2.4  The  chemical  species  emitted  depends  on  both
the  chemicals  used  in  the  processes  and  the  conditions
of use.
8. 1.2.5  Volatile    acids    (e.g.,    hydrochloric    (HCl),
hydrofluoric,  nitric,  and  acetic)  yield  corresponding
gases and vapors, especially when heated.
8. 1.2.5.1  The  reaction  of  hydrochloric  and  nitric  acids
in aqua regia yields nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) vapor and
elemental chlorine (Cl
2
) gas.
8. 1.2.5.2  When  sulfuric  acid  is  heated,  it  yields  both
sulfuric acid vapor (H
2
SO
4
) and sulfur trioxide (SO
3
).
8. 1.2.5.3  Phosphoric  acid  (H
3
PO
4
)  is  not  significantly
volatile, but spray may be carried over into the exhaust
system by mechanical entrainment.
8. 1.2.5.4  Under  appropriate  conditions,  spray  droplets
of  any  of  the  chemicals  used  may  be  mechanically
entrained  into  the  ventilation  air  exhausted  from  the
various processes.
8. 1.3  Design  and  selection  of  scrubbing  equipment  for
the  acid  exhaust  systems  must  take  into  account  both
the  chemical  and  physical  properties  of  the  materials
being emitted.
8. 1.4  The    principles    involved    in    collection    of
particulate    matter    (including    liquid    aerosols)    are
entirely  different  from  those  determining  absorption  of
gases.
8. 1.5  Current Practice
8. 1.5.1  Exhausts  carrying  acid  compounds  comprise
the  largest  volume  of  air  discharged  from  a  typical
semiconductor manufacturing plant.
8. 1.5.2  The current practice is to connect most or all of
the  corrosive  sources  to  a  central  building  exhaust
system  and  to  discharge  the  combined  gas  streams  to
one or more large wet scrubbers.
8. 1.5.2.1  A  variety  of  scrubber  types  might  be  used,
but  the  two  main  types  are  cross-flow  and  counter-
current  scrubbers  equipped  with  packing  material  of
some type.
8. 1.5.3  The  scrubbers  usually  are  fed  with  a  stream  of
water (potable, recycled, etc.).
8. 1.5.4  A   side   stream   of   water   is   bled   from   the
scrubber to a wastewater line.
8. 1.5.5  It  is  futile  to  discharge  organic  solvents  to
water  scrubbers  even  if  the  organic  solvents  are,  to
some degree, soluble in water.
8. 1.5.5.1  Any dissolved organic solvent will eventually
be  desorbed  from  the  water  and  will  escape  to  the
atmosphere,     or     be     discharged     as     wastewater.
Additionally,  these  organics  could  serve  to  propagate
biological growth in the scrubber.
8. 1.5.6  Exhausts   from   process   tools   are   frequently
discharged to the appropriate building exhaust systems,
either with or without point-of-use abatement.
8. 1.5.7  Arsine  and  phosphine,  which  have  only  slight
solubility in water, pass through the water scrubbers so
that  the  effect  of  discharging  these  gases  into  the
building    scrubber    system    is    limited    to    dilution.
Fluorine  and  chlorine  also  have  limited  solubility  in
water  and  may  pass  through  water  scrubbers  without
sufficient  abatement.    POU  abatement  devices  should
be considered for these types of gases.
8. 1.5.8  Preliminary  oxidation  of  these  and  numerous
other  process  gases  results  in  formation  of  fine  fumes
and  other  aerosols  that  will  be  collected  with  only  low
efficiencies   by   the   typical   large,   low-energy   wet
scrubbers.
8. 1.5.9  If  ammonia  is  discharged  into  a  system  that
also carries hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, nitric
acid, or sulfuric acid; it will react, in the vapor phase, to</p><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 20016
form sub-micron solid aerosols of ammonium chloride,
ammonium  fluoride,  ammonium  nitrate,  or  ammonium
sulfate, respectively.
8. 1.5.10  Any  exhausts  carrying  ammonia  should  be
discharged  to  a  separate  scrubber  or  a  point-of-use
ammonia abatement used at the process discharge.
8. 1.6  Chemistry of Pollutants
8. 1.6.1  Effective  abatement  of  any  compound  requires
careful  consideration  of  the  chemistries  and  physical
states of the specific compounds being abated.
8. 1.6.2  The packed-bed scrubbers commonly employed
should  generally  be  adequate  for  absorption  of  readily
soluble  gases,  if  appropriate  operating  conditions  are
also maintained.
8. 1.6.3  Misuse can negate the potential performance of
the scrubbers.
8. 1.6.4  As  scrubbers  are  low-energy  devices  (pressure
drops on the order of 2.5 to 10 cm (1-4 inches) of water,
they are incapable of effectively collecting fine aerosols
such as the ammonium salts mentioned above.
8. 1.6.5  The most economic design approach, therefore,
is   to   arrange   the   exhaust   system   and   use   POU
abatement devices to avoid formation of such aerosols,
where possible.
8. 1.6.6  The practice of using only recirculated water in
the scrubber, to absorb acid vapors and to neutralize the
water  bleed  stream  should  be  reviewed  to  ensure  that
scrubber efficiency is not affected.
8. 1.6.7  Acid  gases,  such  as  hydrogen  chloride  and
hydrogen  fluoride,  are  readily  soluble  in  water.  The
partial  pressure  of  acid  gases  in  equilibrium  with  the
solution,    which    increases    with    increasing    solute
concentration, reduces the absorption of additional gas.
Reduction    in    absorption    can    be    minimized    by
increasing the rate of water blow-down (i.e., using more
fresh water make-up).
8. 1.6.8  However,  increasing  the  rate  proportionately
increases  the  consumption  of  water  and  the  volume  of
water   that   must   be   treated   before   discharge   as
wastewater.
8. 1.6.9  The  introduction  of  an  alkaline  solution  (e.g.,
sodium   hydroxide)   in   the   scrubber   can   assist   in
removing  compounds  from  the  gas  stream  if  the  use  of
water   alone   does   not   provide   adequate   removal
efficiencies. The use of additives in the scrubber can, in
itself, create safety and environmental concerns.
8. 1.6.10  Some  of  the  neutralized  absorbent  must  be
bled  off  from  the  recirculated  stream  to  prevent  the
brine  concentration  from  reaching  an  excessively  high
level,  but  water  consumption  and  the  volume  of  waste
can still be reduced by alkaline solution.
8. 1.6.11  Aqua  regia  is  a  reactive  mixture  of  nitric  and
hydrochloric   acids.   The   reaction   produces   nitrosyl
chloride and elemental chlorine:

chloride and chlorine.</li><li>1.6.15  Nitrogen  dioxide  may  also  be  produced  by
decomposition of nitric acid.</li><li>1.6.16  All   these   compounds   can   be   absorbed,   to

chemical nature or solubility.</li><li>1.6.18  The  dominant  factor  determining  particulate
collectability is particle size.</li><li>1.6.19  Abatement  of  particulate  compounds  requires
a  high-energy  method  (usually  creating  an  extremely
high  pressure-drop  across  the  abatement  device)  which

requirements.</li><li>1.7  Scrubber Design and Selection</li><li>1.7.1  A  variety  of  commercially  available  scrubbers
are applicable to absorption of readily soluble gases.</li><li>1.7.2  These  include  packed-bed  counter-current,  co-
current, and horizontal cross-flow  scrubbers,  horizontal
spray   chambers,   vertical   spray   towers,   and   gas-
atomizing scrubbers such as the venturi scrubber.</li><li>1.7.3  To some extent, the choice of scrubber type is a
matter  of  preference,  as  it  is  usually  possible  to  obtain
equivalent   performance   on   the   soluble   gases   with
different  types  of  devices;  however,  more  packing  or
higher liquid loading may be required on some devices.</li><li>1.8  The   choice   is   likely   to   be   limited   by   a
consideration  of  practical  or  economic  factors  such  as
cost,  available  space,  and  weight  (e.g.,  it  is  possible  to</li></ol><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 20017
reduce  the  size  of  the  scrubber,  usually  at  the  cost  of
increased energy consumption).
NOTE 5: See Appendix 1 for absorber design criteria.
8. 2  Group 2 — Acid Aerosols
8. 2.1  Part  of  acid  emissions  may  be  in  the  form  of
mists  (fine  droplets  or  aerosols)  rather  than  gases.
These may be composed of relatively non-volatile acids
such as phosphoric and sulfuric acids.
8. 2.1.1  The   mechanisms   of   removal   of   particulate
matter  (including  liquid  aerosols)  from  gas  streams  are
entirely different from those involved in the absorption
of gases (See Sections 13.1 through 13.3).
8. 2.1.2  The  critical  factor  in  the  collection  process  is
the  particle  size  of  the  mist.  If  the  mist  is  relatively
coarse,  as  apparently  is  the  case  in  most  instances,  the
same types of scrubbers that are used for gas absorption
should collect the mists with adequate efficiency.
8. 2.1.3  If   a   mist   having   a   particle   size   in   the
micrometer  or  sub-micrometer  range  is  encountered,  it
will  be  necessary  to  use  a  high-energy  scrubber  or  a
scrubber with a high-pressure-drop, sub-micron filter to
obtain adequate collection efficiency.
8. 2.1.4  Whenever  such  a  fine  mist  or  other  aerosol  is
encountered,  the  gas  stream  from  the  source  should  be
abated  at  point-of-use  or  separately  from  the  other
exhaust  gas  streams  in  the  plant  so  as  to  minimize
energy costs.
8. 2.1.5  Abatement  systems  utilizing  a  scrubber  with  a
high-pressure-drop,  sub-micron  filter  are  being  used  in
the  semiconductor  industry  to  reduce  emissions  from
aqua-regia  processes,  hot  nitric  baths  and  spray  etchers
using nitric acid (entrained in exhaust).
8. 2.2  It  has  been  determined  experimentally  that  the
collection  efficiency  of  a  scrubber  on  a  given  mist  or
dust  is  a  function  of  the  energy  consumed  in  the
exposure  of  the  particle  to  the  liquid  in  the  scrubbing
process.
8. 2.2.1  The  relationship  between  energy  consumption
and efficiency is little affected by the geometry or size
of the scrubber or by the method by which the energy is
applied  to  making  contact  between  the  gas  and  the
liquid (See Sections 13.1 through 13.3).
8. 2.2.2  The  energy  consumption  required  to  attain  a
given efficiency increases with a decrease in the size of
the aerosol (e.g., mist or dust).  In most of the scrubbers
used    in    the    semiconductor    industry,    the    energy
consumed  is  drawn  from  the  gas  stream  in  the  form  of
pressure drop.
8. 2.3  The   energy/efficiency   relationship   provides   a
convenient   and   practical   method   for   particle   and
aerosol scrubber design.  It is essentially independent of
the  size  of  the  scrubber,  at  least  down  to  a  very  small
size (perhaps 150 to 300 L/min (5–10 ft
3
/min) capacity,
and  possibly  even  smaller).    Hence,  a  small  pilot  unit
can  be  used  to  determine  performance  on  an  actual
plant exhaust stream.
8. 2.3.1  Tests   can   also   be   made   under   laboratory
conditions,  using  synthetic  aerosols  generated  for  the
purpose.
8. 2.3.2  The  major  problem  in  using  synthetic  aerosols
is  in  replicating  the  aerosols  actually  encountered  in
practice.
8. 2.3.3  The pilot plant scrubber should be tested over a
range of pressure drops to give a well-defined pressure
drop/efficiency correlation.
8. 3  Group 3 — Ammonia
8. 3.1  Ammonia  gas  (NH
3
)  can  be  either  a  process  gas
or  evolved  from  ammonium  hydroxide  used  in  wet
chemical  cleaning  of  wafers.    As  previously  discussed,
ammonia (NH
3
) exhausted through the acid system will
react  with  the  acids  present  producing  an  ammonium
salt aerosol that is not easily abated.
8. 3.1.1  Packed-bed  scrubbers  are  not  very  efficient  at
removing  sub-micron  ammonium  halide  aerosols,  even
though they are water-soluble.
8. 3.2  Wet  scrubber  technologies,  as  listed  above,  are
suitable  for  removal  of  ammonia  provided  they  are
operated and maintained at low pH (e.g., 3–5).
8. 3.2.1  This is normally achieved by the use of sulfuric
acid dosing.
8. 3.3  Processes that emit both ammonia and acid gases
(such  as  nitride  deposition)  should  be  fitted  with  a
point-of-use    ammonia    scrubber,    prior    to    being
exhausted to the acid exhaust.
8. 4  Group 4 — Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
8. 4.1  VOCs   can   represent   a   large   proportion   of
exhausted   air   streams   within   typical   semiconductor
operations.  The pollutants are produced from processes
such  as  solvent  cleaning,  and  photoresist  application
and   stripping.      Such   processes   typically   contribute
flammable,  hazardous,  and/or  environmentally  harmful
compounds  (e.g.,  VOCs,  which  participate  in  ozone
formation   in   the   atmosphere)   to   the   exhausted   air
stream.
8. 4.2  There  are  three  primary  abatement  technologies
used   at   end   of   pipe   for   this   category:   adsorption,
recovery  and  oxidation.    Adsorption  generally  uses
hydrophobic zeolite or activated carbon.  The oxidation
process usually is thermal or may be catalytic.</p><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 20018
8. 4.3  Emission Sources and Chemicals Emitted
8. 4.3.1  VOCs  usually  have  high  vapor  pressures  and
can  be  hazardous,  flammable,  or  may  tend  to  form
photochemical  smog.  Processes  using  them  (such  as
solvent     cleaning,     photoresist     application,     vapor
degreasing  and  photoresist  stripping)  are  carried  out
under local exhaust hoods or in exhausted enclosures.
8. 4.3.2  Chemicals  emitted  may  include:  acetone,  ethyl
benzene,  ethyl  lactate,  hexamethyldisilazane  (HMDS),
isopropyl   alcohol,   methanol,   methyl   ethyl   ketone
(MEK),     n-butyl     acetate,     n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP),     petroleum     distillates     (VM&amp;P     naphtha),
propylene  glycol  monomethyl  ether  acetate  (PGMEA)
and xylenes.
8. 4.3.3  The   chemical   species   emitted   are   typically
vapors  of  the  specific  VOCs  being  used.  These  vapors
are  entrained  in  large  volume  air  streams  and  are  thus
diluted to low levels.
8. 4.4  Current Practices
8. 4.4.1  New   regulations   and   proposed   legislation,
being    implemented    worldwide,    require    significant
reductions  in  total  VOC  emissions  (often  measured  in
terms of mass discharged).
8. 4.4.2  Removal of VOCs from exhaust streams can be
accomplished  by  adsorption,  (e.g.,  fluidized  bed  and
concentrator  systems),  oxidation,  or  a  combination  of
adsorption    and    oxidation    systems.        Adsorption
technologies,     with     subsequent     desorption     and
condensation, can be used to recover VOCs as a liquid.
8. 4.4.3  End-of-pipe abatement is most commonly used
for   VOCs.      Point-of-use   systems,   using   the   same
technologies   as   end-of-pipe,   are   employed   where
exhaust facilities preclude use of an end-of-pipe unit, or
as     additional     abatement     to     meet     regulatory
requirements.
NOTE 6: See  Appendix  1  for  VOC  abatement  design  and
selection criteria.
8. 5  Group 5 — Pyrophoric Gases
8. 5.1  Where  separate  exhausts  for  pyrophoric  gases
have been installed, it has been practice to fit a large air
dilution chamber at the end of pipe.  The reasoning has
been that this will ensure safety by dilution and result in
oxidation  of  any  residual  pyrophoric  gases.    However,
oxidation  may  not  occur  since  research  has  shown  that
silane,  once  diluted  to  &lt;1.5  %  in  nitrogen,  does  not
undergo   appreciable   oxidation   when   subsequently
mixed with air.
8. 5.2  Due    to    the    risks    associated    with    ducting
pyrophoric   gases   through   a   facility,   it   is   strongly
recommended  that  these  gases  be  abated  at  point-of-
use.  This avoids the need for a separate pyrophoric gas
exhaust.    If  POU  abatement  is  provided,  the  discharge
from the POU abatement system can be directed to the
acid or general exhaust system.
NOTE 7: See  Appendix  2  for  POU  abatement  of  pyrophoric
gases.
8. 6  Group 6  —  See  section  10  for  Emergency  Release
Discharge Exhaust provisions.
8. 7  Group-7 —  Special/Direct
8. 7.1  Recovery of specific gases such as hydrogen (H
2
)
may be necessary to reduce the massive risk of duct fire
when    large    quantities    of    flammable    gases    are
discharged.
8. 7.2       PFC     reclamation     maybe     required     by
environmental permits in some jurisdictions.
8. 7.3  Abatement  of  Oxides  of  Nitrogen  (NO
x
)  may  be
necessary  to  meet  environmental  regulations  in  some
jurisdictions.
8. 8  Group 8 —  General Exhaust
8. 8.1  This  exhaust  group  is  used  to  handle  exhaust
emissions that include heat and excessive nitrogen flow.
8. 8.2  Heat  exhaust  is  used  to  reduce  the  heat  load  on
the balance of the building.
8. 8.3  Exhaust  of  large  volumes  of  nitrogen  or  other
asphyxiant  gas  is  used  to  keep  potential  asphyxiation
hazards away from people.
8. 8.4  Discharge  from  general  exhaust  should  be  to  a
location where the heat or reduced oxygen will not be a
hazard to personnel.
8. 8.5  General   exhaust   can   sometimes   be   used   for
discharge   of   post-treatment   emissions   from   POU
abatement systems.
8. 8.5.1  In  such  a  case,  the  discharge  permit  for  the
POU  abatement  system  should  be  consulted  for  proper
management.
8. 9  Group 9 — Highly Toxic Gases
8. 9.1  Gases   such   as   arsine,   phosphine,   diborane,
germane,  etc.,  can  be  treated  in  a  variety  of  ways,
depending     upon     their     concentration     and     their
byproducts   (e.g.,   gas   reactor   columns,   adsorption
systems).
8. 9.2  These  gases  would  not  likely  be  allowed  in  a
burn  system  (even  though  many  of  them  might  be
pyrophoric)  because  they  could  release  hydrides  from
the air intake.</p><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 20019
8. 9.3  These    gases    may    be    prohibited,    in    some
jurisdictions,   from   being   discharged   with   no   other
treatment than dilution.
8. 9.4  Highly  toxic  gases  have  also  been  known  to
create problems in a thermal oxidation system, because
of  the  residue  they  leave  behind  and  the  periodic  need
for personnel to clean oxidation systems.
8. 9.5  Selectors of systems for discharge of highly toxic
gases    should    be    careful    to    meet    all    regulatory
requirements  and  should  be  conscious  of  the  discharge
location for the emission residue.
9  Point-of-Use (POU) Abatement Technologies
9. 1  The  selection  of  a  suitable  POU  abatement  device
is dependent on the process exhaust gases to be abated.
9. 2  To  determine  a  valid  abatement  method,  identify
the exhaust composition from the process as well as the
input   process   gases   in   order   to   select   a   suitable
abatement technology.
9. 3  The choice may also depend on other factors (e.g.,
whether removal of PFC gases is required or not).
9. 4  The  location  of  a  POU  abatement  system  in  the
process  exhaust  train  must  be  reviewed  for  pressure
drop,  condensation,  particles,  moisture  backstreaming,
etc.
9. 5  Many   types   of   POU   abatement   devices   are
available and they can broadly be divided into six types
of technologies listed below.</p><ol><li>Wet scrubbing systems,</li><li>Oxidation systems,</li><li>Cold bed systems (adsorbers/ chemisorbers),</li><li>Hot chemical bed systems,</li><li>Reactor systems (e.g., plasma, microwave),</li><li>Traps/filters/cyclones/precipitators,
NOTE 8: See Appendix 2 for explanations of each technology
type.</li><li>6  Units    may    employ    one    or    more    of    these
technologies, depending on the application.</li><li>7  Where     a     technology     using     an     exhaustible
cartridge/canister  is  employed,  consideration  must  be
given  to  adequate  means  of  detecting  bed  exhaustion
and to proper disposal techniques.
10  Provisions For Emergency Release</li><li>1  Routine  releases,  from  hazardous  gas  cylinders
and  sources  are  usually  minimal  (e.g.,  from  gas  line
purges).</li><li>2  Emergency   or   accidental   releases,   from   gas
cylinders in use, may be controlled through mechanical
systems  that  lower  the  frequency,  time  and  rate  of
releases.</li><li>3  Enclosing     gas     cylinders     and     non-welded
mechanical   fittings   in   exhausted   gas   cabinets   that
protect  the  systems  from  damage  can  minimize  the
frequency of accidental releases.</li><li>3.1    Proper  design  and  installation  of  gas  delivery
and  purge  systems  can  reduce  the  likelihood  of  severe
leaks.</li><li>4  The   duration   of   accidental   releases   can   be
lessened   by   activation   of   fail-closed   valves   or   gas
cylinder closure devices activated by monitoring and/or
alarm systems.</li><li>5  Equipping   gas   cylinders   with   restrictive   flow
orifices can lower the rate of accidental release.  SEMI
S5   -   Safety   Guideline   for   Flow   Limiting   Devices
provides   guidance   on   the   use   of   restrictive   flow
devices.</li><li>6  Exhaust of the gas cabinets should be designed to
contain   sudden   unanticipated   releases   of   gas   from
cylinders and piping.</li><li>6.1  These exhausts are typically used to manage gas
cabinets  and  other  very  high  volume  exhaust  flow
systems  that  will  only  occasionally  have  emissions
present.</li><li>6.2  Some  jurisdictions  do  not  allow  for  discharge
without treatment of emergency release discharges.</li><li>7  Each  system  selector  should  research  their  own
regulations  before  determining  the  proper  route  and
method    for    discharging    and    treating    emergency
releases.</li><li>8  Accidental releases from gas cylinders in use may
be  controlled  through  mechanical  systems  that  lower
the  concentration  exhausted  into  the  environment.    In
some   jurisdictions   there   are   requirements      (e.g.,
Uniform    Fire    Code,    Article    80)    to    lower    the
concentration  of  accidental  release,  in  exhaust  to  the
environment,  below  a  threshold  (such  as  one-half  (1/2)
of  Immediately  Dangerous  to  Life  and  Health  (IDLH)

end-of-pipe  abatement  systems  for  different  types  of
processes, materials, and exhaust systems.
12  Alternative Approaches
12. 1  This  guide  is  primarily  concerned  with  handling
gas  effluents  that  arise  from  semiconductor  processing.
Capture  and  abatement  is  not  the  only  approach  to
avoid release of hazardous materials.  If possible, use of
the  hazardous  materials  should  be  avoided.    In  theory
the following approach should be used:
12. 1.1  Replace  the  hazardous  material  with  one  that  is
non-hazardous or less hazardous.
12. 1.2  If  replacement  is  not  possible,  use  less  of  the
material.
12. 1.3  If  possible,  totally  enclose  the  system  so  all
material is recovered and reused.
12. 1.4  If   none   of   the   above   can   be   achieved,   fit
effective abatement devices.

A1-2  Principles
A1-2.1    Principles  of  gas  absorption  and  methods  of
design    of    gas    absorption    equipment    are    treated
extensively   in   chemical   engineering   literature   (See
Sections  A1-1.1–A1-1.8).  The  sources  cited  present
rigorous methods for design.
A1-2.2    Practical  design  of  scrubbers  is  at  least  semi-
empirical;  and  in  the  case  of  air  pollution  abatement
systems, design is often directly based on experimental
data.
A1-2.2.1    Consequently,  designs  should  be  based  on
mass-transfer  coefficients  that  have  been  determined
experimentally   under,   as   nearly   as   possible,   the
conditions of expected scrubber operation.
A1-2.2.2        It    should    be    noted    that    the    typical
concentrations  of  the  existing  empirical  data  base  is
several  orders  of  magnitude  greater  than  the  typical
concentrations  of  corrosives  exiting  a  semiconductor</p><p>12  McGraw-Hill, New York (1970), Danckwerts, P.V.

plant   (before   end-of-pipe   scrubbers),   therefore   the
efficiencies    in    these    data    bases    may    not    be
representative of low concentrations.
A1-2.2.3      Attempts   at   developing   the   empirical
database at these low concentrations suggest that actual
removal  efficiencies  are  lower  than  those  predicted  by
most scrubber design texts.
A1-2.2.4  As a result, new scrubbers may need to have
additional    packing    to    ensure    theoretical    removal
efficiencies are achieved.
A1-2.3    Rigorous  custom  design  of  a  scrubber  for  a
particular   service   requires   full   knowledge   of   the
conditions  that  are  to  be  encountered  as  well  as  of  the
performance that is to be attained.
A1-2.3.1    Gas  flow  rates  should  normally  be  known
fairly accurately — at least when the plant is originally
designed.
A1-2.3.2  Concentrations  of  acid  and  caustic  gases  will
need to be estimated.
A1-2.3.3  Conditions  to  be  met  may  be  changed  several
times over the probable life of the scrubbing equipment,
as  changes  are  made  in  the  semiconductor  fabrication
processes and the exhaust system.
A1-2.3.4    Exhaust  flow  may  also  be  increased,  to
accommodate   equipment   additions,   thus   raising   the
possibility the scrubber may become overloaded.
A1-2.4      Studies   by   SEMATECH   indicate   that   the
concentration  of  corrosives  in  the  exhaust  entering  the
end-of-pipe scrubber(s) range from &lt;1 ppmv to as high
as  10  ppmv.    Additionally,  the  typical  scrubber  with
99+%   theoretical   removal   efficiency   was   actually
achieving removal efficiencies ranging from 80%–95%.
A1-2.5  Scrubbers being applied to corrosive pollutants
are  usually  standardized  units  assembled  by  a  number
of  vendor  companies.    These  units  are  designed  to
handle   specified   ranges   of   gas   flow,   but   in   other
respects  are  not  designed  but  simply  built.    If  they  are
packed-bed   scrubbers,   they   are   usually   fitted   with
standard  depths  of  packing.    The  liquid  flow  rates  can
be varied within limits; but otherwise, the performance
potentials  are  fixed  unless  there  are  provisions  for
changing  the  depth  of  packing  and  perhaps  the  kind  of
packing.  Once the system is installed, such changes to
increase   the   efficiency   will   probably   increase   the</p><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 200113
pressure drop of the scrubber, which will require adding
to the fan capacity.
A1-2.6    To  ensure,  in  advance,  that  the  scrubber  will
have  adequate  removal  efficiency,  performance  tests
can  be  conducted.    Measurements  should  be  made  of
the contaminant concentrations in typical plant exhaust
gas streams, and the resulting data should be used to set
conservative     performance     requirements     for     the
scrubber.    Performance  tests  on  the  scrubber  should  be
conducted   prior   to   exposing   the   scrubber   to   the
semiconductor plant exhaust, preferably at the vendor’s
facility.    Performance  tests  should  identify  the  critical
operating variables and optimize the settings to achieve
optimal removal efficiencies at the lowest cost.
A1-2.6.1    Onsite  performance  tests  may  be  preferable,
when  qualifying  abatement  systems,  so  that  accurate
process conditions can be produced.  Permit exemptions
may   be   obtained   for   the   time-period   of   system
qualification.
A1-2.7      Design   and   construction   of   scrubbers   are
simplified by two factors: the exhaust gas streams are at
essentially  ambient  temperature,  and  they  carry  few
insoluble  solids.  The  low  temperature  allows  use  of
corrosion-resistant plastic construction.  The absence of
significant  solids  avoids  blockages  in  the  scrubbers,
which favors use of efficient gas-liquid contactors such
as packed beds.
A1-2.8  Two of the most favored scrubber types are the
counter-current  packed  tower  and  the  horizontal  cross-
flow  scrubber.    In  some  instances,  the  choice  between
these  devices  may  be  determined  by  plant  layout.    As
usually  constructed,  these  two  scrubber  types  have  low
to moderate gas pressure drops and are primarily suited
to  absorption  of  gases.    They  will  also  collect  the
coarser  mists  and  sprays  but  are  unsuited  to  collection
of fine mists and fumes having particle sizes under 2 to
3 micrometers.
A1-2.9    In  principle,  the  counter-current  tower  offers
the  highest  efficiency  with  the  least  consumption  of
absorbent   liquid.      However,   if   untreated   water   is
recirculated through the tower, as is commonly done in
semiconductor     plants,     the     advantages     of     the
countercurrent operation are lost.  On the other hand, if
the absorbed gas is reacted with an appropriate reagent
in  the  water,  essentially  the  same  performance  can  be
obtained  with  either  the  countercurrent  or  co-current
operation (see Section A1-1.7).  In co-current operation,
it  is  possible  to  use  higher  gas  velocities  to  obtain
higher  mass  transfer  rates  so  that  the  scrubber  can  be
made   smaller.      Gas   pressure   drops   will   also   be
increased, but this may be desirable if it is necessary to
collect a fine aerosol as well as absorb a gas.
A1-2.10    Horizontal  cross-flow  packed-bed  scrubbers
may  have  advantages  where  the  installation  imposes
restrictions  on  height  or  other  similar  layout  problems.
However,    in    other    respects,    they    do    not    offer
fundamental    advantages    over    the    packed    tower
scrubbers.
A1-2.11    Under  special  circumstances,  other  types  of
scrubbers may be appropriate for collection of aerosols.
High-energy scrubbers, of the venturi type, or scrubbers
with  high-pressure  drop,  sub-micron  filters  (e.g.,  fiber
bed)   are   appropriate   where   fine   aerosols   must   be
collected.      Wherever   possible,   measures   should   be
taken  to  avoid  formation  of  such  aerosols;  but  when
they  are  unavoidably  produced,  the  source  should  be
ventilated   through   a   separate   scrubbing   system   of
appropriate design.
A1-2.12      Packing   in   scrubbers   provides   a   large
interfacial area between the liquid and the gas, and also
induces   fluid   turbulence   to   promote   mass   transfer.
Packing  is  commonly  placed  in  scrubbers  in  a  random
manner.  Raschig and Pall rings as well as Berl saddles
were  common  early  packing  materials  used.    In  recent
years, numerous proprietary packing designs have been
introduced,  with  the  objective  of  providing  increased
mass-transfer   efficiency   with   reduced   gas   pressure
drop.  The  validity  of  claims  for  superior  performance
has  been  established  by  the  SEMATECH  experiments
in Section 13.1.
A1-2.13    Numerous  precautions  are  required  when
installing  and  operating  packed-bed  scrubbers.    It  is
essential to attain an even distribution of liquid over the
packing; channeling of liquid or gas flow results in loss
of  removal  efficiency.    Inadequate  liquid  distribution
can result in a reduction of the removal efficiency to as
little  as  one  seventh  of  theoretical  (See  Referenced
Document     A1-1.9).          The     predominant     liquid
distribution  system  employed  is  spray  nozzle  style.
This  style  is  inexpensive,  however,  it  is  difficult  to
maintain  and  tends  to  entrain  more  water  than  weir-
style.    Weir-style  liquid  distribution  systems  are  more
expensive.      However,   they   require   less   preventive
maintenance,  provide  equal  liquid  distribution  over  a
wide  range  of  flow  rates,  and  are  less  prone  to  liquid
carry-over.      Precautions   are   treated   at   length   in
previously cited literature.
A1-2.14  A critical aspect of any scrubber design is the
separation  of  entrainment.    Carry-over  of  spray  from  a
scrubber   can   produce   maintenance   issues   and   mist
emissions.    Failure  to  provide  adequate  entrainment
separation has been one of the most common problems
in   scrubber   installations.      The   predominant   mist
separator   employed   is   a   mesh   style.      Mesh   style
separators  are  effective  on  the  smaller  water  droplets
associated  with  spray  nozzles;  however,  maintenance</p><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 200114
due to solids and/or biological growth is required.  The
chevron  style  is  typically  used  in  conjunction  with  a
weir,  as  they  are  not  very  effective  on  the  smaller
droplet associated with spray nozzles; however they are
very immune to plugging from solids and/or biological
growth.    The  entrainment  separators  are  discussed  in
Sections A1-1.3 and A1-1.5.
A1-2.15    Chlorine,  fluorine  and  possibly  other  soluble
gases  can  be  entrained  in  scrubber  wastewater,  and
released  in  facilities  drains/vents.  Materials  such  as
fluorine  are  incompatible  with  many  plastics  and  can
damage   drains/   vents   resulting   in   leak,   odors,   and
facilities interruptions.
A1-3  VOC Abatement Equipment Design and
Selection
A1-3.1  Design Criteria for Adsorption Systems
A1-3.1.1    Adequate  contact  time  must  be  achieved
between   adsorption   media   and   VOC-laden   exhaust
stream.    The  adsorption  matrix  must  be  sized  so  that
adequate residence time within the media is maintained.
Also,   the   exhaust   stream   flow   must   be   distributed
uniformly over the adsorption matrix.
A1-3.1.2    Pressure  drop  across  the  adsorption  matrix
should be minimized to reduce energy consumption for
air handling equipment.
A1-3.1.3  Materials of construction must be resistant to
any  corrosive  action  by  the  VOC&#x27;s  or  by-products
formed    during    adsorption    or    adsorbent    matrix
regeneration.
A1-3.1.4  Hydrophobic zeolites and activated carbon in
fixed beds, fluid beds or rotating wheels are being used
for adsorption.
A1-3.1.5    Adsorption  materials  have  a  finite  capacity
for VOC adsorption and must be regenerated when their
capacity is exhausted.
A1-3.1.6    Monitoring  of  the  exhaust  stream  as  it  exits
the adsorption bed may be necessary to determine when
regeneration  or  replacement  of  the  adsorption  medium
is needed.
A1-3.1.7      Pretreatment   of   the   VOC-laden   exhaust
stream for removal of entrained particles or liquids may
be required to prevent plugging of the adsorption unit.
A1-3.1.8  Regeneration is accomplished by flushing the
adsorption bed with a carrier, typically steam, hot air or
hot nitrogen.
A1-3.1.8.1    Desorbed  VOC&#x27;s  must  be  recovered  or
destroyed.
A1-3.1.8.2      Current   practices   for   VOC   recovery
requires condensation or distillation.
A1-3.1.8.3    Current  practices  for  VOC  destruction  is
usually oxidation.
A1-3.2  Design Criteria for Oxidation Systems
A1-3.2.1  Adequate residence time, mixing with air and
temperature,   must   be   provided   for   high   efficiency
destruction of the VOC&#x27;s.
A1-3.2.2      Pretreatment   of   the   VOC-laden   exhaust
stream for removal of entrained particles or liquids may
be required to prevent plugging of the oxidation unit.
A1-3.2.3    Downstream  abatement  of  the  oxidation  unit
exhaust   will   be   required   if   corrosive   combustion
products   <!-- -->[such   as   hydrogen   chloride   (HCl)   from
chlorinated vapors]<!-- --> or particles <!-- -->[such as silicon dioxide
(SiO
2
)    from    hexamethyldisilazane    (HMDS)]<!-- -->    are
present.
A1-3.2.4      Concentrations   of   the   incoming   VOC&#x27;s
should be limited, especially when using a concentrator.
Typical   incoming   VOC   concentrations   should   not
exceed 25% of LEL.
A1-3.2.5    Energy  costs  for  heating  VOC-laden  exhaust
streams must be considered.  Straight thermal oxidizers
are   costly   to   use   with   high-volume,   low   VOC
concentration     exhaust     streams.          Therefore,     a
concentration   process   followed   by   recuperative   or
regenerative   oxidation   offers   a   more   cost-effective
solution.
A1-3.2.5.1    Catalytic  oxidation  may  also  offer  cost
savings;    however,    the    composition    of    incoming
compounds must not poison the catalyst.
A1-3.2.5.2    A  regenerative  thermal  oxidizer  (without  a
preceding   concentrator)   may   offer   cost   savings   in
certain applications.
A1-3.2.6    Hybrid  systems  (combinations  of  adsorption
and  oxidation  systems)  may  provide  a  cost-effective
approach  for  abating  dilute  concentrations  of  VOCs  in
exhaust  streams  by  combining  adsorption  beds  with
recuperative/regenerative   oxidation,   to   destroy   the
VOCs.
A1-3.2.6.1   All   design   considerations   for   adsorption
systems  and  oxidation  systems  are  relevent  for  any  of
the multitude of possible hybrid systems.
A1-3.2.6.2  Levels  of  oxidation  by-products  must  also
be considered such as oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon
monoxide (CO) and products of incomplete combustion
(PICs).
A1-3.2.7  Potential problem areas to be reviewed in any
equipment selection procedure:
A1-3.2.7.1    Halogenated  Materials  —  Additional  care
must  be  exercised  with  chlorinated  compounds,  which</p><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 200115
can   be   subject   to   stricter   regulatory   requirements.
Ensure that any oxidation unit does not create new and
more hazardous compounds, such as dioxins.
A1-3.2.7.2    Sulfur  and  Hexamethyldisilazane  (HMDS)
—  Both  have  the  potential  to  poison  many  catalysts,
and hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) will oxidize to form
silicon  dioxide,  which  can  result  in  particle  build  up  in
heat exchangers and oxidizers.
A1-3.2.7.3        Moisture    Levels    —    Moisture    can
significantly affect adsorption capability.</p><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 200116

A2-2  Wet Scrubbing Systems
A2-2.1  Water Scrubber
A2-2.1.1    Principle  of  Operation  —  Exhaust  gas  is
passed  through  an  enclosed  space  into  which  water  is
sprayed. The desired result is that gases will dissolve in
or  react  with  the  water.  A  large  contact  area  between
gas and water is required to maximize the dissolution or
reaction.  Numerous  designs  exist  to  achieve  this.    The
“packed-bed”  scrubber  is  filled  with  open  structure
objects  (e.g.,  hollow  balls)  that  are  fully  wetted  by  the
water  spray.  The  gas  passes  over  this  large  wet  surface
area.    If  the  water  spray  is  in  the  opposite  direction  to
the  gas  path  the  design  is  “counter  current”;  if  in  the
same  direction,  it  is  “co-current”;  and  if  at  90°  it  is
“cross  flow”.    Other  designs  to  maximize  gas/water
contact use meshes, atomized sprays, or multi chamber
systems that reverse the gas direction several times.
A2-2.1.2  Capacity  —  Total  gas  flow  is  determined  by
the size of the unit.
A2-2.1.3  Efficiency — Efficiency is determined by the
solubility  of  the  gas  in  water  and  retention  time  in  the
unit  as  well  as  the  given  mass  transfer  from  gas  to
liquid phase.  Acid gases are best removed; many other
process gases may not be removed.  If gas does dissolve
in  water  then  effectiveness  of  unit  will  be  determined
by    design    input    gas    flow    and    inlet    compound
concentrations.
A2-2.1.4    Limitations  —  Water  scrubbers  are  only
suitable  for  water-soluble  gases.  Many  process  gases
(e.g.,  silicon  compounds)  will  produce  insoluble  solids
(silica) on contact with water resulting in solids forming
that  may  block  the  water  sprays,  scrubber  packing  or
gas inlet port.
NOTE    1:    Compatibility    of    scrubber    drains    with    the
compounds  being  entrained  in  the  liquid  effluent  should  be
considered.
A2-2.2      Water   Scrubber   with   Energy   Input   (e.g.,
Venturi)
A2-1.2.1    Principle  of  Operation  —  Same  as  water
scrubber  but  gas  and  water  are  forced  to  mix  by  the
input  of  energy.  Most  commonly  this  is  done  by  a
venturi  through  which  the  gas  and  water  pass.  Other
designs   have   used   rapidly   rotating   blades   in   the
enclosed  scrubbing  space.  The  “active”  scrubbing  area
is  often  combined  with  a  passive  spray  chamber  or
packed bed.
A2-2.2.2        Capacity    —    Energy    enhanced    water
scrubbers have the same capacity as water scrubbers.
A2-2.2.3      Efficiency   —   Added   energy   improves
efficiency  over  water  scrubbers  due  to  forced  mixing,
which improves efficiency of particulate removal.
A2-2.2.4    Limitations  —  The  limitations  are  the  same
as for water scrubbers.
A2-2.3  Chemical Dosed Scrubber
A2-2.3.1    Principle  of  Operation  —  Chemical  Dosed
Scrubbers  operate  the  same  as  a  water  scrubber  but  a
chemical solution is added to the water.  This increases
the range of gases that can be removed, from those that
dissolve in water to those that will react with the chosen
chemical solution.  The chemical medium is selected to
react  with  the  known  input  gases  producing  water-
soluble    salts.        The    two    reaction    systems    most
commonly        employed        are        acid/base        and
reduction/oxidation  (redox).    Addition  of  solutions  of
sodium    hydroxide    (NaOH),    potassium    hydroxide
(KOH)  or  sulfuric  acid  are  frequently  used  to  enhance
effectiveness,  and  where  chemical  oxidation  is  needed
hypochlorites, periodates, or peroxides are introduced.
A2-2.3.2  Capacity — Same as water scrubber.
A2-2.3.3    Efficiency  —  Same  as  water  scrubber  but
increased  efficiency  by  using  chemical  dosing.    The
number  of  gases,  which  can  be  removed,  will  also
increase.
A2-2.3.4  Limitations — Even though a wider range of
gases  can  be  removed  with  this  chemical  dosing,  it  is
applicable  only  to  those  emissions  that  can  be  water
scrubbed.    The  potential  for  fouling  by  silica  solids</li></ol><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 200117
remains.      Potassium   hydroxide   (KOH)   or   (sodium
hydroxide  (NaOH)  solutions  have  to  be  increased  to
approximately  5%  to  ensure  dissolution  of  silicates.
Chemical  dosing  adds  another  hazardous  material  and
may result in liquid wastes that require treatment.
A2-2.4    Chemical  Dosed  Scrubber  with  Energy  Input
(e.g., Venturi)
A2-2.4.1    Principle  of  Operation  —  Same  as  Water
Scrubber with Energy Input (e.g., Venturi) above, with
the benefits of Chemical Dosed Scrubber.
A2-3  Oxidation Systems
A2-3.1  Burn Systems
A2-3.1.1 Principle  of  Operation  —  Burn  systems  are
designed    for    silane    abatement    by    utilizing    the
pyrophoric  properties  of  this  gas.    The  process  gas
containing   silane   is   injected   into   a   steel   container
through  which  a  stream  of  air  is  passing.    The  silane
auto-ignites  and  oxidizes  to  form  silica  powder,  which
deposits  in  the  system  or  is  carried  into  the  exhaust
duct.
A2-3.1.2    Capacity  —  Governed  by  the  build  up  of
powders,  small  units  may  need  cleaning  out  every  few
months, larger units will provide a year’s capacity.
A2-3.1.3 Efficiency — When burn systems are correctly
set up, nearly complete oxidation will occur, providing
that the input silane concentration is greater than 1.5%.
A2-3.1.4   Limitations  —  Burn  systems  are  suited  only
to silane (or other pyrophoric effluent) abatement.  Not
appropriate  for  mixed  gas  process.    If  silane  is  diluted
to   less   than   1.5%   in   nitrogen   before   input   no
measurable oxidation will occur and the silane will pass
directly to the exhaust.
A2-3.2  Flame Oxidation
A2-3.2.1      Principle   of   Operation   —   Oxidation   of
hydride  gases  by  combustion.    These  systems  use  a
chamber containing a fuel gas flame through which the
process   gas   is   passed.      The   resulting   oxides   from
combustion  pass  into  the  exhaust  and  may  be  abated
downstream.
A2-3.2.2  Flow Capacity — To calculate flow capacity,
combine  the  total  discharge  flows  that  constitute  input
to  the  abatement  device.  Include  pump  dilution  and
purge quantities. .
A2-3.2.3    Efficiency  —  For  simple  burner  designs,
efficiency can vary widely as gas flow changes; specific
units  have  been  designed  to  ensure  good  mixing  of
fuel/air  and  gas;  these  can  deliver  efficiencies  greater
than 99.9%.
A2-3.2.4  Limitations — Suited only to processes where
the  input  gases  can  be  safely  combusted.  Design  must
ensure  by-products  are  minimized  (e.g.,  chlorinated
compounds    like    phosgene/dioxins    and    oxides    of
nitrogen).  Produces  combustion  byproducts  of  process
gases, therefore, is often combined with a wet scrubber
to remove by-products or other water-soluble gases.
A2-3.3  Hot Chamber Oxidation
A2-3.3.1    Principle  of  Operation  —  Exhaust  gas  is
passed  into  an  electrically  heated  chamber  (typically
800°C)  where  it  is  mixed  with  air.  The  heated  mixture
oxidizes,  more  quickly  than  in  a  simple  burn  system,
but without a flame from fuel oxidation to assist.
A2-3.3.2  Flow Capacity — To calculate flow capacity,
combine  the  total  discharge  flows  that  constitute  input
to  the  abatement  device.  Include  pump  dilution  and
purge quantities.
A2-3.3.3  Efficiency  —  Hydride  gases  will  be  oxidized
and removed to below the OEL.
A2-3.3.4    Limitations  —  On  its  own,  hot  chamber
oxidation technology is suited only to hydrides or other
gases that will readily oxidize at the temperature of the
hot  chamber.    This  method  is  often  combined  with  a
wet  scrubber  to  remove  oxidized  by-products  or  other
water-soluble gases.
A2-3.4  Non-Flame Oxidation
A2-3.4.1  Principle of Operation — Non-flame systems
use   an   incandescent   porous   wall   for   combustion
without  a  flame.    Fuel  and  air  are  mixed  and  passed
through the matrix of the porous wall, which operates at
around 900° C. When process exhaust gases are passed
into this zone, they are oxidized.
A2-3.4.2  Flow Capacity — To calculate flow capacity,
combine  the  total  discharge  flows  that  constitute  input
to  the  abatement  device.  Include  pump  dilution  and
purge quantities.
A2-3.4.3    Efficiency  —  Hydride  gases  can  be  oxidized
by  a  method  similar  to  other  combustion  techniques.
High  efficiency  oxidation  is  needed  to  oxidize  more
stable fluorinated compounds.
A2-3.4.4 Limitations  —  Non-flame  oxidation  produces
oxidation  by-products,  and  therefore  must  often  be
combined  with  a  wet  scrubber  to  remove  particulate
matter or water-soluble gases.
A2-4  Cold Bed Systems (Adsorbers/
Chemisorbers)
A2-4.1  Adsorption
A2-4.1.1    Principle  of  Operation  —  Exhaust  gas  is
passed through a container (cylinder, canister, or drum)</p><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 200118
filled  with  adsorbent  granules.    These  are  commonly
based   on   activated   charcoal.         Some   gases   are
physically  adsorbed  into  the  granules  while  the  non-
adsorbed gases pass through into the facility exhaust.
A2-4.1.2    Flow  Capacity  and  Removal  Capacity —
Both  capacities  of  these  systems  are  a  function  of  the
container size (mass of granules) and surface area.
A2-4.1.3 Efficiency  —  For  a  single  gas,  efficiency  can
approach   100%   until   the   bed   capacity   is   reached.
However, since the gas is only held physically it can be
displaced  by  another  compound,  causing  the  efficiency
to drop significantly.
A2-4.1.4    Limitations  —  Adsorption  traps  hazardous
compounds  and  does  not  destroy  them.    Gases  are
adsorbed  at  different  rates  and  the  capacity  of  the  bed
for  different  gases  will  also  vary.  A  more  strongly
adsorbed  gas  entering  the  bed  after  a  less  strongly
adsorbed   compound   can   displace   the   first   gas   re-
releasing the first gas to the exhaust. The waste material
must  be  kept  sealed  in  the  container  and  evaluated  for
hazards.  Exposure to air, water, or heat can cause gases
adsorbed in the material to be released.
A2-4.2  Chemisorption
A2-4.2.1    Principle  of  Operation  —  Exhaust  gas  is
passed  through  a  container  of  granules  that  consist  of
either:
• adsorbent   granule   coated   with   some   reactive
chemical;
• reactive porous medium e.g., soda lime; or
• a resin matrix coated with some reactive chemical.
A2-4.2.1.1    Gases  are  adsorbed  into  the  porous  matrix
and   then   chemically   react   either   with   the   granules
themselves  or  with  the  coating.    These  reactions  are
designed   to   convert   the   gas   into   a   solid   material
(typically a salt) that remains attached to the granules.
A2-4.2.1.2    Reactive  chemicals  are  typically  either
bases     (metal     hydroxides)     or     oxidizers     (e.g.,
permanganates, or metal oxides).
A2-4.2.2    Flow  Capacity  and  Removal  Capacity —
Both  capacities  of  these  systems  are  a  function  of  the
container size (mass of granules) and surface area.
A2-4.2.3   Efficiency — Acid/Base and Redox reactions
are  most  readily  accomplished.    Therefore,  with  acidic
gases  and  hydride  gases,  efficiency  can  be  high;  with
removal  below  OEL.  With  other  gases,  e.g.,  PFCs  and
halogenated   carbon   compounds,   efficiency   is   often
minimal or none.
A2-4.2.4    Limitations  —  There  may  be  adsorption  as
well  as  chemisorption,  so  the  spent  material  must  be
evaluated  for  hazards,  since  gases  can  desorb  from  it.
This  is  especially  true  for  chlorine  (Cl
2
)  when  the  bed
uses hydroxides.  These will form OCl compounds that
on exposure to air or moisture will regenerate chlorine.
A2-4.2.4.1   Materials   used   for   chemisorption   can
themselves  be  hazardous  (e.g.,  heavy  metals  or  caustic
(KOH/NaOH))   therefore,   unused   canisters   may   be
classified as hazardous items.
A2-4.3  Adsorption with Subsequent Air Oxidation
A2-4.3.1  Principle of Operation — These systems are
designed  and  offered  mainly  for  high  flows  of  arsine
(AsH
3
)  and  phosphine  (PH
3
),  used  in  the  deposition  of
III-V   materials   (such   as   gallium   arsenide   (GaAs),
indium  phosphide  (InP)).    These  gases  are  adsorbed
into a carbon bed, into which air is subsequently fed at
a  controlled  rate  to  oxidize  the  adsorbed  hydride  into
oxides that will remain in the granules.
A2-4.3.2    Flow  Capacity  and  Removal  Capacity—
Both  capacities  of  these  systems  are  a  function  of  the
container  (drum)  size  (mass  of  granules)  and  surface
area.
A2-4.3.3    Efficiency  —  Capable  of  removing  hydrides
to below OEL.
A2-4.3.4    Limitations  —  Hydride  is  adsorbed  into  the
carbon  bed,  the  oxidation  of  this  is  exothermic.  When
air is fed in to oxidize the hydride, it is possible to start
combustion  of  the  carbon  bed,  unless  the  flow  rate  is
well controlled.
A2-5  Hot Chemical Bed Systems
A2-5.1  Hot Bed Reactors
A2-5.1.1    Principle  of  Operation  —  Exhaust  gases  are
passed through a steel container (cartridge/drum) that is
filled    with    reactive    material.        The    material    is
maintained at an elevated temperature, typically 250 to
550 degrees C.  The gases chemically react with the fill
material  and  are  converted  into  inorganic  salts  that
remain fused into the matrix of the fill material.  There
are  versions  with  a  single  fill  material  that  are  specific
to abatement of one gas, and versions with two or more
zones of fill material that can abate a wide range of gas
compounds.
A2-5.1.2    Flow  Capacity  and  Removal  Capacity —
Both capacities of hot bed systems are a function of the
cartridge size (mass of granules) and surface area.
A2-5.1.3    Efficiency  —  Efficiency  of  these  systems  is
generally  high,  with  gases  removed  to  below  OELs.
Stable PFC gases are not removed by all systems.</p><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 200119
A2-5.1.4    Limitations  —  Fill  material  can  also  react
with  oxygen  or  moisture  so  hot  bed  systems  are  not
always suited to wet processes or where air is used.
A2-5.2  Hot Catalytic Bed
A2-5.2.1  Principle of Operation  —  Gas  is  passed  into
a   steel   cartridge,   which   is   held   at   an   elevated
temperature,  that  contains  granules  of  a  catalyst.    The
target-input gas is catalytically converted to other gases
<!-- -->[e.g.,  ammonia  (NH
3
)  to  nitrogen  (N
2
)  and  hydrogen
(H
2
), and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) to nitrogen (N
2
) and
oxygen (O
2
)]<!-- -->.
A2-5.2.2      Removal   Capacity   —   In   theory,   if   not
poisoned,  a  catalyst  bed  should  last  for  a  long  time.
Units  available  are  claimed  to  be  able  to  operate  for
one-year before bed change.
A2-5.2.3    Efficiency  —  Efficiency  of  hot  catalytic  bed
systems is normally high, with removal of the target gas
to below OEL levels.
A2-5.2.4    Limitations  —  Hot  catalytic  bed  units  are
designed  to  be  gas  specific.    Catalysts  can  be  sensitive
to  other  compounds;  so  for  complex  gas  mixtures  in
process exhausts they may not be suitable on their own.
A2-5.3  Hot Reactor Beds with Gas Inputs
A2-5.3.1    Principle  of  Operation  —  Exhaust  gases  are
passed  into  a  hot  bed  as  in  hot  bed  reactors  above,  but
concurrently   with   the   process   gas   another   gas   is
introduced  (e.g.,  air  or  steam).    The  gases  then  react
together  in  the  bed,  either  with  each  other  or  with  the
bed  material.    Hazardous  gases  are  converted  either  to
solid  salts  that  remain  fused  into  the  bed  matrix,  or
other  gases  <!-- -->[e.g.,  carbon  dioxide  (CO
2
)]<!-- -->  that  pass  on
into the exhaust.
A2-5.3.2    Flow  Capacity  and  Removal  Capacity —
Both  capacities  of  these  systems  are  a  function  of  the
container (cartridge) size (mass of granules) and surface
area.
A2-5.3.3    Efficiency  —  Process  gases  <!-- -->[e.g.,  phosphine
(PH
3
), carbon monoxide (CO)]<!-- --> are normally removed to
below the OEL.
A2-5.3.4  Limitations — These systems are suited only
to  processes  where  the  end  products  will  be  either
stable solids or inert gases.
A2-6  Reactor Systems (Plasma, Microwave,
etc.)
A2-6.1    Principle  of  Operation  —   Gases  are  abated  in
the  vacuum  line  (before  or  after  the  vacuum  pump)  by
passing  them  through  a  reaction  chamber,  containing
plasma, to enhance reaction of gases such as silane into
a solid material.  For high efficiency PFC conversion, it
is necessary to inhibit recombination by the addition of
a   material   (e.g.,   moisture,   or   a   hydrogen/oxygen
mixture).    Two  types  of  reactors  exist  -  large  plasma
volume/small  surface  area,  in  which  a  downstream
particle  trap  is  utilized;  and  small  plasma  volume/large
surface  area,  where  solid  films  are  deposited.    Other
reactor  systems  (e.g.,  microwave  systems)  are  also
being developed.
A2-6.2      Flow Capacity   and   Removal   Capacity   —
Reactor  systems  are  designed  for  the  process  system
effluent and are sized to handle specific process flows.
A2-6.3  Efficiency — With inputs of up to 300 sccm of
silane,  removal  efficiencies  of  greater  than  99%  have
been  documented.    At  higher  flows  efficiency  can  be
reduced.    High  removal  efficiencies  of  PFCs  have  also
been demonstrated.
A2-6.4    Limitations  —  Silane  will  form  solids  in  the
plasma.      Gaseous   by-products   will   pass   into   the
exhaust.    Solids  transmission  into  the  vacuum  pump
will  be  reduced,  but  additional  abatement  devices  may
be  required  downstream  if  by-products  need  to  be
removed.  Formation of hydrogen (H
2
)  as  a  by-product
should   be   considered   to   ensure   that   the   H
2
outlet
concentration is below the lower flammable limit.
A2-7  Traps/Filters/Cyclones/Precipitators
A2-7.1  Principle of Operation —  Designed  to  remove
the particulate component in exhausts.  Some processes
produce solid powders (e.g., silica) and other processes
generate   condensable   vapors.      These   vapors,   on
compression  in  the  pump  and  cooling  in  the  exhaust,
condense  into  solid  materials.    Numerous  designs  exist
to  collect  these  solids  out  of  the  gas  stream.    These
include  filters  (paper/bag  etc.),  cooled  condensation
chambers, cyclones, and electrostatic precipitators.
A2-7.2    Removal  Capacity  —  Removal  capacity  is
normally  measured  as  the  mass  of  solid  the  unit  can
collect  before  it  partially  blocks.  As  they  are  blocked,
these   systems   generate   a   backpressure,   which   can
prevent   effective   removal   of   material   or   create   a
process disturbance.
A2-7.3    Efficiency—  Efficiency  for  these  various  units
is    difficult    to    measure.    It    is    usually    assessed
pragmatically  in  terms  of  increased  interval  between
exhaust clean out.
A2-7.4  Limitations— These various units must be used
with care and only when not associated with hazardous
gases.    Often  solid  exhaust  materials  are  mixed  with
hazardous  gases.    If  these  gases  are  present  in  the
trapped  solids  a  dangerous  situation  can  result.    Where
gases  and  solids  are  mixed  it  is  safer  to  keep  material
volatile  and  abate  all  by  a  POU  abatement  technology</p><p>SEMI F5-1101 © SEMI 1990, 200120
from  the  sections  above.    If  only  non-hazardous  gases
are   left   these   systems   can   provide   cost-effective
abatement to keep ducts clear.  They can also be used in
combination with other technologies.

4. 1    closed   secondary   containment    —    Secondary
containment   that   has   a   sealed   annulus.   In   closed
containment  systems,  the  annular  space  either  holds  a
certain pressure of gas or a certain level of vacuum. In
closed containment, a change in the pressure or vacuum
would  be  indicative  of  a  leak  in  either  the  primary  or
secondary system.</p><p>3 International Conference of Building Officials, 5360 South

4. 2  controlled work area — A spa ce within a building
where  HPM’s  may  be  stored,  handled,  dispensed,  or
used.
4. 3   equilibrium  vapor  concentrati on  (EVC)  —  The
state   of   a   material   at   which   vapor   pressure   has
stabilized  and  is  no  longer  rising  or  falling.  The  EVC
value  (in  parts  per  million)  of  a  material  is  determined
by  multiplying  the  vapor  pressure  by  10
6
and  dividing
by atmospheric pressure (760 mmHg at sea level).
4. 4  hazardous production materia l (HPM) — A solid,
liquid,  or  gas  that  has  a  degree-of-hazard  rating  in
health,  flammability,  or  reactivity  of  Class  3  or  4  as
ranked  by  NFPA  704  and  that  is  used  directly  in
research,  laboratory,  or  production  processes  that  have
as their end product materials that are not hazardous.
4. 5   highly  toxic  gas  —  A  chemical   that  has  a  median
lethal  concentration  (LC
50
)  in  air  of  200  parts  per
million   by   volume   or   less   of   gas   or   vapor,   or   2
milligrams per liter or less of mist, fume, or dust, when
administered  by  continuous  inhalation  for  one  hour  (or
less  if  death  occurs  within  one  hour)  to  albino  rats
weighing between 200 and 300 grams each.
4. 6   immediately  dangerous  to  life   and  health  (IDLH)
— A  concentration  of  airborne  contaminants,  normally
expressed  in  parts  per  million  or  milligrams  per  cubic
meter, which represents the maximum level from which
one  could  escape  within  thirty  minutes  without  any
escape-impairing    symptoms    or    irreversible    health
effects.   This   level   is   established   by   the   National
Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).
4. 7   level  of  concern  (LOC)  —  Equ al  to  0.1  of  the
IDLH value.
4. 8  lower detectable limit of instru ment (LDL) — The
lowest  concentration  of  a  substance  that  will  give  an
instrument  response  with  a  signal-to-noise  ratio  of  at
least 3 db.
4. 9   material  hazard  index  (MHI)  —  A   numeric  value
used for ranking chemical production materials in order
to   determine   the   level   of   controls   necessary   for
regulation.    MHI    is    determined    by    dividing    the
equilibrium vapor concentration (EVC) of a material at
25°C  by  the  level  of  concern  (LOC)  value  for  the
material.
4. 10    open   secondary   containment   —    Secondary
containment  with  an  open-ended  annular  space.  This
annulus must be directed to a system designed to handle
the contained HPM.
4. 11    permissible   exposure   limit   (PE L)    —    The
maximum  permitted  eight  hour  time-weighted  average
concentration    of    an    airborne    contaminant.    The
maximum  permitted  time-weighted  average  exposures
to be used are those published in 29 CFR 1910.1000.
4. 12    pressure   decay   method   —   The    method   of
detection   of   leakage   through   pressure   loss,   over   a
period of time, within a vessel or piping system.

air at or below a temperature of 54.5°C (130°F).
4. 15   secondary  containment  —  Lev el  of  containment
that    is    external    to    and    separate    from    primary
containment.  Secondary  containment  is  a  method  of
safeguarding  used  to  prevent  unauthorized  releases  of
toxic  or  hazardous  gases  into  uncontrolled  work  areas.
Secondary    containment    means    those    methods    or
facilities in addition to the primary containment system.

pressure),  over  a  period  of  time  within  a  vessel  or
piping system.
5  Containment Function
5. 1   Secondary  containment  should ,  in  case  of  release,
segregate  the  hazardous  production  material  (HPM)
from the surrounding area.
5. 2   Secondary  containment  system s  should  include
provisions to contain and detect substances which pose
health or property hazards and to direct such substances
into  areas  or  facilities  that  can  safely  treat,  dispose  of,
or dilute them prior to release into the atmosphere.
6  Containment Application
Secondary  containment  may  be  used  on  any  system  if
deemed appropriate by the authority responsible for the
system.  Secondary  containment  should  be  mandatory
for   all   HPM’s   that   are   included   in   the   following
categories:
6. 1    Those   substances   with   thresho ld   limit   values
(TLV)  below  the  lower  detectable  limit  (LDL)  of  the
detection systems in use.
6. 2  Those substances that provide  inadequate warning
properties.</p><p>SEMI F6-92 © SEMI 19923
6. 3    Those   substances   that   fall   into    the   following
categories:
6. 3.1  Any HPM’s which have a mat erial hazard index
(MHI) value equal to or greater than 500,000.
6. 3.2   Highly toxic gas.
6. 3.3  Pyrophorics.
6. 3.4   Substances  with  unknown,  but   potentially  high
toxicities (e.g., organometallics).
6. 3.5  Materials with an NFPA 704 r eactivity rating of
3 or 4.
6. 3.6   Any  corrosives  that  are  not  con tained  in  inert
process piping.
6. 4   Where  piping  containing  HPM ’s  is  installed  in  a
manner to conceal it from view.
6. 5   Where  piping  containing  HPM ’s  is  installed  in
uncontrolled or unventilated areas such as drop ceilings
or behind walls.
6. 6   Where  required  by  UBC  H-6  o r  other  existing
codes.
6. 7  Where there is any reasonable  possibility of a leak
in  the  primary  containment  due  to  normal  wear  and
tear, possible abuse, or corrosive attack to the piping on
the inside or exterior.
7  Containment Methods
The  method  of  containment  may  take  many  forms
provided   that   the   method   is   sound   in   engineering
design.   This   design   should   be   in   conformance   to
nationally recognized codes and standards as well as to
the requirements of local safety jurisdictions.
8  Materials of Construction
8. 1  Chemical Compatibility — If t here is a possibility
that  the  HPM,  or  its  reaction  products,  is  corrosive,  to
any  extent,  to  the  secondary  containment,  one  should
develop   a   procedure   to   verify   the   integrity   of   the
containment  system.  This  verification  procedure  need
only  be  performed  in  the  event  that  the  HPM,  or  its
reaction products, contacts the containment (see Section
9).
8. 2    Fire   Resistance   —   If   walls   are    used   as   the
secondary    containment    system,    they    should    be
constructed of materials resistant of fire. The fire rating
of the secondary containment should be as follows:
8. 2.1  Two hour rating for pyrophori cs;
8. 2.2  One hour rating for all others.
9  Design Requirements
9. 1    Design   Pressure   —   The   system    should   be
designed  to  provide  secondary  containment  with  the
ability to withstand the pressure of the entire volume of
the potential leaking source without leakage.
9. 1.1   Closed  secondary  containment   systems  should
have   sufficient   design   pressure   to   withstand   the
pressure  of  the  entire  contents  of  the  source  of  the
HPM. The design safety factor must be consistent with
ANSI B31.3.
9. 1.2   Open  secondary  containment  s ystems  should
have  sufficient  design  pressure  to  withstand  the  release
at  full  tank  pressure  or  the  entire  contents  of  the  HPM
released within a time of two minutes.
9. 1.3   Special  consideration  should  b e  given  to  the
containment   of   pyrophorics.   Some   pyrophorics   can
develop     considerable     explosive     pressure.     The
elimination    of    oxygen    from    the    annulus    of    a
containment  system  should  be  considered  in  lieu  of
explosive pressure data.
9. 2   Resistance  to  External  Forces  —  The  method  of
construction  of  secondary  containment  systems  should
be sufficient to withstand:
9. 2.1   Normal  physical  abuse  found  i n  the  industrial
workplace.
9. 2.2   Seismic  zone  activity  as  shown   in  the  UBC
(Uniform Building Code) or other applicable codes.
9. 3   Leak  Integrity  —  The  system  s hould  be  designed
to  provide  secondary  containment  with  sufficient  leak
integrity  to  prevent  exceeding  the  PEL  of  the  HPM  in
uncontrolled work areas.
9. 3.1    Primary   piping   should   be   leak    tested   in
accordance with SEMI F1.
9. 3.2   Closed  secondary  containment   systems  should
have the same leak integrity as the primary containment
except   the   closed   secondary   containment   systems
should be leak tested with the annulus pressurized to 2
times   the   maximum   operating   pressure   with   argon
containing  at  least  10%  helium.  There  should  be  no
drop in pressure for a period of 12 hours.
9. 3.3   Open  secondary  containment  s ystems  should  be
leak  tested  to  the  same  criteria  as  closed  secondary
containment systems per 9.3.2 above.
10  Separation of HPM’s
A single secondary containment may be used to contain
more than one HPM provided that those HPM’s are not
reactive    with    any    other    HPM    in    the    common
containment.  Documents  that  should  be  considered  for
proper separation of HPM’s include:</p><p>SEMI F6-92 © SEMI 19924
10. 1      SEMI     S4,     Safety     Guideline     for      the
Segregation/Separation  of  Gas  Cylinders  Contained  in
Cabinets
10. 2  Materials Safety Data Sheets
10. 3    NFPA   Fire   Protection   Guide   o n   Hazardous
Materials
11  Cross Connections
There  should  be  no  mechanical  cross  connection  of
secondary  containment  systems  with  other  systems  not
designed  specifically  for  the  secondary  containment  of
the particular HPM’s.
12  Monitoring
The  annulus  should  be  monitored  for  leakage  of  the
primary system in accordance with the following:
12. 1  The sensitivity of the detection  system should be
sufficient  to  detect  leakage  at  1/2  Threshold  Limit
Values (TLV’s) at the discharge to treatment of an open
secondary containment system.
12. 2   Detection  of  leakage  into  the  a nnulus  of  the
secondary  containment  system  should  include  alarm
systems.
12. 3  Detection methods may includ e:
12. 3.1   Direct  detection  of  the  HPM  o r  its  reaction
products (open secondary containment system).
12. 3.2    Pressure   decay   method   (closed    secondary
containment system).
12. 3.3    Vacuum   decay   method   (closed    secondary
containment system).
13  Leak Management
The  secondary  containment  system  should  be  designed
to   control   and   direct   leaking   materials.   Control   of
HPM’s     may     consist     of     dilution,     absorption,
incineration,   scrubbing,   venting,   or   those   methods
deemed  safe  and  suitable  to  the  governing  authorities
responsible   for   the   facility.   The   initiation   of   the
secondary    containment    alarm    system    should    be
automated.  This  system  should  automatically  institute
the  management  of  the  leaking  HPM  in  the  event  of  a
breach of the primary system.
14  Periodic Testing - After In stallation
14. 1   Secondarily  contained  piping  s ystems  must  be
inspectable.  The  method  of  inspection  must  be  able  to
reveal  the  current  strength  and  leak  integrity  of  the
primary and secondary containment systems.
14. 2   The  secondary  containment  m ust  be  periodically
leak  tested  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  set  forth  in
Section  9.3  of  the  above.  Structural  testing  of  both  the
process  piping  and  the  secondary  containment  should
be  conducted  to  the  maximum  pressure  specified  in
Section 9.1 of the above.
14. 3   Any  secondarily  contained  pip ing  system  failing
the  periodic  inspection  should  be  repaired  or  replaced
immediately.

4.   Summary of Method
4. 1 Subject    tube    fitting    connections    made    of
fluorocarbon materials to extreme tensile forces.
5.   Significance   and   Use
5. 1 In the manufacturing of semiconductor products,
many  types  of  hazardous  chemicals  and  solvents  are
required.   As   a   result,   tubing   and   various   fitting
designs    of    fluorocarbon    materials    (which    are
chemically   resistant   to   these   fluids)   are   used   to
transport  those  fluids.  It  is  important  to  control  the
testing   process   when   evaluating   various   fitting
designs,  so  that  accurate  comparisons  of  the  tensile
strength can be made.
5. 2 It  is  the  intent  of  this  method  to  provide  a
procedure in which the tensile force will be applied to
tube    fitting    connections    made    of    fluorocarbon
materials.     By     using     this     method,     accurate
comparisons  of  various  tube  fitting  designs  can  be
achieved.
5. 3 The results obtained when using this method are
applicable    only    to    conditions    that    specifically
duplicate the procedures used within this method.
5. 4 When  using  this  test  method,  it  is  assumed  that
the  test  specimens  are  truly  representative  of  the
material and manufacturing process specified for that
product.   Departure   from   this   assumption   could
introduce  discrepancies  that  are  greater  than  those
introduced   by   departure   from   the   details   of   the
procedure outlined in this method.

no  less  than  10  cm  (4  in)  between  the  tensile  fixture
and the tube end of the fitting connection.
9. 3 Specimen   Surface    All   surfaces   of   the
specimens shall be free of visible flaws, scratches, or
other   imperfections,   unless   typically   found   on   a
representative sample of the product.
9. 4 Specimen  Conditioning   All  specimens  must
be  conditioned  for  a  minimum  of  one  hour  in  an  air
environment  of  23°  ±  2.8°C  (73°  ±  5°F)  prior  to
being subjected to tensile forces.

11. 1 Assemble    a    test    fitting    connection,    per
manufacturer&#x27;s  specification,  to  one  end  of  the  tube.
(See 9.2.)
11. 2 Install   the   fitting   connection   to   the   tensile
fixture  (see  Figure  1)  in  a  manner  that  prevents
distortion of the connection.
11. 3 Secure  the  open  end  of  the  tube  to  the  tensile
fixture,  leaving  a  minimum  of  10  cm  (4  in)  of

4  Summary of Method
4. 1     Subject    tube    fitting    connection s    made    of
fluorocarbon  materials  to  extreme  tensile  forces,  while
maintaining a specified pressure to the internal cavity of
the fitting and tube.
5  Significance and Use
5. 1   In  the  manufacturing  of  semic onductor  products,
many  types  of  hazardous  chemicals  and  solvents  are
required. As a result, tubing and various fitting designs
made  of  fluorocarbon  materials  (which  are  chemically
resistant  to  these  fluids)  are  used  to  transport  those
fluids.  It  is  important  to  control  the  testing  process
when evaluating various fitting designs, so that accurate
comparisons  of  the  sealing  capabilities  of  tube  fitting
connections can be made.
5. 2    It   is   the   intent   of   this   method   t o   provide   a
procedure  in  which  the  air  pressure  and  tensile  force
will  be  applied  to  tube  fitting  connections  made  of
fluorocarbon  materials.  By  using  this  method,  accurate
comparisons  of  various  tube  fitting  designs  can  be
achieved.
5. 3   The  results  obtained  when  usin g  this  method  are
applicable  only  to  conditions  that  specifically  duplicate
the procedures used within this method.
5. 4  When using this test method, i t is assumed that the
test  specimens  are  truly  representative  of  the  material
and  manufacturing  process  specified  for  that  product.
Departure    from    this    assumption    could    introduce
discrepancies  that  are  greater  than  those  introduced  by
departure  from  the  details  of  the  procedure  outlined  in
this method.

failure by continuously increasing the internal hydraulic
pressure. New tubing and fitting samples are required at
each  specific  elevated  fluid  temperature  condition,  and
failures are to occur within 60 to 70 seconds from initial
exposure to the high pressure fluid.
5  Significance and Use
5. 1   In  the  manufacturing  of  semic onductor  products,
many  types  of  hazardous  chemicals  and  solvents  are
required. As a result, tubing and various fitting designs
made  of  fluorocarbon  materials  (which  are  chemically
resistant  to  these  fluids)  are  used  to  transport  those
fluids.  It  is  important  to  control  the  testing  process
when evaluating various fitting designs, so that accurate
comparisons of the pressure limits can be made.
5. 2    It   is   the   intent   of   this   method   t o   provide   a
procedure to determine the maximum pressure limits of
tube    fitting    connections    made    of    fluorocarbon
materials.  By  using  this  method,  accurate  comparisons
of various tube fitting designs can be achieved.
5. 3   The  results  obtained  when  usin g  this  method  are
applicable  only  to  conditions  that  specifically  duplicate
the procedures used within this method.
5. 4  When using this test method, i t is assumed that the
test  specimens  are  truly  representative  of  the  material
and  manufacturing  process  specified  for  that  product.
Departure    from    this    assumption    could    introduce
discrepancies  that  are  greater  than  those  introduced  by
departure  from  the  details  of  the  procedure  outlined  in
this method.
6  Terminology
6. 1  characterize — To describe th e quality of.
6. 2   failure  —  Any  external  leakag e  of  fluid  through
the  tube  wall  or  the  tube  fitting  connection,  whether  it
be catastrophic or a slow leak.
6. 3  free end closure — A metal tu be fitting connection
which  is  securely  fastened  to  the  tube  and  does  not
contribute to the restraint of the test specimen.
6. 4   isolation  valve  —  A  valve  use d  to  separate  the
high temperature fluid from the high pressure fluid or to
separate the samples from each other.
NOTE: This definition is used in only this test method.</p><p>SEMI F10-0698 © SEMI 1993, 19982
6. 5  pressure containing envelope —  The internal area
of a specimen which contains the fluid media.
6. 6   standard  deviation  —  A  meas ure  of  the  variation
among the members of a statistical sample.
6. 7  subject — To expose to.
7  Description of Test Equip ment
7. 1  This test method requires the u se of two hydraulic
systems.
7. 1.1   A  high  pressure  system  capabl e  of  applying  a
continuous increase of the internal hydraulic pressure to
the test specimen.
7. 1.2   A  low  pressure,  high  temperat ure  circulation
system capable of controlling a fluid temperature within
± 3°C (± 5°F) of a specified test temperature.
7. 1.2.1   The  pressure  is  to  be  75  kPa  (1 1  psig)  or  less
for  all  temperatures,  within  the  range  of  25°  to  200°C
(77° to 392°F).
7. 2   Test  Fluid  —  When  testing  at   or  below  82°C
(180°F),  an  SAE  20  weight  hydraulic  oil  may  be  used.
When  testing  at  elevated  fluid  temperatures,  use  a
synthetic oil that is acceptable for elevated temperatures
of  up  to  200°C  (392°F)  and  compatible  with  the  test
stand and test specimens.
7. 3   An  instrument  to  record  the  pe ak  pressure  within
1% of full scale.
7. 4   An  instrument  to  monitor  temp erature  within  ±
1°C (± 2°F).
7. 5  Specimen Support — Any sup port is acceptable as
long  as  it  does  not  contribute  to  the  restraint  of  the
specimen in either the circumferential or axial direction.
7. 6  An enclosure that will allow o bservation of the test
specimen  and  that  is  also  capable  of  controlling  the
ambient temperature to 31° ± 6°C (88° ± 11°F).

8  Safety Precautions
WARNING:  This  test  method  will  subject  test
specimens   to   conditions   that   exceed   the
normal   performance   rating   of   the   product
under  evaluation.  Adequate  precautions  must
be   taken   to   prevent   injury   to   the   person
conducting the test, as catastrophic failures of
the test specimens are expected. The hydraulic
plumbing   and   safety   enclosure   is   to   be
constructed  of  materials  which  are  capable  of
containing a fluid at 200°C (392°F).
9  Test Specimens and Cond itioning
9. 1   Sample  Size  —  A  minimum  of   three  specimens
shall be tested at each temperature condition.
9. 1.1    The   three   connections   will   be    conditioned
simultaneously.  See  Figure  1  for  a  basic  pressure  and
circulation system.
9. 2  Specimen Surface — All surfa ces of the specimens
shall   be   free   of   visible   flaws,   scratches,   or   other
imperfections,      unless      typically      found      on      a
representative sample of the product.
9. 3   Specimen  Conditioning  —  All   specimens  must  be
conditioned  for  a  minimum  of  one  hour  in  an  air
environment  of  23°  ±  2.8°C  (73°  ±  5°F)  prior  to  being
subjected to pressure.
9. 4   A  fluid  at  the  specified  temper ature  must  be
circulated through all the test specimens for a minimum
of one-half hour.</p><p>SEMI F10-0698 © SEMI 1993, 19983
10  Test Procedure
10. 1   Install  three  fitting  connection s,  assembled  per
manufacturer’s specifications, to the test system. Allow
for a minimum of 30 cm (12 in.) of tube length between
the test fitting connection and the free end closure.
10. 2   The  plumbing  must  permit  free   movement  of
each test specimen to allow for distortion.
10. 3   Using  the  low  pressure  circula tion  system  (see
Section  7.1.2),  condition  the  test  specimens  to  25°C
(77°F) per 9.4. The system pressure is not to exceed 75
kPa (11 psig) during conditioning.
10. 4   Properly  position  the  isolation   valves  in  such  a
way  that  only  one  specimen  will  be  pressure  tested,
while the remaining specimens continue to have heated
fluid circulating through them.
WARNING:  Take  all  necessary  precautions  when
positioning  the  isolation  valves,  due  to  the  potential
harm   which   might   be   caused   by   an   accidental
exposure to the high temperature fluid.
10. 4.1   Test  each  specimen  within  two    minutes  after
isolating it from the hot oil circulation system.
10. 5   Using  the  high  pressure  system   (see  Section
7. 1.1), pressurize the specimen until failure occurs.
10. 5.1  Increase the pressure at a unifo rm and constant
rate  such  that  failure  occurs  between  60  to  70  seconds
from initial exposure to the high pressure fluid.
10. 6   Record  on  test  data  sheet  (see   Appendix  1  for
sample  test  data  sheet)  the  pressure  and  temperature  at
which the failure occurred. To identify mode of failure,
record pressure reading under column:
“T” — for tube failure.
“F” — for fitting connection failure.
10. 7   Repeat  10.1  through  10.5,  subs tituting,  for  the
fluid  temperature  in  Section  10.2,  the  remaining  six
temperatures:  75°C  (167°F),  100°C  (212°F),  125°C
(257°F),  150°C  (302°F),  175°C  (347°F),  and  200°C
(392°F).
11  Calculations
11. 1    Calculate   the   average   pressure    for   each   test
temperature and record in kPa (psig).
11. 2   Calculate  the  standard  deviatio n  for  each  test
temperature and record.
12  Data Accuracy
12. 1  Pressure — kPa: ± 2%
12. 2  Fluid Temperature — ± 1°C (±  2°F)

Basic Test System
7  Safety Precautions
WARNING: This test method will subject test
specimens to conditions that may exceed the
normal performance ratings of the products
under evaluation. Adequate precautions must
be taken to prevent injury to the person
conducting the test. The hydraulic plumbing
and safety enclosure are to be constructed of
materials which are capable of containing a
fluid at 200°C (392°F).
8  Test Specimens and Conditioning
8. 1  Sample  Size  —  A  minimum  of  three  specimens
shall be tested at each pressure condition.
8. 2  Specimen Surface — All surfaces of the specimens
shall   be   free   of   visible   flaws,   scratches,   or   other
imperfections,      unless      typically      found      on      a
representative sample of the product.
8. 3  Specimen  Conditioning  —  All  specimens  must  be
conditioned  for  a  minimum  of  one  hour  in  an  air
environment  of  23°  ±  2.8°C  (73°  ±  5°F)  prior  to  being
subjected to pressure.
9  Test Procedure
9. 1      Install   three   fitting   connections,   assembled   per
manufacturer’s   specifications,   to   the   test   manifold.
Allow  for  a  minimum  of  30  cm  (12  in)  of  tube  length
between the test fitting connection and free end closure.
(See Figure 1.)
9. 1.1  The apparatus should include a section of flexible
line  from  the  free  end  enclosure  to  return  manifold  to
allow for expansion.
9. 2      Circulate   25°C   (77°F)   fluid   through   the   test
samples  with  a  constant  pressure  of  100  kPa  (15  psig)
for one hour.
9. 2.1    When  three  failures  occur  at  any  given  pressure
during  the  initial  room  temperature  condition  (prior  to
the  specimens  having  been  subjected  to  any  elevated
temperature conditions), testing is terminated.
9. 3  Increase  the  fluid  temperature  to  75°C  (167°F)  for
a total time of two hours from the time the temperature
was  initially  increased.  The  maximum  time  allowed  to
achieve  the  elevated  temperature  is  one  hour.  (See
Figure 2.)</p><p>SEMI F11-0998 © SEMI 1993, 1998 3</p><p>Figure 2
Thermal Transition Chart
9. 4    Lower  the  fluid  temperature  to  25°C  (77°F)  for  a
total  of  two  hours.  The  maximum  time  allowed  to
achieve  the  25°C  (77°F)  temperature  condition  is  one
hour.
9. 5    Repeat  Sections  9.3  and  9.4,  substituting,  for  the
fluid  temperature  in  Section  9.3,  the  remaining  five
temperatures:  100°C  (212°F),  125°C  (257°F),  150°C
(302°F), 175°C (347°F), and 200°C (392°F).
9. 5.1    The  test  samples  should  be  at  25°C  (77°F)  prior
to stopping the test at the end of a work shift.
9. 5.1.1    The  two  hours  at  25°C  (77°F)  will  be  equally
divided  between  the  present  day  cool-down  time  and
the next day start-up time.
9. 6    Monitor  each  of  the  three  connections  for  external
leakage throughout all test parameters.
9. 7    Any  external  leakage  at  a  tube  connection  will  be
recorded as a failure on the test data sheet (see Related
Information 1 for sample test data sheet).
9. 7.1  Leakage  observed,  once  an  elevated  temperature
is   reached,   will   be   recorded   as   a   failure   at   that
temperature.
9. 7.2  Leakage at or during the cool-down cycle is to be
recorded  as  a  failure  of  the  previously  tested  elevated
temperature condition.
9. 7.3  Leakage observed     while     increasing     the
temperature to the next condition is to be recorded as a
failure of the previous elevated temperature condition.
9. 8    Once  a  connection  shows  leakage  and  its  failure
pressure   and   temperature   has   been   recorded,   any
additional leakage is not taken into consideration.
9. 8.1    If  leakage  is  not  excessive,  the  connection  can
remain  in  the  system  until  testing  at  that  pressure  has
been completed.
9. 8.2  If leakage of a connection becomes excessive, the
connection  may  be  retightened  or  replaced  in  order  to
continue   testing   of   the   remaining   specimens.   Take
precautions not to disturb the remaining test specimens.
WARNING:  Due  to  the  extreme  danger  of  high
temperature  fluids,  take  all  necessary  precautions
when   retightening   or   replacing   a   connection,   to
prevent accidental exposure to the heated fluid.
9. 9  After three connection failures are recorded, or the
200°C  (392°F)  temperature  has  been  achieved,  a  new
set  of  fittings  is  to  be  installed  for  the  next  pressure
condition.
9. 10  Repeat Sections 9.2 through 9.9 for the remaining
six pressures: 200 kPa (29 psig), 400 kPa (58 psig), 600
kPa (87 psig), 800 kPa (116 psig), 1000 kPa (145 psig),
and 1200 kPa (174 psig).
