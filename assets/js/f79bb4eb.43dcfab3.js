Examples  of  performance  characteristics  are  response  time,  accuracy,\nreliability, drydown, and cleanliness.\n9. 2  Scope \u2014  These  guidelines  are  limited  to  macro  sealing  and  macro  to  micro  sealing.    It  specifically  excludes\nwafer-scale testing.  They address interconnection (fluidic, electrical, and other) of the microfluidic subsystem to the\nexternal system.  They also address interconnection of individual components within the microfluidic subsystem.\n9. 3  Assembly and Test Preparation\n9. 3.1  Visually  inspect  parts  under  microscope  before  assembly.    Perform  any  testing  possible  at  the  MEMS\ncomponent level as characterization or to determine failures before integrating.\n9. 3.2  Assemble under hoods or in cleanroom.  Wear gloves.  Use electrostatic protection.  Assembly should be in\nthe same class environment as required by user.  See SEMI E129.\n9. 3.3  Follow  manufacturer\u2019s  instructions  for  tightening  fittings  and  seals  and  connecting  parts.    If  applicable,\nmeasure torque or other assembly parameters.  Subsystem should have means or method to hold part being tightened\nto not compromise the structural integrity of the part.\n9. 3.4  Seals  used  to  connect  components  should  be  considered  for  thermal  performance,  cleanliness,  and  material\ncompatibility.  See \xb69.4.?.\n9. 3.5  Test systems should have filters installed upstream of the device under test.  Select pore size similar to pore\nsize used in final application.\n9. 4  Verification and Validation\n9. 4.1  The following are guidelines for verification and validation.  Some may also apply to production testing.\n9. 4.2  Test  for  particles  and  for  other  contamination  characteristics  such  as  moisture  dry  down  as  required  by  end\nuser as a system.  See ASTM F1394 (particle), SEMI E66 (particle), ASTM F1397 (moisture).\n9. 4.3  Test  for  applicable  performance  parameters  such  as  accuracy  using  NIST  traceable  standards.    Time  or\nprocess  response  characterizations  should  model  system  and  connection  volumes,  based  on  specification  designed\nfor.  If the final application can not be duplicated, consider final system in the data analysis.  For faster process time\nminimize volume and surface area between the flow control system and chamber.  Test in gas or liquid that it will be\nused with or list substitute/test gas or liquid on test report.\n9. 4.4  Cycle parts in environment that they will be used in or in an accelerated mode. This is to model mean time to\nfailure or other parameters of reliability.
