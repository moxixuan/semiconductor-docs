Values of thesevariables will be available to the host through collection event reports and host status queries.6.2 Requirements6.2.1 All generic variable items defined in SEMI E30 are required by all TSEM equipment.6.2.2 Any supplier-defined variables shall be documented in the same format used by this document. The followingminimum information is required: Class: Format: Description: 6.3 Data Types6.3.1 Equipment Constants (ECVs) can be changed by the host using S2,F15. The operator may be able to changesome values, but the equipment does not change the values on its own. The value of an equipment constant may bequeried by the host at any time, using the S2,F13/14 transaction. They reside in non-volatile memory of theequipment. Equipment constants remain in effect until they are overwritten either by manual entry or by a S2,F15(NEW EQUIPMENT CONSTANT SEND).6.3.2 Equipment constants have various uses in TSEM, including the following: Equipment offsets that match the performance of several pieces of equipment that would otherwise performdifferently due to inherent manufacturing differences. Examples are home values and motion axis scalingfactors."),(0,s.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 2 --",">"),(0,s.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E122.1-0703 \xa9 SEMI 20037  Setting the configuration of the equipment to allow for different material specifications, equipment options,material flows, frequency of automatic functions, etc. An example is yield check frequency. Managing optional machine features. Examples are constants that indicate whether optional features such asautomated media stackers are present and control the configuration and function of these optional subsystemswhen they are present.6.3.3 Status Variables (SVs) are valid at all times. An SV may not be changed by the host but may be changed bythe equipment or operator. The value of status variables may be queried by the host at anytime using the S1,F3/4 orS6,F19/20 transactions.6.3.4 DVVALs are variables that are valid only upon the occurrence of specific collection events. An attempt toread a variable item at the wrong time does not generate an error, but the data reported may not have relevantmeaning.6.3.5 Data Item Requirements for Multi-Head, Multi-Site Equipment  The identification for multi-head and multi-site data (variable items, status variables, events, etc.) is addressed in this specification through the use of statusvariables. In Table 5, the subscript v is used to denote the number of virtual testers, h is used to denote thenumber of tester heads, s to denote the number of tester head sites, and b to denote the number of bins orclasses.6.3.6 class, hard-bin, and soft-bin  Equipment is to maintain DVVALs which provide three levels of granularityfor test results: class, hard-bin, and soft-bin. Classes, hard-bins, and soft-bins are expected to be defined within aprocess program, and their names are made available as DVVALs. When device testing has completed, the processprogram is to determine the class, hard-bin, and soft-bin with which the device is to be associated, based on theresults of the testing. Finally, a summation of the number of devices associated with each class, hard-bin, and soft-bin is also maintained throughout the execution of a process program, and these are also made available asDVVALs.6.4 For multiple sites scenarios, if a variable is described as List by number of sites, then a list is expected, onevalue for each site.Table 5 Variable Item Mapping Table Variable Name Description SECS-II Type Class CommentsActiveSites List of test-sites that are to be tested.

Current edition approved by theNorth American Regional Standards Committee on November 22, 2002. Initially available at ",(0,s.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.semi.orgJanuary"},"www.semi.orgJanuary")," 2003; to be published March 2003. NOTICE: The designation of SEMI E123 was updatedduring the 0703 publishing cycle to reflect the additionof SEMI E123.1.NOTICE: This standard replaces SEMI E30.2, whichhas been removed from publication as of the March2003 (0303) publication cycle. 1 Purpose1.1 This document establishes a Specific EquipmentModel (SEM) for Handling equipment (HSEM). TheSEM consists of equipment characteristics andbehaviors that are applicable to this class of equipment.The intent of this document is to facilitate theintegration of Handling equipment into an automated(semiconductor) factory. This document accomplishesthis by defining an operational model for Handlingequipment as viewed by a factory automationcontroller. This definition provides a standard hostinterface and equipment operational behavior. 2 Scope2.1 The scope of this document is limited to thedefinition of Handling equipment behavior as perceivedby a host. It defines the view of the equipment throughthe equipment communications interface. It does notdefine the internal operation of the equipment. Itincludes a specific processing state model as the basisfor the behavior of all equipment of this class.2.2 This document expands the handler equipmentrequirements and capabilities in the areas of theprocessing state model, collection event, alarmdocumentation, remote commands, variable item, andprocess program management.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Communications  HSEM-compliant equipmentshall support the High Speed Messaging Service (HSMS) communication standard sending SEMI E5messages over TCP/IP. The reason behind thisrequirement is the amount of data available formonitoring from this class of equipment. Thisspecification deals only with the behavior of the handlerin communicating with the host.3.2 Multi-Process-Site HSEM Implementations  ThisSEM makes some demands and assumptions about theHandler with multiple process-sites in a configuration.These requirements are as follows:3.2.1 Handling equipment in a multiple process-siteconfiguration (i.e., lead conditioning site, electrical test-site) provides identification and status information (seeVariable Item) at both the site level and the subsitelevel. An example could be a handler with both a leadconditioning site and an electrical test-site, with theelectrical test-site containing multiple subsites (i.e., testheads). 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E30  Generic Model for Communications andControl of Manufacturing Equipment (GEM)SEMI E37  High-Speed SECS Message Services(HSMS) Generic ServicesSEMI E37.1  High-Speed SECS Message ServicesSingle Selected-Session Mode (HSMS-SS)NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 alignment location  Location that individualpackaged units are placed at the process-site (e.g.,electrical test).5.1.2 chaining  The process of execution overmultiple lots or runs with the same Process Programand the same handler operating conditions.5.1.3 electrical test-site  A process-site on theequipment which is coupled with electrical testing"),(0,s.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 11 --",">"),(0,s.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E123-0703 \xa9 SEMI 2003 2 equipment for purposes of performing packageelectrical testing.5.1.4 execution area  The area from which a currentcopy of the process program instructions is executed.5.1.5 handling equipment  An equipment classgenerally consisting of integrated mechanisms andcontrols for the purpose of manipulating packageddevices, trays, and tubes during the manufacturingprocess.5.1.6 indexing  The controlled stepped movement ofmaterial through the handler.5.1.7 kit  Specific items of hardware and software asspecified by the equipment manufacturer that adapt theequipment for a specific unit or unit package.5.1.8 leadconditioning site  A process-site on thehandler where some form of conditioning occurs on thepackage leadfingers (i.e., warming).5.1.9 leadfinger (or substrate connector lead)  (1) Inceramic packages, an area of refractory metal that hasbeen plated and is designated for the attachment to aprocess-site.

A state model consists of the following statemodel diagram, state definitions, and state transitiontables.6.2.2 A state model represents the host's view of thehandler, not necessarily the actual handler's internaloperations.6.2.3 All HSEM state model transitions shall bemapped sequentially into the actual equipment eventsthat satisfy the requirements of those transitions. Incertain implementations, the handler may enter a stateand have already satisfied all of the conditions requiredby the HSEM state model for transition to another state.The handler makes the required transition without anyadditional actions in this situation.6.2.4 Some equipment may need to include additionalstates.

Any alarm and abortconditions must be cleared and verified by an operatorbefore exit from this state.6.4.2 ABORTING (PROCESSING ACTIVE Sub-State) The handler has received an ABORT command. Allactivity is suspended. The handler is taking appropriateaction to bring itself and material to a safe statewhere possible. Unit or Lot data may be invalid or notavailable.6.4.3 ALARM PAUSED (PAUSE Sub-State)  Analarm has occurred in the PROCESS or PROCESSPAUSE states, and the handler is waiting for the alarmto be cleared.6.4.4 CHECKING (PROCESS PAUSED Sub-State) The handler verifies that updates made to the processprogram are valid (i.e., possible errors induced via anoperator during the pause).6.4.5 EXECUTING (PROCESS Sub-State)  Thehandler is processing material automatically and cancontinue to do so without external intervention. Thisstate may include interaction with the host or operator.6.4.6 IDLE  Awaiting a command. IDLE is free ofALARMS and error conditions.6.4.7 IDLE with ALARMS  An alarm has occurred inthe IDLE state, and the handler is waiting for all alarmsto be cleared.6.4.8 INIT  Handler initialization is occurring.6.4.9 LOADING (EXECUTING Sub-State)  This isthe state the next unit or units are transferred from theinput media or input buffers to the process site(s) and/orremoved from the process site(s) to sort categories.6.4.10 PAUSE (PROCESSING ACTIVE Sub-State) The PROCESS state will be suspended at thecompletion of the current unit or next opportunity.Actions to put the handler in a safe state are performed.The handler is awaiting a command (RESUME, STOP,or ABORT) or for alarm(s) to be cleared.6.4.11 PAUSED (PROCESS PAUSE Sub-State)  ThePROCESS state has been suspended, and the handler iswaiting for a command (RESUME, STOP, or ABORT).In this state, the operator may correct error conditionsthat do not affect the current Process Program selection.One of the possible corrective actions is for the operatorto manually align the units being processed.6.4.12 PAUSING (PROCESS PAUSE Sub-State) The PROCESS state will be suspended at thecompletion of the current unit or next opportunity. The handler cannot transition to PAUSED state until thecurrent unit is completed and the handler is in a safestate.6.4.13 AWAITING COMMAND (WORKING Sub-State)  Unit is moved to process-site (e.g., forelectrical test, to insert into contactor). Actuatorpiston(s) is extended to the alignment test site(s) ifapplicable. If contactors must be closed beforeprocessing can occur, then contactors are in the closedcondition. In this state, handler has completed allloading and is awaiting the next command from Host tosignal process complete.6.4.14 CONTACTOR OPEN (WORKING Sub-State) Unit process is complete and host issued a BREAK-CONTACT or RECONTACT command. (e.g. Actuatorpiston(s) is retracted from the alignment test site(s),contactors are open.) If RECONTACT command wasissued, unit will return to alignment for a step andrepeat. Otherwise Handler will remain in this state untila MAKE-CONTACT is received to resume processing.Commands such as STOP, ABORT and PAUSE arestill valid and follow the respective required transitions.6.4.15 PRELOADING (PROCESS Sub-State) Handler has received a PRELOAD-UNITS command tobegin preloading units to soak chambers or someequivalent process buffers. Units should not betransferred to process sites in this state. During thistime, test equipment may also go through its internalsetup process in parallel, such as testhead calibrations.If handler does not implement any process buffers, theremote command from Host must still be accepted andstate transition followed, in which case handler willtransition back to READY state immediately withPreloadComplete event sent to Host.6.4.16 PROCESS (PROCESS Sub-State)  This stateis the parent of those sub-states that refer to thepreparation and execution of a process program.6.4.17 PROCESS PAUSE (PAUSE Sub-State)  Thehandler is free of alarm conditions in the PAUSE state.6.4.18 READY (PROCESS Sub-State)  The handleris ready to begin processing and is awaiting a STARTor PRELOAD-UNITS command from the operator orhost.6.4.19 SETTING UP (PROCESS Sub-State)  Thehandler is satisfying conditions so that processing canbegin. This includes the receipt of any processprograms, the material to be processed, and machine-specific calibration.

Values of thesevariables are available to the host through collectionevent reports and host status queries.8.2 Requirements8.2.1 All generic variable items defined in SEMI E30are required by all HSEM equipment.8.2.2 Variable items required by HSEM arecategorized as follows: Common Variables (CVs)  Variables common toall handlers. Configuration-Specific Variables (CSVs) Variables associated with a specific configurationof the above equipment class.8.3 Data Types8.3.1 Equipment constants have various uses in HSEM,including the following: Equipment offsets that match the performance ofseveral pieces of equipment that would otherwiseperform differently due to inherent manufacturingdifferences. Examples are home values and motionaxis scaling factors. Setting the configuration of the equipment to allowfor different material specifications, equipment options, material flows, frequency of automaticfunctions, etc. Examples are media and yieldcheck frequency. Managing optional machine features. Examplesare constants that indicate whether optionalfeatures, such as automated media stackers, arepresent and control the configuration and functionof these optional subsystems when they arepresent.8.3.2 Status Variables are valid at all times. A statusvariable may not be changed by the host but may bechanged by the equipment or operator. The value ofstatus variables may be queried by the host at anytime.8.3.3 Variables that are valid upon the occurrence ofspecific collection event can be queried by the host. Anattempt to read a data variable at the wrong time shallnot generate an error, but the data reported may nothave relevant meaning.8.3.4 Data Item Requirements for Multi-Head, Multi-Site Equipment  The identification for multi-head andmulti-site data (data variable, status variables, events,etc.) is addressed in this specification through the use ofstatus variables with list structures. In the table below,the subheading Process-Site Group contains variablesthat must be available for all process-sites on thehandler equipment.

The HSEM also requires that the processprogram have a structure that enables the user to buildprocess programs with default conditions that can beoverridden for a run. The concepts of process programstructure and process program variable parameters arediscussed in the following sections. The HSEM alsorequires the following: Minimum, maximum, and default parameter valuesmust be defined for all process programs. Verification will occur when a process program isdownloaded to the equipment; the program syntaxmust be verified by the equipment manufacturer. Parameter validation will occur when a processprogram is downloaded. Parameters must be typeand range checked. Equipment should provide the functionality tomanually or interactively modify the parameters setin the process program. An error message must be generated from thehandler if the process program parameters areoutside the range of the machine calibration.9.2 Process Program Structure9.2.1 A handler process program must contain thefollowing information: Machine-specific configuration parameters, Process-Site-specific information section,  Media-Type-specific information section, and Unit (Unit/Package) information section.9.2.2 When combined, this information constitutes acomplete process program. It is emphasized that theHSEM does not enforce the exact format and data typeof each section. However, it does provide direction asto what each section should consist of.9.2.3 Machine-Specific Configuration Parameters Each brand or type of handler may have one or moremachine-specific configuration parameters. Examplesof such parameters would be input configuration,number of process-sites, and output configuration. Eventhough they are supplier-specific, these parametersnevertheless play a vital role in the overall generationor creation of a process program. Since the machine-specific parameters can differ from one equipmentmanufacturer to another, the HSEM does not specifythe exact number, data types, and format of theseparameters. These details are left to the sole discretionof the equipment manufacturer.9.2.3.1 In addition, handler process program mustsupport user defined mapping of logical test bincategories that are specific to test recipes and testequipment to handler sort categories. The mappingmust be easy to define and flexible allowing ranges tobe specified. Logical bin categories can range from 19999.9.2.4 Process-Site-Specific Information  Thisprocess-site-specific section contains informationnecessary for the configuration and execution of thevarious process-sites configured on the equipment.Each equipment may contain different process-siteconfigurations. Since these configurations will differ,the HSEM does not specify the exact number, data"),(0,s.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 21 --",">"),(0,s.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E123-0703 \xa9 SEMI 2003 12 types, and format of these parameters. HSEM doesrecommend a minimum list of data items for thecommon handler process-sites. These include:9.2.4.1 Thermal Conditioning Site Parameters Temperature Set Point Upper-Temp Guardband Set Point Lower-Temp Guardband Set Point Soak Time Test-Site Temp9.2.4.2 Test-Site Parameters Device Pick Up/Place Speed of Device Pick Up/Place Device Insertion/Retraction Speed of Device Insertion/Retraction Speed of Index Mechanism Insertion/Place Force/Stroke9.2.4.3 Lead Condition Site Parameters Device Pick Up/Place Speed of Device Pick Up/Place Speed of Insertion Insertion Force/Stroke9.2.4.4 Sort Sites Parameters Device Pick Up/Place Speed of Device Pick Up/Place Device Index Insertion Force/Stroke Sort Category Set Sort Category  Full/Empty/Partial Sort Media  In place or empty.9.2.5 Unit/Device-Specific Information  Theunit/device-specific section contains informationnecessary for the configuration and execution of thespecific units to be handled by the equipment. HSEMrequires a minimum list of data items be available todetermine package dimensions, terminal dimensions,package height, and coplanarity.9.2.6 Media-Type-Specific Information  The media-type-specific information section contains information necessary for the configuration and execution of thespecific media type in use on the equipment. HSEMrequires a minimum list of data items be available todetermine row/column count, X/Y distance to a cell,device height in tray, media height, and X/Y pitch.9.3 Methods of Process Program Creation  Themethod by which an equipment manufacturer creates aprocess program may be unique to that manufacturer.However, it is required that the customer at least begiven both of the following options for the creation of aprocess program.9.3.1 Off-Line Development  Using this method, thecustomer is given a set of software tools (processprogram compilers, decompilers, and debuggers) thatenables him/her to generate or create a process programusing the above mentioned information (flow,parameter, functional test, etc.). The newly generatedprocess program then is downloaded onto a specifichandler, verified, and is now ready to be selected andexecuted locally by the operator or remotely by the hostcomputer. If this process is used, the supplied softwaretools should closely mimic or simulate a handler so thata user can create a complete process program. In manysituations, minor adjustments may be needed to theprocess program on the equipment before it iscompletely ready for execution.9.3.2 On-Line Development  The second option is toenable the user to download the above-mentionedinformation (tables or files) onto the equipment andcreate the actual process program on the equipmentitself. 10 Remote Commands10.1 The purpose of this section is to identify remotecommands, command parameters, and valid commandsversus states in the processing state models.10.2 Requirements All the remote commands defined by HSEM arerequired. The alphanumeric strings defined by HSEM forremote commands and command parameters arerequired.

The followingminimum information is required: Class: Format: Description: 6.2 Data Types6.2.1 Equipment Constants (ECVs) can be changed by the host using S2,F15 (New Equipment Constant Send). Theoperator may be able to change some values, but the equipment does not change the values on its own. The value ofan equipment constant may be queried by the host at any time, using the S2,F13/14 transaction. They reside in non-volatile memory of the equipment. Equipment constants remain in effect until they are overwritten either by manualentry or by a S2,F15.6.2.2 Status Variables (SVs) are valid at all times. An SV may not be changed by the host but may be changed bythe equipment or operator. The value of status variables may be queried by the host at anytime using the S1,F3/4 orS6,F19/20 transactions.6.2.3 DVVALs are variables that are valid only upon the occurrence of specific collection events. An attempt toread a variable item at the wrong time does not generate an error, but the data reported may not have relevantmeaning.6.3 For multiple sites scenarios, if a variable is described as List by number of sites, then a list is expected, onevalue for each site.Table 4 Variable Item Mapping Table Variable Name Description Class SECS-II TypePhysical Handler GroupBufferID Identifier of the buffer.

Some alarmconditions may cause more than one type of alarm to be issued. For example, a parameter control error on overtemperature may also trip a protective device that makes the alarm irrecoverable without some intervention.

This specification describes a method for allowing equipment suppliers to provide a description of thevariables, events, exceptions, and physical equipment configuration available from their equipment. With thisinformation available for consumption by software systems, it can be used as a tool to aid the process of integratingequipment into a factorys automation system. 2 Scope2.1 In-scope2.1.1 This document specifies the classes that suppliers are to use to describe essential data, events, and exceptionsprovided by their equipment. The specification only describes information that is static in nature (that is,information that does not change dynamically while the equipment is running). This document also specifies aninterface that clients can use to access this information.2.1.2 This specification applies to all semiconductor manufacturing equipment that supports the data acquisitioninterface defined in the SEMI specification for Data Collection Management.2.2 Out of Scope2.2.1 This specification does not define any new behavior required of the equipment other than that necessary forretrieving information describing equipment configuration, interfaces, and available data, and keeping thisinformation current.2.2.2 The details of any underlying concepts and behavioral models (for example, carrier management,process/control job, etc.) that can be described by metadata are to be separately specified in a document dedicated tothose concepts. Only the ability to describe the fact that a supplier has implemented such a concept and that a clientcan discover this implementation and any data it can produce is in scope for this specification.2.2.3 This specification does not require that the metadata provided by the equipment be directly human readable.It is expected that applications will be written to organize and present this information to human users in a form thatis easier for end users to digest.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Abstract Model3.1.1 This specification is an abstract model only. Adjunct specifications must be developed to bind thisspecification to an implementation technology.3.2 Other Limitations3.2.1 This specification does not define the mechanism used for determining how to locate clients that are to receivenotifications defined by this specification. It assumes that the equipment has established a communications contextwith any clients that can submit requests, and has provided any context necessary to send notifications to thoseclients.3.2.2 This specification does not define the mechanism used for identifying or authenticating clients. It assumesthat clients can be uniquely identified, and that the equipment is capable of distinguishing requests originating fromdifferent clients. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E30  Generic Model for Communications and Control of Manufacturing Equipment (GEM)"),(0,s.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 45 --",">"),(0,s.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E125-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 20053 SEMI E39  Object Services Standard: Concept, Behavior, and ServicesSEMI E120  Provisional Specification for the Common Equipment Model (CEM)4.2 ISO Standards1 ISO 639:1988  Code for the representation of names of languagesISO 3166-1:1997  Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions  Part 1: CountrycodesISO 8601  Representations of dates and times, 1988-06-15ISO 8601 Draft Revision  Representations of dates and times, draft revision, 20004.3 Other StandardsAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI) X3.135-1992  Information Systems  Database Language  SQL(",(0,s.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.ansi.org"},"http://www.ansi.org"),") 2 Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC 1776  Tags for the Identification of Languages, ed.

Unadorned associations are not used,for economy of notation. See the UML 1.4 specification, Section 3.43 for details. All role names are public bydefault; therefore the visibility symbols are not used.6.1.3.1.1 Open diamond adornments indicate that instances of the target class may be shared among aggregateclasses. Closed diamond adornments indicate that target instances belong to at most one composite class. The part-whole semantics of the aggregation/composition symbol is not significant in this specification. See the UML 1.4specification, sections 3.43.2.5 and 3.48 for further information.6.1.3.1.2 Some diagrams use the UML XOR constraint where applicable.

In a Request-Reply exchange, the initiator sends a single request message to the receiver, and the receiver sends a single replymessage to that request back to the initiator. Fire-and-Forget messages are messages that involve a sender and areceiver. In a Fire-and-Forget exchange, the sender sends a single message to the receiver, with no associatedresponse.6.1.6 Operation Argument Definition Table  The table below provides an example of the tables used to list anddescribe arguments for interface operations defined in this specification.Table 4 Operation Argument DefinitionsArgument Description Kind FormSee list below See list below 6.1.6.1 Argument  Specifies the name of the argument.6.1.6.2 Kind  Specifies whether the argument is an in, out, or error argument for the operation.

Diagnostics, health monitoring, or other supplier-provided applications that understand thedetails of specific equipment types, for example, can also discover and use common equipment-specificconfiguration and data without requiring manual assistance. 8 Overview8.1 Equipment Metadata Organization8.1.1 Figure 2 shows the concepts that are included in this specification and their relationship to the SEMI E120Common Equipment Model. A brief description of the purpose of each metadata concept is provided in this sectiononly as an overview. For the detailed specification of the corresponding classes, refer to Section 10. Figure 2Organization of Metadata Concept 8.1.2 Equipment Node Description8.1.2.1 This specification defines classes that provide a way to associate events, exceptions, parameters, and SEMIE39 ObjTypes with any node in the physical equipment structure. SEMI E120 defines the classes that are used todescribe the physical equipment structure; this specification defines the classes that link E120 equipment nodes withthe events, exceptions, parameters, and ObjTypes that they produce. Equipment node description classes are definedin Section 10.3 .8.1.3 Parameters8.1.3.1 This specification defines classes that can be used to describe any variables that are provided by theequipment, and refers to all such variables as Parameters. Parameters can be used to model any concept that canbe represented as a data type. For example, the SEMI E30 concepts of equipment constants, data variables, andstatus variables can all be represented by a parameter. Any type of data that the equipment can produce (forexample, measurement results on metrology equipment) can be represented by a Parameter. Parameters can only be"),(0,s.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 49 --",">"),(0,s.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E125-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 20057 defined by an equipment node, an SEMI E39 ObjType, or an exception. Parameter description is defined in Section10.4 .8.1.4 Type and Units8.1.4.1 This specification provides a way to describe the data types and units used on the equipment to representParameters. For example, if the equipment defines several Parameters that have a structured data type consisting ofan integer, a string, and an array of Booleans, this specification provides classes that can be used to describe thestructure of that data type. For numeric data types, this specification defines classes that can be used to describe theunits that a value of that data type has. For example, if some Parameter represents a capacitance in microfarads, thisspecification can be used to describe the microfarad unit itself, as well as how to indicate that the parameters valueis in units of microfarads. Parameter type description is defined in Section 10.4.11 , and units description is definedin Section 10.5.5 .8.1.5 State Machine and Events8.1.5.1 This specification defines classes that can be used to describe the state machines (and the correspondingtransitions and events) that are implemented by the equipment. These classes can be used to describe any SEMI-defined state machine or any supplier-defined state machine. This specification also defines classes that can be usedto describe the Parameters that are available for reporting when a specific event occurs. State machine description isdefined in Section 10.8 .8.1.6 SEMI Objects8.1.6.1 This specification defines classes that can be used to describe any SEMI E39 ObjTypes that areimplemented by the equipment. SEMI ObjType state machines and events are described using the same classes thatare used to describe state machines. ObjType attributes are described using the same classes that are used todescribe Parameters and types. Description of ObjType services is not supported. SEMI ObjType description isdefined in Section 10.8 .8.1.7 Exceptions8.1.7.1 his specification defines classes that can be used to describe the existence of error conditions that theequipment can detect and report as exceptions. An exception can represent any SEMI standard E30 alarm orequipment-supplier-defined exception that can be reported to clients. Exception description is defined in Section10.7 .8.2 Accessing Equipment Metadata8.2.1 Equipment metadata is directly associated with each unique equipment installation within a factory. Access tometadata is provided by a collection of operations available from a specific equipment installation.
