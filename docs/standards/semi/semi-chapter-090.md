SEMI D12-95 © SEMI 1995, 20033 RELATED INFORMATION 1NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI D12 and is not intended to modify or supercedethe official standard. Rather, this note describes methods for producing FPD substrate edges which may be underdevelopment. Publication was authorized by full letter ballot procedures. R1-1 Current PracticeR1-1.1 The edges of FPD substrates are modifiedduring the substrate manufacturing process so that, insubsequent panel processing, operator safety isimproved and particulate generation is minimized.Currently, a chamfered edge process is in general use.This modifies the two corners of each edge as shownin Figure 1. R1-2 Future DevelopmentsR1-2.1 Other edge treatments may prove moreefficient, and several alternate approaches are underdevelopment. Two of these are a Radiused Edge andRounded Edge, shown in Figures R1-1 and R1-2. Theradiused edge initially appears simple, but appropriatevalues of R, for various substrate thicknesses (T), arebeing examined for manufacturability. For cases whereR &gt; T, the proper edge blend, where R intercepts thesubstrate pattern and back surfaces, may prove difficultto define and control.

SEMI D16-0998 © SEMI 19981 SEMI D16-0998SPECIFICATION FOR MECHANICAL INTERFACE BETWEEN FLATPANEL DISPLAY MATERIAL HANDLING SYSTEM AND TOOL PORT This specification was technically approved by the Flat Panel Display Equipment Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Flat Panel Display Committee. Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Stadards Committee July 1998. Published on SEMI OnLine September 1998; print versionpublished September 1998. 1 Purpose1.1 This specification defines featu re requirements onand about tool ports of process tools used inmanufacturing of flat panel displays. These featurerequirements facilitate the interfacing of transportequipment to the tool by standardizing the featurerequirements. Such standards are intended to promotecost-effective interfacing while preserving freedom ofchoice in material handling equipment. 2 Scope2.1 These standards define mechan ical features on orabout the process tool port, and in front of or on the toolface. Although these features are intended for specificfunctions, they do not set design requirements for anyparticular functionality. The interface requirements aremeant to be universal and to avoid the promotion of anyparticular form of transport. Therefore, they are usefulfor the interfacing of continuous direct WIP transports,such as conveyors, or discrete vehicles of foreseeablefuture design, such as AGVs, to the process tool port.The dimensions incorporated in the standard apply tosingle panel handling as well as substrate carriers. 3 Limitations3.1 Current display manufacturing utilizes severalsubstrate sizes, many of them non-standard. Thisproposed interface specification includes dimensionsfor the substrate sizes of 550  650 mm, and 600  720mm and anticipates the establishment of standarddimension in future substrate sizes. For these futuresubstrate sizes, a universal dimensioning method basedon substrate size may be possible. 4 Referenced Documents4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI D5  Standard Size for Flat Panel DisplaySubstratesSEMI D11  Specification for Flat Panel DisplayGlass Substrate Cassettes 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 facial datum plane  the plan e coincident withthe front face of the tool and perpendicular to thehorizontal and vertical datum planes.5.1.2 horizontal datum plane  the plane coincidentwith the top surface of the floor and perpendicular tothe facial datum plane of the tool.5.1.3 vertical datum plane  the pla ne that bisects thetool port and is perpendicular to the horizontal andfacial datum planes.5.2 Functional Description of Dim ensions5.2.1 X1  width of exclusion zone reserved forvertical material handling devices; maximum.5.2.2 X2  width of the tool port at Z7 below toolload plane.

Thecoupling pins are located by dimensions x14 and y13relative to the bilateral and facial datum planesrespectively.6.5.1.1 Coupling Pin Shapes  The p hysicalalignment mechanism on the bottom of the wafercarrier consists of features (not specified in thisstandard) that mate with three pins underneath. Asshown in Figure 5 and defined in Table 3, each pin isradially symmetric about the vertical center axis lineand can be seen as the intersection of a cylinder ofdiameter d1 and a sphere of radius r3 (which mightcontact a flat plate). An additional rounding radius r5provides contact with angled mating surfaces, and blendradii r4 and r6 smooth the resulting edges. The finalroughness height of the overall surface finish must beless than or equal to r7. Dimensions r2 and z13 havezero tolerance because they only give a distance toanother toleranced dimension. (Dimensions inparenthesis are not part of the requirements in thisstandard but are intended to clarify the preparation ofmanufacturing instructions.)6.5.1.2 The three features on the botto m of the cassettethat mate with the coupling pins must provide a lead-incapability that corrects a cassette misalignment of up to10 mm (0.4 in.) in any horizontal direction, although 15mm (0.6 in.) is recommended. The exclusion zones forthe three coupling features on the cassette are shown inFigure 3 and Table 1 and specified by dimensions x14,z9 and r1.6.5.2 Cassette Physical Alignment In terface Type B This interface consists of three features, a v-rail, floatsurface, and facial datum plane v-groove. The v-rail and

&lt;!-- Page 18 --&gt;

SEMI D17-0200 © SEMI 1998, 20003 float surface are located on the bottom of the cassetteand mate with the two v-rail rollers and one floatsurface roller, respectively, mounted on the toolinterface. The facial datum plane v-groove is locatedabout the facial datum plane through the bottom surfaceof the cassette and mates with the facial datum planelock pin located on the tool interface shown in Figure 3.The v-rail roller and the float surface roller are locatedby dimensions x15 and x16 relative to the bilateraldatum plane, respectively, shown in Figure 6. Thedimensiona relative to the facial datum plane for the v-rail rollers are not specified but recommended to belocated furthest from and symmetrical about the facialdatum plane as shown in Figures 3 and 6. The floatsurface roller revolute axis must lie on the facial datumplane.6.5.2.1 The v-rail and float surface rol lers are definedin Figure 7 and Table 4. Each roller is radiallysymmetric about the revolute axis. The rollers arecircumferentially radiused of dimension r8. Thediameter of the rollers is not specified, but thetangential surface created by dimension r8 must lie onthe horizontal datum plane. The facial datum plane lockpin radius is equal to r8 and must be positioned into thefacial datum plane v-groove to fully constrain thecassette to the facial datum plane. The facial datumplane lock pin is translated out of the facial datum planev-groove to allow the cassette to be rolled in and out ofthe tool interface. Although only three rollers arespecified, it is recommended to increase the totalnumber of rollers so that the cassette is fully supportedwhile being loaded and unloaded to the tool interface.All rollers, except for the v-rail and float roller, must bepositioned so that the tangent of the r8 dimension liesbelow the horizontal datum plane.6.5.2.2 The three features on the botto m of the cassettethat mate with the rollers and lock pin must provide alead-in capability that corrects a cassette misalignmentof up to 10 mm (0.4 in.) in any horizontal direction,although 15 mm (0.6 in.) is recommended. The v-railand facial datum plane v-groove are not specified butrecommended to be inverted v-shaped grooves. The v-rail is recommended to extend the full length of thecassette from the cassette front to the cassette rear. Thefloat surface is not specified but recommended to be aflat surface extending the full length of the cassettefrom the cassette front to the cassette rear. Theexclusion zones for these features are shown in Figures3 and 6 and specified by dimensions x15 and x16through x22.6.5.3 Cassette Physical Alignment In terface Type C To be developed.6.6 Conveyor Rails  If the casse tte is to betransported on roller conveyors, each conveyor rail should extend the maximum distance from front toback. The exclusion zones for conveyor rails are shownin Figures 3 and 6 and specified by dimensions x13 andx22 and extend to the outer boundary of the cassette.6.7 Conveying Surface  If the ca ssette is to betransported on roller conveyors that support the entirebottom of the cassette, the bottom surface excluding thev-rail, v-groove, and float roller zones is to be used.The location of this surface with respect to thehorizontal datum plane is specified by dimension z3.6.8 Substrate Orientation  The s ubstrates must behorizontal when the carrier is placed on the coupling.6.9 Cassette Sides and Rear  Fig ure 2 shows a topview of the boundaries of the cassette side domains(which contain the parts of the cassette higher than z4above the horizontal datum plane and lower than z9above the top substrate). Table 1 defines the dimensionsshown in this and following figures.6.10 Cassette Top  The boundari es of the cassettetop domain contain any part of the cassette hither thanz9 above the top substrate.6.11 Cassette Bottom  Figure 3 sh ows a bottomview of the boundaries of the cassette bottom domain(which contains any part of the cassette lower than z4above the horizontal datum plane). When the cassette isfully down, the cassette placement sensing pads mustbe z2 above the horizontal datum plane.6.12 Vertical Dimensions6.12.1 Figure 4 shows the vertical dim ensions of theleft half of the cassette as viewed from the rear. Notethat z5 (the height of the bottom nominal substrateseating plane above the horizontal datum plane) and z8(the distance between adjacent nominal substrateseating planes) are given as reference dimensions withno tolerance. This means that the sum of actual heightvariations in the cassette from the horizontal datumplane to the mizo tooth or slot holding each substratemust be contained within the tolerance of z6 with nofurther stack-up at each higher substrate.6.12.2 The open space for the substra te extractionvolume is indicated by dimensions x6 and y7 and issymmetric about the bilateral and facial datum planes,respectively. The top of the extraction volume is z7above the nominal substrate seating plane and itsbottom is half of the minimum z7 dimension above thenominal substrate seating plane. The cassette must giveextra horizontal clearance once the substrate is pickedup from wherever it ends up (within the bounds of thesubstrate pick-up volume) after transport in the cassette.6.12.3 The open space for the substra te set-downvolume is indicated by dimensions x5 and y6 and is

&lt;!-- Page 19 --&gt;

SEMI D17-0200 © SEMI 1998, 2000 4 symmetric about the bilateral and facial datum planes,respectively. The top of this volume is half of z7 abovethe nominal substrate seating plane and its bottom is z6above the nominal substrate seating plane. Thesubstrate should be placed within the bounds of thesubstrate set-down volume to avoid touching the edgeof the substrate to the side of the cassette.6.12.4 The substrate pickup zone is d efined by an areaindicated by dimensions x5 and y5 and is symmetricabout the bilateral and facial datum planes,respectively. Its top and bottom are the upper and lowertolerance of z6 around the nominal substrate seatingplane. If a substrate is placed in the substrate set-downvolume and is then pushed to the rear of the cassette,then the entire bottom of the substrate must becontained in the substrate pick-up zone.6.13 Particle Generation  The ca ssette will not addmore than 0.05 particles/cm2 of a size ≥ 0.5 m (PSL equivalent) per substrate pass per shipping cycle. Theshipping cycle is to be defined by the customer.6.14 Inner and Outer Radii  All c oncave featuresmay have as much as a 1 mm (0.04 in.) radius to allowfor cleaning and to prevent contaminant build-up. Allrequired convex features (such as the robotic handlingflanges and the corners of the cassette top and bottomdomains) must also have a minimum radius of 1 mm(0.04 in.) to prevent large stress contacts of the cassettethat might cause wear and particles.6.15 Dimensional Tolerances  W idth (W), Length(L), and Height (H): ± 5 mm6.16 Special Design Features6.16.1 Compatible with automated cl eaning tools.6.16.2 External features that are comp atible withmaterial handling systems such as, but not limited to,Guided Vehicles, Stocker, and Conveyors.

Determination of the suitability of the materialherein is solely the responsibility of the user. A1-1 Application NotesA1-1.1 The shape of the teeth holding the substrates is not specified in this standard. The tooth surface that touchesthe substrate should have a large radius to minimize stress on the substrate and tooth.A1-1.2 Extra clearance (larger than the pitch) has been added below the bottom substrate (for non-randomsequential access to the substrates with a faster or less precise robot). To increase the stability of Type A Cassettes,the points on the cassette bottom that are the most distant from the lines connecting each pair of coupling pinsshould be made as close as practical to the horizontal datum plane so that the cassette cannot tip very far off of thekinematic coupling.

The purchaser needs tospecify the time period, the number of cycles and anyspecial conditions to which the cassettes will beexposed. It is under these conditions that the cassettesmust remain in compliance with the requirements listedin Section 6.5.2 Temperature Ranges  The p urchase of thecassettes needs to specify three sets of temperatures towhich the cassettes might be exposed. An operatingtemperature range is the set of environmentaltemperatures in which the cassettes will remain incompliance with the requirements listed in Section 6(e.g. 23°C ± 5°C). A temporary temperature range isthe set of environmental temperatures to which thecassettes can be exposed such that when the cassettesreturn to the operating temperature range, the cassetteswill be in compliance with the requirements listed inSection 6 (e.g. 90°C maximum during cleaning of thecassette). Also, the purchaser needs to specify a rangeof temperatures for the substrates that might be insertedin the cassettes.5.3 Pitch and Capacity Options  The purchaserneeds to specify the pitch and capacity of the cassettes.Table 2 provides two options of pitch and capacity.Additional pitch and capacity options are not yetdefined, but should be specified in the same manner.5.4 Material  To be agreed upon between supplierand user. Construction may be of one or more moldedor machines parts. 6 Requirements6.1 Dimensions  Most of the dim ensions of thecassette are determined with respect to the threeorthogonal datum planes defined in that standard: thehorizontal datum plane, the facial datum plane, and thebilateral datum plane (see Figure 1).6.2 Cassette Physical Alignment In terface  Thecassette should be registered to the tool interface by oneof the three following types of registrations (Type A, Bor C). The locations of the registration features havebeen chosen such that all three types may coexist on thesame cassette6.2.1 Cassette Physical Alignment In terface-Type A This registration consists of three features (notspecified, but recommended to be inverted V-shaped

&lt;!-- Page 32 --&gt;

SEMI D18-0299 E © SEMI 1999, 20013 grooves) placed on the bottom of the cassette that matewith three coupling pins located on the tool interface.The coupling pins are located by dimensions x14 andy13 relative to the bilateral and facial datum planesrespectively.6.2.1.1 Coupling Pin Shapes  The p hysicalalignment mechanism on the bottom of the wafercarrier consists of features (not specified in thisstandard) that mate with three pins underneath. Asshown in Figure 5 and defined in Table 3, each pin isradially symmetric about the vertical center axis lineand can be seen as the intersection of a cylinder ofdiameter d1 and a sphere of radius r3 (which mightcontact a flat plate). An additional rounding radius r5provides contact with angled mating surfaces, and blendradii r4 and r6 smooth the resulting edges. The finalroughness height of the over-all surface finish must beless than or equal to r7. Dimensions r2 and z13 havezero tolerance because they only give a distance toanother toleranced dimension. (Dimensions inparenthesis are not part of the requirements in thisstandard but are intended to clarify the preparation ofmanufacturing instructions.)6.2.1.2 The three features on the botto m of the cassettethat mate with the coupling pins must provide a lead-incapability that corrects a cassette misalignment of up to10 mm (0.4 in.) in any horizontal direction, although 15mm (0.6 in.) is recommended. The exclusion zones forthe three coupling features on the cassette is shown inFigure 3 and Table 1 and specified by dimensions x14,z9 and r1.6.2.2 Cassette Physical Alignment In terface-Type B Consists of three features, a V-rail, float surface, andfacial datum plane V-groove. The V-rail and floatsurface are located on the bottom of the cassette andmate with the two V-rail rollers and one float surfaceroller, respectively, mounted on the tool interface. Thefacial datum plane V-groove is located about the facialdatum plane through the bottom surface of the cassetteand mates with the facial datum plane lock pin locatedon the tool interface shown in Figure 3. The V-railroller and the float surface roller are located bydimensions x15 and x16 relative to the bilateral datumplane respectively shown in Figure 6. The dimensionrelative to the facial datum plane for the V-rail rollersare not specified but recommended to be locatedfurthest from and symmetrical about the facial datumplane as shown in Figure 3 and 6. The float surfaceroller revolute axis must lie on the facial datum plane.6.2.2.1 The V-rail and float surface ro llers are definedin Figure 7 and Table 4. Each roller is radiallysymmetric about the revolute axis. The rollers arecircumferentially radiused of dimension r8. Thediameter of the rollers is not specified but the tangential surface created by dimension r8 must lie on thehorizontal datum plane. The facial datum plane lock pinradius is equal to r8 and must be positioned into thefacial datum plane V-groove to fully constrain thecassette to the facial datum plane. The facial datumplane lock pin is translated out of the facial datum planeV-groove to allow the cassette to be rolled in and out ofthe tool interface. Although only three rollers arespecified it is recommended to increase the totalnumber of rollers so that the cassette is fully supportedwhile being loaded and unloaded to the tool interface.All rollers except for the V-rail and float roller must bepositioned so that the tangent of the r8 dimension liesbelow the horizontal datum plane.6.2.2.2 The three features on the botto m of the cassettethat mate with the rollers and lock pin must provide alead-in capability that corrects a cassette misalignmentof up to 10 mm (0.4 in.) in any horizontal direction,although 15 mm (0.6 in.) is recommended. The V-railand facial datum plane V-groove are not specified butrecommended to be inverted V-shaped grooves. The V-rail is recommended to extend the full length of thecassette from the cassette front to the cassette rear. Thefloat surface is not specified but recommended to be aflat surface extending the full length of the cassettefrom the cassette front to the cassette rear. Theexclusion zones for these features are shown in Figure 3and 6 and specified by dimensions x15, x16 throughx22.6.2.3 Cassette Physical Alignment In terface-Type C to be developed.6.3 Conveyor Rails  If the casse tte is to be used onroller conveyors, each conveyor rail should extend themaximum distance from front to back. The exclusionzones for conveyor rails are shown in Figure 3 and 6and specified by dimensions x13 and x22 and extends tothe outer boundary of the cassette.6.4 Conveying SurfaceIf the cas sette is to betransported on roller conveyors that support the entirebottom of the cassette, the bottom surface excluding theV-rail, V-groove, and float roller zones is to be used.The location of this surface with respect to thehorizontal datum plane is specified by dimension z3.6.5 Substrate Orientation and Num bering  Thesubstrates must be horizontal when the carrier is placedon the coupling, and the substrates are numbered inincreasing order from bottom to top (so the bottomsubstrate is substrate number 1, the next substrate up issubstrate number 2, etc.)6.6 Cassette Sides and Rear  Fig ure 2 shows a topview of the boundaries of the cassette side domains(which contain the parts of the cassette higher than z4above the horizontal datum plane and lower than z9

&lt;!-- Page 33 --&gt;

Table 1 defines the dimensionsshown in this and following figures.6.7 Cassette Top  The boundari es of the cassette topdomain contain any part of the cassette higher than z9above the top substrate.6.8 Cassette Bottom  Figure 3 sh ows a bottom viewof the boundaries of the cassette bottom domain (whichcontains any part of the cassette lower than z4 above thehorizontal datum plane). When the cassette is fullydown, the cassette placement sensing pads must be z2above the horizontal datum plane.6.9 Vertical Dimensions  Figure 4 shows thevertical dimensions of the left half of the cassette asviewed from the rear. Note that z5 (the height of thebottom nominal substrate seating plane above thehorizontal datum plane) and z8 (the distance betweenadjacent nominal substrate seating planes) are given asreference dimensions with no tolerance. This meansthat the sum of actual height variations in the cassettefrom the horizontal datum plane to the mizo tooth orslot holding each substrate must be contained within thetolerance of z6 with no further stack-up at each highersubstrate.6.9.1 The open space for the substra te extractionvolume is indicated by dimensions x6 and y7 and issymmetric about the bilateral and facial datum planes,respectively. The top of the extraction volume is z7above the nominal substrate seating plane and itsbottom is half of the minimum z7 dimension above thenominal substrate seating plane. The cassette must giveextra horizontal clearance once the substrate is picked up from wherever it ends up (within the bounds of thesubstrate pick-up volume) after transport in the cassette.6.9.2 The open space for the substra te set-downvolume is indicated by dimensions x5 and y6 and issymmetric about the bilateral and facial datum planes,respectively. The top of this volume is half of z7 abovethe nominal substrate seating plane and its bottom is z6above the nominal substrate seating plane. Thesubstrate should be placed within the bounds of thesubstrate set-down volume to avoid touching the edgeof the substrate to the side of the cassette.6.9.3 The substrate pick-up volume is defined by anarea indicated by dimensions x5 and y5 and issymmetric about the bilateral and facial datum planes,respectively. Its top and bottom are the upper andlower tolerance of z6 around the nominal substrateseating plane. If a substrate is placed in the substrateset-down volume and is then pushed to the rear of thecassette, then the entire bottom of the substrate must becontained in the substrate pick-up volume.6.10 Pitch and Capacity  Table 2 shows thedifferent options with regard to the substrate pitch(spacing) and the cassette capacity.6.11 Inner and Outer Radii  All c oncave featuresmay have as much as a 1 mm (0.04 in.) radius to allowfor cleaning and to prevent contaminant build-up. Allrequired convex features (such as the robotic handlingflanges, and the corners of the cassette top and bottomdomains) must also have a minimum radius of 1 mm(0.04 in.) to prevent small contact patches with largestresses that might cause wear and particles.

A1-1 Application NotesA1-1.1 The shape of the teeth holding the substrates isnot specified in this standard. The tooth surface thattouches the substrate should have a large radius tominimize stress on the substrate and tooth.A1-1.2 Extra clearance (larger than the pitch) has beenadded below the bottom substrate (for non-randomsequential access to the substrates with a faster or lessprecise robot). To increase the stability of Type ACassettes the points on the cassette bottom that are themost distant from the lines connecting each pair ofcoupling pins should be made as close as practical tothe horizontal datum plane so that the cassette cannottip very far off of the kinematic coupling.
