SEMI D23-0999 © SEMI 19991 SEMI D23-0999GUIDE FOR COST OF EQUIPMENT OWNERSHIP (CEO)CALCULATION FOR FPD EQUIPMENT This guide was technically approved by the Global Flat Panel Display Equipment Committee and is the directresponsibility of the Japanese Flat Panel Display Equipment Committee. Current edition approved by theJapanese Regional Standards Committee on June 1, 1999. Initially available on SEMI OnLine August 1999;to be published September 1999. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this document is to provide astandard, simple CEO calculation method forevaluating FPD manufacturing equipment. With thisdocument, the following merits can be expected:1.1.1 Both panel and equipment manuf acturers, aswell as material manufacturers can work from the samestandard with regard to cost.1.1.2 Panel manufacturers basis for equipmentcomparison will become clear, which will, in turn, helpin equipment selection.1.1.3 The document will serve to cla rify cost reductionitems as well as benchmark cost reduction activities.1.1.4 Direction for improvement for equipmentmanufacturers will become clear.1.1.5 By doing a separate analysis, c omparison, andevaluation of lines, equipment for different substratesizes will become simpler. 2 Scope2.1 This standard focuses on each equipment in theFPD production line. It is used to define the calculationmethod for cost of installing/operating that equipment,to define the calculation method for productivity of thatequipment, and to quantify CEO of that equipment. 2.2 It is necessary to clarify the su bstrate sizes that canbe handled by this equipment. However, this standarddoes not deal with the equipment process performance.It takes the point of view that each panel manufacturershould evaluate each equipments process performance,including yield, based on their own processrequirements.2.3 This standard does not purport to address all of thesafety issues associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicablity of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This standard does not attempt to include allelements necessary for equipment evaluation, and maybe seen as incomplete from certain perspectives.However, it is believed that it will serve as thefoundation for comparative evaluations. 4 Referenced StandardsNone. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions for each of the item s are listed in thefollowing table.

See Figures 1 and 2.2 An asymmetric orientation corner is specified for purposes of mechanical orientation and operators visual confirmation of orientation within acassette. Optical means of identifying orientation is under investigation. See Figure 5.3 Quality Area is that area in which the specified criteria apply.4 Total thickness variation is the peak to valley (TIR) of the entire substrate front surface relative to a reference plane when the substrate backsurface is constrained against a vacuum chuck. This scale is typically important for some film deposition and lithography processes. See Figure6.5 Local thickness variation is the absolute value of the maximum deviation of the substrate from a plane constructed in any 100130 mm squarearea, within the Quality Area, when the substrate back surface is constrained against a vacuum chuck. This scale is typically important forlithographic stepper processes.6 Waviness is the rms (root mean square) surface profile, within the quality area, over 0.88 mm spatial wavelengths.7 See Figure 3.8 See Figure 2.9 See Figure 4.10 This table applies to the indicated edge length ranges and thicknesses.11 Example: For an 800  950 mm substrate, the effective process area, which excludes portions not processable for physical reasons, would be ≥760  ≥ 910 mm.

SEMI D25-0600E © SEMI 2000, 20031 SEMI D25-0600 E SPECIFICATION FOR FLAT PANEL DISPLAY SUBSTRATE SHIPPINGCASE This specification was technically approved by the Global Flat Panel Display Committee and is the directresponsibility of the Japanese Flat Panel Display Committee. Current edition approved by the JapaneseRegional Standards Committee on April 21, 2000. Initially available on SEMI OnLine May 2000; to bepublished June 2000.E This document was editorially modified in October 2003 to correct general editorial errors. Changes weremade to Sections 3.2.2, 6.2.8.1, 6.2.9.1, and A3-1 (figure). 1 Purpose1.1 This document provides the packing and shippingspecifications and/or guides for FPD glass substrates,which are called fourth generation substrates (800 950  0.7 mm or 800  950  1.1 mm).1.2 The objective of this document is to provide cost-effective packing and shipping in terms of packingmaterials, storage, and shipping, while making sure thatpacking meets the quality and automation requirements. 2 Scope2.1 This document defines a specification for a full boxtype shipping case (see Figure 2) to be used for packingand shipping of 4 th generation FPD glass substratesfrom the manufacturer of the glass substrate to the user.2.2 The application of this packing specification islimited to the following four FPD glass substrates:2.2.1 Bare glass substrates which can be used as arraysubstrates, and do not have film deposition.2.2.2 Bare glass substrates which can be used as facingsubstrates and color filter substrates, and do not havefilm deposition.2.2.3 Array substrates which do have film deposition.2.2.4 Facing substrates and color filter substrates whichdo have film deposition.2.3 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use.

SEMI D25-0600E © SEMI 2000, 20033 6.2 Packing Box Dimensions  Figure 5 shows the key dimensions and tolerances of the packing box for the fullbox type.6.2.1 Packing Box Loading and Unloading6.2.1.1 Vertical loading shall be used to load andunload the glass substrates to and from the packing box(see Figure 6).6.2.1.2 Vertical loading requires a tall loader/unloaderbecause of the height of the loading direction. Theceiling height of the room where the loading equipmentis installed has to be designed accordingly.6.2.1.3 A suggested method for loading/unloadingsubstrates from the shipping case with an automaticvertical loader/unloader is to tilt the box as shown inFigure 7. Align the substrates on one side of the clear-ance of the mizo and proceed with loading/unloading.6.2.1.4 An alternative method for loading/unloadingwould be to rotate the packing box 90°, as shown inFigure 8.6.2.1.5 Loading and unloading the substrates also canbe done manually without using an automaticloader/unloader.6.2.2 Packing Box Size6.2.2.1 The shorter side of the substrate (side W, or the800 mm side) as the vertical direction (direction z inFigure 5) during shipping. This way, the size of thesubstrate determines the inside measurements of thepacking box, H: 800 mm (direction z), W: 950 mm(direction x).6.2.2.2 The outside measurements of the packing boxshall be H: 980 mm  W: 1,200 mm  L: &lt; 1100mm(Figure 5). It is important to note that the height of 980mm indicates that it is possible to stack up the packingboxes, i.e. 980 mm  2 = 1,960 mm, and still be lessthan the possible maximum height (2,000 mm) of thetruck load.6.2.2.3 The length of the packing box is determined bythe calculated product of the pitch size between thesubstrates times the number of substrates stored in thebox. the length (L in Figure 5) of the packing boxcannot exceed 1,100 mm6.2.3 Packing Box Lid6.2.3.1 The packing box must prevent the substratesfrom getting contaminated as well as to give pressure tothe substrates for securing them from both top andbottom. The lid must securely seal and be able to latchclosed to the packing box by a lock. The latchingmechanism must allow easy automatic lock and unlockas well. 6.2.3.2 The lid shall also have automatic and manualopening/closing capability. The inside of the lid iscovered with a shock absorber that functions to securethe glass substrates by pressing them from the top andbottom.6.2.4 Mizo Pitch and Capacity of Packing Boxes6.2.4.1 The sag, h4 = 20 mm will be for the substratesof the size 800  950  0.7 mm as shown in Appendix3, when a sudden turn, acceleration, or braking duringshipping forces a 1G acceleration against the substrates.From this point of view, the pitch required here is alittle bit larger than 20 mm. However, since all thesubstrates in the box are affected by the acceleration atthe same time and in the same direction, the distancebetween the substrates will remain constant whichmeans the substrates should not touch each other.6.2.4.2 The mizo pitch, must be standardized by eachshipping case supplier, but must range from a minimumof 9 mm to a maximum of 22 mm ± 0.2 mm. Table 1shows possible number of substrates per shipping caseat a given pitch.Table 1 Pitch and Number of SubstratesPitch (mm) Number of Substrates (pc)22 4018 5015 6011 809 100 6.2.4.3 The first mizo clearance (see Figure 9) is to bemore than 40.0 mm at the center of the groove. Thedistance from the reference plane to the first mizo is thesum of the first mizo clearance and the thickness of theside of the box which is the reference plane, and itsallowance is ± 1.0 mm. The allowance of cumulativepitch distance is less than ± 2.0 mm, and that of eachpitch is less than ± 1.0 mm.6.2.4.4 Mizo clearance shall be designed to store theglass substrate of a thickness ranging from 0.7 mm to1.1 mm.6.2.5 Size of Exposed Portion6.2.5.1 In this document, the size of f1 in Figure 10 iscalled the size of the exposed portion which is set asf1 = 100 mm. Size h in Figure 10 is the shorter side ofthe substrate at 800 mm. The size of f2 is 700 mmwhich means one eighth of the whole substrate isexposed.

SEMI D25-0600E © SEMI 2000, 2003 4 6.2.6 Reference Plane6.2.6.1 The reference plane needs to be determined asfollows from three directions, x, y, and z in Figure 5 forautomatic transferring:x: Both sides or center positiony: Both sides or center positionz: Bottom surface of the box (not the bottom of theskid described later) 6.2.6.2 Specifically use the small area as a referencesurface in Figure 11. The detail of the position and sizeof the reference surfaces shall be standardized to use acompatible reference for two different design boxes.Also the center line of substrate is automaticallydefined by symmetrical location between substrate andreference plane of case.6.2.7 Transfer and Lift Method for Packing Boxes6.2.7.1 It is expected that not only boxes containingglass substrates but also empty boxes are fairly heavy.At least, they probably cannot be carried by hand.Therefore, it is assumed that whether the box containsglass substrates or not and whether the box is in aregular room or a clean room, it shall be lifted by aforklift and transferred mechanically. To accommodatea mechanical transfer and lift, skids must be installed atthe bottom of the box so that the forklift can insert itstongues underneath the box (see Figure 5). The heightof the skids shall be standardized for each shipping casesupplier, but not exceed 150 mm.6.2.7.2 Assuming lifting of the box and short distance,transfer is done using a balancer; the packing box is required to have handles, as shown in Figure 12, on thesides of the box. The structure of the handles shall bedesigned in such a way that it does not hinder thereference plane.6.2.8 Packing Box Strength6.2.8.1 The weight of the contents of the box, with theprescribed number of substrates, can be calculated fromthe density of substrates. The packing box has to bestrong enough to bear that weight. Moreover, it has tobe strong enough to hold another full box on top ofitself.6.2.8.2 Stacking three boxes with glass substrates isprohibited. Therefore there is no need for the packingbox strength to hold two boxes on top of one box.However, empty boxes may be stacked three high, butthe box has to be designed to bear the weight of twoempty boxes.6.2.8.3 The handles shall be strong enough to hold theweight when the box is filled with glass substrates aswell as a full box on top or two empty boxes on top.6.2.9 Packing Box Material6.2.9.1 Packing box material is not covered in thisdocument. Neither carcinogen nor de-gasification iscovered. For the purpose of cleaning, cleanliness, andparticle reduction, the material of the box has to bewashable and solvent-resistant. The addition of drainingholes is acceptable. Material must meet cleanliness,mechanical strength, and durability in line withspecifications of this document. h Long Edge2 Edge Support W L 4 Edge Support h4 W L Figure 1Sag

A1-1 Truck Platform DimensionsNOTE: This data only applies in Japan.Reference: JIS D4002 Internal Dimensions for RearBody of Motor Trucks A1-1.1 Dimensions  The platform inner dimensionsare categorized by width and length and listed in thetable below. These dimensions shall be selected on thebasis of their feasibility with regard to the functions ofthe chassis and the shape, use and special equipment ofthe platform. The dimensions represent the minimumdimensions for each category.Table A1-1 Platform Inner Dimensions (mm)Width Symbol A BCate-goryOrdinary Platform 2340 2120 Van Body 2370 21509600900084007800Length Category 720066006000540048004200 720066006000540048004200Note 5-12 tons 4 ton wide5-6 ton narrow A1-1.2 Dimension Naming  Naming of the innerdimensions of the platform is accomplished by usingthe type (either Ordinary Platform or Van Body), thesymbol for the width category and the length categoryin meters. Example:Ordinary A  8. 4Van B - 6. 6Length CategoryWidth CategoryVan Body At present, it seems that generally 10 ton-class trucksuse A, and 4 ton trucks use B. The followinginformation was gathered from one transport company:10 Ton  W=2330 L=9560 H=22804 Ton  W=2100 L=6700 H=2300(Unit = mm)Measurements may differ depending on themanufacturer and model.A1-2 Shipping ModelA1-2.1 The shipping model (Figure A1-15) shows thestoring of fourth generation flat panel display glasssubstrates in the packing box as described in thisspecification, a glass substrate manufacturer trans-porting substrates to a user, and the user returning thebox.A1-2.2 For covering the outside of the packing box, aplastic bag over the top is recommended. If thecontamination of the bottom part of the box is aconcern, prevention is not limited. In any case, the goalof this shipping model is to make it as simple aspossible and to reduce the cost and investment.

SEMI D26-1000 © SEMI 20001 SEMI D26-1000PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION FOR LARGE AREA MASKS FOR FLATPANEL DISPLAYS (NORTH AMERICA) This specification was technically approved by the Global Flat Panel Display Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Flat Panel Display Committee. Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on July 14, 2000. Initially available on SEMI OnLine August2000; to be published October 2000. 1 Purpose1.1 This specification establishes a set of standards toassist in specifying and ordering large area masks forthe Flat Panel Display industry. A major objective is toimprove the cycle time, order process efficiency andreduce the overall cost of manufacturing for both themask maker and the customer.1.2 This specification is intended f or use in NorthAmerica as an emerging market. However, theapplicability of this specification is not restricted orlimited to this region alone. This standard wasdeveloped to address a North American need for acommon set of requirements for specifying,manufacturing, and ordering large area masks. 2 Scope2.1 The following areas are covere d by this document:2.1.1 Registration and Accuracy2.1.2 Critical Dimensions2.1.3 Centrality2.1.4 Pellicles2.1.5 Edge Length and Thickness2.1.6 Symbology2.1.7 Data Formats2.1.8 Auto Inspection Artifacts2.1.9 Product Labeling2.2 This specification is being issu ed so that theindustry may evaluate the concept covered before itsadoption as a full standard. It is expected that initialapplication will occur mostly in North America,however, nothing in this standard limits its use to thismarket region.2.3 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of these standards to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 The document does not seek to be comprehensive.Instead, the areas listed are meant to help move thecurrent industry towards an agreed upon set ofstandards that are useful in reducing the overall cost ofsupplying masks for use by FPD manufacturers.

Substrate materials shall conform to thermalexpansion and optical transmittance characteristicsspecified in SEMI P1. Selected physical properties ofHTE, MTE, LTE, and ULTE materials are provided forinformation in SEMI P1.7.2 Overlay  Overlay refers to a lignment of theprinted pattern of one mask to another of the same set.Overlay error shall not exceed ± 6.0 m for soda limeplates and ± 2.0 m for quartz plates when plate temperature is maintained within ± 1°C. Alignment orregistration marks per SEMI P6 may be used tofacilitate measurements.7.3 Positional Accuracy  Relatio n between actualand desired locations of a printed feature on a glasssubstrate. This is a tolerance to be agreed upon by theend user and mask designer. The following guidelinesshould be used, with measurements being taken in atemperature and humidity controlled environment: ± 0.0157 m/mm/ °C for soda lime masks ± 0.00394 m/mm/ °C for quartz masksDimensioning from a central reference point shall beused. 7.4 Critical Dimensions (CD)  T he gauging ormeasurement process is fundamental to manufacturingof masks. The purpose of this section is to definestandard CD patterns to provide consistent evaluationand testing of micropatterning equipment, metrologyinstruments and processes used in large area maskphotomask manufacturing.7.4.1 Figures 1 and 2 are intended to illustrate theproper layout of each pattern cell and to defineappropriate design elements used within each basic cell.The user will determine all appropriate dimensions forthe feature as they apply to specific processing/equipment situations.7.4.2 L-bar cell (see Figure 1)  Th e L-bar cell isdesigned to be a measurement site for isolated featuresas well as line and space groups in orthogonal axes. Thebasic cell consists of one or more groups of nested L-shaped lines at a specific pitch. The pitch is defined astwice the nominal feature width. The center L-bar ofeach group shall extend beyond the ends of the other L-bars by at least 10m. This implies that the number ofbars is odd.7.4.3 Contact array cell (see Figure 2)  The contactarray cell is designed to provide resolution and proxim-ity effect information over a wide range of contactsizes. The design elements will consist of a 5  5 con-tact array and an isolated contact. The 5  5 array willproduce the maximal proximity for the center contact.7.4.4 A label to indicate the nomina l feature widthmust be placed near each basic cell. The labels must beof a clearly printable size. The details of the patterncells, such as the orientation, magnitude, range of linewidths and polarity of tone (clearfield vs. darkfield)shall be defined by the user.7.4.4.1 The target CD should closely r epresent the sizeof the most critical feature in the end users process, notnecessarily the minimum feature. A reasonabletolerance is ± 10% of the target CD.

SEMI D26-1000 © SEMI 20009 7.8.5 Design Rules  A comprehen sive and well-presented set of design rules is an invaluablecommunication tool between the customer and supplier.For the manufacture of large area precision glass andquartz substrate photomasks having geometrys in thelow to sub-micron range, design rules are an essentialcomponent of any successful program designed tominimize the risks of introducing errors and delays intothe process.7.8.5.1 The best match occurs when th ere is acommonality between the customers designcapabilities and vendors requirements.7.8.5.2 Design rule documents are usu ally unique toeach Large Area Mask supplier, and the details dependmainly upon the vendors software repertoire and theirability to process certain types of data.7.8.5.3 The type of Computer Aided D esign softwarepackage used by the customer to design their productmust be capable of either exporting data in a format thatthe vendor can readily use, or the vendor must becapable of using data in the native format of thecustomers design package. 8 Test Methods8.1 Auto Inspection Artifacts  T o perform anyautomated inspection of a photomask, the inspectionequipment and photomask pattern must be preciselylocated. This is done with four alignment targets on thephotomask. The alignment targets are part of thephotomask pattern and are located near each corner ofthe photomask. The target in the upper left corner willalso have a 200 micron border around it with a 10micron space between the target and the border. Whenappropriate, this additional border will also be used as aclosure test by exposing the targets first and then theborder at the end of the plate exposure.8.1.1 4 Alignment targets provide op timum alignmentaccuracy.8.1.2 Greater distance between the t argets providesgreater alignment accuracy.8.1.3 The target locations near the e dge of the glassprovide the maximum product image area.8.1.4 The target pattern can be easily located visuallyon the photomask.8.1.5 The target can be clear on dark or dark on clear. 9 Product Labeling9.1 General  Large Area Masks used in FPDmanufacturing are valuable, fragile and prone tocontamination prior to use. The content of a LAM is difficult to discern unless each unit contains a uniqueID that can be read by various tools. To simplifyAMHS and process/metrology tool operations, this IDneeds to be consistently readable on the bare mask, withand without resist coating; ideally it would be readablethrough the plastic container in which the mask isshipped. See Figures 710.9.2 Summary  The labeling spec ified herein consistsof a rectangular two-dimensional (2-D), machine-readable, binary Data Matrix symbology located on thepattern surface of LAMs, within the edge region andnear the orientation corner. The specification defines a46-character default message that is included in allmark fields, and option for up to 26 additionalcharacters, for a total of 72 message characters (seeSEMI T8).9.3 Field Construction  While t his specificationdoes not specify the marking techniques that may beemployed when complying with its requirements, it isassumed the symbol may be obtained throughlithographic techniques, for instance during the maskexposure sequence.9.4 Shape and Size of the Data Ma trix Code Symbol9.4.1 Data Matrix Code Symbol Dim ensions9.4.1.1 Each rectangular matrix code s ymbol shall becomposed of an array of 16 rows and 36 or 48 columnsas defined in AIM International SymbologySpecification  Data Matrix. It may contain analignment bar.9.4.1.2 Cell spacing shall be 25 m, c enter to center.9.4.1.3 Matrix code symbol nominal d imensions are:a. 4  9 mm, for a 16 row  36 column field, orb. 4  12 mm, for a 16 row  48 column field.9.4.2 Dot Size  The nominal shape of the dotproduced in the matrix may be circular or square. Itsdiameter or edge length shall be 250 ± 10 m.9.4.3 Border Rows and Columns (se e Figure 9)9.4.3.1 One border row and one borde r column shallcontain a dot in each cell. There are identified as theprimary border row and the primary border column.These are used by the code reader to determine theorientation of the matrix.9.4.3.2 The opposing (secondary) bord er row andcolumn shall contain dots in alternating cells.9.4.3.3 For these rectangular matrix co de symbols, thereference point of the symbol shall be the physicalcenter point of the cell common to the primary borderrow and the primary border column.
