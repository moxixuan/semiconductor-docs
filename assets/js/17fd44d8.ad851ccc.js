The DATA part contained in JIG ID shall beused for such supplemental information as notes of the requirements, conditions and history of the JIG. Thespecification of the DATA part is as below.7.1.2.2 Number of Digits  Although the number of digits of the DATA part is not stipulated in particular, thenumber shall be the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose abovementioned. The following example may helpunderstanding: Even though there is a case where approximately. 256 byte letters are used for the primary memoryto describe the number of shots and the history of errors, the limitation on the number of digits for the DATA partdepends on the amount of memory held by the RFID tag.7.1.2.3 Attribute  Information on the DATA part shall be represented in Visible ASCII Characters (2016 -7E16).7.1.2.4 Information Alteration  No considerations are given to whether or not information on the DATA part isavailable for alteration.
