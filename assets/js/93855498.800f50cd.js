The   evaluator   should   also\nreview  any  assessment  of  the  material,  component,  or\nequipment   as   a   whole   by   an   accredited   testing\nlaboratory.\n6. 1.3    The  risk  assessment  should  include  both  normal\noperation  and  the  consequence  of  reasonably  foresee-\nable,  single-point  failures  within  the  equipment.    It\nshould  not  include  exposure  to  fire  or  external  ignition\nsources not within the intended use environment.\n6. 1.4  Certifications  by  an  accredited  testing  laboratory\nof  materials,  components,  or  the  equipment  as  a  whole\nmay be used in the fire risk assessment. However, such\ncertifications   are   valid   only   to   the   extent   that   the\nconditions  of  use  for  the  certification  correlate  to  the\nconditions  of  use  for  the  equipment  whose  fire  risk  is\nbeing assessed.\nNOTE 9:  For  example,  a  personal  computer  certified  to  IEC\n60950  might  be  incorporated  into  equipment  for  use  as  a\ncontroller.  The  material  flammability  requirements  of  IEC\n60950  may  or  may  not  be  sufficient  for  this  use  of  the\npersonal  computer,  depending  upon  its  exposure  to  oxidizers\nand  external  sources  of  ignition  when  incorporated  into  the\nequipment.      Also,   the   levels   of   smoke   tolerable   in   the\nenvironment   for   which   a   general   industry   standard   was\nwritten    may    exceed    those    tolerable    in    semiconductor\nmanufacturing  cleanrooms.    Furthermore,  if  the  equipment  is"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S14-0704 \xa9 SEMI 2000, 2004 4\nintended to be used in a potentially explosive atmosphere, the\ncertification  to  IEC  60950  would  not  sufficiently  control  its\nrisk of being a source of ignition.\n6. 1.5    The  consequences  and  the  probability  of  fire\nfrom  each  identified  hazard  should  be  assessed  and\nrated,  as  described  in  SEMI  S10.  See  Appendix  1  for\nthe   criteria   used   for   the   assignments   of   Severity,\nLikelihood and Risk in this document.\n6. 1.5.1      The   assigned   Severity   and   Likelihood   and\nresulting  Risk  category  should  be  recorded  as  part  of\nthe analysis.\n6. 1.5.2    For  those  hazards  for  which  the  Risk  depends\non   the   conditions   of   use   or   use   environment,   the\nequipment  supplier  should  make  and  state  appropriate\nassumptions.    If  the  equipment  supplier  is  unable  to\nmake  appropriate  assumptions  as  to  the  Likelihood\nbecause  it  depends  predominantly  on  factors  in  the\nusers'    sole    control    (e.g.,    adherence    to    specified\nprocedures),  the  supplier  should  state  that  and  provide\nan estimate of the Severity.\nNOTE 10:  The   facilities   requirements   on   which   the   risk\nassessment  depends  are  to  be  specified  by  the  equipment\nsupplier.\n6. 1.6  For fire to occur, there must be a fuel, an oxidizer\nand  a  source  of  ignition.    Elimination  of  any  of  these\nfactors   eliminates   the   risk   of   fire.      Similarly,   the\nSeverity,  Likelihood  and  Risk  of  a  fire  can  be  reduced\nby    reducing    one    or    more    of    these    elements\nappropriately.\n6. 1.7    It  is  important  to  remember  that  there  are  often\nimplicit   oxidizers   (e.g.,   room   air)   and   sources   of\nignition   (e.g.,   room   temperature   for   a   pyrophoric\nmaterial).\n6. 1.8      The   fire   risk   assessment   should   include   the\njudgement  of  a  qualified  (as  described  in  SEMI  S7)\nparty to determine the level of detail of the assessment.\nThat  party  may  group  similar  hazards  for  assessment\nand reporting.\nNOTE  11:    Such  grouping  could  include,  for  example,  all  of\nthe knobs and buttons of similar materials into one group, the\nheated  surfaces  into  a  second,  and  the  several  flammable\nliquids with similar properties into a third.\n6. 2  Fuels\n6. 2.1      Fuels   include   all   those   materials   capable   of\nreacting with an oxidizer in a fire.  The risks of both the\nmaterials of which the equipment is constructed and the\nprocess chemicals used in it should be assessed.\n6. 2.2  Materials of Construction\n6. 2.2.1    The  risk  assessment  should  include  all  of  the\nmaterials   of   construction,   regardless   of   quantity   or\napplication.\nNOTE 12:  This includes small parts,  such as knobs, buttons,\nelectrical  contactors,  terminal  strips,  circuit  boards,  signal\nwire and power wiring as well as large components, modules\n(such as mini-environments) and subassemblies.\nNOTE  13:    Some  of  the  smallest  components  can  create  a\nhigh   risk,   as   in   the   potential   for   ignition   by   adiabatic\ncompression  of  fluoropolymer  seats  in  high  pressure  oxygen\nvalves.\nNOTE  14:    The  assessment  can  be  simplified  by  grouping\nsimilar  items  together.  Example  1:  wiring  that  has  the  same\ntype  of  insulation.  Example  2:  knobs,  switches,  handles  and\nlatches made from similar polymers. Identified groups should\ninclude their approximate total mass.\n6. 2.2.2      In   assessing   the   risk,   the   evaluator   should\nconsider:\n\u2022 the size of each component,\n\u2022 the   total   quantity   and   distribution   of   similar\ncomponents,\n\u2022 the  inherent  properties  of  the  material,  such  as\nignitability,  flame  spread,  heat  of  combustion,  and\nbyproducts   (See   Appendix   2   for   guidance   on\nevaluation of these properties.),\n\u2022 the exposure to oxidizers, and\n\u2022 the exposure to ignition sources.\nNOTE  15:    The  specification  control  of  materials  used  in\napproved  electrical  components  should  also  be  considered.\nApprovals may allow for substitution of many materials with\nequivalent flammability ratings.\nNOTE 16:  The  inherent  properties  of  materials  affect  two\ntypes  of  risk  within  the  equipment:  flame  spread  risk  and\ncontamination  risk  (i.e.,  smoke  damage  from  combustion\nbyproducts).    In    the    case    of    electrical    and    electronic\ncomponents   used   in   assemblies   and   equipment   that   are\nconstructed and used in accordance with applicable standards\n(e.g.,  IEC  61010-1,  IEC  60204-1),  flame  spread  risk  may  be\nadequately    controlled    by    the    standard,    and    detailed\nassessment of the material properties of such components that\naffect  flame  spread  may  not  be  warranted.    However,  a\nsignificant   contamination   risk   could   still   remain   (e.g.,   a\nstandard may allow a component mounted on a printed circuit\nboard to fail and burn, as long as the burning remains local to\nthe printed circuit board) and warrant a detailed assessment of\nrelated  material  properties  of  the  components.  The  level  of\ndetail   of   the   assessment   may   also   be   affected   by   the\nmitigation method chosen (see Section 7).\n6. 2.3  Process Chemicals\n6. 2.3.1      This   portion   of   the   risk   assessment   should\ninclude all of the process chemicals expected (based on\nthe   equipment   supplier's   recommended   or   baseline\nprocesses)  to  be  used  in  the  equipment.    It  should  also\ninclude flammable and combustible wastes generated or\ncollected   within   the   equipment   and   fluids   in   the\nequipment  which  are  required  for  its  operation  but"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S14-0704 \xa9 SEMI 2000, 2004 5\nwhich do not participate chemically in the process (e.g.,\nvacuum pump oil).\n6. 2.3.2      In   assessing   the   risk,   the   evaluator   should\nconsider:\n\u2022 the  quantity,  concentration,  state,  temperature,  and\npressure of each chemical in each container,\n\u2022 for  those  chemicals  supplied  automatically  by  the\nfacility,   the   available   flow,   pressure,   and   total\nquantity,\n\u2022 the  aggregate  supplies  and  distribution  of  similar\nchemicals,\n\u2022 the  inherent  properties  of  the  chemicals,  such  as\nflammable     limits,     flash     point,     autoignition\ntemperature,  heat  of  combustion,  and  the  products\nof combustion and decomposition (see the Material\nSafety  Data  Sheets  for  guidance  on  evaluation  of\nthese properties),\n\u2022 the exposure to oxidizers, and\n\u2022 the exposure to ignition sources.\nNOTE 17:  Chemicals  with  similar  fire  properties  may  be\nconsidered together for the purpose of this assessment.\n6. 3  Sources of Ignition\n6. 3.1    Sources  of  ignition  can  be  broadly  divided  into\nthose within the equipment and those external to it.\n6. 3.2  Internal Sources\n6. 3.2.1  Potential electrical ignition sources:\n\u2022 devices  or  conditions  that  in  normal  operation  can\ngenerate   ignition   energy   (e.g.,   heaters,   static\nelectricity, lasers);\n\u2022 devices or conditions that in reasonably foreseeable\nassembly, use and/or wear conditions can generate\nignition  energy  (e.g.,  power  connectors,  terminal\nstrips);\n\u2022 devices  that  in  reasonably  foreseeable  single  point\nfailure  modes  can  generate  ignition  energy  (e.g.,\ntransformers, electronic components); and\n\u2022 short circuits.\n6. 3.2.2  Potential chemical ignition sources:\n\u2022 exothermic process chemical reactions,\n\u2022 exothermic  reactions  from  inadvertent  mixing  of\nprocess chemicals,\n\u2022 exothermic  reactions  between  process  chemicals\nand materials of construction, and\n\u2022 release   of   pyrophoric   or   air-reactive   chemicals\nfrom processing or maintenance.\n6. 3.2.3  Sudden changes in process conditions:\n\u2022 rapid  (sometimes  called  \u201cadiabatic\u201d)  compression\nof gas mixtures, and\n\u2022 rapid increases in temperature.\n6. 3.2.4  Mechanical friction\n6. 3.3  External Sources\n6. 3.3.1  External sources include expected and foreseen\nconditions of the equipment\u2019s use.  As these are factors\nnormally outside the control of the equipment supplier,\ntheir  risks  are  difficult  to  assess.    They  are  outside  the\nscope of this document.\n6. 4  Oxidizers\n6. 4.1      The   most   common   oxidizer   is   air,   which   is\npresent    within    and    around    most    semiconductor\nmanufacturing  equipment.    Unless  specific  measures\nare  taken  to  exclude  air  (e.g.,  inert  pressurizing  of  an\nelectrical   enclosure),   it   should   be   assumed   to   be\navailable in infinite supply.\n6. 4.2    It  is  possible  that  some  materials  of  construction\nwill   act   as   oxidizers   or   will   yield   oxidizers   when\nsubjected to heat.\n6. 4.3  Several common process chemicals (e.g., oxygen\nand  hydrogen  peroxide)  are  oxidizers.    Their  risks\nshould be assessed in a manner similar to that described\nabove for process chemicals that are fuels.\n6. 5  Reporting\n6. 5.1    Although  these  guidelines  are  intended  for  use\nthroughout  the  design  and  development  process,  it  is\nnot  the  intent  of  these  guidelines  that  the  equipment\nsupplier  should  make  all  of  the  information  recorded\nduring  the  development  of  the  equipment  available  to\nothers.    The  equipment  supplier  should  document  the\nfire  risk  assessment  and  mitigation  in  three  forms:\ninternal records, a final fire risk assessment report, and\na summary report.\n6. 5.2        Relevant    analyses,    assessments,    and    design\ndecisions   should   be   documented   in   the   equipment\nsupplier's  internal  records.    These  records  need  not,\nhowever, be made available to other parties.\n6. 5.3  Final Fire Risk Assessment Report\n6. 5.3.1    This  report  should  contain  an  itemized  list  of\nthe   residual   risks   identified   in   reviewing   the   final\ndesign, considering the risks described in the preceding\nsubsections  or  otherwise  known  or  foreseen  by  the\nevaluator.

It describes ways in which\nthe equipment and its use can be designed to minimize\nthe risks.\nNOTE  20:    The  description  of  a  mitigation  technique  in  this\nsection is not intended to imply that such technique should be\nused  for  each  system.    Therefore,  the  decision  to  include  a\nparticular   mitigation   technique   should   be   based   on   the\nassessed risk.\nNOTE 21:  Fire  detection  and suppression  are  also  means  of\nmitigating   fire   risk.   The   criteria   for   fire   detection   and\nsuppression systems are in SEMI S2.\n7. 1.2      In   mitigating   risks,   the   general   hierarchy   of\nelimination,     engineering     controls,     administrative\ncontrols,   warning   and   work   practices   should   be\nfollowed.    Following  this  hierarchy  comprises  using\ntechniques  which  are  highest  in  it  if  several  techniques\nare  equally  applicable.    Design  and  use  constraints,  as\nwell   as   relative   cost,   however,   may   justify   using\ntechniques from generally less preferable categories.  In\nany  case,  the  residual  risk  should  be  assessed  and\nreported.\n7. 2  Fuels\n7. 2.1  Materials of Construction\n7. 2.1.1  The lowest fire risk is posed by noncombustible\nmaterials  of  construction.    Available  noncombustible\nmaterials  are  not,  however,  suitable  or  desirable  for  all\napplications     within     semiconductor     manufacturing\nequipment.\nNOTE  22:    The  properties  necessary  to  perform  the  intended\nfunction  of  system  components  and  the  properties  necessary\nto satisfy component-level standards may also restrict the use\nof noncombustible materials.\n7. 2.1.2      When   materials   which   are   combustible   are\nchosen, the fire risk may be mitigated by:\n\u2022 selecting  those  materials  with  the  least  undesirable\nproperties as described above; and\n\u2022 minimizing  the  total  mass  and  distribution  of  such\nmaterials.\n7. 2.2  Process Chemicals\n7. 2.2.1    It  may  be  possible  to  reduce  the  fire  risk  by\nchanging  the  quantities  and  species  of  the  chemicals\nused in the intended processes.\n7. 2.3      The   fire   risks   of   combustible   materials   of\nconstruction  and  flammable  and  combustible  process\nchemicals may also be reduced by limiting those factors\ndescribed in Section 6.\n7. 3  Sources of Ignition\n7. 3.1  Potential sources of ignition should be considered\nin  conjunction  with  the  fuels  and  oxidizers  they  might\nignite.\n7. 3.2  Risks due to sources of ignition can be mitigated\nby:\n\u2022 limiting their number,"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S14-0704 \xa9 SEMI 2000, 2004 7\n\u2022 limiting their energy, and\n\u2022 separating   them   from   combustible   materials   of\nconstruction  and  from  flammable  and  combustible\nprocess chemicals.

This\nrelated information was approved for publication by 2/3 committee vote on July 17, 2003.\nR2-1  Introduction\nR2-1.1  Semiconductor   cleanrooms   are   operationally\nsensitive  to  products  of  a  fire.    A  fire  will  result  in\nsmoke   and   corrosive   particle   contamination   to   the\ncleanroom, process equipment, and work in process.  A\nproperly   designed,   installed,   and   maintained   smoke\ndetection    and    control    system    will    not    prevent\ncontamination,    but    will    limit    the    spread    and\nconcentration  of  the  contaminant.    The  basis  of  the\nsmoke control system design should be aligned with the\norganization\u2019s risk management objectives.\nR2-1.2      This   Related   Information   deals   with   smoke\nmanagement  systems  for  cleanrooms  themselves,  not\nfor equipment.  Smoke removal from a cleanroom may\nbe  performed  by  ventilation  systems  that  are  in  place\nfor  other  purposes  (e.g.,  process  exhaust  systems  of\nequipment)  or  by  equipment  designed  and  installed\nspecifically  to  remove  smoke  from  the  room.    These\nmay both be parts of the protection for a cleanroom and\nmay differ in how they are activated.\nR2-2  Actuation\nR2-2.1  Automatic actuation of dedicated smoke control\nsystems  is  preferable;  however,  many  facilities  prefer\nmanual activation.  If the system is manually activated,\nthe following should be done.\nR2-2.1.1      The   smoke   detection   system   should   be\nmonitored by qualified personnel 24 hours per day.\nR2-2.1.2    Emergency  response  teams  (ERT)  or  other\npersonnel   authorized   to   actuate   the   manual   smoke\ncontrol    system    should    be    capable    of    prompt\nnotification.\nR2-2.1.3              Detailed       smoke       control       emergency\nprocedures should be documented and practiced.  These\nprocedures  can  include  hazardous  gas  shutdowns  and\nshutdowns  of  appropriate  air  recirculation  fans  as  well\nas activating the smoke control exhaust fans.\nR2-2.2    A  secondary  means  of  manual  actuation  of  the\nsmoke/contaminant  control  system  should  be  provided\nin  a  clearly  marked  and  accessible  area  outside  the\ncleanroom.\nR2-3  Capacity\nR2-3.1    The  smoke  control  system  capacity  needed  is\ndirectly  related  to  the  design  fire  size  which  depends\nupon the type, amount and arrangement of combustible\nmaterials  in  the  cleanroom.    In  order  to  achieve  a\nsystem  that  is  economically  feasible,  the  maximum\ndesign  fire  size  should  be  limited  to  the  fire  size  at\nsprinkler    operation.        For    a    typical    cleanroom\nconfiguration,  the  fire  size  at  sprinkler  operation  is  in\nthe range of 600 to 800 kilowatts.\nR2-3.2        Smoke    removal    system    capacity    can    be\ndesigned based on an integrated system approach.  The\ntotal  capacity  can  include  the  fume  exhaust  system\ncapacity and dedicated smoke removal system capacity.\nR2-4  Design Considerations\nR2-4.1    When  the  fume  exhaust  system  is  used  for\nsmoke removal, the following design parameters should\nbe followed.\nR2-4.1.1  The fume exhaust system ductwork should be\nof    non-combustible    construction    or    should    be\nlisted/approved  for  smoke  removal  and  not  incorporate\nthe use of fire dampers or interrupters.\nR2-4.1.2    It  should  be  confirmed  that  sufficient  fume\nexhaust system intake points exist throughout the clean\nroom.      If   not,   additional   intake   points   should   be\nprovided  and  incorporate  the  use  of  normally  closed\ndampers.    These  dampers  should  be  opened  either\nautomatically   by   activation   of   the   smoke   detection\nsystem or by manual means.\nR2-4.1.3    When  the  fume  exhaust  system  is  used  for\nsmoke  removal,  it  can  incorporate  the  use  of  variable\nspeed  fan(s).    During  the  smoke  removal  mode,  fire\ndampers  on  supplemental  intake  points  will  open  and\nthe  fan  speed  will  be  increased.    The  design  capture\nvelocity at the tool(s) could be affected, and this should\nbe  reviewed.    Necessary  balancing  changes  should  be\nmade    to    ensure    the    design    capture    velocity    is\nmaintained.\nR2-4.2  The ventilation system make-up air fans should\nbe   sized   such   that   under   full   smoke   and   process\nexhaust,   the   fabrication   area   maintains   a   positive\npressure relative the adjacent areas."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S14-0704 \xa9 SEMI 2000, 2004 13\nR2-4.3      Smoke   removal   system   intake   locations   are\ndependent   on   the   fabrication   area   design.      Design\nalternatives  should  be  addressed  with  a  competent  fire\nprotection  engineering  design  firm.  For  example,  for\nopen   manufacturing   areas,   smoke   removal   system\nintake   sequencing   should   be   designed   such   that\nindividual    zones    can    be    activated    to    prevent\ncontaminant  migration  to  adjacent  clean  areas  of  the\nfab.

Further\ninformation   can   be   found   in   the   appropriate   fire\nprotection codes and standards applicable to the type of\nfire protection system and in related documents.\nNOTE   R3-1:   The   term   \u201cfire   suppression\u201d   is   limited   to\nextinguishing   fire,   once   it   has   begun.      The   term   \u201cfire\nprotection\u201d  incorporates  fire  suppression  and  other  means  of\nmitigating   the   risk   of   fires,   including   fire   detection   and\nmaterials selection.\nR3-1.3  The use of contractors with previous experience\nin  the  design  and  installation  of  fire  protection  of\ncleanrooms      and      semiconductor      manufacturing\nequipment is desirable.\nR3-1.4        Independent    third    party    review    of    fire\nprotection designs and installations by a fire protection\nengineer  with  relevant  experience  can  also  help  to\nensure that systems are correctly designed and installed.\nNOTE  R3-2:  The  material  in  this  Related  Information  is\npresented  as  additional  guidance  in  designing,  installing,  and\nmaintaining    fire    protection    systems    in    semiconductor\nmanufacturing   equipment.      Although   this   information   is\nbelieved to be useful in optimizing such systems, the material\nin  this  Related  Information  does  not  comprise  additional\ncriteria  for  determining  conformance  to  the  provisions  of\nSEMI S2 or SEMI S14.\nR3-2  Design Review\nR3-2.1    Ensure  that  system  proposed  uses  approved  or\nlisted  components  and  that  they  are  used  within  their\nlisting  or  approval,  e.g.,  FM  Approved  wet  bench  fire\nsuppression systems should be used for open faced wet\nbench  whereas  an  enclosed  tool  can  use  a  system\ncomprising of FM approved & compatible components.\nR3-2.2      Detection   needs   to   be   selected   to   suit   the\nworking environment and the type of fire/smoke that is\nanticipated.    For  example,  optical  detectors  need  to\nhave   been   tested   and   approved/listed   for   use   with\nspecific flammable liquids or gases. Flames and smoke\nfrom    burning    materials    have    varying    physical\ncharacteristics which mean that some detection devices\nwill not always react promptly.\nR3-2.3    The  location  of  detection  devices  in  relation  to\nhazards  needs  to  be  carefully  considered.    A  detector\nthat  is  located  too  close  to  a  heat  source  may  activate\nwhen  it  sees  normal  process  conditions  rather  than  fire\nconditions.\nR3-2.4  Some optical detectors may also be susceptible\nto  accidental  activation  if  they  are  exposed  to  welding\nflashes.    Care  in  detector  selection  can  avoid  this,  but\nimplementing   strict   cutting   and   welding   working\npractices  and  permissions  can  also  play  an  important\npart.\nR3-3  Installation Review\nR3-3.1  Once completed by the fire protection installer,\nthe  fire  protection  installation  should  be  inspected  and\nreviewed    by    a    competent    and    experienced    fire\nprotection engineer.

This  is\nimportant   to   protect   personnel   and   property   from\nmoving  pipes  in  high-pressure  systems  using  agents\nsuch as carbon dioxide.\nR3-3.4      Detection   systems   should   have   components\ninstalled  as  per  reviewed  drawings,  however  it  is  not\nalways   possible   during   desktop   drawing   review   to\nidentify  that  detectors  are  correctly  sited.

The\ntypes  of  problems  that  can  be  picked  up  by  functional\ntesting are:\nR3-4.2.1      Inability   of   detection   system   to   detect   as\nintended,\nR3-4.2.2  Inability of  control  system  to  receive  signal\nfrom individual detectors, and\nR3-4.2.3    Inability  of  alarm  panel  to  initiate  system\ndischarge  or  send  alarm  signals  to  connected  devices\nand safety systems, e.g.,\n\u2022 local or remote alarm panels,\n\u2022 sounders & warning devices, and\n\u2022 interlocks   to   equipment   shutdown   and   safety\nsystems, EMO.\nR3-4.3    Discharge  Testing  is  the  only  way  that  we  can\nensure   that   that   a   system   will   fulfill   its   intended\nfunction.

Accordingly, alternatives such as type testing\ncan  prove  that  the  design  will  provide  the  necessary\nprotection, but may need to be supplemented by a more\nrigorous  commissioning  test  of  the  final  systems.  Type\ntesting  would  involve  the  installation  and  discharge\ntesting of a system on a tool during manufacture or on a\nmock  up  of  the  tool.    The  aim  would  be  to  prove  that\ndistribution  pipework  and  nozzles  have  been  correctly\ndesigned   and   that   the   concentration   of   agents   and\ndistribution  patterns  from  nozzles  is  acceptable.      This\nwould  be  supplemented  by  additional  tests  on  each\ninstallation,  including  pressure  tests  of  pipework  and\n\u201cpuff\u201d tests to verify pipework integrity.\nR3-5  Burn In\nR3-5.1    In  order  to  avoid  unnecessary  discharges,  a\nperiod  of  burn-in  for  the  detection  system  is  advisable.\nThis  involves  the  detection  system  operating,  enabling\ndetection  of  fires  and  initiation  of  alarms,  but  the\ndetection  is  not  interlocked  to  shut  down  the  process\nequipment or initiate a discharge.\nR3-5.2    A  period  of  days  or  weeks  may  be  appropriate\ndepending  on  the  effect  of  an  accidental  activation  of\nthe   system   in   terms   of   interruption   to   processing,\ndamage     to     product     or     contamination     of     the\nenvironment.\nR3-6  Maintenance & Servicing\nR3-6.1  Once systems are installed and commissioned it\nis important that the routine inspection and maintenance\nprocedures  recommended  by  manufacturers  and  those\nrequired   by   codes   and   standards,   are   adequately\nimplemented.\nR3-6.2    The  inspection  frequencies  may  need  to  be\nmodified if the ambient conditions can adversely affect\nthe  protection  systems.

However  the  theory  of  explosion\nprevention   and   mitigation   transcends   jurisdictional\nboundaries. While this document arises out of the need\nfor  some  equipment  to  satisfy  the  European  Union\nATEX  Directive  (94/9/EC),  it  has  been  developed  in\nsuch  as  way  that  it  will  not  only  meet  the  requirement\nto   document   the   principles   of   integrated   explosion\nsafety  (Essential  Health  and  Safety  Requirement  1.0),\nbut   will   provide   information   to   authorities   having\njurisdiction (AHJs) in many other parts of the world.\nR4-2  Documentation\nR4-2.1    For  all  equipment  using  flammable  liquids  or\ngases  an  Explosion  Risk  Document  (ERD)  should  be\ndeveloped  and  issued  as  an  appendix  to  the  SEMI  S14\nFire   Risk   Assessment   Internal   Report.

SiO\n2\nparticles  entering  the  chamber  create  a\nsignal  that  is  calibrated  to  represent  the  presence  of  a\nknown concentration of the target gas.  A gas detection\nsystem  using  this  method  is  typically  used  in  a  sample\ndraw  system  and  can  be  used  either  by  itself  or  in\nconjunction with a pyrolyzer to condition (burn) the gas\nentering the detection head.\n7. 8  Molecular Emission Spectrom eter \u2014 Sample air is\ninjected   into   a   reaction   chamber.      In   the   reaction\nchamber,  a  flame,  fed  by  hydrogen  and  sample  air,  is\nthe  activating  reaction.    When  a  sample  gas  enters  the\nflame,  reactions  of  the  target  gas  result  in  additional\nlight emissions.  The resulting light passes through two\noptical filters and is converted to electronic signals in a\ndual photomultiplier tube.  The signals are combined to\nproduce a linear, quantitative output.\n7. 9  Paper  Tape  \u2014  Paper  tape  syst ems  use  the  color\nchange of a chemically impregnated tape to detect toxic\ngases.    The  tape  changes  color  when  exposed  to  a\nchallenge  gas;  the  color  change  is  then  detected  by  a\nphotocell, analyzed, and converted into a concentration\nvalue (ppm or ppb).\n7. 10  Solid  State  \u2014  One  type  of  soli d  state  sensor  is\nmade of a metal oxide (typically tin-oxide) material that\nchanges resistance in response to the presence of a toxic\ngas;  the  gas  detection  system  measures  this  resistance\nchange and converts it into a concentration value.  Thin\nfilm  semiconductor  sensors  absorb  the  target  gas  onto\nthe  semiconductor,  resulting  in  a  transfer  of  electrons\nwhich causes a measured change in the resistance of the\nsemiconductor    and    reported    as    a    ppm    or    ppb\nconcentration.\n8  Related Documents\n8. 1  SEMI Documents\nSEMI   S2   \u2014   Environmental,   Health,   and   Safety\nGuideline for Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment\n8. 2   American  Conference  of  Gove rnmental  Industrial\nHygienists  (ACGIH)\n1\n\u2014  Threshold  Limit  Values  for\nChemical Substances in the Work Environment\n8. 3  Uniform Fire Code\n2\nUFC Article 51 \u2014 Semiconductor Fabrication Facilities\nUFC Article 80 \u2014 Hazardous Materials\n8. 4  National Fire Protection Asso ciation\n3\nNFPA 49 \u2014 Hazardous Chemical Data\nNFPA 70 \u2014 National Electric Code\nNFPA 72 \u2014 National Fire Alarm Code\nNFPA 318 \u2014 Protection of Cleanrooms\n8. 5  International Fire Code\n4\n8. 6    Santa   Clara,   California   Unifor m   Fire   Code,\n5\nAmendments 1998 Edition\n8. 7  Southern Building Code Cong ress International\n6\nStandard  Building  Code  \u2014  Chapter  22:  Hazardous\nMaterials, 1994 Edition"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"1   American   Conference   of   Governmental   Industrial   Hygienists\n(ACGIH),  1330  Kemper  Meadows  Drive,  Cincinnati,  OH    45240-\n1634\n2  Published  by  International  Conference  of  Building  Officials  and\nWestern  Fire  Chiefs  Association,  5360  South  Workman  Mill  Road,\nWhitter, CA  90601\n3 National Fire Protection Association, 1 Batterymarch Park, Quincy,\nMA  02269\n4  International  Fire  Code  Institute,  9300  Jollyville  Road,  Suite  105,\nAustin, TX  78759\n5  Santa  Clara  Fire  Department,  777  Benton  Street,  Santa  Clara,  CA\n95050\n6  Southern  Building  Code  Congress  International  (SBCCI),  900\nMontclair Road, Birmingham, AL  35213"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S15-0200 \xa9 SEMI 20006\n8. 8  US Government\nOccupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA)\n7\n29 CFR - Sections 1910.119 and 1910.1000\nUS  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)\n8\n40  CFR\n68. 13, Subpart C"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"7 US Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.  20402\n8 Superintendent of Documents, US Government Printing Office,\nWashington, D.C.  20402"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S15-0200 \xa9 SEMI 20007\nAPPENDIX 1\nTABLE FOR COMPARISON OF PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS\nNOTE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  S15  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot  procedures  on\nDecember 15, 1999 by the North American Regional Standards Committee.\nTable A1-1\nPerformanceManufacturer/Technology\nCharacteristicsA.B.C.DE.\nAccuracy\nAlarms\nCalibration\nCertifications and\nClassifications\nCommunications (Serial)\nConditioning\nRequirements\nCost of Ownership\nData Archiving\nDiagnostics\nDisplay\nDrift\nEnvironmental\nConditions\nEquipment Failure\nExpansion Flexibility\nExtractive Systems:\nSampling Distance\nSample Cycle Time\nSample Contamination\nFilter Lag\nInstallation (Wiring\nConfiguration)\nIsolation\nLimits of Detection:\nLowest Alarm Level\nLimit of Detection\nUpper limit of Detection\nLinearity\nMaintenance Interval\nOther Utilities\nOutputs\nPhysical Size\nPoisoning\nPosition Effect\n(Attitude Sensitivity)\nPower Outage\nPower Requirements\nRecovery Time\nRepeatability"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S15-0200 \xa9 SEMI 20008\nPerformanceManufacturer/Technology\nCharacteristicsA.B.C.DE.\nReliability\nReplacement/\nReplenishment\nResolution\nResponse Time\nRFI/EMI Susceptibility\nSelf-test\nSensor Exchange\nSensor Specificity\nService and Support\nSpare Parts Availability\nSpecial Handling\nConsiderations\nStorage and Shelf-life\nRequirements\nSystem Check\nSystem Flexibility\nWake Up Requirements\nWarm Up Period\nWarranty\nNOTICE:  SEMI  makes  no  warranties  or  representations  as  to  the  suitability  of  the  guidelines  set  forth  herein  for\nany  particular  application.
