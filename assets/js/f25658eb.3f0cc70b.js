Required  directional  changes  should  be\naccomplished     by     butt-weld     elbows     or     block\ncomponents.  Tube  bends  may  be  used  on  tubing  \u2264  \u2126\ninch  O.D.  and  should  be  formed  using  manual  or  CNC\nbending  equipment.  CNC  tube  bending  is  preferred  to\nmanual  tube  bending  because  during  manual  bending\nuniform  deformation  of  the  tubing  is  more  difficult  to\ncontrol and reproducibility of bend geometries is much\nless than that achieved by bending using CNC methods.\nAn internal mandrel must not be used during bending as\nit  can  contaminate  and/or  damage  the  internal  surface.\nRecommended minimum bend radii are the following:\n\u2022 For  inert  gas  lines,  a  bend  radius  (as  measured\nfrom  the  tube  centerline)  as  small  as  2  \u25ca  tube\ndiameter  may  be  used  for  90  degree  directional\nchanges.\n\u2022 For  reactive  gas  lines,  a  bend  radius  (as  measured\nfrom  the  tube  centerline)  as  small  as  5x  tube\ndiameter  may  be  used  for  90  degree  directional\nchanges;    however,    it    is    recommended    that\ncorrosion testing be performed  to determine if bent\ntubing  is  suitable  in  each  particular  reactive  gas\napplication.\n5. 3      Components   that   may   need   to   be   removed   or\nreplaced should be installed with metal seal fittings.\n5. 4    Dead  volumes  should  be  minimized  in  the  process\ngas  stream.  The  system  internal  volume  should  be\nminimized.\n5. 5    All  potentially  pyrophoric  or  reactive  gases  should\nhave     upstream     and     downstream     purge/vacuum\ncapability  for  MFC  maintenance.  To  speed  the  purge\nprocess  and  allow  the  system  to  be  evacuated  even  if\nthe  MFC  is  clogged,  the  design  should  also  have  the\nability    to    provide    vacuum    both    upstream    and\ndownstream of the MFC. A gas is defined to be reactive\nif it has a Hazardous Production Material (HPM) rating\nof 3 or 4 per SEMI S2.\n5. 6  Inert gases do not need an input for an independent\npurge  gas.    Inert  gases  can  act  as  their  own  purge  gas\nand  only  need  to  purge  in  the  intended  direction  of\nflow.    Inert  gas  lines  do  not  need  upstream  vacuum\ncapability  or  downstream  purge  capability.    To  speed\nthe purge process, the design should have the ability to\nprovide vacuum downstream of the MFC.\n5. 7  For low pressure equipment, the vacuum path from\nthe  MFC  manifold  to  the  pump  should  bypass  the\nprocess  chamber  during  purging  or  maintenance  and\nshould connect directly to the foreline.\n5. 8    For  atmospheric  pressure  equipment,  a  vacuum\nVenturi  to  vent/exhaust  method  should  be  required  for\nreactive gases.\n5. 9    Design  should  include  a  means  of  cycle  purging\nupstream and downstream of removable components or\nsubassemblies  for  reactive  gases  and  should  include  a\nmeans   of   flow-through   purging   for   all   removable\ncomponents.\n5. 10      Backflow/back   pressure   protection   should   be\nincluded for all purge gases in the system.\n5. 11  All incoming gas lines should have filters.\n5. 12      Any  additional  filters,  located  at  point  of  use\nbefore  a  process  chamber  or  loadlock,  should  have  a\nmeans of isolation from atmosphere.\n5. 13      Test/sample   ports   should   be   located   on   each\nprocess    chamber    supply    line    or    the    designated\npurge/vent line.\n5. 14    For  processes  requiring  additional  purification  of\nprocess  gases,  purifiers  should  be  included  in  the  gas\nsystem  and  located  upstream  of  MFC\xeds.  The  system\nshould   include   a   means   of   purging   and   removing\npurifiers in a safe manner.\n6  Materials Guidelines\n6. 1  Stainless Steel\n6. 1.1          Components     should     be     fabricated     from\nelectropolished  316L  stainless  steel  per  SEMI  F17,  or\nSEMI F20.\n6. 2  Other Materials\n6. 2.1    Materials  for  valve  seals,  diaphragms,  gaskets,\nand  O-rings  should  be  chemically  compatible  with  the\nprocess  gas.
