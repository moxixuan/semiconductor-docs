SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 200531 6.6.3 Shape  The shape decision tree in Appendix 2 fully describes the various shape parameters that can bespecified.6.6.3.1 Warp is generally the most often specified shape parameter. Only wafers of category 1.1 (2 in. diameter) donot have a warp specification. Note that there are two forms of warp, one corrected for gravitational sag and theother not so corrected.6.6.3.2 If bow is specified, a sign may be included in the specification to denote convex (positive) or concave(negative) curvature of the median surface of the wafer with the front surface up. If no sign is included in thespecification, bow may vary between -a and +a, where a is the specified maximum magnitude of bow.6.6.3.3 Sori is an attribute that may be specified with agreement between the supplier and customer in lieu of or inaddition to bow and/or warp.6.6.4 Standard Wafer Categories  The standardized dimensions, dimensional tolerances, and fiducial (flat ornotch) characteristics for various standard wafer categories are summarized in Tables 4 through 9. These categoriesof wafers shall meet all requirements listed in the appropriate table, unless an exception is negotiated betweensupplier and customer and is shown on the purchase order.6.6.4.1 Wafers of the same nominal diameter may typically have different dimensional configurations in differentregions of the world. Many of these configurations are represented in these tables. In selecting the appropriatestandard polished wafer category, consideration should be given to compatibility with processes and equipmentgenerally available in the region of use.6.6.5 Flatness  The wafers shall meet global and site flatness requirements as specified in the purchase order.Details of different flatness parameters are given in Appendix 1.6.6.6 Nanotopography  The wafers shall meet nanotopography requirements specified in the purchase order.6.7 Front Surface Chemistry6.7.1 If surface metal contamination levels are specified on the purchase order, the maximum area densities shall bedesignated in units of atoms/cm2 for specific individual elements together with the measurement method by whichthe densities are to be determined. The wafers shall not contain more than the specified density of each metal.NOTE 3: An example of such a specification applicable to 1 m geometries is given in Related Information 1.6.7.2 If surface organic contamination levels are specified on the purchase order, the maximum area densities shallbe designated in units of ng/cm2 for total surface organics density together with the method by which the density isto be determined. The wafers shall not contain more than the specified density of total surface organics.6.8 Front and Back Surface Inspection Characteristics6.8.1 The wafers shall conform to the limits on observable (visually or otherwise) front and back surfacecharacteristics as specified on the purchase order.6.8.2 For wafers of diameter 150 mm or smaller for which visual inspection of surface defects is acceptable, thedefect limits in Table 10 may be used as a guide for determining acceptable defect levels. Under thesecircumstances, minimal conditions or dimensions for surface features to be considered as defects are stated below.These limits shall be used for determining wafer acceptability; anomalies smaller than these limits shall not beconsidered defects.6.8.2.1 Item 2-8.1, scratches, macro  Any anomaly conforming to the definition that has a length-to-width ratiogreater than 5:1 and is visible under diffuse illumination as well as under high intensity illumination.6.8.2.2 Item 2-8.2, scratches, micro  Any anomaly conforming to the definition that has a length-to-width ratiogreater than 5:1 and is visible only under high intensity illumination.6.8.2.3 Item 2-8.3, pits  Any individually distinguishable nonremovable surface anomaly conforming to thedefinition that is visible when viewed under intense illumination.6.8.2.4 Item 2-8.4, haze  Haze is indicated when the image of a narrow beam tungsten lamp filament is detectableon the polished wafer surface.

Due to highmeasurement variability, data are recorded for process capability and not for individual shipment quality reports. 7.2 Effective implementation of the basic specification concept requires the standardization of many wafercharacteristics that have not historically been specified in a SEMI standard, as well as some characteristics that havehistorically been specified in SEMI standards, but have been routinely modified as a customer preference. Theresulting variety of customer specifications causes silicon suppliers to install additional processes and metrics, ordifferent processes and technologies for satisfying individual specifications. To realize the full benefits of a basicspecification, it is essential that all parameters be accepted without additional options.7.3 Wafers produced to this specification shall be qualified through routine process checks, demonstrating theprocess is in state of control. Verification of the process and quality control shall be provided on a shipment basisthrough a certification that does not require the inclusion of data specifically from that shipment.

When so specified,appropriate sample sizes shall be selected from each lot in accordance with ANSI/ASQC Z1.4. Each qualitycharacteristic shall be assigned an acceptable quality level (AQL) or lot tolerance percent defective (LTPD) value inaccordance with ANSI/ASQC Z1.4 definitions for critical, major, and minor classifications. If desired and sospecified in the contract or order, each of these classifications may alternatively be assigned cumulative AQL orLTPD values. Inspection levels shall be agreed upon between the supplier and the purchaser. 9 Test Methods9.1 Measurements shall be made or certifiable to one of the SEMI, ASTM, JEITA, JIS, or DIN standard testmethods for the item as selected from Table 1 and specified in the purchase order.9.2 If several different standard test methods for an item are commonly used within a region, it is particularlyimportant that the applicable method of test be identified in the purchase order.9.3 If no method of test is specified in the purchase order and if standard test methods from different geographicregions are available, the default method shall be a method in common usage for the region of the purchaser of thewafer.9.4 If no standard test method for an item is available, the test procedure to be used must be agreed upon betweensupplier and customer.9.5 Information about the various test methods listed in Table 1 is provided in Related Information 2 together withinformation about some additional test methods no longer in wide use throughout the industry. 10 Certification10.1 Upon request of the purchaser in the contract or order, a manufacturers or suppliers certification that thematerial was manufactured and tested in accordance with this specification, together with a report of the test results,shall be furnished at the time of shipment.10.2 In the interest of controlling inspection costs, the supplier and the customer may agree that the material shallbe certified as capable of meeting certain requirements. In this context, capable of meeting shall signify that thesupplier is not required to perform the appropriate tests in 9. However, if the customer performs the test and thematerial fails to meet the requirement, the material may be subject to rejection. 11 Product Labeling11.1 The wafers supplied under these specifications shall be identified by appropriately labeling the outside of eachbox or other container and each subdivision thereof in which it may reasonably be expected that the wafers will bestored prior to further processing. Identification shall include as a minimum the nominal diameter, conductivitytype, dopant, orientation, resistivity range, and lot number. The lot number, either (1) assigned by the originalmanufacturer of the wafers, or (2) assigned subsequent to wafer manufacture but providing reference to the originallot number, shall provide easy access to information concerning the fabrication history of the particular wafers inthat lot. Such information shall be retained on file at the manufacturers facility for at least one month after thatparticular lot has been accepted by the customer.11.2 Alternatively, if agreed upon between supplier and customer, one of the box labeling schemes in SEMI T3shall be used and the information listed in 11.1 that is not included on the label shall be retained in the suppliersdata base for at least one month after that particular lot has been accepted by the customer.11.3 Wafers of Category 1.15 (300 mm in diameter) shall be shipped in packages labeled in accordance with SEMIM45.

Approval was by full letter ballotprocedures with publication authorized by the NA Regional Standards Committee on October 21, 1999. A1-1 ScopeA1-1.1 The increasing complexity of integrated circuits and the reduction in design rule dimensions place newdemands on the characterization of wafer surface geometry. Various high resolution optical lithographic systemshave very limited depth of field and use a variety of methods to hold the wafer, to establish the focal plane, and toposition the wafer relative to the focal plane during exposure. These varying focusing and location methods differenough to make a single, simple flatness criterion (such as global TIR) ineffective in predicting successful orunsuccessful lithography in all cases.A1-1.2 To clarify the requirements for wafer flatness characterization for the various classes of lithographicequipment, the decision tree depicted in Figure A1-1 has been developed. This tree gives an orderly procedure forselecting the various parameters that must be specified if wafer flatness is specified.A1-1.3 In this tree, it is assumed that the focal point is the site center for all parameters, except for SFQD, SFQR,SFSD, and SFSR, where the focal plane is identical to the reference plane. Most flatness characterization systemsemploy this convention. However, a number of photolithographic aligners use slightly different conventions fordetermining the focal plane. Currently, the difference between the centerpoint and other focusing conventions hasnot been quantified, but it is presumed to be insignificant for material characterization purposes.A1-1.4 For sites to be included in the measurement, the site center must lie within the Flatness Quality Area(FQA). For subsites (se Figure A1-2) to be included in the measurement, the subsite center must lie within a sitewhose center is within the FQA and some of the subsite must lie within the FQA (see Figure A1-3). A1-2 Use of the Flatness Decision TreeA1-2.1 In the decision tree, there are decision blocks, shown as diamonds, whose use requires some knowledge ofthe lithographic tool to be used. The rectangular blocks require information to be furnished; this information isdependent on the device layout and the manufacturing procedures to be employed (such as dedicated or mixedaligner use).A1-2.2 Step 1  Select the Fixed Quality Area (FQA): Decide on and specify the nominal edge exclusion, EE,which defines the FQA. (See Figure 1.)A1-2.3 Step 2  Choose the Measurement Method: Choose global flatness (G) if the lithographic tool uses a single,global exposure of the wafer, or choose site flatness (S) if the lithographic tool steps across the wafer, exposing onlya portion of the wafer at a time.A1-2.3.1 If global flatness is chosen, proceed to Step 3. If site flatness is chosen, it is also necessary to specify sitesize (related to exposure area dimensions) and site array (including (a) number of sites, (b) location of sites relativeto the center of the FQA and to each other, as in an offset or bricklaying pattern, and (c) whether or not partial sitesare to be excluded).A1-2.4 Step 3  Choose the Reference Surface: Choose front surface (F) or back surface (B), depending onwhether the lithographic tool is referenced to the front or back surface.A1-2.5 Step 4  Choose the Reference Plane and Area:A1-2.5.1 For global flatness measurements, a global reference plane is appropriate. If the lithographic tool isreferenced to the back surface, an ideal plane (I) defined by the chuck which holds the wafer is appropriate. If thelithographic tool is referenced to the front surface, either a 3-point plane (3) defined by three points equally spacedabout the edge of the front surface of the wafer or a plane defined by the least squares fit to the front surface (L) maybe appropriate. The 3-point plane is appropriate if the lithographic tool holds the wafer in this fashion and does notallow interactive gimbaling of the wafer, while the least squares plane is appropriate if the lithographic tool allowsinteractive gimbaling of the wafer.

In the case of site measurements, it is possible to specify the maximum value of (R) or (D)or the percentage of the sites (or FQA) which have an (R) or (D) less than some specified value.A1-2.7 The codes in parentheses in Steps 2 through 5 may be used to form a code which uniquely defines themeasurement technique as follows: Position 1: Measurement Method (G) or (S), Position 2: Reference Surface (F) or (B),

A1-3 Future DevelopmentsA1-3.1 As noted above, there may be specific systems which are not exactly described by one of the branch ends onthis decision tree.

SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 40 APPENDIX 2SHAPE DECISION TREENOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of M1. Approval was by full letter ballot procedures withpublication authorized by the NA Regional Standards Committee on October 21, 1999.A2-1 ScopeA2-1.1 In modern wafer fabrication processes, wafer surface geometry in the unclamped state can be a sensitiveindicator of process effects. Larger wafer diameters and increasing complexity of processes and circuits haveincreased the need for accurate, standardized measurement of unclamped wafer geometry. The quantities that havehistorically been used, Bow and Back Surface Referenced Warp, may be inadequate to describe and quantify thegeometries of interest in advanced processes. Additional surface geometry quantities, such as Sori and MedianSurface Referenced Warp, have been introduced into standards.A2-1.2 In addition, there is considerable confusion as to the precise meaning of these quantities, even though theyare defined in the applicable SEMI test methods.A2-1.3 The Shape Decision Tree was developed to provide an orderly method of identifying each of the variablesinvolved in the quantities used to quantify unclamped wafer surface geometry. As such, the tree provides a conciseand precise description of each shape quantity. A branch of the tree consists of a selection of one of the choices foreach variable. The variables and the choices for each are listed in Table A1-1.A2-1.4 Four branches of the tree, representing quantities for which measurement methods have been standardizedby SEMI, are depicted in Figure A1-1. There are many other branches of the tree, not all of which may representpractical combinations of variables. A2-2 Use of the Shape Decision TreeA2-2.1 Step 1. Select the Fixed Quality Area (FQA): Decide on and specify the nominal edge exclusion, EE, whichdefines the FQA. (See Figure 1.)A2-2.2 Step 2. Select the measurement method: global (over the entire fixed quality area) or local (over a site).NOTE 1: At present, all shape quantities in common use are global measurements. The significance and use of local shapequantities have yet to be defined.A2-2.3 Step 3. Select the reference surface: front, median, or back, to be used to establish the reference plane.A2-2.4 Step 4. Select the kind of reference plane: least-squares or 3-point.NOTE 2: A measurement made with a least-squares reference plane is less affected by small changes in wafer position withinthe measurement apparatus than is a measurement made with a 3-point reference plane.A2-2.5 Step 5. Determine whether the effects of gravitational sag on the wafer are accounted for (yes) or not (no).NOTE 3: Gravitational effects may be accounted for by inverting the wafer during the measurement, by placing the wafer in avertical or nearly vertical position during the measurement, or mathematically.A2-2.6 Step 6. Select the measurement surface: front, median, or back, for which the deviations are to bemeasured.A2-2.7 Step 7. Select the measurement pattern: full scan (a regular array of measurement points over the entiremeasurement area), partial scan (a specified pattern of measurement points covering only a portion of themeasurement area), or centerpoint (measurement at the center of the wafer only).A2-2.8 Step 8. Select the parameter to be determined: range (TIR) or maximum RPD.A2-2.9 Step 9. Compare the branch thus obtained with the branches in Figure A2-1. If the branch obtainedmatches one of the branches illustrated in Figure A1-1, the resulting quantity is given by the code shown in the boxat the bottom of the branch. Standard test methods have been adopted for measurement of each of these quantities.If the branch obtained does not match any of the branches illustrated in Figure A2-1, the quantity obtained has notbeen given a standardized term, nor has a standard test method been adopted for its measurement.

Determination of the suitability of thematerial is solely the responsibility of the user. R1-1 ScopeR1-1.1 Maximum allowable surface metal contamination levels for wafers to be used in integrated circuit (IC)fabrication generally depend upon the IC device density and upon the IC process design. In general, as the devicedensity increases, the allowable surface metal contamination levels become lower.R1-1.2 This related information is intended to provide guidance regarding allowable surface concentrations of metalcontaminants that have been reported to be deleterious to circuit and device performance. R1-2 Suggested Allowable Surface MetalContamination Levels for 1 m GeometriesR1-2.1 Table R1-1 lists suggested surface metal limits forcircuits and devices with a minimum linewidth in therange of 0.8 m to 1.2 m for two alkali metals (Na, K), alight metal (Al), and five heavy metals (Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu,Zn). These are same elements as are listed in the itemsunder Section 2-7 of Table 1, Part 2, and they are listed inthe same order as they appear in that table.Contaminant levels in Table R1-1 are significantly higher thanwould be allowed for leading edge technologies at the time ofapproval of this standard.

Approval was by full letterballot procedures with publication authorized by the NA Regional Standards Committee on November 4, 2004.Determination of the suitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user. R2-1 ScopeR2-1.1 This Related Information Section discusses aspects of the various test methods listed in Table 1 togetherwith additional information about other test methods that are not listed in Table 1 but either have been or still areused in the industry.R2-1.2 The next section contains references to the test methods that are not cited in the main body of SEMI M1 butthat are discussed here. The various test methods are discussed in order that the items they cover are listed in Table1.R2-1.3 Note that silicon wafers are extremely fragile. While the mechanical dimensions of a wafer can bemeasured by use of tools such as micrometer calipers and other conventional techniques, the wafer may be damagedphysically in ways that are not immediately evident. Special care must, therefore, be used in the selection andexecution of measurement methods.NOTICE: This section does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.

X-ray methods are most commonly used by wafer suppliers. &#123;Need somediscussion here about differences between MF26 and EM-3501&#125;&#125;R2-3.2 Conductivity TypeOne of the five methods of SEMI MF42, one of the methods of JIS H 0607, or one ofthe four methods of DIN 50432 should be used to determine conductivity type. This quantity is generally wellcontrolled by silicon wafer suppliers and is not usually verified on incoming.R2-3.3 Many of these tests need to be carried out in cleanroom environments of ISO Class 4, 5, or 6 depending onthe cleanliness requirements. These classes are defined in ISO 14664-1. R2-4 Electrical CharacteristicsR2-4.1 Resistivity of wafers is most appropriately determined for referee purposes by SEMI MF84 or DIN 50431.Under some circumstances these tests may be considered destructive, and an alternative means may be required.One nondestructive test is SEMI MF673, having a range from 0.0001 to 100 Ωcm. Another nondestructive test isSEMI MF398, which is limited to carrier concentrations in the ranges from 1.5  1018 to 1.5  10 21 cm3 for n-typesilicon and from 3  1018 to 5  10 20 cm3 for p-type silicon, and has only moderate inter-laboratory precision. Otherolder methods that require a bar-shaped test specimen include SEMI MF43 and DIN 50430; these methods are nolonger in general use. It is also possible to establish the dopant density from room temperature measurements insilicon using SEMI MF723 (for boron, phosphorus, or arsenic doped silicon) or DIN 50444 (for boron andphosphorus doped silicon only). SEMI MF1527 is a useful standard in describing ways of ensuring that resistivitymeasuring instruments are performing correctly.R2-4.2 Radial Resistivity Variation is generally determined by SEMI MF81 or DIN 50435. These test methods useseveral different measurement positions so the desired position must be specified. It is also possible to measure theresistivity in one of the circular patterns specified in SEMI MF1618 using SEMI MF1529 as the resistivitymeasurement method.R2-4.3 Resistivity Striations can generally be viewed visually using one of the techniques discussed in Section R2-9. For an electrical measurement, spreading resistance (SEMI MF525) is generally employed but this is strictly anoff-line measurement.R2-4.4 Minority Carrier Lifetime can be measured by a number of methods. The photoconductive decay methods(SEMI MF28, JIS H 0604, and DIN 50440/1 all require the use of special test specimens; Microwave reflectivitymeasurements (SEMI MF1535 and JEITA EM-3502) are applicable to measurements on wafers, but special surfacepassivation procedures may be required to obtain meaningful results. Minority carrier lifetime may also be inferredfrom measurements made in accordance with SEMI MF1388, which yields generation lifetime if the measurements

&lt;!-- Page 20 --&gt;

SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 46 are made at room temperature and recombination lifetime if they are made at elevated temperature (50° to 75°C).The test specimens required for this test method can be made by procedures compatible with typical waferprocessing. R2-5 Chemical CharacteristicsR2-5.1 Oxygen Concentration in relatively high resistivity specimens ( &gt; 1 to 3 Ωcm at room temperature) shouldbe measured by infrared techniques. SEMI MF1188, JEITA EM-3504, and DIN 50438 all utilize approximatelynormal incidence illumination and the IOC-88 calibration factor to determine the interstitial oxygen content. SeeSEMI M44 for a discussion of other calibration factors and their relationship to IOC-88. SEMI MF1619 uses p-polarized radiation, incident at the Brewster angle to reduce the multiple reflections from polished wafers. For moreheavily doped wafers, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS, SEMI MF1366) and gas fusion analysis (GFA) canbe used to determine total oxygen content. There is no standardized method for performing GFA, and therepeatability of this technique is generally poorer than SIMS.R2-5.2 Radial Oxygen Variation should be determined by measuring the oxygen content by one of the abovemethods at selected locations on the wafer defined in SEMI MF951. Usually measurements are made at the centerand at a single point on the primary flat or notch bisector 10 mm from the edge of the wafer opposite the fiducial;this is known as test plan A-1.R2-5.3 Carbon Concentration should be measured by SEMI MF1391, JEITA 56, and DIN 50438/2. The mostmodern calibration coefficients are used in SEMI MF1391 and JEITA 56. For these methods, the test specimencannot be too heavily doped, and special thick test specimens may be necessary.R2-5.4 Boron Contamination in heavily doped n-type silicon can be determined by SEMI MF1528. R2-6 Structural CharacteristicsR2-6.1 Dislocation Etch Pit Density, Slip, Lineage, Twins, and Swirl are usually displayed by etching and visual ormicroscopic observation. JIS H 0609 is a comprehensive test method for carrying out this procedure with the use ofnon-chromic etchants. SEMI MF1809 also recommends non-chromic etchants for this test. For the full procedure,SEMI MF1809 must be used with other standards including SEMI MF1726 and SEMI MF1810. DIN 50434 is anolder, but comprehensive test procedure to observe these and other structural defects based on chrome-containingetchants. It is also possible to observe these defects by x-ray topography using DIN 50443/1.R2-6.2 Shallow Pits can be exposed by the relatively low temperature heating cycle and procedures in SEMIMF1049 if they are present in sufficient density, but testing for shallow pits in production environments is usuallycarried out using the temperature cycle in SEMI MF1727 followed by etching with etchants discussed in SEMIMF1809, examination by SEMI MF1726, and counting by SEMI MF1810. They can also be observed by using JISH 0609.R2-6.3 Oxidation Induced Stacking Faults (OISF) can be observed by using JIS H 0609, or by using thetemperature cycle in SEMI MF1727 followed by etching with etchants discussed in SEMI MF1809, examination bySEMI MF1726, and counting by SEMI MF1810. OISF can also be observed by x-ray topography using DIN50443/1 following thermal treatment according to JIS H 0609 or SEMI MF1727.R2-6.4 Oxide Precipitates (Bulk Micro Defects, BMD) are generated with the use of a temperature cycle such asthose in SEMI MF1239. The amount of precipitation can be measured by the oxygen reduction method of SEMIMF1239 or by direct observation by infrared that has not yet been standardized.R2-6.5 Bulk Defects can be detected by x-ray topography in accordance with DIN 50443/1. R2.7 Dimensional CharacteristicsR2-7.1 Diameter is presently very well controlled in silicon wafers that have been edge profiled with cam followerequipment. For three-point measurements at locations defined by SEMI MF2074 and, except for positions on 150mm diameter, n-type (100) wafers, by DIN 50441/4. The latter utilizes a measuring or projection microscope tomake the diameter measurements, but the former allows a dial gauge or any other equally accurate method ofdimensional measurement.

&lt;!-- Page 21 --&gt;

SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 200547 R2-7.2 Flat Length should be determined by SEMI MF671. If flat diameter is specified instead of flat length, it canbe determined by 6.2.1 of DIN 50441/4 or by a dial gauge method as agreed upon between the supplier andcustomer. Both SEMI MF671 and DIN 50441/4 take account of the possibility that the ends of the flat might berounded.R2-7.3 Notch Dimensions should be determined by SEMI MF1152 (see Figure 5).R2-7.4 Flat Orientation can be confirmed by SEMI MF847. There is no standardized method for determining thecrystallographic orientation of the diameter that bisects the notch.R2-7.5 Edge Profile is usually determined by using one of the two templates (see Figure 6) with Method B of SEMIMF928 or Procedure 2 of DIN 50441/2, both of which are nondestructive. The other two procedures in thesemethods are destructive and not so widely used.R2-7.6 Thickness is usually determined at the center point of the wafer with the use of SEMI MF1530, anautomated technique. Manual techniques originally used in the industry include SEMI MF533, JIS H 0611, andDIN 50441/1.NOTE 2: Test methods SEMI MF1530 (for thickness, thickness variation, and flatness), SEMI MF1451 (for sori), and SEMIMF1390 (for warp) may not be suitable for use on large diameter wafers with polished back surfaces. New standardized testmethods for measuring these parameters on such wafers are under development.R2-7.7 Total Thickness Variation (TTV) was originally determined with the use of manual 5-point techniquescovered in SEMI MF533, JIS H 0611, and DIN 50441/1. JIS H 0611 differs from SEMI MF533 and DIN 50441/1,in that the measurements in JIS H 0611 are taken at the center and at 5 mm from the edge on diameters parallel andperpendicular to the primary flat or notch bisector, while the measurements in SEMI MF533 and DIN 50441/1 aretaken at the center and at 6 mm from the edge on diameters 30 degrees and 120 degrees counterclockwise from thebisector to the primary flat or notch (with the wafer facing front surface up). TTV can also be determined with theuse of SEMI MF657, which involves a continuous scan pattern over a portion of the wafer surface. Currently,however, it is most frequently determined using SEMI MF1530, which involves an automated continuous scanpattern over the entire wafer surface. In this case, the quantity determined is equal to the global flatness GBIR (seeAppendix 1 and Note 1, above).R2-7.8 Surface Orientation can be determined by the x-ray methods of SEMI MF26, JEITA EM-3501, or DIN50433/1, the optical method of SEMI MF26 or DIN 50433/2, or the Laue method of DIN 50433/3.R2-7.9 For off-orientation &#123;111&#125; wafers, the orthogonal misorientation is specified for each of the wafer categoriesin Tables 4 through 9. There is no standardized measurement method for this property so it should be determined bya method agreed upon between supplier and customer.R2-7.10 Bow can be determined with the manual methods SEMI MF534 and JIS H 0611. Currently, bow is not aswidely used a parameter as warp.R2-7.11 Warp is currently most often measured with the use of SEMI MF1390, which is an automated method withfull surface scan and correction for gravitational sag. It can also be measured with the use of the contactless manualmethod SEMI MF657, in which the prescribed scan pattern covers only a portion of the wafer surface in which thereis no correction for gravitational sag. As noted in Appendix 2, different reference planes are used for the twomethods. Because SEMI MF657 employs a back surface reference plane, the measured warp may includecontributions from thickness variation of the wafer. SEMI MF1390 employs a median surface reference plane andis not susceptible to interferences from thickness variations. In general, the latter is preferred, especially for wafers150 mm in diameter and larger (see Note 1, above).R2-7.12 Sori , which is sometimes specified in lieu of bow or warp or both, can be determined by SEMI MF1451(see Note 1, above).R2-7.13 Global Flatness can be determined by either capacitance measurements, as in SEMI MF1530, or bymultiple beam interference, as in DIN 50441/3. Generally, the former is considered to be more reliable, especiallyas the need increases for measuring smaller flatness deviation (see Note 1, above). As noted in R2-7.7, GBIR is thesame as TTV; other global flatness parameters are discussed in Appendix 1.

SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 48 R2-7.14 Site Flatness is generally determined by SEMI MF1530 (see Note 1, above). The most commonly usedsite flatness parameter is SFQR; other site flatness parameters are discussed in Appendix 1. Although it is notwidely used, the scanning site flatness parameter SFSR was recently introduced. For this parameter, use a subsitewidth, Wss, equal to 8 mm and orient the wafer so the effective scan direction is along the wafers y-axis as definedin SEMI M20.R2-7.14.1 SEMI M49 is a guide for specifying test equipment for use in determining thickness, shape, and flatnessparameters on wafers intended to be used to fabricate advanced integrated circuits.R2-7.15 Nanotopography should be determined by SEMI M43. This guide gives a variety of options that can beused, so it is essential to specify the various conditions that are desired in any given case. The conditions chosenshould be agreed upon between supplier and customer. R2-8 Front Surface ChemistryR2-8.1 Surface Metal ContaminantsR2-8.1.1 Sodium, aluminum, potassium, and iron can be measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS),inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS), or atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). SIMS hasbeen standardized as SEMI MF1617. The latter two methods are frequently combined with vapor phasedecomposition (VPD), but they have not yet been standardized.R2-8.1.2 Potassium, chromium, iron, nickel, copper, and zinc can be measured by Total Reflection X-RayFluorescence Spectroscopy (TXRF), ICP/MS, and AAS. TXRF has been standardized both with (SEMI M33 andISO 17706) and without (ISO 14706) use of VPD to preconcentrate the surface metal contaminants.R2-8.1.2.1 VPD is chemical preconcentration of the surface metals using vapor phase HF to decompose the surfacenative oxide and a water (or acid-spiked water) droplet to scan across the wafer dissolving the surface metals. Therecovery rate of this preconcentration method is dependent upon the chemistry of the surface metals and upon thechemistry used for the preconcentration. An alternative preconcentration method to VPD is to scan an acid dropletacross the wafer surface.R2-8.1.2.2 VPD/AAS is a single-element technique which is widely used in Japan. It is element-specific and verysensitive. VPD/ICP-MS is a rapid multi-element technique which is a more recent development. It is also verysensitive, but its reproducibility is dependent upon the injection process into the ICP-MS. VPD/TXRF is an evenmore recently developed multi-element technique. It is also very sensitive, but its reproducibility is dependent onthe residue-drying process.R2-8.2 Surface Organics can be measured by SEMI MF1982. This standard describes two methods; the method tobe utilized should be agreed upon between supplier and customer. R2-9 Surface Inspection CharacteristicsR2-9.1 Visual Inspection of either the front or back surface of wafers can be carried out in accordance with SEMIMF523 or JIS H 0614. The following conditions should be used for examination under high intensity illumination: Background light intensity: 8 ± 2 fc (86 ± 22 lux), Angle (alpha): 45° ± 10°, and Angle (beta): 90° ± 10°.See 6.8 for a discussion of which artifacts on the surface should be considered as defects. SEMI MF154 is a usefulguide for identifying structures and contaminants seen on silicon surfaces.R2-9.1.1 ScratchesIn inspecting for scratches, it is important to note that while macro-scratches can be seen underboth high intensity and diffuse illumination, micro-scratches can be seen only under high intensity illumination.Therefore, to separate the two kinds of scratches, it is necessary to count the scratches observed under both kinds ofillumination. The count of scratches seen under diffuse illumination is the number of macro-scratches while thedifference of the counts seen under high intensity illumination and diffuse illumination is the number of micro-scratches. Of course, if the total requirement is for no scratches of either kind, then examination under highintensity illumination only is adequate.

SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 200549 R2-9.2 X-ray Topography (DIN 50443/1) can also be used to test for defects in silicon wafers. This method maysee defects that do not intersect the surface, and can also be used to examine for bulk defects in the wafer (seeSection 2.4.10 of Table 1).R2-9.3 Automated Surface Inspection by Light Scattering can also be used to detect many surface defects,especially on polished surfaces. These techniques have not been fully standardized but there is a group of standardsthat assist in making certain that the instruments are performing correctly. These include SEMI M52 fordetermining if surface scanning inspection systems (SSIS) have suitable characteristics for the desired use, SEMIM53 for calibrating SSISs, SEMI M58 for assuring that the calibration artifacts meet the desired requirements,SEMI M50 for determining capture rate characteristics of SSISs and SEMI M35 for discriminating among varioussurface features with an SSIS. Because of the lack of complete standardization, the testing conditions for use ofSSISs should be agreed upon between supplier and customer.R2-9.3.1 Localized Light Scatterers  SSISs are particularly appropriate for inspecting polished surfaces for thepresence of particles and other localized light scatterers (LLS). In this case, it is essential to define the size ranges(in units of latex sphere equivalents, LSE) as well as the maximum permissible counts, usually in terms of countsper wafer, but occasionally in terms of counts per unit area.R2-9.4 Surface Roughness affects the size of particle or other LLS that can be detected on a surface. SEMI M40provides guidance on how to measure and report surface roughness on planar surfaces. Surface microroughness canbe determined with SSISs, through the use of the power spectral density as described in SEMI MF1811, or with anatomic force microscope, which can be calibrated with the use of JEITA EM-3505. Other documents useful inconnection with surface microroughness measurements include ISO 4287/1 and ANSI/ASME B46.1. Because ofthe lack of standardization, the testing conditions for surface microroughness measurements should be agreed uponbetween supplier and customer.R2-9.5 Back Surface Finish of 300 mm diameter wafers is specified as polished. The standard quantitative testfor the polish finish, which is not a smooth as the mirror polished front surface, is gloss. The general techniques fordetermining gloss are given in ASTM Test Method D 523 and JIS Z 8741. However, for measuring gloss of siliconsurfaces, visible illumination at a 60° angle of incidence is referenced to a mirror polished silicon front surface.Surface microroughness measurements (see R2-9.4) can also be used as a quantitative test for back surface finish,especially when it is necessary to observe particles or other LLSs smaller than 0.25 m LSE on the surface.

SEMI M4-1103 © SEMI 1978, 2003 4 7.2.7 Surface Defects and Contamination  Determineby methods agreed upon between user and supplier.SEMI MF154 is a useful guide for defining a variety ofsurface features and establishing commonly understoodterms for describing surface defects and contamination.SEMI MF523 is also recommended (see Note 5).Recommended maximum levels of surface defects andcontamination are listed in Table 2.NOTE 4: SOS wafers are susceptible to surface damage. Thethin film on the hard sapphire substrate may be damagedphysically in ways that are not immediately evident. Specialcare must therefore be used in the selection and execution ofmeasurement procedures.NOTE 5: In SEMI MF523, defects commonly found insilicon wafers are defined. Some of these terms do not applyto SOS wafers, but are included in Table 2 to provide aconvenient reference point to the silicon wafer and epitaxial wafer standards. In this case, the recommended maximumacceptable limit is shown as N.A. (not applicable). 8 Sampling8.1 Unless otherwise specified, ASTM Practice E 122shall be used. When so specified, appropriate samplesizes shall be selected from each lot according toANSI/ASQC Z1.4-1993. Each quality characteristicshall be assigned an acceptable quality level (AQL) andlot total percent defective (LTPD) value in accordancewith ANSI/ASQC Z1.4-1993 definitions for critical,major, and minor classifications. If desired and sospecified in the contract or order, each of theseclassifications may alternatively be assigned cumulativeAQL and LTPD values. Inspection levels shall beagreed upon between user and supplier.

The followin g items may bespecified optionally in addition to those listed above:NOTE 4: Items in Paragraph 5.2 are less commonly specifiedthan the others, but are included for completeness asparameters for which methods of evaluation have beendeveloped. 5.2.1 Impurities other than common doping elements,5.2.2 Diffusion length, and5.2.3 Minority carrier lifetime.NOTE 5: Up to now diffusion length and minority carrierlifetime cannot be measured with sufficient inter-laboratoryaccuracy. Subsequent recommendations, following lifetimeround robin experiments, will be available in the future andwill be presented in an addendum to this standard.Even in the case of comparable and reproducible lifetime anddiffusion length measurements, the measured characteristicsmust be regarded as an indication for solar cell efficiency.There is no general relation between initial minority carrierlifetime and solar cell efficiency as other parameters such ascarbon or oxygen content will also influence the wafer in thesolar cell process. However, in practical cases a dependencebetween minority carrier lifetime and solar cell efficiency canbe found for a fixed solar cell process and a certain siliconwafer material. If one of them is changed the relation betweenthem is suspect to change too. 6 Requirements6.1 Dimensions and Permissible V ariations6.1.1 Wafer Thickness and Variation6.1.1.1 Wafer thickness is typically 33 0 micrometer in1999. In the future wafers should be specified in 50micrometer intervals in the range between 150 and 400micrometers.6.1.1.2 The variation of wafer thickne ss in a lot asmeasured according to 7.2 at the center point of eachwafer will be less than 15% of the specified waferthickness.6.1.2 Rectangular Mainly Square W afer Dimensions Depending upon the wafer type, one of the sections6.1.2.1, 6.1.2.2 or 6.1.2.3 applies. 6.1.2.1 Square Crystalline Silicon Wa fer Dimensions6.1.2.1.1 Physical dimensions  See Fi gure 1, Table2Rectangular cells are permitted as long as the measuresof A and B are according to the nominal size measuresin Table 2.Example: A = 100 mm, B = 150 mm.Dimension D (identical for all sizes) min = 0.5 mm,max = 2.0 mm.

Each quality characteristic shall beassigned an acceptable quality level (AQL) and lottolerance percent defective (LTPD) value in accordancewith ANSI/ASQC Z1.4 definitions for critical, major,and minor classifications. If desired and so specified inthe contract or order, each of these classifications mayalternatively be assigned cumulative AQL and LTPDvalues. Inspection levels shall be agreed upon betweenthe supplier and the purchaser. 7 Test MethodsNOTE 6: Silicon wafers are extremely fragile. While themechanical dimensions of a wafer can be measured by use oftools such as micrometer calipers and other conventionaltechniques, the wafer may be damaged physically in ways thatare not immediately evident. Special care must therefore beused in the selection and execution of measurement methods. 7.1 Length, Width, or Diameter  Determine thediameter of circular wafers in accordance with ASTMTest Method F 613. Determine the side length of squarewafers by a method agreed upon between the supplierand the purchaser.7.2 Thickness, Center Point  De termine inaccordance with ASTM Test Methods F 533 or DIN50441-1.7.3 Thickness Variation  Determ ine in accordancewith ASTM Test Methods F 533 or F 657.7.4 Structural Class  Determine the structural classby a method agreed upon between the supplier and thepurchaser. 7.5 Surface Orientation  Determine in accordancewith ASTM Test Methods F 26 or DIN 50433-1, DIN50433-2 and DIN 50433-3.7.6 Conductivity Type  Determi ne in accordancewith ASTM Test Methods F 42 or DIN 50432.7.7 Resistivity  Determine by m ethods agreed uponbetween the supplier and the purchaser.NOTE 7: Resistivity of wafers is most appropriatelydetermined for referee purposes by ASTM Method F 84 orDIN 50431. Reliable measurements with these methods canonly be made in regions of a wafer which contain no grainboundaries; these methods are therefore not appropriate formulticrystalline material. Under some circumstances thesetests may be considered destructive, and an alternative meansmay be required. One non-destructive test is ASTM Testmethod F 673, having a range from 0.001 to 100 Ω-cm. Thismethod is relatively insensitive to the presence of grainboundaries and is recommended for all material types.Another nondestructive test is ASTM Test Method F 398.This method is limited to carrier concentrations in the rangesfrom 1.5  10 18 cm-3 to 1.5  10 21 cm-3 for n-type silicon andfrom 3  10 18 cm-3 to 5  10 20 cm-3 for p-type, and has onlymoderate inter-laboratory precision. Other available methodsinclude ASTM Test methods F 43 or DIN 50430 (refereemethods requiring a bar-shaped sample). 7.8 Other Impurities  Determine by methods agreedupon between the supplier and the purchaser.NOTE 8: ASTM Test Methods F 1188, F 1619 and DIN50438-1 are specific tests for oxygen. ASTM F 1391 and DIN50438-2 are specific tests for carbon; special thick testspecimens are necessary. 7.9 Minority Carrier Diffusion Len gth  Determineby methods agreed upon between the supplier and thepurchaser.NOTE 9: Methods for minority carrier diffusion length arelisted in ASTM F 391. 7.10 Minority Carrier Lifetime  D etermine bymethods agreed upon between the supplier and thepurchaser.NOTE 10: Methods for minority carrier lifetimemeasurements are given in ASTM F 28 (bulk material),ASTM F 1535 (wafers) and JEIDA-53 (wafers). As the wafermethods measure an effective lifetime, the sample preparation(surface passivation) and measurement conditions willinfluence the results and must be considered. 8 Certification8.1 Upon request of the purchaser in the contract ororder, a manufacturers or suppliers certification thatthe material was manufactured and tested in accordancewith this specification, together with a report of the testresults, shall be furnished at the time of shipment.

In this context, capable of meeting shallsignify that the supplier is not required to perform theappropriate tests in Section 7. However, if the purchaserperforms the test and the material fails to meet therequirement, the material may be subject to rejection. 9 Packing and Package Lab eling9.1 Special packing requirements shall be subject toagreement between the supplier and the purchaser.Otherwise all wafers shall be handled, inspected, andpacked in such a manner as to avoid chipping,scratches, and contamination, and in accordance withthe best industry practices to provide ample protectionagainst damage during shipment.9.2 The wafers supplied under the se specificationsshall be identified by appropriately labeling the outsideof each box or other container and each subdivisionthereof in which it may reasonably be expected that thewafers will be stored prior to further processing.Identification shall include as a minimum the nominaldiameter, conductivity type, dopant, orientation,resistivity range, and lot number. The lot number, either(1) assigned by the original manufacturer of the wafers,or (2) assigned subsequent to wafer manufacture butproviding reference to the original lot number, shallprovide easy access to information concerning thefabrication history of the particular wafers in that lot.Such information shall be retained on file at themanufacturers facility for at least one year after thatparticular lot has been accepted by the purchaser.
