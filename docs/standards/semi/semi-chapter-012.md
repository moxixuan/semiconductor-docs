SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 20029 APPENDIX 1DETERMINING STATIC SENSITIVITY LEVELS NOTE: This appendix was approved as an official part of SEMI E78 by full letter ballot procedure. This appendix offersinformation related to the Sensitivity Levels contained in Section 12.5. A1-1 Recommended LevelsA1-1.1 The recommended charge and electrostaticfield levels in this guide are not based on specificprotection thresholds for individual devices or processtools. Rather, their aim is to classify the types of ESDevents or static levels that are likely to be of concern.Tool manufacturers and users should determine the typeof events that are of most concern to their products andprocess, so as to apply this guide to their needs.Information on specific device damage thresholds andtool sensitivities is best determined on an individualbasis. A1-2 Justification of Guide Recommendationsin Section 12.5 and Table 1A1-2.1 Recommendations for ESD DamageA1-2.1.1 Related Information R1-1 discusses testmethods for determining ESD damage thresholds forsemiconductor devices. Devices are qualified accordingto the highest ESD stresses they can withstand withoutmeasurable change in their operating parameters. Thissection attempts to develop guide recommendations forminimizing ESD damage based on that discussion.A1-2.1.2 Industry Device Damage Levels  Each ofthe test methods, HBM, MM, and CDM have a set ofqualification levels defined. These are contained below. HBM Classification LevelsClass Voltage0 &lt; 2501A 2504991B 5009991C 100019992 200039993A 400079993B ≥ 8000 MM Classification LevelsClass VoltageM1 &lt; 100M2 100199M3 200399M4 ≥ 400 CDM Classification LevelsClass VoltageC1 &lt; 125C2 125249C3 250499C4 500999C5 10001499C6 15001999C7 ≥ 2000 A1-2.1.3 Charge Levels for ESD Damage  Asdiscussed in Related Information R1-1.4, ESDSimulator testing uses different capacitances for eachmodel. For HBM it is 100 picofarads, for MM it is 200picofarads, and for CDM it depends on the capacitanceof the actual device being tested. In any case, it ischarge (charge = voltage  capacitance) that damagesthe device. It would seem appropriate, therefore, thatthe guide recommendations in Table 1 Section 12.5 bestated in units of charges (e.g. nanocoulombs).A1-2.1.4 Guide Recommendations  Based onindustry testing reflected in device data sheets, thereappears to be a wide range for ESD immunity insemiconductor devices. This document deals primarilywith ESD occurring within equipment. HBM type ESDdischarges are the least likely to occur withinequipment. Charged equipment parts contacting devices(MM) and charged devices contacting machine parts(CDM) are the most likely causes of ESD damage todevices in equipment. The following sensitivity levelsare defined with respect to the existing industry MMand CDM classifications.A1-2.1.4.1 Level 4  Devices are essentiallyunaffected by any reasonable level of ESD encounteredin equipment. Devices pass testing at levels higher thanMM Class M4 (400 volts  200 picofarads = 80nanocoulombs). Equipment should not create or storecharge on itself or on devices in excess of the guiderecommendation. Guide recommendation (table 1 inSection 12.5)  100 nanocoulombs.A1-2.1.4.2 Level 3  Devices are affected bymoderate levels of static charge in equipment. Devicespass testing for MM Class M4 (400 V  200 picofarads= 80 nanocoulombs) and most of MM Class M3 (over250 volts  200 picofarads = 50 nanocoulombs). Guide

Devices passtesting at MM Class M1 (100 V  200 picofarads = 20nanocoulombs) and CDM Class C4 (1 kV  10picofarad device = 10 nanocoulombs). Guiderecommendation (Table 1 in Section 12.5)  10nanocoulombs.A1-2.1.4.4 Level 1  Devices are easily damaged byeven low levels of static charge in equipment. Devicespass testing at CDM Class 1 (125 V  10 picofaradsdevice = 1.25 nanocoulombs). In most cases simulatorequipment is not designed to do testing at these verylow levels for MM. Guide recommendation (Table 1 inSection 12.5)  1 nanocoulombs.A1-2.2 Recommendations for Particle DepositionA1-2.2.1 Related Information R1-2 discusses theenhancement of particle deposition due to electrostaticfields from charges on the wafer surface. This sectionattempts to develop the guideline recommendations forminimizing particle deposition based on that discussion.A1-2.2.1.1 From Equation 3 of Related InformationR1-2.2, N/A = cvelect t (12) where N/A equals the particulate burden added to awafer during exposure time t, exposed to a particleconcentration c, in an environment characterized by anelectrostatic particle deposition velocity, velect.A1-2.2.1.2 Target values for N/A are given in theNational Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors(NTRS, 1994). These target values vary from 0.020.01defects/cm2, depending on the critical dimensions of thetechnology, and represent an upper value of theacceptable particulate concentration on a wafer at theconclusion of the fabrication sequence. For individualprocessing steps making up the fabrication sequence thetarget values are lower yet.A1-2.2.1.3 The variables c and t are process stepdependent and may or may not be controllable. Clearlyminimizing both of these variables is desirable in orderto minimize particle deposition on a wafer in anyenvironment.A1-2.2.1.4 The only variable in Equation 12 thatdepends on electrical forces is velect. Both the particlecharge and the electric field in the vicinity of the waferaffect the magnitude of velect. Particle charge isgenerally unknown unless it is deliberately controlledby a neutralizing action, such as flooding the environment with both positive and negative charges.Under these conditions a Fuchs type charge distributionis a reasonable assumption for the particle charge. Thisassumption was used to calculate the values of E0 inTable R1-2 of Related Information R1-2.3.2.A1-2.2.1.5 When the environmental electric field isless than E0, deposition of electrically neutralizedparticles is dominated by diffusion. When theenvironmental electric field is greater than E0,electrostatic forces dominate particle deposition evenwhen particle charge has been neutralized. Values ofE0 for a Fuchs charge distribution can be calculatedfrom Related Information R1-2.3.2 Equation 10. Forparticle charge greater than the Fuchs charge, velectincreases by a factor of q/q Fuchs. Unfortunately, theactual particle charge q is generally unknown.A1-2.2.1.6 Using the process step values of c and t andthe value of velect calculated from Equation 10, the valueof N/A for any process step can be estimated.Alternatively, having a target value of N/A andestimating the value of velect as outlined in the previousparagraphs, allows one to calculate the tolerable valueof ct:ct = \[N/A\]/velect (13) A1-2.2.1.7 Setting N/A = 0.01/cm2 and using Equation10 to calculate velect for a 0.1 m particle at variousvalues of electric field and particle charge, target valuesof ct can be calculated from Equation 13. The allowedexposure times in an ISO Class 1 environment (c ≤ 10 -5particles/cm3) can be deduced as shown in thefollowing table: Table A1-1 Allowed Exposure Times in an ISOClass 1 Environment E V/cm at OneWafer Radius q/qFuchsvelectcm/sec ct sec/cm3max t in ISOClass 1 sec4000 1 0.8 0.01250 12502 1.6 0.00625 62510 8.0 0.00125 125400 1 0.08 0.1250 125002 0.16 0.0625 625010 0.8 0.0125 1250200 1 0.04 0.250 250002 0.08 0.125 1250010 0.4 0.025 2500100 1 0.02 0.50 500002 0.04 0.25 2500010 0.2 0.05 5000

SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 200211 A1-2.2.1.8 Using higher values of N/A in Equation 13will increase the acceptable values of ct and max t.Accepting higher values of c will reduce max t. Theguideline table provides an order of magnitudeassessment of the degree of electric field and chargecontrol needed in specific operations. Minimum fieldand minimum particle charge are always the goal butusually not practically achievable. This guideline tableprovides background estimates of envelopes foracceptable operation in electrically chargedenvironments.A1-2.2.2 The following simplified table is offered asan alternative to Table A1-2 based on the followingassumptions:1. Calculations made for Federal Standard 209E Class1 (c ≤ 0.00124 particles/cm3).2. The value of the electrostatic field is referenced at adistance of one wafer radius from the wafer. Whileelectrostatic field measurements can certainly bemade at this distance, they are typically made at 2.5cm (1 inch) with common instrumentation. This isdescribed in SEMI E43. Measurements made at thissmaller distance will be proportionally higher, butunder varying measurement conditions, it is difficultto determine a precise relationship between electricfield and measurement distance. To provide asuitable safety factor, assume a linear relationship,rather than one proportional to the square of thedistance. For example, with a 200 mm wafer, 4000Volts/cm at 2.5 cm would result in 1000 Volts/cm at10 cm, rather than 250 Volts/cm.3. The proportionality effect of q/q Fuchs has beenexplained, as has the difficulty in actuallydetermining any value for it. For simplicity, thetable includes only the q = q Fuchs condition.4. N/A = 0.016 defects/cm2 as specified for 0.25 mtechnology in the National Technology Roadmapfor Semiconductors.

The testing mandated by the EECuses the test methods and ESD immunity levelsspecified in IEC 6100-4-2. A recent survey of 262semiconductor equipment suppliers revealed that 71%were compliant with the EEC requirements. There is anexpectation that all equipment to be used in future 300mm wafer fabrication will meet or exceed the ESDimmunity requirements of IEC 6100-4-2.A1-2.3.1.1 To test for compliance, measurements weremade with the ESD simulator described by IEC 6100-4-2 on a representative sample of semiconductorequipment. The results were as follows: ESD Simulator Testing Direct Contact Discharge Equipment TestVoltageLevel 1(2 kV) TestVoltageLevel 2(4 kV) TestVoltageLevel 3(6 kV) TestVoltageLevel 4(8 kV) TestVoltageLevel X(NOTE 1)A XB XC XD XE XF XG XH XI XJ X ESD Simulator TestingAir Discharge at 10 cm Equipment TestVoltageLevel 1(2 kV) TestVoltageLevel 2(4 kV) TestVoltageLevel 3(8 kV) TestVoltageLevel 4(15 kV) TestVoltageLevel X(NOTE 1)A XB XC XD XE XF XG XH XI XJ X

SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 2002 12 X indicates that the equipment passes ESD simulator testing at thislevel.NOTE 1: This level is subject to negotiation and has to bespecified in the dedicated equipment specification. If highervoltages than those shown are specified, special testequipment may be needed.A1-2.3.2 Static Audit  While equipment may meetthe ESD immunity levels specified in IEC 6100-4-2, itshould be remembered that static charge levels inmanufacturing environments may be substantiallyhigher. Direct measurements of static charge aredifficult, and the presence of a charge does not alwaysimply that an ESD event causing an equipmentmalfunction will occur. Some information may begained by using a fieldmeter to measure theelectrostatic field created by the surface charge.Instruments known as EMI locators may also be used insome cases to determine if ESD-related EMI isoccurring. Some representative measurements ofelectric fields from objects in various areas of asemiconductor wafer fab are as follows: Wet Etch  0.1 kV/inch to 30 kV/inch Planarization  0.1 kV/inch to 20 kV/inch Lithography  0.1 kV/inch to 20 kV/inch Dry Etch  0.1 kV/inch to 15 kV/inch Thin Film  0.1 kV/inch to 15 kV/inch Diffusion  0.1 kV/inch to 30 kV/inch Implant  0.1 kV/inch to 15 kV/inchA1-2.3.2.1 A knowledge of object capacitance andother physical properties is needed to determine if anyof the above measurements indicate an equipmenthazard due to ESD events. However, the range of themeasurements strongly indicate that such ESD eventscan occur. The examples in Related Information R1-3.3support this conclusion.A1-2.3.3 Guide Recommendations  Based on thestatic audits and equipment test data, there appears to bea wide range of static immunity in equipment as well asin the static charge levels in work environments. Asstated previously, it is difficult to establish a directcorrelation between ESD events and fieldmetermeasurements made on products, carriers, or any otherobjects in the work environment. The followingsensitivity levels are defined with recommended testlevels for each. A1-2.3.3.1 Level 4  Field measurements of staticcharge at input/exit ports are expected to exceed 10kV/inch. Equipment should pass ESD simulator testingat 8 kV direct contact discharge, 18 kV air discharge.Guide recommendation (Section 12.5) - 1200nanocoulombs (8 kV  150 picofarads).A1-2.3.3.2 Level 3  Field measurements of staticcharge at input/exit ports are expected to exceed 4kV/inch, but are less than 10 kV/inch. Equipmentshould pass ESD simulator testing at 4 kV directcontact discharge, 8 kV air discharge. Guiderecommendation (Section 12.5) - 600 nanocoulombs (4kV  150 picofarads).A1-2.3.3.3 Level 2  Field measurements of staticcharge at input/exit ports are expected to exceed 500V/inch, but are less than 4 kV/inch. Equipment shouldpass ESD simulator testing at 2 kV direct contactdischarge, 4 kV air discharge. Guide recommendation(Section 12.5) - 300 nanocoulombs (2 kV  150picofarads).A1-2.3.3.4 Level 1  Field measurements of staticcharge at input/exit ports are expected to exceed zero,but are less than 500 V/inch. Equipment should passESD simulator testing at 1 kV direct contact, 2 kV airdischarge. Guide recommendation (Section 12.5) - 150nanocoulombs (1 kV  150 picofarads).

Henry, Ph.D., Advanced MicroDevices, EOS/ESD/LU/EMC Department, Sunnyvale,CA 94538, leogesd@pacbell.net.R1-1.1 Introduction  ESD damage to devices occurswhen they come into contact with personnel andequipment. Either may store a residual charge largeenough to destroy the device if a discharge occurs. Inthe semiconductor industry, it has been established thata significant proportion of customer field returns areattributed to damage resulting from ESD.R1-1.2 Description of ESD Damage Mechanisms ESD failures are the result of either a current-inducedphenomenon or a charge-induced phenomenon, and thedamage can either be junction, contact, dielectric oroxide related. The apparent similarity in current-induced damage resulting from ESD due to humanbody model discharges (HBM) or machine modeldischarges (MM) results from the thermal nature ofboth of these process. The HBM and MM damagesresult when the temperature (joule heating) of theregion dissipating the ESD pulse energy reaches acritical value and melting occurs.R1-1.2.1 Charge-induced phenomena are predicted bythe charged device model (CDM). For CDM typedischarges, oxide punch through occurs when the ESDvoltage applied across the oxide creates a high enoughfield to break down the oxide. Excessive current flowresults, causing an oxide short, but there is no heattransfer (adiabatic process).R1-1.2.2 It should be noted here that the time durationfor typical ESD events from charged objects andpersonnel ranges from 10 to 100 nanoseconds, whileCDM type events occur in less than 1 nanosecond.R1-1.3 Device Testing ModelsR1-1.3.1 Human Body Model (HBM)  The HumanBody Model is the oldest and the most widely used ofthe three ESD models. The model attempts to replicatethe discharge from a real human when the latter touchesa device that is at a lower potential. The humancapacitance and resistance have been ideally chosen tobe 100 picofarads and 1500 ohms respectively. Thevalues were chosen after measurements were made onhumans in varying positions with respect to theirsurroundings. The resulting discharge waveform has a double exponential shape with risetime range of 210nsec and a decay constant (1/e position) of 150 ± 20nsecs. The typical peak currents range from 0.67 Ampsat 1000 volts to 2.67 Amps at 4000 volts.R1-1.3.2 Machine Model (MM)  The MachineModel is described by Electronic Industries Associationof Japan (EIAJ) as a worst case HBM. The modelattempts to replicate the discharge from a metallic armof an automatic handler coming into contact with themetallic leads of a semiconductor device which is at alower potential. A capacitance of 200 picofarads andideally zero resistance produces a sinusoidal decayingwaveform with an effective pulse duration of 200 nsec.The typical peak currents range from 1.75 Amps at 100volts to 14.0 Amps at 800 volts. Note that MM failuresoccur at 510 times lower voltage than HBM.R1-1.3.3 Charged Device Model (CDM)  TheCharged Device Model in its purest form is actually afield induced model because the device is actually partof model. This model attempts to describe a devicewhich itself becomes charged due to an external field,or due to triboelectric charging of the device surfaces.During discharge, the parasitics (capacitance,inductance and impedance) in the device play asignificant role in the resulting failure. The dischargepulse is a sinusoidal waveform with an extremely fastrisetime of less than 500 picoseconds. The waveformdecays rapidly with a total pulse duration of less than 5nano-seconds. The peak currents range from 2.0 Ampsat 250 volts charging voltage, to 18.0 Amps at 2000volts charging voltage.R1-1.3.4 Correlation Between Models  There ismuch debate on whether or not there is any type ofcorrelation between HBM and MM. While somecompanies report a correlation of roughly 10:1 betweenthe two models, other companies have seen anywherefrom 520:1 differences in passing voltages betweenthe two models. There is also no established voltagecorrelation between CDM damage and HBM or MMESD events. In equipment, ESD damage events will berelated to the MM or CDM types of ESD. Users willneed to determine the type of ESD hazard to theirdevices and choose the test method accordingly.R1-1.4 ESD Laboratory Simulation TestingR1-1.4.1 Description of Test Methods  Testprocedures discussed here for ESD simulation conform

The ESDAssociation is presently considering two documentsrelated to CDM Testing. Details are to be found in thesestandards.R1-1.4.1.1 Devices are qualified at a levelcorresponding to the highest ESD stress they are able towithstand. These levels are discussed in more detail inAppendix A1-2.1.R1-1.4.2 Simulation Test Results  In general all unitsmust be data-logged both pre- and post-stress test. Anyleakage current equal to or greater than a specificamount (company dependent  typically 10 micro-amps or less) is flagged as a failure, and any currentshift greater than about 200 nano-Amp is marked on therecord.R1-1.4.3 HBM Stress Testing  An R-C network isused to simulate the ESD event. In an HBM ESDSimulator, a high voltage is used to charge the capacitor(100 pF) which discharges through the resistor (1500ohms) into the device under test. The present draftstandard (1997) requires a minimum of two discharges(1 positive and 1 negative) per voltage level.R1-1.4.4 MM Stress Testing  An R-C network is alsoused in the MM ESD Simulator for ESD testing. Highvoltage charges the capacitor (200 pF) whichdischarges through the short wire (zero ohm) into thedevice under test. The present standard requires aminimum of six discharges (3 positive and 3 negative).R1-1.4.5 CDM Stress Testing  The package andleadframe of the device are charged by direct chargingor field induction. For the Direct Charging Method,direct contact is made to one of the device leadsconnected to the substrate or bulk material of thedevice. The device is then discharged via a one ohmresistor to ground.R1-1.4.5.1 For the Field Induced Method, the device isplaced on a metallic charging plate with the devicepackaging material touching the plate. The potential ofthe device is raised by applying a voltage to thecharging plate. The induced voltage on the device isdischarged to ground through a 1 ohm resistor thatcontacts each device lead. The present draft standard(1996) requires a minimum of 6 discharges (3 positiveand 3 negative) from each device lead. R1-1.5 Examples of Damage from Device TestingR1-1.5.1 HBM ESD Damage Figure R1-1Example of HBM Damage R1-1.5.1.1 In this example of HBM damage (refer toFigure R1-1), de-processing (removal of the processedlayers) down to the poly level and very highmagnification (SEM) examination were required inorder to see the failure site morphology of arcing fromsource to drain within the ESD protective structures.The electrical characteristics found were: resistiveshorts, leakages, low breakdown voltages and Iccfailures.R1-1.5.2 MM ESD Damage Figure R1-2Example of MM DamageR1-1.5.2.1 In the above MM example (refer to FigureR1-2), the damage was more severe than for HBM. De-processing down to the poly level and the SEMexamination showed the failure site morphology oflarge deep pits occurring at the contact(s) suggesting

Most often the oxide failureis located beneath the poly at the field oxide edge, or islocated at the poly edge adjacent to the source/drainjunction. To date all CDM ESD damage has been foundin the gate oxide at the input buffer circuitry.R1-1.6 ReferencesCook, C., Daniel, S., Proceedings EOS/ESDSymposium, Dallas, TX (1992), p. 149157Euzent, B.L., Maloney, T.J., Donner II, J.C.,Proceedings EOS/ESD Symposium, Las Vegas, NV(1991), p. 5964Morgan, I.H., A Handbook of EOS and ESD Models,AMD Internal Publication (1992)Pierce D.G., Shiley, W., Mulcahy, B., Wunder, M.,Proceedings EOS/ESD Symposium, Anaheim, CA(1988), p. 137146May, J.T., Guravage, J.F., Proceedings ISTFA, LosAngeles, CA (1990), p. 143147Avery, L.R., EOS/ESD Symposium, Orlando, Florida(1987), p. 186191Avery, L.R., Proceedings EOS/ESD Symposium, FL(1987), p. 8892Renninger, R.G., Jon, M.C., Lin, D.L., Diep, T.,Welsher, T.L., Proceedings EOS/ESD Symposium,New Orleans, LA (1989), p. 5971 Bossard, P.R., Chemelli, R.G., Unger, B.A.,Proceedings EOS/ESD Symposium, San Diego, CA(1980), p. 1722AMD Internal Publications, PLD/CQD EOS/ESD,EOS/ESD Task Force Reports, July 1993 and January1994Raymond, T., Chang, K.L., Henry, Leo G., AMD 3 rdEngineering Conference, February 1994ESD STM5.1  Sensitivity Testing  Human BodyModel (HBM) - Component LevelANSI/ESD STM5.2  Sensitivity Testing -- MachineModel (MM) - Component LevelMIL-STD-883, Method 3015.7, March,1989Gieser, H.A., Egger, P., Herrmann, M.R., Reiner, J.C.,Birolini, A., ESREF Proceedings, Bordeaux, France(1993)Henry, Leo G., Raymond, T., Mahanpour, M., Morgan,I., 20th International Symposium for Testing andFailure Analysis (ISTFA), 1994 R1-2 Enhanced Particle DepositionAttributable to Electrical Charge on a WaferContributed by Douglas W. Cooper, Ph.D., TheTexwipe Company, Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458.R1-2.1 Introduction  The presence of excesselectrical charge on a wafer can create an electrostaticfield that will lead to accelerated deposition of particlesonto the wafer. This undesirable consequence is but oneof several threats to product yield posed by the presenceof excess electrical charge on a wafer. Sections R1-1and R1-3 of this related information discuss two otherimportant and potentially damaging consequences ofsurface charge.R1-2.1.1 The purpose of the discussion in this sectionis to estimate the magnitude of electrostatic field thatcan be tolerated before electrostatically enhancedparticle deposition becomes the dominant particledeposition mechanism. Over the particle size range 0.01to 0.3 m, diffusion is the dominant, non-electrostaticmechanism of particle deposition. Thus, values ofelectrostatic fields that do not produce particledeposition velocities greater than those attributable toparticle diffusion will be deemed tolerable. A set ofsuch values calculated under a specific and veryrestrictive set of conditions are presented in this section.R1-2.2 Theoretical Background  Although there arenumerous electrostatic interactions between particlesand surfaces, the dominant one is almost always theCoulombic interaction: the attraction (or repulsion) of

This is the onlyelectrostatic effect considered here.For particles of one diameter, d, and one charge, q, theparticle deposition flux, j, (the number of particlesdeposited per unit area per unit time) is the product ofaerosol particle number concentration, c; particlecharge, q; the electric field created by the chargedwafer, E; and particle mechanical mobility, B (terminalvelocity per unit external force):j = cqEB (1)The group qEB is the electrostatic depositionvelocity, velectvelect = qEB = j c (2)The variables q and E are those containing the electricalparameters that affect the magnitude of velect; B dependson particle diameter but not electrical properties.It is the velect values that will be calculated forcomparison with those of vdiff , the particle depositionvelocity attributable to particle diffusion. Values of Efor which velect &lt; vdiff will be those deemed tolerable inwafer manufacturing.Note that the total number of particles, N, deposited ona wafer, obtained by integrating Equation (1) over thewafer area, A, and the time of exposure, t, depends on cas well as the deposition velocity:N = cqEBAt or N / A = ctv elect (3)Reducing c obviously reduces N, but the relativeimportance of the differing deposition mechanisms andthe values of the deposition velocities associated withthese mechanisms are assumed to not depend upon c, atleast to a first-order approximation (see, for example,Peters and Cooper, 1991).R1-2.2.1 Effect of the Particle Charge, q  There aremany charging and discharging mechanisms forparticles, so q is hard to predict and likely to be highlyvariable. In a normal atmosphere the positive andnegative air ions tend to have roughly equaleffectiveness in charging particles, so that the numberof positively charged particles is roughly equal to thenumber of negatively charged particles. Thus, abouthalf the particles will be attracted and half repelled by anet charge on the wafer. Special circumstances, such ascorona discharge ionizers that are not balanced, couldalter this conclusion. Without ionizers, cleanrooms tendto have relatively low levels of ions compared to theoutdoor or other indoor atmospheres, because theHEPA/ULPA filters efficiently remove ions from therecirculating air.R1-2.2.1.1 A Boltzmann charge equilibrium, thecharge distribution approximated by aerosol particles exiting a radioactive neutralizer, is a plausible lowerlimit for particle charge and will be assumed in thecalculations of velect, using an improved version of thisdistribution developed by Fuchs (1964). Upper limitson particle charge are determined by ion emission limitsor, in the case of water droplets, the Rayleigh limit.However, assuming higher particle charge distributionsusually means that velect &gt; vdiff for virtually any value ofE &gt; 0 and that the only method for avoidingelectrostatically enhanced particle deposition is toreduce wafer charge to zero. Thus, the Fuchs chargedistribution will be assumed in calculating velect eventhough it represents the most favorable particle chargedistribution for minimizing electrostatically enhancedparticle deposition. Under many practical circumstancesthe particle charge will be greater and the maximumtolerable electrostatic field will be lower than thatcalculated for the Fuchs charge levels.R1-2.2.2 The Electrostatic Field, E, Induced by theWafer Surface Charge  The electrostatic field willdepend on the charge on the wafer divided by a quantitywith the units of length squared; either a distancesquared (far from the wafer) or an area (close to thewafer) or some combination at intermediate distances.While field is not properly measured as a voltage,measuring the voltage, V, at a fixed distance, s, from thewafer allows inferring the field from V/s and theappropriate geometric and dimensional factors. Theelectrostatic field to be used in Equation (2) can beestimated from the ratio of the wafer charge to thewafer surface area, or the average field near the surfaceat the center, E0.R1-2.2.2.1 Very far from the wafer, many waferdiameters away, the field created by the net wafercharge, Q, will be similar to that from a point charge:E1 = k1 Q r 2 (4)where k1 depends on the system of units used; and r isthe distance from the center of the wafer to the particle.R1-2.2.2.2 Very close to the wafer, a fraction of awafer diameter away, the field created by the net wafercharge is:E2 = k2 Q r2 (5)where Q' is the net wafer charge, assumed to beuniformly distributed, contained within the intersectionof a sphere of radius, r, and centered on the point of thewafer closest to the particle.R1-2.2.2.3 This equation indicates that the chargedistribution on the wafer can make a difference close tothe wafer. For an insulating wafer with a uniformcharge and a radius, R:E2 = E0 = k2 QR2 (6)

SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 200217 at a distance r = R from the center of the wafer.R1-2.2.2.4 For a conductive wafer, or for a wafer withlocalized regions of charge, the electric field will varyover the surface, causing greater and lesser depositionvelocities. A conductive wafer will have the chargeconcentrated near the edges, producing a relatively highfield there and much lower fields as the center isapproached.R1-2.2.2.5 Note that both E1 and E2 are proportional toQ and therefore, other variables being equal,electrostatic deposition is expected to be proportional toQ. Thus, the criterion to be specified is not the tolerablecharge on the wafer but the tolerable electrostatic fieldnear the wafer surface (such as that evaluated at adistance of one radius perpendicular to the wafersurface above its center), E0. A maximum tolerablevalue of E0 will be estimated by calculating themaximum E0 values for which velect &lt; vdiff, assuming aFuchs distribution for the particle charge.R1-2.3 Tolerable Electrostatic FieldR1-2.3.1 Particle Deposition Velocity Attributable toConvective Diffusion (vdiff)  In a microelectronicscleanroom, airflow is generally laminar(unidirectional) downward at about 50 cm/sec (100ft/min). If the flow is perpendicular to a surface, such asa wafer of diameter, Dw, a boundary layer forms acrosswhich particles diffuse to the surface. Liu and Ahn(1987) adapted the correlation of Sparrow and Geiger(1985) and obtained a correlation for the averagediffusive deposition velocity as:v diff = 1.08 Sc1 3Re1 2 D \* Dw (7) where Sc =/D \* is the Schmidt Number is the gas viscosity is the gas densityand D\* = kTB is the particle diffusivityk is the Boltzmann constantT is the absolute temperature andB is the particle mobilityand Re =UDw / is the Reynolds numberU is the gas velocity andDw is the wafer diameterBae et al. (1994) reviewed the experimental work ofothers and presented their own, supporting thiscorrelation; Cooper et al. (1990) obtained a similarequation by a somewhat different method. Oh et al.(1996) summarized prior experimental and theoreticalwork and extended the numerical analysis with aturbulent transport properties model, finding a smallincrease in deposition for the conditions modeled.These authors publications support the approximation that the diffusional deposition velocity is about 0.006cm/sec at particle diameter of 0.25 m and about 0.03cm/sec at particle diameter of 0.01 m, or:v diff = (0.03 cm / sec)/(d / 0.01m)1 2 (8)for 0.01 m ≤ d ≤ 0.3 m in cleanroom air.R1-2.3.2 Particle Deposition Velocity Attributable toElectrostatic Forces (v elect )  Using a power law toapproximate the Fuchs particle charge distributionyields the following approximation for electricalmobility (Cooper et al., 1990):Z = qB = (0.002 cm / s) /(d / 0.01m)(1 V / cm) (9)from which the deposition velocity attributable toelectrostatic forces becomes:velect = (0.002 cm / s)\[E0 /(V / cm)\]/(d / 0.01m) (10)Setting velect/vdiff = 1 results in the following expressionfor tolerable E0:\[(E0 /(V / cm)\] = 15 \[d /(0.01m)\]1 2 (11)Table R1-2 lists the values of tolerable electrostaticfield adjacent to a wafer surface as calculated fromEquation (11). Note that the electrostatic fields arecalculated at a distance of one wafer radius from thecenter of the wafer. E0 is the value of electric field atwhich electrostatically enhanced particle deposition isestimated to match the particle deposition velocityattributable to diffusion, assuming a Fuchs chargedistribution on the particles. This charge distributionrepresents a minimal particle charge. With most particlecharge distributions to be encountered in practice, evenlower values of electrostatic fields will produceenhanced deposition. A safe conclusion is that there isno safe value of electrostatic field that will avoidenhanced particle deposition unless neutralization ofparticle charge has been achieved, in which case thevery modest values of electrostatic fields calculatedfrom Equation (11) and tabulated in Table Rl-2 shouldbe tolerable.

In most realisticenvironments the particle charge will be greater and thetolerable electrostatic field, even lower. Hence theconclusion that in all practical processing environmentselectrical forces will be the dominant mechanism ofparticle deposition on wafers.R1-2.4.1 In a Federal Standard 209E Class 1environment (c ≤ 0.00124 particles/cm3) with velect, ~0.01 cm/s (the value predicted by Equation 10 for a 0.1m particle in an electric field of 47 Volts/cm) thetarget areal particle densities (N/A = 0.016 particles/cm2for the 0.25 m technology of 1998) specified in theNational Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors(NTRS, 1994) will be reached after an exposure time ofabout 1300 seconds, assuming c is at its maximumallowed concentration.R1-2.4.2 With less favorable electrical conditions, orhigher particle concentration, the maximum allowedexposure time becomes shorter. In addition, the targetvalues for N/A continue to decrease with eachtechnology generation. Fortunately, one or more of theparameters, particle concentration in the ambient, thecharge level on a surface, or the time a charged surfaceis exposed to a given particle ambient, can becontrolled.R1-2.4.3 Charge Neutralization  Achieving theFuchs charge distribution by means of radioactiveisotopes or balanced corona neutralizers  is the firststep in controlling particle deposition on wafers. Thisstep, while clearly necessary, is unlikely to be sufficient to guarantee meeting the NTRS requirements of thefuture. Steps to minimize environmental particleconcentration, c, and time of exposure, t, will have to bepart of the strategy for creating acceptable processingenvironments. Minimizing these variables reducesparticle deposition attributable to all mechanisms, notjust electrostatic deposition.R1-2.4.4 Contemporary standards recognize the needfor reduced particle concentrations in waferenvironments. For example, the classification ISO Class1 (of the proposed international standard for classifyingcleanrooms according to concentration of airborneparticulate cleanliness) describes an environment inwhich the concentration of particles &gt; 0.1 m is 10-5particles/cm3 or less. In an environment of this quality,wafer exposure can be as long as 105 seconds at thedeposition velocity predicted for neutralized 0.1 mparticles (~0.01 cm/s) and still meet the target defectdensity that the NTRS recommends for the 0.1 mtechnology anticipated in 2007. Fractional increases inthe electric field above 47 Volts/cm will decrease theallowed exposure time by that same fraction (Equations10, 12)  an electric field of 94 Volts/cm reduces theallowed exposure time to 5  10 4 seconds, etc.R1-2.5 ReferencesBae, G.N., Lee, C.

Fosnight, Vaughn P. Gross,Kenneth D. Murray, Richard D. Wang, IBMCorporation published in 1993 MicrocontaminationConference proceedingsR1-2.6.3 Summary: Submicron particle contaminationcontinues to be a concern in the manufacture ofintegrated circuits. Quantifying particle depositionvelocity (the ratio of particle deposition rate to airborneparticle concentration) is of fundamental importance inunderstanding the defect-density impact of airbornecontamination.R1.2.6.4 As particle size decreases, the effect ofelectrostatic charge plays an increasing role in thedeposition of particles onto surfaces. This four-trialstudy examines the deposition of 0.1 to 1.0 micronparticles onto horizontal, grounded and electrostaticallycharged, silicon monitor wafers in an 80 feet per minutevertical unidirectional airflow. The experimentaldeposition velocity results were compared to theoreticalpredictions found in the literature.R1-2.6.5 Three primary observations were obtainedfrom this study. First, measured values of depositionvelocity agreed reasonably well with predicted values.However, deposition velocity was not observed toincrease below 0.2 micron. Secondly, particles less than0.5 micron were observed to deposit onto chargedwafers approximately three to ten times faster than ontogrounded (not charged) wafers. Finally, settling monitorwafers may be a time consuming (and expensive)means of certifying the cleanliness of a clean (lessthan 10 ppcf at scanner threshold particle size)environment. However, settling-monitor studies shouldnot be confused with particles-per-wafer-pass (PWP)measurements; PWP measurements often provideuseful information regarding the performance of theautomation and/or process of a tool, even if it is in avery clean environment.

SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 200221 RELATED INFORMATION 2STATIC CONTROL METHODS NOTE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E78 and is not intended to modify or supercede the officialstandard. Determination of the suitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user. R2-1 Static Charge ControlR2-1.1 It is usually impossible to totally eliminatestatic electricity from work areas, but with proper use ofequipment and remedial procedures, most staticproblems can be controlled. Many approaches tocontrolling static charge have been tried over the yearsand it is clear that there exists no single method forcontrolling all static charge problems. R2-2 Grounding Conductors and StaticDissipative MaterialsR2-2.1 An important consideration in selecting amethod is whether the charged material is a conductoror an insulator. Static dissipative materials are createdby lowering the resistivity of insulating materialsthrough the addition of metal or carbon particles, orother chemical additives. Static charge on a conductiveor static dissipative object can be easily controlled if theobject is provided with a path for the charge to flow toearth ground. While charge is mobile in a conductor (orin a static dissipative material), in insulators charge isnot mobile, and earth grounding is not an effectivemeans of eliminating the static charge.R2-2.2 Equipment manufacturers can use bothconductive and static dissipative materials to reduce thepresence of static charge. If there is a path for thecharge to flow to earth ground, the static charge onequipment, and materials handled by the equipment,can be rapidly, and harmlessly, neutralized. Obviously,the success of earth grounding depends on maintainingthe integrity of the ground path. This is sometimes aproblem when high-speed, moving parts of equipmentmust be connected to earth ground.R2-2.3 Static dissipative materials will need to retaintheir dissipative properties over the range oftemperature and humidity conditions they willencounter, and not change significantly over time. Incleanrooms they must also meet requirements foravoiding micro-particle production and outgassing. Aslong as the ground connection is maintained, thesepassive procedures offer reasonable protection to theequipment and product from sources of static charge.R2-2.4 Unfortunately, these methods do not providecomplete protection from static-related problems. Evenwhen earth grounding is an option, it is subject tohuman error. In applications where contamination is anissue, additives and carbon particles used in static- dissipative materials may become sources ofcontamination themselves. When earth grounding or theuse of dissipative materials is either inappropriate or notcost effective, ionization can be used. R2-3 IonizationR2-3.1 More often than not, the product itself usesinsulating materials, making earth groundingunavailable as an option. While silicon is asemiconductor, its oxide coating transforms it into aninsulator. Teflon is used in many chemical processes,and quartz in high temperature processes. Epoxy andceramic packages are used for integrated circuits.Insulators are easily charged, retain their charge forlong periods of time, and are often close to the product.Dealing with static charge on insulators and isolatedconductors will often require the use of some type ofionization. Ionizers are the most effective means ofdealing with static charges on insulators and isolatedconductors.R2-3.2 For purposes of static charge control, ions aremolecules of the gases in air (nitrogen, oxygen, watervapor, and carbon dioxide) that have lost or gained anelectron. Ions are present in normal outside air but areremoved when air is subjected to filtration and airconditioning. Ionization systems work by increasing theconductivity of the air with the ionized gas molecules.When ionized air comes in contact with a chargedsurface, the charged surface attracts ions of the oppositepolarity. As a result, the static electricity that has builtup on products, equipment and surfaces is neutralized.R2-3.3 The most common methods of producing airions are radioisotopes and corona discharge resultingfrom the electric field created when high voltage isapplied to a sharp point.R2-3.4 The radioisotope most commonly used toproduce ionization is Polonium210, an alpha particleemitter. The alpha particle collides with the surroundinggas molecules, dislodging electrons, which results inpairs of positive and negative ions.R2-3.5 The corona discharge method produces a veryhigh electric field that interacts with the electrons in thesurrounding gas. The polarity of the ions depends onthe polarity of the high voltage on the emitter point.Ions of opposite polarity to the charged surface arerequired. Either polarity of static charge may be createdin the equipment or on the product.

SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 2002 22 R2-3.6 Ionizers in equipment must deliver ionizationover a wide range of humidity and temperatureconditions. Back-end assembly and test areas often donot have the level of temperature and humidity controlfound in front-end wafer production. Ionizers installedin the cramped spaces of production equipment will beclose to the product, in areas surrounded by groundedmetal parts. Ionizers should isolate the emitter pointsfrom both the product and adjacent grounded surfaces.Ionizers should produce sufficient ions to dischargestatic on surfaces and products moving at high speedsdespite losses to ground. Most ionizers requiremaintenance and periodic verification of theirperformance. R2-4 Problem of Controlling Static Charge inManufacturing EquipmentR2-4.1 The interior of high speed productionequipment presents a challenge to most static control methods. The cost of production space is high andrequires that equipment occupying the space becompact and operate at as high a speed as practical.Product is moved through small spaces at high speed bya variety of robotic and other mechanisms. Triboelectriccharging (charge generation due to friction or contactand separation of dissimilar materials) and contact withground are almost unavoidable. Grounding ofequipment parts that contact the product presents addeddifficulties when the equipment parts are moving athigh speeds. Dissipating charge from insulatingsurfaces and integrated circuit (IC) packages may bedifficult if the charged surfaces are not accessible.Using ionizers in these confined spaces presentschallenges.

SEMI E79-0304 © SEMI 1999, 20041 SEMI E79-0304SPECIFICATION FOR DEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT OFEQUIPMENT PRODUCTIVITY This specification was technically approved by the Global Metrics Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Metrics Committee. Current edition approved by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on October 15, 2003 and December 4, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.orgFebruary 2004; to be published March 2004. Originally published February 1999; last published February2000. 1 Purpose1.1 The document provides metrics for measuringequipment productivity. 2 Scope2.1 The document defines metrics and calculations formeasurement of equipment productivity.2.2 In the context of this document, it is important tonote that equipment productivity is impacted greatlyby factors far beyond the equipment itself, includingoperator, recipe, facilities, material availability,scheduling requirements, etc.2.3 Effective application of this specification requiresthat equipment performance is tracked using the metricsfor Equipment Reliability, Availability, andMaintainability (RAM) established in SEMI E10.Additionally, the Automated Reliability, Availability,and Maintainability Standard (ARAMS) SEMI E58 canbe used for equipment with ARAMS capability.Productivity metrics for flexible-sequence cluster toolsrequire tracking of SEMI E10 equipment states andrecipes at the level of individual processing modules.The Equipment Performance Tracking (EPT) StandardSEMI E116 assists SEMI E79 by providing the statusof the major modules of the equipment allowingperformance metrics to be tracked at the module level.SEMI E116 also assists SEMI E79 by providing task-level detail of the equipment or modules currentactivity, allowing performance metrics to be tracked atthe task level. Productivity performance of a flexible-sequence cluster tool is then calculated as the aggregateproductivity performance of its individual processingmodules.2.4 This document is currently limited to measuringequipment productivity using Overall EquipmentEfficiency (OEE) as the metric, and does not addressthe impact of productivity changes on cost, cycle time,or other measures. This document does not address anyRAM issues over and above those in SEMI E10.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E10  Specification for Definition andMeasurement of Equipment Reliability, Availability,and Maintainability (RAM)SEMI E38  Cluster Tool Module Communications(CTMC)SEMI E58  Automated Reliability, Availability, andMaintainability Standard (ARAMS): Concepts,Behavior, and ServicesSEMI E116  Provisional Specification for EquipmentPerformance TrackingNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 4 Terminology4.1 Terminology Applicable to Computation of theOEE Metric4.1.1 actual unit output (units)  the number of unitsprocessed by the equipment during production time.4.1.2 availability efficiency (time divided by time) the fraction of total time that the equipment is in acondition to perform its intended function.4.1.3 cluster tool  a manufacturing system made upof integrated processing modules mechanically linkedtogether (the modules may or may not come from thesame supplier) (SEMI E10).4.1.4 downtime (equipment downtime) (time)  thetime when the equipment is not in a condition, or is notavailable, to perform its intended function.

The domain for productivity improvement of alllosses except operational efficiency is shared betweenthe equipment supplier and equipment user.Productivity improvement of operational efficiency isthe exclusive domain of the equipment user.5.1.2 The formulas introduced in this section require asinputs the following fundamental quantities: total time,equipment uptime, production time, and theoreticalproduction time. Sample calculations for each of theformulas are provided in Appendix 1.5.1.3 For efficiency measurement of individualprocessing modules or of fixed-sequence cluster tools,the fundamental quantities may be tallied in astraightforward manner, and consequently the formulasof this section may be applied in a straightforwardfashion. 5.1.4 For efficiency measurement of flexible-sequencecluster tools, determination of the fundamentalquantities requires more involved calculations.Formulas are provided in Section 6 for computing thefundamental quantities for flexible-sequence clustertools. These fundamental quantities then may be usedas inputs to the formulas of this section to compute theefficiency of a flexible-sequence cluster tool.5.1.5 Additional supplemental efficiency metrics thatwill enable users to assess more specific aspects ofequipment productivity are: Reference OEE, Engineering OEE, Value-Added In-Process OEE, Demand Equipment Efficiency, Production Equipment Efficiency, and Intrinsic Equipment Efficiency.Definitions and formulas for these metrics are presentedin Appendix 2.5.2 Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE)  Thefraction of total time that equipment is producingeffective units at theoretically efficient rates.Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE)= (Theoretical Production Time for Effective Units)/(Total Time)= (Availability Efficiency)  (Performance Efficiency) (Quality Efficiency)5.2.1 Availability Efficiency  The fraction of totaltime that the equipment is in a condition to perform itsintended function.Availability Efficiency =(Equipment Uptime)/(Total Time)5.2.2 Performance Efficiency  The fraction ofequipment uptime that the equipment is processingactual units at theoretically efficient rates.Performance Efficiency =(Operational Efficiency)  (Rate Efficiency)5.2.2.1 Operational Efficiency  The fraction ofequipment uptime that the equipment is processingactual units.Operational Efficiency =(Production Time)/(Equipment Uptime) 5.2.2.2 Rate Efficiency  The fraction of productiontime that equipment is processing actual units attheoretically efficient rates.Rate Efficiency == (Theoretical Production Time for Actual Units)/(Production Time)

These quantities serve as inputsto the formulas of Section 5 for efficiencymeasurement.6.1.1 Flexible-sequence cluster tool productivity ismeasured at the individual processing module level ofdetail according to a virtual machine model described inthis section. Productivity performance for the entireflexible-sequence cluster tool is then calculated as theaggregate productivity performance of its individualprocessing modules.NOTE 5: Evaluation of flexible-sequence cluster toolproductivity does not necessarily apply to the evaluation offlexible-sequence cluster tool RAM.6.2 Virtual Machine Model6.2.1 A virtual machine is an individual processingmodule in combination with the transport mechanismsthat serve that processing module. When a transportmechanism is engaged in a material handling operationthat does not involve a particular processing module, itis not considered to be operating as part of the virtualmachine defined for that processing module. 6.2.2 Theoretical production time per unit for a recipeis the sum of theoretical times for all requiredoperational elements: Wafer loading, Elements occurring within a process module, and Wafer unloading.6.2.2.1 Where appropriate, a combined loading andunloading time may be replaced with a singletheoretical value for a wafer exchange.6.3 Fundamental Quantities for Virtual Machines andFlexible-Sequence Cluster Tools  This section definesfundamental quantities that are evaluated for individualvirtual machines and flexible-sequence cluster tools asinputs to the formulas presented in Section 5. In eachcase, the fundamental quantity is determined for eachindividual virtual machine within a flexible-sequencecluster tool. The equivalent fundamental quantity forthe flexible-sequence cluster tool is the sum of thequantities for the individual virtual machine.NOTE 6: It is recognized that application-specificinteractions between virtual machines within flexible-sequence cluster tools may impose varying amounts ofstandby time on the individual virtual machines. Thisapproach treats these interactions as standby losses for theflexible-sequence cluster tool and does not make any

Flexible-Sequence Cluster Tool Production Time ==j(Production Time for Virtual Machine j) NOTE 7: In this quantity, elapsed times for transportoperations that reposition units from one virtual machine toanother are intentionally credited to both modules. Also note that this aggregate measure may be larger than the elapsedtime observed and can only be compared with similaraggregate flexible-sequence cluster tool metrics.6.3.3 Equipment Uptime6.3.3.1 Equipment uptime is defined to measure thetotal time, during a period of observation, that a virtualmachine or a flexible-sequence cluster tool is in acondition to perform processing in some form.6.3.3.2 SEMI E10 defines equipment uptime asincluding E10 productive time, engineering time, andstandby time. This definition applies to individualvirtual machines of a flexible-sequence cluster tool.For the flexible sequence cluster tool as a whole,production time is the sum of production times for theindividual virtual machines. This production time isused in lieu of productive time.6.3.3.3 Virtual Machine Equipment UptimeVirtual Machine Equipment Uptime =Virtual Machine Production Time+ Virtual Machine Engineering Time+ Virtual Machine Standby Time6.3.3.3.1 Virtual Machine Engineering Time  Thesum of all periods of time in which a virtual machine isuser-selected for the exclusive use of engineeringproduct, process, and/or equipment experiments.Engineering time may be declared for one virtualmachine without having to declare engineering time forall virtual machines.6.3.3.3.2 Virtual Machine Standby Time  The sum ofall periods of manufacturing time not counted inproduction time, when the virtual machine is capable ofstarting new work.6.3.3.4 Flexible-Sequence Cluster Tool EquipmentUptime Flexible-Sequence Cluster Tool Equipment Uptime =j (Virtual Machine Equipment Uptimefor Virtual Machine j) 6.3.4 Total Time6.3.4.1 Virtual Machine Total Time  For individualvirtual machines, virtual machine total time is triviallydefined as all time observed (at the rate of 24 hours perday and seven days per week).6.3.4.2 Flexible-Sequence Cluster Tool Total TimeFlexible-Sequence Cluster Tool Total Time =j(Virtual Machine Total Timefor Virtual Machine j) =(Total Time Observed)  (Number of Virtual Machines)

While the idle time due to no product is excludedfrom the operational losses in these particular measuresof equipment efficiency, the user should be aware thatthe additional productivity losses due to sub-optimalload or batch sizes may also be present as rateefficiency losses. Such losses, which result fromfluctuations in product flow or tool loading policies, areconsidered in any equipment efficiency calculation thatuses theoretical time per unit.A2-2.3 Production Equipment Efficiency (PEE) Ameasure of equipment productivity during the time thatwork is available to process at the tool. One applicationof PEE is to measure the productivity of non-constrainttools, which are expected to have periods of idle timedue to lack of available work. Production Equipment Efficiency (PEE)= (Theoretical Production Time for Effective Units)/\[(Operations Time) - (No Product Time)- (Equipment Down No Product Time)\] = Overall Equipment Efficiency  Total Time/\[(Operations Time) - (No Product Time)- (Equipment DownNo Product Time)\] A2-2.3.1 Sample Production Equipment Efficiency(PEE) Calculation Production Equipment Efficiency (PEE)= (146 hours)/\[(168 hours) - (6 hours) - (4 hours)\]= 0.9241 A2-2.4 Demand Equipment Efficiency (DEE)  Ameasure of equipment productivity during the time thatwork is planned to be available to process at theequipment. A factory model or production schedulethat defines the expected or planned idle time at the equipment is required to calculate Demand EquipmentEfficiency. DEE measures the productivity of theequipment relative to the requirements of the factorymodel or production schedule. Demand Equipment Efficiency (DEE)= (Theoretical Production Time for Effective Units)/\[(Operations Time) - (Planned No Product Time)\] = Overall Equipment Efficiency  Total Time/\[(Operations Time) - (Planned No Product Time)\] A2-2.4.1 Sample Demand Equipment Efficiency (DEE)Calculation Demand Equipment Efficiency (DEE)= (146 hours)/\[(168 hours) - (8 hours)\]= 0.9125 A2-2.5 Intrinsic Equipment Efficiency (IEE) Ameasure of equipment productivity that comparesvalue-added, in-process theoretical production time tothe actual production time. IEE measures the combinedproductivity losses due to rate efficiency losses, recipedesign, and equipment design. Intrinsic Equipment Efficiency (IEE)= \[i (Actual Units of Recipe i  VTHTi )\]/(Production Time) where VTHTi = value-added in-process theoretical productiontime per unit for recipe i. See Section A2-1.3.

SEMI E79-0304 © SEMI 1999, 2004 18 RELATED INFORMATION 1GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING THEORETICAL PRODUCTION TIMEPER UNIT NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E79. This related information was approved forpublication by vote of the responsible committee on December 15, 1999. R1-1 BackgroundR1-1.1 Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) iscomputed in terms of the theoretical production timeper unit for each recipe performed. This theoretical timeper unit is based on the actual recipe, the actualequipment design in use, and an assumed load size thatoptimizes equipment throughput (expressed in units ofoutput per hour) for that recipe.R1-1.2 OEE is intended to express the true efficiencyof the equipment resource. A score of 50% OEEindicates that exactly half of the maximum productivepotential of the equipment resource is being realized; ascore of 100% indicates that no further increase inproductivity is feasible, taking the existing processrecipes and equipment design as given.R1-1.3 To accurately calculate OEE in turn requiresthat theoretical production times per unit be accuratelydefined. In particular, theoretical production times perunit shall be defined so that the speed losses are alwaysnon-negative, i.e., Speed Losses= (Production Time) - (Theoretical Production Time forActual Units) ≥ 0 R1-1.4 According to now-classical industrialengineering practice, standards for ideal performanceare determined by application of the following: Break work methods down into their operationalelements (hereafter simply referred to as elements). Study each of these elements separately todetermine its ideal duration. Design a new ideal method offering the shortestsequence of only the necessary elements (where theterm sequence as used herein may involveparallel performance of some or all elements).R1-1.5 It is remarked that even when the durations ofall elements are ideal, if the sequence of elements is notideal, ideal overall performance cannot be achieved.Based on this understanding, theoretical processingtime for an equipment recipe shall be based on both anideal element sequence as well as ideal durations for allelements. R1-2 Modeling Operational ElementSequencesR1-2.1 A graphical model of the sequence ofoperational elements comprising the performance of anequipment recipe can be helpful for determiningtheoretical production time per unit. This model has thefollowing components:R1-2.2 Resource Utilization Chart  a Gantt chartdisplaying a separate timeline for each primary resourcewithin the equipment. Utilization sequences displayedfor each primary resource may be used to show howeach resource within an equipment system is utilized,and how resources may interact.R1-2.3 Operational Element  An operationalelement occurring within a utilization sequence isdepicted by a box-shaped bar with a label. The time forthis element to execute may be fixed, recipe-dependent,or calculated from parameters. Operational elementsthat are not related to material handling operations havea thick outline. Operational Element R1-2.3.1 Material handling elements have a thinoutline. Material HandlingOperational Element R1-2.4 Repeated Groups  A bracket underneath agroup of operational elements indicates that the grouprepeats multiple times based on the parameter shown.For elements that occur conditionally, the number ofrepetitions may be zero. These repetitions apply to allelements in all timelines positioned in the vertical rangeof the bracket. RepeatedOperational Element(s) x (# repetitions) R1-2.5 Sub-Sequences  A number in front of anelement label indicates that the element represents a

&lt;!-- Page 35 --&gt;

SEMI E79-0304 © SEMI 1999, 200419 group of elements defined elsewhere. This group isreferred to as a sub-sequence. 1.1 Sub-SequenceOperational Element R1-2.6 Calculating Theoretical Production Time PerUnit  Any element sequence may be modeled as anactivity-on-node network derived from precedenceconstraints on the operational elements and precedenceconstraints on the allocation of equipment resources tothe elements. Using the network model, the duration ofthe element sequence is simply the duration of thecritical path through the network.R1-2.6.1 Theoretical production time per unit is thenthe theoretical duration for the element sequencedivided by the number of units processed during thesequence.Theoretical Production Time Per Unit for recipe i \[THTi\]== (Theoretical Duration for the Element Sequence)/(Number of Units Processed During Sequence) R1-2.7 Allowances for Non-Steady-State Processing For complicated batch-load equipment models, it isuseful to divide resource sequences into a beginningphase, a steady-state-phase, and an ending phase. Formodeling theoretical time, it is important to determinewhat allowances to make, if any, for the beginning andending phases. For machines that are limited in thenumber of lots that can be processed in a continuouscascade, appropriate allowances shall be made forbeginning and ending phases. However, for machinesthat are capable of running continuously, the beginningand ending phases should not be considered indetermining theoretical production time.R1-2.7.1 Under certain conditions, setup typeoperations that are not tracked as part of downtime shallbe considered as part of the theoretical resourcesequence for a tool. These conditions includeoperations that shall occur in every machine cycle, e.g.recipe download, as well as operations that occur onother regular intervals, e.g., one clean cycle every 75wafers. In general, any activity that occurs onpredictable intervals and is a necessary part of a recipespecification should be considered in the equipmentsequence for determining theoretical production time.R1-2.7.2 Operations that occur at irregular intervals orthat apply to an unpredictable quantity of wafers, lots,or loads are not counted. An example of anunpredictable frequency setup is a recipe changeover,when the machine is changed from the requirements ofone process recipe to meet the needs of another, e.g., aspecies change as on an ion implant system. The idealfrequency of these events is taken as zero. R1-2.8 Optimality  Theoretical sequences shall bedesigned so as to optimize equipment throughput byusing only the best configuration of elements and anoptimal load size. Optimal sequences may differ fordifferent recipes performed on the same machine.Optimal load sizes are not necessarily maximum loadsizes.R1-2.9 Error-Checking Element Sequences  Once atheoretical sequence is specified for a piece ofequipment, it can be compared against actual equipmentoperations to check for errors. If discrepancies arefound, three possibilities to investigate are: The sequence contains extraneous elements. The sequence is missing necessary elements. The series and parallel relationships betweenelements are not correctly specified.R1-2.9.1 What may at first appear to be sequencespecification errors may in fact be undiscovered rateefficiency losses embedded in the equipment sequence.Because sequences are fundamental to overallperformance, it is important to rule out sequencespecification errors to preclude erroneous assignment ofrate efficiency losses to individual elements.R1-2.10 Example Resource Utilization Sequence  Anexample of a resource utilization sequence is given inFigure R1-1. This example represents a particularinstance of a photolithography stepper that exposespatterns from a reticle onto a wafer. This exampleassumes that the stepper receives individual unexposedwafers from a linked coat track and transfers individualexposed wafers to a linked develop track.R1-2.10.1 First, a reticle box shall be loaded into thestepper reticle handling system (load box). Before awafer may be exposed, the reticle shall be set andaligned. A wafer shall also be loaded onto the pre-alignchuck, pre-aligned, and transferred to the exposurestage. Each wafer is exposed then transferred to a postprocessing relay chuck. The transfer operationsimultaneously removes an exposed wafer and replacesit with an unexposed wafer.R1-2.10.2 The expose operation is represented by thesub-sequence shown in Figure R1-2. Depending on therecipe to be executed, the expose sub-sequence mayconsist of several different reticle images requiringchanges of blade positioning. For each image, there isone align operation. For each individual exposure,there is a step operation, a level operation, and theexpose operation itself. Within the same image,different exposures may require different levelingtimes, as well as different stepping times.

If the stepper is capable of processing wafersof the same reticle indefinitely, then the beginningphase is not included in theoretical production time. If,however, there is a hardware and/or software limit tothe number of wafers that may be run consecutively,then the beginning phase shall be counted in theoreticalproduction time. R1-3 Modeling Theoretical Durations forOperational ElementsR1-3.1 Once a theoretical equipment sequence isdefined, the next step is to measure and/or modeltheoretical durations for each operational element in thesequence. As a rule, it is preferable to acknowledge inthe model an elemental speed loss that can never berecovered in lieu of inadvertently overlooking anotherloss that could be reduced or eliminated.R1-3.2 Legitimate Observations  Each theoreticalelement duration should always be less than or equal toany legitimate observation for that element, where alegitimate observation is a traceable instance of anoperational element that does not result in a loss ofquality. The time for any legitimate observation that isless than the existing theoretical element durationshould become the new theoretical element duration.For legitimate instances of the same operationalelement on different instances of identically configured equipment, the best time observed among all equipmentof that type should be used as the theoretical elementduration.R1-3.3 Basis for Theoretical Element Durations Theoretical element durations may be based on timestudies, nominal parameters, and/or parametricmodeling.R1-3.3.1 Time Studies  Most mechanical operationalelements that have fixed execution times, like transportand load lock operations, can be accurately determinedby time studies using either stopwatches, equipmentdata acquisition systems, timing systems built into theequipment, or stand-alone data acquisition systems thatuse sensors to detect equipment events and/or statechanges.R1-3.3.1.1 When it is difficult to directly measureindividual elements, collections of elements may beobserved and timed instead. On systems where anumber of consecutive identical elements occur too fastto be measured individually, a set of elements should betimed, and the time should be divided by the number ofelements in the set. For even more complicatedsituations, element times may be derived algebraicallyfrom observations of several linearly independent setsof operational elements.R1-3.3.2 Nominal Parameters  There are instanceswhere it is desirable to use nominal parameters torepresent theoretical conditions rather than using directobservations, such as when:

&lt;!-- Page 37 --&gt;

SEMI E79-0304 © SEMI 1999, 200421  Nominal parameters are more representative of thephysical systems being studied. Nominal parameters are more representative of thedesired system performance. It is not practical to obtain reliable data.R1-3.3.3 Parametric Models  For cases where thetime for an operational element may have a range ofvalues that are dependent on recipe specifications,theoretical time is best represented by a parametricmodel. Parametric models for representingsemiconductor operations may be based on mathematical formulas, e.g., implant time versus beamcurrent, and/or lookup tables, e.g., best observed etchtime vs. etch end point.R1-3.3.3.1 For the photolithography example, one ofthe recipe parameters is the exposure energy (EE).Given the ideal or theoretical lamp intensity (LI) of thestepper, the theoretical duration per exposure (THTEX )for the recipe may be calculated as THTEX = EE / LI .

SEMI E79-0304 © SEMI 1999, 2004 22 RELATED INFORMATION 2RAPID CHARACTERIZATION OF INTRINSIC EQUIPMENT EFFICIENCY(IEE) AND THE PRODUCTIVITY EFFICIENCY PLANE NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E79. This related information was approved forpublication by vote of the responsible committee on December 15, 1999. R2-1 Rapid Characterization of IntrinsicEquipment EfficiencyR2-1.1 IEE may be rapidly characterized as followsusing a limited number of production experiments.R2-1.2 Step 1: Design Production Experiments Select a limited number of scenarios to execute asequipment experiments. It may be of interest tocharacterize IEE according to either operating modes,processing diversity, or a combination of operatingmodes and process diversity.R2-1.2.1 Determine the value-added in-processtheoretical production time per unit (VTHT)  (time perunit) for all recipes involved. This information isrequired for determining IEE. See Table A2-1.R2-1.2.2 For assessment of operating modes,experiments should examine only a single typical recipethat is likely to be used most frequently. Eachexperiment should examine a separate operating mode,where examples of various equipment operationalmodes may be as follows:One wafer at a time mode (production monitorwafer). One batch is run, then the tool stops.Two batches are run, then the tool stops.Three batches are run, then the tool stops. Continuous (cascade) mode. A larger number ofbatches is run, then the tool stops.R2-1.2.3 For assessment of process diversity, select alimited number of representative recipes that will beprocessed by a tool. This population should include atleast one recipe representing the minimum expectedprocessing duration and one representing the maximum.R2-1.2.4 Each experiment should be designed andexecuted to eliminate rate efficiency losses to thegreatest extent possible. It is further assumed thatquality efficiency losses are zero. Under thisapproximation, (VA-OEE) = (OEE)  (IEE). R2-1.3 Step 2: Execute Process Experiments Perform process experiments recording all relevantinput variables including the configuration of lots andwafers, and recipes. For each experiment, record theelapsed production time using convenient means, e.g.,stopwatch or existing data acquisition system.R2-1.4 Step 3: Calculate Results  Calculate IEE andthroughput for each experiment. IEE may be used tomeasure the effect of non-value-added overhead timeduring equipment processing. Approximately:Intrinsic Equipment Efficiency (IEE)= (Value-Added In-Process Theoretical Time)/(Non-Value-Added Overhead Time+ Value-Added In-Process Theoretical Time) R2-1.4.1 Hence, non-value-added overhead time foreach experiment may be calculated as:Non-Value-Added Overhead Time= \[(Production Time)- ( Value-Added In-Process Theoretical Time)\] R2-1.4.2 It should be the focus of efforts by theequipment supplier and the end-user to reduce oreliminate non-value-added overhead time throughimproved equipment design, including schedulingsoftware, as well as hardware components (carrier andwafer handling systems, valves, pumps, heaters,coolers, etc.).R2-1.4.3 Results may be shown in either tabular formor plotted graphically on a Productivity EffectivenessPlane. See Section R2-2.

Because theoretical production timeper unit may vary widely by recipe, good throughputperformance may not indicate correspondingly goodperformance in terms of overall equipment efficiency.Similarly, a high OEE score may not be indicative ofhigh throughput. Given this disparity, it is essential thatboth metrics be analyzed and compared as separateentities.R2-2.2 Data from rapid characterization experimentsmay be displayed graphically on a ProductivityEffectiveness Plane (PEP) diagram, Figure R2-1.R2-2.3 In PEP diagrams, IEE is plotted as a function ofthroughput. Points that appear further to the right havehigher throughput and points that appear higher up havehigher IEE. It is desired to have combined equipmentand process designs whose performance would appearin the upper right quadrant of the plane for the entireoperating range of the tool.R2-2.4 The four experimental data points from thesample problem are plotted in Figure R2-1 and, whenconnected, appear to approximate an upward slopingcurve. This curve is referred to as a tool signature.R2-2.5 Tool signatures may be used to describe toolperformance relative to isolated variables. Thisrepresentation helps equipment suppliers and usersvisualize the effects of tool operating modes on IEE andthroughput. For more complex multi-dimensionalexperiment sets, the tool signature would appear as ahyper-surface.R2-2.6 OEE can be plotted for comparison against toolsignatures. In Figure R2-1, an OEE measurement of atypical week is plotted. For the known throughputcorresponding to this OEE score, the value of IEE onthe tool signature for the same throughput may be usedto approximate the IEE score for the week withoutcalculating IEE explicitly.

SEMI E80-0299 (Reapproved 1104)TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING ATTITUDE SENSITIVITY OF MASSFLOW CONTROLLERS (MOUNTING POSITION) This test method was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility ofthe North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on July 11, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to be publishedNovember 2004. Originally published in 1999; last published November 2004. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this test method is to provide astandardized method for quantifying the effect ofmounting attitude on an MFC.1.2 This document provides a common basis forcommunication between manufacturers and usersregarding testing and describing MFC mounting effects. 2 Scope2.1 This procedure describes a method to determine theeffect of attitude (mounting position) of a Mass FlowController on flow span and zero.2.2 The intent of this document is not to suggest anyspecific testing program but to specify the test methodto be used when testing for parameters covered by thismethod. Reference operating conditions represent theenvironmental conditions where the "best" performancecan be expected.2.3 The minimum test described in this document is totest one MFC in 5 common mounting positions usingNitrogen gas at 135.8 kPa (19.7 psia) and 308 kPa (44.7psia). This test method can be used to evaluateadditional gases, pressures or mounting attitudes.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 It is not practical to evaluate performance under allpossible combinations of operating conditions. This testprocedure should be applied under laboratory(reference) conditions; its intent is to collect sufficientdata to form a judgment of the field performance of theMFC being tested.3.2 The results from this test represent the performanceof the specific device tested i.e., make, model, full scaleflow and operating conditions. The results may notapply to devices of different manufacture, model, fullscale flow or under different operating conditions. 3.3 Due to manufacturing variability, attitudesensitivity may vary for the same model of MFC. Tostatistically quantify attitude sensitivity for a particularmodel of MFC, multiple samples should be tested. 4 Referenced StandardsNone. 5 Terminology5.1 Acronyms and Abbreviations5.1.1 % F.S.

This data is reduced to quantifythe relationship between the flow control by the MFCand its relationship to the attitude of the MFC.6.2 This method allows the user to determine the effectof different mounting attitudes on MFC zero and span.6.3 The standard test is determining the effect ofchanging between attitudes 1 and 2 on Nitrogen. Othertypical MFC attitudes and gases may also be tested (seeFigure 1). 7 Interferences7.1 The accuracy rating of the measuring equipmentshall be superior to that of the DUT. Preferably, themeasuring equipment will have an accuracy that is fourtimes better than the DUT. Calibration equipment musthave a valid calibration certificate.7.2 Take care when using test instruments with aspecified accuracy expressed in percent of full scale. 7.3 Installation effects on the flow should beminimized. Monitor pressure upstream of the DUT toensure that flow variations due to pressure areminimized.7.4 Verify electrical signals directly at the DUTconnector to ensure that the signals at the DUT andstandard agree with the signals at the data recordingequipment.7.5 All electrical measurements should be read ondevices with at least 4.5 digits of resolution. Thesedevices must have valid calibration certifications.7.6 All instrumentation in the test apparatus mustremain in a constant orientation except the device undertest. 8 Significance and Use8.1 The data generated by this method is used toestimate the effect-mounting attitude will have on theperformance of a mass flow controller. It wouldtypically be used to estimate the potential flow errorcaused by using an MFC in attitude, other than the oneit was calibrated for. 9 Apparatus (see Figure 2)9.1 Flow Standard  A device or system thataccurately measures the flow and reports the actualflow.9.2 Data Acquisition System  The system thatmeasures the electrical signals from the device undertest.
