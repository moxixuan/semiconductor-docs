It can also be used as a\nguide   to   evaluate   process   modifications   to   such\nsystems. This guideline is intended to be applicable for\nphoto, DUV, x-ray, and electron beam processes.\n2  Background\nRelease   of   the   information   in   this   document   was\napproved  by  the  SEMI  Photolithographic  Chemicals\nCommittee   (Resist   Committee)   in   May   1987.   This\ncommittee plans to complete and revise the guideline as\nappropriate. Comments will be welcomed.\n3  Scope\nVirtually  all  lithographic  fabrication  processes  vary  in\nsome  way  from  location  to  location,  even  for  the  same\ntype of resist. Consequently, it is impossible to provide\na stringent evaluation program acceptable to most users.\nIt  is,  therefore,  the  aim  of  this  guideline  to  provide  a\nprogram  of  tests  and  methods  that  allows  variable,  but\ncontrolled,  process  differences.  In  order  to  maintain  a\nproper baseline control for each process, all tests should\nbe run relative to some internal standard product whose\nfunctional  characteristics  are  known  and  characterized.\nIt is understood that each product is to be run at its own\npreferred or recommended conditions and that different\nproducts maybe evaluated under different conditions. It\nshould   also   be   understood   that   some   properties,\nvariables, or conditions, such as normality, are specific\nto resist type, such as positive photoresist, and are to be\nused only where applicable. Further, since this guide is\ndirected  to  functional  testing,  it  is  assumed  that  any\nproducts   to   be   evaluated   have   passed   all   relevant\nchemical  and  physical  testing  before  such  functional\ntesting.\n4  Priorities\nThis   guideline   has   been   divided   into   two   separate\ngroups.   The   first   group,   called   \u201cSustaining   Tests,\u201d\nincludes tests that are necessary for timely adjustments\nto coating and exposure conditions in order to maintain\nconsistent  image  dimensions  (Tables  1\u20133).  The  second\ngroup, called \u201cExtended Testing,\u201d includes tests that are\nrequired for full evaluation of the resist system (Tables\n4\u20136).  These  tests  may,  or  may  not,  be  necessary  for\nevaluation  of  each  lot  of  product,  depending  on  the\nindividual requirements of the user.\n5  Referenced Documents\n5. 1  ASTM

After a poll  of  the  active  task  force\nmembers, a tentative recommendation will be posted on the SEMI P10 task force web site at SEMI so that all users\ncan adopt a common interim solution until a formal ballot can officially resolve the issue.\n6. 26  Every effort should be made to construct a SEMI P10 file without inconsistencies or ambiguities.  If a vendor\ndetects  such  flaws  in  a  file  from  a  customer,  the  vendor  should  contact  the  customer  to  correct  the  inconsistencies\nand/or remove the ambiguities before proceeding with making the mask.\n7  Syntax Specification\nThe following specifies the syntax for the mask order structures. The record order is specific; records must appear in\nthe sequence shown. Terminology for the individual records and their allowed data values are specified in \xa78.\n7. 1  Syntax  Symbol  Definition  \u2014  The  lower  case  syntactic  names  within  <  >  are  used  to  refer  to  collections  of\nrecords.  The  use  of  {  }  around  records  or  collections  of  records  means  an  arbitrary  number  of  repetitions  of  the\nrecords,  including  none  at  all.  The  use  of  ","[  ]","  around  a  record  or  collection  of  records  means  that  the  collection  is\noptional.\n7. 2  Record Syntax \u23af A keyword is followed by a data field which is followed by an optional comment. The record\nis terminated by a carriage return and/or linefeed. Each of these elements may be preceded by any combination of\nspaces  or  tabs,  which  will  be  ignored.  At  least  one  space  or  tab  is  required  preceding  the  first  data  value  in  the\nrecord.  An  exclamation  point  (!)  is  required  to  initiate  a  comment.  Exclamation  points,  carriage  returns,  and\nlinefeeds are not allowed in keywords, data values or comments. Note that a record consisting of a comment only is\nalso allowed. The syntax for individual records is defined as:\nrecord = ","[{separator} keyword\nseparator {separator} data_field][{separator} ! comment]","\n{separator} new_line\nwhere \u201cseparator\u201d is a space or a tab, \u201ccomment\u201d is any string of printable ASCII characters (plus spaces and tabs),\nand \u201cnew_line\u201d is a carriage return, linefeed or both.\n7. 3  Multi-value  Data  Field  Syntax  \u2014  When  data_field  contains  more  than  one  data_value,  such  as  (x,y)  pairs  or\n(x1,y1,x2,y2)  double  pairs  (see  \xa78),  the  individual  values  must  be  separated  by  a  comma  and  any  combination  of\nspaces  or  tabs.  One  comma  is  required  between  each  data_value,  but  not  more  than  one  comma.  Two  commas\nwithout an intervening data value are not permissible.\n(x,y) = data_value {separator} comma {separator} data_value\n(x,y,z) = (x,y) {separator} comma {separator} (z)\n(x1,y1,x2,y2) = (x1,y1) {separator} comma {separator} (x2,y2)\n(x,y,x1,y1,x2,y2) = (x,y) {separator} comma {separator} (x1,y1,x2,y2)\nFor data manipulation operations only, a semicolon separates layers from its datatype, and a dash indicates a range\nof layers or a range of datatypes.\nlayer1;datatype6 , layer3-layer4;datatype1-datatype9"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI P10-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1990, 2005 5\n7. 4  Mask
