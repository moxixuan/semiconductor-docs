All required convex features may also have a radius of up to r66 to prevent small\ncontact patches with large stresses that might cause wear and particles.\nNOTE 4:  These  limits  on  the  radius  of  all  required  features  are  specified  as  a  maximum  (not  a  minimum)  to  ensure  that  the\nrequired features are not rounded off too much.  The lower bound on the radius is up to the carrier supplier.\nNOTE 5:  This radius applies to every required feature unless another radius is called out specifically.  Here a required feature is\nan area on the surface of the carrier specified by a dimension (or intersections of dimensions) that has a tolerance and not just a\nmaximum or minimum (such as the edges of the robotic handling flange).\n6. 14  Info Pads \u2014 When the RSP is placed on a port, the info pads A, B, C, and D communicate information about\nthe RSP configuration.

These  surfaces  are  shown  in  Figures  8  and  9  with  dimensions  given  in\nTable 2.  The contact surfaces are defined by x245, x246, y233, y234 and y235.\n6. 6  Reticle  Capture  \u2014  When  the  carrier  is  closed,  a  bisecting  plane  through  the  reticle,  parallel  to  the  bilateral\nreference plane must be within x114 of the bilateral reference plane of the load port when the reticle is seated in the\ncarrier.  A bisecting plane through the reticle, parallel to the facial reference plane must be within y228 of the facial\nreference plane of the load port when the reticle is seated in the carrier.\n6. 7  Exclusion Volumes \u2014 The interior of the MRSP150 must never intrude into the pellicle exclusion volume, and\nmust  not  intrude  into  the  end-effector  exclusion  volumes,  lift  clearance  exclusion  volumes  or  safety  rail  exclusion\nvolumes when the carrier is open.\n6. 7.1  End-Effector  Exclusion  Volumes  \u2014  Volumes  in  an  opened  pod  which  must  be  free  for  the  end-effector  to\nenter  and  handle  the  reticle  as  defined  by  x238, x239, x240, y227, y232, y238, z297, z299, z302  (first  reticle)  and\nz300  (second  through  sixth  reticle).

Table  2  defines  the\ninternal dimensions of the MRSP150.\n6. 10  Robotic  Handling  Flange  \u2014  On  the  top  of  the  pod  is  an  optional  robotic  handling  flange  for  automated\nmanipulation of the MRSP150.  Figures 1, 3 and 5 show dimensions for the robotic handling flange. Table 2 defines\nthe dimensions for the robotic handling flange.\n6. 11  Recess \u2014 Surface on the top of the pod defined by dimensions x100, y106  and  z281.    Figures  1  and  3  show\ndimension for the recess.  The recess provides clearance for use of robotic handling flange.\nNOTE 3:  The raised surface around the recess is not required.\n6. 12  Side Handling Flanges \u2014 On the sides of the pod parallel to the bilateral reference plane are optional handling\nflanges  for  automated  manipulation  of  the  MRSP150.    Figures  1,  2  and  3  show  dimensions  for  the  side  handling\nflanges. Table 2 defines the dimensions for the side handling flanges. No obstructions may exist in the side handling\nexclusion  volumes  which  extend  in  the  y  direction  (normal  to  the  facial  reference  plane)  as  defined  by  x236  and\nz286.\n6. 13  Conveyor  Rails  \u2014  Surfaces  on  the  bottom  of  the  MRSP150  used  to  transport  the  MRSP  on  conveyors.    The\nrails  consist  of  smooth  portions  of  the  bottom  periphery,  parallel  with  each  other,  on  two  opposite  sides,  and\nextending at least y236 from the facial reference plane (optionally the full length) on those sides.  Surfaces on these\nportions of the bottom periphery should be uninterrupted (ie. no notches in the surface along the bottom or the side).\nNo  other  feature  of  the  carrier  may  extend  below  the  plane  defined  by  the  surfaces  of  the  conveyor  rails.  The\nconveyor rail surfaces are bounded by x247, x248 and y236 as shown in Figure 10.  Table 2 defines the dimensions\nfor the conveyor rails.\n6. 14  Inner and Outer Radii \u2014 All required concave features may have a radius of up to r65 to allow cleaning and\nto prevent contaminant build-up.  All required convex features may also have a radius of up to r66 to prevent small\ncontact patches with large stresses that might cause wear and particles.\nNOTE 4:  These  limits  on  the  radius  of  all  required  features  are  specified  as  a  maximum  (not  a  minimum)  to  ensure  that  the\nrequired features are not rounded off too much.  The lower bound on the radius is up to the carrier supplier.\nNOTE 5:  This radius applies to every required feature unless another radius is called out specifically.  Here a required feature is\nan area on the surface of the carrier specified by a dimension (or intersections of dimensions) that has a tolerance and not just a\nmaximum or minimum (such as the edges of the robotic handling flange)."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E112-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2001, 2005 5\n6. 15  Info  Pads  \u2014  When  the  MRSP  is  placed  on  a  port,  the  info  pads  A,  B,  C,  and  D  communicate  information\nabout  the  RSP  configuration.

The\ntransformation   is   achieved   by   the   use   of   various\nreactive  components,  such  as  capacitors  and  inductors,\nthat  \u201ctune\u201d  the  matching  network  by  transforming  the\nimpedance  at  the  output  of  the  network  to  the  input  of\nthe matching network.  For a given frequency, there is a\nfixed relationship between the impedance at the input of\nthe  matching  network  and  the  impedance  at  the  output\nof the matching network (the load impedance).  In other\nwords, the impedance to which the matching network is\nmatched (the load impedance) can be determined if the\ntransform  properties  of  the  network  are  known  for  a\ngiven  frequency.    Typically,  there  are  two  methods  of\nimpedance  transformation.    The  first  method  uses  a\nfixed  frequency  (e.g.,  13.56  MHz)  and  variable  tuning\nelements,  while  the  second  method  uses  a  variable\nfrequency and fixed tuning elements.  Specifications for\nboth  methods  are  given  below.    SEMI  E115  or  an\nequivalent test method(s) shall be used to determine the\nload  impedance  and  efficiency  of  matching  networks\nthat  are  designed  to  operate  at  fixed  frequency  with  a\n50-ohm input impedance.\n7. 4.2  For   those   systems   that   use   fixed   frequency\noperation,   matching   networks   typically   have   two\nvariable  tuning  elements,  which  are  usually  variable\ncapacitors  and/or  inductors.    These  variable  tuning\nelements  typically  have  an  output  voltage  or  encoder\nvalue that corresponds to a certain value of the element\n(i.e.,  an  output  voltage  will  correspond  to  a  specific\nvalue  of  capacitance  or  inductance  in  the  matching\nnetwork).    The  value  of  the  output  voltage  or  encoder\nvalue  is  referred  to  as  the  tuning  element  position.    To\nobtain information on the operation and performance of\nthe  matching  network,  the  tuning  element  positions\nmust be provided as outputs.\n7. 4.3  For  those  systems  that  use  variable  frequency\noperation,   matching   networks   typically   have   fixed\ntuning  elements  (no  variation)  or  tap  points  between\nfixed  tuning  elements,  and  the  frequency  is  varied  to\nobtain  the  best  matched  condition.    In  some  cases,  the\ntap  points  are  also  varied  for  matching.    To  obtain\ninformation  on  the  operation  and  performance  of  these\ntypes  of  networks,  the  operating  frequency  and  the\ninput  impedance  (or  reflection  coefficient  magnitude\nand  phase  angle)  shall  be  provided.    For  those  systems\nthat have variable tap points, the tap point position shall\nalso be provided as an output.\n7. 4.4  For  matching  networks  run  at  a  fixed  frequency\nwith variable tuning elements, the load impedance shall\nbe   provided   as   a   function   of   the   tuning   element\npositions.    In  addition,  the  efficiency  of  the  matching\nnetwork  shall  be  provided  as  a  function  of  the  tuning\nelement positions.  The information shall be provided in\ntabular  form.

For  example,  a  voltage  increment  of  1\nvolt  or  less  shall  be  used  in  the  case  where  the  full\nrange of the tuning element position is 10 volts.  A plot\nproviding  an  example  of  the  real  part  of  the  load\ntransformed  to  50  ohms  by  the  matching  network  as  a\nfunction  of  tuning  element  position  indicator  is  shown\nin  Figure  1  and  a  plot  of  the  reactive  part  of  the  load\nimpedance  is  shown  in  Figure  2.

It is the reciprocal of the square\nroot  of  the  relative  dielectric  constant  of  the  dielectric\nmaterial  between  the  inner  and  outer  conductor  of  a\ncoaxial  assembly.

These  cable  assemblies,  which  should\nnot be confused with the DUT cable assembly, shall be\nof  the  same  nominal  characteristic  impedance  as  the\nDUT  cable  assembly.

One  method\nmeasures  it  directly  at  the  operating  frequency  and  the\nother  measures  the  half-wave  resonant  frequency  to\ndetermine   the   electrical   length.      Each   method   has\nadvantages,   depending   on   the   length   of   the   cable\nassembly.    Prior  to  choosing  a  method,  the  equivalent\nfree-space length of the DUT shall be estimated in units\nof distance (i.e., meters).  This length can be estimated\nby  dividing  the  physical  length  of  the  DUT  by  the\nvelocity of propagation for the particular type of cable.\nFor  example,  a  DUT  made  from  RG-217  cable  with  a\nphysical   length   of   20   meters   and   a   velocity   of\npropagation  of  0.66  would  have  an  equivalent  free-\nspace  length  of  30.303  meters  (20/0.66  =  30.303).    A\nflow  chart  showing  the  steps  for  choosing  which  test\nmethod to use is shown in Figure 2.\n9. 2    The  equivalent  free-space  length  of  the  DUT  shall\nbe   compared   with   the   wavelength   of   the   nominal\noperating frequency.  Test Method 1 (Section 9.3) shall\nbe used if the equivalent free-space length is less than a\nquarter wavelength of the nominal operating frequency.\nTest  Method  2  shall  be  used  if  it  is  equal  to  or  greater\nthan  a  quarter  wavelength  of  the  nominal  operating\nfrequency.    For  example,  if  the  estimated  free-space\nlength is 3 meters and the nominal operating frequency\nis  13.56  MHz  (quarter  wavelength  =  0.25  \xd7 c/13.56 \xd7\n10\n6\n=    5.527    meters),    then    Test    Method    1    is\nrecommended.  If the estimated free-space length is 25\nmeters, then Test Method 2 is recommended.\n9. 3  Test Method 1 for Determining Electrical Length\n9. 3.1  This test method measures the phase angle of the\nreflection    coefficient    at    the    nominal    operating\nfrequency of the DUT when the DUT is terminated by a\nshort circuit.\n9. 3.2    Calibrate  the  Network  Analyzer  at  the  desired\noperating frequency (e.g., 13.56 MHz).  If adapters are\nto be used to connect the DUT to the Network Analyzer\nand/or   to   the   short   circuit   termination,   then   the\ncalibration  shall  be  made  with  the  adapters  in  place.\nThe    Network    Analyzer    shall    be    calibrated    for\nmeasuring  the  reflection  coefficient  at  test  Port  1  (see\nFigure  1)  using  the  calibration  kit  provided  with  the\nNetwork  Analyzer.    This  measurement  is  equivalent  to\nmeasuring  the  S11  S-parameter.    The  calibration  shall\nbe   performed   at   fixed   frequency   (continuous-wave\noperation)    using    the    lowest    bandwidth    possible\n(typically 10 Hz).\n9. 3.3  After calibration, the cable assembly to be tested\n(DUT)  shall  be  attached  to  Port  1  on  the  Network\nAnalyzer.      The   other   end   of   the   DUT   shall   be\nterminated  with  a  short  circuit.    After  all  connections\nhave  been  visually  inspected  to  ensure  proper  contact\nand the Network Analyzer measurement has stabilized,\nthe  value  of  the  reflection  coefficient  phase  angle  shall\nbe recorded.\n9. 3.4    If  the  indicated  phase  angle  of  the  reflection\ncoefficient  is  positive,  then  the  electrical  length  of  the\nDUT is equal to one half of the value of the difference\nbetween   180   and   the   measured   phase   angle.      For\nexample,  if  the  measure  reflection  coefficient  phase\nangle  is  120  degrees,  then  the  electrical  length  is  30\ndegrees ((180-120)/2).\n9. 3.5    If  the  indicated  phase  angle  of  the  reflection\ncoefficient  is  negative,  then  the  electrical  length  of  the\nDUT  is  greater  than  a  quarter  wavelength.    For  this\ncase,  the  electrical  length  is  equal  to  one  half  of  the\nabsolute  value  of  the  measured  value  of  the  reflection\ncoefficient  phase  angle  plus  90.    For  example,  if  the\nmeasure   reflection   coefficient   phase   angle   is   -10\ndegrees,  then  the  electrical  length  is  95  degrees  (90  +\n10/2).\n9. 4  Test Method 2 for Determining Electrical Length\n9. 4.1    This  test  method  determines  the  electrical  length\nof the cable assembly DUT by measuring the half wave\nresonant  frequency  when  the  DUT  is  terminated  by  a\nshort  circuit.    For  this  measurement,  the  frequency  of\nthe network analyzer is swept.  The frequency range of\nthe  sweep  is  determined  from  the  estimated  free-space\nlength of the DUT.\n9. 4.2  Estimate the half wave resonant frequency of the\nDUT.  This frequency is equal to one half of the ratio of\nthe  speed  of  light  divided  by  the  estimated  free  space\nlength  determined  in  Section  9.2.    For  example,  if  the\nestimated  free  space  length  of  the  DUT  is  25  meters,\nthen  the  estimated  half  wave  resonant  frequency  is\n5. 996 MHz (0.5 \xd7 c/25).\n9. 4.3    Calibrate  the  Network  Analyzer.  If  adapters  are\nto be used to connect the DUT to the Network Analyzer\nand/or   to   the   short   circuit   termination,   then   the\ncalibration  shall  be  made  with  the  adapters  in  place.\nThe center frequency of the frequency sweep shall be at\nthe  estimated  half  wave  resonant  frequency  calculated\nin  Section  9.4.2,  and  the  frequency  span  of  the  sweep\nshall   be   no   greater   than   10%   of   the   estimated\nfrequency.    For  example,  if  the  estimated  half  wave\nresonant frequency is 6.0 MHz, then the frequency span\nshall  be  no  greater  than  0.6  MHz.    The  Network\nAnalyzer    shall    be    calibrated    for    measuring    the\nreflection coefficient at test Port 1 (see Figure 1) using\nthe calibration kit provided with the Network Analyzer.\nThis  measurement  is  equivalent  to  measuring  the  S11\nS-parameter.    The  calibration  shall  be  performed  using\nthe lowest bandwidth possible (typically 10 Hz)."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E114-0302\nE\n\xa9 SEMI 2002 4\n9. 4.4  After calibration, the cable assembly to be tested\n(DUT)  shall  be  attached  to  Port  1  on  the  Network\nAnalyzer.

A\nschematic of the Test Setup is shown in Figure 3.\n11  Test Procedure for Determining Power\nDissipation\n11. 1        The    test    procedure    for    determining    power\ndissipation in cable assemblies will also use a Network\nAnalyzer.    In  this  case,  both  Ports  of  the  Network\nAnalyzer  will  be  used.    The  transmission  coefficient\nwill be measured (also called the S21 S-parameter).\n11. 2    Calibrate  the  Network  Analyzer  at  the  desired\noperating  frequency  (for  example,  13.56  MHz).    If\nadapters  are  to  be  used  to  connect  the  DUT  to  the\nNetwork    Analyzer    and/or    to    the    short    circuit\ntermination, then the calibration shall be made with the\nadapters  in  place,  along  with  the  additional  section  of\ntest  cable  needed  for  the  calibration.
