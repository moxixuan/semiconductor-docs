A simple handshake is achieved which provides for a variety oferror conditions which gracefully terminate the handshake. Separate messages advise the host of errors andcompleted material transfers.10.8.1.1 Since the handshake and host messages are separate, the handshake may be achieved transparently throughthe host or by direct connection between equipment. The host completes the handshake by relaying messagesbetween the equipment. Only a single port is required on the equipment, and the equipment has a simple messagehandling requirement. When a direct connection is desired, at least three ports are required, the receiving equipmentmust look like the host with respect to the sending equipment, and message handling in the equipment issignificantly more complicated than in the host-only connection. Nevertheless, the direct connection may still bechosen in an attempt to provide operation without a host. Since the host is reasonably transparent in the materialhandshake, a simple explanation of the handshake may be achieved by just considering the exchange of messagesbetween the sender, the equipment wanting to get rid of material, and the receiver (the equipment able to accept thematerial).10.8.1.2 Figure 4 shows six possible handshake situations between the sender and the receiver. There are twonormal handshakes. Figure 4(a) shows the normal three-message exchange when material is passed betweenequipment. The host is informed of a complete transfer of material. Figure 4(b) shows an alternative messageexchange where the sender changes its mind and decides not to send the material. Figures 4(c) and (d) show twosituations where the material gets stuck during the transfer. In each situation an error message is issued to the hostfrom the equipment where the material is stuck. The other equipment terminates normally. When material is stuck,manual intervention is required to move the material towards the equipment which indicates the stuck condition.The manual intervention has two possible outcomes. One, the material can be moved to a position where thehandshake can resume or, two, the material is broken or lost from the transfer. Lost material causes a lost materialerror message to be sent to the host prior to resuming the operation. The specific details of recovering front stuckmaterial are equipment-dependent. The stuck material condition is determined by the amount of time the materialtransfer mechanism is turned on. The sender claims stuck material if the material is not clear of its sensor before atime t1. The receiver claims stuck material if the material is not received before time t2. Figures 4(e) and (f) showthe possible error conditions in the unlikely event that for some reason a handshake message is lost. Figure 4(e)shows that time t3 is the longest that the sender will wait for material received message. Times t2 and t3 set anupper limit on the amount of time either material transport mechanism will operate."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 8 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E5-1104 \xa9 SEMI 1982, 2004 100 Figure 4The Six Possible Handshakes 10.8.1.3 Figure 5 summarizes the interaction of the timers, handshake messages, and the error messages in the formof a flow chart.

Exceptions are classified into two categories: errors and alarms. Messages S5,F1 through S5,F8 of thissection provide basic alarm messages. The messages S5,F9 through S5,F18 provide extended capabilities forException Handling. When using messages F1F8, alarms may be divided into categories as follows:1. personal safety  Condition may be dangerous to people.2. equipment safety  Condition may harm equipment.3. parameter control warning  Parameter variation outside of preset limits  may harm product.4. parameter control error  Parameter variation outside of reasonable control limits  may indicate anequipment malfunction.5. irrecoverable error  Intervention required before normal use of equipment can resume.6. equipment status warning  An unexpected condition has occurred, but operation can continue.7. attention flags  A signal from a process program indicating that a particular step has been reached.8. data integrity  A condition which may cause loss of data; usually related to Stream 6.10.9.1 For messages F1 through F8, it will be the equipments responsibility to categorize the alarm. Some alarmconditions may cause more than one type of alarm to be issued. For example, a parameter control error on overtemperature may also trip a protective device that makes the alarm irrecoverable without some intervention.
