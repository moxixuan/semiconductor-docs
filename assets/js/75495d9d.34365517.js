It  was  derived  from\ninformation  developed  during  the  original  preparation  of  the  standard  in  ASTM  Committee  F-1  in  1994.\nThis related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures.\nR3-1   The  recombination  of  an  excess  electron-hole\npair at a defect center is a two-step process.  It involves\neither (\na) the capture of an electron in an empty defect\ncenter  followed  by  the  capture  of  a  hole  or  (\nb)  the\ncapture  of  a  hole  on  a  filled  defect  center  followed  by\nthe  capture  of  an  electron.    Thus,  the  recombination\ntime  depends  on  the  number  of  filled  or  empty  defect\ncenters as well as the capture time constants.\nR3-2   The occupancy of the defect centres is controlled\nby  the  position  of  the  Fermi  energy  as  discussed  by\nBlakemore.\n16\nIf all of the defect centers are empty, the\nelectron recombination time is governed by the electron\ncapture  time  constant,\n\u03c4\nn0\n;  this  occurs  when  the  Fermi\nenergy is well below the defect center energy.  If all of\nthe  defect  centers  are  filled,  the  hole  recombination\ntime is governed by the hole capture time constant,\n\u03c4\np0\n;\nthis  occurs  when  the  Fermi  energy  is  well  above  the\ndefect energy.  Since the position of the Fermi energy is\ngoverned    primarily    by    the    dopant    density,    the\noccupancy  of  the  defect  centers  may  be  different  for\ndifferent resistivity wafers.\nR3-3   There  are  two  sets  of  equivalent  cases.    The\ndefect  center  may  be  in  the  same  half  of  the  forbidden\ngap  as  the  Fermi  energy  or  it  may  be  in  the  other  half.\nThus, the case for the defect center in the lower half of\nthe gap of a\np-type semiconductor is the same as for the\ndefect  center  in  the  upper  half  of  the  gap  in  an\nn-type\nsemiconductor  with  the  roles  of  electrons  and  holes\ninterchanged.    Similarly,  the  case  for  the  defect  center\nin the upper half of the gap in a\np-type semiconductor is\nthe same as for the defect center in the lower half of the\ngap in an\nn-type semiconductor.\nR3-4   As   examples,   consider   the   three   cases   of\nelemental  iron  in  both\nn-  and  p-type  silicon  and  iron-\nboron  pairs  in\np-type  silicon  at  room  temperature  (300\nK).    In  each  case  the  iron  density  is  assumed  to  be\n5 \xd7 10\n11\natoms/cm\n3\n.  Note that at for very low resistivity\nwafers,  the  nondegeneracy  requirement  of  the  S-R-H\nmodel may be violated.\nR3-4.1\nElemental  Iron  in  p-Type  Silicon  (see  Figure\nR3-1)  \u2014  For  all  practical  values  of  resistivity,  the\nFermi  energy  lies  many\nkT  below  the  near  mid-gap\nenergy of the elemental iron center.  Consequently, the\ndefect  centers  are  empty  and  the  limiting  process  is\ncapture of excess minority electrons, there being ample\nnumbers of holes present to recombine with the electron\nimmediately  upon  its  capture  by  the  defect  center.\nTherefore,    the    small-signal    carrier    recombination\nlifetime   is   equal   to   the   electron   (minority-carrier)\ncapture time constant:\n\u03c4\n0\n= \u03c4\nn0\n.\nR3-4.2\nElemental  Iron  in  n-type  Silicon  (see  Figure\nR3-2)  \u2014  In  this  case,  for  all  values  of  resistivity,  the\nFermi energy is very far above the defect center energy\nand all the defect centers are filled, and hole capture is\ngoverned   by   the   hole   capture   time   constant,\n\u03c4\np0\n.\nBecause  the  Fermi  energy  is  close  to  the  conduction\nband edge, there are large numbers of electrons present\nso that as soon as a hole is captured, the defect center is\nfilled  again.    Therefore,  hole  capture  is  the  limiting\nprocess,   and   the   small-signal   carrier   recombination\nlifetime  is  equal  to  the  hole  (minority-carrier)  capture\ntime constant:\n\u03c4\n0\n= \u03c4\np0\n.\nR3-4.3\nIron-Boron  Pairs  in  p-Type  (Boron-Doped)\nSilicon\n(see  Figure  R3-3)  \u2014  This  defect  center  is\nlocated quite close to the valence band edge.  For all but\nvery low resistivity wafers, the Fermi energy lies above\nthe  defect  center  energy  so  that  some  of  the  defect\ncenters  are  filled.    In  this  case,  the  capture  of  minority\nelectrons  is  still  the  limiting  process,  but  since  only  a\nfraction  of  the  sites  can  capture  an  electron,  the  small-\nsignal recombination lifetime is larger than the electron\ncapture time constant.  Quantitatively, because\nn\n0\n<< p\n0\n,\nthe  small-signal  carrier  recombination  lifetime  is  given\nby\n\u03c4\n0\n= \u03c4\nn0\n(p\n1\n/p\n0\n).\nR3-4.4    The  fourth  possible  case  is  one  in  which  the\ndefect  center  is  located  near  valence  band  edge  in\nn-\ntype  material.    The  iron-boron  pair,  of  course,  cannot\nexist  in\nn-type  material;  however,  for  the  case  of  a\nhypothetical defect center with energy near the valence\nband  in\nn-type  material,  \u03c4\nn0\np\n1"),(0,i.yg)("blockquote",null,(0,i.yg)("blockquote",{parentName:"blockquote"},(0,i.yg)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"}," \u03c4\np0\nn\n0\nfor  all  but  the\nmost heavily doped material so this term dominates the\nsmall-signal lifetime and the minority-carrier properties\ndo not influence the recombination process.\nR3-5   Thus,  for  deep  lying  defect  centers,  the  low-\ninjection (small-signal) carrier recombination lifetime is\nequal  to  the  minority-carrier  capture  time  constant  (or\nminority-carrier lifetime), while for centers close to the\nband   edge,   the   small-signal   carrier   recombination\nlifetime  can  be  much  larger  than  the  minority-carrier\ncapture time constant."))),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1535-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2004 16\nFigure R3-3\nLow-Injection Recombination Lifetime (solid curve)\nas a Function of Resistivity for Iron-Boron Pairs in\np-Type Silicon at Room Temperature\nFigure R3-2\nLow-In\njection Recombination Lifetime (solid\ncurve) as a Function of Resistivity for\nElemental Iron in n-Type Silicon at Room\nTemperature\nFigure R3-1\nLow-In\njection Recombination Lifetime (solid\ncurve) as a Function of Resistivity for\nElemental Iron in p-Type Silicon at Room\nTemperature"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for any\nparticular  application.

This   practice\ndescribes  measurement  site  patterns  and  determination\nof their spatial coordinates on the wafer, as well as the\nstatistics  to  be  used  when  reducing  the  measurement\ndata to determine uniformity.  For each of the sampling\nplans, the exact number of measurement sites is chosen\nbased  on  the  size  of  the  wafer  being  used,  the  desired\nspatial  resolution  of  the  measurement  instrument,  and\nwhether   maximal,   or   somewhat   lesser   information\ndensity  is  desired.

This  practice  does  not  itself  contain  details  on\nperforming any specific measurement.\n2. 5.1  Not  all  types  of  measurements  that  may  need  to\nbe  used  for  evaluation  of  the  uniformity  of  a  thin  film\nhave   formal   procedural   standards.      SEMI   MF374,\nSEMI  MF576,  SEMI  MF1392,  SEMI  MF1393,  and\nSEMI MF1529 give details of measurement procedures\nthat may be applied to evaluating the uniformity of thin\nfilm properties.\n2. 5.2  This  practice  does  not  deal  with  acquisition  or\nanalysis  of  uniformity  data  where  it  is  desired  to  take\nmore  than  one  measurement  per  specified  spatial  cell\nsuch   as   is   commonly   done   for   wafer   site   flatness\nmeasurements.\n2. 6  This practice makes no recommendations regarding\nthe   interpretation   of   the   statistics   that   result   from\nanalysis   of   the   data   acquired   with   regard   to   the\ngoodness or badness of given values of the test statistic,\nnor does it make recommendations regarding decisions\nabout  the  process  cycle  or  equipment  used  to  produce\nthe thin film that was measured.\n2. 7  The  principles  of  this  practice  may  be  adapted  to\ndetermine    the    uniformity    of    bulk    silicon    wafer\nproperties   such   as   interstitial   oxygen   content   and\nresistivity,  but  depending  on  the  desired  property  and\nthe  chosen  measurement  technique,  depth-dependent\nvariations may be misinterpreted as lateral variations.\nNOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address\nsafety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the\nresponsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish\nappropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine\nthe applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior\nto use.\n3  Limitations\n3. 1  This  practice  is  written  for  evaluation  of  planar  or\nblanket films, but it may be applied to patterned films if\nthe pattern size, shape, and distribution do not interfere\nwith the spatial resolution of the selected measurement\ntechnique and the specified measurement site selection.\nIf either of these interferences occur, the user may adapt\nthe  principles  of  the  method  to  the  needed  application,\nbut the interpretation of the results may change.\n3. 2  The  principles  of  this  practice  may  be  adapted  to\nother  semiconductor  wafers,  such  as  gallium  arsenide,\nbut  particular  concerns  with  those  other  materials  may\nnot be addressed adequately in this practice.\n3. 3  Uniformity  measurements  from  certain  types  of\nmeasurements  may  be  misinterpreted  if  the  user  is  not\naware of the full nature of the basic measurement being\nmade.  For example, sheet resistance is a function both\nof  the  inherent  resistivity  of  the  film  being  measured\nand  of  its  thickness  value.    Non-uniformity  in  sheet\nresistance values across the wafer may result from non-\nuniformity in resistivity (layer composition or structure)\nor  layer  thickness  (deposition  rate)  alone,  or  it  may\nresult from simultaneous variations of both parameters.\n3. 4  Changes in test equipment performance, or changes\nin   test   procedure   or   conditions   over   time   may\ndetrimentally  affect  the  ability  to  compare  test  results\nfrom this practice over time for a given film property or\nfabrication  step.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  user  to\nensure   that   the   measurement   system   and   process\nremains   in   sufficient   control   to   allow   time-wise\ncomparison  of  uniformity  results,  if  such  comparisons\nare needed.\n3. 5  Sampling  area  or  sampling  spot-size  may  cause\nmisinterpretation   of   the   cause   of   thin   film   non-\nuniformity  if  the  magnitude  of  the  non-uniformity  and\nits spatial scale, or rate of variation is not well matched\nto the sampling spot size and the selected distribution of\nmeasurement  sites.    While  this  should  not  be  a  serious\nconcern for most modern film deposition processes, and\nprocess equipments, which are operating in control, the\nprinciples of this limitation are worth elaborating.\n3. 5.1  If  the  sampling  area  or  the  spot  size  of  the  test\ninstrument is large compared to rates of film parameter\nchange (gradients) that are important to identify, it must\nbe recognized that such large sampling area instruments\ngenerate  some  form  of  spatial  average  response  that"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1618-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2004 3\nmay understate macroscopic film non-uniformity or fail\nto  respond  to  microscopic  film  non-uniformities  or\nboth.\n3. 5.2  If  the  sampling  area  or  spot  size  is  small,  it  is\ngenerally   possible   to   quantify   the   full   scale   of\nmacroscopic  film  non-uniformities.    However,  should\nspatial  fine-scale  systematic  film  variations  be  present,\nthey  may  affect  the  individual  measurements  in  an\ninconsistent  manner  unless  the  measurement  sampling\nplan  is  tailored  to  the  spatial  size  scale  of  the  fine\nvariations.    Such  tailoring  of  the  sampling  plan  is\ngenerally  incompatible  with  the  requirements  of  this\npractice.\n3. 6  For    the    most    meaningful    interpretation    of\nuniformity  data,  all  sampling  sites  should  represent\nequal  wafer  areas,  and  the  available  area  of  the  wafer\nshould  be  fully  sampled.    The  existence  of  wafer  flats\ncauses   a   failure   of   the   first   requirement   with   all\nconcentric  circle  sampling  plans.    The  need  of  the\nsemiconductor  industry  to  establish  as  large  a  quality\narea  as  possible  on  wafers  also  causes  a  failure  of  the\nfirst  requirement  for  the  outermost  circle  of  concentric\ncircle  sampling  plans  because  of  the  need  to  measure\nright  up  to  a  very  small  edge  exclusion  value.    The\nsecond  requirement  is  not  met  near  the  perimeter  of\nCartesian sampling plans.\n3. 7  Ideally,   measurements   would   be   made   at   the\nspecified sites in a random sequence so that instrument\ndrift or changes in other environmental parameters that\nmay  affect  measurement  results  would  have  a  random\ncorrelation  with  measurement  positions.  It  is  normally\nnot  practical  to  acquire  data  in  this  fashion.  Therefore,\nany  instrumental  or  environmental  change  that  may\noccur  will  have  a  correlation  with  the  spatial  ordering\nof  the  measurement  sequence.  While  such  changes  are\nexpected   to   have   about   the   same   effect   on   both\nconcentric    circle    and    Cartesian    sampling    plan\nmeasurements, providing the number of data points are\nabout the same, they would nevertheless have different\neffects  on  two-dimensional  contour  maps  that  resulted\nfrom these two different types of sampling plans.\n3. 8  Individual  test  instruments  and  test  methods  that\nmay be used to measure properties or characteristics of\nthin  films  are  subject  to  various  interferences  that  may\naffect  measurement  precision  consistency,  resolution,\nand   accuracy.      These   may   include   such   things   as\nsensitivity to stray illumination, rf-fields, and variations\nin temperature.  It is the responsibility of the user of this\npractice  to  consult  instrument  manuals  and  appropriate\ntest  methods  in  order  to  identify  and  control  potential\ninterferences with that instrument or method.\n3. 8.1  It is also the responsibility of the user to devise a\ntest for the inherent precision of the measurement being\nmade  so  that  imprecision  in  the  measurement  is  not\nmisinterpreted as non-uniformity of the thin film being\nevaluated   by   this   practice.      This   is   particularly\nimportant  for  application  of  this  practice  to  evaluating\nfilms from process steps that are capable of a very high\ndegree  of  uniformity,  for  example,  1%  across  a  wafer.\nSuch  tests  may  involve  using  known  uniform  or  non-\nuniform  test  specimens  whose  spatial  pattern  of  non-\nuniformity   has   been   found   to   be   very   stable   over\nextended periods of time.\n4  Referenced Standards\n4. 1  SEMI Standards\nSEMI      M1      \u2014      Specifications      for      Polished\nMonocrystalline Silicon Wafers\nSEMI   M20   \u2014   Practice   for   Establishing   a   Wafer\nCoordinate System\nSEMI  MF81  \u2014  Test  Method  for  Measuring  Radial\nResistivity Variation on Silicon Wafers\nSEMI  MF374  \u2014  Test  Method  for  Sheet  Resistance  of\nSilicon   Epitaxial,   Diffused,   Polysilicon,   and   Ion-\nImplanted  Layers  Using  an  In-Line  Four-Point  Probe\nwith the Single-Configuration Procedure\nSEMI  MF576  \u2014  Test  Method  for  Measurement  of\nInsulator  Thickness  and  Refractive  Index  on  Silicon\nSubstrates by Ellipsometry\nSEMI    MF673    \u2014    Test    Methods    for    Measuring\nResistivity of Semiconductor Slices or Sheet Resistance\nof  Semiconductor  Films  with  a  Non-contact  Eddy-\nCurrent Gage\nSEMI MF1241 \u2014 Terminology of Silicon Technology\nSEMI  MF1392  \u2014  Test  Method  for  Determining  Net\nCarrier    Density    Profiles    in    Silicon    Wafers    by\nCapacitance-Voltage   Measurements   with   a   Mercury\nProbe\nSEMI  MF1393  \u2014  Test  Method  for  Determining  Net\nCarrier  Density  in  Silicon  Wafers  by  Miller  Feedback\nProfiler Measurements with a Mercury Probe\nSEMI  MF1529  \u2014  Test  Method  for  Sheet  Resistance\nUniformity Evaluation by In-line Four-point Probe with\nthe Dual-configuration Procedure\nNOTICE:\nUnless  otherwise  indicated,  all  documents\ncited shall be the latest published versions.\n5  Terminology\n5. 1  Definitions  of  terms  used  in  this  practice  may  be\nfound in SEMI M1 and SEMI MF1241."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1618-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2004 4\n6  Summary of Practice\n6. 1  Measurements are made at the sites specified in the\nchosen     sampling     plan     using     the     appropriate\ninstrumentation  and  measurement  procedure  for  the\nfilm  parameter  of  interest.

The  intensity  of  the  white  light\nnecessary  must  be  determined  for  each  system.

The  absorption\nbands   are   very   sharp,   especially   for   the   Group   V\nelements,  and  therefore  peak  height  measurements  are\ndifficult  to  reproduce  from  instrument  to  instrument.\nUse of peak areas greatly reduces this variability.\n12. 1.1    Establish    baselines    for    each    peak    before\nmeasurement  of  the  area.    Use  only  the  area  above  the\nestablished   baseline   in   the   calculations.      Several\nalgorithms  are  available  on  various  commercial  FT-IR\ninstruments  to  obtain  the  desired  baseline  corrected\nareas.  The following is one suggested method:\n12. 1.1.1      Retrieve   the   sample   absorbance   spectrum\nfrom the computer storage disk.  With the wavenumber\nexpand  commands  available,  zoom  in  on  the  region  of\nthe  absorption  band(s)  of  interest.    Expand  until  this\nregion  is  only  slightly  larger  than  the  baseline  limit\nregions given in Table 1.\n12. 1.1.2      Employ   the   interactive   baseline   correction\nroutine  to  bring  the  spectral  baseline  to  coincide  with\nthe 0.0 absorbance line.  Refer to Table 1 for the upper\nand   lower   wavenumber   regions   for   guidance   in\nadjusting the baseline.  Expand in the absorbance scale\nas  necessary  to  improve  the  observation  of  the  noise\nand fine features of the spectrum in order to provide the\nbest  placement  of  the  baseline.    Apply  only  linear\ncorrections  with  the  fit  of  the  straight  line  through  the\npoints  on  both  sides  of  the  absorption  peak(s).    Note\nthat the peaks for boron and phosphorus are very close\ntogether   and   thus   only   one   baseline   is   obtained\nsurrounding  both  peaks.  Figures  2  and  3  show  spectra\nbefore  and  after,  respectively,  baseline  correction  for\nboron and phosphorus spectral region.\n12. 1.2   Measure   the   area   for   the   absorption   peak\nbetween  the  upper  and  lower  wavenumbers  given  in\nTable  1  for  the  integration  limits.    Most  computer\nalgorithms  handle  this  nicely.  However,  disable  the\nautomatic  zeroing  of  the  baseline  at  the  integration\nlimits.      If   not   disabled,   the   integration   would   not\nrepresent  the  baseline  as  established  in  Section  12.1.1\nand may result in errors.\n12. 1.3   Repeat   Sections   12.1.1   and   12.1.2   for   each\ncomponent desired for each specimen measured."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1630-0704 \xa9 SEMI 2004 5\nTable 1  Peak Location, Baseline and Integration Limits, and Calibration Factors\nBaseline Limits Integration Limits\nElement\nPeak cm\n\u22121"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Upper              Lower                            Upper              Lower\nFactor\nA"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"f(mm-cm)\nAluminum  (Al)    473.2    479    467    475.2    471.2    32.7\nAntimony  (Sb)    293.6    296    289    295.1    292.1    10.6\nArsenic  (As)    382.0    385    379    383.5    380.5      8.96\nBoron  (B)    319.6    323    313    321.5    318.0      9.02\nGallium  (Ga)    548.0    552    544    549.5    546.5    42.4\nIndium (In) 1175.9 1181 1169  1177.4 1174.4 244.0\nPhosphorus  (P)    316.0    323    313    317.5    314.5      4.93\nA\nThe factors given here do not all have the same degree of certainty.

It  was  developed  as  non-mandatory\ninformation  in  ASTM  during  the  initial  development  of  the  document  in  1994-5.

The  dopant  density,  or  the  concentration  of\nimpurities  for  this  test    method,  is  directly  obtained\nfrom the conversion Tables found in SEMI MF723.\nR1-2  Baber\u2019s\n5\ncalibration  factors  published  in  1980,\nwere   the   starting   point   for   the   current   factors.\nCorrections  or  modifications,  or  both,  to  his  published\ndata follow in this discussion.\nR1-2.1    Baber\u2019s  LTFT-IR  study  utilized  the  conversion\nrelations  reported  by  Irvin\n7\nin  1962,  relating  resistivity\nand impurity concentrations.  Currently, the conversion\ntables  given  in  SEMI  MF723  are  believed  to  be  more\nreliable.    Corrections  to  Baber\u2019s  factors  were  made  to\nreflect these new conversion tables.\nR1-2.2    The  factors  of  Baber  relate  peak  heights  of  the\nabsorption  bands  to  concentrations.  Peak  heights  are\nextremely  sensitive  to  several  FT-IR  parameters.    The\nphosphorus  band  at  316.0  cm\n\u22121\nand the arsenic band at\n382. 0  cm\n\u22121\nare  very  narrow,  about  0.25  cm\n\u22121\n,  and  thus\nthe  peak  heights  of  these  bands  vary  greatly  with\nnominal resolution, type of apodization, degree of zero-\nfilling, and mechanical strain on the sample.  The boron\nabsorption  at  319.6  cm\n\u22121\nband  used  in  this  test  method\nis   actually   a   composite   of   four   separate   boron\nabsorption  bands.    The  variability  of  the  measurement\nof  the  absorption  bands  is  reduced  considerably  when\npeak areas are used instead of peak heights.  The use of\npeak  areas  is  common  in  the  field  and  their  use  is\nspecified in this test method.\nR1-2.3    Further  minor  modifications  have  been  made\nover the in the period from about 1985 to about 1995 in\nseveral laboratories that use LTFT-IR spectrometers for\ndetermination of electrically active impurities.\nR1-2.3.1    Studies  with  and  without  the  white  light  on\nthe    silicon    samples,    covering    a    wide    range    of\nconcentrations,   are   valuable   as   tools   to   check   for\nconsistency of the boron and phosphorus factors, which\nare  indeed  the  most  common  impurities.

After\nabout 15 g of polysilicon has been melted and cooled in\nthe zone process, a polysilicon rod about 8 to 12 mm in\ndiameter and up to 70 mm in length is obtained.\n6. 1.2  In the second step, a single crystal silicon seed is\nmelted into the tail end of the polycrystalline rod and a\nsingle zone pass is done in the upward direction to level\nthe  impurities  and  to  convert  the  silicon  to  a  single\ncrystal rod.  This produces a single crystal silicon ingot\nabout  8  to  12  mm  in  diameter  and  up  to  70  mm  in\nlength  from  which  a  section  is  sliced  for  measurement\nof  impurities.

Hydrofluoric   acid   (HF)   solutions   are\nespecially    hazardous    to    the    eyes,    skin,    mucous\nmembranes, and the lungs.  Anyone using HF and other\nacids  must  be  familiar  with  the  potential  hazards  and\nmust    employ    proper    techniques    and    preventive\nmeasures to avoid injury.\n9. 2 The   rf   generator   and   coil   of   the   melter-zoner\napparatus can be injurious to the operator if the operator\nis   not   properly   trained   in   working   with   electrical\nconnections, rf fields, and hot parts.\n9. 3 Use  eye  protection  to  protect  the  operator  from  the\nbright  light  of  the  molten  silicon  in  the  melter-zoner\napparatus.\n10  Sampling\n10. 1 Granular  polysilicon  samples  are  best  handled  in\nclean,  dry  quartz  bottles.    Samples  are  always  taken\nwith clean silicon or quartz scoops or devices.\n10. 2 Granular polysilicon is commercially produced by\na   continuous   process   in   a   fluidized   bed   reactor.\nSamples  for  evaluation  by  this  practice  can  be  taken  in\nprocess,  while  packaging  (normally  in  270\u2013300  kg\nspecially  lined  drums),  or  at  the  point  of  use.    The\nsampling  point  is  therefore  determined  by  the  purpose\nof the evaluation.\n11  Reference Specimen\n11. 1 Use   a   large   homogeneous   sample   of   granular\npolysilicon reference material to monitor the process of\nconsolidation and conversion to a single crystal silicon.\nPeriodically   and   repeatedly   convert   this   reference\nmaterial   to   single   crystal   silicon   to   establish   the\nconsistency and cleanliness of this practice.\n11. 2 Collect    and    statistically    evaluate    the    values\nobtained by low-temperature Fourier transform infrared\nspectroscopy  for  carbon  and  the  acceptor  and  donor\nimpurities  in  the  analytical  slices  to  establish  and  keep\nthe process in control.\n12  Preparation of Apparatus\n12. 1 Take  the  utmost  care  to  ensure  the  cleanliness  of\nall parts of the melter/zoner, especially the quartz tube,\nsample  containers,  transfer  funnel,  and  the  carriage\nendpieces.\n12. 1.1  Clean the inner part of the quartz tube and etch\nit with 3:1 HF:HNO\n3\n.  Following the acid etch, rinse the\ntube  with  copious  amounts  of  DI  water  and  allow  it  to\ndry in a laminar air flow hood.\n12. 1.1.1  Warning:   Acids,   especially   HF,   are   very\nhazardous  to  the  eyes,  skin,  mucous  membranes,  and\nlungs.  Anyone using these acids must be familiar with\nand use precautionary means to avoid injury.\n12. 1.2  Etch, clean and dry other quartz parts, including\nsample  containers  and  funnels  as  in  Section  12.1.1\nexcept that the etchant used is 1:1 HF:H\n2\nO.\n12. 1.3  Carefully clean the carriage endpieces, stainless\nsteel  rods,  and  chucks  of  the  melter/zoner  by  rinsing\nwith  methanol  and  allowing  them  to  thoroughly  dry  in\nthe clean room environment.\n12. 2 Prepare  the  silicon  pedestals  and  single  crystal\nseed  rods  for  use  by  etching  with  a  continuous  stream\nof  the  MAE  for  15  to  20  s,  followed  quickly  with  a\ncopious rinse of DI water.  Air dry or blot dry with lint-\nfree paper.\n13  Procedure\n13. 1 Assemble  a  freshly  etched  and  dried  quartz  tube\ninto the carriage endpieces.\nNOTE 2:  Freshly,   as   referred   to   here   and   the   following\nparagraphs, refers to a time of less than 1 h.\n13. 2 Mount  a  freshly  etched  and  dried  silicon  pedestal\n(6 by 6 by 100 mm) in the upper chuck and place in the\nupper  endpiece.    Center  the  silicon  pedestal  within  the\nquartz  tube.    Adjust  the  carriage  so  that  the  bottom  of\nthe silicon pedestal is inside but not below the working\nrf  coil.    Remove  the  pedestal  and  chuck  and  set  aside\nfor later use.\n13. 3 Mount  a  freshly  cleaned  PTFE  plunger-diffuser\npart  on  the  lower  rod  assembly  and  place  it  inside  the\nbottom  of  the  quartz  tube.    Secure  the  rod  assembly  to\nthe  lower  endpiece  and  carefully  move  the  rod  and\nplunger to a point of about 100 to 120 mm below the rf\ncoil.    Start  the  argon  purge  and  diffuser  gas  flow  at  a\nrate of about 0.1 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM)\nthrough  the  lower  portal,  PTFE  diffuser,  and  exhaust\nout  the  top  of  the  open  quartz  tube  through  the  upper\nendpiece.\n13. 4 Introduce  the  granular  polysilicon  sample  through\nthe  upper  end  piece  with  a  quartz  funnel.

Reposition the carriage so that the\npedestal is midway between the rf coil.\n13. 6 Ignite   the   hydrogen-air   torch   and   position   it\nslightly  above  and  about  30  mm  from  the  working  coil\nimpacting  the  outside  of  the  quartz  tube.    Turn  on  and\nincrease  the  rf  power  to  about  80%  of  the  operating\npower  needed  for  melting.    Watch  for  rf  coupling  with\nthe  silicon  rod,  which  will  occur  in  about  2  min  as  is\nevident from the red glow of the pedestal.  Turn off the\ntorch  and  move  the  carriage  upward  at  a  rate  that  the\nred  hot  zone  follows  the  rf  coil  until  the  hot  zone  is  at\nthe bottom of the silicon pedestal.\n13. 7 Increase  the  rf  power  until  the  bottom  of  the\npedestal  melts.    Move  the  position  of  the  granules\nupward  with  the  lower  rod  and  PTFE  plunger  until  the\ntop  of  the  fluidized  bed  begins  to  melt  into  the  upper\npedestal.  As the granules melt into the upper pedestal,\nmove the entire carriage upward.\nNOTE 3:  The  melt  freezes  as  it  leaves  the  working  zone  of\nthe rf coil.  The consolidated rod diameter is smaller than the\ninside  diameter  of  the  quartz  tube  so  it  does  not  contact  the\ntube walls.\n13. 8 Continue    consolidation    growth    with    minor\nadjustments   until   a   consolidated   polysilicon   rod   of\nabout  9  mm  in  diameter  and  60  mm  in  length  is\nobtained.    Lower  the  polysilicon  granules  bed  and\nreduce the rf power permitting the tail end of the rod to\nsolidify.  Note the time required for the melting process\n(normally about 12 min).\n13. 9 Remove the lower rod and plunger from the quartz\ntube by removal of part of the lower endpiece.  Let the\nexcess  polysilicon  granules  fall  out  the  bottom  of  the\ntube and discard them.\n13. 10 Remove   the   PTFE   plunger/diffuser   from   the\nlower  stainless  steel  rod  and  replace  it  with  the  lower\nseed chuck (see Figure 1).\n13. 11 Mount  a  freshly  etched  and  dried  single  crystal\nsilicon seed (2.5 by 2.5 by 100 mm) in the lower chuck.\nPlace the silicon seed rod, chuck, and lower rod into the\nquartz  tube  through  the  bottom  as  before.    Move  the\nlower  rod  upward  until  the  seed  crystal  is  about  5  mm\nbelow   the   tip   of   the   consolidated   polysilicon   rod\npreviously   produced.      Purge   the   entire   tube   for   a\nminimum of 1 min at a flow rate of 0.5 SCFM.\n13. 12 Reduce  the  argon  purge  to  about  0.1  SCFM.\nReignite  the  hydrogen  torch  and  increase  the  rf  power\nto  80%  needed  to  melt  silicon.    Watch  for  the  glow  of\nthe  consolidated  polysilicon  rod  as  rf  coupling  begins.\nShut off the torch.\n13. 13 Increase    rf    power    until    the    consolidated\npolysilicon  rod  tip  is  molten  and  then  raise  the  seed  to\npenetrate  into  the  melt.    Hold  in  this  position  until  the\nseed has taken sufficient heat to melt and becomes one\nwith the melt from the consolidated polysilicon rod.\n13. 14 In a trial and error mode, increase the rf power as\nneeded  to  carry  out  the  one  pass  zone  leveling.    When\nthe   proper   rf   power   is   established,   activate   the\nmotorized  carriage  for  movement  downward  (floating\nzone  movement  is  upward)  at  a  rate  to  match  that\nemployed  during  the  consolidation  process,  typically  a\nzone  rate  of  about  5.0  mm  per  minute.    Continue  the\nzoning  until  the  entire  consolidated  polysilicon  rod  has\nbeen  converted  to  a  single  crystal  as  is  evident  by  the\nfour  growth  facet  lines.    Now,  slightly  reduce  the  rf\npower   and   slowly   move   the   lower   rod   downward\nseparating  the  single  crystal  ingot  from  the  polysilicon\nrod.  Turn off the rf power.  Allow about 2 min for the\ningot to cool.\n13. 15 Remove the single crystal ingot and break off the\nseed  crystal  after  scoring  with  a  diamond  scribe.    Save\nthe  remaining  seed  for  growth  of  the  next  crystal.\nExamine  the  crystal  to  be  sure  the  growth  facet  lines\nextend the entire length of the ingot.\n13. 16 Mount  the  crystal  in  the  saw  chuck  and  cut  an\nanalytical  slice  2  to  4  mm  thick  as  needed  from  the\ncenter one-third of the crystal.\nNOTE 4:  Since  segregation  of  the  impurities  occurs  both\nduring  the  consolidation  step  and  the  conversion  to  single\ncrystal,  the  one  pass  zone  during  the  conversion  to  single\ncrystal  at  the  same  rate  as  the  consolidation  step  effectively\nlevels   these   impurities.      Thus,   the   concentration   of   the\nimpurities  in  the  ingot  is  essentially  constant  except  at  both\nextremes.\n13. 17 Prepare   the   analytical   slice   for   infrared   or\nphotoluminescence  spectroscopic  measurements  with\napplication  of  a  bright  chemical  etch  or  a  mechanical\npolish.\n13. 17.1  To   etch,   hold   the   slice   with   polyethylene\nforceps  and  suspend  it  into  a  PTFE  beaker  filled  with\nthe  mixed  acid  etchant  as  described  in  Section  8.5.\nGently  stir  the  solution  with  a  magnetic  stir  bar  while\nimmersing  the  silicon  slice  for  4  min.

Cores must\nbe reetched if the maximum holding period is exceeded.\nTo  extend  the  holding  period,  cores  may  be  wrapped\nand  sealed  in  a  suitably  clean  material  and  stored  in  a\nclean environment until use.\nNOTE 1:  ISO Class 5 as defined in ISO 14644-1 is about the\nsame as Class 100 as defined in Federal Standard 209E.\n6. 3  A control rod is etched and float-zoned along with\nthe  sample  rods  to  monitor  any  contamination  inter-\nferences  from  the  sample  preparation  and  float  zoning\nprocess.\n6. 4  The   polysilicon   cores   are   converted   to   single\ncrystal  ingots  by  the  float-zone  technique,  using  one\nzone pass in an argon atmosphere.

For\nrods  less  than  60-mm  diameter,  it  is  not  possible  to\nproduce  single  crystal  ingots  of  sufficient  zone  length\nfor accurate analysis.
