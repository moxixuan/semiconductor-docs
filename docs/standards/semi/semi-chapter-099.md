SEMI M10-1296 © SEMI 1987, 19961 SEMI M10-1296STANDARD NOMENCLATURE FOR IDENTIFICATION OFSTRUCTURES AND FEATURES SEEN ON GALLIUM ARSENIDEWAFERS 1 Scope1.1 The purpose of this document is to list, illustrate,and define various characters, features, andcontaminants that are seen on highly polished GaAswafers and present recommended practices forobservation of these defects. These occurrences arefrequently referred to as surface defects. The defectsand common synonyms are arranged alphabetically inSection 4, and each structure is referred to by its mostcommon name and, in some cases, probably origins.1.2 Two cases of surface preparati ons are consideredin this document: (1) surfaces after chemical polishing,and (2) mechanically and chemically polished surfaces.1.3 This standard may involve haz ardous materials,operations, and equipment. This standard does notpurport to address all the safety problems associatedwith its use. It is the responsibility of whoever uses thisstandard to consult and establish appropriate safety andhealth practices and determine the applicability ofregulatory limitations prior to use. 2 Applicable Documents2.1 SEMI StandardSEMI M9  Specifications for Round PolishedMonocrystalline Gallium Arsenide Slices 2.2 ASTM Standard1F 47  Crystallographic Perfection of Silicon byPreferential Etch Techniques 2.3 Other Standard2ANSI/ASQC Z1.4-1993  Sampling Procedures andTables for Inspection by Attributes 3 Significance and Use3.1 This document contains a com pilation of the mostcommonly observed singularly discernable structureson polished GaAs surfaces.

The origins of some chips are inthe handling of wafers arising from the physicaltransfer or placement of the specimen for process,measurement, or inspection purposes. The size of achip is defined by its maximum radial depth andperipheral chord length as measurable on anorthographic shadow projection of the specimenoutline.apex chip Any material missing from the edge of awafer having at least 2 distinct interior boundarieswhich form one or more distinct intersections.chuck marks  Any physical mark on either surface ofa wafer caused by a chuck or wand.contaminant  (solvent residue, wax residue, film,mottled surface, smudge): Surface feature that cannotbe removed by the pre-inspection (non-etching)cleaning.NOTE Contaminant may be foreign matter on the surfacesuch as localized areas which are smudged, stained,discolored, mottled, etc., or larger areas exhibiting a hazy orcloudy appearance resulting from a film of foreign material.Solvent residue: type of film found on wafersurfaces after solvent evaporation from the surface.Note: The residue comes from either the solventitself or material that the solvent has removed fromthe surface and redeposited. Wax residue: film ofwax that migrated onto the wafer surface fromseveral possible sources.NOTE The wax originally may have been used to hold thecrystal in place during slicing or polishing. Excessive heatused in mounting or demounting, during lapping or polishingprocesses, may cause the wax to polymerize.crack  Cleavage or fracture that extends to the surfaceof a slice. It may or may not pass through the entire

Often cracks are caused by theimproper handling of wafers.NOTE Some crack-defect structures can be traced to processrelated events.cavity  (void) A vacancy or hole in the wafer.NOTE Usually left by dissolved precipitates and Gainclusions, As disassociation or created by excess vaporpressure.Dimple  Deformation appearing in mechanicallypolished GaAs wafers.NOTE This surface texture can be induced by floating thewafers during the initial stages of polishing.Dislocation  See slip, lineage, pit.edge chip  See chip.Embedded  abrasive grains Abrasive particlesmechanically forced into the surface of the wafer.etch pi t  See pit.film  See contaminant.flake  Material missing from one, but not the other,side of a wafer, whose sole interior boundary is onedistinct line or arc not exceeding 2 mm in length, norprojecting into the wafer beyond the specified edgeexclusion.gallium inclusion  A segregated Ga-rich dropletincorporated into the surface structure.NOTE Normally caused by insufficient As vapor pressure atthe termination of the crystal growth process or by Gacomplexing with some dopants near saturation.grain boundary  See lineage.haze  (cloud, nebula): Attributable to light scatteringby concentrations of microscopic surface irregularitiessuch as pits, oxides, small ridges or scratches, particles,etc. The light reflection from an individual irregularityprobably could not be readily detected by the unaidedeye, so haze is a mass effect. It is seen as a high densityof tiny reflections.NOTE This type of contamination may occur during slicing,lapping, or polishing.lamella  A special case of the twin. A multiple twin,extremely thin and relatively long, which may intersectmore than one plane.lineage  (dislocation pits, grain boundary): Low-angle grain boundary resulting from an array ofdislocations. This angle may vary from a fraction of asecond to a minute of arc difference in orientation fromone part of the crystal to another. The array of dislocations will appear as rows of pits on apreferentially etched surface.NOTE Lineage can be induced into the material in crystalgrowth or in subsequent thermal or epitaxial processes.Lineage will be visible to the unaided eye only afterpreferential etching.macroscratch See scratch.microscratch  See scratch.microtwin  See twin.orange peel  (roughness, texture): Large featuredroughened type of surface visible to the unaided eye,occasionally seen on all types of polished wafers.NOTE Orange peel is usually symptomatic of a processcontrol problem. In the case of chemical polishing forinstance, an excessively fast polishing rate, or nonuniformflow of oxidizer during polishing, can result in orange peel.Conversely, it can also be caused by insufficient stockremoval.particulate  (dust): Discrete particle of materialwhich can usually be removed by (non-etching)cleaning.pit  (dislocation, etch pit): Depression in the wafersurface which has a definite and distinguishable shape,that is, a place where the sloped sides of the pit meetthe wafer surface.NOTE Pits can be caused by the various growths or polishingprocesses.Preferential etch pits result where dislocations intersectthe wafer surface after treatment with a preferentialetch. These pits so formed usually have a characteristicshape related to the surface and bulk crystallographicorientation.polycrystalline  (poly): Body of semiconductormaterials that contain large-angle grain boundaries,twin boundaries, or both.precipitates  A localized concentration of dopant atits solubility limit formed during crystal growth.probe damage  Any damage to the wafer surfacecaused by mechanical probing or measurement.roughness  see orange peel.saw blade defects A depression in the wafer surfacemade by the blade, which may not be visible beforepolishing.saw exit chip A particular kind of edge chip, found atthe point where the saw blade completed its cut of thewafer. It is typically flat or arc shaped instead ofirregular in shape, and can sometimes be confused withthe orientation flats.

NOTE 1: Scattering event size reported by SSIS will differfrom the physical size of the object. The figure captions inthe examples highlight this fact. No useful method exists atthe present time to quantify this relationship (see Section7.3.3.3)4.3.1.1 Discussion  Related characteristics includethe following: Device characteristics that may be affected critical feature dimensions, lithographic equipmentfocus, gate oxide integrity. Detection characteristics used for characterization mound height, diameter at 50% height. Discrimination characteristics used forcharacterization  positive height: 10100 nm, orapproximately 20% of the epi layer thickness;diameter: 0.16 m; circular symmetry.  Specification characteristics used for waferqualification  number per wafer, mound height,height to diameter.4.3.2 epi stacking fault  a two dimensional effect thatresults from a deviation from the normal stackingsequence of atoms in a crystal. \[SEMI MF154, SEMIMF1727\]NOTE 2: Discrimination and specification characteristics aregiven in this section to facilitate equipment development (seeSection 7.3.3.3) and are not intended for use in commercialwafer specifications.4.3.2.1 Discussion  Epi stacking faults are typicallylinked together into squares in the case of &#123;100&#125;oriented wafers, and triangles in the case of &#123;111&#125;oriented wafers. Most stacking faults are nucleated atthe epi layer substrate boundary, though some havebeen observed being nucleated further into the epigrowth process. Faults are aligned along specificcrystallographic directions. For &#123;100&#125; wafer the sidesof the faults are aligned along &lt;110&gt; directions. Thelength of a side is typically proportional to the epi layerthickness and related to the crystallographic orientation.In order to minimize the strain around a stacking faultcontaminants may diffuse to these defects. Somestacking faults may have an effect on the local growthrate giving the stacking fault a three dimension aspect.This three dimensional aspect changes their lightscattering cross section when observed by an SSIS (seeFigures 3 through 7). Still more complicated areoverlapping stacking faults which scatter even morethan a single stacking fault of the same size (see figure4). Other types of defects may be composites ofstacking faults and polysilicon growth which can alsoappear larger than a single stacking fault of the samelateral dimensions (see Figures 5 and 6). Relatedcharacteristics include the following:
