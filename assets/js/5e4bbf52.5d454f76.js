Inorganic  carbon  as  dissolved\ncarbon  dioxide  (CO\n2\n),  bicarbonate,  and  carbonate  can\nbe present at high ppm levels according to the geology\nof the water supply.  Organic carbon reflects biological\ninput   and   man-made   contaminants   such   as   oils,\npesticides,  and  fertilizers.    Ground  and  well  waters\nnormally  have  significantly  lower  organic  content  than\nsurface  waters.    To  remove  the  majority  of  organics,\nmost  UPW  systems  employ  reverse  osmosis;  anion\nexchange resin and ultraviolet (UV) destruction are also\nemployed to remove organics.  Some volatile organics,\nsuch  as  trihalomethanes  (THM),  may  be  controlled  by\nthe  use  of  vacuum  degasification.    The  control  of\norganics is essential for preventing organic fouling and\nmaintaining  resin  beds  at  high  efficiency.

Changes  in  the\nincoming   feed   water   due   to   seasonal   or   extreme\nweather  conditions  can  also  cause  increases  in  TOC\nreadings.\n8. 2.2  Method of  TOC Measurement for Source Water\n8. 2.2.1  There are various methods for measuring TOC,\nand    several    TOC    analyzers    are    available.    TOC\nmeasurement   generally   involves   the   oxidation   of\norganic   materials   by   means   of   temperature,   UV\nradiation, and/or chemicals. The CO\n2\nproduced by these\nreactions   can   then   be   measured   by   non-dispersive\ninfrared  analysis  (NDIR)  or  conductivity  (resistivity)\ndifferential.   The   exact   method   utilized   will   vary\ndepending  on  the  TOC  instrumentation  employed  and\nthe   method   may   also   affect   the   TOC   readings   as\ndifferent  methods  have  different  recoveries  of  various\norganics. Some instruments will also require the use of\na  carrier  gas  such  as  air  or  nitrogen,  while  others\nmeasure TOC directly.\n8. 2.3  Monitoring TOC in the UPW System\n8. 2.3.1    TOC  is  a  useful  test  to  measure  the  organic\nremoval  effectiveness  of  the  UPW  system  components\nincluding    Carbon,    RO,    Degasification,    and    Ion\nExchange.    Suggested  measurement  points  are  city\nfeed, pre and post RO membrane, and final filter, with a\nminimum  frequency  that  reflects  possible  changes  in\norganics  from  the  feed  source  or  UPW  components.\nAfter  the  RO,  TOC  drops  from  low  ppm  levels  in  the\nsource  water  to  mid  ppb  range,  and  to  single  digit  ppb\nlevels   after   the   mixed   resin   beds   and   UV   TOC\nreduction units.\n8. 2.4  Monitoring TOC at the POU\n8. 2.4.1    TOC  may  be  measured  at  the  point-of-use  to\ndetermine quality changes from the distribution system\nand the manufacturing tool. Short wavelength UV (185\nnm)  is  capable  of  breaking  up  residual  organics  into\ncharged organic molecules. TOC which survives to the\npoint  of  use  in  a  UPW  system  are  typically  either\n\xeclight\xee    molecules    or    small    fragments    of    larger\nmolecules such as acetate and formate.  While low TOC\nmeans  that  the  UPW  system  is  working  effectively  to\neliminate  the  source  water  organic  load,  this  test  is  not\nan  accurate  measure  of  sterility  of  a  UPW  system.  In\naddition, TOC levels at POU can also reflect carryover\nfrom chemical baths and contaminants in cleanroom air.\n8. 3  Dissolved Oxygen (ppb)\n8. 3.1          Dissolved     oxygen     (DO)     content     can     be\ncontrolled,   if   desired.   Rinsing   hydrogen   passivated\nsilicon wafer surfaces with high DO UPW can result in\netching of the silicon by the oxygenated UPW and loss\nof control of gate oxide thickness.\n8. 4  Particulate Matter (Particles/L)\n8. 4.1  Sources of Particles in Ultrapure Water Supplies\n8. 4.1.1  Particles  that  adhere  to  wafer  surfaces  at  each\nstep  of  the  integrated  circuit  device  manufacture  may\nimpair      the      application      of      thin-films      and\nphotolithographic   substances,   and   ultimately   cause\ndiscrete  and  integrated  transistors  to  fail  because  of\nresultant  physical  imperfections.    Particles  originate  in\nthe  incoming  city  water  and  may  also  be  generated\nfrom  degradation  of  the  UPW  system  components  or\noperational activities. Incoming source water contains a\nhigh   level   of   particles   and   is   initially   filtered   by\nprefilters  and  mixed  media  in  order  to  remove  gross\nphysical turbidity in the micron range.\n8. 4.1.2        Following    reverse    osmosis,    source    water\nparticles   have   been   greatly   reduced,   as   the   RO\nmembranes  also  reject  particles.    It  is  essential  to\nminimize   the   particle   load   to   the   RO   to   prevent\nmembrane   fouling   and   premature   or   frequent   RO\ncleanings.  From  the  RO  outlet  forward  in  the  system,\nthe  particle  load  in  the  UPW  originates  from  system\ncomponents.  Particle  sources  can  be  RO  membrane\nmodules,  piping  components,  valves  and  other  similar\ncontrol  devices,  tank  linings,  resin  fines  and  other\nsources   where   materials   are   undergoing   wear   or\ndegradation and are shedding particles.\n8. 4.1.3  After the ion-exchange resin beds, increasingly\nsmaller dimension filters are used in the range 0.2 to 1.0\nmicrons to remove residual particles and resin fines.  In\nmost  ultrahigh  purity  applications,  ultra  filtration  at\n10,000  molecular  weight  is  utilized.    In  most  UPW\nsystems,  the  presence  of  significant  quantities  of  sub-\nmicron  particles  at  the  final  filter  may  indicate  the\nbreakdown  of  upstream  UPW  system  components.  In\naddition,  POU  filters  on  tools  can  be  a  source  of\ncontamination if not maintained.\n8. 4.2  Optical Particle Counters (OPC)\n8. 4.2.1    On-line  methods  using  laser  optical  particle\ncounting    technology    are    recommended    for    trend\nanalysis     and     specification     compliance.     These\ninstruments  can  monitor  particles  in  the  0.03  to  >  0.5\nmicron   range   depending   on   the   system   component\nbeing tested. Particle counting using an OPC requires a\ngood  sample  port  connection  to  eliminate  false  counts.\nGood counter maintenance, including annual calibration\nand   replacement   of   tubing   and   fittings   is   critical\nespecially  if  monitoring  particles  \u2264  0.05  microns.  In\norder  to  monitor  trend  analysis  with  good  statistical"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F75-1102 \xa9 SEMI 2002 4\nprocess  control  (SPC),  the  number  of  particles  per\nsample  interval  should  be  sufficient  for  good  statistics\n(e.g. > 20 particles per sample interval).   For example,\nto    obtain    a    coefficient    of    variation    (standard\ndeviation/mean) of 10%, it is necessary that at least 100\nparticles greater than the control be counted.\n8. 4.3  Scanning  Electron  Microscopy  (SEM)  Analysis\nor Direct Count Analysis of Particles and Bacteria\n8. 4.3.1    SEM  is  used  to  analyze  particles  and  bacteria\nwithin  the  UPW  system.    Three  major  aspects  of  the\nSEM    method    are    the    enumeration    of    particles,\nenumeration  of  bacteria  and  the  determination  of  the\nelemental    composition    of    the    captured    particles.\nDepending on the particulate level in the UPW, a large\nvolume of UPW is filtered on-line, typically at the final\nfilter.  Due  to  particles  created  by  the  act  of  sampling\nand  the  preexisting  particles  found  normally  on  a  new\nfilter prior to use, a volume of over 1000 liters may be\nrequired   to   get   a   statistically   valid   result.   In   the\nlaboratory,  the  filter  is  removed  from  the  filter  holder\nand   placed   in   the   vacuum   chamber   of   a   SEM\ninstrument.    A  focused  beam  of  electrons  is  scanned\nacross the filter, systematically allowing the size, shape\nand  distribution  of  the  particles  to  be  measured.    The\nelectron microscope is capable of extremely high power\ndetection  (10,000\u25ca  magnification),  and  the  counting\nprocess may be automated.  Bacteria and particles in the\n0. 05 to > 0.5 micron range are detected and counted.\n8. 4.3.2  When SEM particle capture filters are installed\nat  critical  areas  in  the  UPW  system  on  a  continuous\nbasis, they may be utilized to determine the source and\nnature of intermittent particle excursions.\n8. 4.4  Identification of Particles\n8. 4.4.1      As   part   of   the   SEM   analysis,   an   Energy\nDispersive  X-ray  Beam  (EDX)  may  be  applied  to  a\nparticle,   which   produces   a   spectral   output   of   the\ncomposition  of  the  particle.    EDX  results  allow  the\nbasic     classification     of     organic     and     inorganic\ncomponents.  Elemental  compositions  are  provided  that\ncan  be  used  to  trace  the  source  of  particulates.    For\nexample, a particle having Cr and Fe peaks is probably\nfrom a stainless steel source, while one having C and F\npeaks  is  most  probably  composed  of  fluoropolymer\nmaterials.\n8. 5  Bacteria\n8. 5.1  Sources of Bacteria in Water Supplies\n8. 5.1.1    Incoming  city  water  supplies  and  UPW  system\ncomponents   are   all   potential   sources   of   biological\ncontaminants  if  not  monitored  and  controlled.    Viable\n(live)  counts  are  usually  non-detectable  or  very  low  in\nthe city water due to chlorination. Chlorine removal and\nlow flow areas in the components are the main catalysts\nfor rapid biological growth in an UPW system. Fouling\nof  RO  membranes  and  ion-exchange  resins  may  occur,\nrequiring  costly  remediation.    Seasonal  variations  may\ngreatly change the bacterial count of source water.\n8. 5.1.2  The oligotrophic nature of the UPW causes the\nbacteria   to   become   hydrophobic   which   creates   a\nthermodynamic  adhesion  to  the  wall.    The  bacteria,\nonce  adhered  to  the  wall  have  a  higher  degree  of\nprobability  of  having  the  nutrients  required  for  growth\nbrought  by  them  than  the  planktonic  bacteria  in  the\nsystem.  This process initiates the creation of a biofilm.\nWhile    some    system    owners    employ    sanitization\nprograms  in  hopes  of  safeguarding  against  microbial\nactivity,   biofilm   can   be   prove   resistant   and   may\npermanently  coat  the  inaccessible  surfaces  of  valves\nand  dead-legs.  Despite  the  fact  that  UPW  systems  are\ndesigned  to  be  hostile  to  most  bacterial  species,  the\nformation  of  biofilm  on  filters,  in  membranes,  and  in\nion-exchange    resins    is    widespread    and    periodic\nflourishing  of  bacterial  colonies  can  be  a  costly  long-\nterm  problem.        Once  in  the  tool,  live  bacteria  can\nmultiply  further  particularly  in  low  flow  area  and  pose\nan ever greater threat.\n8. 5.2  Viable Bacteria by Culture\n8. 5.2.1  Replicate    samples    are    collected    at    each\nsampling  point  in  sterile  containers,  passed  through\nspecial  sterile  filters,  and  then  dosed  with  a  growth\nmedium.    In  an  incubator,  bacteria  are  cultured  and\ngrow  to  form  colonies.    The  bacteria  colonies  are\ncounted   under   low   power   magnification   after   a\nspecified   interval   and   at   a   specified   temperature.\nDifferent   methods   will   enumerate   different   results.\nResults   may   vary   depending   upon   factors   such   as\nsample  volume,  growth  media,  incubation  time  and\ntemperature,  and  enumeration  methods.    It  may  be\nnecessary  to  evaluate  different  methods  to  determine\nthe best recovery for a specific UPW system.  Bacteria\nresults  are  reported  as  colony-forming  units  (CFU)  per\nunit  volume  (e.g.  100  mL  or  1000  mL).    For  very  low\nbacteria  UPW  systems,  larger  sized  samples  may  be\ncollected  to  provide  lower  detection  limits.    Larger\nvolumes  can  be  filtered  using  this  method,  making  the\nbacterial counts more statistically significant.\n8. 5.3  Total Bacteria by Epifluorescence\n8. 5.3.1      After   collection,   samples   are   filtered   onto\npolycarbonate  membranes,  which  are  then  stained  with\ndyes  that  cause  biological  materials  to  fluoresce  under\nultraviolet light.  A high power microscope is employed\nto  visually  identify  bacteria,  both  live  and  dead,  and  a\ncounting method is used to give statistical accuracy for\nthe    sample    size.        This    test    provides    accurate\ninformation  about  actual  bacterial  content  (both  viable\nand  non-viable)  of  the  UPW  system,  rather  than  an"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F75-1102 \xa9 SEMI 2002 5\nestimate  of  bacteria  that  is  capable  of  being  cultured\nduring  a  growth  opportunity  (the  culture  method).  On\nline  samples  may  also  be  obtained  utilizing  a  method\nsimilar  to  that  of  the  SEM  particle  capture  method.\nLarger   volumes   can   be   filtered   using   this   method\nmaking    the    bacterial    counts    more    statistically\nsignificant. The culture method may also be performed\nconcurrently to determine if an increase in levels is due\nto live or dead bacteria.\n8. 5.4  Total Viable Organisms by Scan RDI\n8. 5.4.1      Scan   RDI   is   a   semi-automated   method   of\nmeasuring  total  viability  counts.  The  method  is  able  to\ndetect a single cell based on direct measurements of cell\nactivity  and  includes  bacteria  and  other  live  organisms\nthat may be present in biofilm.\n8. 5.4.2  The sample is filtered through a membrane and\na   counterstain   is   added   to   minimize   background\nfluorescence.  Viable  organisms  are  labeled  using  a\nnonfluorescent  substrate  that  diffuses  across  the  cell\nmembrane.  The  labeling  differentiates  between  viable\nand  dead  cells  based  on  the  presence  or  absence  of\nesterase activity and intact cell membranes. Only viable\ncell with membrane activity have the ability to perform\nthis  cleavage  and  retain  the  fluorescent  label.  No  cell\ngrowth is required. The membrane is then scanned by a\nsolid-phase   laser-scanning   cytometer.   The   cells   are\ndetected, counted and verified within minutes.\n8. 6  Silica\n8. 6.1  Forms of Silica in UPW Systems\n8. 6.1.1    Silica  exists  primarily  in  two  forms  as  silicates\nand  as  polymeric  silica.  Silicates  are  referred  to  as\ndissolved silica and are reactive to molybdate using the\nheteropoly  method.  The  polymeric  forms  are  called\ncolloidal   silica   or   particulate   silica   and   are   not\nmeasured  directly  by  on-line  analyzers.    As  pH  in  a\nUPW  system  is  lowered,  silicates  polymerize  to  form\ncolloidal   silica,   which   range   in   size   from   a   few\nnanometers to several tenths of a micron.\n8. 6.1.2    As  with  TOC,  RO  membranes  are  responsible\nfor  the  gross  rejection  of  silica  in  incoming  waters.\nWithin  the  UPW  system,  dissolved  silica  is  further\nremoved   in   the   anionic   ion   exchange   resin   beads.\nHowever,  dissolved  silica  is  only  weakly  attracted  to\nthe  anionic  resins,  and  is  one  of  the  first  species  to  be\nliberated  when  the  resin  beds  approach  exhaustion.\nAfter  anion  resins  are  exhausted,  increasingly  high\nlevels of silica are released into the UPW stream. Since\ndissolved  silica  is  only  weakly  negatively  charged,  the\non-line  resistivity  meter  is  not  sensitive  enough  to\ndetect silica leakage prior to total resin bed exhaustion,\ni.e. breakthrough.  It is very important to detect this on-\nset of silica breakthrough before a drop in resistivity. If"),(0,i.yg)("h2",{id:"this-does-occur-then-cl"},"this does occur, then Cl"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"and other monovalent ions may\npass from the resin to the point of use. This would also\nbe accompanied by a decrease in the resistivity from the\nresin  beds.  This  occurs  because  ions  that  are  stored  on\nthe resin beds over a period of time become liberated as\ntheir  exchange  sites  are  taken  over  by  other  higher-\naffinity ions (e.g. nitrate, sulfate).\n8. 6.2  Dissolved Silica Techniques\n8. 6.2.1      For   the   measurement   of   dissolved   silica,   a\ncolorimetry heteropoly blue method is used.  Dissolved\nsilica  reacts  with  the  molybdate  reagent  at  acidic  pH,\nand  forms  a  yellow  complex  in  direct  proportion  to\nconcentration.   A   reducing   agent   is   added   to   the\nprepared sample, causing a blue color to develop.  This\ncolor    change    can    be    quantified    by    a    sensitive\nspectrophotometer   for   ppb   to   sub-ppb   levels   of\ndissolved      silica.      On-line      instruments      provide\ncontinuous     monitoring     of     UPW     systems.     Ion\nChromatography    may    also    be    used    to    measure\ndissolved silica.\n8. 6.3  Total Silica Technique\n8. 6.3.1    Since  all  forms  of  silica  are  not  reactive  in  the\nheteropoly  method,  the  quantity  of  total  silica  in  UPW\nmust  be  verified  independently.    Techniques  such  as\nICP-MS  are  capable  of  quantifying  the  silicon  present\nto  sub  ppb  levels  after  pre-concentration.  The  method\ndetection limit of total silica obtained by this technique\nis in the range of 0.5 ppb.\n8. 6.4  Measurement Methods For Total Silica\n8. 6.4.1      Total   Silica   may   be   measured   by   Graphite\nFurnace  Atomic  Absorption  Spectroscopy  (GFAAS),\nInductively      Coupled      Plasma      Atomic-Emission\nSpectroscopy    (ICP-AES)    or    Inductively    Coupled\nPlasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) at ppb levels.\n8. 6.5  Colloidal Silica\n8. 6.5.1        The    difference    between    total    silica    and\ndissolved  silica  is  assumed  to  be  represented  by  the\ncolloidal  form  of  silica.  Colloidal  silica  is  partially\nremoved  by  the  RO  membrane,  however,  some  hot\nUPW feed streams may carry a higher concentration of\ncolloidal  silica.    Colloidal  silica  cannot  be  detected  by\non-line resistivity or dissolved silica testing, but may be\ndetected as a component of non-volatile residue.\n8. 7  Non-Volatile Residue (NVR)\n8. 7.1    Non-volatile  residue  in  UPW  primarily  consists\nof  dissolved  inorganic  material.    In  the  final  polished\nUPW  the  most  likely  dissolved  inorganic  material  is\nsilica  in  both  the  dissolved  and  colloidal  form.    The\nprimary  source  of  this  breakthrough  silica  is  the  anion\nresin  bed  as  it  approaches  exhaustion.

This  off-\nline sampling and testing requires special apparatus and\ntrained personnel. A clear understanding of the limits of\neach method is required before its application.\n9. 1.3    All  on-line  monitoring  requires  clean  and  tight\nsample  port  connections  in  order  to  eliminate  false\ncounts.\n9. 2    Testing  at  critical  sampling  points,  such  as  point-\nof-use,  requires  special  sampling  apparatus  and  trained\npersonnel.    The    enclosures    and    mini-environments\naround   wet   benches   that   are   designed   to   prevent\naccidental  access  and  to  isolate  human  contamination\nfrom the wafer can make it difficult to sample the bath.\nHowever, contamination-free sampling can be done in a\nsafe way using high purity fluoropolymer apparatus and\ntrained qualified personnel.\n9. 3      The   utilization   of   unbiased,   independent   and\nexperienced   personnel   in   obtaining   data   at   critical\nsampling  sites  with  the  UPW  system  where  on  -line\ninstrumentation    is    not    available    is    essential    in\ndetermining   the   overall   performance   of   the   UPW\nsystem.\n9. 4      See   Table   1,   \xecUPW   System   Test   Parameters,\nSampling    Points,    and    Recommended    Monitoring\nFrequency for Assuring Good UPW System Operation\xee\nfor     sample     point     and     monitoring     frequency\nrecommendations."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F75-1102 \xa9 SEMI 2002 8\nTable 1  UPW System Test Parameters, Sampling Points and Recommended Monitoring Frequency for\nAssuring Good UPW System Operation\nType of\nWater"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Source\nIncoming\nFeed pre\nRO filters\nPre RO\nPost RO\nprefilters\nUPW\nPost RO\nUPW\nPost Ion\nExchange\nUPW\nPost Final\nFilter\nUPW\nReturn Loop\nUPW\nPOU  Tools\n(Recommended)\nResistivity              -               Continuous\n(Conductivity)\nContinuous\n(Conductivity)\nContinuous\n(Conductivity)\nContinuous\n(Conductivity)\nContinuous"),(0,i.yg)("h2",{id:"conductivity"},"(Conductivity)"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"TOC          Bi-Weekly          Bi-Weekly          Continuous          Continuous         Continuous         Continuous          Bi-Weekly\nParticles\nOPC\nMonthly           Monthly             Monthly            Continuous         Continuous         Continuous           Monthly\nParticle\nSEM"),(0,i.yg)("ul",null,(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("pre",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("code",{parentName:"pre"},"                   -                          -                        Bi-monthly                        Monthly          Bi-monthly           Monthly\n")),(0,i.yg)("p",{parentName:"li"},"Bacteria         Biweekly          Biweekly            Biweekly         Biweekly         Weekly         Weekly            Bi-weekly\nDissolved\nSilica\nMonthly           Monthly             Monthly           Continuous          Continuous          Continuous           Monthly\nTotal\nSilica\nMonthly           Monthly             Monthly             Bi-weekly            Weekly             Weekly            Bi-weekly\nNVR                  -                  -                  -                  Continuous                  Continuous                  Continuous                  -\nSodium                -                -                -                  Continuous                Continuous                Continuous                 -\nBoron           Monthly           Monthly             Monthly             Quarterly              Weekly             -             -\nAnions &\nCations\nMonthly           Monthly             Monthly             Bi-weekly          Bi-weekly          Bi-weekly          -\nCritical\nIons\n1")),(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("pre",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("code",{parentName:"pre"},"                   -                          -                           -                          -                         -                        Bi-weekly\n")),(0,i.yg)("p",{parentName:"li"},"Trace\nMetals-\nCritical\n2"))),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Elements"),(0,i.yg)("ul",null,(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,i.yg)("pre",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.yg)("code",{parentName:"pre"},"                   -                          -                        Bi-weekly                        -                         -                        Bi-weekly\n")),"Trace\nMetals-\nFull Scan\nQuarterly          Quarterly            Quarterly          Quarterly            Monthly            Monthly            -\n1\nCritical Ions include Chloride, Fluoride, and Ammonium.")),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"2\nCritical Elements include Al, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Ni, Na, and Zn"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"NOTE  7:  The  frequency  noted  for  these  parameters  is  not  intended  to  assure  against  excursions  due  to  improper  maintenance\nprocedures or other external means of system contamination."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"NOTICE:    SEMI  makes  no  warranties  or  representations  as  to  the  suitability  of  the  standards  set  forth  herein  for\nany particular application.
