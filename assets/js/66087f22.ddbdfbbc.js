These   trending   components\noriginate   from   both   extrinsic   and   intrinsic   sources.\nExtrinsic trends arise from the rigid-body positioning of\nthe part under test in the measuring apparatus.  In optics\nthese displacement and rotation contributions are called\n\u201cpiston\u201d  and  \u201ctilt\u201d  errors.    In  contrast,  intrinsic  trends\narise from deliberate or accidental shape errors inherent\nin the surface under test, such as a circular or parabolic\ncurvature.  In the absence of a-priori information about\nthe  true  surface  shape,  the  intrinsic  shape  error  is\nfrequently  limited  to  a  quadratic  (parabolic)  curvature\nof  the  surface.    Detrending  of  intrinsic  and  extrinsic\ntrends  is  generally  accomplished  simultaneously  by\nsubtracting   a   detrending   polynomial   from   the   raw\nmeasured  data,  where  the  polynomial  coefficients  are\ndetermined  by  least-squares  fitting  to  the  measured\ndata.\n2. 9          Although     surfaces     and     surface     measuring\ninstruments exist in real or configuration space, they are\nmost easily understood in frequency space, also known\nas  Fourier  transform,  reciprocal  or  spatial-frequency\nspace.    This  is  because  any  practical  measurement\nprocess  can  be  considered  to  be  a  \u201clinear  system\u201d,\nmeaning that the measured profile is the convolution of\nthe true surface profile and the impulse response of the\nmeasuring   system;   and   equivalently,   the   Fourier-\namplitude   spectrum   of   the   measured   profile   is   the\nproduct  of  that  of  the  true  profile  and  the  frequency-\ndependent   \u201ctransfer   function\u201d   of   the   measurement\nsystem.

In  contrast,  the\nrange  of  spatial  frequencies  involved  in  optical  and\nmechanical  scanning  techniques  are  generally  much\nlarger than this, frequently having a dynamic ranges of\n512/1 or more.  In the latter case the subrange of 0.0125\nto  1  \u03bcm\n\u20131\nhas  been  used  to  discuss  the  rms  surface\nroughness   in   the   semiconductor   industry.

Such\nselections  are  application  dependent,  and  are  to  be\nmade at the users' discretion.\n2. 15        The    limits    of    integration    involved    in    the\ndetermination  of  rms  roughness  and  slope  values  from\nmeasured profile data are introduced by multiplying the\nmeasured PSD  by  a  factor  equal  to  zero  for  spatial\nfrequencies  outside  the  desired  bandpass  and  unity\nwithin  the  desired  bandpass,  as  shown  in  Case  (b)  in\nFigure  1.    This  is  called  a  top-hat  or  binary  filter\nfunction.      Before   the   ready   availability   of   digital\nfrequency-domain   processing   as   employed   in   this\nguide,  bandwidth  limits  were  imposed  by  passing  the\nprofile  data  through  analog  or  digital  filters  without\nexplicitly transforming them into the frequency domain\nand   multiplying   by   a   top-hat   function.      The   two\nprocesses  are  mathematically  equivalent,  providing  the\ndata  filter  has  the  desired  frequency  response.    Real\ndata  filters,  however,  frequently  have  Gaussian  or  RC\nforms  that  only  approximate  the  desired  top-hat  form\nthat  introduces  some  ambiguity  in  their  interpretation.\nThis   guide   recommends   the   determination   of   rms\nroughness and slope values using top-hat windowing of\nthe measured PSD in the frequency domain.\n2. 16  The PSD  and  rms  roughness  are  surface  statistics\nof  particular  interest  to  the  optics  and  semiconductor\nindustries  because  of  their  direct  relationship  to  the\nfunctional  properties  of  such  surfaces.

At the end of\nthis period, the cold trap is heated rapidly to release the\ntrapped  organics  to  the  GC  column  head.    Sample\ncomponents then are separated and eluted out of the GC\ncolumn.  Then, a portion goes to a phosphorus selective\ndetector and the remainder goes to a mass spectrometer\n(MS).    Blank  wafers  are  prepared  by  purging  out  any\nsurface   organic   contaminants   in   a   rapid   thermal\nannealer  or  a  high  temperature  furnace  while  a  purge\ngas is flowing.\n5. 1.2  Identification  of  Contaminants  \xf3  Identification\nof  individual  unknown  compounds  is  performed  by\ncorrespondence  of  retention  time  of  their  peaks  with\nthat  of  known  compounds.    Correspondence  of  reten-\ntion time on a single column should not be regarded as\nproof   of   identity.      More   precise   identification   of\nindividual  unknown  compounds  is  performed  with  MS\nby  matching  their  fragmentation  patterns  with  mass\nspectra of known compounds in the spectral library.\n5. 1.3  Quantification \xf3 Quantification of total organics\nis  based  on  the  comparison  of  the  integrated  total  peak\narea  of  the  sample  peaks  with  the  area  of  the  external\nstandard compound, n-C\n16\nH\n34\n.  Total organophosphorus\ncontent  in  a  sample  is  quantified  by  comparing  the\nsample  signal  integrated  from  the  phosphorus  selective\ndetector  with  the  signal  of  the  phosphorus  standard\ncompound,  tris  (2-chloroethyl)  phosphate  (TCEP)  or\ntributyl phosphate (TBP).  Specified range of standards\nis measured periodically, and the result is reported with\nblank wafer data.\n5. 2  Method B\n5. 2.1  Desorption  and  GC  Analysis  \xf3  The  volatile\norganic  contaminants  on  a  wafer  surface  are  desorbed\nthermally  from  the  wafer  surface  in  a  quartz  chamber\nunit and swept into a glass TD tube.  The glass TD tube\nthen  is  heated  for  a  set  period  and  a  stream  of  helium\nsweeps the volatile organic contaminants desorbed from\nthe   glass   TD   tube   to   a   cold   trap   where   they   are\npreconcentrated.  At the end of this period, the cold trap\nis  heated  rapidly  to  release  the  trapped  organics  to  the\nGC  column  head.    Sample  components  then  are  sepa-\nrated and eluted out of the GC column.  Then, a portion\ngoes   to   a   phosphorus   selective   detector   and   the\nremainder  goes  to  a  mass  spectrometer  (MS).    Blank\nwafers are prepared by purging out any surface organic\ncontaminants  in  the  heated  quartz  chamber  unit,  while\nhelium gas is flowing as a purge gas.\n5. 2.2  Identification  of  Contaminants  \xf3  Identification\nof  individual  unknown  compounds  is  performed  by\ncorrespondence  of  retention  time  of  their  peaks  with\nthat    of    known    compounds.

More   precise\nidentification   of   individual   unknown   compounds   is\nperformed  with  MS  by  matching  their  fragmentation\npatterns with mass spectra of known compounds in the\nspectral library.\n5. 2.3  Quantification \xf3 Quantification of total organics\nis  based  on  the  comparison  of  the  integrated  total  peak\narea  of  the  sample  peaks  with  the  area  of  the  external\nstandard compound, n-C\n16\nH\n34\n.  Total organophosphorus\ncontent  in  a  sample  is  quantified  by  comparing  the\nsample  signal  integrated  from  a  phosphorus  selective\ndetector  with  the  signal  of  the  phosphorus  standard\ncompound,  tris  (2-chloroethyl)  phosphate  (TCEP)  or\ntributyl phosphate (TBP).

In  order  to  desorb  any  organics  from  blank\nwafers,  the  temperature  of  a  rapid  thermal  annealer  is\nkept  at  900\u221eC  for  15  s,  or  the  temperature  of  a  high\ntemperature   furnace   is   kept   at   700\u221eC   for   30   min.\nHeating  under  air  or  oxygen  will  make  a  consistent\norganic-free  SiO\n2\nsurface.

The  portion  of\nthe  wafer  sample  needed  for  the  analysis  changes  with\nthe  size  of  the  wafer.    For  a  100-mm  wafer,  about  half\nof  its  surface  area  is  needed.    Larger  samples  (having\nlarger   surface   area)   may   be   used   to   increase   the\nsensitivity of the test.\n7. 1.2.4    Place  the  wafer  strips  of  wafer  into  the  wafer\ndesorption  tube.    Attach  a  sample  thermal  desorption\ntube  to  the  side  of  the  wafer  desorption  tube.    Connect\nthe other end of the wafer desorption tube to a nitrogen\nline with a flow of 15 to 100 mL/min.\n7. 1.2.5  Place the wafer desorption tube in the oven and\nheat  it  for  30  min  at  275\u221eC.    This  allows  the  volatile\norganics  to  be  thermally  desorbed  from  the  sample\nwafer  and  transferred  to  the  sample  thermal  desorption\ntube.\n7. 1.2.6  Seal both ends of the sample thermal desorption\ntube into the thermal desorption unit or by using caps if\nthe thermal desorption-GC system is automated.  Tubes\nmust  not  be  left  open  and  exposed  to  the  laboratory\natmosphere.  The end caps should be made of a material\nthat  has  low  outgassing  and  low  reactivity  properties,\nsuch  as  poly  tetrafluoroethylene  (PTFE),  or  stainless\nsteel.\n7. 1.2.7    Analyze  a  blank  wafer  at  least  daily.

Two\nrecommended    conditions    for    heating    the    sample\ndesorption  tube  are  as  follows.    When  graphitized\ncarbon  is  used  as  adsorbent  material,  heat  the  tube  to\n400\u221eC and hold at 400\u221eC for 15 min.

Cold  trap  parameters,  that  is,  sorbent,  sold\ntemperature, etc., should be selected such that all target\nanalytes  are  retained  quantitatively  throughout  the  tube\ndesorption  process,  for  example,  using  a  cold  trap\ntemperature of \u221230\u221eC.  Refer to ASTM Practice D 6196\nfor   a   method   for   testing   desorption   efficiency   and\nanalyte  recovery.    At  the  end  of  this  period,  heat  the\ncold trap rapidly to 300\u221eC to release the target organics\nto the GC column head.\nNOTE  3:    For  higher  sensitivity  analysis,  larger  sample  sizes\ncan be used, but clogging by water is possible.  In this case, a\nsubambient  cold  trap  with  an  adsorbent  may  be  used  and\nmaintained higher than 0\u221eC during trapping to prevent freeze-\nup of trap.\n7. 1.3.3    Separate  volatile  organics  desorbed  from  the\nsample   thermal   desorption   tube   by   an   appropriate\ncolumn   temperature   program.

All  CTS  times  must  be  at  least  4\nminutes to allow full movement of the mobile ions.\n6. 1.3      Three   additional   identical   test   sequences   are\nexecuted  to  collect  data  to  evaluate  performance  of  the\ninstrument.\nNOTE  1:    The  bias,  temperature  and  time  used  for  the  last\nCTS prior to carrying out the above tests should be employed\nfor these test sequences.\n6. 1.4  Performance   of   the   NCDCS   and   its   selected\ncomponents  is  checked  by  measuring  the  following\ncharacteristics:  initial  surface  voltage  (V\nsurf\n),  flatband\nvoltage (V\nfb\n), effective charge (Q\neff\n), density of interface\ntraps (D\nit\n), mobile charge (Q\nm\n), and electrical dielectric\nthickness (T\nox\n).\n6. 1.5    Measurements  are  made  at  three  points  on  the\nsurface  of  the  wafer  and  the  mean,  standard  deviation\nand relative standard deviation of the results obtained in\nthe   three   identical   sequences   (Section   6.1.3   )   are\ncomputed and recorded.\n6. 1.6      The   results   are   compared   with   the   values\nsupplied with the special reference wafer to evaluate the\nNCDCS performance.\n6. 1.7    If  it  is  desired  to  check  the  system  over  its  full\nrange of operation, this procedure is repeated using two\nor   more   additional   special   reference   wafers   with\nparameters  that  cover  the  typical  parameter  ranges  in\nSection 7.4 .\n6. 1.8  Short-cycle  Time  Modification  of  Method  A  \xf3\nThe  short-cycle  time  modification  is  performed  in  the\nsame  manner  except  that  the  measurement  of  Q\nm\nis\ncarried out first, in order to assure consistent alignment\nof  the  mobile  ions  prior  to  the  other  measurements.\nThe Q\nm\nmeasurement  is  followed  by  the  measurement\nof the other parameters.  No repetitions are required; the\ntest sequence in this modification is only run once.\n6. 2  Method B\n6. 2.1    First  any  remaining  residual  charge  on  a  special\nreference  wafer  is  neutralized  by  immersing  it  in  DI\nwater.\n6. 2.2    Then  the  special  reference  wafer  is  loaded  into\nthe  NSCDS  and  the  surface  voltage  (contact  potential\ndifference) is zeroed to within \xb1 0.3 V.\n6. 2.3  Then the steps in Sections 6.1.2 \xf16.1.4 and 6.1.6\nare followed.\n6. 2.4    If  it  is  desired  to  check  the  system  over  its  full\nrange of operation, this procedure is repeated using two\nor   more   additional   special   reference   wafers   with"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF2166-0304 \xa9 SEMI 2004 4\nparameters  that  cover  the  typical  parameter  ranges  in\nSection 7.4 .\n6. 2.5  Short-cycle  Time  Modification  of  Method  B  \xf3\nThe  short-cycle  time  modification  is  performed  in  the\nsame  manner  except  that  the  measurement  of  Q\nm\nis\ncarried out first, in order to assure consistent alignment\nof  the  mobile  ions  prior  to  the  other  measurements.\nThe Q\nm\nmeasurement  is  followed  by  the  measurement\nof the other parameters.

Only  a  single  mobile  ion  run\nis carried out.\n7  Special Reference Wafers\n7. 1  Fabricate the special reference wafers (SRW) from\np-type silicon with a multi-layer dielectric including an\nembedded  layer  of  mobile  ions  confined  to  the  top\nportion of the dielectric.  These mobile ions drift during\ntemperature-bias  stressing.    Since  the  drift  occurs  only\nin  the  top  of  the  dielectric,  the  Kelvin  (Monroe)  probe\neasily  senses  a  shift  in  V\nsurf\n(V\ncpd\n)  for  the  mobile  ion\nconcentration calculation.  Confining the mobile ions to\nthe top of the dielectric also ensures that measurements\nassociated  with  the  silicon-dielectric  interface  are  left\nunchanged after the mobile ion test.\n7. 2    Limit  the  thickness  of  the  dielectric  on  the  special\nreference  wafers  to  between  30  and  70  nm,  to  provide\nsufficient  distance  for  the  mobile  ions  to  drift  while\nremaining clear of the interface.\n7. 3    Ensure  the  dielectric  is  rugged  enough  so  that\nrepeated use, for example, once a day for six months, of\nthe  same  test  sites  does  not  result  in  shifts  in  electrical\nparameters.\n7. 3.1  Check parameter drift every 6 months.  Parameter\ndrift  over  time  should  be  less  than  10%  in  six  months.\nIf drift exceeds this value, replace the special reference\nwafers.\n7. 3.2          Test     wafers     must     be     re-calibrated     and\ndocumented semi-annually by testing the wafers on two\ndocumented  NCDCSs  that  have  been  maintained  using\nthis  Practice.    The  results  must  match  within  10%.    If\nthe   results   exceed   this   value,   replace   the   special\nreference wafers.\n7. 4  Test Parameter Ranges \xf3 p-type special reference\nwafers  should  have  parameters  appropriate  for  the  test\napplication.
