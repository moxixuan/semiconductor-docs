APPENDIX 3
NEW EDI STATISTICS (DEFINITIONS)
NOTICE:  The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI T6 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures.
A3-1  Additions to ANSI’s Statistical Codes to be Included within this Standard
A3-1.1  These new statistical codes are added to a predefined ANSI list of summary statistics found in Appendix 3
under the transaction segment STA. The codes are HS, HW, HC, GM, GS, PK, EC, OC, and PE and are submitted
to  ANSI  for  approval.  The  codes  can  be  used  in  an  EDI  message  as  long  as  the  trading  partners  agree  to  include
them  as  part  of  their  transmissions.  Once  the  codes  are  approved,  the  ASC  X12  convention  will  be  updated  to
automatically accept these codes as standards.
A3-1.2  Histogram Information
A3-1.2.1  HS = Histogram Start (Left side of first class or bar)
A3-1.2.2  HW = Histogram Class Width (Width of class or bar)
A3-1.2.3  HC = Histogram Class Count (Count of classes or bars)
A3-1.3  Process Capability Information
A3-1.3.1  GM = Geometric Mean (GMEAN). For the lognormal distribution, it’s calculated as:
TMEAN = The mean of the natural log of the raw data values
GMEAN = EXP(TMEAN+ (TSIGMA<strong>2)/2)
A3-1.3.2  GS = Geometric Sigma (GSIGMA). For the lognormal distribution, it’s calculated as:
TSIGMA = The sigma of the natural log of the raw data values
GSIGMA = SQRT((EXP((2*TMEAN)+(TSIGMA</strong>2)))<strong>EXP((TSIGMA</strong>2))-1))
A3-1.3.3  PK  =  The  peak  of  the  fitted  probability  distribution  function.  It’s  calculated  as  the  maximum  Y
value of the probability distribution function after it is fitted to the process histogram.
A3-1.3.4  EC = The equivalent normal Cpk (ECPK). For the lognormal distribution, it’s calculated as:
ECPK     =     ((LN(USL))-LN((GMEAN<strong>2/(SQRT(GMEAN</strong>2+GSIGMA<strong>2))))/     (3*SQRT(LN
(GMEAN</strong>2)/ GMEAN**2)))
A3-1.4  Outlier Information
A3-1.4.1  OC = Outlier Count. It may be calculated as A minus B, where A = the count beyond a chosen
sigma  point  using  the  histogram,  and  B  =  the  count  beyond  the  chosen  sigma  point  using  the  statistical
distribution.
A3-1.5  Percentile Information
A3-1.5.1  PE = Percentile. Like the HG, it can be repeated to give different elements. The user and supplier
need to agree on the order for a particular application.</p><p>SEMI T6-0697 © SEMI 1997, 2004 7
APPENDIX 4
EDI TRANSMISSION COMPONENTS (863 REPORT OF TEST
RESULTS)
NOTICE:  The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI T6 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures.
A4-1  Introduction
A4-1.1  The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  provide  the
necessary  information  to  enable  trading  partners  to  use
the  ASC  X12  standards  for  the  exchange  of  electronic
business documents within the electronics industry.
A4-1.2  The  transmission,  in  the  ASC  X12  format,  is
comprised of an outer envelope (transmission envelope)
which  identifies  the  sender  and  receiver.  Within  the
transmission   envelope   are   one   or   more   functional
groups.
A4-1.3  The functional groups are analogous to batches
of  like  documents  (i.e.,  certificate  of  analysis,  test
results,   statistical   results).   Each   functional   group
contains   one   or   more   transaction   sets   (electronic
documents).    Each    transaction    set    is    an    ordered
collection  of  segments.  Each  segment  is  an  ordered
collection of data elements.
A4-1.4  Each segment has been assigned a two or three
charac-ter identifier.
A4-1.5  This  identifier  marks  the  beginning  of  each
segment. Each element within the segment is separated
by   a   data   element   separator   character.   Electronic
Industry Data Exchange (EIDX) recommends the use of
the asterisk (*) character as a data element separator. A
segment terminator character is used to mark the end of
a segment.
A4-2  Format
A4-2.1    The  ASC  X12  segment  hierarchy  lists  all
segments,   in   order,   available   from   the   ASC   X12
standard. The segment ID’s that are shaded indicate the
segments  utilized  by  EIDX.  Following  the  ASC  X12
segment  hierarchy  is  a  detailed  description  of  each
segment in the order that they appear in the transaction
set.
A4-2.2  Each segment is listed with the segment ID and
name,  level  (header,  detail,  or  summary),  loop  (if  the
segment is contained within a loop), loop repeat (for the
first   segment   in   the   loop),   requirement   within   the
transaction  set,  maximum  use,  purpose  (as  defined  by
ASC   X12),   ASC   X12   syntax   notes,   ASC   X12
comments for segment usage, and notes that explain the
EDIX    convention    for    this    segment    within    the
transaction set. It is important to note all shaded text is
either   an   EDIX   convention   or   EDIX   terminology.
Shaded  coded  lists  refer  to  recommendations  culled
from  the  entire  ASC  X12  data  element  code  list.  The
unshaded areas contain definitions and comments from
the ASC X12 standard.
A4-2.3    The  data  element  summary  lists  each  data
element,   in   order,   for   the   segment;   for   each   data
element    there    is    one    line    to    identify    reference
designator,  data  element  number,  data  element  name,
and attributes.
A4-2.4    Below  the  one  line  summary  are  usage  notes
and ac-tual values identified for use.
A4-2.5    Reference  Designator  —  This  is  the  segment
identifier   with   the   data   element   sequence   number
within the segment.
A4-2.6    Data  Element  Number  —  This  is  the  number
assigned to the data element by ASC X12. This number
may  be  used  for  direct  refer-ence  into  the  ASC  X12
Data Dictionary.
A4-2.7    Data  Element  Name  —  This  is  the  name
assigned  to  the  data  element  by  ASC  X12,  in  the  ASC
X12 Data Dictionary.
A4-2.8  Attributes — Each data element has three ANSI
attributes:     element     usage,     element     type,     and
Minimum/Maximum length.
A4-2.9  Element Usage
M   Mandatory   Designer
This  is  the  segment  identifier  with  the  data
element sequence number within the segment.
O    Optional
The  data  element  may  be  used  if  the  segment
is used.
X    Conditional
The  data  element  may  be  used  only  if  other
elements are used within the segment.
The particular condition/relation will be stated
in the Data Element Summary for the segment
when used.</p><p>SEMI T6-0697 © SEMI 1997, 2004 8
A4-2.10  Element Type
ID   Identifier
Values for the identifier-type data elements are
taken  from  a  predefined  list  in  the  ASC  X12
data element dictionary.
AN  String
Values  for  the  string-type  data  elements  are  a
sequence of any printable characters.
DT  Date
Values  for  a  date-type  data  element  are  in  the
format YYMMDD.
TM Time
Values  for  a  time-type  data  element  are  in  the
format HHMM expressed in a 24-hour clock.
Nx  Numeric
Values  for  a  numeric  data  element  are  in  an
implied  decimal  format,  where  &quot;X&quot;  indicates
the   number   of   places   to   the   right   of   the
decimal point.
i.e.,
N0 is a whole number (999.)
N2 is 999.99
R    Decimal
This  is  a  numeric  field  in  character  format,
with  a  decimal  point  included.  It  is  treated  as
alpha/numeric.  The  decimal  point  is  not  sent
for whole numbers.
e.g.,
to  send  the  number  0128.734,  the  field  would
contain &quot;128.734&quot;.
to  send  the  number  0789.00,  the  field  would
contain &quot;789&quot;.
A4-2.11  Minimum/Maximum
This is the minimum and maximum length the field can
be.
e.g.,
02/02 - fixed length of 2 characters.
04/09 - Minimum length of 4 characters and maximum
length of 9 characters.</p><p>SEMI T6-0697 © SEMI 1997, 2004 9

SPECIFICATION FOR BACK SURFACE MARKING OF DOUBLE-SIDE
POLISHED WAFERS WITH A TWO-DIMENSIONAL MATRIX CODE
SYMBOL
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Traceability  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Traceability  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American Traceability Committee on November 22, 2002.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> January 2003;
to be published March 2003.  Originally published in 1997; previously published November 2002.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  This specification is intended to provide a marking
symbology that can be used to mark silicon wafers with
no intrusion into the fixed quality area of the wafer.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This specification defines the geometric and spatial
relationships  and  content  (including  the  error  checking
and  correcting  code)  of  a  rectangular  two-dimensional
(2-D),   machine-readable,   binary   data   matrix   code
symbol  for  back  surface  marking  of  notched,  double-
side  polished  wafers  of  silicon  which  comply  with
SEMI M1.15, and other materials with diameters of 300
mm and larger.</li><li>2    Although  this  specification  does  not  specify  the
marking   techniques   that   may   be   employed   when
complying  with  its  requirements,  it  is  assumed  that  the
symbol  will  be  obtained  by  laser  scribing  individual
dots.</li><li>3    The  matrix  code  is  applicable  to  a  broad  range  of
wafer  products  including  epitaxial  wafers,  SOI  wafers,
and   unpatterned   or   patterned   polished   wafers.   The
format  and  algorithms  of  this  code  are  based  on  two-
dimensional symbology specified in ISO/IEC 16022.
NOTICE: This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  health  practices  and  determine  the

4. 1.10  data  matrix  code  symbol  —  a  two-dimensional
array  of  square  cells  arranged  in  contiguous  rows  and
columns.  In  certain  ECC200  symbols,  data  regions  are
separated  by  alignment  patterns.  The  data  region  is
surrounded by a finder pattern <!-- -->[ISO/IEC 16022]<!-- -->.
4. 1.11  dot  —  a  localized  region  with  a  reflectance
which differs from that of the surrounding surface.
NOTE  1:    To  assure  reading  efficiency,  a  minimum  contrast
of 30% is required between the reflectance value of a dot and
the  surrounding  wafer  surface.  Various  densitometers  can
provide such measurements nondestructively.

define  physical  size,  orientation  and  symbol  distortion.
The two opposite sides are made up of cells containing
dots in alternate cells <!-- -->[ISO/IEC 16022]<!-- -->.
4. 1.14  reference point, of a data matrix code symbol —
the physical center point of a corner cell common to the
primary  border  row  and  the  solid  line  of  the  alignment
bar, used to identify the physical location of the symbol
on the object being marked with the symbol.
NOTE  2:    The  reference  point  is  at  a  fixed  location  on  the
object.  Different  cells  may  be  chosen  as  the  reference  point
depending  on  the  desired  orientation  of  the  symbol  on  the
object  and  the  size  variability  of  the  symbol.  The  particular
cell  to  be  used  as  the  reference  point  must  be  specified  for
each application.

SPECIFICATION FOR MARKING OF GLASS FLAT PANEL DISPLAY
SUBSTRATES WITH A TWO-DIMENSIONAL MATRIX CODE SYMBOL
This  specification  was  technically  reapproved  by  the  Global  Traceability  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Traceability  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  16,  2004.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>
September 2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published June 1998.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  This specification is intended to provide a marking
symbology  that  can  be  used  to  mark  glass  flat  panel
display (FPD) substrates within the fixed quality area of
the edge exclusion area of the substrate.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This specification defines the geometric and spatial
relationships  and  content  (including  the  error  checking
and correcting code) of rectangular two-dimensional (2-
D),  machine-readable,  binary  Data  Matrix  symbology
for front-surface or back-surface marking of glass FPD
substrates  (sometimes  called  “motherglass”  substrates)
which  comply  with  the  edge  specifications  of  SEMI
D12.   It   may   be   used   in   conjunction   with   the
alphanumeric  marking  codes  specified  in  SEMI  M12
and SEMI M13 or the bar code specified in SEMI T1.</li><li>2  Although  this  specification  does  not  specify  the
marking   techniques   that   may   be   employed   when
complying  with  its  requirements,  it  is  assumed  that  the
symbol  will  be  obtained  by  laser  scribing  individual
dots. A survivability experiment executed by the United
States Display Consortium found such marks suitable.
NOTE 1:  Other techniques could include resist exposure and
grit blasting.</li><li>3  Data  Matrix  symbology  is  applicable  to  a  broad
range   of   FPD   products   including   virgin   substrates,
processed  and  patterned  substrates,  panel  assemblies,
and   displays.   An   application   note   describes   the
application  of  Data  Matrix  symbology  to  individual
panel    sections    contained    within    a    multi-panel
motherglass  substrate.  The  format  and  algorithms  of
this  code  are  based  on  two-dimensional  symbology
specified      in      AIM      International      Symbology
Specification - Data Matrix.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

4. 1.2  binary  values  —  a  dot  in  the  substrate  surface
indicates the binary value 1. The absence of a dot, or a
smooth   surface   surrounding   a   cell   center   point,
indicates the binary value 0.
4. 1.3  border column — the outermost column of a data
matrix  code  symbol.  This  column  is  a  portion  of  the
finder pattern.
4. 1.4  border row — the outermost row of a data matrix
code symbol. This row is a portion of the finder pattern.
4. 1.5  cell,  of  a  data  matrix  code  symbol  —  the  area
within  which  a  dot  may  be  placed  to  indicate  a  binary
value.
4. 1.6  cell  center  point,  of  an  array  —  the  point  at
which the centerline of a row intersects the centerline of
a column.
4. 1.7  cell spacing, of an array — the (equal) vertical or
horizontal  distance  between  the  cell  center  points  of
contiguous cells.
4. 1.8  center  line,  of  a  row  or  column  —  the  line
positioned  parallel  to,  and  spaced  equally  between,  the
boundary lines of the row or column.
4. 1.9  central  area,  of  a  cell  —  the  area  enclosed  by  a
circle  centered  at  the  cell  center  point;  used  by  code
readers to sense the binary value of the cell.
4. 1.10  data  matrix  code  symbol  —  a  two-dimensional
array  of  square  cells  arranged  in  contiguous  rows  and
columns.  In  certain  ECC200  symbols,  data  regions  are
separated  by  alignment  patterns.  The  data  region  is
surrounded   by   a   finder   pattern   (AIM   International
Symbology Specification - Data Matrix).
4. 1.11   dot  —  a  localized  region  with  a  reflectance
which differs from that of the surrounding surface.
NOTE 2:  To  assure  reading  efficiency,  a  minimum  contrast
of 30% is required between the reflectance value of a dot and
the  surrounding  substrate  surface.  Various  densitometers  can
provide such measurements non-destructively.
4. 1.12  dot  misalignment,  within  a  cell  —  the  distance
between  the  physical  center  point  of  a  dot  and  the  cell
center point.
4. 1.13  finder pattern, of a data matrix code symbol —
a  perimeter  to  the  data  region.  Two  adjacent  sides
contain  dots  in  every  cell;  these  are  used  primarily  to
define physical size, orientation, and symbol distortion.
The two opposite sides are made up of cells containing
dots  in  alternate  cells  (AIM  International  Symbology
Specification - Data Matrix).
4. 1.14  reference point, of a data matrix code symbol —
the   physical   center   point   of   a   cell   common   to   a
designated   row   and   column,   used   to   identify   the
physical  location  of  the  symbol  on  the  object  being
marked with the symbol.
NOTE 3:  The  reference  point  is  at  a  fixed  location  on  the
object.  Different  cells  may  be  chosen  as  the  reference  point,
depending  on  the  desired  orientation  of  the  symbol  on  the
object and on the size variability of the symbol. The particular
cell  to  be  used  as  the  reference  point  must  be  specified  for
each application.

APPENDIX 1
PLACEMENT OF DATA MATRIX CODES ON DISPLAY SECTIONS OF
FLAT PANEL DISPLAY SUBSTRATES
NOTICE: This appendix was approved as an official part of SEMI T8, but the recommendations in this appendix
are optional and are not required to conform to this standard.
A1-1  The following suggests one way in which individual display sections could be marked while still a part of the
motherglass substrate. Figure A1-1 illustrates a six-up display layout on a 550 × 650 mm substrate.</p><p>Figure A1-1
An Example of Mark Field Locations in Individual Display
Sections within a “Motherglass” Substrate</p><p>A1-2  The Substrate ID location falls within the edge exclusion area as detailed in Figure 4. In this example, all ID
fields  are  located  on  the  back  (non-pattern)  surface.  Placing  them  on  the  same  surface  as  the  substrate  mark  can
simplify  ID  reading  during  fabrication.  Their  location  on  the  non-pattern  surface  could  allow  ID  reading  of  the
outside surface of a display after assembly.
A1-3  The axes of the individual display IDs are parallel to the substrate ID axes. Each display ID is located adjacent
to a display corner. The locations of each ID field are given.
NOTE A1-1: This example does not constitute a recommended usage, but is intended to assist users in developing ID locations
suitable for their operations

SPECIFICATION FOR MARKING OF METAL LEAD-FRAME STRIPS
WITH A TWO-DIMENSIONAL DATA MATRIX CODE SYMBOL
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Traceability  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Traceability  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  July  11,  2004.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  September
2004; to be published November 2004.  Originally published in 1998; previously published April 2000.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  This  specification  provides  a  marking  symbology
that can be used to mark metal lead-frame strips.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This specification defines the geometric and spatial
relationships  and  content  (including  the  error  checking
and correcting code) of rectangular two-dimensional (2-
D),  machine-readable,  binary  Data  Matrix  symbology
for  front-surface  marking  of  metal  lead-frame  strips
(also  called  “strips”).  It  may  be  used  in  conjunction
with   the   alphanumeric   marking   codes   specified   in
SEMI M12 and SEMI M13 or the bar code specified in
SEMI T1.</li><li>2  This  specification  defines  a  22-character  default
message that is included in all marks, and option for up
to  50  additional  characters,  for  a  total  of  72  message
characters.  An  optional  shorter  message  contains  12  to
16  message  characters;  the  resulting  square  field  is
narrower  but  taller  than  the  22-character  rectangular
one.</li><li>3  This specification provides a suggested location for
the   code   symbol.   It   also   provides   guidelines   for
specifying  other  code  locations  when  the  suggested
location is not suitable for an application.</li><li>4  Although  this  specification  does  not  specify  the
marking   techniques   that   may   be   employed   when
complying  with  its  requirements,  it  is  assumed  that  the
symbol  will  be  obtained  by  laser  scribing  individual
dots.
NOTE 1:  A    mark    survivability    experiment    is    being
conducted   by   the   SEMI   North   American   Traceability
committee.   A   report   is   available   from   SEMI:   request
“Leadframe   Mark   Survivability   Report”   dated   February,</li></ol><h1>1999</h1><ol start="1999"><li></li><li>5  Data  Matrix  symbology  is  applicable  to  a  broad
range  of  lead-frame  materials  including  copper  and
Alloy 42 in both bare and plated conditions. The format
and   algorithms   of   this   code   are   based   on   two-
dimensional  symbology  specified  in  AIM  International
Symbology Specification - Data Matrix.</li><li>6  This  specification  supports  EIA  Package  Marking
Specification by enabling individual die tracking in the
manufacturing  steps  between  die  attach  and  device
packaging marking.
NOTE 2:  Marking  of  each  die,  while  in  wafer  form,  prior  to
dicing, could also accomplish this end.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
