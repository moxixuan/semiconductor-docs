Consider all the records in the data file from START\_ORDERthrough END\_ORDER, inclusive. Consider each ASCII character up to and including the new\_line character.Convert each character to its ASCII numeric equivalent (e.g., space is 32 decimal, A is 65 decimal, etc.) Use thevalue 10 decimal for the new\_line function regardless of its internal representation (e.g., CR LF). Use only the 7 bitASCII representation for each character (i.e., ignore the high order bit in an 8 bit byte).9.1.2 XOR each of the characters from each of the records in sequence, from the first character in theSTART\_ORDER record to the new\_line character in the END\_ORDER record. Before each character is XORedwith the checksum, circularly rotate the previous value of the accumulated 16 bit checksum one bit to the left.9.1.3 After all of the above characters have been accumulated into the checksum, convert it as an unsigned 16 bitinteger into the ASCII representation of its decimal value. This ASCII string is the data field following theCHECKSUM keyword, the last record in the mask order structure.

SEMI P10-0705 © SEMI 1990, 2005153 CD\_DEVIATION\_FROM\_TARGET  Maximum acceptable deviation of any ofthe customer-required CD measurements from the CD\_TARGET.If only one data value (p) appears in the data field, the tolerance is considered +/-symmetrically about CD\_TARGET.If two data values ( p \[,m\] ) appear, then the first is the maximum amount bywhich deviation is allowed larger than CD\_TARGET, and the second is themaximum amount by which deviation is allowed smaller than CD\_TARGET. Thecomma and second half of the argument are optional in the syntax (p\[,m\]) wherep = the plus and m = the minus value for non-symmetric tolerances; if only p isspecified, the plus and minus values are assumed to be symmetric. p p p m CD\_THREE\_SIGMA  Maximum acceptable 3-sigma deviation of all measuredcritical dimensions to the the mean of all measured critical dimensions CD\_XY\_DEVIATION  Maximum deviation, on a site-by-site basis, of ahorizontal critical dimension to a vertical critical dimension.

The TOP\_CELL's role in the P10 Standard is to provide a means to list and locate all of the! Patterns on the Mask. Within the TOP\_CELL Cell ID section (below) both Patterns and other Cells! can be listed. The value for the Top Cell is given by the PLACEMENT\_TOP\_CELL keyword in the! MASK\_GROUP section above.!! This example lays out each component of the Mask using the "CELL\_INSTANCE" keyword.! Each Ultratech Field is represented by a "FLD\_x" designation for a Cell Instance, where "x" is! the field number. The general idea is to designate a cell for each Field separately and to let! the MASK\_PATTERNS cell hold the remaining data. In this example the FLD\_1 cell contains Field 1,! the FLD\_2 cell holds Field 2, and the MASK\_PATTERNS cell holds Barcode, BOJ, EOJ, Fiducial,! and Logo data. Other types of Patterns could also be included in the MASK\_PATTERNS cell.!!!----------CELLS--------------------------
