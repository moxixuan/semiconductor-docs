SEMI C27-0301 © SEMI 1978, 2001HYDROCHLORIC ACID2
Chromosorb P (80/100), 3 m ×  3  mm  stainless  steel  or
glass;  injection  port  at  280°C  with  glass  insert;  column
temperature  initially  65°C,  programmed  at  6°C/min  up
to  140°C;  carrier  gas  —  nitrogen  at  40  mL/min;  signal
adjusted   to   give   an   80%   full-scale   deflection;   and
preferably,  electronic  integration  of  peak  areas.  For
DDT:   Column   —   5%   silicone   gum   SESE-30   on
Chromosorb W (60/80), 1.5 × 3 mm, injection port —
as  above;  column  temperature  —  isothermal  at  205°C;
carrier  gas  —  nitrogen  at  75  mL/min,  and  preferably,
electronic   integration   of   peak   areas.   The   order   of
elution  is  2,2,4-trimethylpentane,  carbon  tetrachloride,
benzene,  chloroform,  2,2,4-trimethylpentane  impurity,
1,2-dichloroethane,     chlorobenzene,     and     dichloro-
benzene.  The  total  area  under  the  impurity  peaks  from
the  sample  should  be  no  greater  than  that  from  the
blank  (extract  from  second  funnel)  by  more  than  one-
half  the  total  area  under  the  peaks  from  the  standard
(third funnel), also corrected for the blank.
8. 3.1  Standard — Use a syringe to a dd the volumes of
liquid   listed   in   Table   2   into   300   mL   of   2,2,4-
trimethylpentane.  Add  25  mg  of  DDT  to  the  solution.
Dilute  to  500  mL  with  2,2,4-trimethylpentane.  The
2,2,4-trimethylpentane  used  for  both  the  standard  and
the analysis should be free from impurities that interfere
with the chromatographic analysis.
8. 4   Free  Halogen  (as  Cl
2
)  —  Mix   100  mL  of  sample
and  100  mL  of  freshly  boiled  water  and  cool.  Add  0.1
mL of 2% potassium iodide reagent solution and 1 mL
of  carbon  disulfide,  and  mix.  The  carbon  disulfide
should not acquire a pink color in one-half minute.
8. 5   Phosphate  —  To  170  mL  (200   g)  of  sample,  add
10   mL   of   sodium   carbonate   reagent   solution   and
evaporate   to   dryness   on   a   steam   bath   in   a   hood.
Dissolve  the  residue  in  25  mL  of  0.5  N  sulfuric  acid.
Add  1  mL  of  ammonium  molybdate  reagent  solution
and 1 mL of p-(methylamino)phenol solution. Allow to
stand  at  room  temperature  for  2  hours.  Any  blue  color
produced should be no greater than that produced when
0. 01  mg  of  phosphate  ion  (PO
4
)  is  treated  like  the
sample.
8. 6  Sulfate — To 84 mL (100 g) o f sample, add 10 mL
of  sodium  carbonate  reagent  solution  and  evaporate  to
dryness  in  a  hood.  Dissolve  the  residue  in  10  mL  of
water  and  1  mL  of  dilute  hydrochloric  acid  (1  +  19);
filter,   if   necessary.   Add   1   mL   of   barium   chloride
reagent  solution,  mix,  and  allow  to  stand  10  minutes.
Any  turbidity  should  be  no  greater  than  that  produced
when  0.05  mg  of  sulfate  ion  (SO
4
)  is  treated  as  the
sample.
8. 7   Sulfite  —  Add  1  mL  of  10  perc ent  potassium
iodide reagent solution, 5 mL of hydrochloric acid, and
2 mL of starch indicator solution to 400 mL of oxygen-
free  water.  Add  0.01  N  iodine  until  a  faint  permanent
blue  color  is  produced.  Add  85  mL  of  the  sample  and
titrate  with  0.01  N  iodine  to  the  same  endpoint.  Not
more than 0.20 mL should be required.
8. 8  Arsenic and Antimony (as As)  — To 168 mL (200
g)  of  sample  in  a  400  mL  beaker,  add  10  mL  of  nitric
acid  and  5  mL  of  sulfuric  acid,  and  evaporate  to  dense
fumes of sulfur trioxide in a hood. Cool, cautiously add
10 mL of water, and again evaporate to dense fumes of
sulfur   trioxide.   Cool   and   cautiously   wash   into   a
generator flask with water to make a volume of 35 mL.
Proceed as described in the General Method for Arsenic
(and Antimony) under SEMI C1, Section 3.4.5, starting
with  tile  sentence  which  begins:  “Swirl  the  flask....”
Any   red   color   in   the   silver   diethyldithiocarbamate
solution from the sample should be no greater than that
of the standard containing 0.001 mg of arsenic (As).
8. 9   Trace  Metal  Analysis  —  The  f ollowing  method
has  given  satisfactory  results  in  determing  trace  metal
impurities   at   the   value   specified   for   each   of   the
following   trace   metals:   aluminum   (Al),   boron   (B),

ultra  pure  nitric  acid  to  1  L  using  water  meeting  the
criteria for Type E1.1 in ASTM D5127.
8. 9.2  Sample Preparation
8. 9.2.1   In  a  clean  environment,  place   250  mL  of
sample  in  a  PTFE  evaporating  dish.  Slowly  evaporate
on a hot plate, avoiding loss of sample by effervescence
or   spattering   until   approximately   2   mL   of   liquid
remains. Note: Evaporation typically requires 2 1/2 to 4
hours.   Cool.   Transfer   quantitatively   to   a   50   mL
volumetric  flask  using  2%  nitric  acid  for  rinsing  and
dilution to volume. Run a reagent blank.
8. 9.3  Analysis
8. 9.3.1   Using  the  acid  sample  and  reag ent  blank,
analyze  group  1  elements  by  flame  atomic  absorption
spectroscopy and all other elements by plasma emission
spectroscopy.

hydrogen peroxide used in the semiconductor industry.
2. 2  The  VLSI  grade  purity  level  is  typically  required
by  semiconductor  devices  with  geometries  of  0.8–1.2
microns.
2. 3  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  The    specification    for    VLSI    grade    hydrogen
peroxide  is  only  applicable  for  materials  that  remain

g) of sample in a 400 mL beaker, add 5 mL of sulfuric
acid and evaporate to dense fumes of sulfur trioxide in a
hood.  Cool,  cautiously  add  10  mL  of  water,  and  again
evaporate  to  dense  fumes  of  sulfur  trioxide.  Cool,  and
cautiously  wash  into  a  generator  flask  with  water  to
make  a  volume  of  35  mL.  Proceed  as  described  in
General  Method  for  Arsenic  (and  Antimony)  under
SEMI C1, Section 3.4.5, starting with the first sentence
which begins: “Swirl the flask....” Any red color in the
silver  diethyldithiocarbamate  solution  from  the  sample

8. 7   Solubility  in  Water  —  Mix  15  m L  of  sample  with
45  mL  of  water.  Allow  to  stand  for  30  minutes.  The
solution should be as clear as an equal volume of water.
8. 8  Boron — To 127 mL (100 g) o f sample, add 0.10
mL  of  10%  sodium  hydroxide  solution,  and  evaporate
to  dryness  in  a  nitrogen  atmosphere  using  a  covered
chamber  such  as  a  Thiers  assembly  (or  equivalent).
Dissolve the residue with 2 mL of water and 0.10 mL of
hydrochloric acid. Transfer to a test tube, cool in an ice
bath, and add 10 mL of sulfuric acid. Then add 10 mL
of carminic acid solution and remove from the ice bath.

volume  in  a  hood.  Add  50  mL  of  water  and  again
evaporate  to  a  small  volume.  Repeat  the  evaporation
with water addition. Do not allow to go to dryness. Add
5  mL  of  nitric  acid  and  5  mL  of  sulfuric  acid  and
evaporate  to  dense  fumes  of  sulfur  trioxide.  Cool,
cautiously  add  10  mL  of  water,  and  again  evaporate  to
dense  fumes  of  sulfur  trioxide.  Cool,  and  cautiously
wash  into  a  generator  flask  with  water  to  make  a
volume  of  35  mL.  Proceed  as  described  in  the  General
Method  for  Arsenic  (and  Antimony)  under  SEMI  C1,
Section  3.4.5,  starting  with  the  sentence  which  begins:
“Swirl   the   flask....”   Any   red   color   in   the   silver
diethyldithiocarbamate solution from the sample should
be no greater than that of the standard containing 0.002
mg of arsenic (As).
8. 12  Trace Metal Analysis
8. 12.1    Gold   (Au)   —   Analyze   by   grap hite   atomic
absorption   using   the   manufacturer's   recommended
procedure.  This  technique  has  been  shown  to  give
satisfactory  results  using  a  1:4  dilution  and  Zeeman
background correction. Each laboratory must determine
the  appropriate  dilution  and  background  correction  for
its instrument to meet the specification limit.
8. 12.2   The  following  method  has  giv en  satisfactory
results  in  determining  trace  metal  impurities  at  the
value  specified  for  each  of  the  following  trace  metals:
aluminum  (Al),  calcium  (Ca),  chromium  (Cr),  copper
(Cu), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), magnesium (Mg), manganese
(Mn), nickel (Ni), potassium (K), sodium (Na), tin (Sn),
titanium (Ti), and zinc (Zn). Alternate methods may be
used   as   long   as   appropriate   studies   demonstrate
recovery  between  75  -  125%  of  a  known  sample  spike
for half of the value of each specified item.
8. 12.3  Special Reagents
8. 12.3.1    Hydrochloric   Acid,   Ultra   Pure   —   Use
hydrochloric  acid  specified  for  ultra  low  metal  ion
content.
8. 12.3.2    2%   (v/v)   Hydrochloric   Acid   So lution —
Dilute 20 mL of ultra pure 12 M hydrochloric acid to 1
L  using  water  meeting  the  criteria  for  Type  E1  in
ASTM D5127.
8. 12.4  Sample Preparation
8. 12.4.1    In   a   clean   environment,   place    250   g   of
solvent in a PTFE dish. Slowly evaporate on a hot plate
avoiding  loss  of  sample  by  effervescence  or  spattering

METHANOLSEMI C31-0301 © SEMI 1978, 20013
until  approximately  1  mL  of  liquid  remains.  Take  up
liquid and all visible residue (from walls of dish) with 1
mL  ultra  pure,  12  M  hydrochloric  acid  and  continue
heating  until  approximately  0.5  mL  of  liquid  remains.
No  undissolved  particulate  matter  should  be  observed.
Otherwise repeat the addition of hydrochloric acid until
all     particulate     matter     is     dissolved.     Transfer
quantitatively  to  a  50  mL  volumetric  flask  using  2%
(v/v) hydrochloric acid and adjust liquid level to mark.
Prepare a reagent blank using the same reagents and in
the same manner as for the sample concentration.
8. 12.5  Analysis
8. 12.5.1  Using the prepared sample and  reagent blank,
analyze  group  I  elements  potassium  (K)  and  sodium
(Na)  by  atomic  absorption  spectroscopy  and  all  other
elements  by  plasma  emission  spectroscopy.  Apply,  if
necessary,   a   reagent   blank   correction   to   the   final
determined value of the sample.
NOTE 3: Due  to  the  uncertainty  of  acid  concentration  in  the
liquid  residue  the  final  concentration  can  be  estimated  to  be
approximately 2% (v/v). Standard calibration solutions are to
use this same acid concentration.

time,  warm  gently  (avoid  boiling).  Filter  and  wash  the
precipitate  on  the  filter  with  several  portions  of  quite
dilute ammonium hydroxide (1 + 9). Discard the filtrate
and washings. Dissolve the precipitate on the filter with
50 mL nitric acid (1 + 3) added in small portions. Catch
the  filtrate  in  a  250  mL  glass-stoppered  conical  flask.
Add 13 mL of ammonium hydroxide (28-32% NH
3
) to
the flask while swirling and continue agitation until any
precipitate  redissolves.  Warm  the  solution  to  40°C  and
add 50 mL of ammonium molybdate-nitric acid reagent
solution.  Shake  vigorously  for  5  minutes  and  allow  to
stand  at  40°C  for  2  hours.  The  precipitate,  if  any,  for
the  sample  should  be  no  greater  than  that  for  the
standard.

8. 7  Arsenic and Antimony (as As)  —  Evaporate  20  mL
(20 g) of sample in a 150 mL beaker to a small volume
on a hot plate. Cool, add carefully 15 mL of nitric acid
and 5 mL of sulfuric acid, and evaporate to dense fumes
of  sulfur  trioxide.  Add  10  mL  of  nitric  acid  and  again
evaporate  to  dense  fumes.  If  carbon  is  still  present,
cool,   add   1   mL   of   30%   hydrogen   peroxide,   and
evaporate to dense fumes of sulfur trioxide. Repeat this
step  with  hydrogen  peroxide  addition  until  carbon  has
been  removed  completely.  Cool,  and  cautiously  wash
the colorless residue into a generator flask with water to
make  a  volume  of  35  mL.  Proceed  as  described  in  the
General  Method  for  Arsenic  (and  Antimony)  under
SEMI C1, Section 3.4.5, starting with the sentence that
begins  “Swirl  the  flask...”.  Any  red  color  in  the  silver
diethyldithiocarbamate solution of the sample should be
no greater than that of the standard containing 0.002 mg
of arsenic (As).

MIXED ACID ETCHANTSSEMI C34-0699 © SEMI 1981, 19991
SEMI C34-0699
SPECIFICATION AND GUIDELINE FOR MIXED ACID ETCHANTS
This specification and this guideline were technically approved by the Global Process Chemicals Committee
and  are  the  direct  responsibility  of  the  North  American  Process  Chemicals  Committee.    Current  edition
approved  by  the  North  American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  April  23,  1999.    Initially  available  on
SEMI OnLine May 1999; to be published June 1999.  This document replaces SEMI C2.1 and C7.19 in their
entirety.  Originally published in 1981 and 1995 respectively.
1  Purpose
1. 1   The  purpose  of  this  document   is  to  standardize
requirements   for   mixed   acid   etchants   used   in   the
semiconductor   industry   and   testing   procedures   to
support those standards. Test methods have been shown
to  give  statistically  valid  results.  This  document  also
provides  guidelines  for  grades  of  mixed  acid  etchants
for which a need has been identified. In the case of the
guidelines,   the   test   methods   may   not   have   been
statistically validated yet.
2  Scope
2. 1  The scope of this document is  all grades of mixed
acid etchants used in the semiconductor industry.
3  Limitations
3. 1  None.

5  Terminology
mixed   acid   etchant   —   any   combination   of   nitric,
hydrofluoric,    and    acetic    acids    with    the    relative
composition  expressed  in  terms  of  volumes  of  70%
nitric  acid,  49%  hydrofluoric  acid,  and  glacial  acetic
acid,  respectively.  In  the  expression,  all  the  relative
volumes  shall  be  reduced  to  a  ratio  of  the  smallest
whole   numbers.   For   example,   a   3:1:2   mixed   acid
etchant  would  imply  a  mixture  of  3  volumes  of  70%
nitric  acid,  1  volume  of  49%  hydrofluoric  acid,  and  2
volumes of glacial acetic acid. If a component is absent,
its relative volume shall be taken as zero. For example,
a  3:1:0  mixed  acid  etchant  would  imply  that  no  acetic
acid is present.
6  Composition
6. 1  The content of each of the com ponents of a mixed
acid etchant shall be expressed on a weight/weight basis
of the 100% acids in the total mixture. For the volume-
to-weight  conversion,  the  densities  shall  be  taken  as
1. 415, 1.153 g/mL, and 1.050 g/mL for 70% nitric acid,
49%    hydrofluoric    acid,    and    glacial    acetic    acid,
respectively.
7  Tolerances
Nitric Acid:± 1.0% (±  0.16 meq/g)
Hydrofluoric Acid:±  0.5% (±  0.25 meq/g)
Acetic Acid:±  1.0% (±  0.17 meq/g)

Sample Solution A: Add 3 mL (5 g) of sample to 2 mL of water,
dilute to 50 mL with brucine sulfate reagent
solution and mix.
Control Solution B: Add 3 mL (5 g) of sample to 0.025 mg of nitrate
ion (NO
3
).  Dilute to 50 mL with brucine sulfate
reagent solution, and mix.
Blank Solution C: Use 50 mL of the brucine sulfate reagent
solution.

8. 3.1  Heat  the  three  solutions  in  a  preheated  (boiling  water)  bath  for  10  minutes.    Cool  rapidly  in  an  ice  bath  to
room  temperature.    Set  a  spectrophotometer  at  410  nm  and,  using  1  cm  cells,  adjust  the  instrument  to  read  zero
absorbance with Blank Solution C in the light path.  Then determine the absorbance of Sample Solution A.  Adjust
the  instrument  to  read  zero  absorbance  with  Sample  Solution  A  in  the  light  path  and  determine  the  absorbance  of

8. 4  Sulfate
8. 4.1  The following inductively coupled plasma (ICP) method has given satisfactory results for the determination of
sulfate (SO
4
) by the analysis of sulfur (S) and subsequent calculation to determine the stoichiometric equivalent of
sulfate.
NOTE 2:  While  this  method  has  been  shown  to  accurately  determine  sulfate  concentration  in  phosphoric  acid,  the  ICP
methodology actually evaluates sulfur.  Therefore, other sulfur species (organic, etc.) will also be determined by this method, and
the “calculated” sulfate value may be higher than the actual sulfate concentration in a given sample.
8. 4.2  Special Reagents
8. 4.2.1  Water  —  The  water  used  for  all  dilution,  calibration  and  standards  should  meet  at  a  minimum,  the  criteria

have a scandium concentration of 40 ppm.
8. 4.3  Sample Preparation
8. 4.3.1  Dilute  20  g  of  phosphoric  acid  to  100  mL  with  water.    (An  aliquot  of  the  concentrated  scandium  standard
solution  should  also  be  added  during  the  dilution  process  such  that  the  final  diluted  sample  will  have  a  scandium
concentration of 40 ppm.)

NOTE 3:  While  this  method  has  been  shown  to  accurately  determine  sulfate  concentration  in  phosphoric  acid,  the  ICP
methodology actually evaluates sulfur.  Therefore, other sulfur species (organic, etc.) will also be determined by this method, and
the “calculated” sulfate value may be higher than the actual sulfate concentration in a given sample.
