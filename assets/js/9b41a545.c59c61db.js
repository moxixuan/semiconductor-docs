Where  manual  handling  is  necessary,  the  design\nshould reduce extended reaching, lifting, pulling, and awkward postures. Simultaneous lifting and twisting should be\navoided.    Load,  unload,  and  lift  over  points  should  be  located  such  that  the  floor  to  hand  height  is  84\u2013107  cm\n(33\u201342 in.), optimal design target is 102 cm (40 in.).\nA2-1.3  Handles or cutouts should be designed to facilitate use of the power grip (e.g., similar to that used to hold a\npistol).  Avoid  handles  that  require  pinch  grips  or  awkward  postures.    Handles  should  allow  carrying  close  to  the\nbody.\nA2-1.4  Lifting  and  handling  tasks  performed  in  a  stooping  position  should  be  avoided.  Stooping  occurs  when  the\nvertical material handling height is less than 84 cm (33 in.), or the horizontal reach distance is greater than 46 cm\n(18 in.) in front of body.\nA2-1.5  For two handed push/pull activities the floor to hand height should be between 97 cm (38 in.) and 112 cm\n(44 in.).\nA2-1.6  Consideration should be given to the standing surface to minimize the risk of slips and falls.\nA2-1.7  Awkward   postures   should   be   avoided.   Refer   to   Related   Information   1,   Table   R1-2   for   a   list   of\nrecommended ranges of awkward postures to avoid.\nA2-1.8  For a 2-person handling task, there should be adequate coupling locations and adequate body clearance for\nthe  activity.  Analyses  need  to  be  performed  and  documented  for  each  person  lifting  if  any  of  the  parameters\n(e.g., horizontal reach) are different.\nA2-2  Selecting and Using the Appropriate MMH Analysis Tool(s)\nA2-2.1  Three  general  MMH  evaluation  tools  are  identified  in  the  following  matrix.    The  three  tools  are  the\n\u201cApplication  manual  for  the  Revised  NIOSH  Lifting  Equation\u201d  lifting  equation,  biomechanical  models,  and\npsychophysical  capacity  tabular  data.    Table  A2-1  was  designed  to  assist  in  determining  which  analysis  tools  are\nappropriate for a particular task. For each unique characteristic of the task, a checkmark in the analysis tool column\nindicates that the analysis tool is appropriate. If there is any aspect of the task that does not show a check mark in a\nparticular  tools  column,  that  analysis  tool  is  not  appropriate  to  evaluate  the  task.  Note  that  in  many  situations\nmultiple tools are appropriate. In situations where the 1991 NIOSH equation is appropriate, the assessor should use\nit, because it typically will provide the most conservative results.  In other situations, the assessor may use any of the\nappropriate tools.\nA2-2.2  Correct application of the 1991 NIOSH equation is described in Waters, Thomas, et. al., Application manual\nfor  the  Revised  NIOSH  Lifting  Equation,  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (NIOSH),  Cincinnati,\nOH, 1994.\nA2-2.3  There are many sources of psychophysical data. One such source is A. Mital, A.S. Nicholson, M.M.

A  neutral  posture  is  the  body\nposition  that  minimizes  stresses  on  the  joints  and  is  the  posture  where  a  person  has  the  greatest  strength  potential.\nThe  neutral  posture  for  each  joint  is  near  the  middle  of  its  range  of  motion.    Generally,  the  body  in  its  neutral\nposition is standing erect with the eyes looking forward, and the arms hanging by the sides, as defined by \xb65.2.25.\nR1-2.2  Neutral  postures  are  shown  for  standing  and  seated  tasks  in  Table  R1-2.    The  joint  angles  of  these  neutral\npostures  are  used  as  the  origin  when  measuring  angular  deviations  of  body  part(s)  to  determine  if  a  posture  is\nawkward.\nR1-2.3  When  the  body  is  in  a  non-neutral  posture,  potential  strength  and  efficiency  decrease.    Table  R1-3  depicts\nselected  awkward  postures.  Angular  deviations  of  the  body  part(s)  from  a  neutral  posture  are  shown  for  the\nappropriate joint(s).\nR1-2.4  It is not always practicable to design equipment and tasks so that personnel remain in neutral postures.  The\nintent of these tables is to show the neutral postures for reference and the awkward postures that, according to the\nnormative portions of this document (e.g., \xb66.1.1 and \xb6A2-1.2) should be avoided.\nTable R1-2    Neutral Postures for Standing and Seated Tasks\nPosture  Image\nStanding Task"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"Arms loosely at the sides with the shoulders relaxed\nForearms parallel
