SEMI F1-96 © SEMI 1990, 19961 SEMI F1-96SPECIFICATION FOR LEAK INTEGRITY OF HIGH-PURITY GAS PIPINGSYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS NOTE: This entire document was revised in 1995.1 PurposeThis specification defines the leak testing requirementsand leakage rates for high-purity gas piping systemsand components used in semiconductor manufacturing.It is also intended as an aid in the procurement andinstallation of equipment, materials, and services. 2 Scope2.1 This specification applies to hi gh-purity gas pipingsystems and components used in semiconductormanufacturing facilities and comparable research anddevelopment areas.2.2 It includes testing methods for complete systems,subsystems, and individual components.2.3 It states requirements for both the user andmanufacturer and establishes leak rate limits foracceptance testing and qualification testing. 3 Limitations3.1 This specification is not a repl acement for safetyregulations. It is the responsibility of the user to ensurethat piping systems and components comply with allapplicable safety regulations.3.2 Interferences3.2.1 Mass spectrometer leak testing with helium canresult in misleading indications due to highpermeability of polymeric materials by helium.Permeation is often indicated by a delayed leakageindication and a continually rising apparent leakagerate. Helium tracer gas under pressure is absorbed bypermeable materials, and subsequent desorption caninhibit later testing at sensitive levels. Therefore,perform the tests in this order: inboard, internal, andoutboard.3.2.2 For low pressure tests, 1 MPa (147 psig) or less,the space to be filled with tracer gas must be purged orevacuated to avoid dilution. This applies both toenclosures and to the interiors of test objects.3.2.3 Long tubing lines or small diam eter tubing at aninlet may require purging to ensure that the tracer gasreaches the test object.3.2.4 Conductance between the test object and the leakdetector must be adequate to ensure test sensitivity.Restrictions such as regulators or check valves between the test object and the leak detector may require testingthe test object before installing the downstreamcomponents.3.2.5 Air flow can severely hinder c apture of leakinggas by a detector probe. If possible, such air flowshould be reduced to a minimum during testing. Iftesting must be performed in an area with substantial airflow, a protective film, such as is described in ASTM E499, Method B, should be placed around the probe tipwhen examining each joint.3.2.6 Temperature variations may af fect leakperformance. However, this specification does notaddress this effect. 4 Referenced DocumentsAll documents cited shall be the latest publishedrevisions. 4.1 SEMI DocumentSEMI S2  Safety Guidelines for SemiconductorManufacturing Equipment 4.2 ASTM Standards1E 493  Standard Test Methods for Leaks Using theMass Spectrometer Leak Detector in the Inside-OutTesting ModeE 498  Standard Methods of Testing for Leaks Usingthe Mass Spectrometer Leak Detector or Residual GasAnalyzer in the Tracer Probe ModeE 499  Standard Methods of Testing Leaks Using theMass Spectrometer Leak Detector in the Detector ProbeMode 5 Terminology5.1 acceptance test  A test cond ucted on eachcomponent, subsystem, or system produced. It is thebasis for acceptance or rejection by the purchaser. Thepurpose of acceptance testing is to provide a check toensure that the component, subsystem, or system hasbeen properly assembled or manufactured.5.2 component  An individual p iece or a completeassembly of individual pieces capable of being joined 1 American Society for Testing and Materials, 100 Barr HarborDrive, West Conshohoken, PA 19428-2959

SEMI F1-96 © SEMI 1990, 1996 2 with other pieces or components. The typicalcomponents referred to by this specification are valves,fittings, regulators, pressure gauges, pressure and flowsensors, and tubing welded to fittings.5.3 design pressure  Of a system or subsystem, thepressure at the most severe condition of internal andexternal pressure expected during normal service. Themaximum pressure expected in any portion of a systemor subsystem is typically determined by the maximumadjustable setting of the last pressure regulator thatsupplies it, the supply pressure to the regulator, or theactuation pressure of any relief device incorporated.5.4 high-purity  Of a system, su bsystem, orcomponent used for the control of chemicals (gases orliquids), designed and constructed in such a manner thatit does not introduce significant impurities, particulateor molecular, into the flow stream it controls orregulates.NOTE: Such systems, subsystems, or components aredesigned and constructed such that, if an impurity isintroduced into the flow path, it can be readily purged to aninsignificant level. 5.5 leak  A path (or paths) in a s ealed system thatwill pass tracer gas when a pressure differential ordiffusion path exists. There are two leak mechanisms: amechanical passage and a material through which gascan diffuse or permeate. A leak may have bothmechanisms operating in parallel.5.6 leakage, inboard  Leakage f rom outside toinside occurring when the internal pressure is less thanthe external pressure acting on a component. Inboardleakage is typically determined by introducing a tracergas around the exterior of the piping system orcomponent under test.NOTE: Inboard leak tests are easier tests to conduct to highsensitivity levels, but are typically not indicative ofpressurized operating conditions. It is difficult to correlate aninboard leak test to the performance of a component,subsystem, or system when under internal pressure. Also, theinternal collapsing forces created by external pressure maymask leaks which may exist under pressurized operatingconditions. 5.7 leakage, internal  Leakage o ccurring within acomponent across a flow barrier, such as the seat of aclosed valve.5.8 leakage, outboard  Leakage from inside tooutside occurring when the internal pressure is greaterthan the external pressure acting on a component.Outboard leakage is typically determined byintroducing a tracer gas into the interior of the pipingsystem or component under test. 5.9 may  A term indicating that a provision isneither required nor prohibited by this specification.5.10 measured leak rate  The rate of leakage of agiven component, subsystem, or system measuredunder specific conditions and employing a tracer gas.NOTE: When testing with high-pressure 100% helium on amass spectrometer leak detector, measured leak rates must beconverted to equivalent standard leak rates. 5.11 qualification test  A test con ducted on samplesof production articles manufactured to a single designto establish the performance rating of a product. Thetests are extensive and closely controlled andcompletely analyze the characteristics of a componentfor use in a high-purity installation.5.12 rated pressure  The manufac turersrecommended maximum allowable operating pressureat the manufacturers rated temperature.5.13 shall  A term indicating that a provision is arequirement of this specification.5.14 should  A term indicating th at a provision isrecommended as good practice but is not a requirementof this specification.5.15 shutoff valve  A valve design ed for, andcapable of, positive closure to prevent flow within asystem. Typical shutoff valves include manuallyactuated, power-actuated, or spring-actuated, fail-safeshutoff valves. Generally excluded are self-actuatedvalves such as check valves, pressure regulators, flowcontrollers, and other devices not intended to providepositive shutoff.5.16 standard leak rate  The flow of helium at21.1°C (70°F) and 101.3 kPa (1 atm) through a leakwhen the partial pressure of helium on the high side is101.3 kPa and the partial pressure on the low side isbelow 133 Pa (1 torr).NOTE: Express leak rates in kiloPascal-liters per second(kPa-L/sec). Calculate the standard leak rate of helium fromthe measured leak rate by multiplying by the ratio of 101.3kPa to the partial pressure of helium, as follows: Standard = 101.3 kPa(1 atm) measured leak rateactual He partial pressure  5.17 subsystem  An assembly of t wo or morecomponents manufactured as a single entity. Asubsystem must be combined with one or moreadditional components or subsystems to form acomplete system. The typical subsystems referred to bythis specification are gas source manifolds, gasdistribution manifolds, and gas control manifoldswithin the process equipment.

The internal leakage specifications apply only if the test object is rated for positive closure.b. The internal leakage specification applies to each positive closure. If positive shutoff devices are in parallel, the specification appliesto the parallel devices as a group.c. When piping systems or components employ polymeric seals, the internal and outboard leak rates specified above shall be modified bymultiplying the stated values by 100.d. When new construction projects preclude measurement of outboard leakage at the leak rates specified above, the outboard leakagelimits shall be modified by multiplying the stated values by 100.8 Test Methods8.1 Dangers8.1.1 Testing of systems, subsystem s, or components with high pressure gas could cause explosive rupture of theseitems, with the resulting fragmentation causing death or serious injury. In addition, if a component of the systemunder test were to fail, an unrestricted supply of tracer gas could cause pressurization and rupture of the testenclosure. Such testing shall not be performed without shielding that will protect the operator and other personnel inthe event of equipment failure. The source of tracer gas should be provided with a suitable device that will limit orshut off the flow in the event of component rupture.8.1.2 Some elements of a piping sys tem may not be designed for pressurization. Pressurization of such systemelements could cause explosive rupture, with the resulting fragmentation causing death or serious injury. Suchelements shall not be tested in a manner inconsistent with the manufacturers specifications. Valves used to isolatethese elements of systems must be rated for higher pressure than the proposed test pressure.8.1.3 Some components may be des igned for closure only in one direction or only under pressure or vacuum.Testing of such components in a manner other than that for which they are designed could cause explosive rupture,with the resulting fragmentation causing death or serious injury. Such components shall not be tested in a mannerinconsistent with the manufacturers specifications.8.2 Tracer Gas  (Unless otherw ise specified in Sections 8.4 through 8.6.)8.2.1 For those tests in which the tes t object is enclosed in or sprayed with tracer gas, 100% helium.8.2.2 For those tests in which the tes t object is pressurized with tracer gas, 101.3 kPa (1 atm) of helium plusnitrogen to pressurize to the design pressure.8.2.3 The use of helium with a purit y level of less than 100 ppb total contaminants and filtered at point of use toless than 0.1 m is required.8.2.4 Inboard tests are performed at one atmosphere.8.2.5 Internal and outboard tests are performed at the design pressure.8.3 The use of a dry, oil-free heliu m mass spectrometer leak detector is recommended to prevent hydrocarboncontamination of the piping system or component during inboard and internal leak testing.
