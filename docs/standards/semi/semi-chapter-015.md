SEMI E92-0302E © SEMI 1999, 200311 APPENDIX 1APPLICATION NOTES NOTE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI E92 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures onDecember 3, 1999 by the Japanese Regional Standards Committee.A1-1 NOTICE: Usage of Loader Locating PinsA1-1.1 In order to provide quick interchangeabilitywith accurate repeatability, it is recommended to use Vshaped groove to couple with the positioning pin anduse flat plane to couple with the anti-rotation pin asshown in Figure 4.A1-2 NOTICE: BOLTS/Light ShelfA1-2.1 BOLTS/Light Shelf may be used in order tokeep compatibility with BOLTS/M interface. In thiscase, BOLTS/M interface provides backward compati-bility of equipment interface and BOLTS/Light inter-face provides standardized precise quick attachment/detachment interface. BOLTS/Light shelf is shown inFigure A-1.A1-3 NOTICE: Box Opener/Loader Compati-bilityA1-3.1 It is recommended that equipment suppliersdesign their process equipment to be capable ofaccepting box opener/loaders that interface with either aBOLTS/M interface or a BOLTS/Light interface. Thisstandard has been structured to make the BOLTS/Lightinterface a component capable of being attached to aBOLTS/M interface. (It is not physically feasible tomake the BOLTS/M interface an optional componentcapable of being attached to a BOLTS/Light interface).A1-3.2 If an equipment supplier provides a BOLTS/Minterface, their process equipment can be modularlyconfigured to interface with either type of box/openerloader. This type of approach allows two-waycompatibility:  Process equipment with a BOLTS/M interface canattach a BOLTS/Light interface. This enables theprocess equipment to now accept a boxopener/loader with a BOLTS/Light interface. Process equipment with a BOLTS/Light interfacecan remove the BOLTS/Light interface to expose aBOLTS/M interface. This enables the processequipment to now accept a box opener/loader witha BOLTS/M interface.Equipment suppliers may provide only a BOLTS/Lightinterface at their discretion. However, it should beunderstood that process equipment designed in thismanner can not be modularly configured to accept abox/opener loader with a BOLTS/M interface. A1-4 NOTICE: Docking Stroke Variation forBackward CompatibilityA1-4.1 In order to provide the Backward compatibil-ity requested in I300I/J300 GJG1, vendors who want touse this standard to put BOLTS/Light unit in their exist-ing BOLTS/M compliant loadport unit may vary dock-ing stroke as their option to accommodate their existingdesigns. The unit that has a different docking stroke isno more a BOLTS/Light-Full-Compliant unit, but couldbe called as BOLTS/Light-Quasi-Compatible unit.A1-5 NOTICE: Sliding MechanismA1-5.1 Actual design of the sliding mechanism is leftto the box opener/loader and/or equipment designer.The equipment provides bottom interface planes as theloading slider areas.A1-5.1.1 This implies several types of bottom interfaceplanes are acceptable by the equipment; e.g., rollerguided, plastic material based, etc.A1-6 NOTICE: Maintenance CartA1-6.1 If the box opener/loader is too heavy toattach/detach manually by maintainer, this standardprovides for the possibility/capability of cart-basedmaintenance.A1-6.2 The cart may use the same cart to equipmentdocking mechanism as the cart for FOUP delivery.A1-6.3 The maintenance cart may also use aconnection with the bottom interface planes that aredefined in this standard. Specification of how to makethe carts is outside the scope of this standard.A1-7 NOTICE: Finger Pinch SensorA1-7.1 This document does not define or specify a fin-ger pinch sensor. Considering finger pinching withedges, the following approach may be recommended.  Finger pinching with edges is more serious than itis with flat surfaces. So, it is recommended not toplace the box flange seal in a narrow tunnelstructure which have sharp edges but place it on aflat surface (or in a dimple that has chamferededges). 1 I300I/J300 GJG  I300I/J300 Global Joint Guidance for 300 mmSemiconductor Factories.

SEMI E92-0302E © SEMI 1999, 200313  Placement of a finger pinch sensor in theapproximately 11 mm space behind SEMI E15.1D1 is recommended.A1-8 NOTICE: Adjustment of BOLTS/Light UnitA1-8.1 In order to maintain quick interchangeabilityand interoperability and quick attachment/detachment,adjustment capability should be provided separately bythe box opener/loader and equipment to ensure the portis positioned correctly with respect to the waferhandling robot.A1-8.2 As a result, adjustment means will be necessaryon both the box opener/loader and the equipment. Thebox opener/loader may have a capability to calibrate itscritical dimensions in advance, for example, theparallelism between bottom interface surface and HDP.In this case, it is not necessary to adjust the boxopener/loader after installation. The equipment shouldhave a capability to adjust bottom interface plane withrespect to the wafer-handling robot. In case of changingthe box opener/loader in the field, adjustment mightthen not be necessary on both the box opener/loaderand the equipment side.A1-8.3 A fixture may help facilitate this adjustment.A1-8.4 If fine adjustment is needed after reattachingthe box opener/loader (due to deficient adjustment ofthe box opener/loader or equipment side), it may bedone on the equipment side by means of adjustingscrews or other mechanism at bottom interface plane.A1-9 NOTICE: Control Connection AreaA1-9.1 Connection should be completed after slidingin the box opener/loader. Disconnection should becompleted before sliding out the box opener/loader.

SEMI E99-1104E © SEMI 2000, 20043 6.1.2 Transition tables are provided in conjunction with the state diagrams to explicitly describe the nature of eachstate transition. A transition table contains columns for Transition number, Previous State, Trigger, New State,Actions, and Comments. The trigger (column 3) for the transition occurs while in the previous state. Theactions (column 5) includes a combination of: Actions taken upon exit of the previous state. Actions taken upon entry of the new state. Actions taken which are most closely associated with the transition.6.1.2.1 No differentiation is made between these cases.6.2 Object Notation6.2.1 The object models in Related Information 2 use the Object Modeling Technique (OMT) developed byRumbaugh, James, et al, in Object-Oriented Modeling and Design.2 An overview of this notation is provided inSEMI E39, Object Services Standard: Concepts, Behavior, and Services. Num Previous State Trigger New State Actions Comments 6.3 Service Message Representation6.3.1 Services are functions or methods that may be provided by either the equipment or the host. A servicemessage may be either a request message, which always requires a response, or a notification message, that does notrequire a response.6.3.2 Service Definition6.3.2.1 A service definition table defines the specific set of messages for a given service resource, as shown in thefollowing table: Message Service Name Type Description Type can be either N = Notification or R = Request & Response. 6.3.2.2 Notification type messages are initiated by the service provider (e.g., the equipment) and the provider doesnot expect to get a response from the service user. Request messages are initiated by a service user (e.g., the host).Request messages ask for data or an activity from the provider. Request messages expect a specific responsemessage (no presumption on the message content).6.3.3 Service Parameter Dictionary6.3.3.1 A service parameter dictionary table defines the description, format and its possible value for parametersused by services, as shown in the following table: Parameter Name Description Format: Possible Value 6.3.3.2 A row is provided in the table for each parameter of a service. 2 James Rumbaugh, Michael Blaha, William Premerlani, Frederick Eddy, William Lorensen, Object-Oriented Modeling and Design, EnglewoodCliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1991.

SEMI E99-1104E © SEMI 2000, 2004 4 6.3.4 Service Message Definition6.3.4.1 A service message definition table defines the parameters used in a service, as shown in the following table: Parameter Req/Ind Rsp/Cnf Comment 6.3.4.2 The columns labeled REQ/IND and RSP/CNF link the parameters to the direction of the message. Themessage sent by the initiator is called the Request. The receiver terms this message the Indication or the request.The receiver may then send a Response which the original sender terms the Confirmation.6.3.4.3 The following codes appear in the REQ/IND and RSP/CNF columns and are used in the definition of theparameters (e.g., how each parameter is used in each direction): Code DescriptionM Mandatory Parameter  Must be given a valid value.C Conditional Parameter  May be defined in some circumstances and undefined in others. Whether a valueis given may be completely optional or may depend on the value of the other parameter.U User-Defined Parameter.- The parameter is not used.= (For response only.) Indicates that the value of this parameter in the response must match that in the primary(if defined). 7 Overview7.1 The Carrier ID Reader/Writer Model defines the behavior and services (functions) for both Carrier ID Readersand Carrier ID Reader/Writers. The Carrier ID Reader/Writer is a small intelligent system, typically used as asubsystem within equipment.7.1.1 The primary functionality of the Carrier ID Reader/Writer is to read the identifier of the carrier (Carrier ID)from the Carrier ID tag. Various technologies may be used to encode the Carrier ID and to read it. Sometechnologies do not allow data to be written.7.1.2 The acronym CIDRW is used to refer to both the Carrier ID Reader and the Carrier ID Reader/Writer. Therequirements for the Carrier ID Reader are a subset of the requirements for the Carrier ID Reader/Writer.7.1.3 An object model for the CIDRW is provided in Related Information 2  Object Model.7.2 Number of Heads7.2.1 A Reader/Writer Head is a device that is positioned on a load port for reading or reading/writing informationfrom a Carrier ID tag. A Carrier ID Reader/Writer provides one or more ID Reader/Writer Heads and is connectedto an upstream controller by a single interface. This allows the upstream controller to control either one head ormultiple heads using the same interface specification.7.2.2 Single Head Configuration7.2.2.1 In the case of a single head, the head may be presented as an integrated part of the CIDRW.7.2.3 Multiple Head Configuration7.2.3.1 In the case of multiple heads, some services are logically performed by the CIDRW, and the individualheads logically perform others. The individual heads are numbered sequentially and may be referenced individuallyby the upstream controller. Note that the upstream controller does not communicate directly with the heads. Allcommunications are between the upstream controller and the CIDRW unit.7.2.3.2 In the multi-head case, the CIDRW shall allow independent control of the heads. Multiple transactionsinvoking services performed by the individual heads may be open at the same time. For example, when a readcommand is sent to one head, the host can send additional commands such as a read command and a statusconfirmation command to another head before the first head sends the response to the first command.

SEMI E99-1104E © SEMI 2000, 20045 7.3 Upstream Controller7.3.1 The CIDRW provides certain services when requested by the upstream controller. The upstream controllersends a message requesting the specified service, and the CIDRW sends a message with the response.7.3.2 This standard assumes that an upstream controller initiates each service message to the CIDRW, and theCIDRW sends its response to the upstream controller. The upstream controller must watch the response time tomonitor the communication timeout. This standard will define the recommended method for handling exceptionscaused by timeouts.7.3.3 In addition, some CIDRW may provide asynchronous notification to the upstream controller. Examples of thisinclude, but are not limited to, the detection of a fault condition resulting in an alarm. Asynchronous notification isnot required for compliance to this standard. 8 Attributes8.1 An attribute is an item of information about an entity that is maintained and is available by request. There iscertain information concerning the CIDRW that is of potential interest to the upstream controller, including themanufacturer, the model, and the serial number of the device. This information is considered as attributes of theCIDRW and is available on request.8.2 CIDRW Attribute Definition Table8.2.1 Table 1 defines the attributes of the Carrier ID Reader/Writer subsystem.Table 1 CIDRW Attribute Definitions Attribute Name Description Access Reqd FormFundamentalConfiguration Number of heads.

IDLE and BUSY correspond to substates of the same names in the CIDRW state model. If anyhead is NOT OPERATING, then the active substate of ALARM STATUS in the CIDRW state model is ALARMS.9.3.3 The NOT OPERATING state is not required, if it is not possible to detect alarms related to the head. Notealso that some alarm conditions are fatal (so that the head cannot operate with full functionality) while others maynot be fatal.

A maintenance condition exists when the CIDRW determines the need for eithermaintenance (repair) or preventive maintenance activities.10.2 The CIDRW is able to detect and report alarm conditions through its status attributes (when queried by theupstream controller). It may additionally report changes in alarm conditions asynchronously through alarm or eventreports.

This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot onJanuary 10, 2003. R4-1 Application of RF Tag as Carrier ID TagR4-1.1 In case that RF Tag is utilized as Carrier Tag for SEMI E99 application, to secure the interoperability amongthe CIDRW units for writing / reading the Carrier ID into / out of the RF Tag, some basic consideration should betaken as follows:R4-1.1.1 Coincidence of Carrier ID Written and Read in Tag Memory  Fundamentally Carrier ID, which is readout, should be quite same as written, with no addition.R4-1.1.2 Caution for Carrier ID Contents Applied to Object ID  Carrier ID as Material ID can be used as ObjectID. But the Space Character (20 16) should not be used as the first or the last character of Carrier ID. SEMI E39restricts these.R4-1.1.3 Non-Visible Character in Carrier ID  If non-visible ASCII character is found within the specified tagarea, CIDRW shall send out an error (i.e. Execution error) to the upstream controller when Read ID service wasexecuted. The contents of Carrier ID issued by host/upstream controller should be compliant with visible Character.R4-1.1.4 Location of Carrier ID Field (CID Field)  Carrier ID field shall be located from the first byte to themaximum byte of Carrier ID in the memory of the Electric Tag.

The bilateralreference plane is coplanar with the bilateral datumplane defined in SEMI E57.4.1.2 facial reference plane  a vertical plane whichbisects the reticle and is parallel to the front side of thepod (where reticles are removed or inserted). The facialreference plane passes through the center of the200 mm SMIF as defined in SEMI E19.4. The facialreference plane is coplanar with the facial datum planedefined in SEMI E57.4.1.3 horizontal reference plane  a horizontal planecoplanar with the top surface of the port door as definedin SEMI E19.4. The horizontal reference plane iscoplanar with the horizontal datum plane defined inSEMI E57.4.1.4 minienvironment  a localized environmentcreated by an enclosure to isolate the product fromcontamination and people.4.1.5 nominal reticle center line  the line that isdefined by the intersection of the two vertical referenceplanes (facial and bilateral) and passes through thenominal center of the seated reticle (which must behorizontal when the carrier is placed on the SMIF asdefined in SEMI E19.4).4.1.6 pellicle  as defined in SEMI P5.4.1.7 reticle  as defined in SEMI E30.1.4.1.8 Reticle SMIF Pod (RSP)  a minienvironmentcompatible carrier capable of holding one 6 inch or one230 mm reticle in a horizontal orientation duringtransport and storage and is compatible with a StandardMechanical Interface (SMIF) per SEMI E19.4.4.1.9 robotic handling flanges  horizontalprojections on the top of the box for lifting and rotatingthe box (as defined in SEMI E47.1).4.1.10 side handling flanges  horizontal projectionson the sides of the pod (sides parallel to the bilateralreference plane) for manual or automated lifting,transportation or positioning of the pod. 5 Ordering Information5.1 Intended Use  This standard is intended tospecify reticle carriers over a reasonable lifetime of use,not just those in new condition. For this reason, the purchaser needs to specify a time period and thenumber and type of uses to which the carriers will beput. It is under these conditions that the carriers mustremain in compliance with the requirements listed inSection 6.5.2 Reticle Size and Thickness  The purchaser needsto specify the reticle size and thickness to beaccommodated in the RSP.5.3 Optional Features  The purchaser needs tospecify whether optional components (identified inSection 2) are required.5.4 Temperature Ranges  The purchaser needs tospecify two sets of temperatures to which the RSPsmight be exposed. An operating temperature range isthe set of environmental temperatures in which theRSPs will remain in compliance with the requirementslisted in Section 6. A temporary temperature range isthe set of environmental temperatures to which the podscan be exposed such that when the RSPs return to theoperating temperature range, the RSPs will be incompliance with the requirements listed in Section 6.Limits on exposure times to elevated temperaturesshould be specified.5.5 Electrostatic Dissipation  The end user mayrequire a continuous path to ground from the reticle tothe carrier registration and handling features. Thepurchaser needs to specify whether electrostaticdissipation is required.5.6 Contamination Requirements  The purchaserneeds to specify their contamination requirements. 6 Requirements6.1 Symmetry  Most of the dimensions of the RSPare determined with respect to the three orthogonalreference planes defined in this document: the facialreference plane, the horizontal reference plane and thebilateral reference plane. All dimensions are symmetricabout the bilateral reference plane except the latchfeatures. All dimensions are symmetric about the facialreference plane except the registration features, carriersensing pads, info pads, and latch features.6.2 Door  The pod door, and its frame on the bottomof the pod, must be compatible with a port whichconforms to SEMI E19.4.6.3 Reticle Centering and Capture  When the carrieris closed, the reticle must be secured in all degrees offreedom within the carrier to prevent movement duringtransport and must be centered with respect to the SMIFdefined in SEMI E19.4. A bisecting plane through thereticle, parallel to the bilateral reference plane must bewithin x114 of the bilateral reference plane of the loadport when the reticle is seated in the carrier. A

&lt;!-- Page 40 --&gt;

SEMI E100-1104 © SEMI 2000, 20043 bisecting plane through the reticle, parallel to the facialreference plane must be within y133 of the facialreference plane of the load port when the reticle isseated in the carrier. When the carrier is open, it mustprovide a horizontal reticle capture range of x135 andy135. This capture range must be provided at z162above the horizontal reference plane.6.4 Exclusion Volumes  The interior of the RSP mustnever intrude into the pellicle exclusion volumes, andmust not intrude into the end-effector exclusionvolumes or safety rail exclusion volumes when thecarrier is open. Where the exclusion volumes overlap,the end-effector exclusion volume is reduced by thepellicle exclusion volume when handling pelliclized orchrome-down reticles.6.4.1 End-Effector Exclusion Volumes  Volumes inan opened pod which must be free for the end-effectorto enter and handle the reticle as defined by x116, x132,y136, x144, x146, y144, z159, and z160 for a 230 mmRSP, and by x118, x143, x145, y143, z159, and z160 fora 6 inch RSP. No obstructions should exist in the end-effector exclusion volume which extends in thedirection normal to the facial reference plane.6.4.2 Pellicle Exclusion Volumes  Volumes in thepod below the reticle which must remain free fromintrusion to accommodate the pellicle mounted on thereticle. No obstructions should exist in the pellicleexclusion volume which extends in the direction normalto the facial reference plane as defined by x115, z159and z161 for a 230 mm RSP, and by x119, z159 andz161 for a 6 inch RSP. No obstructions should exist inthe transverse pellicle exclusion volume which extendsin the direction normal to the bilateral reference planeas defined by y129, z159 and z163 for a 230 mm RSP,and by y130, z159 and z163 for a 6 inch RSP.NOTE 1: The transverse pellicle exclusion volume is onlyintended to specify where the reticle supports in the podcannot exist. Reticles with the pellicles transverse aretypically handled with end-effectors which grip from abovethe reticle.6.4.3 Safety Rail Exclusion Volumes  Volumes in anopened pod which must remain free from intrusion toaccommodate safety rails which may be used on end-effectors to protect the edge of the reticle duringhandling. No obstructions should exist in the safetyrail exclusion volumes which extend in the directionnormal to the facial reference plane as defined by x137and z167 for a 230 mm, and by x138 and z167 for a 6inch RSP.6.5 External Dimensions  Figures 1, 2 and 3 show,respectively, the external top view, a detail and thefront view of the RSP. Table 2 defines all of the external dimensions of the RSP (equivalent for both the6 inch and the 230 mm versions).6.6 Internal Dimensions  Figures 4 through 8 showinternal dimensions for the 6 inch and 230 mm versionsof the RSP. Table 2 defines all internal dimensionswhich are common to the 6 inch and 230 mm RSP.Table 3 defines the internal dimensions which applyonly to the 230 mm RSP. Table 4 defines the internaldimensions which apply only to the 6 inch RSP. Themaximum height of the features which support thereticle are given by z164 for a 230 mm RSP and z165for a 6 inch RSP.NOTE 2: The maximum height of the reticle supports, plusthe clearance between the reticle supports and reticle (chosenby the tool supplier) determine the height the reticle must belifted before being extracted from, or inserted into the RSP.6.7 Robotic Handling Flange  On the top of the podis an optional handling flange for automatedmanipulation of the RSP. Figures 1, 3, and 5 showdimensions for the robotic handling flange. Table 2defines the dimensions for the robotic handling flange.6.8 Side Handling Flanges  On the sides of the podparallel to the bilateral reference plane are optionalhandling flanges for automated manipulation of theRSP. Figures 1, 2, and 3 show dimensions for the sidehandling flanges. Table 2 defines the dimensions for theside handling flanges. No obstructions may exist in theside handling exclusion volumes which extend in thedirection normal to the facial reference plane as definedby x136 and z166 when the side handling flanges arepresent.6.9 Kinematic Coupling  The RSP door must havethe capability of registering on the kinematic pinsdefined in SEMI E57. The features that mate with thepins must provide a lead-in capability that corrects anRSP misalignment no greater than r19 in any horizontaldirection. However, it is recommended that robotsplacing RSPs on kinematic couplings use as little of thislead-in capability as possible to avoid wear.6.10 Carrier Sensing Pads  The RSP door must havecarrier sensing pads as defined in SEMI E1.9.6.11 Info Pads  When the RSP is placed on a port,the info pads A, B, C, and D communicate informationabout the RSP configuration. Figures 6 and 8 show thedimensions of the info pads. Table 2 defines the infopad dimensions. A pad in the up position must be z26above the horizontal reference plane. A pad in thedown position must be z2 above the horizontalreference plane. Info pad assignments are shown inTable 1. Info pads that are not defined can be ateither the up or down position unless specified by theend user. RSP configurations to be assigned may beassigned by the end user.

Allrequired convex features may also have a radius of upto r66 to prevent small contact patches with largestresses that might cause wear and particles. Note thatthese limits on the radius of all required features arespecified as a maximum (not a minimum) to ensure thatthe required features are not rounded off too much. Thelower bound on the radius is up to the carrier supplier.Note also that this radius applies to every requiredfeature unless another radius is called out specifically.Here a required feature is an area on the surface of thecarrier specified by a dimension (or intersections ofdimensions) that has a tolerance and not just amaximum or minimum (such as the edges of the robotichandling flange). 6.13 Carrier ID Exclusion Volume  Volume externalto the pod which must remain free from intrusion toaccommodate a carrier ID label or tag mounted on thepod. No obstructions should exist in the carrier IDexclusion volume as defined by x147, y137, y138, z180,and z181. Figures 1 and 3 show dimensions for thecarrier ID exclusion volume. Table 2 defines thedimensions for the carrier ID exclusion volume. If alabel is used, its surface must be at y139.6.14 Conveyor Rails  Optional surfaces on thebottom for transporting the RSP on roller conveyors.The conveyor rail surfaces are bounded by x140, x141,x142, y140, y141 and y142 as shown in Figure 9. Theheight of the conveyor rail surface is defined by z171.Table 2 defines the dimensions for the conveyor rails. 7 Related Documents7.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E15  Specification for Tool Load PortSEMI P1  Specification for Hard Surface PhotomaskSubstratesSEMI P33  Provisional Specification for Develop-mental 230 mm Square Hard Surface PhotomaskSubstratesSEMI S8  Safety Guidelines for ErgonomicsEngineering of Semiconductor ManufacturingEquipment

SEMI E100-1104 © SEMI 2000, 200413 APPENDIX 1APPLICATION NOTES NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI E100 and was approved by full letter ballotprocedures on September 3 and December 15, 1999 by the North American Regional Standards Committee, but therecommendations in this appendix are optional and are not required to conform to this standard.A1-1 Edge contact only with the photomask ispreferred when handling, transporting, or storing.A1-2 Skewness, warp, rock, and stiffness are implicitlydefined in the geometric tolerances.A1-3 A 6 inch reticle with a 140 mm wide pellicle canbe accommodated in the RSP, but may requireautomation which approaches from above the reticle.A1-4 Features on the RSP which enable stacking maybe required by end users. It is preferred that thesefeatures allowing stacking in only one orientation.A1-5 Features on the RSP which provide visualorientation of the RSP top and RSP door may berequired by end users.A1-6 In order to permit end-effectors, which canhandle both 230 mm and 6 inch reticles, it is recom-mended to include the 230 mm end-effector exclusionvolumes in RSPs configured for 6 inch reticles.
