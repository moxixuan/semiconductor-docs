These cells are to be placedphotolithographically or by other direct patterningmethods onto wafer substrates at different maskinglevels during the IC manufacturing process.2.1.2 Many details of the pattern cel ls, such as theorientation, magnitude, range of the linewidths, andpolarity of tone (clearfield vs. darkfield) will be definedby the user, unless otherwise noted. When reportingresults based on tests using these cells, details such asfield polarity, orientation, and topographicconsiderations must be indicated. 2.1.3 All critical dimensions given i n this documentare the actual CAD values at 1X. For a givenmagnification, M, the target dimensions on the reticleshould be exactly M times the dimension given in thisspecification. The reticle dimensions must not be sizedto compensate for any wafer process-induced bias.2.2 Applications2.2.1 These cells are intended to be used in severalapplications. The following applications list some of theintended uses for the pattern cells.2.2.1.1 in-line process monitoring  To establishpatterns to determine if the layer has been processed todesign specifications.2.2.1.2 process transfer  To standar dize the patternsfor process monitoring within manufacturingfabrication sites and to facilitate process and technologytransfers between sites.2.2.1.3 equipment evaluation  To st andardize thepatterns used to evaluate semiconductor equipment.2.2.1.4 equipment characterization  To standardizethe patterns for the characterization process of differentmetrology equipment. 3 Guidelines for Application s3.1 General3.1.1 The cells described here repres ent a primarymetrology set from which composite patterns may beconstructed.3.1.2 A composite pattern set meets this standard if itconsists of any number of the basic cells describedherein, provided all design rules for each cell areobeyed.3.1.3 Each basic cell contains a fund amental designfeature. This feature may be repeated at different (user-defined) dimensions within a modified metrology cell.The user will determine all appropriate dimensions forthe feature as they apply to specificprocessing/equipment situations.3.1.4 The figures provided within th is document areintended to illustrate the proper layout of each patterncell and to define the appropriate design elements usedwithin each basic cell. The pattern cell dimensions areprovided when appropriate.3.1.5 All feature groups must be sep arated by at leastfive times the largest feature width.

The units ofthe CD labels must be micrometers and at least twosignificant figures must be used. The labels must be ofa clearly printable size. Decimal points are optional. Ifdecimal points are eliminated, digits to the left of theimaginary decimal point must be slightly larger thanthose digits to the right. Characters to the left of thedecimal are optional. All CD labels that are printed withone size only will correspond to numbers less than 1.0m, and any number greater than 1.0 m must containat least one character to the right of the decimal place.If the cell includes a bias, a label to indicate this bias,including a + sign, must be placed near the basic cell.One significant figure may be used for bias labels if thebias is less than 1.0 m and a multiple of 0.1 m. (e.g.,+ 4 = + 0.4 m).3.1.8 It is recognized that there are d esign limitationsdictated by the equipment used to generate the pattern(e.g., CAD grids, PG rectangles, E-beam spot sizes). Itis permitted within this standard to modify these cells inorder to meet these equipment limitations (e.g., stay ongrid).3.2 Specific3.2.1 L-Bar Cell  (See Figure 4.)3.2.1.1 The L-bar cell is designed to b e a measurementsite for isolated features as well as line and spacegroups in orthogonal axes. The cell can be used tomeasure the quality of pattern transfer and metrology ofimaged features. The cell is also a qualitative visual testsite for resolution of straight lines and lines bent at rightangles.3.2.1.2 The design elements are the no minal featurewidth, the inter-feature spacing, the minimum featurelength, and the intergrouping linewidth difference(bias).3.2.1.3 The basic cell consists of one o r more groupsof nested L-shaped lines at a specific pitch. The pitch isdefined at twice the nominal feature width.

If thesecells are to be used for cross-section analysis, the lengthof the L-bars may be designed considerably longer thanthe minimum length. 3.2.1.4 The L-bar basic cell consists o f one, three,five, or seven feature groups. If the basic cell onlyconsists of a single feature group, then the lines andspaces must both be equal to the nominal feature width.If the basic cell consists of three, five, or seven groups,then the groups are nested. For the middle group, thelines and spaces must both be equal to the nominalfeature width. The feature widths in each successivefeature group nested outside the middle group areincrementally increased by the bias. The feature widthsin each successive feature group inside the middlegroup are incrementally decreased by the bias. Thepitch for all L-bar groups within a basic cell must beheld constant and equal to twice the nominal featurewidth.3.2.2 Straight-Line Cell  (See Fig ure 6.)3.2.2.1 The straight-line cell is a versi on of the L-barcell, modified for tilted SEM inspection by removingthe elbows."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 3 --",">"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI P19-92 \xa9 SEMI 1992, 1996 4 Figure 7The square area, shown above, is removed to createstraight-line cell. 3.2.2.2 To create the straight-line cell from the L-barcell, the area removed will be a square defined by twodiagonal corners referred to as A and B in Figure 7.Corner A is the outer edge of the outermost elbow.Corner B is a point inside the innermost elbow whosedistance to the nearest edge is five times that of thesmallest CD  or 5.0 m if the smallest CD is less than1.0 m. This square area must remain unpatterned.3.2.3 Proximity Dagger Cell  (See Figure 8.)3.2.3.1 The proximity dagger cell is d esigned toprovide information on the proximity effects of isolatedlines/spaces in relation to large area blocks. This celldesign allows clear and dark features to be measuredsimultaneously in one layout.3.2.3.2 The design elements within th e cell are thenominal feature linewidth, the nominal featurespacewidth, and the staircase stepwidth. The stepwidthis user-selected, but it is recommended to be at least25% of the nominal feature pitch (i.e., pitch equalsnominal linewidth plus nominal spacewidth).3.2.3.3 The cell consists of a nine-tier staircasereproduced symmetrically in both clear and darkfields.A full description of the clearfield staircase (i.e., largechrome islands) is given. The same descriptions applyfor the darkfield staircase except the polarities arereversed. Each tier is 10 microns tall. The full width ofthe cell is 40 microns and the full height is 180 microns.The first tier separates the nominal feature widthsymmetrically from the large chrome islands by anamount equal to the nominal width. Tiers 27 aresuccessively wider by the indicated bias. The 8th and9th tiers will be 5 and 10 times the nominal featurewidth respectively. 3.2.4 Contact Array Cell  (See Fig ure 9.)3.2.4.1 The contact array cell is desig ned to provideresolution and proximity-effect information over a widerange of contact sizes.3.2.4.2 The design elements are the no minal squarecontact dimension, the inter-contact dimension withinthe 5  5 and the 3  3 arrays. The latter dimensionwill be equal to the contact dimension.3.2.4.3 The contact array cell will con sist of threesubgroups: a 5  5 contact array, a 3  3 contact array,and an isolated contact. The 5  5 array will producethe maximal proximity (i.e., dense printing) for thecenter contact. The center contact in the 3  3 arraywill exhibit proximal printing effects different fromboth the isolated contact and the dense contact.3.2.5 Staggered Contact Array  (S ee Figure 10.)3.2.5.1 The staggered contact array ce ll is designed toimprove the probability of cross-sectioning smallcontacts for SEM metrology analysis.3.2.5.2 The design elements are the sq uare contactdimension, the column-to-column vertical offset  orstaggering  and the contact-to-contact spacing. Thecontact-to-contact spacing will be equal to the squarecontact dimension.3.2.5.3 The contacts are laid out using a minimum ofthree columns of contacts. The user-selected offsetbetween columns should allow the contacts to remainon grid.3.2.5.4 The lines (or spaces) shown on the left side ofFigure 10 are optional. They have been placed toprovide feature identification of pitch calibration. If thewidths are to be submicron, 5 lines (or spaces) insteadof 3 will be required.3.2.6 Linearity Cell  (See Figure 1 1.)3.2.6.1 The linearity cell is designed t o test (1) thelinearity of the measurement method, assuming thelithographical process is linear over all line sizes used,or (2) the linearity of the process, assuming that themetrological method is linear over all line sizes used.3.2.6.2 The design elements of this ce ll are thelinewidths, the interfeature spacing, and the minimumline lengths. Unlike the other cells, its elements are notadjusted to a nominal critical dimension, but rather arenumerically specified as constants for all applications.3.2.6.3 The cell consists of nine parall el lines, placedon a five-micron pitch. The linewidths are 1.2, 1.1, 1.0,0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 microns. The line lengthsare a minimum of ten microns.

The sizeactually achieved (resolved CD) on the circuit may bedifferent from this nominal value.3.3.1.2 Measurements of the resolved CD may not beaccurate because of the difficulty in determining theactual location of the edge in the optical or SEM imageprofile.3.3.1.3 Even if inaccurate, measureme nt of theresolved CD can be valuable for comparison purposes ifthe measurement method has adequate precision andsensitivity to detect the dimensional changes of interest.3.3.1.4 The traditional definition of re solution may notbe adequate (e.g., ability to distinguish closely spacedpoints) for specifying the sensitivity to smalldimensional changes. 4 References4.1 Yen, D., Linholm, L.W., and B uehler, M.G., ACross-Bridge Test Structure for Evaluating theLinewidth Uniformity of an Integrated CircuitLithography System, J.

Originally published in 1993; previously published in 1996.NOTE: These guidelines were rewritten in their entiretyin February 2000. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this guideline i s to propose a testmask to be used for evaluation of the sensitivity ofMask Defect Inspection Systems. This test maskconsists of test chips including programmed patterndefects and reference test chips without programmeddefects. Since the test chip is an assembly of cells, thetest chips are defined in this guideline by cell patterns,programmed defects in cell patterns, and the layout ofthe cells. Also, the test mask is defined by defining thetest chips arrangement. Furthermore, the use of thismask is described. It is desirable that these test masksand benchmark procedures be used when the sensitivityof a Mask Defect Inspection System is evaluated.1.2 Background  Different mask s have been used bymany equipment manufacturers and users in the past,and sensitivity has been tested by various methodsdecided independently by each manufacturer and user.In some cases, no common measurement methods orsensitivity analysis methods have been agreed upon.Therefore, confusion exists concerning the sensitivitycomparison of equipment between manufacturers, thedefinition for specifications between users andsuppliers, and the definition for specifications betweenusers. Also, due to the fact that several problems werefound when using the previous guideline in actualmanufacturing, the document has been reviewed andcontent has been changed throughout. It was also thegoal of this revision, while considering ease ofmanufacturing of test masks first, to fully cover theevaluation of mask defect inspection systems. 2 Scope2.1 This guideline defines the con tent and methods foruse of test masks used in the evaluation of mask defectinspection systems. Although it is possible to use thistest mask to evaluate transcription of defects etc., thisstandard does not attempt to define these processes. 2.2 This guideline shall be revised when a neweffective measurement technology for defect sizingbecomes commonly available in the market.2.3 This guideline does not purpor t to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this guideline to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI P1  Specification for Hard Surface PhotomaskSubstratesSEMI P22  Guideline for Photomask DefectClassification and Size Definition.SEMI P33  Provisional Specification forDevelopmental 230 mm Square Hard SurfacePhotomask SubstratesNOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 4 Terminology4.1 Definitions4.1.1 Many terms relating to photomask technologyare defined in SEMI P22 and SEMI P33.4.1.2 design pattern  pattern of in tended designdata.4.1.3 photomask pattern  pattern o n photomasksurface. 5 Mask (See Figure 1)5.1 Masks will be either 5" or 6" w hich meet SEMIP1; both the 5" and 6" will be the same layout.5.2 Masks will be limited to two ty pes, namelyConventional and Attenuated (Half Tone).
