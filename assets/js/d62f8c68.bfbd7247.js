Although such handles may extend past x53, they must still be contained within the upper limits of x50,\ny40, and r67. Handles for use by humans (if present) must follow SEMI S8, and they must require the use of both\nhands (each using a full wrap-around grip, given the minimum clearance requirement in SEMI E15.1). Automation\nhandling features shall not be considered dual purpose unless they are designed to meet SEMI S8 guidelines.\n6. 9  Automation  Handling  Features  \u2014  On  the  top  of  the  FOUP  is  a  robotic  handling  flange  for  manipulating  the\nFOUP. Shown in Figure 12 (on the top robotic handling flange) are a center hole and 3 optional kinematic grooves\n(which, if present, must be implemented entirely including the radius at the peak). On the left and right sides of the\nFOUP are optional flanges (of unspecified thickness) for use with fork lifts. On the bottom of the FOUP are rails for\nuse with roller conveyors. Although they are only required to extend x58 to the rear and y58 to the left and right, it is\nrecommended that they be as  long  as  possible.  Beyond  x58  and  y58,  only  the  lower  bounds  on  z43  and  z46  apply.\nThe side fork-lift flanges and the left and right bottom conveyor rails of the FOUP also have vertical cylindrical pin\nholes for fork lift centering. On the bottom edges of the FOUP, 2 required conveyor rails (defined by x56, x57, y58,\nand z43) are located on the left and right, and an optional conveyor rail (defined by x58, y56, y57, and z43) is located\non the rear.  The Optional Conveyor Placement Volume is a volume of space reserved for the inclusion of alternate\nconveyor  features  (defined  by  y244  and  y245,  the  Horizontal  Datum  Plane  and  z316,  and      -\u221e<x<\u221e).  The  volume\ndefined  by  the  dimensions  above  (y244, y245, z316)  is  the  maximum  volume  into  which  an  alternate  conveying\nfeature must fit.\n6. 9.1  Optional  Front  Conveyor  Surface  \u2014  Alternate  methods  of  conveyor  transport  may  require  the  use  of  the\noptional front conveyor surface.

This may be needed to prevent the FOUP from being knocked off\nthe kinematic couplings by the action of pushing the FOUP against the front-opening interface. The front retaining\nfeature  contains  a  ramp  that  a  wheel  might  roll  up  while  the  FOUP  is  being  pushed  toward  the  front-opening\ninterface. The arm with the wheel (not specified here) then holds the FOUP down on the kinematic couplings. The\ncenter  retaining  feature  consists  of  an  oblong  slot  with  a  chamber  above  it.  The  FOUP  can  be  clamped  onto  the\nkinematic couplings by inserting an oblong head on a shaft (not specified here) through the slot and rotating it 90\xb0 in\neither direction. Either retaining feature would only engage after the FOUP is fully seated on the kinematic coupling\npins. Either retaining feature must be able to withstand a force in any direction of at least f60. It is recommended that\nSEMI E15.1 tool load ports be designed to accommodate the minimum hole dimensions of the retaining features to\nensure carrier interchangeability. Projections on the tool load ports that mate with the retaining features should also\nnot  interfere  with  the  misalignment  correction  function  of  the  kinematic  couplings.  Figures  5  through  8  also  show\nfront clamp flanges and exclusion volumes (defined by x62, y60, y61, z66, z67, z68, and z69) behind them that can\nbe used to clamp the FOUP to the FOUP opener when the FOUP is purged with Nitrogen.  However, it is strongly\nrecommended  that  the  front  clamp  flanges  not  be  used  for  pulling  the  FOUP  from  the  undocked  position  into  the\nFIMS  interface.    Also,  all  of  the  dimensions  of  the  FOUP  (such  as  the  wafer  location,  etc.)  are  defined  with\nreference to the kinematic coupling pins, and most FOUPs are designed so that all of the features are in the proper\nlocation  only  when  the  FOUP  is  held  in  place  on  the  kinematic  coupling  pins  only  by  gravity.    Thus,  if  the  front\nclamp flanges are used, the wafers and the FOUP features may be in a different position than defined in SEMI E1.9\n(possibly resulting in damage to wafers, wafer handlers, and the FOUP)."),(0,o.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"11  Inner and Outer Radii \u2014 All required concave features may have a radius of up to r65 to allow cleaning and\nto prevent contaminant build-up.

Note  that  these  limits  on  the  radius  of  all\nrequired features are specified as a maximum (not a minimum) to ensure that the required features are not rounded\noff too much. The lower bound on the radius is up to the carrier supplier. Note also that this radius applies to every\nrequired feature unless another radius is called out specifically.

To make both manual and automated door opening easier, it is recommended that the holes for the\nregistration pins on the door of the FOUP  have openings with a lead-in capability.\nNOTE  A1-1:    If  the  bottom  of  the  FOUP  does  not  extend  below  the  bottom  conveyor  rail,  the  conveyor  rail  may  become\ncontaminated and may distribute particles.\nA1-6  Although both of the retaining features on the bottom of the FOUP must be able to withstand a force in any\ndirection of f60, continuously applied stress may result in plastic deformation.\nA1-7  In order to minimize particle generation when the FOUP door is opened or closed, it is recommended that the\ntolerance  between  the  FOUP  door  and  its  frame  be  larger  than  the  tolerance  between  the  FOUP  door  registration\nholes and FIMS registration pins.\nA1-8    One  type  of  carrier  presence  sensor  uses  a  beam  of  light  with  an  optical  detector  that  is  triggered  when  the\nbeam of light is attenuated as it passes through the FOUP shell.\nA1-9    The  use  of  the  registration  pins  for  FOUP  door  lead-in  to  the  loadport  door  is  not  recommended.    The\nregistration  pins  should  be  only  used  to  limit  the  maximum  displacement  of  the  FOUP  door  while  on  the  loadport\ndoor.    Neither  the  FOUP  nor  FOUP  door  positions  should  change  as  a  result  of  engaging  or  disengaging  the\nregistration  pins.    When  the  Loadport  experiences  utility  loss  (such  as  EMO,  vacuum  loss,  electrical  failure,  etc.),\nthe registration pins may be used to maintain the FOUP door\u2019s position, and to ensure that the FOUP door does not\nfall  off.    The  clearance  between  the  Registration  Pins  and  the  Registration  Pin  Holes  should  be  less  than  the\nclearance between the outer edge of the FOUP Door and the inner edge of the FOUP Door Frame.  Balancing these\ntolerances is a FOUP design issue related to the E62 Seal Zone specification.  The diameter of the Registration Pin\nHoles  should  be  designed  to  accommodate  the  Registration  Pin  tolerance  defined  in  E62  (x31, z31, d31)  and  the\nRegistration Pin Hole location tolerance in a FOUP.\nA1-10  It is recommended that the FOUP have a capability to roughly position the FOUP door in the FOUP frame\nduring the door close sequence (during either return of the FOUP door or during latching of the FOUP door).  This\npositioning capability should keep the clearance between the FOUP frame and the FOUP door larger than sum of the\nFOUP  (self)  tolerance  and  the  E62  registration  pin  tolerance  along  with  the  FOUP  door\u2019s  circumference.  Possible\nmethods  for  accomplishing  this  may  include  positioning  by  latch  motion  and  positioning  by  a  slope  between  the\nFOUP frame and the FOUP door.\nA1-11  It is recommended that the FOUP have a lead-in mechanism on its latch key holes.  This lead-in mechanism\nshould compensate for the FOUP\u2019s latch key hole location error, as shown in Figure A1-1.\nA1-12  It is recommended that the latch key hole mechanisms have some flexibility in their position for compliance\nwith the latch key positions.  The purpose of this is to adjust for any discrepancy in rotation axis between the latch\nkey  and  the  latch  key  hole  mechanism.    As  shown  in  Figure  A1-2,  if  only  one  side  of  the  latch  key  pushes  on  the\ninside of the latch key hole, the latch key can not rotate more than half way.\nA1-13  It is recommended that the torque required to rotate the FOUP latch key holes be kept small enough that it\nwill not produce movement of the FOUP door in the x and z directions during latch key rotation."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E47.1-0305 \xa9 SEMI 1997, 2005 19\nA1-14  It is recommended that the latch key holes be maintained in the position that unlocks the FOUP door from\nthe  FOUP  (\u03c8  =  0  \xb1  1\xb0  as  defined  in  SEMI  E62)  while  the  FOUP  is  open  and  in  the  position  that  locks  the  FOUP\ndoor  to  the  FOUP  (\u03c8  =  90  \xb1  1\xb0)  while  the  FOUP  is  closed.

These\nrecommendations   should   be   considered   along   with\ndesign     constraints     such     as     minimizing     liquid\nconsumption,    cost,    ensuring    maintainability,    and\nlimiting  complexity.    In  addition,  the  appropriateness\nand   simplicity   of   the   facility   interface   should   be\nconsidered.\n8. 2  Component    Recommendations    \u2014    Components\nshould  limit  system  exposure  to  ionic,  metallic,  total\norganic carbon, and particle contamination.\n8. 2.1    All  applicable  components  should  comply  with\nSEMI F57.\n8. 2.2    For  components  not  addressed  in  SEMI  F57,  a\ndiscussion  of  recommended  materials  (similar  to  that\nfound  in  SEMI  F57)  may  benefit  the  reader  and  is\ntherefore provided.\n8. 2.2.1      Care   should   be   taken   to   ensure   that   the\nmaterials  are  compatible  with  the  liquid  streams  for\nlong  term  applications.    Additionally,  it  is  important\nthat   the   materials   used   be   compatible   with   the\napplication   temperature   and/or   sanitization   methods\nsuch as ozone, UV light and/or hydrogen peroxide.\n8. 2.2.2    These  recommendations  often  imply  the  use  of\nexisting materials of choice, such as high purity grades\nof    perfluoroalkoxy    (PFA),    polytetrafluoroethylene\n(PTFE),     and     polyvinylidene     fluoride     (PVDF).\nHowever, unique design specifications or new materials\nmay  result  in  instances  where  significant  efficiencies\nmay   be   achieved   while   maintaining   substantially\nequivalent  performance.    These  scenarios  could  result\nin   the   use   of   new   or   existing   materials   such   as\nethylenechlorotrifluoroethylene    (ECTFE),    polyether-\netherketone  (PEEK),  polypropylene  (PP),  acetal  resin\n(such    as    Delrin\xae\u2122\n3\n,    Celcon\xae\u2122\n1\nand    others),\npolyvinyl  chloride  (PVC),  perfluoromethylether-based\nperfluoroalkoxy (MFA), etc.\n8. 2.2.3          Due     to     purity     and     traceability     issues,\nreprocessed or regrind material is not recommended.\n8. 3  Joining  Recommendations  \u2014  Joining  technology\nthat  is  free  of  dead  space  and  entrapment  areas  is\nrecommended   to   reduce   negative   effects   such   as\nmicrobial  proliferation  and  impacts  to  slurry  particle\nsize    distribution.        For    this    reason    pipe    thread\nconnections are not recommended.\n8. 3.1    Tubing  should  be  joined  with  flare  fittings,  or\nsimilar  dead  space  free  technology.    Preparation  and\njoining  of  fittings  should  be  performed  in  accordance\nwith component manufacturer recommendations.\n8. 3.1.1    Care  should  be  taken  to  ensure  that  dissimilar\nflare  fittings  are  not  joined  together.    When  possible,\none  style  of  fitting  should  be  used  throughout  the\nsystem.
