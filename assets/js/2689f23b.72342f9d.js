It\ndoes  not  include  a  portable  tank,  multi-unit  tank  car\ntank, cargo tank, or tank car. It also refers to non-DOT\nlow  pressure  containers  used  for  liquid  product  having\nlow vapor pressure.\n5. 4  gas source control equipment (GSCE) \u2014 Refers to\nthe  equipment  assembly  beginning  at  the  product  exit\nfrom   the   cylinder   valve   to   the   beginning   of   the\ndistribution  piping  leading  to  the  point  of  use  (POU).\nThese  assemblies  are  usually  mounted  on  panels  and\nare sometimes referred to as process panel systems.\n5. 5  hazardous  production  material  (HPM)  \u2014  A  solid,\nliquid,  or  gas  that  has  a  degree-of-hazard  rating  in\nhealth,  flammability,  or  reactivity  of  Class  3  or  4  as\nranked  by  NFPA  704  and  which  is  used  directly  in\nresearch,  laboratory,  or  production  processes  which\nhave,  as  their  end  product,  materials  which  are  not\nhazardous.\n5. 6  high  pressure  isolation  (HPI)  valve  \u2014  A  shut-off\nvalve  located  on  the  high-pressure  side  of  a  gas  piping\nsystem  that,  when  closed,  isolates  the  purged  volume\nfrom   the   pressure   regulator   and   other   downstream\ncomponents.\n5. 7  low  pressure  isolation  (LPI)  valve  \u2014  A  shut-off\nvalve  located  on  the  low-pressure  side  of  a  gas  system\nthat, when closed, isolates the purged volume from the\ndistribution     piping     and     all     other     downstream\ncomponents.\n5. 8  point of use (POU) \u2014 Refers to the manufacturing\ntool    which    uses    the    product.    Point    of    use    is\ndistinguished from the GSCE by having its own design\ncriteria, separate function, and physical separation from\nthe GSCE.\n5. 9  product \u2014 Refers to the gas phase in the cylinder.\n6  Configuration\n6. 1   Manual/Auto Operation\n6. 1.1      Manual    equipment    without    automation    is\nadequate if it includes an ASO plus excess flow device.\n(Where   required,   per   UFC   articles   51   and   80.)\nAutomated  purging  is  generally  more  efficient  than\nmanual  purging  and  is,  therefore,  recommended.  The\nASO    function    is    achieved    if    the    ASO    valve\nautomatically   defaults   to   a   closed   position   via   a\npneumatically  actuated  valve,  or  separate  actuator  that\nwill  close  a  manual  cylinder  valve.  Either  method\nshould  be  fail-safe  (default  to  a  closed  position  on  loss\nof   power   and/or   pneumatics).   This   could   also   be\ninitiated by any number of abnormal circumstances.\n6. 1.2    Fully  Automatic  \u2014   This  is  a  broad  category  of\ndesigns  using  any  number  of  transducers,  remotely\noperated  valves,  and  logic  to  accomplish  safeguarding,\nmonitoring,  and  automatic  purging.  Extension  of  this\napproach   to   central   data   collection,   analysis,   and\nreporting via computers and special programs offers the\ncapability  of  further  reducing  hazards  and  enhancing\nsafety.\n6. 2  Cylinder Connections\n6. 2.1  Compressed  gas  cylinders  are  connected  to  the\npanel  equipment  using  the  connection  on  the  outlet  of\nthe  cylinder  valve.  The  appropriate  regulatory  agency\nhas   designated   one   or   more   connections   for   each\nproduct gas.\n6. 2.2  Other containers for liquid or low vapor pressure\nmaterials  may  require  the  connection  of  two  fittings.\nOne   of   these   is   used   to   admit   gas,   which   either\npressurizes  the  product,  allowing  liquid  withdrawal,  or\nabsorbs  the  product,  allowing  withdrawal  of  a  gas-\nphase  mixture  of  the  product  and  the  gas.  The  other\nfitting is used for withdrawal. The types and labeling of\nthe connections vary among suppliers.\n6. 2.3  High    Pressure    Pigtail    \u2014    A    semi-flexible\nassembly  of  piping,  subjected  to  cylinder  pressure,\nwhich  is  used  to  connect  the  cylinder  to  the  rigidly\nmounted  components  on  the  panel.  The  intent  of  this\nflexible assembly is to accommodate the location of the\ncylinder outlet.\n6. 2.4  No  Pigtail  \u2014  An  alternate  acceptable  method\nallows cylinders to be elevated or lowered to match the\nfixed  height  of  the  connection  point  on  fixed  panel\nequipment.\n6. 3  Cross Contamination\n6. 3.1  Purge  Gas  Cylinder  Contamination  by  Process\nGas \u2014 Purge gas is supplied from cylinders, with each\npurge gas cylinder limited to a single process gas panel\nor  several  panels  using  the  same  process  gas  class  or"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F13-1101 \xa9 SEMI 1993, 20013\ndifferent mixture ratios of the same process gas class. A\ncheck valve should be installed in each line connecting\nthe purge gas to the process panel equipment.\n6. 3.2  Process  Gas  Cylinder  Contamination  by  Purge\nGas  \u2014  The  purpose  of  purging  is  to  remove  air  or\nresidual  process  gas  from  the  panel  equipment  (or  part\nof  it)  back  to  the  internal  cavity  of  the  closed  cylinder\nvalve.\nWARNING:    Check  valves  are  not  acceptable  in  this\npart  of  the  process  gas  system  because  purging  would\nbe defeated. Cross contamination can only be prevented\nby  safeguards  which  assure  complete  cylinder  valve\nclosure and process gas venting, before purging begins.\n6. 4    Materials  \u2014  All  materials  furnished  should  be\nmanufactured    to    nationally    recognized    standards.\nMetals used for the wetted surfaces should be type 3l6L\nstainless  steel,  or  other  materials  that  provide  equal  or\nimproved   compatibility   with   the   gas   in   service.\nNonmetallic  seals  that  are  used  in  valve  or  regulator\nseats  must  also  be  compatible  with  the  product  in\nservice.\n6. 5    Joints  \u2014  All  welded  joints  should  be  butt  welded\n(no  socket  welds)  and  should  comply  with  SEMI  F3.\nConnection fittings should be face seal type.\n6. 6     Particle   Control   \u2014   Particle   contamination   is\ncontrolled  through  the  proper  selection  of  components\nand   system   hardware,   good   design   practices,   clean\nfabrication   methods,   and   proper   operation   of   the\nsystem.\n6. 7   Internal Volume \u2014 The internal cavities should be\nconfigured   for   minimum   surface   area   and   internal\nvolume  to  enhance  purging.  Dead  end  legs  should  be\neliminated or kept to a minimum volume and length.\n6. 8   Maintainability \u2014 Planned maintenance or forced\nrepair   is   facilitated   or   inhibited   by   specific   design\nconcepts and features. From a safety point of view, it is\nmandatory  to  be  able  to  purge  the  entire  GSCE  (all\ncavities)   and   to   have   a   downstream   shutoff   (low\npressure isolation valve) and disconnect fitting.\n7   Performance Recommendations\n7. 1   Functional Recommendations\n7. 1.1    The  ASO  should  be  designed  to  close  based  on\nan  alarm  or  fail  signal  from  an  auxiliary  component.  It\nshould  be  designed  to  fail  closed  and  should  have  a\nworking pressure at least 1.1 times the product cylinder\npressure.  If  a  pressure  sensor  is  located  between  the\nASO and the cylinder valve, as depicted in Figure 1, it\nshould  also  have  a  working  pressure  at  least  1.1  times\nthe product cylinder pressure.\n7. 1.2      Pressure    Reduction    \u2014    Gases    are    most\ncommonly  required  at  POU  at  less  than  100  psig.\nCylinder pressure is reduced to the lower pressure by a\ngas pressure regulator, when necessary.\nCONNECTION\nFigure 1\nTypical Gas Source Control System"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F13-1101 \xa9 SEMI 1993, 20014\n7. 1.3  Excess Pressure Control \u2014 Provisions should be\nmade  to  protect  the  distribution  piping  and  process\nequipment  from  excessive  pressure.  This  protection\nmay  include  a  pressure  transducer,  pressure  switch,  or\nindicating  transmitter  connected  to  close  the  ASO,  a\nrelief  valve  piped  into  the  exhaust,  or  a  redundant\npressure    regulator    with    primary    regulator    failure\nindication.\n7. 1.4  Cylinder  Contents  \u2014  The  product  remaining  in\nthe cylinder is determined by gas pressure measured by\neither  a  pressure  transducer  or  gauge,  or  in  the  case  of\nmaterial  in  liquid/vapor  phase,  by  the  cylinder  weight\nmeasured by a scale.\n7. 1.5  Delivery  Pressure  \u2014  The  pressure  delivered  by\nthe  regulator  is  displayed  by  a  pressure  indicator.  This\ncan be either a gauge or transducer readout.\n7. 1.6  Filters    \u2014    Particles    from    ambient    sources,\nentering  with  the  product  or  generated  by  the  system\nelements,  can  be  captured  by  including  one  or  more\nfilters  at  a  variety  of  locations  within  the  system.  This\npractice   tends   to   protect   the   components   and   the\nprocess.\n7. 1.7  Purge    Gas    Connection    \u2014    A    purge    gas\nconnection  is  provided  via  a  branched  connection  to\nadmit  clean,  dry,  inert  purge  gas  through  an  on-off\nvalve.  This  is  commonly  located  between  the  cylinder\nconnection  and  high  pressure  isolation  valve  in  the\npanel  system.  Gas  purging  is  used  for  installation  of  a\nnew system, before disconnecting a spent cylinder, after\nconnecting   a   fresh   cylinder,   and   for   removal   of\nequipment for maintenance purposes.\n7. 1.8  Vent  Outlets  \u2014  The  normal  purpose  of  the  vent\nvalves is to discharge process gas, air, and purge gas in\nconjunction   with   purging   operations.   Under   special\ncircumstances,  they  are  used  to  reduce  pressure  in  the\nequipment  and/or  transfer  product.  One  or  more  vents\nmay  be  used  at  various  locations,  and  downstream\nventing  may  be  either  atmospheric  pressure  or  vacuum\nfrom  a  venturi  or  pump.

The\nlack  of  measurable  tracer  indicates  that  the  release  of\npotentially   hazardous   gases   or   vapors   within   the\nenclosure  at  the  tracer  injection  point(s)  will  not  result\nin  their  migration  to  the  outside  of  the  enclosure.    Gas\nsamples  are  taken  by  means  of  disposable  syringes,\nsample   bags,   or   sample   vials.      Gas   samples   are\nanalyzed     by     means     of     electron     capture     gas\nchromatography.\n7  Procedure\n7. 1  Test Design\n7. 1.1  Determine the type of enclosure to be tested, such\nas:   non-access,   access,   vacuum   pump,   equipment\ncabinet, or other.\n7. 1.2  Determine the volume of the enclosure.\n7. 1.3  Measure    the    exhaust    flow    rate    from    the\nenclosure.\n7. 1.4  Calculate   the   air   changes   per   minute   of   the\nenclosure  by  dividing  the  exhaust  flow  rate  (Section\n7. 1.3) by the enclosure volume (Section 7.1.2).\n7. 1.5  Calculate    the    time    at    which    the    tracer\nconcentration in the enclosure will achieve approximate\nequilibrium.    Concentration  equilibrium  occurs  when\nthe tracer concentration in the enclosure stops changing\nas  a  function  of  time  for  a  constant  tracer  release  rate.\nDivide 3 by the air changes per minute to establish this\ntime.  Use this as the time to take the first sample after\ninitiating  a  test.    Appendix  1  provides  a  derivation  of\nthe equilibrium time.\nNOTE 1:  This test method is intended to test the containment\nability  of  the  local  exhaust  system  within  an  enclosure  when\noperated according to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. Thus,\ntesting  should  be  performed  with  the  local  exhaust  operating\nunder its manufacturer's recommended conditions.\n7. 1.6  If   an   excess   flow   control   system   is   used,\ndetermine the trip point for each hazardous gas used.  If\ndifferent gases are used in the enclosure, the largest trip\npoint should be used to calculate the tracer release flow\nrate.\n7. 1.7  If   no   excess   flow   system   or   flow-restricting\norifice  is  used,  the  maximum  accidental  release  rate\nmust  be  calculated  from  the  known  maximum  system\npressure and either valve coefficients or tubing ID.  An\nequation for flow through straight tubing is provided in\nAppendix 2.\n7. 1.8  In  the  absence  of  guidance  in  the  above  two\nsections,  a  standard  test  is  the  release  of  tracer  gas\nthrough  6.35  mm  (0.25  inch)  OD  by  0.89  mm  (0.035\ninch)  wall  tubing  at  a  rate  of  28  standard  liters  per\nminute  (slpm)  (1  scfm).    Appendix  3  derives  a  general\nequation,  A3-7,  that  can  be  used  when  this  is  not  the\ncase.\n7. 2  Reagents  and  Materials \u23af  Use  SF\n6\ndiluted  in  an\ninert gas, such as nitrogen or argon, as the tracer source,\nto  minimize  measurement  difficulties  associated  with\nsmall leaks of pure SF\n6\nfrom the supply cylinder and its\nassociated piping.\n7. 3  Sampling\n7. 3.1  In  selecting  the  location  of  samples  collected\noutside the enclosure, consider 1) potential leak points,\n2)  the  direction  of  the  release,  and  3)  laminar  flow\ncharacteristics  in  the  area  surrounding  the  enclosure.\nSamples  should  be  collected  from  all  sides  of  the\nenclosure, downstream in the prevailing room air flow,\nand in the operating personnel occupancy areas.\n7. 3.2  The  time  required  for  the  enclosure  to  reach\nequilibrium should be considered when establishing the\ntime to begin sampling.  The first sample after initiating\ntracer flow should be taken at the enclosure equilibrium\ntime.    Collect  additional  samples  at  1  to  2  minute\nintervals until the tracer source is shut off.  One sample\nshould be taken 1 minute after the tracer source is shut\noff.  The test duration can be changed to accommodate\na particular test.\n7. 3.3  Collect  background  (baseline)  samples  from  the\narea    surrounding    the    enclosure    at    predetermined\nlocations.        When    logistics    permit,    analyze    the\nbackground  samples  before  releasing  the  tracer  gas.  If\nbackground   levels   above   approximately   1   ppb   are\ndetected,   evaluate   the   integrity   of   the   SF\n6\ntracer\ndelivery   system,   and   postpone   the   test   until   the\nconcentration  is  less  than  1  ppb.

The composition of 316L specified in Table I of ASTM A 182/A 182M, ASTM A 240,\nASTM  A  269,  ASTM  A  276,  ASTM  A  479/A  479M,  or  ASTM  A  632,  has  a  maximum  of  0.030  percent  Sulfur;\nhowever several properties affecting the manufacture and applications of 316L can vary significantly over this range\nof Sulfur content.  Therefore a lower Sulfur maximum is specified in SEMI F20, as listed in \xb66.3.2 and Table 1 of\n\xb66.3.3.\nA1-2.2  Sulfur  has  a  very  low  solubility  in  austenitic  stainless  steels,  thus  in  these  alloys  it  exists  as  discrete\ninclusions  of  Manganese  Sulfide,  with  some  solubility  for  Chromium  as  well  as  other  trace  elements.  These\ninclusions can initiate pits and other defects on electropolished surfaces, increasing in number with increasing Sulfur\ncontent.\nA1-2.3  The  Manganese  Sulfide  inclusions  improve  the  machinability  of  stainless  steel;  compositions  intended  for\nmachining have Sulfur compositions near the 0.030 percent maximum, whereas stainless steels with very low Sulfur\nlevels require lower feeds and speeds and will cause reduced tool life during machining.\nA1-2.4  Sulfur  also  strongly  affects  welding  of  stainless  steel;  variation  of  Sulfur  from  very  low  contents  to  the\nmaximum  permitted  can  increase  weld  bead  penetration  by  approximately  a  factor  of  two  for  similar  weld\nparameters.\nA1-2.5  The effects of Sulfur are summarized in Table A1-1.\nA1-2 Welding Effects of Sulfur\nA1-2.1  Two effects are observed on welding with variations in Sulfur level:\nA1-2.1.1  As Sulfur is reduced the heat input required for full penetration increases.\nA1-2.1.2  As Sulfur is reduced below approximately 0.005 percent there is a marked change in weld pool dynamics,\ncausing the weld pool to become wider and shallower\n2\n.\nTable A1-1 \u2013 Effects of Sulfur on Austenitic Stainless Steels\nAs Sulfur increases from zero to the 0.030% maximum permitted:\nEffects                                                                                             Results\nMachinability improves.\n\u2013 Lower machining costs for machined parts.\nInclusion density increases.\n\u2013 More pits, stringers, other defects on surface.\n\u2013 Decreased corrosion resistance, particularly on end grains.\nWelding penetration increases.\n\u2013 Weld settings must be reset when changing lots.\n\u2013 Problems welding materials with dissimilar Sulfur contents."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"2    K.

It is not an intentional addition, but is present in\nany  heat  of  material  as  a  result  of  the  composition  of  the  furnace  charge  materials  used,  which  are  typically\nprimarily scrap with elemental and master alloy additions to achieve the composition desired. Levels of unspecified\nelements  such  as  Copper  are  permitted  up  to  0.50%  maximum  by  AMS  2248E\n4\n.    Copper  content  can  only  be\nreduced in the melt by dilution. Over time, as more scrap material is recycled, the residual levels of copper in heats\nof AISI 316L is anticipated to increase.\nA2-1.2  Copper  is  an  austenite  phase  stabilizer.    It  also  has  been  shown  to  improve  the  resistance  of  austenitic\nstainless steels to stress corrosion cracking in chloride solutions.\nA2-2 Effects of Copper on Welding\nA2-2.1  In  welding,  copper  is  a  surface-active  element  (like  S,  O,  and  Se)  and  has  been  shown  to  contribute\nsignificantly to weld bead meander. Like manganese, it will volatilize during welding and redeposit downstream of\nthe weld, providing a site for the initiation of corrosion in some conditions. Some end users may restrict copper as a\npotential source of weld contamination or corrosion.\nA2-2.2  A correlation was noted between increased copper content and weld bead meander in a wafer fab project\n5\n.\nFive  heats  of  0.25  in.  tubing  were  evaluated.  Copper  was  very  prominent  in  the  HAZ  of  one  heat  (0.47%  Cu  and\n0. 011% S) which had a bead meander problem when welded.  Another heat with the same sulfur content and a lower\ncopper content (0.03% Cu) did not exhibit bead meander. Another heat (0.31% Cu and 0.010% S) showed oxidation\nafter welding. All welds were performed in argon.\nA2-2.3  In a study of 28 heats of tubing from 0.25 to 2.0 inch in diameter, copper ranged from 0.05 to 0.41%\n6\n. Of\nthe  28  heats  tested,  10  had  copper  contents  above  0.25%,  and  among  the  nine  heats  of  2.0  in.  diameter  tubing,  all\nhad  copper  levels  above  0.22%,  with  four  of  the  heats  above  0.25%.  Cosmetically  unacceptable  welds  (slag,\ndiscoloration and/or bead meander) occurred on heats with: 0.26% Cu, 0.005% S; 0.28% Cu, 0.009% S; and 0.41%\nCu, 0.005% S.  Conversely, cosmetically acceptable welds were performed on a heat with 0.3% Cu and 0.011% S.\nAll welds were performed using argon.\nA2-2.4  Data  was  presented  at  a  SEMI  Workshop  and  repeated  here  concerning  the  effect  of  copper  content  and\nshield gas interactions on weldability\n7\n. Two examples of heats of AISI 316L tubing, 2.5 in. in diameter, with copper\ncontents above 0.3%, demonstrated that adding hydrogen to the argon shield gas adversely affected the weldability\nof the tubing (see Figure A2-1). This same effect was not noted in heats of tubing with copper levels below 0.3%. In\naddition, the weld electrodes undergo severe degradation when welding tubing with copper contents above 0.3% and\nusing Ar/H\n2\nshield gas (see Figure A2-2).\nA2-2.5  Based on the above information, the following conclusions can be made:\nA2-2.5.1  The  copper  restriction  in  SEMI  F20  currently  stands  at  0.30%.
