SEMI E26-92 (Withdrawn 1104)
RADIAL CLUSTER TOOL FOOTPRINT STANDARD
This  standard  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Physical  Interfaces  &  Carriers  Committee  and  is  the
direct  responsibility  of  the  North  American  Physical  Interfaces  &  Carriers  Committee.  Current  edition
reapproved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on August 16 2004.  Initially available at
www.semi.org  September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.    Originally  published  in  1992;  last
published June 1999.
Minor editorial changes were made to this document to conform to editorial guidelines.
NOTICE:  This  document  was  balloted  and  approved
for withdrawal in 2004.
1  Introduction
1. 1  Scope   —   The   standard   specifies   the   footprints
within  which  the  modules  of  a  radial  cluster  tool  must
be accommodated and the restricted areas between such
footprints.  The  standard  also  applies  to  those  portions
of  nonradial  cluster  tools  that  possess  radial  elements.
The  standard  is  limited  to  wafers  200  mm  (8  in.)  in
diameter or smaller.
1. 2  Purpose  —  The  purpose  of  the  standard  is  to
ensure  that  modules  from  different  suppliers  can  be
integrated  into  a  radial  cluster  tool.  It  provides  design
specifications   to   equipment   manufacturers   so   that
physical  interference  between  adjacent  modules  in  a
radial  cluster  tool  is  avoided  and  access  to  all  modules
of the cluster tool is guaranteed.
1. 3  Impact    —    The    standard    requires    equipment
designers to ensure that modules attached to a transport
module  be  confined  within  a  specific  footprint  and  its
vertical boundaries.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

the shaded region between adjoining module footprints
in  Figure  1  (see  Section  R1-7).  Furthermore,  utilities
are  restricted  from  entering  the  module  through  the
vertical  planes  bordering  the  module  footprint  (see
SEMI E25).
4. 3   Restriction  on  Alpha  —  The  values  of  alpha  (see
Table 1) are restricted to 36° ≤ α ≤ 90° (see Section R1-
8).
4. 4    Module   Connect   and   Disconnect   —   Space   for
module  connect  to  and  disconnect  from  the  transport
module  and  for  any  related  tools  must  be  provided  by
the  module  manufacturer  within  the  boundaries  of  the
module   footprint   and   the   adjacent   restricted   areas.
Access from any other module footprint, including that
of the transport module, is not allowed (see Section R1-
9).

RELATED INFORMATION 1
NOTE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of
SEMI  E26  but  was  reapproved  for  publication  by  full  letter
ballot procedures on February 28, 1999.
R1-1  Alpha Values
R1-1.1  A transport module in the shape of an N-sided
regular polygon possesses an alpha value of 360/N (see
Section 4.1 and Figure 1).
R1-2  Transport Module Side Length
R1-2.1    The  specified  transport  module  side  length  (L)
of  420  mm  (16.54  in.)  given  in  Table  2  is  a  minimum
value  that  will  ensure  clearance  at  the  interface  plane
valve (see SEMI E21), assuming a 340 mm (13.39 in.)
flange   width   at   the   interface   plane   plus   additional
clearance  for  side-mounted  clamps.  The  side  length  is
specified  as  a  minimum  value  since  a  single  transport
module  could  have  various  side  lengths  and/or  alpha
values.  Longer  side  lengths  may  ease  access  to  the
transport  module,  but  will  have  the  negative  impact  of
increasing   the   transport   module   handler   extension,
which is the distance from the common point (in Figure
1)  to  the  wafer  transport  position  (defined  in  SEMI
E22). For a radial cluster tool with the transport module
handler  having  the  "home"  position  at  the  common
point,  the  maximum  extension  in  millimeters  is  related
to  the  side  length,  alpha,  and  the  transport  maximum
reach,  which  is  specified  as  305  mm  (12  in.)  in  SEMI
E21 by:

R1-3  Evaluation of Footprint Shapes
R1-3.1    Access  (see  Section  4.1)  for  a  variety  of
purposes  is  severely  restricted  in  a  radial  cluster  tool,
because   all   modules   converge   toward   one   areR1-
Achieving access to clamps at the interface plane and to
the  module  (usually  a  process  module)  in  proximity  to
the  interface  plane  is  especially  difficult.  Thus,  several
footprint  shapes  were  modelled:  A  radial  architecture
comprising   an   N-sided   regular   polygon   transport
module with L = 420 mm (see Table 2 and Section R1-
2) was used, and the dimensional effects on the module
footprint were investigated for 4 ≤ N ≤ 10. Anatomical
data was used to evaluate access to various parts of the
radial cluster tool. The configuration chosen provides a
short, fat footprint. It allows maximum freedom for the
module  designer  and  accommodates  modules  near  the
interface plane without forcing the design of additional
wafer  transport  mechanisms.  Guidance  in  setting  W1
and W2 values (see Figure 1) was provided by the need
for  a  single  wafer  sputter  module  to  be  placed  directly
on  an  N  =  8  regular  polygon  transport  module  and  a
batch  processing  module  with  an  intermediate  "buffer"
station on the same transport module.
R1-4  Module Width at Interface Plane
R1-4.1  Although L can be longer than 420 mm (16.54
in.), the module attached to the transport module cannot
possess  a  width  greater  than  400  mm  (15.75  in.)  at  the
interface plane in order to be interchangeable among all
transport module interfaces (see Figure 1).
R1-5  Flexibility for Module Suppliers
R1-5.1    Module  footprint  dimensions  (calculated  from
the   expressions   in   Table   2)   and   transport   module
handler  extensions  (calculated  from  the  expression  in
Section  R1-2)  for  L  =  420  mm  and  for  selected  values
of alpha are given in Table A1 to provide guidance for
weighing design targets. Alpha values corresponding to
values  of  N  for  an  N-sided  regular  polygon  transport
module are noted.
R1-5.2    Modules  designed  for  an  N  =  8  (α  =  45º)
transport  module  will  fit  on  any  transport  module  with
N ≤  8  (α ≤  45º),  providing  for  greater  flexibility,  but
possessing  a  more  restrictive  footprint,  than  a  module
designed for an N = 6 (α = 60º) transport module.
R1-6  Nonradial Cluster Tool Applicability
R1-6.1  An example of a nonradial transport module is
shown  in  Figure  R1-1.  Sides  1,  3,  4,  and  5  of  the
transport module are equivalent to a radial cluster tool.
The  standard  applies  to  these  four  sides  (see  Section
4. 1).
R1-7  Restricted Areas
R1-7.1      Access   (see   Section   4.2)   for   maintenance
activities  that  involve  the  lifting  of  heavy  components
or  crouching,  requires  a  minimum  separation  of  2  AM
= 915 mm (36 in.) between integrated module hardware
(see Table 2). When a width of 915 mm (36 in.) for the
entire restricted area was used in the model (see Section
R1-3),   it   became   apparent   that   footprints   would
comprise narrow corridors. This would force the design
of   buffer   chambers   and   additional   wafer   handling
mechanisms   for   many   applications.   For   practical
purposes,  the  concept  of  a  smaller  reach  area  (the
hatched  region  in  Figure  R1-2),  where  the  module
should be detached from the transport module for heavy
lifting or crouching tasks, was considered acceptable.



SEMI E26-92 © SEMI 1992, 2004 5
R1-7.2    Dependence  on  L  —  A  transport  module  side
length (L) greater than the minimum value of 420.0 mm
will  result  in  a  larger  restricted  area  by  increasing  the
half  widths  A
M
,  A
R
,  and  a
α
beyond  their  respective
minimum   values   of   457.5   mm,   360.0   mm,   and
10×cos[α/2] mm (see Table 2).
R1-7.3      Restricted   Area   Temporary   Residence   —
Equipment   such   as   roll-out   drawers   or   swing-out
equipment may temporarily reside in the restricted area
(see Section 4.2).
R1-8  Restriction on Alpha
R1-8.1  The maximum value of alpha was based on an
N  =  4  (α  =  90º)  regular  polygon  transport  module
design (see Section 4.3).
R1-8.2      In   order   for   a   module   manufacturer   to
adequately  design  for  access,  some  knowledge  of  the
adjacent  modules  must  be  available.  This  can  be  done
by  setting  a  minimum  value  for  alpha,  which  then
defines   the   adjacent   footprint   leading   to   the   most
stringent  "half"  access  area.  For  the  purposes  of  the
standard, the minimum value of alpha was based on an
N = 10 (α = 36º) regular polygon transport module (see
Figure R1-2).
R1-9  Module Connect and Disconnect
R1-9.1    The  number  of  components  and  the  degree  of
complexity  at  the  interfaces  of  a  radial  cluster  tool  are
high. To ensure non-interference between modules, the
concept  of  an  impenetrable  wall  at  the  interface  plane
and  adjacent  module  footprints  should  be  used.  Within
this   area,   requirements   for   module   connect   and
disconnect    are    the    responsibility    of    the    module
manufacturer (see Section 4.4).

RELATED INFORMATION 1
NOTE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of
SEMI E26.1 but was reapproved for publication by full letter
ballot procedures on February 28, 1999.
R1-1  Interface Plane Reach Dimension
R1-1.1    The  320.0  mm  slant  distance  adjacent  to  the
interface    plane    (see    Figure    1    in    SEMI    E26)
accommodates   the   reach   of   the   human   arm   and
therefore applies to the 200 mm standard and to the 300
mm standard (see Section 3.1).
R1-2  Large Modules
R1-2.1    Large  modules  such  as  batch  process  modules
can  be  accommodated  in  the  region  of  the  module
footprint  defined  by  the  width  W2  (see  Figure  1  in
SEMI  E26).  An  increase  in  the  slant  distance  between
X2  and  X3  from  270.0  mm  to  420.0  mm  leads  to  an
increase  in  W2  sufficient  to  accommodate  most  large
modules (see Section 3.1).
R1-3  Selected Design Data
R1-3.1    The  transport  module  handler  extension  is  the
distance from the common point (see SEMI E26) to the
wafer transport position (defined in SEMI E22, "Cluster
Tool Module Interface: Transport Module End Effector
Exclusion Volume Standard"). The maximum extension
in  millimeters  is  related  to  L,  alpha,  and  the  transport
maximum   reach   (specified   as   380.0   mm   in   SEMI
E21.1,   "Cluster   Tool   Module   Interface   300   mm:
Mechanical  Interface  and  Wafer  Transport  Standard")

R1-3.2      Transport   module   handler   extensions   and
module   footprint   dimensions   (calculated   from   the
expressions in Table 1) for selected values of alpha are
given  in  Table  R1-1.  Alpha  values  corresponding  to
values  of  N  for  an  N-sided  regular  polygon  transport
module are noted (see Section 3.2).
R1-4  Restriction on Alpha
R1-4.1    If  α  <  45 ̊  (N  >  8  for  an  N-sided  regular
polygon  transport  module),  process  modules  must  be
reduced  in  size  or  located  further  from  the  interface
plane than would be the case for 45 ̊ ≤ α ≤ 90 ̊.

SEMI E27-92 (Reapproved 1104)
STANDARD FOR MASS FLOW CONTROLLER AND MASS FLOW
METER LINEARITY
This  standard  was  technically  reapproved  by  the  Facilities  Committee  and  is  the  direct  responsibility  of  the
North American Facilities Committee.  Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards
Committee in July 11, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to be published November

# 2004

2004.  Originally published in 1992.
1  Purpose
1. 1  The  purpose  of  this  standard  is  to  establish  a
uniform,  worldwide  definition  of  linearity  in  order  to
prevent    confusion    and    misunderstanding    between
manufacturers  and  users  of  mass  flow  devices.    A
linearity  specification  is  used  to  allow  prediction  to  a
known  level  of  uncertainty,  the  output  of  an  MFC  at
points other than those at which its output is known.
2  Scope
2. 1  The scope is to define the linearity of the mass flow
controller  (controller  with  integral  flow  transducer  and
control valve) and the mass flow meter (flow transducer
only).    Terminal-based  linearity  is  used  to  describe  the
linearity of MFCs and MFMs.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Background
3. 1  There    are    three    commonly-used    methods    of
describing linearity:  independent, zero-referenced, and
terminal-based  linearity.    Terminal-based  linearity  best
describes  the  performance  requirements  for  MFCs  and
MFMs because of its ease of application.  In addition, it
also  yields  the  maximum  expression  of  deviation.    See
reference  documents  regarding  independent  and  zero-
referenced linearity.

5. 1  Definitions (See Figures 1 and 2)
5. 1.1  actual  flow  —  the  gas  flow  as  measured  by  an
external  standard,  not  the  electrical  output  of  a  mass
flow meter (see Section 4.2).
5. 1.2  linearity   —   the   closeness   to   which   a   curve
approximates  a  straight  line.  It  is  measured  as  a  non-
linearity and expressed as a linearity (see Section 4.2).
5. 1.3  lower range input value — lowest value of input
at which the instrument is specified to operate.  In mass
flow  controllers  this  is  zero  or  the  lowest  set  point  at
which the instrument is specified.  In mass flow meters
this is no flow or the lowest actual flow value at which
the instrument is specified.
5. 1.4  range  —  the  region  between  the  limits  within
which  a  quantity  is  measured,  expressed  by  stating  the
lower and upper range values (see Section 4.2).
5. 1.5  span  —  the  algebraic  difference  between  the
upper and lower range values.
e.g.,
Range  =  4% to 100%,  Span  =   96%
Range  =  0% to 100%,  Span  = 100%
5. 1.6  terminal-Based  linearity  —  maximum  deviation
of  the  calibration  curve  from  a  straight  line  which
intercepts the calibration curve at upper and lower input
range values.
5. 1.7  upper  range  input  value  —  Highest  value  of
input at which the instrument is specified to operate.  In
mass flow controllers this is full scale or the highest set
point at which the instrument is specified.  In mass flow

at which the instrument is specified.
6  Significance and Use
6. 1  The  linearity  of  a  mass  flow  controller  (MFC)  is
expressed   in   terms   of   its   actual   flow   output   as   a
function  of  the  setpoint  input  (control  voltage)  (see
Figure 2).
6. 2  The  linearity  of  a  mass  flow  meter  (MFM)  is
expressed  in  terms  of  its  electrical  output  as  a  function
of the actual flow (input) through the device (see Figure
1).
6. 3  Terminal-based  linearity  shall  be  used  to  describe
the  linearity  of  MFCs  and  MFMs.    The  maximum
deviation  is  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  algebraic
difference  between  the  output  at  the  upper  range  value
and the output at the lower range value.

GUIDELINE FOR PRESSURE SPECIFICATIONS OF THE MASS FLOW
CONTROLLER
This guideline was technically reapproved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility of
the North American Gases Committee.  Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards
Committee in July 11, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to be published November
2004.  Originally published in 1992; last published February 1999.
1  Purpose
1. 1  The  purpose  of  this  guideline  is  to  establish  a
uniform,    worldwide    means    to    describe    pressure
parameters as they relate to mass flow controllers.  It is
intended  to  prevent  confusion  and  misunderstanding
between manufacturers and users.
2  Scope
2. 1  This  guideline  contains  definitions  of  terms  which
describe  gas  pressure  in  mass  flow  controllers  as  used
in   the   semiconductor   industry.      SI   units   are   the
reference units for this document.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

cited shall be the latest published versions.
4  Terminology
4. 1  Definitions
4. 1.1  units  of  pressure  —  several  units  of  pressure  are
commonly used in conjunction with MFCs.  The Pascal
is  the  preferred  unit  of  pressure  for  use  within  the
semiconductor  industry.    Units  of  pressure  include  the
following:
• Pascal (Pa)
• Pounds per square inch (psi)
• Torr (T)
• Kilograms per square centimeter (kg/cm
2
)
• Bar (B)
NOTE 1:  Units  of  pressure  are  sometimes  expressed  as  an
equivalent   height   of   a   column   of   some   liquid,   such   as
millimeters  of  mercury  or  inches  of  water.    These  units
require  correction  to  some  standard  for  liquid  density  and
gravity.  As these corrections are neither broadly standardized
nor often even addressed, their use should be avoided.
4. 1.2  absolute   pressure   —   the   pressure   measured
relative  to  zero  pressure  (perfect  vacuum)  (see  Figure
1).
NOTE 2:  Absolute  pressure  is  the  pressure  illustrated  by  the
ideal gas law, PV = nRT.  For example, when the number of
moles,  n,  equals  zero  (no  molecules),  absolute  pressure,  P,
equals  zero.    To  indicate  unambiguously  that  a  pressure
measurement  is  absolute,  the  following  abbreviations  should
be used:
• Pa — Pascal (absolute assumed)
• psi (a) — Pounds per square inch, absolute
• Torr — Torr (absolute assumed)
• kg/cm
2
(a) — Kilograms per square centimeter, absolute
• B (a) — Bar, absolute
4. 1.2.1  Units  such  as  Pascal  and  Torr  are  customarily
absolute units.

4. 1.3  ambient  pressure  —  the  absolute  pressure  of  the
medium surrounding the MFC (see Figure 2).


Figure 2
Pressure Definitions for MFCs

4. 1.4  burst  pressure  —  the  gas  pressure  at  which  the
MFC may rupture.
4. 1.5  differential pressure — the difference in absolute
pressure   between   two   points   of   measurement   in   a
system (see Figure 3).

measurement   is   differential,   the   following   abbreviations
should be used:
• Pa (d) — Pascal, differential
• psi (d) — Pounds per square inch, differential
• Torr (d) — Torr, differential
• kg/cm
2
(d)    —    Kilograms    per    square    centimeter,
differential
• B (d) — Bar, differential
4. 1.5.1  Gauge   pressures   may   also   be   used   in   the
differential    pressure    calculation    if    consistency    is
maintained.    A  common  error  would  be  to  take  the
difference between an inlet gauge pressure and an outlet
absolute  pressure  without  first  converting  to  common
units.
4. 1.5.2  As it applies to an MFC, differential pressure is
usually  the  measured  difference  in  pressures  between
the gas inlet and outlet fittings of the MFC.

Figure 3
Definition of Differential Pressure for MFCs


4. 1.6  gauge   pressure   —   the   differential   pressure
measured  relative  to  ambient  pressure.    For  example,
when the pressure within a system equals the prevailing
ambient  pressure,  the  gauge  pressure  equals  zero  (see
Figure 1).
NOTE 4:  To    indicate    unambiguously    that    a    pressure
measurement is gauge, the following abbreviations should be
used:
• Pa (g) — Pascal, gauge
• psi (g) — Pounds per square inch, gauge
• Torr (g) — Torr, gauge
• kg/cm
2
— Kilograms per square centimeter, gauge
• B (g) — Bar, gauge
NOTE 5:  The  performance  of  MFCs  can  vary  significantly
with  gas  density.    Atmospheric  pressure  varies  with  the
weather and altitude at various geographical locations.  Gauge
pressure   units   commonly   reference   atmospheric   pressure.
Therefore,  the  same  gauge  pressures  measured  at  different
geographical   locations   may   correspond   to   different   gas
densities.    For  this  reason,  the  use  of  gauge  pressure  units
with MFCs can be imprecise and should be avoided.
4. 1.7  inlet  pressure  —  the  pressure  at  the  inlet  fitting
of the MFC (see Figure 3).
4. 1.8  maximum   operating   pressure   —   operation   is
permitted  up  to  this  inlet  pressure,  but  performance  is
not  specified  above  normal  operating  pressure  (see
Figure 2).
4. 1.9  maximum  overrange  pressure  —  the  maximum
gas  pressure  to  which  the  MFC  may  be  subjected
without   degrading   specified   performance.      When
returned  to  normal  operating  pressure,  the  MFC  must
require    no    adjustment    to    return    to    specified
performance (see Figure 2).


SEMI E28-92 © SEMI 1992, 2004 3
4. 1.10  MFC  calibration  pressure,  inlet  and  outlet  —
the  inlet  and  outlet  pressure  at  which  the  MFC  was
calibrated (see Figure 2).
4. 1.11  normal  operating  pressure,  inlet  and  outlet  —
the  pressure  range  within  which  the  MFC  meets  its
stated performance specifications (see Figure 2).
4. 1.12  normal  operating  differential  pressure  —  the
range   of   differential   pressure   (see   Section   4.1.5)
required  by  the  MFC  to  meet  its  stated  performance
specifications.
NOTE 6:  The upper and lower limits are dependent upon the
absolute    inlet    or    outlet    pressure.        These    limits    are
manufacturer-specific.
4. 1.13  outlet  pressure  —  the  pressure  at  the  outlet
fitting of the MFC (see Figure 3).
NOTE 7:  To   completely   specify   the   pressure   operating
environment  for  MFCs,  at  least  two  of  the  following  three
pressures must be listed: inlet, outlet, and differential.
4. 1.14  proof  pressure  —  the  maximum  gas  pressure
the   MFC   may   be   subjected   to   without   permanent
damage.  Some adjustment may be necessary to make it
meet   its   specified   performance   when   returning   to
normal operating pressure. (see Figure 2.)
4. 1.15  reference   ambient   —   the   composition   and
pressure  range  of  the  ambient  medium  surrounding  the
MFC  within  which  performance  specifications  apply
without requiring correction for changes in the ambient
medium.
4. 1.16  reference operating pressure, inlet and outlet —
the  range  of  gas  pressures  on  the  inlet  of  the  MFC  and
across     the     MFC     within     which     performance
specifications apply without requiring correction for gas
pressure effects (see Figure 2).
4. 1.17  standard    pressure    —    SEMI    E12    defines
standard pressure as 760 Torr (101.32 kPa) (see Figure
2).
5  Gas Pressure Effects
5. 1  Specified  Gas  —  Gas  pressure  effects  may  be  gas
species  sensitive.    The  gas  must  be  specified  when
stating  gas  pressure  effects.    Nitrogen  is  recommended
as the standard gas.
5. 2  Pressure  Measurement  Point  —  In  this  section,
pressure is assumed to be measured at the fitting of the
MFC,   inlet   or   outlet,   that   is   adjacent   to   the   flow
transducer.
5. 3  Total  Calibration  Effect  —  The  change  in  output,
including zero and span, due to a change in gas pressure
from one normal operating pressure to a second normal
operating  pressure.    All  other  conditions  must  be  held
within the limits of reference operating conditions.
5. 4  Zero  Calibration  Effect  —  the  change  in  zero  due
to  a  change  in  gas  pressure  from  one  normal  operating
pressure  to  a  second  normal  operating  pressure.    All
other  conditions  must  be  held  within  the  limits  of
reference operating conditions.
5. 4.1  The effect of gas pressure change on zero may be
expressed as a coefficient calculated as the ratio of full-
scale  percent  change  in  output  to  the  corresponding
change  in  gas  pressure.    The  change  in  gas  pressure
should  be  specified.    This  coefficient  is  defined  as  the
“pressure coefficient of zero.”
5. 4.1.1  Example — Pressure coefficient of zero may be
expressed as:

0. 2% of full scale
240 kPa  -  220 kPa

=
0. 01% of full scale/kPa with N
2

NOTE 8:  If  the  relation  between  gas  pressure  and  change  in
output is linear, one coefficient will suffice.
5. 4.2  If  the  gas  pressure  influence  is  non-linear,  a
different  method  of  expression  may  be  used.    Two
examples:
5. 4.2.1  The  percent  of  full-scale  change  in  output  will
not  exceed  a  specified  value  for  any  value  of  gas
pressure within a specified gas pressure range.
5. 4.2.1.1  Example — “± 0.15% of full-scale maximum
error over 200 kPa to 250 kPa with N
2
”
5. 4.2.2  It   may   be   desirable   to   state   a   series   of
coefficients  for  successive  increments  of  gas  pressure
within a specified gas pressure range.
5. 5  Span Calibration Effect — The change in span due
to  a  change  in  gas  pressure  from  one  normal  operating
pressure  to  a  second  normal  operating  pressure.    All
other  conditions  must  be  held  within  the  limits  of
reference operating conditions.
5. 5.1  The effect of gas pressure change on span may be
expressed  as  a  coefficient  calculated  as  the  ratio  of
percent    of    reading    change    in    output    to    the
corresponding  change  in  gas  pressure.    The  change  in
gas  pressure  should  be  specified.    This  coefficient  is
defined as the “pressure coefficient of span.”


SEMI E28-92 © SEMI 1992, 2004 4
5. 5.1.1  Example  —  Pressure  coefficient  of  span  may
be expressed as:
0. 1% of reading
240 kPa  -  220 kPa
=
0. 005% of reading/kPa with N
2

NOTE 9:  If  the  relation  between  gas  pressure  and  change  in
output is linear, one coefficient will suffice.
5. 5.2  If  the  gas  pressure  influence  is  non-linear,  a
different  method  of  expression  may  be  used.    Two
examples:
5. 5.2.1  The  percent  of  span  change  in  output  will  not
exceed  a  specified  value  for  any  value  of  gas  pressure
within a specified pressure range of a particular gas.
5. 5.2.1.1  Example  —  “±  0.1%  of  reading  maximum
error over 200 kPa to 250 kPa with Nitrogen”
5. 5.2.2  It   may   be   desirable   to   state   a   series   of
coefficients  for  successive  increments  of  gas  pressure
within a specified pressure range.

4  Requirements
4. 1    Performance   Criteria   —   The   f ollowing   are
generic   failure   criteria   for   the   various   classes   of
equipment      and      electronic      systems      used      in
semiconductor  manufacturing.  However,  any  kind  of
failure or aberration during EMC testing shall be noted
in the test report.
4. 1.1    Performance   Criteria   A   —   Th e   equipment
operates  as  intended  during  and  after  the  test.    In  the
case of process equipment, all process results are within
specifications.  No  safety  hazards  nor  false  alarms  are
present.    In  some  cases,  the  performance  level  may  be
replaced    by    a    documented    permissible    loss    of
performance  if  such  loss  is  minor  and  agreeable  to  the
concerned parties.
4. 1.2    Performance   Criteria   B   —   Th e   equipment
operates  as  intended  after  the  test,  but  experiences  a
loss  of  function  or  degradation  of  performance  during
the  test  to  a  level  specified  by  the  manufacturer.  No
change  of  operating  state  or  loss  of  stored  data  is
allowed.  Restoration  of  performance  or  function  does
not require human intervention.
4. 1.3   Performance  Criteria  C  —  Te mporary  loss  of
function  is  allowed,  provided  the  loss  of  function  is
recoverable,  either  automatically  or  through  operation
of the controls. Any failure of control or alarm systems
is   in   a   fail-safe   mode,   such   as   a   false   alarm   or
equipment shutdown.
4. 1.4  Safety Criteria — Equipment  will automatically
fail  if  testing  results  in  an  unsafe  or  potentially  unsafe
condition,  such  as  threat  to  life  or  property.  Examples
would  be  failure  of  an  emergency  machine  off  (EMO)
button to operate or faulty opening of a toxic gas valve.
4. 1.5  Conditions during Testing — A ll EMC testing is
to be done with the equipment installed and operational.
As  much  as  possible,  the  test  installation  should  be
identical to the final production installation. Substitutes
may  be  used  for  hazardous  gases  and  chemicals,  and
other modifications may be made as deemed reasonable
to ensure testing can be performed in a completely safe
and  environmentally  acceptable  manner.  Special  EMC
facilities are not required by this standard.
5  Test Methods
The  tables  below  are  organized  by  ports  to  which  the
tests   apply,   as   defined   above.   The   basic   standards
provide  the  test  setup  and  procedures  to  be  followed,
except  as  noted.  In  all  events,  EMC  testing  is  intended
to   prevent   EMC   problems   when   the   equipment   is
installed     and     operating     in     a     semiconductor
manufacturing      facility.      Any      modification      or
interpretation of the test setup and procedure should be
judged by this overriding goal.

5. 1.1  Facilities Requirements — Du e to the size and complexity of much semiconductor factory equipment, testing
in a shielded enclosure, anechoic chamber, or other special facility is not required. If such facilities can be used, the
results will be more reproducible and accurate.
Note that radiated immunity testing is required only at frequencies used for mobile communications. As shown in Table 1, Row
1. 2. Testing should be conducted in conformance with national and local emission requirements at the frequencies specified (see
Appendix D).
5. 1.2  ELF Testing — The following  sensitivity levels are defined:
Level A — ELF of less than 0.25 milliGauss rms
Level B — ELF of less than 0.50 milliGauss rms
Level C — ELF of less than 1.00 milliGauss rms
Level D — ELF of less than 2.00 milliGauss rms
Level E — ELF of 2.00 milliGauss rms and greater
ELF  sensitivity  is  to  be  determined  by  applying  ELF  through  a  coil  or  set  of  coils  designed  to  produce  a  uniform
magnetic  field  at  or  near  the  power-line  frequency  at  the  position  of  maximum  ELF  sensitivity  of  the  EUT.  The
direction of the applied field shall be set to produce the maximum disturbance to the EUT. The field level shall be
determined using a calibrated ELF meter.
If  allowable  performance  degradation  is  permitted  at  the  higher  ELF  levels,  the  performance  shall  be  specified  at
each level.

5. 2  Emissions Test
5. 2.1  EMI Testing Required — Equi pment shall be tested in accordance with CISPR 22 and EN 55 022.  Test limits
are Class A, which is generally limited to non-residential use.
As noted above for radiated immunity testing, the size and complexity of semiconductor factory equipment may rule
out the use of special facilities. Thus, the tests in CISPR 22 may be adapted as required due to test site limitations.
Again, use of such facilities will yield more reproducible and accurate data, and is recommended whenever possible.
In any event, emissions greater than 6 dB above the Class A limits are not allowed.
5. 2.2  ELF  Testing  Required  —  ELF  emission  testing  is  required  for  all  ELF-sensitive  equipment,  since  such
equipment is commonly grouped together. ELF emission testing for other types of equipment is required on request
of a purchaser intending installation of ELF-sensitive equipment in the immediate vicinity.

SEMI E33-94 © SEMI 1994, 19965
ELF  emissions  shall  be  measured  using  a  calibrated
ELF meter. Equipment emissions shall be measured at a
distance  of  1.5  meters  from  the  entire  perimeter  of  the
EUT  at  a  height  of  1  meter.  Facility  ELF  shall  be
measured  at  a  height  of  1  meter  in  the  region  where
ELF-sensitive    equipment    installation    is    intended.
Measurement  points  shall  be  no  greater  than  0.5  meter
apart in the regions specified above. Facilities electrical
systems  and  adjacent  equipment  should  be  in  normal
operation  to  assure  accurate  measurement  of  the  actual
operating environment.
At  each  measurement  point,  the  ELF  sensor  should  be
oriented   to   produce   the   maximum   reading.   The
maximum from all the measurement points is then used
to determine the level from the table below:
Level A — ELF of less than 0.25 milliGauss rms
Level B — ELF of less than 0.50 milliGauss rms
Level C — ELF of less than 1.00 milliGauss rms
Level D — ELF of less than 2.00 milliGauss rms
Level E — ELF of 2.00 milliGauss rms and greater
6  Equipment Installation an d Grounding
Special installation, power, and grounding requirements
necessary  to  meet  this  standard  shall  be  thoroughly
documented     by     the     equipment     supplier.     FIPS
Publication   94   and   the   IEEE   Emerald   Book   are
suggested   sources   of   information   for   recommended
practices in this area.
Removable   shielded   panels   or   doors   that   must   be
properly secured to meet this standard should be labeled
“SECURE       THIS       PANEL       TO       REDUCE
ELECTROMAGNETIC  EMISSIONS.”  This  labeling
requirement  is  not  applicable  to  interlocked  panels  that
must be in place for the equipment to operate.
7  Documentation
Upon request of the purchaser a report of the test results
against  this  standard  shall  be  furnished.  Similarly,  the
supplier   may   use   this   standard   as   a   reference   in
specifying     the     environmental     requirements     of
equipment.
8  Alternate Testing
Testing  completed  under  a  different,  but  substantially
similar   standard   may   be   substituted   for   the   basic
standards  specified  herein  if  the  performance  criteria
and   test   levels   are   similar   to   those   above.   Such
substitution  shall  be  noted  in  the  test  report,  and  must
be   agreed   to   by   the   concerned   parties.   Examples
include  substitution  of  ANSI  C63.4-1991  testing  for
CISPR 22.
Similarly,   equipment   which   satisfies   the   European
EMC  Directive  and  bears  the  CE  mark  meets  this
specification.

APPENDICES
The appendices are not an official part of this standard.
However,    they    contain    relevant    information    for
customizing    the    basic    standards    for    testing    of
semiconductor  equipment  and  facilities,  and  point  out
areas of concern for which no standard currently exists.
A.1  Appendix A:  Charged Wafer Testing
Due  to  overriding  microcontamination  concerns,  non-
static-dissipative  wafer  carriers  must  be  used  during
semiconductor   fabrication.   It   is   suggested   that   any
equipment  which  handles  wafers  be  tested  with  wafers
charged  to  18  kV/in.  The  charge  generator  used  for
801-2  testing  can  be  used  to  charge  the  wafer.  Some
experimentation  will  be  required  to  determine  the  best
means  to  carry  out  this  test.  Alternately,  the  handling
mechanism   may   be   challenged   by   air   or   contact
discharge directed to the mechanism.
It  is  suggested  that  wafer  handlers  be  designed  to
dissipate  charge  on  incoming  wafers  in  a  controlled,
non-sparking   manner.   A   simple   AM   radio   tuned
between  stations  and  placed  near  the  handler  has  been
found to be a good qualitative means to detect sparking.
Sparking  will  result  in  pops  and  static  being  heard  on
the radio.
A.2  Appendix B:  ESD Test Methods
Although  the  contact  method  of  ESD  testing  has  been
found   to   be   much   more   reproducible   than   the   air
discharge,   the   air   discharge   is   a   more   realistic
simulation  of  possible  events  that  can  occur  in  the
semiconductor  factory.  Also,  the  air  discharge  method
is the only realistic way to test objects that are primarily
fabricated  from  insulators,  such  as  wet  stations  and
keyboards.
In addition to testing surfaces that come in contact with
humans  and  wafers,  it  is  important  to  test  any  area  of
the   equipment   that   can   be   exposed   to   ESD.   For
instance,   wet   stations   are   composed   of   assemblies
involving  large  masses  of  insulators  in  proximity  to
metallic  sensors  and  controllers.  It  is  possible  for  the
insulating   surfaces   to   build   up   charge,   which   then
sparks  to  a  sensor  or  controller  —  all  internal  to  the
equipment itself.
A.3  Appendix C:  Future Directions
Items   in   this   section   are   not   requirements   of   this
standard,  but  are  included  to  indicate  currently  ill-
defined      goals      for      further      improvements      to
semiconductor factory EMC.
A.3.1    Static  Charge  —  Minimization  of  static  charge
promotes cleanliness, and avoids damage to material in
process and reticles.
It  is  suggested  that  electrostatic  fields  be  held  to  under
200  V/cm  (500  V/in).  This  would  be  applicable  to
personnel,  wafers,  cassettes,  cassette  boxes,  reticles,
reticle boxes, and all equipment and facility surfaces in
proximity to these items as well as all surfaces exposed
to filtered airflow. Measurements shall be made using a
properly-grounded     electrostatic     field     meter     in
accordance with its manufacturer's instructions.
A.4  Appendix D:  National Requirements
A.4.1  U.S. — Section 5.1.1 Table 1, row 1.2: Radiated
immunity testing outside a shielded enclosure is legally
accomplished   by   obtaining   an   experimental   license
from   the   FCC   using   FCC   form   442.   The   FCC
recommends   using   techniques   such   as   scanning   or
hopping to avoid interference.
A.4.2  Europe — The earth port: Refer to Table 1.6 of
the   informative   annex   to   EN   50   082-2   for   test
requirements applicable to the earth.

GUIDELINE FOR MASS FLOW DEVICE RETURN
NOTICE:  This  safety  guideline  does  not  purport  to
address all of the safety issues associated with its use. It
is  the  responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  guideline  to
establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and
determine  the  applicability  of  regulatory  limitations
prior to use.
1  Purpose
Mass  flow  devices  (mass  flow  controllers,  mass  flow
meters and flow control valves) are used as an integral
part  of  the  chemical  delivery  system  in  semiconductor
processing  equipment.  Many  of  the  chemicals  used  in
semiconductor     processes     can     be     hazardous     to
equipment   and   personnel.   Once   exposed   to   these
chemicals,  the  contaminated  mass  flow  devices  can
present  a  hazard  to  repair  personnel  and  equipment  if
not handled properly.
Implementing  the  procedures  outlined  in  this  guideline
provide a mechanism to reduce the risk associated with
shipping  and/or  receiving  any  potentially  hazardous
mass  flow  device  used  to  monitor  or  control  gases  or
liquids.
2  Scope
This guideline is intended to:
Recommend and encourage the purging of devices used
with hazardous materials prior to removal to reduce the
risk of handling them.
Alert  the  recipient  of  possibly  hazardous  mass  flow
devices to the nature of the hazard.
Establish   mechanism   for   properly   identifying   and
documenting  possibly  hazardous  mass  flow  devices  by
using  an  orange  tag  and  a  health  and  safety  disclosure
form.

valve,  and  control-  and  signal-processing  electronics,
commonly   used   in   the   semiconductor   industry   to
measure and regulate the mass flow of gas.
4. 3  mass flow meter (mfm) — A se lf-contained device,
consisting   of   a   mass   flow   transducer   and   signal-
processing    electronics,    commonly    used    in    the
semiconductor  industry  to  measure  the  mass  flow  of
gas.
4. 4   material  safety  data  sheet  (msd s)  —  Written  or
printed material concerning a hazardous material which
is  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  29
CFR 1910.1200.
4. 5   protective  container  —  A  seal able  plastic  bag  or
other  container  which  will  keep  hazardous  material
from  the  mass  flow  device  from  contaminating  the
outer  package.  The  container  should  be  transparent,  if
possible.
4. 6  purge — To dilute potentially  harmful material in
the  mass  flow  device  by  flowing  an  inert  gas  through
the device. Purging a chemical delivery line containing
a  mass  flow  device  with  an  inert  substance  is  intended
to dilute hazardous materials and reduce the level of the
hazard. To be effective, the inert substance must be able
to  reach  all  points  within  the  chemical  delivery  system
in sufficient quantity to dilute the hazardous material to
safe  levels.  The  nature  of  the  hazard  and  the  physical
configuration  of  the  chemical  delivery  system  must  be
considered when developing a purge procedure.
4. 7    safe   —   Free   of   conditions   that    can   cause
occupational  illness,  injury,  or  death  to  personnel  or
damage  to  or  loss  of  equipment  or  property  or  the
environment.

GUIDE TO CALCULATE COST OF OWNERSHIP (COO) METRICS FOR
SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT
This guide was technically approved by the Global Metrics Committee and is the direct responsibility of the
North  American  Metrics  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  North  American  Regional  Standards
Committee  on  December  10,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  February  2005;  to  be  published
March 2005.  Originally published in 1995; previously published March 2004.
NOTICE: This document was completely rewritten in 2005.
1  Purpose
1. 1  The  purpose  of  this  guide  is  to  provide  standard  metrics  for  evaluating  unit  production  cost  effectiveness  of
manufacturing equipment in the semiconductor industry.
1. 2  This  guide  establishes  a  well-defined  procedure  to  facilitate  an  understanding  of  equipment-related  costs  by
providing definitions, classifications, algorithms, methods, and default values necessary to build a full or constrained
cost of ownership (COO) calculator.
NOTE 1:  Related Information 1 provides a graphical representation of calculating COO to expand upon the guide text.
2  Scope
2. 1  This  guide  is  applicable  to  any  type  of  equipment  for  processing  semiconductor  units,  which  may  be  wafers,
devices, flat panels or other material.  Some terms are specialized to integrated circuit wafer and device production.
2. 2  Effective use of the metric to build a COO model requires identification of constraints and data values.  Where
possible, use direct values for inputs rather than deriving them from secondary models or using example values.
NOTE 2:  Related Information 2 provides some example data.
2. 3  Full calculation of COO often requires data held proprietary and is coupled to the overall factory yield and the
related  cost  of  yield  loss.    It  is  envisioned  that  this  guide  will  be  used  for  internal  factory  and  equipment
optimization, investment evaluation, and equipment design improvements.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  Certain cost factors are more difficult than others to accurately determine.  Figure 1 depicts the relationship of
some  of  the  COO  model  input  factors  to  ability  to  collect  and  validate  them.    The  accuracy  of  a  COO  calculation
may be prone to a variety of errors or omissions.
3. 2  Line  balance  considerations  are  not  included  in  the  COO  calculation.    Line  balance  considerations  are  not
included because it is difficult, in an individual COO model, to show the impact of equipment being modeled on the
complete manufacturing facility.  A factory-level cost model should be used for this purpose.
3. 3  A  COO  calculation  may  have  more  detail  than  presented  explicitly  in  this  guide.    The  structure  of  the  guide,
however, allows for these situations.

5. 1.12  TP — Throughput
5. 2  Definitions
5. 2.1  alpha error — the error that occurs when a conforming item is incorrectly reported as nonconforming.  This is
also called Type I error.
5. 2.2  alpha probability,
α — the probability of an alpha error, also called the alpha error rate.
5. 2.3  baseline cost of ownership — a constrained version of cost of ownership (COO) that only includes equipment
yield [i.e., defect limited yield and parametric limited yield are not included].
5. 2.4  beta error — the error that occurs when a nonconforming item is incorrectly reported as conforming.  This is
also called Type II error.
5. 2.5  beta probability,
β — the probability of a beta error, also called the beta error rate.
5. 2.6  bias,
δ — the difference between the mean value of measurements made on the same object and a true value.
NOTE 3:  In many cases the true value of bias is unknown.  A value established by reference gauges or a consensus value may be
used as a substitute.
5. 2.7  comprehensive cost of ownership — cost of ownership (COO) calculated with no constraints.
5. 2.8  constrained  cost  of  ownership  —  cost  of  ownership  (COO)  version  with  a  set  of  defined  restrictions  to
facilitate comparisons or to remove ambiguity.
5. 2.9  consumable  —  part  of  the  piece  of  equipment  that  is  worn  out  by  the  process  operation  of  the  piece  of
equipment and requires replacement after less than one year of operation.
5. 2.10  cost  footprint  —  the  area  (A)  of  the  smallest  horizontal  rectangle  that  contains  all  of  the  shadow  footprint
and half of the easement space around the piece of equipment.  This is calculated as:

()
[]
()
[]
DeDsDeWeWsWtA−+×−+=2/12/1                                                          (1)
()()
DsDeWsWe+×+=4/1

where:
De = Depth of the piece of equipment
Ds = Combined depth of the piece of equipment and easement space
We = Width of the piece of equipment
Ws = Combined width of the piece of equipment and easement space
5. 2.11  cost  of  equipment  ownership  (CEO)  —  a  factor  in  cost  of  ownership  that  includes  all  costs  not  associated

environment equipment needed to accommodate the required volume of production units.
5. 2.13  cost of yield loss (CYL) — a unit lost at the end of a given step represents the loss of the cost of the starting
unit and the manufacturing to that point.  In addition, units leaving a step may be lost at some later step.  Calculating
CYL therefore requires knowing the starting unit cost and the accumulated cost of manufacturing before the unit is
lost.  Therefore, CYL should be tracked as a separate cost for factory optimization.
5. 2.14  cumulative  distribution  function  (CDF)  —  a  mathematical  formula  that  describes  the  probability  a
measurable event occurs at or below a specific value.
5. 2.15  default or default  value  —  a  value  to  be  used  if  actual  data  are  not  available.    Also  called  example  value.
Where possible, actual data should be used in COO calculations.

5. 2.17  distribution  —  a  characterization  of  the  probability  of  realization  for  a  measurable  event  over  the  range  of
values that the measurements may assume.
5. 2.18  easement space — the floor space that must remain clear to the rear and sides of the piece of equipment (but
not  in  front  of  the  load  face  plane).    This  includes  safety  aisles,  ergonomic  maintenance  access  space,  component

5. 2.21  equipment yield (EY) — the fraction of units received by the equipment that can be passed to the next step
based on any criteria such as damaged units, or units determined to be defective by inspection or test.  Inclusion of
equipment  yield  results  in  a  decreasing  population  of  units  flowing  through  the  factory.    At  later  steps,  equipment
will process fewer units than the full factory unit starts.  For test equipment, validly rejected units are scrap, but not
a component of equipment yield.
5. 2.22  fixed costs — costs incurred once and usually associated with the acquisition and incorporation of a piece of
equipment into the factory.
5. 2.23  good  unit  equivalents  (GUE)  —  the  calculated  number  of  equivalent  units  required  to  produce  the  same
number of units output if product yield was 100%.

units consumed in the support of the piece of equipment.
5. 2.28  measurand — particular attribute of a phenomenon, body, or substance subject to measurement [VIM].
5. 2.29  measurement   variability   —   differences   associated   with   making   multiple   measurements   on   a   given
measurand under specific conditions.
NOTE 4:  Common   (general)   estimators   of   measurement   variability   are   the   variance,   standard   deviation,   and   variance
components.  Specific estimators include repeatability and reproducibility.
5. 2.30  monitor unit — test or filler unit (e.g., wafer or device) consumed in the support of the piece of equipment.
Also called test unit.
5. 2.31  operational  uptime  (OU)  —  the  percentage  of  time  the  piece  of  equipment  is  in  a  condition  to  perform  its

Accumulation of Cost during Factory Flow

6. 1  Description of COO
6. 1.1  COO is a metric for evaluating the incremental cost added to a unit of good product material flowing through
equipment embedded in a factory environment for a specified lifetime, including the CYL.  COO is calculated on an
annualized  basis.    The  metric  is  expressed  as  cost  per  good  unit  for  one  pass  through  the  equipment.    Figure  2
depicts this accumulation of cost which can be factored into two components, CEO and CYL, as shown in Equation

# 3

3.
6. 1.2  COO  is  the  full  cost  of  embedding,  operating,  and  decommissioning  in  a  factory  environment  equipment
needed to accommodate the required volume of product material.
6. 1.2.1  COO calculated with no constraints is referred to as comprehensive COO.
6. 2  Constrained Versions of COO
6. 2.1  A  constrained  version  of  COO  imposes  a  set  of  defined  restrictions  to  facilitate  comparisons  or  to  remove
ambiguity.  An example is a baseline COO that only includes EY (i.e., DLY and PLY are not included.
6. 2.2  Constraints should be predefined by all stakeholders in a specific equipment COO model, prior to estimating
COO, to minimize biasing of the COO estimate.
6. 3  Lifetimes
6. 3.1  The lifetime of a piece of equipment is the time over which the fixed and recurring costs are considered for
evaluating  the  annualized  COO.    The  number  of  years  that  a  piece  of  equipment  is  planned  to  be  used  in
manufacturing is the piece of equipment’s production lifetime.


SEMI E35-0305 © SEMI 1995, 2005 7
6. 3.2  Tax lifetime for depreciation allocation purposes is another measure of the piece of equipment’s lifetime that
is customarily used in evaluating COO.  Tax lifetime is based upon local tax or standard accounting practices.
6. 3.3  The  piece  of  equipment  usually  remains  in  production  much  longer  than  the  tax  lifetime,  so  it  is  useful  to
consider both lifetimes in evaluating COO.
6. 4  CEO: Fixed and Recurring Costs
6. 4.1  Determining CEO requires enumerating all of the fixed and recurring costs that are incurred in the life cycle
of the piece of equipment.  The calculation is shown in §8.
6. 4.2  Fixed  costs  are  those  incurred  once  and  are  usually  associated  with  the  acquisition  and  incorporation  of  a
piece of equipment into the factory.  End-of-life costs, such as decontamination and removal costs, are also part of
fixed costs.
6. 4.3  Recurring  costs  are  those  that  arise  on  a  regular  basis  from  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  piece  of
equipment.    Some  infrequent  recurring  costs,  including  the  costs  of  upgrading  a  piece  of  equipment  to  new
technologies may be included in fixed costs if the CEO is being calculated to compare an upgraded existing piece of
equipment with a new acquisition.
6. 4.3.1  Costs that are depreciated should be included as fixed costs.
6. 5  Yield
6. 5.1  Yield is a metric of the percentage of the unit volume that results in good product.  Yield affects the COO in a
number of ways.
• Volume of units that must be processed for the required product requirements.
• Cost of units that do not produce good product.
6. 5.2  Product  yield  (PRY)  is  the  percentage  of  units  that  pass  through  the  factory  and  result  in  good  product.
Product  yield  for  units  is  the  composite  yield  from  all  sources  of  yield  loss,  as  shown  in  Equation  4.    The
components are defined in §5.

6. 5.2.1  Since DLY is generally a wafer-level phenomena, Equation 4 may be simplified for other types of units by
setting DLY = 1.  Particle additions are a predictor of defect yield loss at a future step, but not a complete predictor
of all the possible loss since there may be other defects or parametric problems.
6. 5.2.2  The P/T ratio of test and measurement equipment also affects PRY.  P/T ratio is reflected in Equation 4 by
the inclusion of α and β.  The formulas for calculating α and β are provided in Appendix 1.
6. 6  Cost of Yields
6. 6.1  A unit lost at the end of a given step represents the loss of the starting unit cost and all costs of manufacturing
a  unit  prior  to  that  step.    In  addition,  units  leaving  a  step  with  undetected  defects  may  be  lost  at  a  later  step.
Calculating  CYL  therefore  requires  knowing  the  accumulated  costs  of  manufacturing  before  the  unit  is  lost.
Therefore, although CYL is a recurring cost, it should be tracked separately.  CYL is given in Equation 7 in ¶8.2.
6. 7  Volume Requirement
6. 7.1  The volume requirement is the number of units to be processed and can be derived from specification of the
product units needed corrected for yield and the number of other units required to be processed by the equipment in
a  specific  time  period  such  as  rework  or  monitor  units.    One  complication  in  accurately  estimating  the  volume
requirement is that the volume of units actually reaching the equipment will depend on the equipment yields from all
prior steps.
6. 8  Equipment Required
6. 8.1 Once the volume of units is specified, the number of pieces of equipment required (ER) is obtained from the
TP and the OU.
ER = Volume Requirement / (TP × OU) (5)


SEMI E35-0305 © SEMI 1995, 2005 8
For  CEO  calculations,  ER  is  a  whole  number.    Thus,  a  fractional  result  from  Equation  5  is  increased  to  the  next
larger whole number to represent whole pieces of equipment.
7  Reporting Results

8  Procedures
8. 1  COO Calculation
8. 1.1  The  COO  algorithm  requires  the  specification  or  calculation  of  the  volume  level,  the  determination  of  the
number  of  pieces  of  equipment  required  to  process  the  volume,  the  enumeration  of  all  fixed  and  recurring  costs
associated with processing the volume by the equipment, and the yield-related costs.  The COO metric is a function
defined by Equation 6 to be:
COO = CEO + CYL (6)
The CYL is given by Equation 7.  The CEO component is described in Equation 8 and is expressed in Equation 9 as
the  sum  of  a  number  of  cost  categories.    Constrained  versions  of  COO  exclude  certain  cost  categories  from  the
calculation.

APPENDIX 1
METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING ALPHA AND BETA ERRORS
NOTICE:    The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E35  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot
procedures on December 10, 2004.
A1-1  Purpose
A1-1.1  In  silicon  manufacturing  product  disposition  is  typically  contingent  on  metrology  equipment  output.    For
example,  a  unit  may  be  shipped,  scrapped,  or  reworked  based  on  information  from  one  or  more  measured  output
characteristics.
A1-1.2  This  appendix  provides  a  standard  methodology  to  include  the  cost  due  to  misclassification  of  product
because of measurement variability and bias during testing of the product for conformance to a specification.
A1-1.3  This appendix is also intended to be useful for pre-purchase evaluation of pieces of measurement equipment
with  different  P/T  ratios.    It  is  also  intended  to  be  useful  when  comparing  the  operation  of  a  single  measurement
instrument  in  different  throughput  modes  where  P/T  ratio  changes  with  the  throughput  mode  utilized  or  other
equipment  setup  factors.    This  appendix  can  help  users  select  the  optimum  cost  solution  based  on  their  specific
process capability and requirements.
A1-2  Scope
A1-2.1  This  appendix  covers  a  methodology  to  determine  the  alpha  and  beta  probabilities  associated  with
misclassification  of  product  due  to  variability  and  bias  of  measurement  equipment.    Alpha  probability  (α)  is
associated with failing units that conform to specifications.  Beta probability (β) is associated with passing units that
do not conform to specifications.
A1-2.2  This appendix can be applied to make relative misclassification cost comparisons as part of a COO analysis
between two or more measurement gauges operating under conditions specified by the user.  These conditions may
include  any  aspects  of  the  measurement  system  affecting  the  measurement  results  directly  or  indirectly  (e.g.,
ambient  conditions,  throughput,  recipe).    This  appendix  can  also  be  used  to  compare  the  relative  costs  of  a  single
instrument under different operating conditions.
A1-2.2.1  A  measurement  gauge  is  defined  by  a  specific  realization  of  systems  and  subsystems  required  to  make
measurements.  Gauges that differ in at least one system or subsystem may be considered different for the purpose
of comparison.
A1-2.3  This appendix can be applied to any piece of metrology equipment or to the metrology portion of any piece
of equipment that includes metrology.
A1-2.4  This appendix covers the case in which the piece of metrology equipment is used to make binary decisions
about  the  item  being  measured,  that  is,  only  two  outcomes  are  possible  (e.g.,  pass/fail,  go/no-go,  ship/scrap).
Models  for  decisions  with  more  than  two  outcomes,  such  as  the  binning  of  data,  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this
Appendix.
A1-2.5  To apply the formulae in this appendix, the user must estimate either the probability density function (PDF)
or  cumulative  distribution  function  (CDF)  of  the  process  characteristic  or  characteristics  of  interest.    The
distributions can be based on a theoretical model or on empirical information obtained from manufacturing data.
A1-2.6  To apply the formulae in this appendix, the user must be able to estimate all biases and variances associated
with the piece of equipment being compared under the specified operating conditions and with respect to the process
characteristic(s) of interest.  These values can be obtained from a measurement system capability analysis (see SEMI
E89).
A1-2.7  This  appendix  does  not  consider  costs  associated  with  other  components  of  uncertainty  outside  of
measurement variability and bias.


SEMI E35-0305 © SEMI 1995, 2005 13
A1-3  Limitations
A1-3.1  Application  of  this  appendix  requires  that  all  measurement  variances,  biases,  and  process  characteristic
distributions be accurately characterized.  If this is not done, the resulting calculation may be in error.
A1-3.2  Application  of  this  appendix  also  requires  that  measurement  variances  and  biases  be  constant  over  the
measurement range interval of interest.  If this is not the case, the resulting calculation may be in error.
A1-3.3  This appendix considers only the case of two convolved distributions, process characteristic variability and
measurement  variability;  consideration  of  additional  distributions  (such  as  would  be  required  if  the  measurement
bias or variance were assumed to be a function of the measured value) is beyond the scope of this appendix.
A1-3.4  Extension  of  the  model  to  the  cases  of  decisions  based  on  (1)  measurements  on  multiple  gauges,  (2)
multiple inspections with the same gauge, or (3) on multiple characteristics is provided in §A1-5.
A1-4  Procedure
A1-4.1  Estimate  the  PDF  for  the  process  characteristic  to  be  studied.    This  can  be  done  using  empirical  data  that
represents the process.  Although actual data may be used to create a discrete PDF, it is sometimes convenient to use
the data to parametrically fit a PDF model (e.g., log normal).
A1-4.2  Unless  already  known,  establish  the  bias  and  standard  deviation  for  each  measurement  gauge  to  be
compared in accordance with SEMI E89.
A1-4.3  In all cases take the measurement influence into account so that it does not broaden the PDF.  This may be
done  by  taking  repeated  measurements  at  each  point  in  the  measurement  range  and  calculating  the  mean,  or  by
deconvolving the process characteristic PDF, f(x), and the measurement variability CDF, G(u), generally assumed to
be a Gaussian (or normal) distribution with arithmetic mean equal to the bias, so that:

A1-5  Extensions of the Methodology to More Complex Situations
A1-5.1  In general, when a single characteristic on a unit is measured once on a single gauge and 100% sampling is
employed, the model will take the form described earlier.  If the situation is more complex, the nature of the model
will be different.  Factors that can affect the nature of the model include the following:
• number of units examined (lot acceptance sampling vs.  100% sampling),
• number of times a unit is inspected (single vs.  multiple),
• effect of the inspection process on the unit (destructive vs.  non-destructive),
• number of item characteristics examined for a single decision (one vs.  many), and
• cost functions associated with the business decisions (fixed vs.  variable).
A1-5.2  Extension to Multiple Gauges
A1-5.2.1  To  extend  the  model  to  multiple  gauges,  one  must  make  the  additional  assumption  that  all  measuring
gauges are measuring the same characteristic.
A1-5.2.1.1  In  addition,  define  a  conforming  item  as  one  that  all  gauges  show  the  measured  characteristic  to  be  in
specification.
A1-5.2.1.2  A nonconforming item is taken to be one in which at least one gauge shows the measured characteristic
to be outside of specification.
A1-5.2.2  It is then possible to define a set of
α and β error rates for each gauge.  Let α
1
, α
2
, ..., α
n
be the α values
and
β

NOTE 2:  This equation is based on the probability P that the item is conforming but that one or more gauges give a conforming
result:

A1-5.3  Extension to Multiple Inspections with the Same Metrology System
A1-5.3.1  Multiple inspection with the same metrology system is a special case of inspection with multiple gauges.
If the same measurement system is used to measure the item characteristic repeatedly, one merely lets
α
i
= α and β
i

=
β for all i, as the α and β error rates will not change for the same gauge.
A1-5.4  Extension to Decisions Based on Multiple Characteristics
A1-5.4.1  It is also possible to develop a model where a decision is based on more than one characteristic.  As with
the case of multiple gauges, several assumptions must be made.
A1-5.4.1.1  The  characteristics  being  measured  are  independent  or  an  independent  combination  of  their  values  is
used.
A1-5.4.1.2  All tests are performed before a decision to reject or pass is made.
A1-5.4.1.3  F(x) has been deconvolved from F·G.
A1-5.4.1.4  A  conforming  unit  is  defined  as  one  in  which  all  measured  characteristics  are  shown  to  be  within
specification.
A1-5.4.1.5  A nonconforming unit is taken to be one in which at least one characteristic is outside of specification.
A1-5.4.2  It is then possible to define a set of
α and β errors for each gauge.  Let α
1
, α
2
, ..., α
n
be the α values and
β
1
, β
2
, ..., β
n
be the β values associated with the n different characteristics.

α value, α
T

This equation is based on the probability P that all characteristics conform, but that at least one test failed:
α
T

P[All characteristics conform]
–
P[All characteristics conform, All tests passed]

R1-1.1  A  discussion  of  COO  is  provided  in  this  related  information  to  supplement  the  presentation  within  the
guideline.
R1-1.2  The  COO  calculation  is  shown  graphically  in  Figure  R1-1.    This  figure  is  not  a  flowchart,  but  rather  is
meant to illustrate the elements of the calculation.
R1-1.3  The left side of the diagram shows various cost factors, while the right side shows how they are incorporated
in the calculation.  The upper section is the determination of the number of pieces of equipment required to process
the specified number of units.  In the middle section, the fixed costs are converted to an annual basis and combined
with the recurring costs.  In the last section, the total cost is then divided by the number of good unit equivalents.
