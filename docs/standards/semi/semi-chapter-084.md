SEMI F67-1101 © SEMI 20011 SEMI F67-1101TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING INERT GAS PURIFIER CAPACITY This test method was technically approved by the Global Facilities Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Facilities Committee. Current edition approved by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on August 27, 2001. Initially available at www.semi.org September 2001; to bepublished November 2001. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this document is to define a testmethod to quantify impurity removal capacity of inertgas purifiers. 2 Scope2.1 To determine the impurity capacity of a gas purifierat the point of breakthrough. Capacity tests are done byadding ppm levels of a given gaseous impurity to a purezero gas and monitoring the effluent of the test purifierfor active impurity species.NOTE 1: Mixtures of two or more impurities for multiimpurity removal purifiers is a more representative methodfor determining capacity.2.2 This document is intended for point of use (POU)inert gas purifiers where inlet purity is 99.9995% orhigher.2.3 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate and safety health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 The inherent limitation to this method is the limitof detection (LOD) of the analytical instrumentemployed by the user.3.2 This test method can only be used to comparepurifier capacity results if the user application for flowrate, pressure, and temperature are the same as the testconditions. Different users and/or different operatingconditions may result in different purifier performanceresults.3.3 In testing mixtures of impurities, some impuritiesmay influence the capacity results. Discussion with themanufacturer is highly recommended prior to testing.3.4 The test method does not apply to particulates.3.5 This test method can only be used to compare thecapacity of different purifiers, when the purifiers aresized for the appropriate flow rate. Comparing purifiersof different maximum flow ratings will result inmisleading information. 3.6 This test method will provide capacity informationonly for impurities that are used in the challenge gas. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E29  Standard Terminology for the Calibrationof Mass Flow Controllers and Mass Flow MetersSEMI F6  Guide for Secondary Containment ofHazardous Gas Piping SystemsSEMI F22  Guide for Gas Distribution SystemsSEMI F33  Method for Calibration of AtmosphericPressure Ionization Mass Spectrometer (APIMS)4.2 ANSI Standards1 ANSI B46.1  Surface Texture (Surface Roughness,Waviness, and Lay)NOTE 2: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents citedshall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms5.1.1 APIMS  atmospheric pressure ionization massspectrometer5.1.2 °C  degrees Celsius5.1.3 DUT  device under test5.1.4 °F  degrees Fahrenheit5.1.5 in  inch5.1.6 kPa  kiloPascal5.1.7 LOD  limit of detection5.1.8 m  meter5.1.9 MFC  mass flow controller5.1.10 NMHC  non methane hydrocarbons5.1.11 POU  point of use5.1.12 ppb  parts per billion, volume basis 1 American National Standards Institute, New York Office: 11 West42nd Street, New York, NY 10036, USA.

The test method does notpurport to address the safety considerations associatedwith its use. It is the responsibility of the user toestablish appropriate safety and health practices anddetermine the applicability of regulatory limitationsbefore using this method.7.2 Exhaust from the DUT should be properly vented.7.3 Only the appropriate gas should be used for purifiertesting. Use of the inappropriate gas may causeexothermic reactions and possible explosions.7.4 Electric discharges or mechanical friction mighttrigger combustion within a getter. Avoid situationswhere there is an accumulation of electrostatic charge.7.5 Purifiers are generally designed for use withimpurity levels less than 1% and should not be used topurify air or other inappropriate gases. Contact themanufacturer if there is any question as to thesuitability for a particular gas.7.6 Care should be taken to minimize the purifiersexposure to room air (even filtered air). Room air maychemically react with some purifiers shortening thepurifier lifetime. Follow manufacturers installationprocedures. 8 Test Protocol8.1 Test Conditions8.1.1 The test should be conducted followingmanufacturers recommended handling procedures toactivate new media or regenerate existing purifiermedia.8.1.2 The test is to be conducted at a room temperaturemaintained between 18°C (64°F) and 26°C (78°F).Environmental temperature fluctuations within thisrange are not expected to have any measurable effect onthe instrumentation used to detect the level of impurities. Follow instrument manufacturers operatingprocedures.8.1.3 Testing performed at high impurity challengemay alter test results, and may not be appropriate to dofor all types of purifiers. Any significant temperaturechange during the test could have adverse or falseeffects on the capacity results.8.1.4 For a mixture of more than 1 impurity, competingreactions may occur between impurities, which maylead to different results.8.2 Apparatus8.2.1 Materials8.2.1.1 Test Gas  a mixture of pure gas andchallenge gas. Select the appropriate concentrationlevel. For initial studies, a higher concentration range,e.g., 500 ppm to 1% is suggested for each givenimpurity. For more representative studies done overlonger time periods, 110 ppm for each given impurityis suggested.8.2.1.2 Pressure Regulators  all wetted internalsurfaces, where appropriate, should be made ofelectropolished 316L stainless steel with an internalsurface finish of 0.18 m (7 in) Ra and 0.25 m (10in) Ra,max, to control system pressures.8.2.1.3 Pressure Gauge  all wetted internal surfaces,where appropriate, should be made of electropolished316L stainless steel with an internal surface finish of0.18 m (7 in) Ra and 0.25 m (10 in) Ra,max, tomonitor system pressures.8.2.1.4 Standard Test Flows  use appropriate massflow devices. One MFC with appropriate range of 050slpm for the pure gas is suggested. Various MFCs withappropriate ranges of 025 sccm, 0100 sccm and 01slpm for the challenge gas is suggested.8.2.1.5 Tubing  made of electropolished 316Lstainless steel, with an internal surface finish of 0.18m (7 in) Ra and 0.25 m (10 in) Ra,max, to transportgas.8.2.1.6 Fittings  the appropriate size face-seal fittingis used.8.2.1.7 Gaskets  use metal gaskets for allconnections. New gaskets should be used for each newconnection.

SEMI F69-0302 © SEMI 20021 SEMI F69-0302TEST METHODS FOR TRANSPORT AND SHOCK TESTING OF GASDELIVERY SYSTEMS This test method was technically approved by the Global Facilities Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Facilities Committee. Current edition approved by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on November 27, 2001. Initially available at www.semi.org December 2001; to bepublished March 2002. 1 Purpose1.1 This document provides test methods for qualifyingthe mechanical integrity of gas delivery systemsthrough vibration and shock testing. 2 Scope2.1 The test methods recommended herein provide forvibration (transport simulation) and shock testing of gasdelivery systems for semiconductor processing.2.2 The test methods recommended herein apply to gasdelivery systems not crated or packaged for shipment.Specifically, the test methods are to be applied to theassembled and interconnected gas delivery componentsand their associated mounting panel (back plane), withor without a sheet metal enclosure.2.3 For the purpose of this guideline, transportationvibration, and its simulation, are expectedly moresevere than in-use vibrational levels. Thus thetransportation simulation test is considered acceptableto assess mechanical integrity adequate for bothshipment and life-cycle vibrational stress of the gasdelivery systems.2.4 The intent of the shock test is to provide furtherassessment of equipment malfunction that may resultfrom shocks experienced during unpacking, installation,or use in the field.2.5 Successful completion of the tests recommendedherein is a recommended metric of mechanical integrityfor gas delivery systems architecture, design, andassembly techniques.2.6 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This document, as a guide, does not providedetailed information sufficient for conducting the tests.It is the responsibility of the user and testing entity toprocure a copy of the referenced test procedures fromthe issuing organization(s). 3.2 The test methods recommended herein are intendedto evaluate gas delivery systems architectures, designprinciples, and assembly methodologies, not individualproduction gas delivery systems.3.3 The functional components of gas deliverysystems, for example mass flow controllers andpressure transducers, may be adversely affected by theforces seen during these tests. Such components mayrequire recalibration after testing. 4 Referenced StandardsNOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall bethe latest publications of adopted standards.4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI F1  Specification for Leak Integrity of High-Purity Gas Piping Systems and Components4.2 Military Standards1 MIL-STD-810  Environmental EngineeringConsiderations and Laboratory Tests 5 Terminology5.1 bag leak test  A helium leak testing procedure inwhich the system undergoing leak test is placed in ahelium-filled plastic bag while connected to afunctional helium leak detector.5.2 g  A unit of force equal to that exerted by gravityupon a mass in equilibrium on the earths surface.Expressed in Newtons (kg-m/sec. 2).5.3 leak tight  Having a helium leak rate no greaterthan that specified by the customer or end-user. 6 Vibration TestingNOTE 2: Vibration testing should be performed in its entiretybefore continuing to the shock testing.6.1 In general, conduct vibrational testing according toMIL-STD-810, Part Two, Laboratory Test Method514.5, Procedure 1, Category 4, for 3 hours in each axis(a total of 9 hours).

Because vibration tablesare commonly single-axis devices, the gas deliverysystems will be subjected to single-axis randomvibrational frequencies in the range of 5500 Hz,sequentially, in each of its three axes.6.2 Prior to initiating the test, examine the gas deliverysystems for physical defects and document the results.6.3 Prior to initiating the test, thoroughly prepare thegas delivery systems for testing. This includes, but isnot limited to, insuring all fasteners and sealingmechanisms are tightened to manufacturers or designspecifications.6.4 The MIL-STD-810 transportation testrecommended herein provides for different accelerationlevels for each of the 3 axes of the device under test.Because the majority of gas delivery systems areshipped in a vertical orientation, this convention ismaintained for the purpose of the transportationsimulation tests. Thus the vertical orientation wouldhave the gas delivery system mounted vertically withrespect to the vibration table top (see Figure 2), thelongitudinal orientation would have the gas deliverysystem mounted flat to the vibration table top (seeFigure 1), and the transverse orientation would have thegas delivery system mounted on its side, against thevibration table top (see Figure 3). Note that the termsvertical, longitudinal, and transverse, arecontextual to motor freight transport, and receivedifferent acceleration levels, within MIL-STD-810. Asimplified and conservative approach to applying MIL-STD-810 involves applying the highest accelerationlevel, associated with the vertical axis, to all threeorientations as illustrated in Figures 13. 6.5 Mount the gas delivery system, in any of itsuntested axes, securely to the vibration table. SeeFigures 13.6.6 Prior to initiating the test at the test site, makecertain that the gas delivery system is leak tight usinginboard test procedures per SEMI F1. A bag leak testmethod is recommended in conjunction with this test.6.7 Initiate and run for 3 hours the vibration testcorresponding to the orientation of the gas deliverysystem.6.8 At the conclusion of the test, examine the gas panelfor physical defects and document the results6.9 At the conclusion of the test, leak test the gasdelivery system using inboard leak procedures perSEMI F1. A bag leak test method is recommended inconjunction with this test. Alternatively, by agreementwith the customer, all leak testing may be withheld untilcompletion of all shock and vibration testing. Thispresumes specific failure mode information is notrequired.6.10 Repeat Sections 6.5 through 6.9 until all 3 axesare tested.6.11 The post-test report should include, at minimum,the following:(1) Pre-test examination results.(2) Pre-test leak rates.(3) Summary and chronology of test events, testinterruptions, and test failures.(4) All vibration measurement data.(5) Post-test examination results.(6) Post-test leak rates.

SEMI F72-1102 © SEMI 20021 SEMI F72-1102TEST METHOD FOR AUGER ELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY (AES)EVALUATION OF OXIDE LAYER OF WETTED SURFACES OFPASSIVATED 316L STAINLESS STEEL COMPONENTS This test method was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility ofthe North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on July 21, 2002. Initially available at www.semi.org October 2002; to be published November2002. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this document is to define a testmethod to characterize the surface composition ofpassivated 316L stainless steel components beingconsidered for installation into a high-purity gasdistribution system. This test method is intended to beapplied to the wetted surfaces of stainless steel tubing,fittings, valves, and other components as a measure ofthe effectiveness of passivation.1.2 The objective of this method is to describe ageneral set of instrument parameters and conditions thatwill achieve reproducible measurements within thechromium-enriched passive oxide layer. 2 Scope2.1 This document describes a test method tocharacterize the composition and thickness of thechromium-enriched oxide layer of stainless steelsurfaces and to detect surface contamination in tubing,fittings, valves and other components. The procedureinvolves detection and measurement of the surfaceelemental composition by Auger Electron Spectroscopy(AES). This procedure also describes the test methodfor a depth compositional profile of Cr, Fe, Ni, O, andC from the as-received surface, through the oxidelayers, and extending into the base metal. Thismeasurement provides oxide thickness and chromiumenrichment information throughout the passivatedregion.2.2 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this test method toestablish appropriate safety and health practices and todetermine the applicability of regulatory limitationsprior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This test method is intended to be used by AESanalysts familiar with the instrumentation andtechnique. The AES instrument must be calibrated andmaintained to pertinent manufacturers specifications.The method is not intended to preclude the use of any particular brand or model of surface analysisequipment. While most of the test methodology hasbeen developed using specific instrumentation, thismethod can be adapted to most Auger surface analyticalinstrumentation.3.2 Quantification of the elemental compositions isperformed with handbook values of the relativeelemental sensitivity factors. These sensitivity factorsdo not allow for differences due to the chemicalenvironment of the elements, and are thus not accuratein this instance in which the chemical environmentchanges from the passive oxide layer to the metal alloy.In addition, quantification is affected by the choice ofinstruments and instrument parameters. For thesereasons the results of this test method may not bereproducible between different instruments andoperators. Use of the results of this test method shouldbe restricted to process development and comparison toan historical database of AES data from the samesource.3.3 The effects of the depth of analysis of the techniqueand surface contamination affect the results of this testmethod. These are discussed in the attached appendix.Surface roughness, non-planarity of the surface, anddifferential sputtering rates for the different chemicalspecies also cause measurement uncertainties in thistest method.3.4 The results of this test method have not beendemonstrated to affect performance of stainless steelcomponents in high purity gas distribution systems forsemiconductor manufacturing. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardSEMI F19  Specification for the Finish of the WettedSurfaces of Electropolished 316L Stainless SteelComponents

SEMI F72-1102 © SEMI 20023 11 Test Specimens11.1 Specimens are to be sectioned to appropriate sizefor the particular AES instrument using a clean, dryhacksaw or dry low speed bandsaw. Any samplepreparation shall avoid introducing contamination ontothe surface to be measured. Clean noncontaminatinggloves and tweezers should be used to handle samples,avoiding contact with the area of interest. In addition,preparation must avoid excessive heating of the sample;i.e., the surface temperature shall not exceed 50 oC, toavoid oxide growth or change in surface composition.11.2 Sample preparation should preferably be done bythe component manufacturer. Following sectioning thesample(s) are to be cleaned and packaged per themanufacturers standard final cleaning and packagingprocedures.11.3 If sample preparation is done by other than themanufacturer, the sample(s) may be cleaned in DI waterand dried promptly. If the sample(s) are not to beanalyzed immediately they should be packaged bywrapping in clean metal foil or sealing in cleanroomquality nylon bags.11.4 If sample preparation is done by other than themanufacturer this shall be stated in the report narrativeand the analytical results are not to be interpreted asindicative of the manufacturers quality of cleaning andpackaging procedures. A note to this effect shall beincluded in all tables of reported results of thecomposition of the surface.11.5 After preparation, samples should be analyzedpromptly, with allowance for shipping times andqueuing time at the analyst. 12 Preparation of Apparatus12.1 Instruments shall be routinely tested inaccordance with manufacturer recommendations toassure proper performance. The instrument vacuumshall be 1.0  10 -7 Torr or better during the analysis. 13 Calibration and Standardization13.1 Instrument calibration for etch rates andsensitivity factors shall be performed in accordancewith instrument manufacturer recommendations orother established method. 14 Procedure14.1 The sample is to be mounted in accordance withmanufacturer's recommendations and in a mannerconsistent with ultra-high vacuum surface analyticalprocedures. Some of these practices are detailed inASTM E 1078. The area to be analyzed should be mounted parallel to the sample holder surface so thatthe TOA is known.14.2 Place the sample in the AES introduction chamberfor pumpdown. Transfer to the analytical chamber atthe manufacturer's recommended base pressure.14.3 Align the sample with respect to the electronbeam and analyzer so that optimum count rate from thedesired analytical location is obtained. The surface areato be analyzed should be free of sample preparationdebris, visible particles and large defect features, ifpossible.14.4 A large beam size or scan area should be used toattempt measurement of a representative surface.Elemental survey data (approximately 0-2000 eV) areto be measured from the sample surface to determinethe elements present and their approximate surfaceabundances. A signal-to-noise ratio of 2 is usuallyadequate to ensure detection of elements present at oneatomic percent or greater levels. A typical surveyspectrum is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1Auger Spectrum of Stainless Steel Surface 14.5 Acquire a depth composition profile to determinethe relative abundances of Cr, Fe, Ni, O, and C. Theprofile may be acquired in a simultaneous or analternating etch/data acquisition mode. Measurementof each element shall be made at a frequency of at leastone data point every 5  within the first 50  and onedata point every 10  from 50  to the profile end. Anappropriate scan acquisition time is one that optimizes

&lt;!-- Page 43 --&gt;

SEMI F72-1102 © SEMI 2002 4 spectral resolution and signal/noise, and that has at leastten data points in each spectral window. The depthprofile should be continued into the depth of the sampleuntil the Fe, Cr and Ni levels are approximatelyconstant.14.6 Depth profile data are presented as signal intensityof each element with etch time (i.e., depth), and asatomic concentration with etch time. Depths may beestimated from etch times by determination of the etchrate on a known thickness of standard material. Atypical AES profile is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2Auger Depth Profile of Stainless Steel15 Calculations and Interpretation of Results15.1 Most manufacturers supply software forcalculation of the approximate elemental compositionfrom the survey spectrum and the depth profile data.The elemental composition should be estimated usingsensitivity factors appropriate to the instrument, eachelement, and resolution settings for each measurement.AES spectra are considered only semiquantitative, dueto instrument geometry and the chemical formdependency of each element's sensitivity factor.Evaluations of elemental composition should thereforebe limited to similar samples analyzed on the sameinstrument.15.2 The signal intensity with etch time graph may beused to calculate oxide thickness, defined as the point atwhich the oxygen signal decreases to half its maximumvalue. The thickness of surface carbon contaminationis calculated in the same way from the carbon signal. 15.3 Relative abundances of profiled elements arerecorded on the atomic concentration with etch timegraph. 16 Reporting Results16.1 A tabular summary of estimated surface elementalcomposition is to be supplied with its associatedelemental survey spectrum.16.2 Tabular summaries of oxide thickness, thicknessof the region in which Cr concentration exceeds Feconcentration, thickness of a surface Fe enrichment (ifpresent), and carbon thickness are to be supplied withassociated depth profile graphs.16.3 Optionally, parameters such as maximum Cr/Feratio may be reported. However, the value of themaximum Cr/Fe ratio is subject to instrument geometryand sensitivity factor variations, and should not be usedfor primary evaluation purposes. Comparativeevaluations should only be made from data collected bythe same instrument with an identical protocol.16.4 Data acquisition parameters, including instrumentgeometry, electron beam size or scan area, and otherpertinent settings are to be supplied. The manufacturerand model number of instrument used is to be reported.Analyst identity and analysis date are also requiredinformation. Each table and graph must be clearlylabeled with sample identification.

SEMI F72-1102 © SEMI 20025 APPENDIX 1DISCUSSION OF EFFECTS OF DEPTH OF ANALYSIS ON DEPTHPROFILE ANALYSIS BY AUGER ELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY FORSURFACE CHEMISTRY ANALYSIS OF PASSIVATED STAINLESSSTEELNOTE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI F72 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures. Thisappendix was derived from presentations made to the Stainless Steel and Surface Analysis Workshop2. 2 Stainless Steel and Surface Analysis Workshop, March, 1999; Interpratation of Depth Profile Analysis Data, Dave Harris, Charles Evans andAssociates. A1-1A1-1.1 The purpose of this appendix is to describe theAuger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) technique andexplain the interpretation of the depth profile analysiswith respect to the structure and composition of thepassive oxide layer on stainless steel. The effect of thedepth of analysis on the measured chromium to ironratio, the oxide thickness, and the depth of enrichmentis discussed. The discussion also applies to depthprofile analyses performed by ESCA (ElectronSpectroscopy for Chemical Analysis, sometimesreferred to as X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, orXPS).A1-1.2 Auger  The mechanism of Auger electrongeneration is illustrated in Figure A1-1. The energy ofthe Auger electron is determined by the energies of theelectron energy levels participating in the generationprocess and are unique for each chemical element.Thus the elements present in the analyzed region maybe determined by analysis of the energies of emittedAuger electrons.

Energy released by 1kicks out Auger Electronfrom higher energy level Figure A1-1Schematic Representation of Auger ElectronGeneration Process A1-1.3 The Auger technique makes use of an electronbeam for primary excitation, typically of energy in therange 2 to 5 keV. The electron beam may by defocusedto analyze a relatively large area of the surface, of theorder of micrometers, or focussed and rastered tomap the distribution of elements on the surface. Anelectron energy analyzer is focused at the same point asthe incident electron beam, and the Auger electrons thatescape the surface are detected and analyzed. Theanalysis is commonly presented as the derivative of theelectron signal intensity N as a function of energy E,dN(E)/dE, of the spectrum to enhance the visibility ofthe small Auger electron peaks relative to thebackground. An example of an Auger electronspectroscopy spectrum of a stainless steel surface isshown in Figure 1 of this test method. A1-2 Illuminated Volume and SurfaceSensitivity A1-2.1 The incident electron beam penetrates wellbelow the surface. Auger electrons are generated allthrough this illuminated volume. The Inelastic MeanFree Path (IMFP) of an electron in a solid is the meandistance through the solid that an electron can travelbefore losing some of its energy (suffering an inelasticinteraction). The IMFP is a function of the electronsenergy and the matrix through which it is traveling.Electrons with an energy typical of Auger and ESCAelectrons, approximately 1 keV, have an IMFP of about10 angstroms. That means that a 1 keV electron willtravel, on average, 10 angstroms before interacting withthe matrix and giving up some of its energy. In otherwords it will be scattered to lower energy and will notbe part of the photoelectron or Auger electron line forits element. The IMFP is a statistical parameter and anelectron may travel several IMFPs before having acollision. The several IMFPs is called the escapedepth of the electron, or the depth of analysis, as shown

SEMI F72-1102 © SEMI 2002 6 in Figure A1-2. Although Auger and ESCA areconsidered surface analytical tools, their depth ofanalysis is on the order of 50 angstroms, or about one tothree times the depth of the oxide film found on atypical passivated stainless steel surface. Figure A1-2The Electron Escape Depth of Low EnergyElectrons in Some Metals A1-3 Depth of Analysis FunctionA1-3.1 There has been some discussion with respectto the Depth of Analysis Function. There is oneschool that believes that it is 5 IMFPs and another thatuses 3 IMFPs. These two functions will be referred toas 5 and 3 respectively. It will be seen that it makeslittle difference which function is used even though thedepth of the oxide films is of the order of the functions.These functions are seen in Figure A1-3, which showsthe proportion of the total signal generated from eachdepth below the surface. The Y-axis is in decimal andthe X-axis is in angstroms from the surface. The firstpoint of the 5 curve is 0.16 at the 1 st angstrom level.That means that 16% of the signal comes from the 1 stangstrom, 14% from the 2 nd angstrom level and so ondown to 1% from the 25th angstrom level. Thuselements that do not appear on the surface or in the first24 angstroms in from the surface, but do exist at the 25angstrom level will be detected. 5 Lambda 00.020.040.060.080.10.120.140.160.18 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25Angstroms3 Lambda 00.020.040.060.080.10.120.140.160.18 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25Angstroms Figure A1-3These Two Graphs Represent the Depth ofAnalysis That Will be Seen When Analyzing 1 keVElectrons.

It represents 25 angstroms of pureCr 2O 3 on an atomically flat 316L stainless steel surface,with no surface or interfacial contamination present.Figures A1-5a and b are the theoretical depth profilesderived by assuming a depth of analysis of 5 and 3respectively. The first factor to note is that Fe, Ni andMo appear most or all of the way through the depthprofile of the oxide due to the contribution of the metalsubstrate to the detected signal, the depth of analysiseffect as introduced above. 1 keV electrons can escapefrom as deep as 25 angstroms. This must beappreciated when interpreting these depth profiles.

Historically, the FWHM (Full Width HalfMaximum; the width of a peak measured at half itsmaximum height) of the oxygen profile has been usedas the measure of oxide thickness. It is apparent inFigures A1-4 and A1-5 that this underestimates theoxide thickness by 15 to 20 %.A1-4.3 It should also be noted that the Cr:Fe ratiomeasured from Figures A1-4 and A1-5 has itsmaximum value at the initial surface, decreasing as thedepth profile progresses, whereas the actual Cr:Fe ratioin Figure A1-4 is infinite down to 25 angstroms. Mostactual depth profiles exhibit a maximum of the Cr:Feratio at some depth below the initial surface, referred toas the depth of maximum enrichment. This is aconsequence of variation in the actual composition ofthe oxide, possibly having a higher concentration of Fenear the surface, a phenomenon commonly termed adetached iron oxide layer, or of contamination on thesurface, generally hydrocarbons. These are discussedin the next sectionA1-5 Effects of Detached Iron Oxide Layerand Surface ContaminationA1-5.1 The model composition profile of Figure A1-6shows 3 angstroms of pure Fe2O 3 over 22 angstroms ofpure Cr2O 3 on 316L stainless steel. This is a model of adetached iron oxide layer. Figure A1-7 is thetheoretical depth profile of this model derived assuminga depth of analysis of 5. Note that the initial Cr valuein the profile is higher than the Fe value, even thoughthe surface is pure Fe2O 3. This is a consequence of thedepth of analysis detecting the Cr from levels beneaththe surface. The Cr:Fe ratio for this model has itsmaximum value at 3 angstroms below the initial surface.

Figure A1-9 is thetheoretical depth profile of this model assuming a depthof analysis of 5. In this case the O, Cr and Fe atomicconcentration values are reduced by the presence of thecarbon until the depth profiling proceeds past thecarbon, but they have the same relative values (ie: sameCr:Fe ratio) versus depth as derived in theuncontaminated model. The maximum of the Cr:Feratio is seen to be at the initial surface. Although theactual oxide thickness is less in this model, the FWHMmeasure of the oxide thickness from the depth profile isthe same due to the presence of the carbon layer. Note

Figure A1-11 is the theoretical depthprofile of this model assuming a depth of analysis of 5. This profile is seen to be similar to the depth profilesgenerally observed for passivated stainless steel. TheCr:Fe ratio maximum occurs below the initial surface,and the initial surface atomic concentrations of theelements of interest are diluted by the presence of thecarbon layer on the surface.

Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on August 29, 2002. Initially available at www.semi.org September 2002; to be publishedNovember 2002. 1 Purpose1.1 This document defines a uniform procedure fortesting the wetted surfaces of stainless steel componentsintended for installation into high purity gas distributionsystems. This procedure characterizes the occurrence,frequency, and in some cases the identity ofmicroscopic surface defects and contaminants that mayappear on the wetted surfaces. It should be noted thatthere has been no direct correlation made between theresults of this test method and contamination of processgases or product yields in processes served by highpurity gas distribution systems. Application of this testmethod is intended to yield comparable andreproducible results among various users of this methodfor the purposes of qualification of components.1.2 The objective of this method is to describe ageneral set of instrument parameters and conditions thatwill achieve precise and reproducible measurements ofimportant parameters regarding the surface condition. 2 Scope2.1 This procedure applies to the wetted surfaces instainless steel tubing, fittings, valves, and othercomponents to determine the effectiveness of surfacefinishing and cleaning processes. The techniquedescribes counting of surface defects including pits,inclusions, inclusion stringers, scratches, residualprocess marks, grain boundaries and contamination onthe wetted surfaces. However, any surface damageproduced during sample preparation is to be excludedfrom such assessment.2.2 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This test method is primarily intended to determinethe frequency of occurrence (surface density) andidentity of microscopic surface defects, down to a sizerange of ≥ approximately 0.1 micrometer, that may be detrimental to high purity gas distribution systems.Such defects may not be identifiable by visual ormagnified optical inspection, but concentrations ofmicroscopic surface defects may cause visuallyapparent defects such as haze.3.2 This test method requires sectioning of thespecimen(s) used for test purposes and is thereforedestructive.3.3 The method must be applied to representativeexamples of process lots to determine quality of theprocesses employed and/or lots processed. As the areasexamined and measured by this method are very small,the results may not be representative of all areas or alllots processed.3.4 This test method may be subject to operator bias inselection of representative areas and definition ofcountable defects.3.5 Detection of countable defects is affected byoperator selection of SEM operating conditions andimage recording conditions. This test method assumesthat the operator is sufficiently proficient in operationof the SEM to minimize this limitation, per instructionsin the procedures.3.6 SEM imaging will reveal surface finish flaws, butmay not show features that are well rounded by anelectropolishing or other surface leveling process.3.7 Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maybe used in this test method to analyze surfacecontaminants at least approximately one micrometer inthickness and inclusions at least approximately onemicrometer in size. EDS is not an appropriatetechnique for analysis of the oxide passive layer on thestainless steel surface, as EDS analyzes down to a depthof the order of 1 micrometer below the surface, and theoxide passive layer is only 0.001 to 0.01 micrometerdeep.
