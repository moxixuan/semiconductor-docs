The pressure and temperature of thesample must be within the tolerances specified by the manufacturer.9.1.3.6 Pass 100 mL of nitrous oxide through the detector tube.9.1.3.7 Determine the concentration of ammonia according to the detector tube manufacturers instructions. Theconcentration may not exceed the specification in Table 1 of this standard.9.2 Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide  This procedure is for the determination of carbon monoxide andcarbon dioxide in nitrous oxide using a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector and methanizer withback flush, (see Figure A1-1).NOTE 2: In order to prevent nitrous oxide interference, a helium backflush to vent is needed for 35 times the analysis time(estimated to be 35 minutes). Because nitrous oxide is converted into ammonia in the methanizer, stainless steel (ss) is required;copper tubing and fittings are not used. The backflush removes the nitrous oxide from Column No. 1 preparing the column forthe next sample. Careful timing is required to identify carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide distinguishing both from the timemethane would appear, if present. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are converted to methane in the methanizer; therefore,both will be detected by the FID detector at the specific times determined by the analytical sequence of the standard.9.2.1 Detection Limit  1 ppm (mol/mol), (50 ppb depending on conditions).9.2.2 Instrument Parameters9.2.2.1 Columns: Column 1: Porapak QS, 4.6 m (15 ft) by 5 mm (3/16 in) or equivalent.

SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 4 2.3 A complete purchase specification requires that additional physical properties be specified along with testmethods suitable for determining their magnitude. This standard provides a comprehensive listing of suchproperties and associated test methods. This listing provides a systematic basis for constructing the purchasespecification for any kind of polished silicon wafer or substrate and is expected to be used for such purposes.2.4 These specifications apply specifically to prime silicon wafers with at least one chem-mechanically polishedsurface. Ground, lapped, and unpolished wafers are not covered in this specification but this specification mayprovide guidance in connection with their procurement.2.5 In addition, these specifications cover specification requirements for basic 300 mm diameter, double-sidepolished silicon wafers that are suitable for many advanced integrated circuit applications. If this kind of wafer isdesired, physical properties other than those listed in the table of requirements shall not be included in the purchasespecification.2.6 These specifications do not cover the requirements for the following related silicon materials and wafers: Polycrystalline silicon (see SEMI M16 or JEITA EM-3601), Epitaxial wafers (see SEMI M2 or SEMI M11), Epitaxial wafers with buried layer (see SEMI M18), Test wafers (see SEMI M8), Premium wafers (see SEMI M24), Reclaimed wafers (see SEMI M38), Annealed wafers (see SEMI M57), SOI wafers (see SEMI M34, SEMI M41, SEMI M47, or JEITA EM-3603), Dielectrically isolated wafers (see SEMI M22), and Solar-grade silicon wafers (see SEMI M6).They do, however, provide the ordering information for test, premium, and reclaimed wafers, as well as the orderinginformation for the polished substrates and starting wafers used to prepare epitaxial, annealed, and SOI wafers.2.7 The complete EDI Code List for items in the Order Form appropriate to silicon wafers, including polishedwafers and substrates, can be found in SEMI M18.2.8 For referee purposes, U.S. customary units shall be used for wafers of 2 in. and 3 in. nominal diameters, and SI(system international, commonly called metric) units for 100 mm and larger diameter wafers.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M2  Specification for Silicon Epitaxial Wafers for Discrete Device ApplicationsSEMI M6  Specification for Silicon Wafers for Use as Photovoltaic Solar CellsSEMI M8  Specification for Polished Monocrystalline Silicon Test WafersSEMI M11  Specifications for Silicon Epitaxial Wafers for Integrated Circuit (IC) ApplicationsSEMI M12  Specification for Serial Alphanumeric Marking of the Front Surface of WafersSEMI M13  Specifications for Alphanumeric Marking of Silicon WafersSEMI M16  Specification for Polycrystalline SiliconSEMI M18  Format for Silicon Wafer Specification Form for Order Entry

However, even if these requirements table values are used,the desired test methodology must be selected in accordance with 5.2.5.4.2 It is essential that all choices for the items selected to be specified be made in order not to have unspecifiedparameters that would lead to surprises between supplier and customer. This is particularly important in thespecification of wafer site flatness, for which a variety of parameters must be selected as outlined in Appendix 1.5.4.3 Of the various items listed, the following (listed in the order in which they appear in Table 1) are most oftenselected, especially for wafers to be used for advanced integrated circuit manufacture: nominal edge exclusion (to define the fixed quality area), structural characteristics, wafer ID marking, total thickness variation (TTV or GBIR), warp (and sometimes bow or sori), site flatness (SFQR), and localized light scatterers (LLS). 6 Requirements6.1 General Characteristics6.1.1 The crystal growth method shall be modified Czochralski (Cz), float zone (FZ), or magnetic Czochralski(MCz) as specified on the purchase order. In some cases, the supplier is given the option of selecting Cz or MCz.6.1.1.1 If the Cz or MCz method is used for crystal growth, it may be permissible to utilize refined (previouslymelted) polysilicon in the growth charge; when this is the case, the appropriate box should be checked..6.1.2 The crystal orientation shall be as specified on the purchase order. Usually either (100) or (111) is specified,but (110) is sometimes specified for polished wafers to be used for making SOI wafers. Occasionally, anotherorientation, such as (311) or (511), is specified.6.1.3 The conductivity type shall be either n or p.6.1.4 The dopant shall be specified to match the conductivity type. In general, boron (B) is used for p-typematerial, while phosphorus (P) is most commonly used for n-type material. For some applications, antimony (Sb) orarsenic (As) are used to obtain n-type wafers. For high power applications, neutron transmutation doping is oftenused to obtain high resistivity n-type wafers.6.1.5 The nominal edge exclusion, EE, specifies the diameter of the fixed quality area (FQA), which is given by thenominal diameter minus 2EE (see Figure 1). This quantity provides a center-referenced property.

OTHER (as required) #1 The nominal edge exclusion, EE, specifies the diameter of the FQA, which is given by the nominal diameter (see Item 2-6.1) minus 2 EE (see Figure 1). This quantity provides a center referenced property. Although use of edge referenced properties is discouraged, some equipments and procedures are based on edge referenced dimensions. When this occurs, the quality area is not fixed and some part of the fixed quality area may fall outside the evaluated area, which is generally not a desirable situation.#2 If specified as polished, this term is meant to imply a surface condition and not a particular processing technique. If desired, a quantitative measure of surface finish may optionally be indicated byspecifying the rms microroughness over a specified spatial frequency (or wavelength) range. Because a standardized test method has not yet been developed for this metric, both values and test procedures, including sampling plan and detrending procedures, shall be agreed upon between supplier and customer.#3 Flatness Acronyms are defined in the Flatness Decision Tree in Appendix 1.#4 In todays technology, it may be possible to inspect for some of these items using automated surface scanning inspection systems (SSIS). Such systems should be calibrated according to SEMI M53using polystyrene latex spheres deposited in accordance with SEMI M58. Some indication of the defects separable by such instruments is provided in SEMI M35; however, a standard test procedure hasyet to be developed.

However, it should be noted that not all processes and metrology can work asclose to the wafer edge as implied by the nominal edge exclusion.6.1.5.2 In addition, it is sometimes necessary to specify additional exclusion zones, such as those for waferidentification marks or wafer holding areas.6.1.5.3 Although use of edge referenced properties is discouraged, some equipments and procedures are based onedge referenced dimensions. When this occurs, the quality area is not fixed and some part of the fixed quality areamay fall outside the evaluated area, which is generally not a desirable situation.6.1.6 A co-dopant may be required for polished wafers intended to be processed into annealed wafers. Some co-dopants may also be used in connection with control of oxygen precipitation characteristics even when the wafer isnot annealed.6.1.7 Wafer Surface Orientation  The wafer shall conform to the surface orientation as specified in the purchaseorder.6.1.7.1 For on-orientation wafers, the angular tolerance from the plane perpendicular to the growth axis shall bespecified.6.1.7.2 For off-orientation wafers, both the misorientation angle from the growth axis and its angular tolerance shallbe specified.6.1.7.2.1 A misorientation angle between 0.2° and 1.0° (0.6° ± 0.4°) from a (100) plane is frequently used for someepitaxial substrates.6.1.7.2.2 A misorientation angle of 2.50° or 4.00° ± 0.5° from a (111) plane is often used for other epitaxialsubstrates.6.1.7.3 Orthogonal misorientation is the tilt angle of the normal to a (111) wafer surface toward nearest &lt;110&gt;direction in a plane parallel with the primary flat as indicated in Figure 2. NOTE: If the off-orientation angle is determined with the seed end up, the polished surface of the finishedwafer must be the surface toward the seed end, and vice versa. Polishing of the incorrect wafer surfaceresults in an incorrect wafer tilt, which can cause unwanted pattern shifts and distortions if the wafer is usedsubsequently for epitaxial layer growth. Because the convention for determining the off-orientation angle isnot the same worldwide, it is essential to establish accurately the desired convention.Figure 2Orthogonal Misorientation of &#123;111&#125; Wafer6.1.7.3.1 The contribution of 5° of orthogonal misorientation to the total off-orientation angle is less than 0.5°.6.1.7.4 For ion implant applications, the following tolerance issues should be considered:6.1.7.4.1 For general use where channeling is to be avoided, the current wafer orientation specification of ±1.0°deviation from the \[100\] axis (perpendicular to the (100) plane of the wafer) is adequate. This specification issuitable for minimum channeling applications, provided that the appropriate ion implant equipment angle settingsare employed.

SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 20 6.1.7.4.2 Uniform, maximum channeling along the \[100\] axis perpendicular to the (100) wafer surface is stronglydependent on strict adherence to a 0° tilt angle. To achieve maximum channeling, crystallography requires theorientation to be within ±0.1° of a &lt;100&gt; direction. Also, the customer must remove all overlying oxide, nitride,poly, etc., layers from the wafer prior to a channeling implant. The customer must maintain very rigid control of theion implant equipment angle setting in order to achieve maximum channeling across the wafer.6.1.7.5 The tolerance of ±0.1° is derived from experimental ion implant profile data and ion implant modelingactivity for implants into (100) silicon wafers. The ranges for which data was obtained are given in Table 2.6.2 Electrical Characteristics6.2.1 The center-point room temperature resistivity of thewafers shall conform to the nominal and tolerance valuesspecified on the purchase order.6.2.2 The wafers shall conform to any requirementsspecified on the purchase order for radial resistivityvariation, resistivity striations and minority carrierlifetime.6.3 Chemical Characteristics6.3.1 The wafers shall conform to any requirements specified on the purchase order for oxygen concentration, radialoxygen variation, carbon concentration, and, for heavily doped (low resistivity) n-type silicon wafers only,compensating boron concentration.6.4 Structural Characteristics6.4.1 The wafers shall conform to any requirements specified on the purchase order for dislocation etch pit density,slip, lineage, twin, swirl, shallow pits, oxidation induced stacking faults (OSF), oxide precipitates or bulkmicrodefects (BMD), interstitial oxygen reduction upon appropriate heat treatment, and bulk defects by X-raytopoography.6.5 Wafer Preparation Characteristics6.5.1 Wafer ID MarkingWhere wafer ID marking is specified on the purchase order, the kind of marking must beindicated.6.5.1.1 Where alphanumeric marking is specified for wafers of 200 mm diameter and smaller, the code characterproperties and code field location shall conform either to SEMI M13 or to SEMI M12, as specified on the purchaseorder.6.5.1.2 Where back-surface bar code marking is specified for wafers of 200 mm diameter and smaller, the codesymbol and its location shall conform to SEMI T1.6.5.1.3 Where two-dimensional matrix code marking is specified for wafers of 200 mm diameter and smaller, thecode symbol and its location shall conform to SEMI T2.6.5.1.4 All 300 mm diameter wafers (wafer category 1.15, see Table 9) shall be marked with a two-dimensionalmatrix code symbol on the back surface outside the fixed quality area as soon after slicing as practical in the mannerspecified in SEMI T7 in order to provide both identification of these wafers and traceability of each wafer back tothe ingot from which it was cut. The back surface is identified as the wafer surface with the two-dimensional matrixcode symbol.6.5.1.4.1 Optionally, the user may specify an additional back-surface mark as shown in Figure 3. This markcontains alphanumeric characters with: The same message characters as the SEMI T7 mark and appropriate checksum characters as defined by SEMIM12 and Character string as specified in SEMI M12.NOTE 1: It is expected that this optional alphanumeric mark will not be used after users have developed successful experiencewith SEMI T7 mark usage.

In addition, the tolerance on thefield dimensions is not cumulative.Figure 3Optional A/N Code Field Location on Back Surface of Notched 300 mm Diameter Wafer (Category 1.15)NOTE 2: The overall length tolerance of the A/N mark is more stringent than that in SEMI M12.
