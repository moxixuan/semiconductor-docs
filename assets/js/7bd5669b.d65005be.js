ASTM Test Method F 1390 is an automated,\nnon-contact  method  which  provides  for  correction  of  the\nwafer deflection due to gravitational effects. The scan pattern\ncovers  the  entire  fixed  quality  area.  ASTM  Test  Method  F\n657 is a manual, non-contact method which has a continuous,\nprescribed  scan  pattern  which  covers  only  a  portion  of  the\nwafer  surface.  There  is  no  provision  for  correction  of  the\nwafer  deflection  due  to  gravitational  effects.  As  noted  in\nAppendix  2,  different  reference  planes  are  used  for  the  two\nmethods. Because Test Method F 657 employs a back surface\nreference plane, the measured warp may include contributions\nfrom  thickness  variation  of  the  wafer.  Test  Method  F  1390\nemploys   a   median   surface   reference   plane   and   is   not\nsusceptible   to   interferences   from   thickness   variations.   In\ngeneral,  Test  Method  F  1390  is  preferred,  especially  for\nwafers  150  mm  in  diameter  and  larger,  although  ASTM  Test\nMethod F 1530 may also be used for this determination.\n10. 21  Sori \u2014 If sori is specified in lieu of bow or warp\nor  both,  determine  by  a  method  agreed  upon  between\nthe supplier and the purchaser.\nNOTE  4:    Because  sori  is  a  property  of  the  top  surface  of  an\nunclamped  wafer,  it  may  be  measured  on  many  types  of\nflatness  measuring  instruments.  ASTM  Test  Method  F  1451\nmay, in principle, be used for determination of sori.\n10. 22  Flatness \u2014 Determine by a method agreed upon\nbetween    the    supplier    and    the    purchaser.    It    is\nrecommended   that   site   flatness   is   determined   in\naccordance  with  ASTM  Test  Method  F  1530  using  a\nsite-by-site  front  surface  reference  (indicated  by  the\nacronym SFQR in the Flatness Decision tree (see SEMI\nM1, Figure A1-1)).

This calibration coefficient is used to calculate\nthe carbon concentration of specimens.\n5. 3   For  room  temperature  measure ment,  a  baseline  is\ndrawn  in  the  differential  spectrum  (after  subtraction  of\nthe    reference    sample    spectrum)    from    which    an\nabsorption  coefficient  is  derived.  The  range  of  baseline\nshould be wider than \xb1 10 cm\n-1\n. The baseline has to be\ndetermined in an interval of the spectra which is neither\ninfluenced  by  main  peak  at  580  cm\n-1\nnor  the  side  peak\nat   576   cm\n-1\n.   For   77K   measurement,   the   range   of\nbaseline should be wider than \xb1 1.5 cm\n-1\n.\n6  Significance and Use\n6. 1     Carbon    plays    an    important    role     in    the\ndetermination  of  the  compensation  mechanism  which\ndetermines  the  semi-insulating  behavior  of  GaAs.  As\nsuch  the  concentration  is  critical  in  determining  the\nsubstrate resistivity.\n6. 2   As  a  dominant  acceptor  in  SI-G aAs  substrates,\ncarbon   could,   potentially   impact   ion   implantation\nactivation.\n7  Interferences\n7. 1   Stray  light  that  reaches  the  det ector  will  tend  to\nreduce  the  calculated  absorption  coefficient  value  and\nthereby reduce the reported carbon concentration.\n7. 2   FT-IR  instrument  instruction  m a nuals  should  be\nconsulted if problems with the technique are suspected.\n7. 3   The  carbon  absorption  band  ha lf  width  at  room\ntemperature  must  be  less  than  2  cm\n-1\nfor  acceptable\nmeasurement  results.  Excessive  width  can  be  due  to\nimproper thickness matching or stress.\n7. 4  Specimens that do not exceed  the instrument beam\nsize  will  cause  error.  Use  of  apertures,  or  preferably\nbeam condensers, can correct this problem.\n7. 5   The  minimum  detection  level   o f  this  method  is\nlimited by the signal-to-noise ratio of the recording.\n8  Apparatus\n8. 1   FT-IR  with  an  operating  range   that  includes  the\nregion  of  700  to  500  cm\n-1\n.

All  required  convex  features  may  also  have  a  radius  of  up  to  r66  to  prevent  small\ncontact  patches  with  large  stresses  that  might  cause  wear  and  particles.  Note  that  these  limits  on  the  radius  of  all\nrequired features are specified as a maximum (not a minimum) to ensure that the required features are not rounded\noff too much. The lower bound on the radius is up to the FOSB supplier. Note also that this radius applies to every\nrequired feature unless another radius is called out specifically. Here a required feature is an area on the surface of\nthe  FOSB  supplier.  Note  also  that  this  radius  applies  to  every  required  feature  unless  another  radius  is  called  out\nspecifically. Here a required feature is an area on the surface of the FOSB specified by a dimension (or intersections\nof dimensions) that has a tolerance and not just a maximum or minimum (such as the edges of the robotic handling\nflange).\n5. 4  Door \u2014 It is recommended that the FOSB not be vertical when it is opened or closed. When the FOSB is in a\nvertical  orientation  with  the  door  removed,  the  wafers  must  be  restrained  from  touching  each  other  by  appropriate\nwafer support design or other retaining techniques.\n5. 4.1  Manual  Door  \u2014  If  chosen,  the  manual  door  option  requires  no  automation  to  open  the  door.  An  exclusion\nzone surrounding the manual door area is specified in the standard. There are several possible techniques for sealing\nand  clamping  the  manual  door  that  meet  user  requirements.  Therefore,  only  an  exclusion  zone  surrounding  the\nmanual door area is specified in this standard. All features of the door and door retaining mechanism must lie within\nthe  exclusion  zone  illustrated  in  Figure  1  and  must  not  interfere  with  other  specified  features  (including  the\nkinematic couplings). Figure 1 and dimensions x81, y50, y81, y82, z47, z48 and z49 define the manual door area and\ntherefore  apply  only  to  the  manual  door  option  as  described  in  this  section.    The  y81  dimension  applies  from  the\nhorizontal  datum  plane  to  the  top  surfaces  of  the  FOSB  (z47-z48  or  z47+z49  at  the  upper  door  frame  volume\nspecified by y50).\n5. 4.2  Automated-shippable Door \u2014 If chosen, the automated-shippable door must be designed to mate with a port\nthat conforms to SEMI E62. However, following characteristics of automate-shippable door must be considered.\n5. 4.2.1  Wafer  Retaining  Structure  \u2014  The  slot  is  usually  designed  that  wafers  are  suspended  in  the  slot  without\ncontacting  the  surface  of  the  slot  for  preventing  the  damage  during  transportation  when  FOSB  door  is  closed.  It\nshould be noted that wafer position of FOSB is different from that of FOUP when the door is closed due to the wafer\nretaining structure.\n5. 4.2.2  Rear  of  Door (y51)  \u2014  For  manual  door,  FOSB  has  a  y51\n\u2265  50  mm  to  hold  wafers  in  large  area  at  front\nwafer  retainer  for  keeping  wafer  quality  during  transportation.  For  automated-shippable  door,  FOSB  has  a\ny51\u2265 140 mm to comply with SEMI E47.1.\n5. 4.2.3  Force  between  Box  Door  and  Box (f34:  defined  by  SEMI  E62)  \u2014  f34  is  related  to  wafer  retaining  force\nthough,  need  to  consider  door  is  pulled  by  latching  too.  Even  though,  f34  is  increased,  minimum  force  applied  to\nwafer would be recommended for eliminating damage to the wafers in dynamic motion for opening and closing the\ndoor.\n5. 4.2.4  Latch  Key  Torque  (f30:  defined  by  SEMI  E62)  \u2014  The  required  latch  key  torque  depends  on  the  closing\nforce.\n5. 4.2.5  A FOSB with an automated-shippable door should be able to withstand a force when applied to one of the\nretaining features of up to 40N (f61) in any direction without negative impact to the intended function of the FOSB\n(e.g. shell deformation, wafer positions, door closing capabilities).\n5. 5  Seal Zones for Door \u2014 In the Front Opening Shipping Box Automated Door Option the automated box door is\non the front side of the box (corresponding to the front side of the carrier where wafers are accessed so the door is\nperpendicular to the wafers and parallel to the facial datum plane).  The automated door and the carrier frame must\nhave  surfaces  that  mate  with  the  seal  zones  defined  in  SEMI  E62.    Specifically,  the  FOSB  automated  box  door\noption and the carrier frame must have surfaces that made with the seal zones and the reserved spaces for vacuum\napplication (which includes all of the circles bounded by r38 except for the holes for the registrations at the center of\neach circle) defined in \xa75 of SEMI E62 (which specifies r38 as well as the seal zone dimensions).  These automated\ndoor and frame surfaces must be a distance of y52 from the facial datum plane and must have a flatness of y42.  No\nsurface  on  the  automated  door  may  project  further  from  the  facial  datum  plane  than  the  door  seal  zone  and  the\nreserved spaces for vacuum application.  The automated door must also be designed so that when the box is pressed\nagainst the FIMS port, both latch keys on the port are inserted to their full length.  Furthermore, when the latch keys"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M31-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1998, 2005 5\nare turned more than 45\xb0 toward the position that unlocks the automated door from the box, the latch key holes on\nthe door must be such that the door is not removable from the latch keys.  There are no door seal zone requirements\nfor the manual door option, but a FOSB with the manual door must contain a frame seal zone that meets the frame\nseal zone requirements specified in this section.\n5. 6  Wafer Retaining \u2014 When the FOSB is closed, the wafers must be retained in the FOSB to prevent movement\nduring  subsequent  handling,  including  shipping.  It  should  be  noted  that  wafers  are  typically  shipped  in  a  vertical\norientation and generally require support from a secondary package. It is recommended that this secondary package\nbe designed to allow for easy removal of the FOSB from the secondary package."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Figure 1\nManual Door Area"),(0,i.yg)("ol",{start:5},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"7  Wafer Orientation and Numbering \u2014 The wafers must be horizontal when the FOSB is placed on the coupling,\nand the wafers slots are numbered in increasing order from bottom to top (so the bottom wafer is wafer number 1,\nthe next wafer up is wafer number 2, etc.)."),(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"8  Internal  Horizontal  Dimensions  \u2014  Figure  2  shows  a  cross-section  of  the  horizontal  boundaries  of  the  FOSB\nside domains (which contain the parts of the FOSB higher than z6 above the horizontal datum plane and lower than\nz15  above  the  top  wafer).
