An SV may not be changed by the host but may be changed by\nthe equipment or operator.  The value of status variables may be queried by the host at anytime using the S1,F3/4 or\nS6,F19/20 transactions.\n6. 3.4    DVVALs  are  variables  that  are  valid  only  upon  the  occurrence  of  specific  collection  events.

In  Table  5,  the  subscript  \u201cv\u201d  is  used  to  denote  the  number  of  virtual  testers,  \u201ch\u201d  is  used  to  denote  the\nnumber  of  tester  heads,  \u201cs\u201d  to  denote  the  number  of  tester  head  sites,  and  \u201cb\u201d  to  denote  the  number  of  bins  or\nclasses.\n6. 3.6  class, hard-bin, and soft-bin \u2014 Equipment is to maintain DVVALs which provide three levels of granularity\nfor  test  results:  class,  hard-bin,  and  soft-bin.  Classes,  hard-bins,  and  soft-bins  are  expected  to  be  defined  within  a\nprocess program, and their names are made available as DVVALs. When device testing has completed, the process\nprogram  is  to  determine  the  class,  hard-bin,  and  soft-bin  with  which  the  device  is  to  be  associated,  based  on  the\nresults of the testing. Finally, a summation of the number of devices associated with each class, hard-bin, and soft-\nbin  is  also  maintained  throughout  the  execution  of  a  process  program,  and  these  are  also  made  available  as\nDVVALs.\n6. 4    For  multiple  sites  scenarios,  if  a  variable  is  described  as  List  by  number  of  sites,  then  a  list  is  expected,  one\nvalue for each site.\nTable 5  Variable Item Mapping Table\nVariable Name Description SECS-II Type Class Comments\nActiveSites List of test-sites that are to be tested.

The HSEM also requires that the process\nprogram  have  a  structure  that  enables  the  user  to  build\nprocess  programs  with  default  conditions  that  can  be\noverridden for a run.  The concepts of process program\nstructure  and  process  program  variable  parameters  are\ndiscussed  in  the  following  sections.    The  HSEM  also\nrequires the following:\n\u2022 Minimum, maximum, and default parameter values\nmust be defined for all process programs.\n\u2022 Verification  will  occur  when  a  process  program  is\ndownloaded  to  the  equipment;  the  program  syntax\nmust be verified by the equipment manufacturer.\n\u2022 Parameter  validation  will  occur  when  a  process\nprogram  is  downloaded.  Parameters  must  be  type\nand range checked.\n\u2022 Equipment   should   provide   the   functionality   to\nmanually or interactively modify the parameters set\nin the process program.\n\u2022 An  error  message  must  be  generated  from  the\nhandler   if   the   process   program   parameters   are\noutside the range of the machine calibration.\n9. 2  Process Program Structure\n9. 2.1      A   handler   process   program   must   contain   the\nfollowing information:\n\u2022 Machine-specific configuration parameters,\n\u2022 Process-Site-specific information section,\n\u2022 Media-Type-specific information section, and\n\u2022 Unit (Unit/Package) information section.\n9. 2.2    When  combined,  this  information  constitutes  a\ncomplete  process  program.  It  is  emphasized  that  the\nHSEM does not enforce the exact format and data type\nof  each  section.  However,  it  does  provide  direction  as\nto what each section should consist of.\n9. 2.3  Machine-Specific  Configuration  Parameters  \u2014\nEach  brand  or  type  of  handler  may  have  one  or  more\nmachine-specific  configuration  parameters.  Examples\nof   such   parameters   would   be   input   configuration,\nnumber of process-sites, and output configuration. Even\nthough   they   are   supplier-specific,   these   parameters\nnevertheless  play  a  vital  role  in  the  overall  generation\nor  creation  of  a  process  program.

The  newly  generated\nprocess  program  then  is  downloaded  onto  a  specific\nhandler,  verified,  and  is  now  ready  to  be  selected  and\nexecuted locally by the operator or remotely by the host\ncomputer. If this process is used, the supplied software\ntools should closely mimic or simulate a handler so that\na user can create a complete process program.

The following\nminimum information is required:\nvariable name   Class: <ECV, SV, or DVVAL>  Format: SML\nDescription: If class = DVVAL, description must contain statement of when data is valid.\nIf format = ASCII, then a length is required. It is assumed to be left-justified unless otherwise noted.\n6. 2  Data Types\n6. 2.1  Equipment Constants (ECVs) can be changed by the host using S2,F15 (New Equipment Constant Send). The\noperator may be able to change some values, but the equipment does not change the values on its own.  The value of\nan equipment constant may be queried by the host at any time, using the S2,F13/14 transaction. They reside in non-\nvolatile memory of the equipment.  Equipment constants remain in effect until they are overwritten either by manual\nentry or by a S2,F15.\n6. 2.2  Status Variables (SVs) are valid at all times.  An SV may not be changed by the host but may be changed by\nthe equipment or operator.  The value of status variables may be queried by the host at anytime using the S1,F3/4 or\nS6,F19/20 transactions.\n6. 2.3   DVVALs are variables that are valid only upon the occurrence of specific collection events.  An attempt to\nread  a  variable  item  at  the  wrong  time  does  not  generate  an  error,  but  the  data  reported  may  not  have  relevant\nmeaning.\n6. 3    For  multiple  sites  scenarios,  if  a  variable  is  described  as  List  by  number  of  sites,  then  a  list  is  expected,  one\nvalue for each site.\nTable 4  Variable Item Mapping Table\nVariable Name Description                                              Class                                              SECS-II                                              Type\nPhysical Handler Group\nBufferID Identifier of the buffer.
