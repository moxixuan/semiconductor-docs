It provides references toother sections of the standard where detailedrequirements are located. This section also definesstandard terminology and documentation that can beused by equipment suppliers and device manufacturersto describe compliance with this standard.The GEM standard contains two types of specifications: fundamental GEM requirements and requirements pertaining to additional GEMcapabilities.The fundamental GEM requirements form thefoundation of the GEM standard. The additional GEMcapabilities provide functionality required for sometypes of factory automation or functionality applicableto specific types of equipment. Figure 8.1 illustrates therelationship of the fundamental GEM requirements andthe additional GEM capabilities. 8.1 Fundamental GEM Requirements  Allequipment shall comply with the fundamental GEMrequirements listed in Table 8.1.

Equipment is GEM-compliantfor a specific GEM capability if, and only if, thefollowing three criteria are met: The fundamental GEM requirements are satisfied. The capability is implemented to conform with allapplicable definitions, descriptions, andrequirements defined for the capability in thisstandard. The equipment does not exhibit behavior related tothis capability that conflicts with the GEM behaviordefined for the capability.For example, equipment that provides SECS-IImessages for management of process programs mustprecisely implement the GEM Process ProgramManagement capability to be GEM-Compliant forProcess Program Management.Equipment may supply additional functionality notspecified in the GEM standard by using any messagesdefined in the SECS-II standard as long as theadditional functionality does not conflict withcompliance to GEM capabilities.Figure 8.2 illustrates the host view of equipmentcommunications in relationship to the components ofthe GEM standard. The GEM capabilities are built uponthe fundamental GEM requirements and present GEM-compliant behavior to the host when they are notobstructed by conflicting functionality. Additional non-GEM capabilities and non-obstructing extensions toGEM capabilities provide additional functionality whilemaintaining GEM behavior from the host view.One additional term is defined to facilitate discussion ofGEM capability. Equipment is Fully GEM Capable ifand only if it meets the following two criteria: The equipment supplies all the GEM capabilitieslisted in Section 8.2.  Every implemented GEM capability is GEM-Compliant. 8.4 Documentation  This section describesdocumentation requirements in addition to thosespecified in Sections 3 and 4 of this standard.

Application NotesNOTE: The material contained in these ApplicationNotes is not an official part of this SEMI standard andis not intended to modify or supersede the officialstandard. Rather, these notes are auxiliary informationdescribing possible methods for implementing theprotocol described by the standard and are included asreference material. The standard should be referred toin all cases. SEMI makes no warranties orrepresentations as to the suitability of the material setforth herein for any particular application. Thedetermination of the suitability of the materialis solelythe responsibility of the user. A.1 Factory Operational ScriptAn Operational Script is a series of capabilitiesarranged in a typical factory operation sequence. Theintent of having an Operational Script is to help put theSECS-II message Scenarios into a context. Althoughthis context will vary, it represents a typical operationalsequence found in most semiconductor devicemanufacturers applications. System Initialization Synchronization Machine Setup Production Setup Processing Post-Processing ShutdownThe following script is not intended to be complete, butto serve as an example to be further developed on animplementation basis. A1.1 Anytime Capabilities  All capabilities cangenerally occur at anytime during the operational scriptsequence.A1.2 System Initialization and Synchronization Upon system initialization, the default setting forcommunication (enabled or disabled) becomeseffective, as well as any equipment constants or otherinformation retained in non-volatile storage. The initialcommunication status is displayed at the equipment.Assuming the communication state is enabled, theequipment will attempt to establish communicationwith a host computer. See Section 4.1 for a descriptionof the scenario for establishing communications.Upon receiving an indication that the equipment waspreviously not communicating, the host would typically perform synchronization activities including setting theequipments clock and requesting selected statusinformation. Note that synchronization activity is hostapplication-dependent and may be implemented usingvarious scenarios. A1.3 Production Set-Up  The host typically has thefollowing information: what material what process step what process program to use (PPID) current equipment status, VIDs, SVIDs data collection requirements (trace data & eventdata) VIDs needed Equipment constants (ECIDs)Based upon the above information, the host willperform setup activities as required. It must be verifiedthat the correct process program is available andselected at the equipment. A1.3.1 Auxiliary Material and Manual Set-Up Auxiliary material can be checked and verified at thispoint. If status variables exist for auxiliary material,they may be requested by the host.Any other manual, non-process, and/or non-productspecific set-up also may take place at this point. Theoperator may interact with the equipment and the host.If the operator interacts with the equipment, theequipment communications link with the host shouldstay operational.The operator and the host may exchange informationvia equipment terminal services. A1.3.2 Product/Process Set-Up  Specific productand/or process information is communicated to theequipment prior to processing material.A1.3.3 Material Load  The host may instruct anoperator or a material handling system to delivermaterial to the equipment.Once the material has arrived at the equipment, theequipment or the operator will notify the host. A1.3.4 Production Data Collection Set-Up  The hostinstructs the equipment to collect event-based data.Reports are defined and linked to events. Event reportscan be enabled or disabled.The host instructs the equipment to collect data fromthe equipment based on time intervals."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 10 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E30-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1992, 2003 84 The host configures the equipment to monitor specificvariables and to send event reports when variablestransition between monitoring zones. A1.4 ProcessingA1.4.1 Start Process Executing  The host oroperator issues a command to start.A1.4.2 Equipment Signals End of Run  Whenprocess execution is completed, the equipmentgenerates events. If any of the events are enabled, theywill be sent as event reports.A1.5 Post-Processing  The equipment hascompleted processing material. It now makes thematerial available to the operator or material handlingsystem for removal. The equipment signals the host thatit is available for more work.A1.5.1 Material Unload  Material is unloaded fromthe equipment by an operator or material handlingsystem. A.2 Equipment Front PanelIn the GEM standard, several requirements are statedthat involve the display or input of information at theequipment front panel. The equipment front panelrefers to an area on the equipment that is available tothe operator under normal use (i.e., without removingmaintenance access panels). This may include a CRTdisplay, keyboard, switches, and lights.This application note provides some guidance forimplementation of the GEM front panel capabilities. Allof these requirements map directly to state models andcapabilities defined in Sections 3 and 4. All capabilitiesmay be implemented in either hardware (buttons,switches, lights) or in a software/CRT equivalent. A2.1 Displays and Indicators  The intent of variousdisplays is to inform the operator of either the currentstate of the equipment or of a recent change of state (orboth). Therefore, it is most useful if these displays arecontinuously visible and easily recognized at a distance.Required displays/indicators include:Communications State: This means that three distinctstates must be represented: DISABLED,ENABLED/NOT COMMUNICATING, andENABLED/COMMUNICATING.Terminal Services: An New Host Message indicatormust be supplied. A2.2 Switches/Buttons  Note that discrete switchesalso contain information for the user. However, these tend to represent the desired states of the operator/user.The equipments response to a change of a switch maynot be instantaneous. Still, the current position ofswitches should be available to the operator.It may be appropriate to limit the access to someswitches and buttons. This might be done via any of thestandard methods, keys, passwords, combinations, etc.This is especially true for system default switches thatwould not often be changed. Required switches/buttonsinclude:Communications State System Default: In whatcommunications state should the equipment be whensystem initialization is complete? The choices areDISABLED and ENABLED.Communications State Selector: This is a toggle orbutton that will initiate a transition from ENABLED toDISABLED or vice versa.Message Recognition Button: This button is used toinitiate an event message to the host which indicatesthat the New Host Message has been read. Thisbutton should function only when the New HostMessage Indicator is activated and when the receivedmessage is displayed in the terminal display. A.3 Examples of Equipment AlarmsTable A.3 provides alarm examples pertaining tovarious configurational aspects of equipment.NOTE: It is important to stress that these are justexamples intended to illustrate that alarms pertain tosituations in which there exists a potential forexceeding physical safety limits associated with people,equipment, and material being processed as per theGEM definition of an alarm.NOTE: The alarm capability is intended as an additionto standard safety alarms (e.g., lights, horns).

What follows is a verybrief description of the symbols defined for use andhow these are useful to describe a system. See FigureA.5.1 for the basic notational symbols. Figure A.5.1Harel Statechart Symbols States are represented by rounded boxes. A statetransition is shown graphically with a line from the oldstate terminating with the arrow symbol at the newstate. Transitions are unidirectional-while the reversetransition may be possible, it is considered a differenttransition with different conditions for initiation anddifferent resultant actions.States may be subdivided into substates to facilitatemore concise definition of behavior. Thus, a hierarchyis defined whereby any state may be a substate of someparent state and in turn be the parent of its ownsubstates. Substates must be one of two types, termedAND substates and OR substates. A parent maybe divided into two or more OR substatesof which one and only one is the active substate at anytime. The accepted term for this exclusivity is XOR.Figure A.5.2 gives an example of a simple case of ORsubstates. In this example, some system (perhaps amotor) has a state named FUNCTIONAL. When themotor is FUNCTIONAL, it may be either ON or OFF,but never both. Figure A.5.2Example of OR Substates Another way of dividing a parent state correspondsroughly to subsystems. These AND substates representparallelism, such that every AND substate of an activeparent state is considered active. Harel also uses theterm Orthogonal Component to refer to ANDsubstates. However, these parallel substates tend to behighly interactive and interdependent. For this reason,the word orthogonal is considered confusing and hasbeen excluded from use in this document. Figure A.5.3shows an example of AND substates representing (inpart) an automobile. Note the convention of attachingthe name of the parent state AUTOMOBILE to theoutside of the state in a small box. The substates shownare independent components and may have their ownsubstates (of either the AND or OR type): LIGHTS may be ON or OFF; DOOR may be OPEN or CLOSED; ENGINE is constructed of components such aspumps, pistons, carburetor, etc.Exiting one of a set of AND substates requires the exitof all others. In some cases, a transition arrow will beshown from only one of the substates with the othersimplied."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 13 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E30-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1992, 200387 Figure A.5.3Example of AND Substates A simplification that also helps to prevent indeterminacy is implemented with the symbol for defaultentry point. This symbol will indicate which ORsubstate is initially active when there is not an explicitchoice. This lack of specification is indicated by atransition arrow from one state to another that does notcross the boundary of the parent to point specifically toa substate.An entrance to a state terminating in a history symbol(see Figure A.5.1) indicates that the OR substate to beentered should be that which was active the last timethe parent state was active (i.e., last time the car wasrunning, the radio was on). The history symbol H refersto the choice of substates of the parent. The symbol H","*","extends further to the lowest level substates defined. Inthe absence of memory of a last time, the defaultentry is used.The selector and conditional selector symbols serve toabbreviate complex entrances to states. Their meaningis similar and indicate that the choice of OR substateupon entry of a parent state depends on some conditionthat is not shown. The selector is usually used tocombine several similar transition events, while theconditional selector will typically require somecomputation or test of conditions external to thestimulus for state transition. Please examine thereferenced article for more detail.NOTE: Within the body of this document, theterm statechart is not used in favor of the moretraditional term state diagram. A5.1 State Definitions  The state diagram provides aconcise description of the function of a system.However, a full definition requires detail that cannot be included on the diagram. A description of each state isrequired that covers the boundaries of the state and anyresponses that occur within that state to theenvironment. The convention in this document is toprovide state names in ALL CAPS to help the readeridentify where these are used. A sample statedescription of the ON state depicted in the Figure A.5.2might be:ONThe switch is in the on position. Power is available tothe motor. Speed of the motor will change in proportionto the speed knob adjustment. A5.2 Transition Table  The last piece of the statemodel is the transition table. It consists of severalcolumns that list the transition number from thediagram, the starting and ending state for the transition,and three columns titled trigger, action, and comment.The trigger column describes the combination of eventsand conditions that initiates the transition (e.g., messageSx,Fy received). The trigger should be related to asingle clearly defined event at the equipment. Theaction column identifies the activities associateddirectly with the transition. These activities may be ofthree types: a) actions taken upon exit of the old state,b) actions taken upon entry to the new state, and c)actions not associated with either state. These are notdifferentiated in this document. The final columnallows for additional comments that help to clarify thetransition.

A hostsystem must have a view of the control model tounderstand and predict equipment behavior. However,the implementor may simplify the hosts view byassuming that some configuration settings are fixed andthat the host-initiated features are not implemented.Applying these assumptions simplifies the behavior thehost expects to see."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 14 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E30-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1992, 2003 88 Figure A.6.1 shows the effective control model24 basedon the following host assumptions: The fundamental requirements are met, but theadditional host-intiated control capability is notimplemented. The configuration for the default entry toCONTROL is set to an OFF-LINE substate (eitherATTEMPT ON-LINE or EQUIPMENT OFF-LINE). The destination state for transition 4 (failure ofS1,F1 transaction) is configured to EQUIPMENTOFF-LINE. Figure A.6.1Example of the Simplified Effective ControlModel This view of the model has two further settings that thehost recognizes as changeable at the equipment. Thefirst is the configuration of which substate of OFF- 24 See Section 3.3 for details of the control model. LINE to be activated upon system initialization. Thesecond is the front panel switch that determineswhether the active system substate is LOCAL orREMOTE when ON-LINE.This application has the following implications: This application requires that the equipment beginwith the OFF-LINE state active. Thus, anequipment initiated S1,F1/F2 transaction must becompleted before the equipment will begin sendingall messages to the host. If a failed attempt to go ON-LINE is made by theequipment, it will not allow the host to completethe transition at a later time. An operator will berequired to re-initiate the transition to ON-LINEwhen the host becomes ready. Once ON-LINE, the equipment will remain ON-LINE until an operator sets the equipment OFF-LINE at the equipment front panel. Since all transitions into the HOST OFF-LINEstate are eliminated, this state is effectivelyeliminated from the host view of the control model.This application retains the following features: The ON-LINE state is achieved only after the hostacknowledges the equipment by replying to theS1,F1 with and S1,F2. This confirms to theoperator attempting to put the equipment ON-LINEthat the host application is ready for work to begin. It provides the operator the means to set theequipment OFF-LINE for non-host-relatedactivities25 (e.g., maintenance, test lots). The operator has the ability to operate theequipment with either the REMOTE or LOCALstate active. As the equipment transitions to ON-LINE, the preferred substate is automaticallychosen (based on a front panel switch). The user may configure which substate of OFF-LINE the equipment will initially activate atsystem initialization. If ATTEMPT ON-LINE ischosen, the equipment will automatically attemptthe transition to the ON-LINE state as systeminitialization. 25 Which activities are non-host-related varies from factory tofactory. In general, fewer activities are non-host-related as afactorys automation level increases."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 15 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E30-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1992, 200389 A.7 Examples of Limits MonitoringA7.1 IntroductionA7.1.1 Four limits monitoring examples are includedbelow to help clarify the use of limits and to illustratetypical applications. The first example shows how toapply limits to boolean values. The second illustratesapplication of several limits to a floating point variablein a classical control zone style. The third exampleshows an integer counter variable used to prompt forequipment maintenance.A7.2 ExamplesA7.2.1 Example 1  Valve MonitoringA7.2.1.1 The ACME Shine-Um-Rite Model 13includes a sump which contains the chemical agentused to clean bare wafers. A chemical feeder systemserves to refill the sump when the level drops below acertain level. The fill is accomplished via an on-offvalue driven by sensors in the sump. Facilities must beinformed of the proportion of the time the valve is open(approximates usage) and any time the value remainsopen for more than 5 minutes (valve likely broken).A7.2.1.2 To implement this requirement, a limit wasdefined for the Boolean status variable which containsthe current state of the valve (i.e., 0 = Closed, 1 =Open). See Figure A7.1 for illustration. LIMITID1 wasdefined with UPPERDB = LIMITMAX = 1 (Open) andLOWERDB = LIMITMIN = 0 (Closed). As a result,any time the valve opens, a collection event isgenerated with TransitionType = 0 and when the valvecloses, a collection event is generated withTransitionType = 1. An event report containing theDVVAL LimitVariable was attached to each collectionevent and reporting for the event was enabled.NOTE: Boolean values are defined as 0 =False/Closed/Off and any value ",">"," 0 = True/Open/On never depend on a value of 1. Figure A7.1Valve Monitoring Example A7.2.2 Example 2  Environment MonitoringA7.2.2.1 ACME also makes a Model 2 Stepper. Theenvironmental control system of this equipment is designed to hold the internal temperature relativelyconstant, but is sensitive to large changes in theexternal environment, opening of access doors, etc. Toensure that processing conditions are appropriate, theinternal stepper temperature is monitored to ensure itremains in a safe operating zone (within Shutdownlimits). In addition, a second set of limits are usedwithin the Shutdown limits to bound the Normaloperating range. Frequent excursions from the normalrange into the warning range will prompt service onthe environmental control system. The targettemperature range is specified as 98100\xb0, theshutdown limits as 95103\xb0.A7.2.2.2 Event reports are desired when the internaltemperature moves outside of the normal operatingzone into a warning zone (above or below), when thetemperature moves back into the normal operating zonefrom the warning zones, and when the temperaturemoves out of the warning zones into the shutdownzones. Furthermore, temperature fluctuations of 0.5\xb0should not trigger multiple event reports.A7.2.2.3 Probably the most intuitive use of the limitsmonitoring capability is in establishing normal,warning, and shutdown zones for a particularequipment variable. Limits may be combined to providesuch a scenario. The method is described below andillustrated in Figure A7.2. Please note that in the figure,limits are denoted as solid lines for simplicity, withdeadbands indicated using the \xb1 notation. Figure A7.2Environment Monitoring Example A7.2.3 Example 3  Calibration CounterA7.2.3.1 Another ACME equipment is the multi-chamber Duz-It-All Model 7.

Oneparticular chamber on this equipment requires periodic"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 16 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E30-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1992, 2003 90 calibration. The need for calibration is a non-linearfunction of the number of wafers processed in thatchamber. A status variable exists which contains thenumber of wafers processed since the last calibrationwas performed. Maintenance is definitely required afterevery 8 cycles, but the machine must be checked after 5and 7 cycles to determine whether early calibration isnecessary. This checking may be done by examiningcertain other equipment status variables.A7.2.3.2 To meet this need, three limits are defined forthe counter variable. Three limits were set, at 5, 7, and8. Deadbands are set to zero, since chattering is not aproblem. All the pertinent information is placed in anevent report which is attached to the CEID for thelimits of the counter to negate the need for furthermessage exchange. Event reports are generated as eachlimit is reached (one zone transition each), and whenthe counter is reset following calibration (one, two, orthree zone transitions referenced in one report). FigureA7.3 illustrates this example. Note that disabling thereport upon counter reset (downward transitions) is notpossible. Figure A7.3Calibration Counter ExampleA7.2.4 Example 4  Derived VariablesA7.2.4.1 The flagship of the ACME line is the newHotDog Furnace. This is a vertical furnace whichexposes wafers to a variety of temperatures duringprocessing. The temperature profile during the run iscritical to the process and is typically contains a numberof plateaus at different levels during the run. Theowner wishes to monitor the temperature and be alertedwhenever the actual temperature profile differs from theideal by ",">"," 0.5\xb0. The derived variable was created toprovide a steady target range during the run, no matterwhat the desired temperature range happened to be.Deviation from ideal temperature profile was chosenas the new variable to be monitored. The equipmentalready had access to the profile for the run, whichdescribed the desired temperature at a given time intothe process. The manufacturer added a calculation eachtime the actual temperature was sampled, subtractingthe ideal temperature from the actual. They provided asstatus variables the actual temperature, the idealtemperature, and the new deviation from profilevariable. One limit was activated and set to 0.5 degrees and a second set to 0.5 degrees (each with a deadbandwidth of 0.05). Thus, when the temperature deviationfrom setpoint exceeds \xb1 0.5, an event is generatedcontaining the current desired temperature and theactual temperature. For good measure, additional datawas added, providing time since start of run todocument the precise point in the process that theproblem occurred.A7.2.4.2 In order to achieve the desired behavior, thehost defines four monitoring limits. Two of the limitsestablish the target zone. These are responsible forreporting transitions from normal to warning zones ineither direction. The other two limits establish thetransitions between the warning zones and the errorzones. The difference between UPPERDB andLOWERDB for each limit is 0.5. This may also beexpressed as limit \xb1 0.25. Combining limits does notchange the way the equipment treats limits monitoring,but rather builds a method of interpreting limits fromthe hosts point of view. A.8 Process Parameter Modification forProcess and Equipment ControlA8.1 IntroductionA8.1.1 In many equipment control applications there isa need for a GEM host to modify one or a small set ofprocess parameters associated with a recipe. Thenumber of parameters modified, frequency ofmodification (e.g., wafer-to-wafer, batch-to-batch, etc.),range of modification, etc., is largely a function of theequipment control application. Utilizing GEM, at leasttwo methods are envisioned for modifying processparameters on a tool. With the first method,Equipment Constants can be used to relate processparameters of the updated recipe. Equipment Constantscan also be used in a mode where they relate suggestedmodifications to process parameters from the storedrecipe, i.e., the constants contain only the +/-differential from a nominal value. The former mode ispreferred because it better ensures data integritybetween the controller and tool. With the secondmethod the entire recipe could be downloaded, but thisresults in an enormous amount of communicationoverhead. Note that, in all cases, the EquipmentConstants do not replace the process parameters insidea recipe, but are associated with (e.g., linked to) theseparameters to relate modifications. The remainder ofthis application note provides a description of howprocess parameter modification can be implementedusing existing GEM capabilities. The method may beused in a GEM compliant system provided that thespecific GEM capabilities described are supported."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 17 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E30-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1992, 200391 A8.2 Equipment ConstantsA8.2.1 Incremental process parameter modification forprocess and equipment control can be supported over aGEM interface by using the Equipment Constants GEMcapability (see Section 4.5). With this capability, eachprocess parameter (or process parameter at a step) thatcan be modified, e.g., for purposes of process control,is associated with an equipment constant. Using theEquipment Constant GEM scenarios (see Section 4.5.5)the host can (1), send process parameters or parametermodifications, (2), request current values of modifiablerecipe parameters, (3), retrieve name lists of equipmentconstants associated with modifiable parameters, and(4), be informed by the equipment when an operatorchanges one of the modifiable process parameters.A8.2.2 The equipment constants should represent theactual values of the process parameters with which theyare associated. Depending on the equipment operationand control application, the equipment constant couldrepresent the actual value of a process parameter at arecipe step, or over the entire recipe. The equipmentconstants could also be utilized to represent thedifferentials of process parameters from nominalvalues. However it is important to note that, whenusing differential values to relate process parametermodifications, any loss of synchronization betweenequipment and host could result in an incorrectassessment of the value of a process setpoint by thehost. Note also that, upon system startup, and wheneverthe appropriate process parameters are modified, theequipment constants should also be modified asnecessary to always reflect the (absolute or relative)values of the associated process parameters.A8.2.3 In order to maintain synchronization betweenequipment and host, it is recommended that equipmentconstants associated with recipe parameters be appliedto only override the currently selected and active recipe.A selected recipe is considered to be active wheneverthe equipment is in the PROCESSING state and therecipe is the currently selected recipe (processprogram). If multiple recipes are utilized during oneprocess event, e.g., cluster tool scenario, it isrecommended that separate equipment constants beutilized for each recipe/process parameter pair. A8.2.4 Note that timing and traceability issuesassociated with utilizing the equipment constantscapability (for process control) are application specificand beyond the scope of this application note.Equipment that provides for recipe parameter overridesthough setting of Equipment Contstants should alsoprovide additional Equipment Constants for the set thatincludes the name of the associated process programand a Boolean variable to enable and disable theoverride feature. In addition, the supplier shoulddocument for each parameter: (1), the associatedEquipment Constant, and (2), any restrictions on thestate (active or not) or the recipe in which the parametermay be modified. Also, since override of the processsetpoints may be provided by a Host controllerapplication element, it is recommended that theequipment provide an event report whenever theassociated recipe has been modified.A8.3 ExampleA8.3.1 In the example of Figure A.8.1, a Chemical-Mechanical Planarizer (CMP) single wafer polishingsystem includes a GEM compliant planarizer(equipment), a thickness metrology unit and a (host)controller. The tool polishes a wafer to a targetthickness. The post-process thickness is measured bythe metrology unit and reported to the host controller.The controller utilizes a feedback control algorithm todetermine the appropriate polish time recipeparameter for the next wafer. This time should bereported to the CMP equipment utilizing theequipments GEM interface so that the information canbe utilized for the next wafer processing event.A8.3.2 The mechanism described in this applicationnote could be utilized to implement process control asfollows. A settable equipment constant is associated orlinked with the time parameter on the equipment.Equipment system documentation indicates the linkageand the conditions under which the linkage is valid.When the controller determines an appropriate timeparameter value for the next wafer to be polished, it setsthe equipment constant to this value (see Section 4.5).The equipment is configured to accept this equipmentconstant change and, if the equipment is in (or possiblywhen the equipment reaches) the appropriate state, therecipe parameter is modified."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 18 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E30-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1992, 2003 92 GEM Host CMPEquipment(GEM Compliant) ThicknessMetrology Post-process ThicknessMeasurementEquipment ConstantSend: Time Recipe Parameter Figure A.8.1CMP Single Wafer Polishing System with Host Recipe Parameter Modification Capability NOTICE: These standards do not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with their use.

Originally published June 1998. 1 Purpose1.1 This standard establishes a Spe cific EquipmentModel (SEM) for Inspection and Review Equipment(ISEM). The model consists of equipmentcharacteristics and behavior that are to be implementedin addition to the SEMI E30 fundamental requirementsand additional capabilities. The intent of this standard isto facilitate the integration of ISEM equipment into anautomated (semiconductor fabrication) factory. Thisdocument accomplishes this by defining an operationalmodel for ISEM equipment as viewed by a factoryautomation controller. This definition provides astandard host interface and equipment operationalbehavior (e.g., control, state models, data reports, andreporting levels). Several topics require additionalactivity that are within the scope of this standard:substrate pattern maps; defect classification codemanagement; and review data management. 2 Scope2.1 The scope of this standard is li mited to thedefinition of Inspection, Review, and Inspection/Review equipment behavior as perceived by a SEMIEquipment Communications Standard II (SEMIE5/SECS-II) host that complies with SEMI E30. Itdefines the external view of the equipment through theSECS link; it does not define the internal operation ofthe equipment. This standard expands the SEMI E30requirements and capabilities in the areas of theprocessing state model, remote commands, variableitems, alarms, and data collection.2.2 This standard is intended for IS EM equipment thatgenerates data and information about anomalies anddefects found on substrates. Inspection equipment findsanomalies. Anomalies are occurrences on a substratethat have been judged to be unexpected, abnormal,incongruous, or inconsistent. Anomalies may beexamined using review equipment, at which time theymay be classified as defects or non-defects. Someinspection equipment may generate, and some reviewequipment may use, coordinate data to locate anomalieson a substrate. The accuracy of the coordinate datagenerated or used is equipment-dependent. 2.3 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This document addresses three distinct types ofequipment: inspection, review, and inspection/review.The term ISEM equipment refers to all three types ofequipment. These three equipment types aredifferentiated by the basic functions they perform:3.1.1 Inspection Equipment that loo ks for anomalieson a substrate and reports information regarding thoseanomalies. Inspection equipment may determine thelocation of anomalies relative to a coordinate system.Inspection equipment may also provide other types ofdata related to the anomaly.3.1.2 Review Equipment that accept s informationabout anomalies on a substrate, gathers information onthose anomalies, and reports that data.3.1.3 Inspection/Review Equipment having thecharacteristics of both inspection and reviewequipment. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E5  SEMI Equipment CommunicationsStandard 2 Message Content (SECS-II)SEMI E30  Generic Model for Communications andControl of SEMI Equipment (GEM)SEMI E37  High-Speed SECS Message Services(HSMS) Generic ServicesSEMI E37.1  High-Speed SECS Message ServicesSingle-Session Mode (HSMS-SS)SEMI E58  Automated Reliability, Availability, andMaintainability Standard (ARAMS): Concepts,Behavior, and ServicesSEMI M20  Specification for Establishing a WaferCoordinate SystemSEMI M21  Specification for Assigning Addresses toRectangular Elements in a Cartesian Array"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 29 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI 30.1-0200 \xa9 SEMI 1998, 2000 4 4.2 Other ReferencesHarel, D., Statecharts: A Visual Formalism forComplex Systems, Science of Computer Programming8, (1987), 231-274NOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 5 Terminology5.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms5.1.1 GEM  generic equipment m odel5.1.2 PE  pattern element5.1.3 TCP/IP  Transmission Com municationProtocol/Internet Protocol5.2 Definitions5.2.1 align  to put into proper rela tive position ororientation.5.2.2 alignment  a procedure in which a coordinatesystem is established on a substrate.5.2.3 alignment mark  a feature on the substrateselectively used for alignment.5.2.4 anomaly  an occurrence on a substrate that hasbeen judged to be unexpected.

It is a minimum requirement to supportSingle Session (SEMI E37.1/HSMS-SS) sendingSECS-II messages over TCP/IP. The reason behind thisrequirement is the size of the process programs used bythis class of equipment and the amount of dataproduced. 7 State Models7.1 Processing State Model Requi rements7.1.1 The processing state model inc luded in thisstandard is a requirement for ISEM equipment. Thisstandard requires implementation of all SEMI E30 statemodels (such as control, communication, and on-line/off-line). A state model consists of state modeldiagrams, state definitions, and a state transition table.All state transitions in this standard, unless otherwisespecified, shall correspond to collection events.7.1.2 A state model is the hosts vie w of theequipment and does not necessarily describe theinternal equipment operation. All ISEM state modeltransitions shall be mapped sequentially into theappropriate internal equipment events that satisfy therequirements of those transitions. In certainimplementations, the equipment may enter a state andhave already satisfied all of the conditions required bythe ISEM state model for transition to another state.The equipment makes the required transition withoutany additional actions in this situation.7.1.3 Some equipment may need to include additionalstates other than those in this standard. Additional statesmay be added but shall not change the ISEM-definedstate transitions. All expected transitions between ISEMstates shall occur.7.2 Processing State Model Diagr am  Processingstate models are detailed for ISEM equipment in Figure1.

The host canuse the report definition scenario defined in SEMI E30 to define reports at ISEM-defined levels. The intent of thissection is to ensure data is available at specific events and to optimize data reporting to the SECS-II host byallowing data to be grouped at reporting levels. 8.1 Requirements8.1.1 This standard requires all colle ction events listed in the SEMI E30 standard. This standard requires the ISEMevents in Table 2 for data collection (RunDataComplete, SubstrateDataComplete, GroupDataComplete,RegionDataComplete, and AnomalyDataComplete). These events are separate from the processing state transitions.These collection events shall occur before or on the processing state transition specified in Table 1. This was done to"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 38 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI 30.1-0200 \xa9 SEMI 1998, 200013 ensure that the data and the material remain synchronous. As a result, in some cases material processing may bedelayed due to extended data processing time.8.1.2 The most fundamental level of data defined for ISEM equipment is the anomaly level for review equipmentand region level for inspection equipment. For example, review equipment has data available for individualanomalies at the AnomalyDataComplete event. Anomaly data may be grouped for level reporting. For example, datafor anomalies found within a region on a substrate would be available at the RegionDataComplete event. This datawould be available as a list variable item for Region Anomalies. All anomalies found on a substrate would beavailable at the SubstrateDataComplete event. This could either be 1) a list of list variable items for RegionAnomaly, or 2) a single list variable item of all Substrate Anomalies. In this way, data can be reported with lesshigh-level event reports, rather than as more low-level event reports.8.1.3 Data produced by ISEM equip ment is customarily grouped for reporting by processing, material, andequipment constraints which are called reporting levels (i.e., run, substrate, group, site, and anomaly data). Leveldata is grouped by these constraints for a reporting level. Data shall be grouped within a reporting level according toother constraints by degree of processing (e.g., raw sensor, basic, or analyzed data), or statistically (e.g., summary,correlation, or comparison).

Thesevariable items are separated into three categories: (a) common to all ISEM equipment; (b) specific to inspectionequipment; (c) and specific to review equipment.If equipment supports the data item functionality defined by ISEM, then it is required and shall be implemented asspecified in Table 4 Variable Item Dictionary. That is, a variable item is only required if the equipment supportsthe functionality necessary to support it. For example, if an inspection instrument only has the hardware to countdetected anomalies and lacks the hardware to determine their size, then the ISEM requires it to report anomaly count(e.g., as SubstrateAnomalyCount), but reporting anomaly size (as AnomalySize) is not required by the ISEM. 9.1 Requirements All variable items and data item restrictions defined in SEMI E30 are required on ISEM equipment. All variable items in the ISEM Variable Item Dictionary for specific equipment classifications are required forISEM equipment. The data item restrictions are also required.9.1.1 Variable items are categorized in the Variable Item Dictionary as follows: Common Variables (CV)  variables common to all ISEM equipment. Inspection-Specific Variables (ISV)  variables required only for inspection equipment.

It alsoindicates when the variable item is valid.Class: The data type of the item.Format: acceptable formats are SEMI E5 lists, ASCII,floating point, unsigned integer, or signed integer. A description of ANY indicates that only theabove formats are acceptable and is left to the tool vendor to decide.Comments: Any additional information pertinent to the variable name. 9.3 Variable Item Types9.3.1 Equipment Constants (ECV)  The value can be changed by the host using S2,F15. The operator may havethe ability to change some or all of the values. The value of an equipment constant may be queried at any time bythe host using the S2,F13/14 transaction or Stream 6 reports.9.3.2 Status Variables (SV)  The v alues are valid at all times. A SV may not be changed by the host or operatorbut may be changed by the equipment. A host or operator command may change an equipment status, thus changingan SV. The value of status variables may be queried by the host at any time using the S1,F3/4 or Stream 6 reports.9.3.3 Data Variables (DVVAL)  T hese are variables which are valid upon the occurrence of a specific collectionevent and which may or may not be valid at other times, depending upon the equipment. An attempt to read avariable item when it is invalid will not result in an error, but the data reported may not have relevant meaning.9.4 Variable Item Dictionary9.4.1 Data Validity  The Level column in Table 4 defines when the variable item is valid. The entry in thiscolumn corresponds to a reporting level defined in Section 9.2 Variable Items and Reporting Levels.

ISEM equipment may also be required to transferArea and Alignment Site data needed for run setup.Anomaly and review data sets (as well as area andalignment site data sets) are commonly handled as listsand tables. ISEM equipment shall use tables whentransferring this kind of data between itself and thehost. List shall be used to refer to sub-sets of this tabledata. 11.1 ISEM Table Data11.1.1 ISEM Tables are used to specif y area, align-ment site, and anomaly coordinate lists for ISEM equip-ment. ISEM Tables are transferred between the hostand the equipment using SECS-II Stream 13 messages(Unformatted Data Set Transfers). For example, anISEM Table may be used to transfer anomaly data (e.g.,M21 coordinates) generated by inspection equipmentto the host, which in turn may then be transferred toreview equipment from the host. ISEM Tables alsoinclude attributes items that are associated with thetable, not with the table data. ISEM Table attributes are used to include information associated with table data,like the number of columns (NumCols), number ofrows (NumRows), and table size (DataLength). (SeeSEMI E58 for additional information.) Product orprocess-related information may also be included on theattribute section of the ISEM Tables (e.g., LotID, Pro-ductID, OperatorID, ProcessEquipmentID) (see Table4). The ISEM does not specify additional table attributevariable items that may be associated with the table.11.2 TABLE-DEFs11.2.1 ISEM Tables are documented using TABLE-DEF structures (Figure 5). Each TABLE-DEF structurehas a unique name (TableID) and type (TableType).Each column in the TABLE-DEF has a name (e.g.,AREANAME, ALIGNNAME, OR ANOM-ALYID); row names are specific instances or valuesthat correspond to the column headers in TABLE-DEF.A specific TABLE-DEF row is designated by referringto the TABLE-DEF name and the specific row name.ISEM Tables are transferred using standard (SECS-IImessage) Stream 13 messages (Figure 6), and eachISEM-defined TABLE-DEF item maps into a Stream13 message item.

Theprocess program shall supply all of the informationrequired for a remotely executed run to be processedwithout operator intervention.12.2 Requirements12.2.1 The ISEM requires that the SE MI E30capability of Process Program Management be fullysupported for this class of equipment. ISEM requiresthat the process program have a structure that enablesthe user to build process programs with defaultconditions that can be overridden for a run. ISEMrequires the ability to vary the quantity of substratesprocessed, the alignment information used, and thenumber and/or location of the areas/anomalies to be inspected/reviewed through the uses of process programvariable parameters. The concepts of process programstructure and process program variable parameters arediscussed in the following sections.12.3 Process Program Structure12.3.1 The purpose of this process pr ogram structureand the related concepts is to provide flexibility inusing process programs to reduce the number of processprograms needed. This structure enables the user orhost to vary certain parameters of a given processprogram as needed for any particular run.12.3.2 Often a process program may be very similarfrom one run to another and may differ only in a fewparameters such as: which substrate slots to run, whichareas to inspect, which parameters to run on eachsubstrate, etc. Previously this small variation from runto run would require a large number of processprograms to be created and maintained. The flexibility"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 50 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI 30.1-0200 \xa9 SEMI 1998, 200025 of the method described in this section will reduce thenumber of process programs.12.4 Process Program Variable Pa rameters  Aprocess program parameter specifies a value thattemporarily modifies the value of a process programvariable parameter. A process program variableparameter is formally defined within a process programbody and contains (1) a variable parameter name that isunique in the body (CPNAME), and (2) a parameterdefault value for use when the process program isselected for execution without specification of anoverride value for this variable parameter(CPVAL/CPEVAL).12.4.1 Overriding Process Program V ariableParameters Default Values12.4.1.1 Any process-related informatio n that isnormally requested from the operator console in manualoperation shall have a process program variableparameter identified in the process program and defaultvalues assigned in the body of the process program. Anequipment would run the process program using thedefault values unless those values were overridden.12.4.1.2 These process program variabl e parametersallow a host to tailor a process program for a specificrun of material by temporarily modifying (replacing)the process program default values using a remotecommand of PP-UPDATE. The modification does notpermanently change the process program; themodifications remain in effect only until the next run or until the next PP-UPDATE remote command isreceived.12.4.2 Requirements and Rules12.4.2.1 ISEM equipment is required to supportvariable process program parameters. Additionally,ISEM process programs are required to contain variableprocess program parameters that specify a name foreach of the four previously defined ISEM table types.Specifically, parameters for TABLE-AREA-DEF,TABLE-ALIGN-DEF, TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF,and TABLE-M21-ANOMALY-DEF table names arerequired. Only the names that refer to these TABLE-DEFs are required to be included in the processprogram body. The actual TABLE-DEF data is externalto the process program body. The host may alwaysassume that there are variable process programparameters for these four ISEM tables.12.4.2.2 Before execution of a CARRIE RBLD canbegin, the presence of all the ISEM Tables that itreferences shall be verified by the equipment. If theyare not all present, an error shall be reported. Theequipment shall support data items that may be linkedto the event report that specifies the name of missingISEM Tables. S7,F27 is used for reporting this errorcondition.12.4.2.3 The following table summariz es the variableprocess program parameters that ISEM equipment shallsupport and the remote command parameters that thehost may use to override their values (as defined inSection 13 and Table 9).
