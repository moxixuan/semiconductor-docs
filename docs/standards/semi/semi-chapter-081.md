SEMI F47-0200 © SEMI 1999, 20005 RELATED INFORMATION 1RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELECTRICAL STANDARDS NOTE: This related information is not an official part ofSEMI F47 and is not intended to modify or supersede theofficial standard. It has been derived from the work of theoriginating task force. Determination of the suitability ofthe material is solely the responsibility of the user. R1-1 Basis for this Industry-SpecificSemiconductor StandardR1-1.1 The Information Technology IndustryCouncil (ITIC) CBEMA-curve, contained in IEEE446, IEEE 1100, and SEMI E51, was used as astarting point in establishing recommended ride-through limits. The following curve (see Figure R1-1) was developed to define voltage sag ride-throughfor use with semiconductor processing equipment.Primarily due to testing limitations, only the portionbetween 0.05 seconds (50 milliseconds) and 1.0seconds was selected for inclusion in thespecification. As future test equipment, methods, anddata are developed the specified duration limits maybe expanded. Recommended voltage sag ride-through capability limits from zero to 100 secondsare included here for reference (see Figure R1-1).While not currently included in this SEMIspecification the wider range should be consideredwhen designing equipment and selectingcomponents.R1-1.2 Over voltage conditions also covered in theITIC CBEMA-curve contained in IEEE 446, IEEE1100, and SEMI E51, are not considered in the scopeof this industry-specific specification primarily due tothe extremely low number of semiconductorequipment interruptions caused by over voltageevents. While not in the scope of this specification,over voltage conditions should not be ignored anduse of existing equipment protection techniquesshould be continued (see SEMI E51 or IEEE 446 forgeneric equipment over voltage ride-throughspecifications). R1-2 Relationship to Generic ElectricalStandardsR1-2.1 This SEMI standard is intended to becoordinated with related SEMI, IEC and IEEEstandards. The relationship of this SEMIspecification to many other standards that addressequipment immunity, test methods, and safety was considered in development of this specification. Forexample, the emerging IEC Generic Immunity standardfor industrial environments currently published byCENELEC as EN 50082-2 recommends a genericequipment immunity limit for Europe. When publishedby IEC, this standard will provide a generic equipmentvoltage sag immunity limit. Another example is the USNational Fire Protection Association on IndustrialMachinery (NFPA 79), which sets a generic equipmentvoltage sag immunity limit for the United States.R1-2.2 These emerging generic limits were considered inthe establishment of ride-through limits for semiconductorequipment. However, most generic equipment limits areless stringent than the existing CBEMA-curve currentlyreferenced in SEMI E51. For most installations meetingthe CBEMA limits (a specification which was developedfor computer business equipment) still results in anunacceptable number of semiconductor equipmentinterrupts. Therefore, the requirements in thisinternational standard were developed to better suit thesemiconductor industry. While more stringent, thisindustry-specific specification is not in conflict withknown generic equipment regulations from other regionsor generic equipment standards from other organizations.R1-2.3 Another published IEC standard defines a genericimmunity test method for voltage sags (dips), IEC 61000-4-11. This standard does not provide limits but doesprovide a voltage sag test method for single-phaseequipment rated less than 16 amps. It has beenconsidered in defining voltage sag ride-throughparameters and it may provide an interim voltage sagimmunity test method. As noted in this document, a testmethod for three-phase equipment greater than 16 amps isbeing developed for use with semiconductor equipment.R1-2.4 The generic type standards developed forindustrial or consumer equipment by organizations likeIEC, ITIC, and IEEE provide a foundation for industry-specific standards like those published by SEMIStandards. In acknowledgement of this tiered approach tostandardization there are provisions for recognizingindustry-specific or product-type standards byorganizations like IEC. Typically, product-type standardswhen developed by industry-specific organizations takeprecedent over the broader based generic industrialstandards.

SEMI F48-0600 © SEMI 20001 SEMI F48-0600TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMERMATERIALS This test method was technically approved by the Global Facilities Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Facilities Committee. Current edition approved by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on March 2, 2000. Initially available on www.semi.org April 2000; to be publishedJune 2000.1 Purpose1.1 This method provides a proced ure for determiningthe nonvolatile trace inorganic impurities in bulkpolymeric materials. 2 Scope2.1 Following digestion by dry ash ing (DDA) ordigestion in closed vessel (DCV) preparationtechniques, samples previously obtained and cleanedaccording to SEMI F40 are analyzed for traceinorganics using inductively coupled plasma-massspectrometry (ICPMS), graphite furnace atomicabsorption spectroscopy (GFAAS), and/or inductivelycoupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICPAES).2.2 Materials for analysis include, but are not limitedto: Raw polymer materials (resins), such as pellets ofperfluoroalkoxy (PFA), polyvinylidene fluoride(PVDF), ethylenechlorotrifluoroethylene (ECTFE),polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polypropylene (PP),polyethylene (PE), acetal resin, polyvinyl chloride(PVC), Perfluoromethylether-based Perfluoro-alkoxy (MFA) and powders of polytetrafluoro-ethylene (PTFE). Polymer components of tubing, piping, fittings,valves, regulators, filter housings, filter cartridges,Orings and gaskets used in ultrapure water (UPW)and liquid chemical distribution systems (LCDS).See Section 3.8 for further information. Ion-exchange resins Polymer products used in the manufacturing ofsemiconductor devices, such as wafer carriers andwands, as well as accessories internal to wetequipment (e.g., drums in spin rinse dryers, tanksin quick dump rinsers). See Section 3.8 for furtherinformation.2.3 The DDA sections of this docu ment refer to anashing technique, whereby the sample is placed into aplatinum or quartz crucible and thermally decomposed.Thermal decomposition in muffle furnace or microwavemuffle furnace may also be used. Additionally, oxygen plasma may be used separately or in conjunction withthese techniques.2.4 The DCV sections of this docu ment refer to closedvessel microwave acid decomposition at elevatedtemperature and pressure. Alternatively closed vesselthermal conduction heating may also be applied.2.5 ICPMS, GFAAS, and ICPA ES are allappropriate methods for inorganic analysis. ICPMS isthe preferred method because it is more sensitive andefficient. Alternate procedures may be used if theymeet the same analytical performance criteria. Eachlaboratory is responsible for verifying the validity ofeach method within its own operation.2.6 This method is applicable for t he elements foundin Table 1:Table 1 List of Applicable Elements (See NOTE 1.)Aluminum MagnesiumBarium ManganeseCalcium NickelChromium PotassiumCobalt SodiumCopper StrontiumIron TinLead TitaniumLithium ZincMolybdenum ZirconiumNOTE 1: See Limitations, Section 3.3.2.7 This method may be used for o ther materials, orother nonvolatile elements, if the end-user wishes andperformance is demonstrated for the analyte of interest,in the matrices of interest, at the concentration levels ofinterest.2.8 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 The accuracy of the method is limited by thedetection limits of the instruments and by the samplepreparation procedure.

SEMI F48-0600 © SEMI 2000 2 3.2 This procedure anticipates ana lysis levels in theppm (mass/mass) range. Impurities less than 0.1 ppmmay not be detected by this method.3.3 When extending the method to other elementsrecovery should be evaluated during validation. Poorrecovery rates are often found for volatile elementssuch as boron (B), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb),mercury (Hg), gold (Au), and tungsten (W) because ofthe relatively high temperature sample preparationmethod and poor stability of some elements in aqueoussolution. Elements forming volatile halogenides can beaffected due to the in-situ production of hydrogenhalogenides when halogenated polymers are ashed.3.4 This is a bulk analysis techniq ue. For leachabletesting or surface analysis refer to the RelatedDocuments (Section 16) of this method.3.5 Due to the rapid advances in d igestion technology,consult the manufacturers recommended instructionsfor guidance when conducting analyses using the DCVsections of this document.3.6 DCV techniques can generate gaseous digestionreaction products, very reactive, or volatile materials athigh pressures. Spontaneous venting which can occurduring sample heating may cause venting of the vesselswith potential loss of sample and analytes. Samplesizes greater than 0.25 g may accentuate this event.3.7 In the use of the DCV techniqu e, TiO2, alumina,and other oxides may not be totally dissolved.Sequestering of target analyte elements may occur.3.8 Although this method allows t he sampling of smallpieces of polymer that are mechnically removed from alarger item, obtaining such samples in a clean mannermay be difficult. Multiple sampling, separation andpreparation techniques might be necessary to establishconfidence in the results.3.9 This document is not intended to supersedeinternational, national or local codes, regulations, andlaws. Each should be consulted to ensure that themethod meets regulatory requirements in each location. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardSEMI F40  Practice for Preparing Liquid ChemicalDistribution Components for Chemical Testing 4.2 ASTM Standard1ASTM D4375  Standard Practice for BasicDefinitions, Notation, and Symbology for Statistics inCommittee D19 on Water 1 American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race St.,Philadelphia, PA 19103 NOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 5 Terminology5.1 Acronyms and Abbreviations5.1.1 AAS/GFAAS  atomic absorp tion spectroscopy/graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy5.1.2 amu  atomic mass unit5.1.3 DCV  digestion in closed ve ssel5.1.4 DDA  digestion by dry ashin g5.1.5 GFAAS  graphite furnace at omic absorptionspectroscopy5.1.6 ICPAES  inductively coupl ed plasmaatomicemission spectroscopy5.1.7 ICPMS  inductively couple d plasmamassspectrometry5.1.8 ppb  parts per billion by ma ss (ng/g)5.1.9 ppm  parts per million by m ass (g/g)5.1.10 UPW  ultrapure water (see S ection 9.4) 6 Summary of Test Method6.1 Samples previously prepared u sing SEMI F40 areashed or digested under pressure within a digestiondevice, and trace inorganics in the residue are dissolvedinto acid and UPW. The sample is then analyzed byICPMS, GFAAS, and/or ICPAES to determine theinorganic content of the material. This method appliesonly to nonvolatile metals (i.e., alkali metals, alkalineearths, and transition metals).6.2 Data from different tests can b e compared todetermine the inorganic content in different materialsand in the same material from different manufacturers. 7 Significance and Use7.1 Determining the metallic conta minationconcentration in bulk polymer materials used in eitherdistribution systems for process fluids or products indirect contact with the wafer is important criterion fordeciding the suitability of a material. For example,ultrapure water contaminated by distribution systemcomponents may adversely affect microelectronic andother processes.7.2 This method measures the tota l amount ofimpurities in the bulk of the material. These impuritieswill not necessarily leach into a process fluid stream.

SEMI F48-0600 © SEMI 2000 4 10.1.2 Care must be taken in the hand ling and use ofthe acids to avoid acid burns or contamination of theacid. Acid should be neutralized before disposal.10.1.3 Care must be taken when using the propanetorch to avoid burns. The torch should not be used nearflammable materials or solvents.10.1.4 Care must be taken when using the mufflefurnace to avoid burns.10.1.5 When ashing fluoropolymeric materials, theashing must be performed in a fume hood. Whenheated, fluoropolymer materials outgas hydrofluoricacid fumes and may also emit fluoropolymeric particleswhich, if inhaled, can cause a condition known aspolymer fume fever. If hot fluoropolymer fumes areinhaled, remove the individual to a well-ventilated areaand seek medical attention.10.1.6 The outer layers of vessels use d in the DCVtechnique are frequently not as acid or reagent resistantas the liner material. To retain the performance andsafety required these outer layers must be neitherchemically degraded nor physically damaged. Routineexamination of the vessel materials may be required toensure their safe use.10.1.7 Only DCV containers with pre ssure relief orcontrol mechanisms or containers with suitably inertpolymeric or quartz liners and pressure reliefmechanisms are considered acceptable for use with thisprocess.NOTE 4: Only microwave manufacturers approved vesselsfor that device should be used. 10.1.8 Use of laboratory microwave s ystems isrequired for this method. Users are advised not to usedomestic (kitchen) type microwave ovens or cookware.Nor should inappropriately sealed containers withoutpressure relief for microwave acid digestions be used.See Section 16.3.1 for additional information on safetyissues concerning the use of laboratory microwavesystems.10.1.9 Toxic nitrogen oxide(s), hydro gen fluoride, andtoxic chlorine (from the addition of hydrochloric acid)fumes are usually produced during digestion.Therefore, all steps involving open or the opening ofdigestion vessels must be performed in a properlyoperating fume ventilation system.10.1.10 The analyst should wear appro priateprotective clothing, such as gloves and face protection,and must not at any time permit a solution containinghydrofluoric acid to come in contact with skin or lungs. 10.2 Technical Precautions  Diges tion by Dry Ashing(DDA)10.2.1 Flaming and ashing temperatu res must becontrolled so that they do not exceed 650°C tominimize metal loss due to volatilization. If thecrucible becomes excessively hot for longer than aboutone minute during flaming, it may have overheated.When testing the method for recovery rates, it willbecome apparent that the sample has been overheatedfrom the low recovery of metals.10.2.2 One method of cleaning the cr ucibles andcovers is to flame them with a propane torch or otherappropriate heating source until they are sufficientlyhot, allow them to cool, rinse in dilute ultrapure nitricacid, and then rinse in ultrapure water.10.2.3 When ashing a sample, take ca re that all of theash residue remains in the crucible.10.2.4 Several factors concerning sele ction of cruciblematerials should be considered when performing theDDA technique. For example, the crucible itself cancontribute elevated levels of its own composition intosamples at trace levels. Temperature restrictions areanother factor to consider in the selection of thecrucible material. Corrosion of the crucible during thedecomposition of the sample should also be considered.For example, in the ashing of fluorinated materials,platinum is preferred over quartz glass that could beetched by the liberated hydrogen fluoride.10.3 Technical Precautions  Diges tion in ClosedVessel (DCV)10.3.1 Trace analysis requires a thoro ugh cleaning.One method of cleaning the vessels is to leach with hot(1:1) hydrochloric acid (greater than 80 C, but less thanboiling) for a minimum of two hours followed with hot(1:1) nitric acid (greater than 80 C, but less thanboiling) for a minimum of two hours and rinsed withreagent water and dried in a clean environment.10.4 Other Technical Precautions10.4.1 When switching between high concentrationsamples and low concentration samples, all crucibles ordigestion vessels should be cleaned according to thecorresponding and recommended cleaning procedure.This cleaning procedure should also be used wheneverthe prior use of the digestion vessels is unknown orcross contamination from vessels is suspected.10.4.2 Trace metallic levels of reagen t blanks must besignificantly lower than those in the sample in order toobtain accurate results for the analyte of interest.10.4.3 Perform sample preparation in a cleanenvironment and under a fume hood to minimizecontamination.

SEMI F48-0600 © SEMI 20005 11 Sampling11.1 Sampling of Test Specimens11.1.1 Test specimens shall be repres entative of thepolymer material being tested and shall be free ofembedded particles and extraneous surfacecontamination when visually inspected.11.1.2 Two samples of each material shall be preparedper SEMI F40. This test is performed in duplicate.More samples may be analyzed if desired.NOTE 5: The samples are cleaned and weighed according toSEMI F40. The sample preparation described in thisdocument begins with either the ashing (DDA) or digestionunder pressure (DCV) of the polymer material. 11.2 Sample Preparation  Digestio n by Dry Ashing(DDA)NOTE 6: Digestion by ashing using an oxygen plasma asherdiffers considerably from the described procedures that referto ashing in open crucibles. Specific instructions are availablefrom the instrument manufacturers. 11.2.1 Clean the digestion container a nd cover usingappropriate methods for the vessel materials andprocedures being employed.11.2.2 Place the sample into a cleaned crucible. For atleast two additional samples, add the recovery spike asdiscussed in Section 12.11.2.3 Use a propane torch or other a ppropriate heat-ing source to carefully flame the outside of the crucibleuntil the polymer inside the crucible is completelycharred. Do not flame exceedingly, i.e., do not allow aplatinum crucible, for example, to become red hot, asexcessive heat will allow some metals to volatilize.NOTE 7: This step must be carried out in a well-ventilatedfume hood. 11.2.4 Prepare at least three procedur al blanks byflaming three or more empty crucibles using the methoddiscussed in Section 11.2.3. The results from theseblanks will be used to determine the metalliccontribution from the crucibles themselves, from thereagents and from the test procedure. These proceduralblanks should be treated like any other sample.Crucibles should be rotated in and out of service so thatthe same crucibles are not always used for blanks.11.2.5 Place the charred sample cruci bles and blankcrucibles in a muffle furnace, cover the crucibles withthe cleaned covers, and continue to char at 500 to650°C until all the carbon is removed (usually over aperiod of 618 hrs). The removal of all carbon is indi-cated by the absence of black material in the sample.NOTE 8: Some oxides (such as SnO2) are black and mayconfound this determination. If a sample is still black after 18 hours, assume that it is an oxide and continue with theprocedure. 11.2.6 Allow the crucibles to cool.11.2.7 Add the appropriate amount (1 2 mL) ofconcentrated ultrapure hydrochloric acid to eachcrucible.11.2.8 Evaporate the hydrochloric aci d to dryness in achemical hood at less than 100°C if necessary to permitinstrumental compatibility.NOTE 9: The presence of chloride in the sample can result ininterferences for the determination of arsenic and vanadiumby ICP-MS. 11.2.9 Continue preparing the sample as described inSection 11.4.11.3 Sample Preparation  Digestio n in Closed Vessel(DCV)11.3.1 Clean the digestion container a nd cover usingappropriate methods for the vessel materials andprocedures being employed.11.3.2 Place the sample into a cleaned digestioncontainer. For at least two additional samples, add therecovery spike as discussed in Section 12.11.3.3 Add the reagents needed for th e digestion.11.3.4 Prepare at least three procedur al blanks byadding the same amount of all reagents, but no sample,to three or more additional containers. The results fromthese blanks will be used to determine the metalliccontribution from the containers themselves, from thereagents and from the test procedure. These proceduralblanks should be treated like any other sample.Containers should be rotated in and out of service sothat the same containers are not always used for blanks.11.3.5 The analyst should be aware o f the potential fora vigorous reaction. If a vigorous reaction occurs uponthe initial addition of reagent or the sample is suspectedof containing easily oxidizable materials, allow thesample to predigest in the uncapped digestion vessel.Heat may be added in this step for safety considerations(for example the rapid release of carbon dioxide fromeasily oxidized polymeric material). Once the initialreaction has ceased, the sample may continue throughthe digestion procedure.11.3.6 Seal the vessel according to th e manufacturersdirections.11.3.7 Properly place the vessel in the digestionsystem according to the manufacturers recommendedspecifications and connect appropriate temperature andpressure sensors to vessels according to manufacturersspecifications.

SEMI F48-0600 © SEMI 2000 6 11.3.8 Set the parameters of the diges tion device tomanufacturers recommendations.NOTE 10: If the pressure exceeds the pressure limits of thevessel, the pressure will be reduced by the relief mechanismof the vessel.NOTE 11: Pressure control for a specific matrix is applicableif instrument conditions are established using temperaturecontrol. Because each matrix will have a different reactionprofile, performance using temperature control must bedeveloped for every specific matrix type prior to use of thepressure control system. 11.3.9 At the end of the digestion pro gram, allow thevessels to cool for an appropriate period of time beforeremoving them from the system. When the vesselshave cooled to near room temperature, determine if themicrowave vessels have maintained a seal throughoutthe digestion. Due to the wide variability of vesseldesigns, a single procedure is not appropriate. The useof a spiked control sample is appropriate to ensure thatanalyte loss has not occurred due to vessel venting. Forvessels with burst disks, a careful visual inspection ofthe disk may identify compromised sample digestions.11.3.10 Complete the preparation of th e sample bycarefully uncapping and venting each vessel in a fumehood. Vent the vessels using the procedurerecommended by the vessel manufacturer. Transfer thesample to an appropriate acid cleaned container.11.3.11 If the digested sample contains particulates,which may clog nebulizers or interfere with injection ofthe sample into the instrument, the sample may becentrifuged, allowed to settle, or filtered.11.3.11.1 If necessary, centrifugation at 2,0003,000rpm for 10 minutes is usually sufficient to clear thesupernatant.11.3.11.2 Settling  If undissolved mate rial remainssuch as TiO, or other refractory oxides, allow thesample to stand until the supernatant is clear. Allowinga sample to stand overnight will usually accomplishthis.11.3.11.3 Filtering  If necessary, the f ilteringapparatus must be thoroughly cleaned and pre-rinsedwith dilute (approximately 10% V/V) nitric acid. Filterthe sample through qualitative filter paper into a secondacid-cleaned container.11.3.12 Continue preparing the sample as described inSection 11.4.11.4 Preparation of the Sample for Analysis11.4.1 If the sample was obtained fro m the DDAmethod, add 0.5 mL concentrated nitric acid to eachcrucible. 11.4.2 For samples obtained from the DCV method,transfer or decant the sample into volumetric ware.11.4.3 Dilute either obtained sample to a requiredvolume with ultrapure water (usually 20 mL).Alternatively, a gravimetric dilution of the samples isalso appropriate. The samples are now ready foranalysis. See Related Documents, Section 16 forapplicable trace inorganics test methods. 12 Recovery Preparation and PercentageRecovery Rate Determination12.1 Metal recovery percentage mu st be determinedfor all instruments by the individual laboratory. This isaccomplished via spiking a crucible or digestion vesselcontaining a polymer sample with a knownconcentration of metals. Then, determining thepercentage of each metal recovered after thedecomposition process or acid digestion. The followingprovides the recommended method for spiking:12.1.1 Add a known volume of a stan dard to a crucibleor digestion container containing a polymer sample.12.1.2 For DDA  Gently evaporate the standardsolution to dryness.12.1.3 Digest the dried standard and d ried polymerusing the same procedure as for the samples. Typicalrecovery rates are 70110% for the alkali, alkalineearths, and most transition metals. 13 Data Analysis13.1 Calculations13.1.1 The concentration of trace met als in thesolution must be calculated to determine theconcentration in g/g (ppm) of the polymeric materialusing the following equation:polymer concentration (g/g ) == solution concentration(g/L)  solution volume (L) / mass of the polymer(g)13.1.2 Since the procedural blank doe s not contain aweighed sample, the results must be transformed tosolid concentrations (in g/g) by using the averageweight of the samples (see Section 11.1.2 andcorresponding NOTE). 14 Data PresentationNOTE 12: Use the Report Form provided in Section 17 of thisdocument. 14.1 Sample Information14.1.1 Provide the date(s) of the test, the person and/orcompany requesting the analysis, the method in whichthe sample was obtained (e.g., if it was separated from a

SEMI F49-0200 © SEMI 20001 SEMI F49-0200GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAGIMMUNITY This guide was technically approved by the Global Facilities Committee and is the direct responsibility of theNorth American Facilities Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on December 15, 1999. Initially available on www.semi.org February 2000; to be publishedFebruary 2000. 1 Purpose1.1 A guide defining a systems ap proach to powerconditioning is needed for semiconductor and flat paneldisplay (FPD) facilities. Semiconductor and FPDfactories require high levels of power quality due to thesensitivity of equipment and process controls.Semiconductor and FPD processing equipment isespecially vulnerable to voltage sags. The facilityelectrical system distributes power to processequipment, support equipment, and facilityinfrastructure equipment. Facility electrical distributionsystems should be designed to integrate the voltage sagsusceptibility of all the equipment with the powerquality supplied by the utility. Installing effective andefficient facilities power conditioning requiresidentification of appropriate conditioning technologiesand properly applying the conditioning equipment.1.2 Utilizing recommendations in this guide shouldresult in effective power conditioning of the facilityelectrical distribution system such that the processequipment, associated support equipment and facilitiesinfrastructure equipment function within acceptableranges. 2 Scope2.1 This guide is intended for facil ities engineers,equipment engineers, and facilities managers whospecify compatibility requirements for equipment andutility services, and in particular for electrical powerrequirements such as those found in SEMI E51.2.2 This document provides recom mendations forimplementing a systems approach to identification andresolution of voltage sag events that disturb theperformance of semiconductor process equipment. Aprogram recommending facilities electrical distributionsystem monitoring and control strategies for both thedirect and indirect effect of voltage sags on waferprocessing is outlined as follows: Reasons for monitoring and conditioning (seeSection 7.1). Facilities electrical distribution system powermonitoring and conditioning (see Section 7.2).  Quantifying process equipment performance (seeSection 7.3). Quantifying support equipment and facilitiesinfrastructure equipment performance (see Section7.4). Utility power monitoring strategies (see Section7.5). Measurement and modeling strategies (see Section7.6). Power enhancing and conditioning strategies foruse in the facilities electrical distribution system(see Section 7.7).2.3 This guide does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this guide to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This guide addresses power qu ality monitoring andconditioning solutions primarily within the facilitieselectrical distribution system. Process equipment andutility performance are covered in other relatedstandards.3.2 This guide does not address th e impact of voltagesags on equipment beyond the effect to the electricalcomponents. Effects on interdependent equipmentinterlocks are not examined in detail in this document.3.3 This guide is not intended to a ddress design ormaterials issues related to safety which are addressedelsewhere in the SEMI guidelines (see SEMI S2).3.4 This document is not intended to supersedeinternational, national or local codes, regulations andlaws.

A voltage sag eventadversely affecting only one of these pieces ofequipment can cause processing equipment tomalfunction. Both the direct and indirect effect ofvoltage sags on process equipment should be managed.Voltage sags can effect process equipment directlythrough the electrical power points of connection.Voltage sags can also indirectly effect processequipment through fluctuations in air, gas, liquid, andother utility streams caused when voltage sags effectsupport equipment and facility infrastructureequipment.6.2 Examples of processing equipm ent, supportequipment, and facilities infrastructure equipment are 1 The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, Inc.

The systemshould recognize electrical power that does not meetspecification and provide proper power conditioning soas not to impact wafer processing.7.1.2 Power monitoring is used to measure electricalsystem power quality performance for the followingreasons.a) Monitoring data can be compared toequipment voltage sag specifications toidentify problems.b) Selection and control of power conditioningdevices are dependent upon monitoringmeasurements. 7.1.3 Power conditioning is implem ented to correct forgaps in equipment voltage sag susceptibility and pointof connection electrical power performance. Powerconditioning is occasionally implemented where therisk of unacceptable equipment performance is high,where equipment performance tolerance is outsidespecifications, and where equipment interruption iscostly.7.2 Monitoring and Conditioning Program7.2.1 Quantify the process equipmen t, supportequipment, and facilities infrastructure equipmentvoltage sag susceptibility using industry standardspecifications and test methods. (See Sections 7.3 and7.4.) 7.2.2 Set-up monitors for utility pow er quality (seeSection 7.5).7.2.3 Measure and/or model the imp act of the facilityelectrical distribution system on the utility powerdelivered to the process equipment (see Section 7.6).7.2.4 Model and evaluate cost/benef it of powerconditioning solutions where there are gaps or highrisks. Select and implement identified powerconditioning solutions into the facilities electricaldistribution system. (See Section 7.7.)7.2.5 Maintain the installed power c onditioningequipment and monitor the power either continuouslyor periodically to assure performance and evaluateresults.7.3 Process Equipment Performan ce7.3.1 Facility design specifications s hould includerequirements for processing equipment voltage sagimmunity (see industry specification for semiconductorprocessing equipment voltage sag immunity). (SeeRelated Documents section.)7.3.2 Variability in process equipme nt manufacturingand supplied utility power quality preclude interruptionfree manufacturing. This variation comes frommultiple sources:a) Verification of representative samples ofequipment does not guarantee 100% of theequipment will meet the same requirements.b) Factors such as location, load changes,capacity, weather, and transmission/distribution equipment, limit how well utilitypower quality can be controlled.c) The tests, themselves, are not variation free;the test equipment, calibration processes, andthe test personnel can introduce furthervariability. 7.3.3 The risk of manufacturing inte rruptions can beconsiderably reduced through two approaches.a) Create a margin between allowable voltage sagfor the supplied utility power and processequipment voltage sag immunity.b) Provide added protection from interruptionsdue to voltage sag events by enhancing thepower quality in the facilities distributionsystem. (This approach is covered in thisdocument, see Scope and the middle segmentof Figure 1.)

SEMI F49-0200 © SEMI 20005 7.4 Support and Facilities Infrastr ucture EquipmentPerformance7.4.1 The effects that support equipment and facilitiesinfrastructure equipment have on process equipmentshould be considered.7.4.2 Process and support equipmen t typically containflow, temperature, or pressure sensors. If facilityinfrastructure equipment malfunctions due to a voltagesag event, the diminished flow of a required fluid or gaswill cause the support or process equipment to alarm,malfunction, or stop.7.4.3 A typical interconnection of fa cilityinfrastructure equipment with process and supportequipment is illustrated in Figure 2. The varioussupport and facilities infrastructure systems that canhave an indirect effect on process equipmentperformance when subjected to voltage sag events arelisted below: Process cooling water, Scrubbed exhaust, Volatile organic compound (VOC) exhaust, Gas cabinets and gas monitoring systemcontrollers, Compressed dry air, Process vacuum, Automated wafer transport systems, Computer integrated manufacturing (CIM)systems, Gas leak detection systems, Exhaust abatement systems, and Bulk chemical delivery system.7.4.4 Since the supplied utility powe r quality effectsall the equipment within the factory, performancerequirements for support equipment and facilitiesinfrastructure equipment should be specified using thesame standards used for processing equipment.Applying the same voltage sag susceptibilityspecifications for semiconductor processing equipment(see industry specification for semiconductorprocessing equipment voltage sag immunity) to thesupport equipment and the facilities infrastructureequipment has the following benefits: (See RelatedDocuments section.)a) Use of the same specification for allequipment allows for consistency whenmonitoring and conditioning for the effects ofvoltage sag events. b) The same performance verification testmethods as those used for processingequipment can be applied to the supportequipment and facilities infrastructureequipment. 7.4.5 Where it is inefficient to have support and/orfacilities infrastructure equipment supplied to meet thesame specifications as process equipment, the facilityelectrical distribution system may be required tocompensate for any specification gap.7.5 Monitoring Strategies7.5.1 Use power disturbance monito rs and/or digitalfault recorders to monitor voltage to detect compliance(see IEEE 1159). Monitor current to identifydisturbance sources and assist in solutions.7.5.2 Locate continuous monitoring at the electricalutility service, all major facility electrical distributioncenters, and all critical equipment electrical points ofconnection. Perform periodic monitoring for at leastone location of each equipment type in order tocharacterize the electrical environment under normalconditions (i.e., to create a baseline). Additionalmonitoring should be performed when experiencingunexplained operational problems. A comparison ofbaseline data to monitored data for equipmentexperiencing problems is recommended for evaluatingthe power supplied to the equipment.7.5.3 Provide time synchronization f or multiplemonitors to allow for the correlation of a single voltagesag event between all monitors.7.5.4 In order to understand the imp act, correlatemonitored voltage sag events with known waferprocessing effects within the process equipment.7.6 Measuring and Modeling Stra tegies7.6.1 A single voltage sag event orig inating outsidethe factory will vary in magnitude and duration whenmeasured at differing locations throughout the facility.This is largely due to differing lengths and type ofdistribution conductors feeding equipment locatedthroughout the facility. In addition, the electricalinteractions of the reactive and non-linear elements ofequipment effect the voltage sag measurements.7.6.2 Voltage sag events that origina te within thefacility electrical distribution system will vary inmagnitude and duration when measured at differinglocations throughout the facility. These voltage sagevents are usually a result of a current flow increase andthe associated voltage drop across the conductorsbetween the source and load. The location along thecurrent flow path greatly effects the voltage sagmeasured.

SEMI F49-0200 © SEMI 2000 6 7.6.3 Computer design tools should be used to modelthe electrical distribution system in order to calculateanticipated voltage sags for utility or site originatedfaults. If limitations exist such that voltage sagmonitors are not located at every piece of equipment,then event measurements can be adjusted frommodeling information to determine voltage sag valuesat other locations.7.6.4 As a means for measuring effe ctiveness in abusiness environment, it would be useful to statisticallymodel the effect of voltage sag events on themanufacturing processes. The variations mentioned inSection 7.3.2, above, preclude a deterministic approachto how well a wafer fabrication process will perform fora given voltage sag event. A statistical correlationmodel would aid in estimating the correlation betweenvoltage sags and manufacturing cost, and can be used tovalidate the effectiveness of power enhancement andconditioning programs.7.6.5 Example of Voltage Sag Event Modeling7.6.5.1 A voltage sag event originatin g on theelectrical utility system often exhibits differentcharacteristics when measured at different locations onfacility electrical distribution systems. The variance involtage sag characteristics can create different effectson similar equipment. Variances can usually beexplained by examining 1) the characteristics of voltagesag at the utility interfaces, 2) the type and connectionconfiguration of voltage transformations, and 3) thevoltage levels and corresponding phase relationships atthe terminals of infrastructure, support, and processequipment within the facility.7.6.5.2 The types of faults that can oc cur on a utilitysystem are: Line to line to line, Line to line to line to ground, Line to line, Line to line to ground, and Line to ground.7.6.5.3 The utility network can be mo deled to predictthe voltage sag characteristics due to various types offaults at the electrical interfaces between asemiconductor manufacturing facility and utility. Themost common utility system fault type is a single line toground fault. An example of the translation of avoltage sag resulting from a line to ground voltage sagevent is provided in the following sections.7.6.5.4 Typical voltage transformation s from theutility interface to utilization voltage levels areillustrated in Figure 3. Under normal conditions, the three phase voltages are all approximately equal anddisplaced 120 from each other. During a voltage sagevent due to an unbalanced fault, this relationshipchanges. Delta-wye transformers between the origin ofthe fault and the equipment being studied will furtheraffect the phase and magnitude relationships. Thedegree to which voltage phase shift and magnitudechanges occur at each transformation throughout thefacility distribution system should be considered whenexamining impacts on individual equipment.

(See Related Documentssection.)7.6.5.6 Many devices in process, supp ort, and facilitiesinfrastructure equipment are not connected to all threephases. Because the voltage sag response of thesedevices may dictate the sag response for the entireequipment assembly, understanding device connectionconfiguration and sag response characteristics is ofcritical importance. Sag depth and duration, the pointon the wave at which the sag begins, and thecorresponding phase relationships are all known to be

In this example the voltage sags to only88% of nominal on these phases, but drops to 33% ofnominal on phase C. The industry specification forsemiconductor processing equipment voltage sagimmunity does not specify that equipment ride-througha sag to 33% of nominal voltage.7.6.5.8 If two low voltage transformat ions were usedto derive the 208-volt facility system (see Figure 4),phase B voltage would be unaffected during the utilityvoltage sag, but phases A and C would sag to 58% ofnominal. Industry standards typically requireequipment to ride-through a sag of this depth.However, a tolerance designed into the facility systemmay be necessary to provide adequate systemprotection.7.7 Power Enhancing and Conditi oning Strategies 7.7.1 While it is desirable to reduce and eliminatebattery storage devices provided by equipmentsuppliers with individual pieces of process equipment,battery storage devices may be appropriate as acentralized or distributed part of a facilities distributionsystem (when evaluated in a systems approach to powerenhancement and conditioning).7.7.2 Facility power systems enhanc ements should beexamined on a case-by-case approach to determine theappropriate measure of power conditioning to beapplied. In general, the following types of equipmentare frequently used to mitigate the effects of utilityvoltage sag events in semiconductor factories. Constant voltage transformers (typically applied oncontrol systems) Diesel engine based uninterruptible power supplies(UPS) Magnetic synthesizers Motor-generators Rotary UPS Static UPS Static transfer switches with alternate powersystems7.7.3 Other power enhancement tech niques andequipment available for use in facilities electricaldistribution systems include but are not limited to thefollowing: Capacitors for voltage regulation, Filters for power conditioning, High resistance grounding, Isolation of electrical circuit from other loads, Power line conditioners, Primary and secondary selective rather than radialdistribution systems, Super-conducting magnetic energy storagesystems, Transformer load tap changers, and Voltage regulators.7.7.4 Power enhancement and condi tioning equipmentcan be applied at selected equipment components,selected distribution circuits, or selected distributionbuses.

SEMI F50-0200 © SEMI 20001 SEMI F50-0200GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FORSEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES This guide was technically approved by the Global Facilities Committee and is the direct responsibility of theNorth American Facilities Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on December 15, 1999. Initially available on www.semi.org February 2000; to be publishedFebruary 2000. 1 Purpose1.1 This guide provides a framewo rk forsemiconductor and flat panel display (FPD)manufacturers and their electric utility service providersto minimize the effect of voltage sag events onsemiconductor processing. In particular, this guidefocuses on electric utility power quality performancegoals that are complementary to voltage sag immunitylevels for semiconductor processing equipment andfacilities infrastructure equipment (see Figure 1).Recommendations for measuring and evaluatingvoltage sag performance, evaluating utility systemenhancements, and implementation of a continuousimprovement process are included since no electricutility industry standards exist.1.2 Utility systems are designed, c onstructed, andoperated to meet utility industry regulations andrequirements. One important requirement forsemiconductor factories is power system reliability.Utilities measure reliability in minutes of voltageoutages per customer per year. Semiconductor factoriesrequire a high level of power system reliability, anyservice outage is usually unacceptable. A secondimportant requirement is power quality. Power qualityrelates to disturbed voltage waveforms, not outages.When utilities implement measures to increase powersystem reliability, power quality can be adverselyaffected. The structured approach defined in this guidecan achieve high levels of power quality withoutsacrificing power reliability.1.3 The intent of this guide is to he lp semiconductormanufacturers achieve both high levels of powerreliability and power quality from energy utilityproviders. By becoming familiar with the cause andeffect relationships of voltage sag events on the utilitysside of the electric meter, semiconductor manufacturersand electric utilities can work together to pursueefficient solutions for improved voltage sag ride-through in semiconductor factories. 2 Scope2.1 The scope of this guide extend s beyond adiscussion of typical electric utility reliability andquality improvement techniques to developing acontinuous improvement process for electric utilityvoltage sag performance (depicted graphically in Figure2). Factors in this process include the following: Define desired performance criteria by settinggoals for voltage sag event duration and magnitude(see Section 6.1). Measure performance for both proposed andexisting semiconductor factory sites (see Section6.2). Summarize voltage sag event data and identify theimpact on semiconductor processing and facilitiesinfrastructure equipment (see Section 6.3). Recommend improvements that includeconsideration of cost, benefit, and risk.Improvements can include corrective action toeliminate system faults, changes to serviceconfigurations, and power enhancements (seeSection 6.4). Select and implement improvements. Establish acontinuous improvement process (see Section 6.5).2.2 For the purposes of this docum ent, the termElectric Utility refers to energy service providers (thatsell energy to semiconductor manufacturers) and/orelectric transmission and distribution providers (thatdeliver energy through their power lines).2.3 This guide does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this guide to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.

Also known as voltagedip. 6 Electric Utility Voltage Sa g PerformanceRecommendations6.1 Define Voltage Sag Performan ce6.1.1 Defining a goal for acceptable voltage sagduration and magnitude is useful in establishing abenchmark or reference point for monitoring 1 The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, Inc., 345 East47th Street, New York, NY 10017-2394, USA improvement. Events can be identified and categorizedwithin the realm of the electric utility or thesemiconductor manufacturer. Industry specificationsfor semiconductor processing equipment voltage sagimmunity (which define the level of voltage sagimmunity required for semiconductor processingequipment) are recommended as a performance goal.Using this goal for the performance of electric utilityservices will provide consistency with semiconductorprocessing equipment capabilities. (See RelatedDocuments section.)6.1.2 The goal for the maximum num ber of deviationsfrom specified performance per year is zero. However,it is useful to recognize that utility generation,transmission, and distribution systems are subject toenvironmental and regulatory conditions that maynegatively influence the ability to provide zerodeviations on a continuous basis.6.1.2.1 Document regulatory and envi ronmentalrequirements that will limit the electric utilitys choiceswhen implementing improvements, such as ratestructures or rights-of-way.6.2 Measure Performance6.2.1 Measuring Performance at Pr oposed Semi-conductor Factory Sites6.2.1.1 Factory site selection teams sh ould considerthe importance of power and power quality whenevaluating potential sites. To insure that power qualityconsiderations are properly factored into the siteselection process, a selection factor should be assignedto power quality and reliability criteria.6.2.1.2 Utility electrical service config urations shouldbe considered when measuring and comparingreliability and power quality performance at differentlocations. The load profile for the proposed factory isused to determine the standard utility electrical serviceconfiguration. Usually, larger factories (&gt; 10 MW)exceed allowable loading for lower voltage distributionsystems (&lt; 69 kV), therefore a high voltage service isthe typical configuration for larger semiconductorfactories. Selection of the highest available servicevoltage is preferred for reliability due to two factors.First, the area of exposure is greater for lower voltagessince they include both higher and lower voltage systemdistribution lines and equipment. Second, highervoltage systems can provide energy to lower voltagesystem faults with little or no impact to high voltagesystem voltages, whereas, lower voltage systems aregreatly impacted by faults not buffered by transformers.6.2.1.3 The preferred method for comparing powerquality and reliability from different locations involvescreating a summary of the number of voltage sag events

SeeIEEE 1346 for suggested voltage sag event categoryand weighting factors.6.2.1.4 Model events.6.2.1.4.1 If actual disturbance data is no t available,modeling results based on simulation of actualelectrical faults should be calculated and reviewed.These studies called area of vulnerability analysisdetermine transmission lines and equipment wherefaults can adversely impact a semiconductor factory.NOTE 2: As monitoring data is later collected, the modelingresults should be validated. 6.2.1.5 Monitor events near proposed site(s).6.2.1.5.1 Define monitoring protocol per the methodoutlined in Section 6.2.2.2.6.2.1.5.2 Upon establishing an appropriate electricalservice configuration, reliability and power qualityinformation relative to that service configuration shouldbe requested from the electric utility. Depending uponutility rate structures, semiconductor manufacturersmay be required to pay separately for this analysis.Where available, the information provided shouldinclude actual disturbance data from other selected sitescollected in accordance with IEEE 1159. Strive fordata on sites that have similar electrical serviceconfigurations and are located electrically close to theproposed site (e.g., ideally, from the same transmissionor distribution line).6.2.2 Measuring Performance at Ex isting Semi-conductor Factory Sites6.2.2.1 Preparation for monitoring.6.2.2.1.1 Review existing industry typic al voltage sagperformance data for utility point-of-service.6.2.2.1.2 Review existing site voltage sa g performancedata, usually taken at a variety of locations within thefactory.6.2.2.1.3 Review existing utility voltage sagperformance data for the area around the factory site,usually a 2030 mile radius of the service area issufficient.6.2.2.1.4 Review existing utility area of vulnerabilitymodeling studies for power flow and system powerquality.6.2.2.1.5 Document the existing utility a ndmanufacturing site electrical design and operatingprocedures.6.2.2.2 Define the monitoring protoco l. 6.2.2.2.1 Define where measurement de vices will belocated, how many to be installed, who will operate andmaintain them, and what are the standards forcalibration.6.2.2.2.2 Define sensitivity settings. Us uallymagnitude triggers are set as tightly as possible (95% ofnominal voltage). This will generate a large amount ofdata that will verify trends and maximize comparisonopportunities between cause and effect. After severalevaluation cycles magnitude triggers can be movedcloser to the criteria (90% of nominal voltage), in orderto focus improvement efforts on the more significantsags.6.2.2.3 Monitor the voltage sag perfor mance.6.2.2.3.1 Location of monitor(s) should be such thatthe utility point-of-service to the factory is representedby the recorded data. Data recorded remote from theutility point-of-service will be effected by other utilityor factory system components. Remote data should beadjusted to represent a utility point-of-serviceequivalent.6.2.2.4 Track and report events.6.2.2.4.1 Define the reporting format fo r all events andwho will receive the reports. (Example: Reports tocontain magnitude, duration, time/date stamp andimpact on process, if known. All events aresummarized and reported monthly. All out-of-specification events only are reported same day asevent. All reports distributed to both factory and utilityrepresentatives.)6.3 Summarize Data and Evaluate Impact6.3.1 Summarizing monitoring data.6.3.1.1 Figure 3 shows how monitorin g data can begraphically reported using charts representingmagnitude and duration.6.3.1.2 Monitored and measuring power qualityperformance provides the semiconductor manufacturerand their electric utility with empirical data on which tobase voltage sag performance and improvementdecisions.

The impact on factories, causes of events,and potential improvements may be evaluated on eachindividual bin or groups of bins. Increasing the numberof magnitude/duration bins used in the data comparisonrefines the accuracy, but also increases the effortneeded to translate events into discrete data bins. (SeeIEEE 1346 and Related Information 2.)6.3.2.3 For existing sites, define categ ories of eventimpact on manufacturing process. For example: In Spec Event/No known impact In Spec Event/Minor impact In Spec Event/Major impact Out of Spec Event/No known impact Out of Spec Event/Minor impact Out of Spec Event/Major impact6.3.2.3.1 The boundary between major a nd minorimpact is often cost or number of wafer moves lostconverted to an equivalent cost.6.4 Recommend Improvements6.4.1 Analyze costs, benefits, and ri sks.6.4.1.1 The improvement recommend ation processshould include the equivalent of identifying the costsrelated to the disturbances, the costs related toimprovements, and the effectiveness of improvements.The risks should be identified for taking no action, the possibility that events will occur during theimplementation of improvements, and that events willoccur as a result of unknown factors resulting from theinstallation of improvements. Improvements caninclude corrective action to eliminate system faults,changes to service configurations, and powerenhancements.6.4.2 Corrective action to eliminate system faults.6.4.2.1 The key to influencing an elec tric utilitysvoltage sag performance is mutual understanding ofmeasurement and improvement processes. Voltagesags on utility electric systems are created because offaults (short circuits) caused by a variety of events,including lightning, trees contacting power lines,equipment failure, and vehicles striking power poles.In order to reduce the number of voltage sag events, itis important to understand the specific cause of eachfault. Semiconductor manufacturers should request thatelectric utilities share disturbance investigation reportsand statistics. If data is not available, or tracking faultcauses is not a focus (many utilities track only outagecauses) then a fault tracking system should beestablished.6.4.2.2 Many times, the initially ident ified fault cause(for example lightning) has a more specific cause (forexample a contaminated insulator), with an even morespecific root cause (for example salt contamination oncoastal power lines in dry weather seasons).Identifying this root cause helps to establish theappropriate corrective action (for example, improvedinsulator cleaning practices to include weatherconsiderations on coastal lines). Semiconductormanufacturers and their electric utilities should worktogether to ensure voltage sag event root causeidentification processes exists.6.4.2.3 Analysis steps for electric utili ties to identifythe root cause of system faults include the following:Step 1 Locate the fault and identify what initiated thefault.Step 2 Investigate the underlying causes of the faultto discover the root cause.Step 3 Track faults and root causes in a database.Step 4 Identify corrective actions. 6.4.2.4 Some of the more obvious cor rective actionsinclude additional animal guards on exposed electricaldevices to reduce the effects from inadvertent touch.Additional patrols and early removal of birds nests,sources of nesting material, reduction in potentialroosting and nesting sites, sealing any possible entry toelectrical equipment against wildlife intrusion, anddesigns using larger phase spacing and higher Basic

&lt;!-- Page 28 --&gt;

SEMI F50-0200 © SEMI 2000 6 Impulse Insulation Levels (BIL) are just some of theways that events can be eliminated.6.4.3 Service Configurations6.4.3.1 Determine the factors that are fixed for thepurposes of improvement development and evaluation.Some examples include, but are not limited to, physicallocation of site, utility system configuration beyond theimmediate vicinity of the site, and electric ratestructures.6.4.3.2 Once the electrical reliability a nd powerquality needs of a semiconductor factory are identifiedand the reliability and power quality of the electricalnetwork in the area has been characterized, electricutility service configuration can be considered. Theelectric utility and the semiconductor manufacturershould jointly develop a plan that balances reliabilityand power quality. This plan should consider thefollowing service configuration options.6.4.3.3 High voltage service configura tions.6.4.3.3.1 Utility electrical service config urations havea significant effect on the levels of power quality andreliability. Semiconductor manufacturing facilities cantypically derive the highest service quality andreliability from electrical service provided at the highestvoltage level. By bringing service to the semiconductorfactory from the highest available voltage system,semiconductor facilities can eliminate their exposure toelectrical disturbances on lower voltage systems.Seldom are disturbances that result from eventsoriginating in lower voltage systems transferred into thehigher voltage systems to any significant degree.Utility industry studies have indicated approximately6075% fewer voltage sag events (below 70% ofnominal) on the high voltage systems.6.4.3.3.2 For plants with loads greater th an 10 MW,the highest voltage available is usually service at avoltage between 69 kV and 345 kV. Voltages abovethis range, while widely used by utilities, are notusually economical to adapt to loads less than 60 MWand may require lengthy regulatory approvals. If newoverhead power lines are required, environmental andpublic issues associated with locating the lines mayreduce access to higher voltage lines.6.4.3.4 Redundancy.6.4.3.4.1 All on-site facilities and intern al factorydistribution should have at least N+1 componentredundancy. Where N is the number of componentsrequired to operate for maximum loading conditionsand +1 indicates a single additional component that willoperate to maintain the system capability in the eventthat one of the original components is out-of-service. Ifthe plant is to be operated with no annual shutdowns for maintenance, then the system should be designed withenough redundancy to maintain every component in theplant without dropping service to any load. Thisrequires at least a dual feed system that originates withtwo or more utility sources and continues throughoutthe semiconductor factory with appropriate transferschemes to keep the loads energized at all times and totransfer loads without interruptions.6.4.3.4.2 The most reliable service is on e where thereare multiple sources connected in a network to thesemiconductor factory. This allows for adequate powersupply, even if one of the sources fails. If a network isnot available, a dual feed system can be configured toprovide an immediate transfer to the backup system inthe case of primary source failure, reducing outage timeto near zero. Additionally, if the two sources areindependent, a static transfer switch may increasequality to a level higher than that of a network. If onlyone source is available to a semiconductor factory witha load of less than five megawatts, an alternative is onsite generation combined with a voltage sag ride-through system.6.4.3.5 Minimize exposure.6.4.3.5.1 When choosing source configu rations, it isimportant to consider exposure at the semiconductorfactory site. The more line length the factory isconnected to, the more exposure there is.a) It might not be desirable to have three lines servingthe plant if one is a long line that is prone tofailures. As a rule of thumb, more than three linesconnected in a network may reduce quality withoutadding significantly to reliability.b) If service is taken from a distribution class circuit,then consider purchasing a so-called express ordedicated feeder from the utility to isolate the plantfrom neighboring facilities.c) Review the line routes with the utility and considerchanges to reduce exposures, such as: where thepoles are vulnerable to being struck by vehicles, orwhere trees are growing close to the transmissionlines. 6.4.4 Power Enhancements Technol ogies6.4.4.1 All disturbances will not be eli minated fromthe utility grid. In order to achieve the next step inplant protection, it may be necessary to implementsome type of custom power option. Custom power isso called because it is thought to be a custom solutiontailored to the needs of the process and the uniquesituation of the site. Custom power options usuallyinvolve some type of power enhancement andconditioning system. These power electronics systemsare most often connected between the semiconductor

&lt;!-- Page 29 --&gt;

SEMI F50-0200 © SEMI 20007 factory and the electric utility at the point of commoncoupling (also known as the electrical service point).Many custom power options include some energystorage to ride through the disturbance, but they areusually designed to carry the factory through onlymomentary interruptions. In fact, for large factories(&gt;10 MW) some available ride-through systems onlyoperate to boost the voltage during sags and will notcarry the factory site through even short outages. Thetrade-off is cost versus protection. The systems shouldbe economically evaluated as well as matchedtechnically to the needs of the site.6.4.4.2 Electric utility provided custom power optionsshould be balanced against factory system voltage sagimmunity covered in industry guide for factory systemsvoltage sag immunity.6.5 Select and Implement Improve ments6.5.1 Both the electric utility and the semiconductormanufacturer should agree criteria methodology forprioritizing improvements. The following are examplesof prioritization criteria. Expected frequency of disturbances. Impact of fault on electric utility andsemiconductor processing. Relative cost of system improvement. Ability of action to reduce effects.6.5.2 Select improvement to be imp lemented, identifythe schedules for installation, and define the newsystem performance expectations.6.5.3 Implement selected improvements.6.5.4 With identified fault tracking a nd root causeanalysis processes electric utilities will be in a positionto communicate the cause of events, their correctiveactions, and the impact of improvements. Results willbe both immediate and long-term, but to ensure that thecontinuous improvement process remains successful,the impacts of improvements should be tracked. Theresults of this tracking should provide feedback to thecontinuous improvement process as a whole. 7 Related Documents7.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI F42  Test Method for SemiconductorProcessing Equipment Voltage Sag ImmunitySEMI F47  Provisional Specification forSemiconductor Processing Equipment Voltage SagImmunitySEMI F49  Guide for Semiconductor FactorySystems Voltage Sag Immunity SEMI E51  Guide for Typical Facilities Services andTermination Matrix 7.2 IEEE Standards1 IEEE 141  IEEE Recommended Practice for ElectricPower Distribution for Industrial PlantsIEEE 446  IEEE Recommended Practice forEmergency and Standby Power Systems for Industrialand Commercial ApplicationsIEEE 493  IEEE Recommended Practice for theDesign of Reliable Industrial and Commercial PowerSystemsIEEE 1100  IEEE Recommended Practice forPowering and Grounding Sensitive ElectronicEquipmentIEEE 1250  IEEE Guide for Service to EquipmentSensitive to Momentary Voltage DisturbancesNOTE 3: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards.

R1-1 Typical Electric Utility SystemPerformanceR1-1.1 Although most large semiconductor sites areserved from dedicated substations, data collected fromutility (medium-voltage) distribution circuits can beuseful in establishing a baseline for electric utilitysystem performance. As part of the EPRI\*2Distribution Power Quality (DPQ) study, data wascollected for a two-year period from approximately 300different BMI PQNode monitors. These monitors werelocated on 100 different feeders at 24 geographicallydispersed utilities. The power quality database createdin conjunction with this study is probably the mostextensive in existence. The data derived from thisstudy provides a statistically based assessment of thelevel of power quality on electric utility distributioncircuits (voltage range from 4.16kV to 34.5kV).R1-1.2 Almost every category of power quality datawas collected in the DPQ study, however, only voltagesag and interruption data is assumed to be pertinent tothis activity. In the DPQ study, a voltage sag event wasinitiated when the rms voltage dropped below 95% ofnominal for one cycle (data analysis was performedonly for events with magnitudes less than or equal to90%). An interruption event was initiated when thevoltage dropped below 10% of nominal for 120seconds. Although waveforms were captured for mostsag and interruption events, almost all of the dataanalysis was performed on the basis of minimumvoltage magnitude (as a percentage on nominal) andmaximum duration during the event.R1-1.3 DPQ Key Results  The average interruption rate per site, per monthwas approximately 0.5. The average sag rate per site, per month wasapproximately 4 (10% &lt; V &lt; = 90%). The ratio of voltage sags to interruptions wasapproximately 10:1. 2 Electric Power Research Institute, Inc., 3412 Hillview Ave., PaloAlto, CA 94304-1395, USA  Almost all voltage sag events have only a singlecomponent. Most voltage sags had duration of less than 10cycles.R1-1.4 The Figure R1-1 represents a summary of thevoltage sag and interruption data in a contour format.The contour lines on the graph represent the expectednumber of disturbance events that are more severe(longer or deeper) than the duration and magnitudegrid. R1-2 Semiconductor Factory Site DisturbanceDataR1-2.1 The DPQ study provides a baseline of thepower quality that exists on typical utility distributionsystems. However, only one of the semiconductormanufacturing sites from which data was collected isserved from a typical utility distribution system.Fourteen of the fifteen semiconductor sites surveyedwere served from dedicated substations owned by eitherthe customer or the utility. A comparison betweenDPQ and semiconductor site data (for large facilities)indicates that application of DPQ data would yield amore restrictive tool tolerance standard. It isrecommended, therefore, that data from semiconductorsites be utilized to develop an initial curve and that thecurve be validated against DPQ data.R1-2.2 Voltage sag and interruption data wasaccumulated for 14 different semiconductormanufacturing sites geographically dispersedthroughout the United States. One additional site waslocated outside of the United States. Data representedin this report was provided by semiconductormanufacturing companies.R1-2.3 All of the data collected was in the form ofmagnitude and duration point values. Although thevalidity of characterizing the electrical systemperformance is this manner has been questioned, itremains the most common data format for disturbancedata.R1-2.4 The coverage of the disturbance data istypically represented as the product of number of years(or months) monitored and the number of monitorspresent. In this report, the unit for data coverage isMonitor-Years. One Monitor-Year of data is thequantity of data derived by one monitor for a one-yearperiod. The data for semiconductor sites covers 30.5

&lt;!-- Page 31 --&gt;

SEMI F50-0200 © SEMI 20009 Monitor-Years. The minimum coverage for a site was0.8 Monitor-Years (one monitor for 10 months). Thesite with the maximum coverage had eight Monitor-Years of data. The average for all sites wasapproximately 1.9 Monitor-Years.R1-2.5 Shown below is a scatter graph of all of the1076 disturbances that were reported. The graphrepresents the magnitudes and duration for all voltagesags and interruptions at all sites. The magnitude valueis the minimum voltage level during the sag representedas a percent of the nominal voltage. Also shown on thegraph is the pertinent portion of the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC) CBEMA-curve,contained in IEEE Standards 446 and 1100.R1-2.6 The total number of events on or below theCBEMA curve was 166. Thirteen of the fifteensemiconductor sites averaged at least one event belowthe CBEMA each year. The average number of eventsbelow CBEMA, per site, each year was approximately5.4. If the semiconductor manufacturers employed thenew CBEMA curve for a tolerance standard, mostwould have experienced a significant number ofequipment interruptions.

Eachmeasured or predicted sag will have a magnitude andduration that fits in only one of the 45 bins. Themagnitude bin is a range of sag voltages expressed as apercentage of nominal. The time bin is a range of sagdurations expressed as seconds. Each sag will haveassociated with it one magnitude and one time bin. Thenumber in each table entry will correspond to thenumber of sags that have magnitudes and times in thesame bins. Interruptions would go into the lower rowof bins according to the duration. The number binsmay vary depending on coordination needs for aparticular case. However, this selection of 45 bins isreasonably convenient.R2-1.3 For this example, assume each of the 45 binscontains one sag event. This means there are 45 sagsper year and the characteristics of each sag fits in aunique bin. The 15 bins in the lower-right corner have 3 Reprinted with the permission of The Institute of Electrical andElectronic Engineers, Inc. (IEEE), 445 Hoes Lane, P.O.

Worse than means the magnitude islower and the duration is longer. The row and columnheadings show only single values instead of ranges.For example, there are 15 sags in the 50% magnitude,0.4s entry of Table R1-2. The bold number 15 in TableR1-2 is the sum of all 15 individual bold entries inTable R1-1. This means 15 sags will have magnitudeless than or equal to 50% and duration longer than 0.4s.

SEMI F51-0200 © SEMI 20003 7 Considerations for Use in Ultra Pure De-ionized Water (UPDI)NOTE 2: See Figure 1. 7.1 De-ionized water is used in ma ny wafer processingsteps and shall not contribute any contaminants to theprocesses. The most common sealing requirements inDI water systems are filters, valves, flow and pressureregulators, and fittings.7.2 Contaminants in DI water fall primarily into threecategories. They are ion contamination, T.O.C.s andbacterial growth. Contaminant levels are usuallymeasured in parts per billion (PPB).7.3 Ion contamination problems ar e caused by anionicand cationic elements in DI water such as fluorides,chlorides, sulfates, etc. These can be leached fromseals as well as the DI plumbing.7.4 Cations (mostly metallic ions) are leached fromseals as well as the plumbing that delivers the DI water.In order to kill bacteria which have a propensity togrow in DI water, the water is either heated (80°C+),ozonated, or bombarded with UV light, or possibly acombination of these three elements. This poses uniqueproblems for seals used in the DI system and can causethe following problems: Contamination of the DI watercaused by T.O.C.s being leached from the seals andplumbing.7.5 Seal breakdown caused by ozo ne attack, or sealdeterioration due to UV exposure. T.O.C.s are of greatconcern since they can adhere to wafers and result indegraded oxide quality and hazy films. Ozone and UVdeterioration of the seals usually leads to particulatecontamination. These can be as small as single atomsor molecules to gross particle size contamination.7.6 Considerations: What method of sterilization (i.e., chemical,thermal or radiation)? Concerns for cations, anions, or T.O.C.s? Seal life expectation? 8 Considerations for Use in Corrosives(Acids, Bases), Oxidizers, and SolventsNOTE 3: See Figure 2. 8.1 Inorganic wet chemicals at hig h concentrationlevels and in some cases at elevated temperatures arereadily used in front-end semiconductor processing inthe fabrication of semiconductor devices. Mostcommon sealing requirements are in acid recirculationand chemical distribution systems (mostly BCDs).Component systems include pumps, filters, megasonicseals, gaskets for pipeline interfaces and valves. 8.2 Of primary concern when spec ifying a specificseal for an application are issues relating to resistanceto chemical reaction. Design considerations shouldinclude resistance to chemical breakdown, static vs.dynamic environments, pressure, temperature,leachables, particle generation.8.3 Chemical and Thermal Degrad ation involves theincompatibility of the seals to the process chemistries.An example is Hydroflouric Acid (HF) dissolvessilicone elastomers. The same is true of temperaturedegradation (i.e., Piranha or Phosphoric Acids) wherethe process temperature causes thermally andchemically induced effects on the seal. That alsocontributes to the mechanical failure of the seal.8.4 Leaching is most commonly a ssociated with metalfiller systems of the seal, which usually introducemetallic ions. This is a continuous occurrence as longas the seal is in the system.8.4.1 Particles  Particles can be th e result ofmechanical damage of the seal or as a result of leachingor chemical degradation or foreign material present onthe seal surface. Particles can end up on the wafer andcause defects.8.4.2 Summary  All cases of the a bovecontamination can create electrical shorts, voids, andunwanted doping.8.4.3 Solvents  Incompatibility of elastomers orseals with solvent chemistries may causecontamination.8.4.3.1 For example, there are degrees ofincompatibility:8.4.3.1.1 If the seal is dissolved by the s olvent, then acatastrophic failure occurs where the solvent leaks outof the liquid process loop. This is associated with mis-processed wafers.8.4.3.1.2 Another type of solvent seal in teraction is theswelling of the elastomer or the leaching of smallamounts of elastomer. Excessive swelling of theelastomer can result in premature seal failures and ahigher cost of ownership caused by increased frequencyof seal change outs. 9 Considerations for Use In ThermalProcessesNOTE 4: See Figure 3. 9.1 Diffusion processes are used p rimarily for growthof oxide layers and to anneal crystal damage caused byimplant. Diffusion furnaces are usually batch processequipment where the process atmosphere is constrainedwithin quartz tubes. The seals of these tubes areexposed to temperatures of 250300°C. This requires

&lt;!-- Page 38 --&gt;

SEMI F51-0200 © SEMI 2000 4 that the seals not only be capable of withstanding thesehigh temperatures but also that they not out-gas orpermeate adversely affecting the purity of the process.Also of concern is the possible particle generationcaused by the seals as they expand and contract due totemperature cycling (see Section 8.4.1).9.1.1 Factors include: Temperature capability of material and processtemperature. Static or dynamic state of seal. Proper sizing and fit of seal to gland. 10 Considerations for Use in Plasma Systems(Etch, CVD, and PVD)NOTE 5: See Figure 4. 10.1 Considerations for sealing components for use inplasma applications shall include proximity to plasma,plasma reactor temperature, chemical composition ofplasma, plasma energy, and chemical leaching by theplasma.10.2 Contamination from the inhere nt sealcomponents and particle generation is directly related toother considerations mentioned above.10.2.1 Factors include: Seal composition and resistance to chemical attack. Proximity to source and intensity of RF. Temperature capability of material and processtemperature. Static or dynamic state of seal. Proper sizing and fit of seal to gland.

SEMI F53-0600 © SEMI 20003 10.2 The user must have a working knowledge of therespective instrumentation, must practice properhandling of test components, and must understand goodlaboratory practices. The user should not operate thecomponents in such a manner as to exceed the ratings(i.e., pressure, temperature, flow, and voltage).10.3 Technical Precautions  The se tests are to beperformed in a shielded or screened room to preventpossible problems with nearby instrumentation orelectrical systems caused by the EM fields. At aminimum, the instrumentation associated with this testseries (see Figure 2) must be shielded from the EMfields to ensure their proper operation. 11 Preparation of Apparatus11.1 The test gas source and deliver y system must becapable of satisfying the test volume flow rate at aconstant pressure, ± 0.1 psia.11.2 The test gas source and deliver y system must becapable of delivering a gas at ambient temperature ±1°C for the duration of each analysis. The ambienttemperature shall be held to 22°C ± 1°C. 12 Calibration and Standardi zation12.1 For each test, verify that calibr ation of testequipment is up-to-date. 13 Procedure13.1 Install the MFC into the test se tup permanufacturers recommendations.13.2 Apply power to all devices sho wn in Figure 3 permanufacturers specifications. Allow the devices towarm up for the duration specified by the equipmentmanufacturer.13.3 Purge the system with nitrogen for a length oftime equal to ten times the amount of time it takes toreplace the system volume once, when the test MFC isat its full-scale rated flow rate.13.4 Close inlet shut-off valve. The n close the outletshut-off valve located adjacent to the MFC (see Figure2). Adjust the MFC setpoint to zero flow. Wait for thesignals to become stable. Record the following on thedata sheet: MFC indicated flow, Flow standard flow, Ambient temperature, Gas temperature, and Gas pressure. 13.5 Ensure that the inlet and outlet shut-off valvesadjacent to the MFC (see Figure 2) are open. Adjustthe MFC setpoint to 50%. Ensure that allmanufacturers recommended conditions are met for theMFC. Once the output signals become stable, recordthe MFC output signal, the flow standard output signal,the ambient and gas temperature, and the gas pressureon the data sheet in Table 1.13.6 Ensure that the MFC power le ads and control sig-nal cables are shielded in the area that will be irradiatedby the EM fields. The cable shielding shall be intact upto the connector. The type of shielding and connectorshall be recorded on the data sheet in Table 1.13.7 Radiated Electric Field Suscep tibility (RS-03)13.7.1 Testing from 14 kHz to 20 MH z:13.7.1.1 Mount the parallel element ant enna on atripod at a distance of one meter from the controller andconnect the antenna to the audio power amplifier usingthe 50-ft length of RG-58 coaxial cable (see Figure 3).Set the switch to low frequency range.13.7.1.2 Connect the amplifier input to the signalgenerator output.13.7.1.3 Turn on amplifier and signal g enerator.13.7.1.4 Using the X10 probe, connect the scopeacross the antenna terminals.NOTE 2: It is important to use the X10 probe rather than acoax that terminates in 50 ohms. The audio amplifier will notdrive the required voltage into 50 ohms. 13.7.1.5 Set frequency output of the sig nal generatorto 14 kHz.13.7.1.6 Turn off signal generator mod ulation and setvoltage across the antenna input connector at 35-V rms.NOTE 3: With this voltage applied to the antenna atfrequencies below one MHz, the required field strength of 10V/m at a distance of one meter from the antenna should beestablished. 13.7.1.7 If, at any frequency, the requir ed voltagecannot be developed across the antenna terminals, set tothe maximum possible without exceeding equipmentratings.13.7.1.8 When voltage is set, turn on modulation andadjust for 50% amplitude modulation with the internalone kHz source.13.7.1.9 Check operation of the control ler in thepresence of this radiated field.
