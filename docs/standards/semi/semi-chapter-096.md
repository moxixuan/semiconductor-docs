SEMI C6.7-93 © SEMI 1993, 20021 SEMI C6.7-93 (Reapproved 1102)PARTICLE SPECIFICATION FOR GRADE 10/0.2 NITROGEN IN HIGHPRESSURE GAS CYLINDERS This specification was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility ofthe North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on July 21, 2002. Initially available at www.semi.org October 2002; to be published November2002. Originally published in 1993. 1 Purpose1.1 The purposes of this document are (1) to set amaximum permissible particle concentration for 10/0.2grade cylinder nitrogen, and (2) to describe a referencemethod for its verification. 2 Scope2.1 This specification applies to nitrogen contained inhigh pressure gas cylinders; it is not applicable topipeline gases.2.2 A nitrogen cylinder consists of three components:(1) a cylinder bottle, (2) compressed nitrogen containedwithin, and (3) a cylinder valve. Each component canbe a particle source. This specification applied to thetotal number of particles detected in the gas as obtainedfrom the cylinder under a prescribed condition. Noconsideration is given to the origin of the particles.2.3 It is known that pressure reduction, if notcontrolled, can produce a large number of artifactparticles through nucleation and condensation. To avoidthis complication, this specification adopts particlecounters that can be operated at a pressure up to 200 bar(3000 psi), eliminating the need for pressure reductionand its associated problems.2.4 It is known that particle content in cylinder gasesvaries with time because particles can be lost tocylinder walls by diffusion or sedimentation, anddetached from cylinder walls by flow pulses ormechanical shocks. It is important to measure particleconcentration under the worst conditions whichrepresent typical handling of gas cylinders. Thisspecification describes a standard shock test that fulfillsthe above requirements and provides a procedure tocount particles immediately after the shock.2.5 If this test method is to be used for more than onecylinder, then each cylinder must be tested. It is knownthat particle contamination in cylinder gases is a strongfunction of the handling history of the individualcylinders. Cylinders in the same batch of filling areusually returned from various customers after variousperiods of service. Uniform quality can not be assumedfor the same batch of cylinders unless each of them hasgone through a dedicated process that erases the memory of previous history prior to filling. Therefore,batch sampling at 10% or 20% cannot be acceptedbecause of the significant differences among cylinders.2.6 The requirement of 100% sampling restricts thetotal amount of gas in each cylinder that can be used forsampling purposes. This restriction, in turn, calls forcertain relaxation of the statistical requirement forparticle sampling at low concentration levels.2.7 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Terminology3.1 Variables XBi = Observed particle concentration in the ith sampleinterval of the backgroundXMi = Observed particle concentration in the ith sampleinterval before shocksXNi = Observed particle concentration in the ith sample aftershocksNB= Number of sample intervals of the backgroundNM = Number of sample intervals before shocksNN= Number of sample intervals after shocksBX = Averaged observed particle concentration of thebackgroundMX = Averaged observed particle concentration beforeshocksNX = Averaged observed particle concentration aftershocksXP = Calculated particle concentration before shocksXQ= Calculated particle concentration after shocksSB= Standard deviation of BXSM = Standard deviation of MXSN= Standard deviation of NXSE P = Standard deviation of XPSE Q= Standard deviation of XQ

This value isdetermined at ambient pressure by the instrumentmanufacturer using 0.2 m monodisperse particles anda reference counter with a proven counting efficiency of100% at 0.2 m. Note that the nominal flow rate of theHPC is fixed at any pressure but the sample flow rateshould be adjusted to within 5% of the manufacturersspecified flow rate, for the pressure and reported itsequivalent standard flow rate at ambient pressure (1bar).4.2 Impact Shock Device  A device that canreproducibly impart an impact shock of 10 4 m/sec2 witha 10% tolerance to a gas cylinder. A convenient set upas shown in Figure 1 can be used. A steel ball isattached to a chain with the other end fastened to thetest cylinder. The ball is lifted to form a 90 angle withthe cylinder, is released to follow a 90 free fall arc, andstrikes the test cylinder. The desired ball mass andchain length are to be determined by monitoring thecorresponding shock intensity by an accelerometer. Fora typical 44 liter cylinder, a ball mass of 160 gm and achain length of 60 cm can produce the desired impactshock. 5 Test Method5.1 Determine the averaged background concentration( BX ) by passing particle-free, compressed nitrogenthrough the HPC. Count a minimum of 5 sampleintervals, each of at least 6 standard liters (0.2 SCF) ortaken over a time period of 6 minutes, whichever isgreater. A high purity gas filter can be used to removeparticles greater than 0.2 m. Calculate BX as definedin Section 3. BX must not exceed 1 particle per 30second liters.5.2 Set up the experimental apparatus as shown inFigure 2. Directly connect the test cylinder to a High-pressure Particle Counter (HPC), a pressure gauge, anda Flow Control Device (FCD). Note that NOREGULATOR is used before the HPC. The samplingline should be clean and as short as possible. The flowcontrol device can be a metering valve and a flowmeteror a critical orifice.5.3 Determine MX by opening the cylinder valve andcount the particles for at least 5 sample intervals, eachof at least 6 standard liters (0.2 SCF) or taken over atime of 6 minutes, whichever is greater. Calculate XPand SE P as defined in Section 3.5.4 Apply 4 impact shocks of approximately 104m/sec2 each, 10 sec apart, to the bare surface of the testcylinder. Each shock whould be applied at theapproximate vertical midpoint of the cylinder; the fourshocks should be separated from each other byapproximately 90 circumferentially.5.5 Determine NX by counting the particles after theshocks for at least 5 sample intervals, each of at least 6standard liters (0.2 SCF) or taken over a time of 6minutes, whichever is greater. The sampling should becompleted within 2 hours after the shocks. Calculate XQand SE Q as defined in Section 3. 6 Specification6.1 Maximum Permissible Particle Concentration 10 particles per 30 standard liters.6.2 The specification will be considered met if thecalculated concentration of particles plus two standarderrors does not exceed 10 particles per 30 standardliters for both measurements before and after the impactshocks, i.e.:X P + 2SE P ≤ 10 particles/30 standard litersandX Q + 2SE Q ≤ 10 particles/30 standard liters

SEMI C14-95 © SEMI 1995, 20021 SEMI C14-95 (Reapproved 1102)TEST METHOD FOR PARTICLE SHEDDING PERFORMANCE OF 25 cmGAS FILTER CARTRIDGES This test method was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility ofthe North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on August 29, 2002. Initially available at www.semi.org September 2002; to be publishedNovember 2002. Originally published in 1995; previously published in 1996.1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this document is to define acomprehensive standard test sequence to deriveparticle-related qualification data for 25 cm (10 inch)filter cartridges. 2 Scope2.1 This test method defines a particle sheddingevaluation method for 25 cm filter cartridges of variousmedia (e.g., PTFE, PVDF, polycarbonate, nylon, andpolysulfone) commonly used individually or inassemblies to remove particles from gas lines. The filtercartridges are separable from the housings which can becleaned and tested independently.2.2 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 These test methods do not apply to point-of-use(POU) filters, for which separate methods have beendeveloped.3.2 Cartridge filter performance cannot becharacterized by a single data point, as conditions ofuse (e.g., pressure drop, transient pressure surges)determine the importance of a particular measurement.A sequence of tests, designed to measure filterresponses under various conditions, is necessary whenevaluating cartridge filters.3.3 The order of the test sequence will affect the testresults, and it is designed for fair comparisons ofdifferent aspects of filter operations. Hence, it isimportant to follow the prescribed test sequence. 4 Summary of Method4.1 The test sequence (shown schematically in Figure1) consists of three steps:1. Break-in2. Pulse 3. Final Purge 5 Apparatus and Facility5.1 Gas Source  Clean, dry nitrogen or dry air withless than 0.5 ppm moisture and less than 0.5 ppm totalhydrocarbons.5.2 Particle Detectors  A condensation nucleuscounter (CNC) with a counting efficiency of 50%, asreported by the manufacturer, at 0.01 m isrecommended to measure total particle concentrationgreater than 0.01 m.5.3 Test Environments  A clean room environment isnot required during testing; however, the testcomponent should be unpacked and assembled in aClass 100 clean area to prevent ambient contamination.5.4 Configuration for Break-in Test  The schematicof the test setup apparatus is shown in Figure 2. Allcomponents used in the test apparatus, including theflowmeter, valves, tubing, and filter housing, are 2.5 cm(1 inch) components or have 2.5 cm (1 inch) inlet andoutlet connections. The apparatus consists of (1) adifferential pressure sensor that can accurately measurep in the range 0.01 bar (0.15 psid) to 0.2 bar (3.0 psid)between the upstream and downstream pressure of thetest component, (2) a flow control system that permitsinstantaneous change of flow corresponding to a p of0.01 bar to 0.2 bar across the filter, and (3) a CNCdownstream of the test filter.5.5 Configuration for Pulse Test  The schematic ofthe test setup is the same as the break-in test.5.6 Sample Installation  Reasonable precautionsshould be taken when installing the test filter or spoolpiece to avoid particle contamination of the systemfrom ambient air. These precautions may include, butare not limited to, installation in a Class 100 laminarflow area, installation in a purged glove bag or othercontrolled ambient enclosure, use of a purge flowdownstream of the sample point so that all parts of thesystem are under purge, isolation, or termination of theCNC sample flow, and isolation of the isokineticsampler exhaust from ambient.5.7 Sampling System Design  Customary practicesshould be employed for the design of the sampling

Care should be taken to provide an adequateexhaust length so that back diffusion of particles doesnot affect the system background at 2 times thesampling flow rate. This length will depend upon theparticle concentration in the ambient environment andother factors. 6 Procedure6.1 Static Background Test6.1.1 This test applies to all apparatus described in thisdocument and should be performed prior to other tests.6.1.2 Remove the filter cartridge from the filterhousing and replace the test filter in Figure 2 with theempty housing.6.1.3 Purge the system at 100 m3/hr (3530 standardcubic feet per hour (scfh)).

SEMI C15-95 © SEMI 1995, 20021 SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102)TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS This test method was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility ofthe North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on July 21, 2002. Initially available at www.semi.org October 2002; to be published November2002. Originally published in 1995. 1 Purpose1.1 This test will determine whether or not the quantityof moisture delivered by a gaseous moisture standard isin agreement with that predicted for the standard on thebasis of physical principles. It is expected that thismethod will be used to validate moisture standardsbefore they are first placed in use, when deviation fromexpected performance is likely or suspected, and atother times as seems necessary.1.2 The test method assumes the existence of a reliablemoisture analyzer. Although extensive precautions aredescribed to ensure the validity of the analyzer, it isalways possible that the test could yield a faulty resultthrough some unforeseen defect in the analyticalequipment.1.3 Given that moisture generation is subject to manypitfalls, it will be required that the predicted moistureconcentration delivered by the standard and themeasurement of that level by the analyzer beindependent, and that they agree. The level ofagreement can vary depending on the degree ofprecision claimed for the moisture standard, but in anycase the measured and predicted results should bewithin 10% over the entire range of the moisturestandard. If not, then the validation should be repeatedafter verifying the physical measurement upon whichthe prediction is based and any other parametersdeemed suspect. 2 Scope2.1 This method is intended to be applicable to anytype of gaseous standard delivering a quantity ofmoisture in the ppm range or lower, provided thedelivered moisture concentration is predictable on thebasis of fundamental principles of physics. Thus, anystandards which rely solely on characterization byanalysis are specifically excluded.2.2 As part of this test, a procedure is described forqualifying certain moisture analyzers consideredsuitable for use in qualifying moisture standards.Moisture analyzers intended for other applications mayneed to satisfy different criteria.2.3 As the most accurate and reliable moistureanalyzers currently available operate primarily in theppm range, this test focuses on validation of moisture standards in this range. The need for ppb moisturestandards is addressed by specifying procedures forreducing the output of ppm moisture standards to theppb range.2.4 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.3 Limitations3.1 If no higher level of accuracy is specified by theuser, then a moisture standard shown to be valid by thismethod will generate moisture levels which deviatefrom the expected values by no more than 20%. Themethod leaves open to the user the option of usingsound statistical methods to specify that a givenmoisture standard will generate levels showing a closeragreement with expected values.3.2 Validation based on this test method is good for alimited time. The acceptable interval betweenvalidations depends on the nature of the standard and isnot addressed by this method. Thus any citation ofvalidation results should be accompanied by the date(s)on which validation was performed. 4 Referenced DocumentsThis method is based upon principles outlined in F.Mermoud, M.D. Brandt, and J.J.F. McAndrew, LowLevel Moisture Generation, Analytical Chemistry, 63(2): 198-202 (1991). 5 Device under Test (Test Specimen)5.1 Definition of a Moisture Standard  A moisturestandard is defined to be any device capable ofdelivering a flow of humidified gas at controlledpressure, with no input being provided by the userexcept nitrogen of UHP grade (moisture &lt; 1 ppm) or airof equivalent purity. Any device, such as a permeationtube, which can provide a predictable amount ofmoisture but does not include a means to deliver gas toand from it, will not be considered a moisture standardby itself. A device which requires gas of higher puritythan UHP grade will include a purifier capable ofpurifying UHP nitrogen to this level.

&lt;!-- Page 15 --&gt;

SEMI C15-95 © SEMI 1995, 2002 2 5.2 Examples of Moisture Standards  Someexamples of moisture standards and the principles uponwhich they are based are as follows: Permeation and effusion tube standards. Thesemust include purification means and some meansof regulating the outlet pressure. The moisturedelivery rate can be calculated based on the weightloss of the tube. Cylinder standards. The standard will include aregulator specified for use with the cylinder. Themoisture concentration delivered can be calculatedbased on that added to the cylinder in preparation.A minimum use pressure must be specified. Methods based on saturation of gas with watervapor at a fixed temperature and pressure. Themoisture concentration in the gas may then becalculated from a knowledge of the saturationvapor pressure of water over a plane of the purephase of ice at the saturation temperature and of theinteraction virial coefficients of the gas-vapormixture. The two-pressure and two-temperaturemethods are refinements of this approach requiringadditional chambers whose temperature andpressure must be known.5.3 Dilution of Standards  For all moisturegeneration methods, lower concentrations can begenerated by dynamic dilution (i.e., by combining aknown flow of the standard gas with a known flow ofdilution gas). A diluted standard is acceptableprovided: The standard is validated at high concentration(with the lowest concentration validated being nomore than 10,000 times the use concentration), The dilution gas has a moisture level below thestated precision of the analysis (to be verified usingthe same flow path as during the subsequentanalysis, and at the lowest flow rate to be used), The absolute accuracies of the dilution systemcomponents are verified by comparison with areliable flow standard, The linearity of the dilution system can bedemonstrated over the entire range of operation.The last criterion is particularly important wheneversome portion of the combined flow is discarded, asmixing problems can easily arise at large dilutionfactors. 6 Procedure6.1 Validation will be performed using a hygrometerwhose output can be directly related to the moisture concentration on the basis of physical laws or using ananalyzer which has recently been calibrated bycomparison with such an analyzer.6.2 Hygrometer Qualification6.2.1 Primary Hygrometers  Hygrometers can becertified by the National Institute for Standards andTechnology (NIST) in the U.S., and similar certificationis available in other countries, although the lowestconcentration at which certification is available willvary. Repeated certification at yearly or longer intervalscan be used to establish reliability. A hygrometer whichhas been certified by a national standards laboratory to1 ppm (or lower) moisture in air or nitrogen, and forwhich reliability has been established over a periodgreater than or equal to that which has elasped sincecertification occurred, is acceptable for validation of amoisture standard and will be referred to as a primaryhygrometer.Because hygrometers which are suitable for use asprimary hygrometers may be less convenient or lessreadily available than other hygrometers, the use ofother hygrometers for validation is also acceptable,provided adequate precautions are taken to ensure thatthey are operating correctly. These precautions (to bedescribed below) require using a moisture source tocompare a secondary hygrometer with the primaryhygrometer. The moisture source need not have beenvalidated in this case.6.2.2 Validation of Secondary Hygrometers Secondary hygrometers may be validated by comparingtheir output with a primary hygrometer when connectedin parallel to the same moisture source. The degree ofagreement required can vary depending upon theprecision to be claimed, but in any case the differencein reading between the two hygrometers should be nomore than 10% at any point. Comparison should bemade at four moisture concentrations or at two perdecade of proposed operation, whichever is less. Half ofthe comparisons should be made while increasingconcentration and half while decreasing, including atleast one comparison at the highest point of theconcentration range. The first and last comparisonsshould be at the lowest point of the concentration range.For example, in order to validate a hygrometer foroperation between 1 and 100 ppm, it would beacceptable to generate moisture levels at 1, 30, 100, 50,1 ppm (in that order) and compare the primary with thesecondary hygrometer. Comparison of the measuredlevel between the two 1 ppm tests provides a readyindication of hysteresis in the system. If the secondaryhygrometer requires calibration using its own standard,calibration should be effected before validation.However, it is acceptable to adjust the calibration in

&lt;!-- Page 16 --&gt;

SEMI C15-95 © SEMI 1995, 20023 order to improve agreement with the primaryhygrometer.6.2.3 Frequency of Hygrometer Validation  Thefrequency of validation required for a secondaryhygrometer will vary dependent upon the performanceestablished for hygrometers of the same general type.If three successive monthly validations show continuingagreement (within 10%) with the primary hygrometerwithout calibration adjustment, the validation intervalmay be extended to three months. Similar extensions ofvalidation interval to six months and one year may bemade if no drift is apparent and no calibrationadjustments are necessary to bring the secondary within10% of the primary at all points.6.3 Validation Procedure for Moisture Standards6.3.1 Validation Within the Range of an AvailablePrimary Hygrometer  If a primary hygrometer isavailable, and its detection limit is no higher than thelowest concentration at which it is desired to use themoisture standard, this is the simplest case. Use thestandard to generate four concentration levels or twoper decade (whichever is less) in which the standardwill be used, half of the concentrations generated whileincreasing concentration, half while decreasing,including at least one comparison at the highest point ofthe concentration range. The first and last comparisonsshould be at the lowest point of the concentration range.If the generated levels, calculated according to the basicproperties of the generator (e.g., weight loss of apermeation tube) agree with the measured levels towithin 10%, the standard may be considered validatedwith an accuracy of 10%. Higher validation accuracyrequires better agreement. It has been assumed that theprecision of the primary hygrometer, as determined bya national standards laboratory, is much better than10% and may be neglected for validation at the 10%level. Validation at higher accuracy requires explicitconsideration of the certification precision.If a standard only generates one level, connect it to thehygrometer and allow to come to equilibrium.Assuming the equilibrium level agrees with thecalculated level of the generator, disconnect thehygrometer and bring it to equilibrium with either drynitrogen or ambient air. Then reconnect the moisturestandard and reestablish equilibrium between thestandard and the hygrometer. Disconnect again andrepeat a third time. If the three measurements agreewithin 10% among themselves and with the generatedlevel, the standard is validated.It is implicit in the above that the background moisturelevel of the system be less than 50 ppb so that it can beneglected for all measurements above 1 ppm with anerror no larger than 5%. We can usually neglect background moisture in validating moisture standardsin this concentration range.6.3.2 Validation Using Secondary Hygrometers  Ifno primary hygrometer is available, then validation canbe performed using a secondary hygrometer. If thelowest concentration to be generated using the standardis no higher than the detection limit of the primaryhygrometer used for validation of the secondaryhygrometer, then the procedure is as above, except thatthe secondary must first have been validated over theentire concentration range which the standard will beused to generate. (A secondary hygrometer and amoisture standard can be validated simultaneously ifthe primary and secondary hygrometers are connectedin parallel to the moisture standard.)When assessing the accuracy of validation using asecondary hygrometer, it is necessary to take intoaccount the precision of the comparison of the primaryhygrometer with the secondary hygrometer as well asthe precision of the comparison of the generator withthe secondary hygrometer. 7 Practice for Generating ppb MoistureStandardsThe detection limit of the primary hygrometer willgenerally be on the order of 1 ppm, whereas it willfrequently be necessary to use the moisture standard atconcentrations below this level, by a factor of as muchas 10,000. Therefore, valid methods for reducingconcentration are necessary.7.1 Dilution of Validated Moisture Standards  If amoisture standard validated in accordance with Section6.2 or Section 6.2.1 is diluted with a zero gas streamsatisfying the criteria of Section 5.3, then the resultantdiluted standard may be considered valid and may beused for calibration of analyzers, such as APIMS.7.2 Consideration of Background Moisture  In anyppb or lower moisture measurement, it is necessary toconsider the background moisture level due tooutgassing in the sampling system and residualmoisture in the generator + analyzer. Often thebackground will be sufficiently large that it must betaken into account explicitly. The background moisturelevel is the moisture concentration measured in theabsence of a moisture source (i.e., when the driestcarrier gas available is fed to the analyzer using thesame flow rate and flow path as is used for the samplegas during analysis).It should be noted that the importance of thebackground level increases for measurements at lowconcentrations, and that the background level issensitive to the materials of construction, to the design

&lt;!-- Page 17 --&gt;

SEMI C15-95 © SEMI 1995, 2002 4 of the moisture generator, and to its operatingtemperature.If the background moisture concentration is B (ppb),the concentration delivered by the moisture standard isC (ppb) and the dilution factor x is given by x = flow of moisture standardtotal flow (1) then c, the delivered moisture concentration is given (inppb) by c = (1  x ) B + xC (2) The accuracy of calibration will reflect the combinedaccuracy of the standard and the dilution system,together with the accuracy of the backgrounddetermination; all must be taken into account in anystatement of analytical uncertainty.7.3 Changing the Range of Performance of a MoistureStandard  If a moisture standard is based on somedevice which is believed to deliver moisture at aconstant rate, such as a permeation or effusion tube, theconcentration range delivered by the moisture standardmay be changed by delivering a substantially differentflow of carrier gas. This usually requires changing amass flow controller or other flow control device insidethe standard for a flow controller of a different range.This may be done provided the new flow controller'sperformance is verified by comparison with a reliableflow standard.The definition of dilution factor is revised to x = flow generated by original flow controllerflow generated by new flow controller (3) The background, B, is determined by removing thepermeation or effusion tube from the system andcapping off its point of connection, or by preventing thesource from delivering moisture by some other means.The same equation for c applies as does the statementregarding analytical uncertainty.7.4 Validation at Intermediate Concentrations  Itmay be desirable to validate a moisture standard at aconcentration below the detection limit of the primaryhygrometer, if that standard is to be used for very low-level generation. For example, if a standard based on apermeation device is intended to generate levelsbetween 0.5 and 5 ppb at flows of 1 to 10 slm, it couldbe validated in the 0.5 to 5 ppm range using a frost-point hygrometer by replacing the flow controller with one operating between 1 and 10 sccm1 . However, sucha flow controller may not be readily available and isdifficult to calibrate in any case. Instead, it is preferableto use a flow controller operating between 50 and 500sccm to generate concentrations between 0.1 and 1.0ppm together with a secondary hygrometer having adetection limit no higher than 50 ppb. This procedure isacceptable, provided that the secondary hygrometer has been validated witha primary hygrometer at least at one point in therange to be used for validation of the moisturestandard, the moisture concentrations generated by thestandard and that observed by the secondaryhygrometer agree throughout the range ofvalidation of the standard.This approach could lead to errors if the hygrometerand the standard each exhibited a deviation frompredicted performance, but these deviations would haveto be the same and cancel, which is extremely unlikely.In the case of operation in this mode, it will benecessary to know the background level of the systemand use this as an input to the calculation of generatedmoisture levels. To continue the example of apermeation based system, if the permeation ratedetermined by weight loss is P (ng/min), the flow rateof carrier gas is F (sccm), K is a factor to convertng/min to sccm moisture, and B is the experimentallydetermined background, then the generated moisturelevel, cgen, is calculated according to c gen = KPF + B (4) For other moisture generation systems, it is similarlypossible to calculate the generated moisture level whiletaking into account the background level of the system.This assumes that the background moistureconcentration is constant, which is only approximatelytrue. Thus, in applying this approach, in addition to thesources of error mentioned above, the estimate ofanalytical uncertainty must also include the variation inbackground moisture. 8 Validation Precision and AccuracyThis procedure does not explicitly consider theestimation of the accuracy of a moisture standard in 1 It is assumed that, although flow controllers are calibrated using astandard, no unusual measures are used to enable the full accuracy ofcalibration to be achieved over the entire range of the flow controller.In practice this means that a flow controller has a usable dynamicrange of 10-100% of its flow rating.

The accuracyrequired in validation will vary with the proposedapplication of the moisture standard and may be left tothe discretion of the user of the procedure. It isrecommended that a propagation of errors calculationbe carried out to estimate the accuracy of the validation.If no such calculation is made, and the minimumcriteria of the procedure are followed, it is estimatedthat a validated moisture generator may output moisturelevels which differ from the true values by up to 20%.

SEMI C52-0301 © SEMI 20011 SEMI C52-0301SPECIFICATION FOR THE SHELF LIFE OF A SPECIALTY GAS This specification was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility ofthe European Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the European Regional Standards Committee onDecember 20, 2000. Initially available at www.semi.org January 2001; to be published March 2001. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this document is to defineterminology and to recommend minimum periods forthe shelf lives of specialty gases. It is meant to provideconsistency in terminology among gas suppliers and toprovide a general guideline for users of these gases. 2 Scope2.1 This document applies to the s helf life of properlypackaged, filled and analyzed specialty gases as storedor supplied by a specialty gas manufacturer or supplier.In this document, shelf life is viewed from a qualitypoint of view. The document does not address safetyaspects associated with the prolonged storage of gases.2.2 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Referenced StandardsNone. 4 Terminology4.1 container  a lecture bottle, c ylinder, cylinderpack, drum or any other vessel which is used to supplya specialty gas.4.2 residual level  The amount o f product, as afraction of the fill weight or fill pressure, which shouldbe left in a container in order to minimize the impact onmanufacturing processes of the higher level ofimpurities in the last gas fraction from a container.4.3 shelf life  the period of time for which thespecification of a gas is guaranteed by the supplier,starting from the time of analysis. It defines the periodfor which the supplier guarantees the actual level ofimpurities, as analyzed, to remain at or below thespecification limit for a particular gas grade. 5 Requirements5.1 Factors Affecting the Shelf Lif e of a Specialty Gas Shelf life is a function of the following factors:a. Thermal stability of the gas b. Quality of the container and valve material selection leak tightnessc. Time-dependent reactions between gas and impurities gas and packaging materialsd. Filling and analytical operationse. Transport and storage conditionsf. Amount of product in the container5.1.1 The integrity of the valve is a k ey factordetermining the shelf life of a gas, in particular for lowvapor pressure gases. Time dependent reactions can besignificantly reduced by purification of the gas to alevel where impurities no longer have a significanteffect over time, and by selection of proper packagingmaterials. Chemical and physical treatment of theinternal container surface and/or passivation of thissurface before filling also reduces the effect of time-dependent reactions. For material and gas compatibilityinformation, please refer to the individual SEMI gasstandards.5.2 Classification of Specialty Gas es on the Basis ofShelf Life  While there are a large number ofspecialty gases used in semiconductor manufacturing,for the purpose of defining shelf lives, they can bedivided into four groups. It should be noted that forexample chemically reactive gases are sometimesclassified as non-reactive in the table below as theclassification is done from a shelf-life point of viewonly.5.2.1 Non-reactive  Under normal storageconditions, these gases do not react with ambient air,the packaging materials or the impurities commonlyfound in the specialty gas.5.2.2 Reactive  These gases react either withambient air or standard packaging materials.5.2.3 Corrosive  These gases reac t with packagingmaterials usually in the presence of traces of moisture.5.2.4 Unstable  These gases are th ermally unstableand spontaneously decompose over time.

For thisreason, no maximum shelf life periods arerecommended as these will depend on the level ofanalytical data collected by the manufacturer orsupplier.5.4 Mixtures  The shelf life of a mixture isrecommended to be equal to the shelf life of thecomponent in the mixture with the lowest shelf life. Forexample, the minimum shelf life of a reactive gas in anon-reactive gas matrix would be 24 months. The shelflife of a mixture should apply both to the impurityspecifications and to the assay of the mixture. 5.4.1 Special attention should be pai d to thepreparation of the package for mixtures containing lessthan 1,000 ppm of a component. At such levels,adsorption effects may reduce the shelf life andminimization of the package internal surface roughnessand/or passivation of the surface may be required.5.5 Residual Level  The impact of the depletion of acontainer on impurity levels is still a matter of debateamong gas suppliers. In general, the impurity levels ofthe first gas fraction from a container will differ fromthe last gas fraction. In particular moisture levels tendto rise at lower gas pressures as a result of the relativeincrease in importance of the internal container walland its adsorbed moisture. In addition, in liquefiedgases the co-existence of both a gas phase and a liquidphase can have a measurable effect on the distributionof impurities over the gas fractions. It is argued that atthe point of liquid-dry some impurities, which prefersolution in the liquid phase over the gas phase, may seea dramatic rise. It is therefore recommended to alwaysleave an amount of product in the container and toavoid a situation of liquid dry (i.e., when all of theliquid phase of a liquefied gas has been used).

Sample Peak AreaStandard Peak Area  Concentrationof Standard = Concentrationof Sample9.3 Total Hydrocarbons  This procedure is for thedetermination of total hydrocarbons (THC) in oxygenusing a continuous flow flame ionization detectorequipped total hydrocarbon analyzer. (See Notes 2, 3,4.)NOTE 2: The 0-1 range can be used provided that zero andspan gas standards in oxygen with known levels ofhydrocarbons between 0-1 ppm are used in the calibration ofthe analyzer.NOTE 3: As the flow rate and heat capacity of the matrix gasaffect the instrument output, the zero and span gas matricesmust coincide with that of the sample gas.NOTE 4: The effective response of a flame ionizationdetector-equipped total hydrocarbon analyzer to different hydrocarbons can vary and must be approximated. However,the response of the most common hydrocarbon impurities inoxygen can be accurately totaled and compared to methane.9.3.1 Detection Limit  0.1 ppm.9.3.2 Flow Requirements9.3.2.1 High purity, hydrocarbon-free (less than 1.0ppm) hydrogen: 3540 mL/min or 40% hydrogen ineither helium or nitrogen matrix at 7580 mL/min.9.3.2.2 Dry, hydrocarbon-free (less than 1.0 ppm) air:350400 mL/min.9.3.2.3 Set sample flow rates in accordance with theinstrument manufacturers instructions.9.3.3 Calibration Standards9.3.3.1 Zero oxygen with known quantity ofhydrocarbons at less than 0.5 ppm level.9.3.3.2 The upper level span gas must be in oxygen andthe CH 4 level must not exceed 4 times the concentrationof the specification.9.3.4 Operating Procedure9.3.4.1 Do not change the flow settings for hydrogen,air, and sample once established.9.3.4.2 Introduce the zero oxygen with known quantityof hydrocarbons and, using the 010 ppm range, set theneedle (or output) to read the correct level using thezero adjust knob.9.3.4.3 Introduce the span gas standard in oxygen and,using the span adjust knob, set the needle (or outputreading) to match the level of hydrocarbons in the spangas.9.3.4.4 Introduce oxygen sample into the analyzer andread the quantity of hydrocarbons on the analyzermeter. The result may not exceed the specification inSection 7 of this standard.9.4 Water  This procedure is for the determination oftrace moisture (water) in oxygen using a continuousflowing, cooled-surface condensation, dewpoint/frost-point hygrometer. (See Notes 5, 6, 7.)NOTE 5: The sampling system and hygrometer must bedesigned to operate under the sample pressure, or the samplepressure must be reduced (by a regulator with a diaphragm ofstainless steel or other suitable material) to accommodate thepressure restrictions of the analytical hygrometer.NOTE 6: The National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) provides calibration services for the thermometersused in dewpoint/frostpoint hygrometers.NOTE 7: This method is not applicable if other constituentsin the gas will condense before water vapor, e.g., carbondioxide and/or oil contamination.

Follow the manufacturersrecommendations to create the temperatures needed.9.4.4.4 Continue to verify the dewpoint/frostpoint forat least 30 minutes after a stable reading has beenconfirmed.9.4.4.5 Correct the dewpoint reading from themeasured pressure to 1 atm of pressure. The result maynot exceed the specification in Section 7 of thisstandard.9.5 Assay of Oxygen  This procedure describes theassay of oxygen using an Orsat device. This is avolumetric determination of nonabsorbable/reactablegas.9.5.1 Method Capability  99.9% Oxygen.9.5.2 Instrument Parameters  See Figure 1.9.5.2.1 Equipment: 1-100 mL calibrated certified burette, calibratedevery 0.1 mL for the top 5 mL equipped with a 3-way stopcock on the top. 3-250 mL aspirator bottles. 1 one-hole rubber stop.  1-1/16 in OD soft copper wire made into hollowcoils 3/8 in OD by 3/4 in long. Sufficient 3/8 in OD tygon tubing. Sufficient surgical rubber tubing. 1 gallon distilled water. 2 lbs technical grade ammonium chloride. 1 gallon 27% ammonium hydroxide.9.5.2.2 Test Solution Preparation9.5.2.2.1 Two pounds of technical grade ammoniumchloride are dissolved in one gallon of distilled waterand stored in a glass jar. One-half gallon of this solutionshall be combined with one-half gallon of 27%ammonium hydroxide.9.5.3 Equipment Assembly  The equipment is to beassembled, as per Figure 1, in a suitable wood or metalframe so arranged that the aspirator bottle connected tothe burette can be raised and lowered, as required, totransfer the gas being analyzed to and from the centeraspirator bottle which is filled with copper coils. Thetwo leveling bottles should be filled half full of testingsolution and the buret and aspirator bottle, whichcontains the copper coils, should be completely filled.9.5.4 Operating Procedure9.5.4.1 Before analyzing the sample, perform a seriesof analyses using a source of oxygen of which thepurity has been previously determined. This procedureis necessary to age the test solution properly andeliminate any air bubbles which may become trapped inthe apparatus. Only after three consecutive analyseshave been run, indicating the known purity, should youproceed with testing. (See Note 8)NOTE 8: This procedure will be required only immediatelyafter changing the test solution or contaminating the apparatuswith air.9.5.4.2 Attach rubber tubing from the regulator of thecylinder being tested to the stopcock of the burette.Rotate the stopcock so as to draw the sample into thegas measuring burette. Collect a little more than 100mL (i.e., below the zero mark) in the burette, and thenrotate the stopcock so as to shut off the oxygen flowand remove the rubber tubing attached to the intake ofthe burette. If the gas sample in the burette is below thezero mark raise the leveling bottle #1 so that thewater level in the burette is exactly zero (see Figure2a).9.5.4.3 Rotate the stopcock to connect the aspiratorbottle #3 containing the copper coils, and transfer theoxygen into this aspirator bottle by raising the levelingbottle #1 (see Figure 2b). Invert bottle #3 containing the

&lt;!-- Page 25 --&gt;

SEMI C54-1103 © SEMI 20035 copper coils so that both the inlet stopper and the sidedoutlet are in a downward position and shake gently for1 to 2 minutes. Stand test bottle #3 on its base andlower the leveling bottle so as to withdraw any residualgases into the gas measuring burette (see Figure 2c).Transfer at least 25 to 30 mL of test solution from theleft-hand leveling bottle #2 into the right-hand levelingbottle #l, through the copper coil bottle #3, and the gasburette while, at the same time, gently rocking andtapping the center bottle (see Figure 2d). This willmove any bubbles that might cling to the copper coilinto the gas measuring burette.9.5.4.4 Turn the stopcock off and raise the levelingbottle #l so that its liquid level is the same as the liquidlevel inside the upper portion of the gas burette (seeFigure 2e). When the levels of the leveling bottle andthe gas burette are the same, read the gas puritymarkings on the burette at the liquid level at this point.9.5.5 Maintenance9.5.5.1 Copper coils should be added to the test bottleas required to keep the bottles completely full. The gasburette should be kept clean with a strong detergentsolution to eliminate drops of liquid that might hang upin the gas space and give incorrect purity readings. Noreadings should be taken when the space above theliquid level of the gas burette has any liquid dropshanging in it, as this will give an erroneous purityreading.9.5.5.2 The solution must be replaced occasionally as itbecomes exhausted. The necessity of replacement maybe determined when the color begins to turn green, andby the increased length of shaking time required to get aminimum acceptable purity from the oxygen in acylinder of known purity. Suspect an exhausted solutionif analysis of a cylinder of known purity does not readthe correct purity.9.5.6 Standardization9.5.6.1 The method of analysis stated above can beused as a primary standard, meaning cylinders analyzedby this method can be used as standards ofmeasurement on electronic analyzers used to measureoxygen.9.5.6.2 This method is specific to oxygen when carbondioxide is not present in the sample gas. When carbondioxide is one of the components of the sample gas, thecarbon dioxide must first be scrubbed from the sample. 10 Analytical Procedures for Grade 3.8Oxygen (See Notes 1 in 9.2.4.1 and 9)NOTE 9: All gases used in the analysis of the sample shouldcontain not more than 10% of the sample value of thecomponent of interest unless otherwise specified 10.1 Argon  This procedure is for the determinationof argon using a gas chromatograph with a thermalconductivity detector.10.1.1 Detection Limit  25 ppm.10.1.2 Instrument Parameters10.1.2.1 Column: 3.6 m (12 ft) by 3.2 mm (1/8 in)stainless steel tubing packed with molecular sieve 5A,60/80 mesh, washed to remove fines and activated at300C for 24 hours or equivalent.10.1.2.2 Carrier Flow: 45 mL/min helium.10.1.2.3 Sample Volume: 13 mL.10.1.2.4 Temperatures: Detector 40CColumn 50C 10.1.3 Calibration Standard  50150 ppm argon,balance helium.10.1.4 Operating Procedure (Refer to Figure 3.)10.1.4.1 With the valve in Position A, purge the sampleloop with the calibration standard.

They must be constructedfrom high cleanliness materials, such as electropolishedstainless steel. The sample line should be cleaned ifexposed to hydrocarbons, such as oils or greases.8.2.4.2 Draw a continuous liquid sample from thesource. The sample line should be insulated so that thesample does not boil due to heat infiltration. Thedistance between the sample point and the analyzershould be as small as possible to minimize boil-off.8.2.4.3 Heat the sample so that it is completelyvaporized, leaving absolutely no liquid or solid carbondioxide or water residue. Note that if detection ofheavy hydrocarbons (&gt;C10) is important, it may not befeasible to completely vaporize the sample. Therefore,a concentrator method, such as that described in ASTME 1747, Section 6, may be required.8.2.4.4 Maintain the sample temperature at theanalyzer inlet above its condensation point. A sampletemperature of 40 oC is recommended.8.2.4.5 Figure 1 illustrates one potential samplingconfiguration.8.2.5 Operating Procedure8.2.5.1 Follow the procedures specified in theinstrument manufacturers manual.8.2.5.2 Allow the system to run until a stable reading isobtained for 20 minutes. 8.2.5.3 Read and record the concentration ofhydrocarbons as methane indicated on the totalhydrocarbon analyzer, in ppmv. The result obtainedshall not exceed the value specified in Section 5 of thisspecification.8.3 Metals  This procedure is for the determinationof insoluble and soluble metals in carbon dioxide usinginductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), ICP-AES. Specific components to be monitoredare Na, Fe, Ni, Cu, Cr, Co, Mn, Ca, Mo and W.NOTE 2: The specified method does not detect volatilemetals.8.3.1 Detection Limit  Determined per SEMI C10.8.3.2 Instrument Parameters8.3.3 Calibration Standards  Consult withinstrument manufacturer instructions. All instrumentcalibration standards should be prepared from NIST-traceable reference standards.8.3.4 Sampling System8.3.4.1 Two sample preparation methods are approvedfor metals analysis. These are a residue method and afiltration method. The user may select between thesetechniques based on convenience, economicconsiderations, or other situation specific conditions.8.3.4.1.1 Residue Method  A CO 2 sample istransferred to an ambient pressure vessel and allowed tosublime. The remaining metal residue is dissolved innitric acid.8.3.4.1.1.1 The sample line and associated valves mustbe clean and metal particle free. They must beconstructed from high cleanliness materials, such aselectropolished stainless steel.8.3.4.1.1.2 The sample system must be purged withhigh-purity nitrogen prior to and after sampling. Priorto sampling, the entire sampling system should bepurged by allowing high purity nitrogen to flow throughthe system at 510 psig for a minimum of threeminutes.8.3.4.1.1.3 When the purge is complete, draw asufficient mass of liquid carbon dioxide sample fromthe source to obtain a meaningful metals level. A valveshould be installed in the sample line to flash the liquidsample from the operating pressure to near ambientpressure. This will cause the sample to form asolid/vapor mixture. This mixture should then bedirected to the bottom of a vented sample flask. Thesample flask should have a volume of 100 ml andshould be composed of polypropylene or other suitablematerials. It should be cleaned prior to use using DIwater.

When sampling is complete, theresulting solid CO 2 should be allowed to warm toambient temperature and sublime. As a result, vaporCO 2 will leave the sample flask.8.3.4.1.1.5 After all of the CO 2 has been vented fromthe sample flask, the system should be purged withnitrogen for 15 minutes.8.3.4.1.1.6 The sample flask should then be filled witha solution of 5% ultrapure HNO 3/DI H 2O. Thissolution may be spiked with an appropriate internalstandard. Allow the metal residue contained in theflask to dissolve in the solution for a minimum of onehour. Note that a different solution may be used,depending on possible interferences with a givenanalytical technique. The solution contained in sampleflask is ready for injection into an ICP-MS.8.3.4.1.1.7 Figure 2 illustrates a potential configurationfor this sampling system. FROMLIQUIDCO2SYSTEM NITROGENVENT SAMPLE FLASK Figure 2Potential Metals Sample Preparation System-Residue Method 8.3.4.1.2 Filtration Method  A Teflon ® filter is usedto remove metallic impurities from CO 2. The collectedmetallic impurities are dissolved in nitric acid.8.3.4.1.2.1 The sample line and associated valves mustbe clean and metal particle free. They must beconstructed from high cleanliness materials, such aselectropolished stainless steel.8.3.4.1.2.2 A sampling manifold, such as that depictedin Figure 3 may be employed. Referring to this figure,V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 are shut off valves, MV is ametering valve, PSV is a pressure relief device set to2000 psi and FH is a filter holder that accommodates a0.2 m Teflon® filter. A flow meter at the exit end ofthe sampling system is used to measure the sampleflow. A heating device such as a heat lamp is used,downstream of the filter to totally vaporize the liquidCO 2 so that an accurate flow measurement can bemade. 8.3.4.1.2.3 The sample system must be purged withhigh-purity nitrogen prior to sampling. Close valvesV1, V2, V3, V4 , V5 and MV. Open V2, V3, V4, V5and MV to establish a flow of nitrogen that is filtered toremove particles smaller than 0.2 micron. Allownitrogen to flow through the system for a minimum of 3minutes. Close V2, V3, V4, and V5.8.3.4.1.2.4 Clean a 0.2 m Teflon ® filter using a 10%by weight HNO 3 solution. Install the filter in the filterholder FH. Perform this operation in a Class 100laminar flow hood.8.3.4.1.2.5 Install the filter holder in the samplingsystem.8.3.4.1.2.6 Open V1 and V3. Allow CO 2 to flow untilliquid is observed at the flow meter.8.3.4.1.2.7 Turn on the heating device.8.3.4.1.2.8 Close V1, then simultaneously open V4 andV5 to avoid pressurizing the filter from either end.Slowly open V1. Close V3 to establish CO 2 flowthrough the filter. Accurately note the flow meterreading and the initial sampling time.8.3.4.1.2.9 Allow a sufficient volume of CO 2 to flowthrough the filter to collect a metals sample that willproduce a meaningful reading on the ICP-MS. Thisvolume will be a function of the metals level presentand must be estimated.8.3.4.1.2.10 Close V1 and V4, noting the final sampletime. Based on the flow meter reading and initial andfinal sample times, calculate the total amount of CO2sampled.8.3.4.1.2.11 Purge CO 2 from the sampling system byopening V2 and V3, allowing nitrogen to flow. Whenthe flow meter reading becomes very low or stops,close V4 and V5.8.3.4.1.2.12 Remove the filter holder from thesampling manifold and take it to a clean room fordisassembly. V2 should be opened to purge duringdisconnection.8.3.4.1.2.13 Disassemble the filter holder inside aClass 100 laminar flow hood. Remove the Teflon®filter, using Teflon ® tweezers. Put the filter in a PFAbottle containing a 10% by weight HNO3 solution.8.3.4.1.2.14 Place the PFA bottle containing the filterin an ultrasonic bath for 30 minutes. This will help todislodge any particles that are trapped on the filter andassist in their dissolution in the HNO3 solution. Thesolution contained in the PFA bottle is ready forinjection into an ICP-MS.
