6  Conventions
6. 1  Terms
6. 1.1  Class,  Data  Type,  Stereotype  Name  —  This  specification  uses  the  terms  “class”,  “data  type”,  “type”,  or  the
class stereotype name interchangeably to refer to a UML class.
6. 1.2  Consumer —  This  specification  uses  the  term  “consumer”  to  refer  to  any  software  entity  that  uses  the
DataCollectionManager interface to manage data collection on the equipment.
6. 1.3  Built-in  DCP  —  This  specification  uses  the  term  “built-in”  DCP  to  refer  to  pre-defined  DCPs  that  are
provided with the equipment.  Built-in DCPs can be activated by any consumer, but can not be changed or deleted
by any consumer.  See Section 11.1.2.1 for details.
6. 1.4  Reporting, Buffering, Sending — This specification uses the term “reporting” to refer to the act of collecting
event, exception, or trace data values to later be sent to a consumer.  The term “buffering” is used to refer to the act
of storing a data report on the equipment for some period of time before sending to a consumer.  The term “sending”
is used to refer to the act of sending a report to a consumer.
6. 2  Notation
6. 2.1  Unified Modeling Language Notation — All class and sequence diagrams in this specification make use of the
Unified Modeling Language notation.
6. 2.1.1  UML Stereotypes — This specification uses the following stereotypes in class diagrams:
• privilege — Classes with this stereotype identify an abstract privilege concept that grants permission to a
consumer to perform an activity or operation.
• interface  —  Classes  with  this  stereotype  define  a  collection  of  operations  and  their  semantics.    It  is  the
responsibility of the equipment and its consumers, where specified, to provide implementations of these classes.
• enumeration — Classes with this stereotype identify data types that have a finite set of discrete values that
can be assumed by instances of the class.
6. 2.2  UML Associations — The mechanism used for realizing UML associations between classes is implementation
dependent.  This document is abstract in nature, and does not specify or imply any such mechanism.  Any adjunct
standard that provides an implementation of this specification must include a description of the mechanism used for
representing the UML associations shown in this document.

Association Notation</p><ol start="6"><li>2.3  Association  Notation  —  This  document  uses  the  UML  aggregation  diamond  adornment,  role  names,  end
multiplicities,  and  navigability  in  all  class  diagrams  specifying  associations.    Unadorned  associations  are  not  used,
for economy of notation.  All role names are public by default, therefore the visibility symbols are not used.  See the
UML 1.4 specification, Section 3.43 for details.</li></ol><p>SEMI E134-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 5
6. 2.3.1  Open  diamond  adornments  indicate  that  instances  of  the  target  class  may  be  shared  among  aggregate
classes.  Closed diamond adornments indicate that target instances belong to at most one composite class.  The part-
whole  semantics  of  the  aggregation/composition  symbol  is  not  significant  in  this  specification.    See  the  UML  1.4
specification, Sections 3.43.2.5 and 3.48 for further information.
6. 2.3.2  Some diagrams use the UML “ordered” or “XOR” constraints where applicable.  An “ordered” constraint on
an  association  indicates  that  the  order  in  which  the  target  instances  appear  in  the  aggregation  is  semantically
significant, and is described in the supporting text of the diagram.  See the UML 1.4 specification, Section 3.43.2.2
for further information.
6. 2.3.3  An  “XOR”  constraint  indicates  that  only  one  of  many  possible  associations  can  be  instantiated  at  any  one
time  for  a  given  instance  of  the  association  class.    See  the  UML  1.4  specification,  Section  3.42.5.1  for  further
information.

7  Background</li><li>1  Equipment Data Collection</li><li>1.1  Manufacturing  equipment  can  be  comprised  of  hundreds  or  thousands  of  components  that  interoperate  in
order  for  the  equipment  to  perform  its  intended  function.    The  volume  of  information  that  such  equipment  can
produce, and the variation among equipment users in the data used for process control and other applications, makes
it impractical to send all equipment data off-tool all the time, or to agree on a fixed set of data to make available for
each equipment type.  It is therefore important for the equipment to support the ability for consumers to dynamically
define the data that is of interest to them (see Figure 2).</li></ol><p>Wafer Handling

Consumer Specifies What Data Should Be Sent Off-Tool</p><ol start="7"><li>1.2  In  addition  to  declaring  interest  in  specific  data  that  a  consumer  is  interested  in,  different  consumers  have
different  requirements  for  the  acceptable  latency  with  which  data  should  be  reported  off-tool.    For  example,  a
consumer  that  is  monitoring  a  trace  of  several  process  variables  in  order  to  detect  an  excursion  needs  to  have  this
data  available  off-tool  almost  as  quickly  as  the  equipment  can  produce  it  (see  Figure  3).    A  consumer  that  is
monitoring low-level sensor/actuator activity for later diagnosis prefers not to have all of this data transmitted as it is
produced, but buffered on the tool and transmitted at periodic intervals (see Figure 4).</li></ol><p>SEMI E134-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 7

styles of data collection, a method for managing groups of related data as a unit can make it easier for consumers to
define, enable, and disable the transmission of data.  An example of this organization is shown in Figure 5.</li></ol><p>SEMI E134-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 8</p><p>Parameter A

Data Collection Schemes with Different Objectives</p><ol start="7"><li>1.4  It  is  possible  for  consumers  to  submit  data  collection  requests  which,  when  executing  together,  significantly
tax  the  equipment’s  computing  resources.    When  the  equipment  detects  that  this  is  occurring,  it  should  be  able  to
provide  a  warning  to  consumers  that  a  performance  threshold  is  being  reached.    Consumers  can  respond  to  these
warnings by adjusting or disabling the active data collection requests.  In the worst case, if the equipment determines
that continuing to operate under degraded performance conditions may seriously jeopardize its ability to perform its
intended function, the equipment can terminate all data collection activity.</li><li>1.5  This specification describes the concepts and behaviors necessary to facilitate these capabilities on equipment.
8  Overview</li><li>1  Data Collection Concepts</li><li>1.1  This  specification  allows  consumers  to  describe  a  set  of  data  in  which  they  are  interested,  and  to  ask  the
equipment to send only that data off-tool, according to a buffering policy specified by the consumer.  The types of
data that are supported by this specification are described in the following sections.</li><li>2  Trace Data</li><li>2.1  Trace  data  allows  data  acquisition  consumers  to  request  the  collection  of  data  values  that  are  continuously
changing, or that change frequently such as pressure, temperature, RF power, magnetic field strength, or individual
actuator  state  changes,  etc.    This  document  defines  a  mechanism  for  specifying  when  trace  data  collection  begins
and ends, what the collection frequency is, and what variables are to be collected in the trace (see Section 11.1.5).</li><li>2.2  This specification defines a mechanism for specifying when to start tracing (see Section 11.1.5.6):
• On the occurrence of a specific event or exception from a set of possible events and exceptions
• As soon as enabled</li><li>2.3  This specification defines a mechanism for specifying when to stop tracing (see Section 11.1.5.7):
• On the occurrence of a specific event or exception from a set of possible events and exceptions
• After a specified number of collection results have been accumulated
• As soon as disabled</li><li>2.4  This specification defines a mechanism for identifying parameters to be included in trace data collection (see
Section  11.1.9).    Consumers  can  use  any  naming  convention  supported  by  the  equipment,  provided  that  such
conventions can support the concept of a parameter source and a parameter name represented as text fields.</li><li>2.5  This specification defines a mechanism to support on-tool buffering, allowing trace reports containing many
collection results to be sent off-tool at a regular interval (see Sections 11.1.2.3 and 11.1.5.3).</li><li>3  Events</li><li>3.1  Events  allow  data  acquisition  consumers  to  determine  when  a  subsystem,  process  job,  sensor/actuator,  or
other modeled system undergoes a state transition.  Events may have data variables associated with the occurrence</li></ol><p>SEMI E134-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 9
of the event.  Such variables can include process data such as pressures, temperatures, or voltages, or context data
such as job related data, recipe ID’s, equipment configuration or offset values.  Typical consumers need to be able to
specify which variables are to be provided with the event when it is communicated.
8. 3.2  This specification defines a mechanism for identifying events and parameters to be included in data collection.
Consumers can use any naming convention that is supported by the equipment, provided that such convention can
support the concept of event sources and event id’s, and parameter sources and parameter names, each represented
as text fields (see Sections 11.1.3 and 14.1.3).
8. 3.3  This  specification  defines  a  mechanism  to  support  on-tool  buffering  of  events,  allowing  a  periodic  report  of
any events that occurred during a specified interval to be sent off-tool (see Section 11.1.2.3).
8. 4  Exceptions
8. 4.1  Exceptions  allow  data  acquisition  consumers  to  know  when  errors,  warnings,  or  alarms  occur  on  the
equipment.  These may indicate conditions which affect processing, safety, or the proper operation of the equipment.
Exceptions may have data variables associated with the occurrence of the exception.  The list of these variables will
be fixed by the equipment implementation.
8. 4.2  This  specification  defines  a  mechanism  for  identifying  exceptions  to  be  included  in  data  collection.
Consumers can use any naming convention that is supported by the equipment, provided that such convention can
support the concept of exception sources and exception id’s, each represented as text fields (see Sections 11.1.4 and
14. 1.4).
8. 4.3  This specification defines a mechanism to support on-tool buffering of exceptions, allowing a periodic report
of any exceptions that occurred during a specified interval to be sent off-tool (see Section 11.1.2.3).
8. 5  Data Collection Plans
8. 5.1  A data collection plan assembles all of the related trace, event, and exception data that may be required for a
specific consumer’s purpose.  For example, a consumer interested in tracking the utilization of the equipment may
only  be  interested  in  specific  events  that  mark  actions  the  equipment  takes  that  indicate  how  it  is  being  exercised,
certain exceptions that may interrupt the equipment, and no trace data.  Such a data collection plan might be in effect
at all times the equipment is running.
8. 5.2  A fault detection consumer may be interested in trace, event, and exception data for a specific processing run,
and may change the collected data depending on the recipe used.  Such data collection plans may only be in effect
while specific jobs are in process on the equipment.  Coordination of data collection plan activation with job activity
on the equipment is the consumers’ responsibility, and is not specified in this document.
8. 5.3  This document specifies a mechanism for consumers to define one or more data collection plans off-tool and
submit those definitions to the equipment (see Sections 9.1.2.2 and 11).  This document specifies a mechanism for
determining  what  plans  have  been  created  on  the  equipment,  how  they  are  defined,  and  whether  or  not  they  are
activated  (see  Sections  9.1.2.3,  9.1.2.4,  and  9.1.2.6).    A  mechanism  for  activating,  deactivating,  and  deleting
individual  plans  is  also  specified  (see  Sections  9.1.2.5,  9.1.2.7,  and  9.1.2.8).    The  required  behavior  of  data
collection plans is specified in Section 12.
8. 6  Equipment Operational Performance Monitoring
8. 6.1  It  is  possible  for  consumers  to  submit  data  collection  requests  which,  when  executing  together,  significantly
tax  the  equipment’s  computing  resources,  in  addition  to  any  load  placed  on  the  equipment  by  jobs  that  are  in
progress.  This document specifies a mechanism for notifying all DCP consumers when such a condition has been
detected,  to  identify  what  DCPs  and  jobs  are  in  progress  at  the  time,  and  to  identify  the  specific  equipment
components that are being adversely affected (see Sections 9.1.2.11, 13, 15.1.5, and 15.1.6).
8. 7  Ad-hoc Data Requests
8. 7.1  Ad-hoc data requests are used in cases where the value of some data items is needed at a specific instance in
time,  and  which  may  not  be  associated  with  a  specific  event  or  exception.    As  a  simple  example,  consider  an
application  that  monitors  equipment  utilization.    Such  an  application  may  have  an  initialization  procedure  that
includes  determining  the  current  state  of  each  monitored  component  on  the  equipment.    Without  a  mechanism  for
requesting this information at initialization, the application would instead have to wait for state change events from
each  component  before  it  could  determine  their  state.    This  may  not  be  acceptable  if  the  application  provides  a</p><p>SEMI E134-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 10
visualization of the equipment to an end user who relies on the application to call attention to problem conditions on
the equipment.
8. 7.2  This document specifies a mechanism for consumers to issue ad-hoc requests for data in order to support these
uses, through the GetObjectInstanceIds and GetParameterValue operations of the DataCollectionManager interface
(see Sections 9.1.2.9 and 9.1.2.10).

interested  in  the  attributes  of  specific  E39  objects  can  only  make  requests  from  a  specific  object  instance  if  the
unique instance identification information for such objects is known.  This operation allows consumers to learn from
the equipment how many E39-compliant objects of a given ObjType are instantiated on the equipment at the time of
the request, and what their unique instance identification information is.  The consumer may then use that instance
information  to  request  E39-compliant  object  attribute  values  using  either  the  GetParameterValues  operation  (see
Section  9.1.2.9),  or  by  including  this  information  in  a  DCP.    E39-compliant  object  attribute  values  are  returned  as

11. 1.4.5  If  more  than  one  of  the  above  attributes  is  non-empty,  then  whether  or  not  an  exception  will  be  reported
will be determined by applying Boolean AND logic to the non-empty attributes.  At least one attribute must be non-
empty.
11. 1.4.6  It  is  not  possible  to  customize  the  parameters  to  be  sent  when  exceptions  occur.    Equipment  suppliers
define what parameters, if any, are sent with exceptions.
11. 1.4.7  ExceptionRequests may refer to exceptions whose state the equipment tracks (for example, the “alarm set”
and  “alarm  clear”  states  for  E30  alarms).    If  an  ExceptionRequest  in  a  DCP  refers  to  such  an  exception,  the
equipment shall send an ExceptionReport (see Section 14.1.4) each time there is a change in the exception’s state.
Different data may be reported for each different exception state. If an Exception does not have any associated state,
it is not necessary to report any description of the state of the exception (see Section 14.1.4.1.2).
11. 1.5  TraceRequest — This class identifies a set of parameters whose values are to be periodically collected and
reported to the consumer using the format defined in Section 14.1 .  The class is used to describe at what rate the set
of requested parameters should be collected, if/how collected trace data should be buffered on the tool and when the
results should be sent to the consumer, and when the trace should start and stop.

detected or until the total number of collection results obtained is equal to collectionCount, whichever occurs first.
For example, the consumer may wish to provide both a stop trigger and a non-zero collectionCount in order to limit
the total number of collection results to report regardless of whether or not the stop trigger occurs, or in case an error
condition on the equipment prevents the stop trigger from firing.</li><li>1.5.3  groupSize</li><li>1.5.3.1  Depending  on  the  buffering  capacity  of  the  equipment,  the  DCP  may  send  a  TraceReport  before

DataCollectionPlan State Model</p><ol start="12"><li>1.1  The  purpose  of  the  DataCollectionPlan  state  model  is  to  define  the  consumer’s  view  of  the  behavior  of  a
DCP, which includes the consumer’s interactions with the equipment necessary to define, activate, de-activate, and
delete  DCPs.    Each  DCP  on  the  equipment  shall  execute  independently,  as  described  in  these  state  models.    The
equipment  supplier  is  not  required  to  provide  a  direct,  literal  implementation  of  these  state  models.    They  are
documented  here  to  provide  a  precise  definition  of  the  required  behavior  for  DCPs  on  the  equipment.    The
transitions described in these state machines are not to be made available for event data collection.</li><li>1.1.1  Implementation mappings of this specification may identify additional conditions other than those defined
in this document under which DCP activity should be terminated (that is, cause a transition from the “Active” to the
“Inactive” state).  All such conditions, and the details of required equipment behavior under those conditions, shall
be fully specified in any implementation mapping for which this is a consideration.</li><li>1.2  DataCollectionPlan — The superstate for all DCP states. The equipment has validated the DCP and stored it
in non-volatile memory.  The DCP may now be activated and de-activated.</li><li>1.3  Inactive — The equipment is not sending or buffering any event, exception, or trace reports requested in the
DCP  to  any  consumer.    A  transition  to  Active  is  required  for  the  data  defined  in  this  DCP  to  be  reported  to  a
consumer.</li><li>1.4  Active — The equipment is sending and/or buffering all event, exception, and trace reports requested in the
DCP to all consumers that have successfully activated the DCP.  This state contains substates that are described in
Section.12.2 .</li><li>1.5  Hibernating  —  The  equipment  has  paused  the  sending  and  buffering  of  all  event,  exception,  and  trace
reports  requested  in  the  DCP,  because  the  equipment  is  entering  a  state  in  which  it  will  not  be  possible  to

available for event data collection.
12. 2.2  While  in  the  Active  state,  if  the  equipment  experiences  internal  communication  or  operational  failures  that
prevent  the  collection  of  event,  exception,  or  trace  data  requested  by  the  DCP,  the  equipment  shall  not  de-activate
the DCP.  If the values of any requested parameters can’t be obtained or refreshed as a result of such communication
failures, the equipment shall use the “NoValue” class (see Section 14.2.1.4) as the reported ParameterValue for all
such  affected  parameters.    The  equipment  is  not  required  to  take  any  other  actions  to  notify  consumers  of  such
failures.
12. 2.2.1  Consumers  should  be  aware  that  such  failures  may  temporarily  prevent  the  equipment  from  reporting
requested events or exceptions altogether, and/or result in reporting “NoValue” (see Section 14.2.1.4) for requested
parameters  affected  by  the  failure.    In  the  event  that  the  equipment  recovers  from  such  failures  and  any  affected
DCPs are still active, the equipment shall resume reporting all event, exception, and trace data whose reporting had
been affected by the failure.
12. 2.3  DCPBuffering — This is the top level state for describing the event, exception, and trace buffering behavior
of the DCP
12. 2.4  NotBuffering  —  The  DCP  is  immediately  sending  DataCollectionReports  for  each  requested  event  and
exception as they are detected.  TraceReports may be individually buffered, according to the ‘groupSize’ setting of
the  DCP’s  TraceRequests  (see  Section  11.1.5),  but  are  also  sent  in  the  DataCollectionReport  format  (see  Section
14. 1 ).  This state is only active if the DataCollectionPlan attribute ‘intervalInMinutes’ attribute is set to 0.
12. 2.5  Buffering  —  The  DCP  is  storing  all  events,  exceptions,  and  trace  data  in  an  internal  buffer  in  the  order  in
which   they   occur.      Buffered   data   is   sent   in   a   single   DataCollectionReport   (see   Section   14.1)   when
‘intervalInMinutes’  expires,  or  when  the  equipment’s  DCP  buffering  capacity  has  been  reached,  whichever  occurs
first.    The  equipment  continues  buffering  new  data  for  the  next  interval,  sending  a  single  DataCollectionReport
when ‘intervalInMinutes’ expires.  Each DataCollectionReport sent at the end of each interval contains only the data
collected  during  that  interval.    The  equipment  continues  this  buffering/sending  cycle  as  long  as  the  DCP  is  active.
This state is only active if the DataCollectionPlan attribute ‘intervalInMinutes’ attribute is &gt; 0.
12. 2.6  NotSending — The DCP is waiting for a DataCollectionReport to become ready for sending to the consumer
who activated the plan.
12. 2.7  Sending — The DCP is sending a DataCollectionReport to the consumer that activated this DCP (see Section
14. 1).
12. 2.8  MonitoringEventRequests —  The  DCP  is  actively  tracking  and  reporting  any  event  requests  provided  with
the DCP.  This is the top level state for the WaitingForEvent state.
12. 2.9  WaitingForEvent  —  The  DCP  is  waiting  for  the  occurrence  of  any  of  the  requested  events  defined  in  the
DCP.
12. 2.10  MonitoringExceptionRequests  —  The  DCP  is  actively  tracking  and  reporting  any  exception  requests
provided with the DCP.  This is the top level state for the WaitingForException state.

trace  request  provided  with  the  DCP.    Either  the  occurrence  of  a  start  trigger  defined  for  the  trace  request  was
detected, or there was no defined start trigger and the DCP began tracing immediately after activation.  If the DCP
entered this state due to the detection of a start trigger, it shall record the specific trigger that was detected and the
time at which it was detected for inclusion in a trace report (see Section 14.1.5).
12. 3.6  Waiting  forInterval  —  The  DCP  is  waiting  for  a  time  period  equal  to  the  TraceRequest  attribute
‘intervalInSeconds’ (see Section 11.1.5) to expire before collecting the data associated with the trace request.
12. 3.7  TraceRequestBuffering  —  This  is  the  top  level  state  for  trace  request  buffering  activity.    Buffered  trace
requests  store  the  results  of  each  trace  interval  as  a  CollectedData  entry  within  a  single  TraceReport  (see  Section
14. 1.5).  Each CollectedData entry appears within the TraceReport in the order the collection results were obtained.
12. 3.7.1  When a stop trigger is detected, or the total number of results collected since the trace was enabled is equal
to ‘collectionCount’, or the number of results collected since the last send is equal to ‘groupSize’, or the DCP’s trace
buffering  capacity  has  been  reached,  the  DCP  creates  a  single  DataCollectionReport  and  makes  it  available  for
sending.  The DataCollectionReport contains a single TraceReport that contains two or more CollectedData entries,
in the order in which the results were obtained (see Section 14.1.5).
12. 3.8  NotBufferingTraceResults  —  The  trace  request  is  not  buffering  collected  results  into  a  single  TraceReport,
because  ‘groupSize’  is  ≤  1.    Each  collected  result  is  added  to  a  new  TraceReport  and  either  made  available  for
sending with a DataCollectionReport, or added to the DCP buffer in the order the TraceReport was completed.
12. 3.9  BufferingTraceResults — The trace request is buffering collected results into a single TraceReport because
‘groupSize’ is &gt; 1.  Each new result is appended to the TraceReport as CollectedData (see Section 14.1.5.2).

operation  of  the  DataCollectionManager  interface,  and  for  the  PerformanceWarning  and  PerformanceRestored
notifications sent via the DCPConsumer interface (see Section 15.1.5).
13. 1.3  The  equipment  shall  include  the  following  minimum  set  of  conditions  in  determining  the  performance
conditions to monitor:
• Impairment of the equipment’s ability to properly control its components for their intended purpose.
• Impairment of the equipment’s ability to process/measure/test material at its intended throughput rates.
• Impairment of the equipment’s ability to deliver data from active DCPs to consumers.
13. 1.4  If  at  any  time  the  equipment  determines  that  continuing  to  operate  under  degraded  performance  conditions
will  endanger  people,  the  equipment  (including  its  ability  to  sustain  the  transmission  of  data,  or  the  processing  of
data  collection  management  operations),  or  the  material  being  processed,  measured,  or  tested,  the  equipment  shall
terminate  all  active  DCPs,  and  notify  each  client  accordingly,  using  the  DCPDeactivation  message  (see  Section
15. 1.6.2).
13. 1.5  Note that this specification does not define a mechanism for establishing operational performance thresholds,
or any technique for detecting when an equipment system’s operational performance is degrading.  It is assumed that
equipment performance can be quantified, that it is possible to detect when such performance degrades below some
supplier-defined threshold, and that it is possible to identify which components of the equipment are affected by the
issue.
13. 1.6  Normal — The equipment is operating within supplier-specified performance parameters.
13. 1.7  BelowThreshold — One or more components of the equipment system is operating below supplier-specified
performance parameters.</p><p>SEMI E134-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 45</p><p>Operat ion alPerf ormance Conditions

14. 1.1  Figure  24  shows  how  to  represent  a  DataCollectionReport  containing  the  data  associated  with  a  specific
DCP.  These formats are used to send data to consumers using the interface defined in Section 15.  The equipment is
not required to retain these reports for re-transmission once they have been sent to a consumer.
14. 1.1.1  DataCollectionReport —  this  class  represents  one  or  more  collected  data  items.    A  data  collection  report
contains   one   or   more   Reports,   which   can   be   an   ExceptionReport,   EventReport,   or   TraceReport.      If   the
DataCollectionReport  contains  more  than  one  of  those  items,  they  are  ordered  according  to  the  time  of  their
occurrence (‘reportTime’, in the case of TraceReports).  A DataCollectionReport for a given DCP shall not contain
more than one Report if the ‘intervalInMinutes’ field of the corresponding DCP was set to 0.

14. 1.5.1.1  More than one result is included in a trace report if and only if the DCP has specified that the equipment
should buffer collected data for the trace before reporting (that is, the ‘groupSize’ attribute of the TraceRequest class
is &gt; 1).
14. 1.5.1.2  If  the  trace  request  included  start-  and/or  stop-triggers,  the  TraceReport  includes  the  trigger  that
started/stopped the trace, and the time at which the trigger was detected.  These are only required to be provided in
