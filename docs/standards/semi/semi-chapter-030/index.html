12. 4.3      Modifying     Process     Program     V ariable
Parameters —  The  remote  commands  of  PP-SELECT,
PP-ASSIGN,  or  PP-UPDATE  are  used  to  modify  any
of  the  identified  process  program  variable  parameters
within  the  process  program.  The  modification  is  done
by   including   CPNAME/CPVAL   pairs   within   the
“PROCESS-BLD-GROUP”,   which   is   part   of   the
remote  commands  of  PP-SELECT  or  PP-ASSIGN,  or
by  including  a  different  list  name  in  the  PP-UPDATE
remote  command.  A  CPNAME  in  a  process  program
shall   be   identical   to   the   process   program   variable
parameter  name  as  specified  in  the  “PROCESS-BLD-
GROUP”.   See   next   section   for   details   of   these
parameters.
12. 5   Use  of  Process  Programs,  Rem ote  Commands,
and   “PROCESS-BLD-GROUP”   —   This   is   a   brief
description  of  the  steps  involved  in  using  the  process
program    structure,    the    process    program    variable
parameters, the TABLE-DEFs, and the modification of
process program variable parameters through the use of
“PROCESS-BLD-GROUP”   and   CPNAME/CEPVAL
pairs in the enhanced remote command (S2,F49).
• A process program is created with certain items in
the  body  identified  as  process  program  variable
parameters, along with their default values.
• The host sends to equipment one or more TABLE-
DEFs:     such     as     “TABLE-AREA-DEF”     and
“TABLE-ALIGN-DEF”,  along  with  the  names  of
those tables using Stream 13 commands (See SEMI
E5).   These   tables   are   now   resident   on   the
equipment.
• The   host   sends   an   enhanced   remote   command
(S2,F49)  to  the  equipment  (either  PP-SELECT  or
PP-ASSIGN)  that  contains  the  information  needed
for       processing       (“CARRIERBLD”).       The
“CARRIERBLD”   contains   a   “PROCESS-BLD-
GROUP”  for  each  different  set  of  run  parameters
that  are  needed  during  the  inspection  or  review
process.
• “PROCESS-BLD-GROUP”     shall     contain     the
ProcessBuildGroupID to identify which program is
selected.
• If  the  default  list  of  slots  in  the  process  program
needs to be changed for this run, then “PROCESS-
BLD-GROUP” contains a “MATERIALLIST” and
the list of selected slots or substrates, designated by
SlotIDs or SubstrateIDs.
• If the default set of inspection areas in the process
program  needs  to  be  changed  for  this  run,  then
“PROCESS-BLD-GROUP” contains the name of a
specific    “TABLE-AREA-DEF”    (in    AreaTable
Name).  If  not  all  of  the  inspection  areas  given  in
that “TABLE-AREA-DEF” are needed for this run,
then “AREALIST” is used and includes a list of the
names  of  the  specific  inspection  areas  which  are
needed.   Those   names   refer   to   inspection   areas
defined in the “TABLE-AREA-DEF”.
• If  the  default  set  of  alignment  sites  in  the  process
program  needs  to  be  changed  for  this  run,  then
“PROCESS-BLD-GROUP” contains the name of a
specific   “TABLE-ALIGN-DEF”   (in   AlignTable
Name).  If  not  all  of  the  alignment  sites  given  in
that  “TABLE-ALIGN-DEF”  are  needed  for  this
run, then “ALIGNLIST” is used and includes a list
of  the  names  of  the  specific  alignment  sites  which
are  needed.  Those  names  refer  to  alignment  sites
defined in the “TABLE-ALIGN-DEF”.
• If  the  SEMI  M21  coordinate  system  is  being  used
and a pattern has been defined with pattern element
names and if only certain of those elements need to
be  inspected  for  this  run,  then  “PROCESS-BLD-
GROUP”  contains  an  “ELEMENTLIST”  and  the
list     of     selected     elements,     designated     by
ElementIDs.
• If   certain   equipment-specific   process   program
variable  parameters  need  to  have  different  values
for   this   run,   then   for   each   needed   parameter,
“PROCESS-BLD-GROUP”  contains  a  CPNAME
(unique   name   of   a   specific   process   program
variable  parameter)  and  the  new  CEPVAL  (new
value for that parameter).
• The  equipment  executes  the  process  program  with
the new values.
• If  indicated  in  the  process  program,  the  equipment
generates the list of anomalies found and sends it to
the  host  in  the  format  of  a  “TABLE-ANOMALY-
DEF”  using  the  ISEM  table  definition  and  Stream
13  transfer  messages  (see  SEMI  E5  for  format
specification).
• The  host  would  send  the  “TABLE-ANOMALY-
DEF” to a review equipment. The host might need
to modify part of the table if required by the review
equipment.  This  anomaly  table  is  now  resident  on
the  review  equipment.  (NOTE:  The  host  might
choose to not send all of the table of anomalies, but
rather a desired selection of them.)
• The host sends the equipment the enhanced remote
command    (PP-SELECT    or    PP-ASSIGN)    that
contains           a           “CARRIERBLD”.           The
“CARRIERBLD”      has      a      “PROCESS-BLD-
GROUP”  for  each  different  set  of  run  parameters
that  is  needed  by  the  review  equipment.  It  is
required  for  the  host  to  use  the  Enhanced  Remote
Command  S2,F49  for  transferring  the  information</p><p>SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 200027
to    the    equipment.    “PROCESS-BLD-GROUP”
includes    the    name    of    a    specific    “TABLE-
ANOMALY-DEF”         in         the         parameter
AnomalyTableName.  If  not  all  of  the  anomalies
given   in   that   “TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF”   are
needed for this run, then either “ANOMALYLIST”
or “M21-ANOMALYLIST” is used and includes a
list  of  the  names  of  the  specific  anomalies  which
are   desired.   Those   names   refer   to   anomalies
defined in the named “TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF”.
• The equipment runs the process program using the
selected    values    and    reviewing    the    specific
anomalies indicated.
• The  equipment  adds  review  information  to  the
ANOMALYATTRIBUTE   list.   Then   the   review
equipment     sends     this     modified     “TABLE-
ANOMALY-DEF” to the host.
13  Remote Commands
The   purpose   of   this   section   is   to   identify   remote
commands, command parameters, and valid commands
versus states pertinent to the SEM.
13. 1  Requirements
• The   equipment   shall   support   the   SEMI   E30
required remote commands.
• All  the  remote  commands  defined  by  ISEM  are
required  unless  they  have  been  qualified  by  the
statement    “if    the    equipment    supports    this
functionality,  it  shall  use  this  command.”  In  this
case,   they   are   only   required   if   the   equipment
supports  the  functionality  necessary  to  support  the
command.  A  good  example  of  this  is  the  MAP-
CARRIER  command.  If  the  equipment  does  not
have  the  hardware  necessary  to  scan  a  carrier  for
the   presence   of   substrates   in   slots,   then   the
command is not required by the ISEM.
• The  alphanumeric  strings  defined  by  ISEM  for
RCMD and CPNAME are required.
Host  Command  Parameter  (CPNAME/CPVAL)  —  A
parameter  name/value  associated  with  a  particular  host
command  when  using  stream  function  (S2,F41)  and  a
(CPNAME/CEPVAL)    parameter    name/value    when
using  the  enhanced  remote  command  (S2,F49).  This
document  specifies  unique  names  (CPNAMEs)  and
values  (CPVALs  and  CEPVALs)  for  many  command
parameters.   Note   that   if   there   are   no   associated
parameters, a zero length list is sent.
The  purpose  of  the  remote  commands  is  to  allow  host
control over the following capabilities:
• Start processing
• Stop processing
• Temporarily suspend processing
• Resume processing
• Abort processing
• Select  process  programs,  material,  and/or  sites  to
measure
• Report location of material found
The  following  remote  commands  (RCMDs)  shall  be
supported as described below:
NOTE  3:  The  terms  “current  cycle”  and  “safe  point”  used
below are to be defined by the supplier.
13. 2  Remote Commands Descriptio n</p><ol><li>ABORT  —  Terminate  the  current  cycle  prior  to  its
completion. ABORT has the intent of immediately
stopping   the   process   and   is   used   because   of
abnormal  conditions.  ABORT  makes  no  guarantee
about  the  subsequent  condition  of  material  except
as noted in the “ABORTLEVEL” description.</li><li>CLEANUP  —  De-selection  of  the  current  ISEM
job    (“CARRIERBLD”)    and    process    program
(“PROCESS-BLD-GROUP”),       including       the
removal of all material to output locations and any
equipment-specific  activities  needed  to  transition
into  the  IDLE  state.  Completion  of  this  command
should  generate  a  collection  event  report.  If  the
equipment  supports  this  functionality,  it  will  use
this command.</li><li>MAP-CARRIER   —   Requests   the   equipment   to
provide  a  list  of  carrier  slots  that  contain  material.
MAP-CARRIER  has  the  intent  of  providing  the
host  with  enough  information  about  the  location
and/or  ID  of  material  so  it  may  select  material  for
processing    accordingly.    Completion    of    this
command  shall  generate  a  collection  event  report.
If the equipment supports this functionality, it must
use this command.</li><li>NEXT-MATERIAL  —  Processing  of  the  current
substrate   is   halted   at   the   first   safe   point   and
unloaded  to  the  target  carrier  location.  NEXT-
MATERIAL  has  the  intent  of  allowing  the  host  to
skip measurement of the current substrate. This is a
trigger    for    processing    state    transition    from
WORKING    to    UNLOAD.    If    the    equipment
supports    this    functionality,    it    will    use    this
command.</li><li>PAUSE  —  Suspend  processing  temporarily  at  the
next  safe  point.  PAUSE  has  the  intent  of  resuming
the process at the same point where it was paused.</li></ol><p>SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 200028
RESUME or PP-UPDATE may be used to resume
the process.
6. PP-ASSIGN    —    Instructs    the    equipment    that
supports   queuing   to   create   a   new   ISEM   job
(“CARRIERBLD”)     for     the     specified     port
(“LOCATIONID”)  when  more  than  one  port  is
available   for   processing.   If   only   one   port   is
available,    “LOCATIONID”    is    not    required.
Priority   may   optionally   be   specified   with   this
command.  The  “PRIORITY”  specifies  the  priority
of the newly created job in the ISEM job queue (a
value of 0 (zero) assigns the highest priority to the
job).   Without   specifying   a   priority,   the   job   is
queued  with  the  default  priority.  Jobs  with  equal
priority  are  queued  in  the  order  the  PP-ASSIGN
commands  are  received.  This  command  is  valid  in
all PROCESSING states.
7. PP-SELECT  —  Instructs  the  equipment  to  make
the   requested   ISEM   job(s)   (“CARRIERBLD”)
available in the execution area. This is a trigger for
the   processing   state   transition   from   IDLE   to
SETTING    UP.    The    first    process    program
(“PROCESS-BLD-GROUP”)    specified    in    the
“CARRIERBLD”     is     also     validated     during
SETTING UP.
8. PP-UNASSIGN    —    Removes    the    ISEM    job
assignment   (“CARRIERBLD”)   for   a   carrier   or
port.  The  carrier  or  port  is  removed  from  the
process queue.
9. PP-UPDATE  —  Provides  the  ability  to  alter  the
current process program being executed during the
PAUSED   state.   The   process   program   variables
specified   in   the   PP-UPDATE   command   will
replace  previous  definitions  in  the  “PROCESS-
BLD-GROUP”.    This    command    will    trigger
transition   to   CHECKING   for   process   program
parameter  verification.  A  RESUME  command  is
implied with the validation of “all” replaced values
to resume the process. If the PP-UPDATE fails, the
process  program  variables  present  prior  to  the  PP-
UPDATE are retained. If no parameters values are
specified, the defaults are used.
10. RESUME  —  Resume  processing  from  the  point
where  the  process  was  paused.  This  is  the  trigger
for   processing   state   transition   from   PROCESS
PAUSE to the previous PROCESS state.
11. START   —   Instructs   the   equipment   to   initiate
processing.  This  is  the  trigger  for  the  processing
state   transition   from   READY   to   LOAD.   An
“AUTOSTART”   command   parameter   may   be
included to allow for continuous processing.
12. STOP — Complete the current cycle, stop in a safe
condition, and return to the IDLE processing state.
Stop has the intent of stopping the process entirely.
This command can be used to both: stop the current
ISEM   job   or   to   stop   all   queued   jobs.   The
equipment    is    not    required    to    support    the
continuation of processing.
13. 2.1 Remote    Commands    and    Associ ated    Host
Command   Parameters   —   This   table   describes   the
allowable  command  parameters  (CPNAME)  for  each
remote command (RCMD). Equipment shall support all
parameters.   The   column   marked   Req/Opt   specifies
which  parameters  are  required  to  be  sent  by  the  host
and  which  parameters  may  be  optionally  sent  by  the
host.

RELATED INFORMATION 1
NOTE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of
SEMI  E30.1  and  was  approved  for  publication  by  full  letter
ballot procedures on September 3, 1999.
R1-1  Defect Classification Code Management
The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  provide  a  method  and
specific  formats  to  define,  identify,  and  communicate
coordinate  systems  and  site  locations  on  substrates  for
alignment sites, anomaly locations, and other sites used
by the ISEM equipment.
R1-1.1    Classification  Codes  and  Defect  Classification
— One   function   of   review   equipment   is   to   view
previously   identified   anomalies   and   to   associate   a
defect   classification   code   with   each   anomaly.   A
classification  code  is  an  identifier  for  a  classification
description.
Typically,  the  review  equipment  has  a  set  of  defect
classification  codes  and  their  descriptions  available  to
the  operator.  Then,  for  each  anomaly,  the  operator
selects  a  particular  code  to  be  associated  with  that
anomaly. This action is defect classification.
The    set    of    valid    classification    codes    and    their
descriptions  may  change  from  one  run  to  another.  For
example, the same main process program could be used
with different substrate levels, and each level may use a
different set of classification codes. The purpose of this
section is to provide the requirements so that a user can
both define several sets of classification codes and their
descriptions  and  can  also  manage  these  sets  on  ISEM
equipment.
R1-1.2  Requirements
• Each    set    of    classification    codes    and    their
descriptions  shall  have  an  identifier,  known  as  a
classification code set ID.
• Review  equipment  shall  provide  a  means  for  the
user   (the   host   or   the   operator)   to   define   a
classification   code   set,   consisting   of   (a)   the
classification   code   set   ID   and   (b)   the   list   of
classification codes and their descriptions.
• Equipment  shall  provide  a  means  to  manage  the
various classification code sets.
• A  main  process  program  shall  include  a  process
program   variable   that   specifies   the   particular
classification code set ID to be used.
• Equipment  vendor  shall  provide  documentation  to
the   user   regarding   how   to   define   and   manage
classification code sets.
Comment:   In   one   implementation,   the   equipment
considers  a  classification  code  set  to  be  a  sub-process
program or an ISEM table. This would allow the user to
identify  a  classification  code  set  by  name  (using  a
PPID)  or  a  table  name  and  thereby  managing  this  sub-
process  program  with  the  SEMI  E30  Process  Program
Capability or with SEMI E58 ARAMS tables.
R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate
Systems
The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  provide  a  method  and
specific  formats  to  define,  identify,  and  communicate
coordinate  systems  and  site  locations  on  substrates  for
alignment sites, anomaly locations, and other sites used
by ISEM equipment.
The  ISEM-required  formats  are  intended  to  minimize
the    number    and    type    of    site    location    format
transformations   needing   to   be   supported   by   both
equipment suppliers and users.
All ISEM-required site location formats involve the use
of  an  ISEM-defined  right-handed  Cartesian  coordinate
system,  established  on  substrates  in  an  ISEM-defined
manner.  The  scope  of  the  detailed  methods  in  this
section are specific to unpatterned and patterned wafers
in this release, but the section is intended to be general
enough  in  methodology  so  that  it  can  be  extended  to
other  substrate  types  in  future  revisions  of  ISEM,  if
required.
The  purpose  of  inspection  and  review  equipment  is  to
locate,   evaluate,   classify,   and   report   anomalies   on
substrates.   ISEM   equipment   may   deal   with   either
unpatterned  or  patterned  substrates  or  both.  In  most
cases,  the  anomaly  location  is  part  of  the  information
reported and/or used by ISEM equipment. An anomaly
location   is   reported   at   a   particular   site   with   x,y
coordinates   in   a   particular   coordinate   system.   Site
coordinates  are  also  used  by  ISEM  equipment  for  the
alignment  sites  for  defining  a  coordinate  system  on  a
substrate.  A  standard  method  is  needed  to  define  a
coordinate  system  and  to  report  site  coordinates  for
both  alignment  sites,  anomaly  locations,  and  any  other
reference sites needed by ISEM equipment. A standard
method is essential in order to transfer the anomaly site
information from one equipment to another.
R1-2.1  Site Location Accuracy —  Each equipment has
an accuracy with which it can define or locate a site as
being within a certain area. This area associated with a
site is determined by the equipment accuracy, based on
the  accuracy  of  its  motion  and  imaging  systems  to
locate  a  site,  as  well  as  on  the  accuracy  with  which  it
can  define  the  coordinate  system  on  the  substrate.</p><p>SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 200040
When  equipment  shall  locate  a  particular  site  on  a
substrate   based   on   the   expected   or   design-based
location,  then  the  location  of  a  site  or  feature  on  an
actual  substrate  is  further  affected  by  the  accuracy  of
the   equipment   which   placed   the   pattern   on   the
substrate.
R1-2.2    Expected  or  Designed  Locations  vs.  Actual
Locations  —  The  placement  of  patterns,  sites,  and
coordinate   systems   is   designed   to   be   at   certain
mathematically   described   locations   relative   to   one
another   and   to   an   ideal   substrate.   These   are   the
expected   or   designed   locations.   When   a   pattern   is
written  by  equipment  onto  a  specific  substrate,  the
actual  placement  of  the  pattern,  the  pattern-elements,
and   their   features   may   differ   from   the   expected
locations,  due  to  variations  in  equipment  performance
and variations in substrate shape and dimensions.
R1-2.3  Substrate Coordinate Systems (Unpatterned) —
A  substrate  coordinate  system  is  a  coordinate  system
which  has  both  origin  and  axes  defined  by  the  shape
and  dimensions  of  the  substrate  and  which  does  not
depend on whether there is a pattern on the substrate or
whether  it  is  unpatterned.  This  coordinate  system  is
used to locate or define sites relative to the substrate.
R1-2.4    Substrate  Pattern  Coordinate  System  —  A
substrate   pattern   coordinate   system   is   a   coordinate
system  which  has  its  origin  and  axes  defined  by  the
pattern  as  a  whole  on  the  substrate.  This  coordinate
system is used to locate or to define sites relative to the
pattern  on  the  substrate.  The  expected  or  designed
location of the pattern on the substrate can be defined in
terms  of  the  placement  of  the  origin  and  axes  of  the
substrate  pattern  coordinate  system  relative  to  those  of
the substrate coordinate system. The actual location of a
pattern  on  a  substrate  may  differ  from  the  expected
location.  The  actual  location  is  determined  by  locating
two or more alignment sites on the patterned substrate.
The   alignment   sites   are   specific   points   of   certain
features in the pattern. The coordinates of the alignment
sites   are   given   in   the   substrate   pattern   coordinate
system. In many cases, equipment does not align to the
specific  pattern  elements  but  instead  uses  the  defined
locations  of  the  pattern  elements  within  the  substrate
pattern coordinate system.
R1-2.5      Pattern   Element   Coordinate   System   —   A
pattern-element   coordinate   system   is   a   coordinate
system  which  has  its  origin  and  axes  defined  by  the
pattern  of  one  specific  rectangular  element  in  a  pattern
(a   defined   arrangement)   of   equal-sized   rectangular
elements. This coordinate system is used to locate or to
define sites relative to that specific pattern-element. The
expected  or  designed  location  of  the  pattern-element
within   a   pattern   can   be   defined   in   terms   of   the
placement of the origin and axes of the pattern-element
coordinate   system   relative   to   those   of   the   pattern
coordinate  system.  The  actual  location  of  a  pattern-
element within a pattern on a substrate may differ from
the expected location. The actual location is determined
by  locating  two  or  more  alignment  sites  within  the
pattern-element.  The  coordinates  of  the  alignment  sites
are given in the pattern-element coordinate system.
R1-2.6    Parallel  Coordinate  Systems  —  A  second
coordinate system is considered to be parallel to a first
coordinate  system  if  the  origin  of  the  second  can  be
defined  as  a  translation  from  the  origin  of  the  first  and
if  the  axes  of  the  second  are  parallel  and  in  the  same
direction as those of the first.
R1-2.7    Requirements  —  The  following  is  a  list  of
requirements for ISEM equipment regarding coordinate
systems and reporting site locations:
• ISEM  equipment  shall  document  whether  it  deals
with  coordinate  systems  based  on  (a)  a  substrate,
(b)  a  substrate  pattern,  or  (c)  a  pattern-element  or
whether  it  deals  with  several  of  these  coordinate
systems.
• ISEM    equipment    shall    establish    a    substrate
coordinate  system  using  a  standard,  documented
method. This coordinate system is not based on any
pattern  on  the  substrate.  This  coordinate  system
shall  be  a  right-hand  Cartesian  coordinate  system
and shall be identified by a name.
NOTE: For wafers, this method is defined in SEMI M20
(Specification   for   Establishing   a   Wafer   Coordinate
System), and the coordinate system is named “M20.”
• For   equipment   dealing   with   substrate   pattern
coordinates, the substrate pattern coordinate system
shall  be  established  in  a  standard,  documented
method  relative  to  the  substrate  coordinate  system
(the    “unpatterned”    coordinate    system).    This
substrate pattern coordinate system shall be a right-
hand  Cartesian  coordinate  system  and  shall  be
designed  to  be  parallel  to  the  substrate  coordinate
system.  The  substrate  pattern  coordinate  system
shall  be  identified  by  a  name.  The  location  of  its
origin  and  axes  relative  to  the  substrate  coordinate
system  shall  be  communicated  in  terms  of  the
substrate coordinate system.
NOTE:  For  wafers,  this  method  is  the  one  described
below,  and  the  substrate  pattern  coordinate  system  is
named  “M20P”,  and  its  origin  and  axis  relative  to  the
SEMI  M20  coordinate  system  are  given  in  terms  of
“M20”    coordinates    and    are    communicated    using
XlateData.

method   relative   either   to   the   substrate   pattern
coordinate  system  or  to  another  pattern-element
coordinate  system.  The  pattern-element  coordinate
system  shall  be  a  right-hand  Cartesian  coordinate
system  which  is  designed  to  be  parallel  to  the
substrate  pattern  coordinate  system.  The  pattern-
element  coordinate  system  shall  be  identified  by  a
name. The location of its origin and axis relative to
the  substrate  pattern  coordinate  system  shall  be
communicated  in  terms  of  the  substrate  pattern
coordinate system.
NOTE: For wafers, this method is based on SEMI M21,
and the coordinate system is named “M21” and its origin
and  axis  relative  to  the  “M20P”  coordinate  system  are
given in terms of the M20P coordinates.
• ISEM  requires  that  equipment  have  the  capability
to use site location information that is based on the
user’s   product   designs,   which   the   user   shall
provide in the appropriate ISEM-required format.
• ISEM-compliant     equipment     shall     have     the
capability    to    define,    locate,    and    report    site
information  using  only  the  ISEM-defined  right-
handed  Cartesian  coordinate  system  formats.  This
requirement   does   not   preclude   equipment   from
having    additional    capability    for    defining    or
reporting   site   location   information   using   other
formats.
• Coordinate  system  name  and  placement  relative  to
the “higher” coordinate system shall be defined and
communicated   using   the   following   ISEM   data
items,   in   terms   of   either   expected   or   actual
placement:     CoordSys,     XlateData,     and     their
included data items.
• Alignment  site  information  shall  be  defined  and
communicated  using  the  following  ISEM  items:
the variable item AlignList, the “ALIGNLIST”, the
Process  program  class  of  “TABLE-ALIGN-DEF”,
and their included information.
• Areas  to  be  inspected  shall  be  reported  using  the
specific coordinate system defined by the user. The
following   ISEM   items   are   used   to   define   and
communicate   area   locations:   the   variable   item
“AREALIST”,  the  “AREALIST”,  and  the  Process
program  class  of  “TABLE-AREA-DEF”,  and  their
included information.
• The  displacement  of  an  actual  coordinate  system
relative    to    its    expected    location    shall    be
communicated    using    the    ISEM    data    item:
XlateData and its included data items.
• The displacement of an actual site location relative
to its expected site location shall be communicated
using  the  ISEM  data  item:  Offset  and  its  included
data items.
• The    equipment    vendor    shall    document    the
requirements  for  the  ISEM  data  items  used  in
alignment of a coordinate system.
• The equipment vendor shall provide and document
a  means  for  the  user  to  define  and  communicate  a
pattern map using SEMI M21 data. A pattern map
defines   the   layout   of   equal-sized   rectangular
pattern-elements  which  make  up  a  pattern.  Each
pattern-element shall have a name, using the SEMI
M21 naming convention.
NOTE:  For  patterned  wafers,  the  naming  method  shall
be that described in SEMI M21, and the pattern-element
information shall be communicated using the ISEM data
item of SEMI M21Data.
• For  ISEM  compliance,  inspection  equipment  shall
report     various     anomaly     data;     AnomalyID,
coordinates, and attributes. Review equipment shall
receive this data for anomalies and be able to locate
them    and    perhaps    modify    the    coordinates.
Anomaly coordinates shall be reported using ISEM
table  named  “TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF”  and  its
included data.
R1-3  Coordinate System for a Substrate
R1-3.1    SEMI  M20  Coordinate  System  —  The  SEMI
M20  standard  (Specification  for  Establishing  a  Wafer
Coordinate  System)  describes  how  to  map  a  right-
handed  Cartesian  coordinate  system  to  a  substrate  so
that  its  origin  is  at  the  center  of  the  substrate,  and  its
negative y-axis  bisects  the  substrate’s  primary  fiducial.
This  coordinate  system  is  defined  by  ISEM  to  be  the
“M20”    coordinate    system.    The    only    information
required  by  equipment  in  order  to  establish  an  “M20”
coordinate  system  is  the  substrate  size  and  the  type  of
fiducial, which are communicated using the ISEM data
items   named   SubstrateSize   and   Fiducial.   Another
ISEM  data  item  named  Orientation  identifies  how  the
substrate  is  loaded  on  the  equipment.  Note  that  the
SEMI M20 standard requires that the “M20” coordinate
system  is  fixed  on  the  substrate  and  is  not  affected  by
how  the  substrate  is  loaded  on  equipment.  Also,  as
stated in the SEMI M20 standard, an orientation of “0”
degrees  designates  a  substrate  loaded  on  equipment,
with   the   primary   fiducial   towards   the   operator   or
“down.”
R1-3.2    M20P Coordinate System —  ISEM  defines  the
M20P  coordinate  system  to  be  one  which  is  aligned  to
the  pattern  on  the  substrate.  The  M20P  coordinate
system  is  useful  because  in  many  cases,  it  is  more
significant  to  the  user  to  know  the  location  of  an
anomaly  relative  to  the  pattern  on  the  substrate  rather</p><p>SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 200042
than  relative  to  the  substrate  shape  and  dimensions.
ISEM  also  defines  the  M20P  coordinate  system  to  be
one which is designed to be “parallel” to the SEMI M20
coordinate system. In practice, because of experimental
errors, both the origins and the axes may differ slightly
from  their  intended  values  of  a  simple  translation  and
no rotation. Equipment should be designed to be able to
locate  the  alignment  sites,  given  the  various  possible
experimental errors.
R1-3.3  Establishing an M20P Coordinate System — A
minimum   of   two   alignment   sites   is   necessary   to
establish  an  M20P  coordinate  system  on  a  substrate.
Additional  sites  are  often  used  to  determine  a  scaling
ratio of the dimensions of the actual coordinate system
relative  to  the  dimensions  of  the  expected  coordinate
system  and  are  reported  using  the  ISEM  data  item  of
ScaleFactor.
XlateData  is  used  to  report  actual  coordinate  system
location.  Most  equipment  cannot  distinguish  whether
patterned  substrate  site  location  errors  are  due  to  the
substrate,    the    layout    on    the    substrate,    or    the
equipment’s   ability   to   locate   the   sites.   However,
information   that   is   available   through   the   use   of
patterned-substrate alignment sites can provide a means
for   identifying   potential   equipment   problems.   For
instance,  assume  that  the  only  pattern-layout  location
error  on  a  substrate  is  that  due  to  the  establishment  of
the  location  of  the  substrate  center  and  fiducial.  For
many  users  and  equipment  systems,  this  is  a  good
assumption. If this is the case, then the ISEM data item
named XlateData can  be  used  to  track  this  error.
Although  the  error  may  result  from  multiple  sources,
being  able  to  track  it  on  various  equipment  will  enable
users  to  apply  statistical  process  control  techniques  to
identify the specific sources.
Offset  sites  may  be  found  by  equipment  at  actual
locations  which  deviate  from  their  expected  locations
through   either   pattern   layout   errors   or   equipment
“stage”   or   imaging   errors.   Again,   in   a   controlled
manufacturing  process,  these  combined  errors  should
be   normally   distributed,   and   non-normal   deviations
may  indicate  possible  equipment  problems.  The  actual
position  of  a  site  relative  to  its  expected  position  shall
be  reported  through  the  use  of  the  ISEM  data  item
named Offset.
R1-4  Layout of Rectangular Pattern Elements
on a Substrate Using SEMI M20 Coordinate
System
Equipment   shall   be   capable   of   routine,   automated
operation  without  needing  substrate  layout  information
(e.g., field or die maps). However, having the capability
to  provide  substrate  layout  information  to  equipment
from  the  host  can  be  desirable.  ISEM  defines  a  means
to  do  this  in  this  section  for  substrates,  based  on  SEMI
M21    (Specification    for    Assigning    Addresses    to
Rectangular Elements in a Cartesian Array.) The SEMI
M21  standard  is  limited  to  defining  how  to  assign
“addresses”  to  elements  and  how  to  find  the  “array
center” element. It does not specify how the rectangular
pattern-elements  are  located  on  the  substrate.  In  this
section,  ISEM  defines  how  these  pattern-elements  are
located  on  a  substrate,  using  the  data  item  named
M21Data,    and    how    to    establish    within-element
coordinate  systems.  Any  additional  layout  information,
such  as  within-element  structure  details  or  element
attribute information, is beyond the scope of ISEM.
R1-4.1  ISEM “M21” Layouts
• An  “M21”  layout  consists  of  an  array  of  equal-
sized  rectangular  pattern-elements  with  no  space
between the pattern elements.
• ISEM  defines  the  “M21”  layout  on  a  substrate  to
include   all   pattern-elements   which   are   either
wholly or partially within the circumference of the
substrate.
• The ISEM approach is to define the pattern map by
specifying  the  M20P  coordinate  for  the  lower  left
corner of the minimum number of pattern-elements
needed to define the layout, along with the pattern-
element  addresses  (names).  For  a  non-tiled  layout,
the location and name of a single pattern-element is
sufficient  to  establish  the  “M21”  layout.  For  tiled
layouts,  the  location  and  name  of  one  pattern-
element  in  each  row  or  column  are  required.  Note
that  the  location  of  the  lower  left  corner  of  some
pattern-elements may be outside the circumference
of the substrate.
• The   “M21”   pattern-element   coordinate   system
shall have its x and y axes parallel to the respective
M20P  coordinate  system  axes  and  shall  have  their
origins  at  the  lower  left  corner  of  each  element.
The pattern-element coordinate system shall have a
name   and   a   specific   pattern-element   address
identifier per SEMI M21.
• Layout  definition  is  supported  only  for  host-to-
equipment      communications.      The      user      is
responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  pattern-element
addresses provided to the equipment agree with the
SEMI  M21  specification.  The  equipment  need  not
check  this,  other  than  to  ensure  that  there  are  not
conflicts   within   the   provided   layout,   and   shall
report  results  with  pattern-element  addresses  as
provided by the user.</p><p>SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 200043
•   “M21”  layouts  are  established  within  the  M20P  coordinate  system  and  need  not  require  any  additional
alignment site data than is needed to establish the M20P coordinate system. However, as with M20P, additional
alignment  may  be  necessary  because  of  errors  in  either  the  pattern  layout  or  the  equipment’s  ability  to  locate
features. Offset shall be used to report the location corrections that result from any within-element alignments.
R1-5  How an M20P Coordinate System Is Established on a Substrate
The following example is fairly basic. For this example, the M20P coordinate system has a zero translation from the
SEMI  M20  coordinate  system.  Also,  the  equipment  documentation  states  that  4  alignment  sites  are  required.  The
equipment  does  M20P  alignment  on  two  alignment  sites  and  does  a  low  resolution  and  then  a  high  resolution
alignment at each site. Note that the specific alignment point is different at the two resolutions, so the coordinates
are  slightly  different.  The  alignment  sites  are  defined  to  the  equipment  via  the  process  program  class  named
“TABLE-ALIGN-DEF”, as detailed below. The order of the sites in “TABLE-ALIGN-DEF” is not important. The
sites  are  then  selected  via  the  CPNAME  named  “ALIGNLIST”,  which  is  included  in  the  PP-SELECT  command.
The  order  of  the  sites  listed  in  “ALIGNLIST”  is  important  and  is  as-specified  in  the  equipment’s  documentation.
The first item is the alignment site for the first low resolution site, the second item is for the first high resolution site,
the third item is the second low resolution site, and the fourth is the second high resolution site.
“TABLE-ALIGN-DEF”

“ALIGNNAME”
L,4</p><ol><li>Coarse1</li><li>Fine1</li><li>Coarse2</li><li>Fine2
Using  this  information,  the  equipment  will  go  to  the  nominal  “M20”  location  for  Coarse1,  then  “find”  where  it
actually  is.  The  offset  between  the  nominal  “M20”  location  and  the  actual  “M20”  location  is  then  used  to  “find”
Fine1.  The  actual  M20  location  of  Fine1  is  saved.  The  process  is  then  repeated  for  Coarse2  and  Fine2.  The
equipment can now determine the “M20” to M20P offset from the nominal and actual coordinates. First, a summary
of the data:
xN1 = -60020yN1 = -205Nominal x and y data for the first fine site
xA1 = -59800yA1 = -150Actual x and y data for the first fine site
xN2 = +59980yN2 = +195Nominal x and y data for the second fine site
xA2 = +60060yA2 = +175Actual x and y data for the second fine site</li></ol><p>SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 200044
The   equipment   first   calculates   Theta,   using,   for
example, the formula:
Θ=tan
−1
MA−MN
1+MA MN




where MA and MN are, respectively, the slopes of the
lines connecting the two actual fine sites and the line
connecting    the    two    nominal    sites,    in    “M20”
coordinates, calculated as follows:

where C  and  D,  the  adjusted  site  1  coordinates  in  a
rotation-adjusted  coordinate  system,  are  calculated,
for example, using the formulas:
C=yA1−((xN1   sinΘ)+((yN1   cosΘ)
D=xA1−((xN1   cosΘ)−((yN1  sinΘ)
The equipment can also calculate a ScaleFactor term
to indicate the relative ratio between the length of the
vector connecting the nominal alignment sites and the
length  of  the  vector  connecting  the  actual  alignment
sites. This can be used, for example, to judge whether
there  is  a  problem  with  the  alignment  process,  since
the  difference  between  these  two  vectors  should  be
small.

APPLICATION NOTES
NOTE: The material contained in these Application Notes is not an official part of SEMI E30.1 and is not intended to modify or
supersede  the  official  standard.  Rather,  these  notes  describe  possible  methods  for  implementing  certain  ISEM  requirements
described by the standard and are included as reference material.
R2-1 Using ISEM Table Attributes to Specify Process Related Data Item Variable Values
R2-1.1  Section 11.1 (ISEM Table Data) allows the host to use ISEM Table attributes to specify product and process
related information related to the table data. The ISEM Variable Item Dictionary (Table 4) includes seven data items
intended to be used for this purpose. They are identified with the comment “This information may be added by the
host  in  the  ISEM  Tables.”  Identifying  the  value  of  variable  data  items  in  Table  attributes  is  not  covered  in  use  of
ISEM Tables. One method to accomplish this is to use attribute identifiers (ATTRIDn) that are the same identifiers
that  are  used  for  the  equipment  variable  data  items  (Table  R2-1).  (This  is  very  similar  to  the  method  specified  in
Section 12.5 to identify values to override the default values of variable process program parameters using the “PP-
SELECT” remote commands).

SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Information  and  Control  Committee  and  is  the
direct  responsibility  of  the  North  American  Global  Information  and  Control  Committee.    Current  edition
approved  by  the  North  American  Information  and  Control  Committee  on  October  14  and  November  27,</p><h1>2001</h1><ol start="2001"><li>Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  December  2001;  to  be  published  March  2002.    Originally
published July 2001.
The complete specification for this product includes all
general requirements of SEMI E30.
1  Purpose</li><li>1  This  document  establishes  a  Specific  Equipment
Model  (SEM)  for  Metrology  equipment  (MSEM).  The
MSEM   consists   of   equipment   characteristics   and
behaviors that are applicable to this class of equipment
and  are  required  to  be  implemented  in  addition  to  the
SEMI  E30  fundamental  requirements  and  additional
capabilities.
2  Scope</li><li>1  The  scope  of  this  document  is  limited  to  defining
the behavior of Metrology equipment as perceived by a
SEMI  Equipment  Communications  Standard  II  (SECS
II/SEMI  E5)  host  that  complies  with  the  SEMI  E30
model. It defines the view of the equipment through the
SECS II link. It does not define the internal operation of
the  equipment.  It  includes  a  specific  processing  state
model  as  the  basis  for  all  equipment  behavior  of  this
class.</li><li>2  This   document   assumes   that   the   SEMI   E30
fundamental requirements and all additional capabilities
except those noted in SEMI E30 Capabilities Section in
this  document  have  been  implemented  on  the  MSEM
equipment.    This  document  expands  the  SEMI  E30
Standard  requirements  and  capabilities  in  the  areas  of
the  processing  state  model,  collection  events,  Process
Program  management,  remote  commands,  data  item
variables, and coordinate systems.</li><li>3  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  The  intent  of  this  document  is  to  facilitate  the
integration  of  Metrology  equipment  into  an  automated
semiconductor  factory.  This  document  accomplishes
this  by  defining  an  operational  model  for  Metrology
equipment    as    viewed    by    a    factory    automation
controller.   This   definition   provides   a   standard   host
interface   and   equipment   operational   behavior.   This
document  applies  specifically  to  Metrology  equipment

6  Communication Requirements
6. 1  It is required that any MSEM compliant equipment
follow  the  Communications  State  Model  in  SEMI  E30.
In  addition  MSEM  compliant  equipment  shall  support
the    High    Speed    Messaging    Service    (HSMS-SS)
communication  Standard,  and  the  SECS-I  standard  for
sending SECS II messages over TCP/IP or RS232. The
user  may  determine  which  of  these  two  lower  level
transmission  protocols  is  used  in  each  installation.  The
reason  for  HSMS-SS  requirement    is  the  large  volume
of data that can be generated by this class of equipment.
7  State Models
7. 1  In  this  section  are  defined  the  equipment-specific
processing state model and other state models necessary
to   portray   the   expected   operational   states   of   the
equipment  to  enable  host  tracking  and  control  in  place
of   a   local   operator.   See   SEMI   E30   and   Other
References  section  for  additional  information  on  state
charts general rules and utilization.
7. 2  Processing   State   Model   Requirements    The
Processing state model is required to be implemented as
defined  in  the  next  sections  of  this  document.  A  state
model  consists  of  the  following:  state  model  diagram,
state  definitions    and  a  state  transition  table.  A  state
model  represents  the  host&#x27;s  view  of  the  equipment,  not
necessarily  the  actual  equipment  operation.  All  MSEM
state  model  transitions  shall  be  mapped  sequentially
into the appropriate actual equipment events that satisfy
the   requirements   of   those   transitions.   In   certain
implementations,  the  equipment  may  enter  a  state  and
have  already  satisfied  all  of  the  conditions  required  by
the  MSEM  state  model  for  transition  to  another  state.
The  equipment  makes  the  required  transition  without
any additional actions in this situation.
7. 3  Some  equipment  may  need  to  include  additional
states.  Additional  states  may  be  added,  but  shall  not
change   the   MSEM   defined   state   transitions.   All
expected transitions between MSEM states must occur.</p><p>SEMI E30.5-0302 © SEMI 2001, 20023

8  Collection Event List
8. 1  The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  identify  data  collection  events  for  Metrology  equipment  and  define  reporting
levels.
8. 2  Requirements — Only those collection events that are not associated with a change of state, and those requiring
specific  DVVAL&#x27;s  or  Reports  defined  in  the  SEM,  are  required  to  be  included  in  this  section.  All  SEMI  E30
required events are required by this SEM.
8. 2.1  Common collection events  collection events common to, and required on, all equipment of the class being
addressed.
8. 2.2  Configuration-specific  collection  events  collection  events  associated  with  a  specific  configuration  of  the
equipment class being addressed.
8. 3  Collection Event Tables
 The first table contains processing state event transitions and associated reports. The
second table contains additional events or actions and associated reports.
8. 3.1  All remote commands (S2F41) that are not preformed by the equipment before responding to the host (S2F42)
must generate an event indicating when the task was completed and whether it was successful.

9  Data Item Variables
9. 1  The purpose of this section is to define the list of data item variables pertinent to the specific equipment. Values
of these variables shall be available to the host via collection event reports and host  status queries.
9. 2  Requirement
 all  generic  variable  data  items  defined  in  SEMI  E30  are  required  by  all  Measurement
equipment. Data item variables are categorized as follows:
9. 2.1  Common Variables (CV)  variables common to all equipment of the class being addressed. These variables
are covered in Table 4 and must be used to regardless of the measurement tool type.
9. 2.2  Configuration-specific  variables  (CSV)    variables  associated  with  a  specific  configuration  of    the  above
equipment class.</p><p>SEMI E30.5-0302 © SEMI 2001, 200211
9. 2.2.1  The following rules should be adhered to in the reporting of these variables.
• The information should be sent using the corresponding formats defined on Table 4 and 5.
• For ASCII variables A<!-- -->[n]<!-- -->. If the actual data does not fill the entire field, blanks shall be used to complete the
field.
• For ASCII variables A<!-- -->[1..n]<!-- -->.  All fields should be left justified.
9. 3  Since  MSEM  is  generic  to  all  equipment  it  tries  not  to  specify  the  names  of  the  measurement  variables  to  be
sent  to  the  host.    MSEM  does  require  that  the  data  be  reported  at  site,  wafer  and  lot  levels.  It  should  include  the
option  of  reporting  data  at  the  individual  scan  level  if  supported  by  the  equipment.  It  is  a  requirement  that  the
equipment report at least: max, min, mean, standard deviation.  Additional statistic calculations may be added by the
equipment supplier. For each type of data collected by the equipment at the site level; the data must be summarized
and available for reporting at the wafer and lot levels.
9. 4  The following rules should be applied when reporting measurement values taken by the tool. The rules specify
the units to be used whenever these values are reported.
• All values specified should be reported in floating point format.
• All critical dimensions (lines and spaces) should be in microns.
• All overlay measurements should be in microns.
• All FTIR transmittance values and corresponding wavelengths should be reported in percent units and microns,
respectively.
• All film stress values should be reported in teradynes/cm-cm.
• All resistivity measurements should be reported in Ohm-cm.
• All film thickness measurements should be reported in Angstroms.
9. 5  Data  item  variables  should  be  documented  in  the  MSEM  data  item  variable  dictionary  using  the  following
format:
Variable NameCategoryDescriptionClassFormatComments
Where:
Variable Name:A unique name for the data item variable (this name is for reference only).
Category:Defined as Common or Configuration-Specific variables.
Description:If class is DVVAL, then the description must contain a statement of when data
is valid in terms of MSEM events.
Class:                   Data type of the item.
Format:                Acceptable formats are SEMI E5 lists, ASCII, floating point, unsigned integer or
signed integer.  A description of “ANY”, indicates that any of the above formats
are acceptable and is left to the tool vendor to decide. When required use SECS
Message Language format.
Comments:Any additional information pertinent to the variable name.
9. 6  Data Item Variable Types
9. 6.1  Equipment Constants (ECV) — can be changed by the host using S2F15. The operator may have the ability to
change some of the values, but the equipment does not change the values  on its own. The value of the equipment
constant may be queried by the host at any time using the S2F13/14 transaction.</p><p>SEMI E30.5-0302 © SEMI 2001, 200212
9. 6.2  Status Variables (SV) — are valid at all times. A SV may not be changed by the host but may be changed by
the equipment or the operator. The value of status variables may be queried by the host at anytime using the S1F3/4
or S6F19/20 transactions.
9. 6.3  Data Variables (DVVAL)  are variables which are valid only upon occurrence of specific collection events.
An attempt to read a data variable at the wrong time shall not generate an error, but the data reported may not have
relevant meaning.
9. 6.4  Variable  Data  (V)    this  is  a  class  of  variable  data  which  includes  all  the  previously  defined  types  of
variables.

10  Alarm List
10. 1  Since    each    model    of    equipment    differs    in
configuration,    it    is    not    practical    to    provide    an
exhaustive  list  of  all  possible  alarms.    Instead,  the
MSEM   is   requiring   the   two   tables   provided   as
described  in  SEMI  E30  (Document  Section).    Alarm
List  Table  which  is  intended  to  provide  for  equipment
configuration  specific  alarms  and  Alarm  ID,  Alarm
Set/Cleared Event Table.
10. 2  Alarm List Table
10. 2.1  The alarm list table contains examples of alarms
that   pertain   to   various   configurational   aspects   of
equipment.  These  examples  are  intended  to  illustrate
that  alarms  pertain  to  situations  in  which  there  exists  a
potential for exceeding physical safety limits associated
with  people,  equipment,  and  material  being  processed
as per the SEMI E30 definition of an alarm. See SEMI
E30 for further reference.
10. 3  Alarm ID, Alarm Set/Cleared Event Table
10. 3.1  The  Alarm  ID,  Alarm  Set/Cleared  Event  table
documents    the  association  of  each  ALID  to  a  set  and
cleared event as required by SEMI E30. See SEMI E30
for further reference.
11  Process Program Management
11. 1  Requirements
 The  MSEM  requires  that  the
SEMI  E30  capability  of  Process  Program  Management
be  fully  supported  for  this  class  of  equipment.    The
MSEM is also requiring that the Process Program have
a   structure   that   enables   the   user   to   build   Process
Programs with default conditions that can be overridden
for  a  run.  MSEM  is  requiring  the  ability  to  vary;  the
quantity    of    substrates    measured,    the    alignment
information used and the number and/or location of the
sites   to   be   measured   through   the   uses   of   Process
Program variable parameters.  The concepts of Process
Program   Structure   and   Process   Program   variable
parameters are discussed in the following sections.
11. 2   Process Program Structure
11. 2.1  Definition  and  Rules  for  Process  Programs

A    Process    Program    contains    information    and/or
instructions  required  for  the  metrology  equipment  to
process  a  given  run  of  material.    Equipment  constants
can be used to supplement the information contained in
a Process Program.
11. 2.1.1  The  Process  Program  shall  supply  all  of  the
information  required  for  a  remotely  executed  run  to  be
processed    without    operator    intervention.        Any
information   that   is   normally   requested   from   the
operator console in manual operation shall have default
values assigned in the body of the Process Program.
11. 2.1.2  Process-program parameters are used to tailor
a  specific  run  of  material  and  do  not  permanently
modify  the  Process  Program.    They  will  remain  in
effect  only  until  the  next  run  or  until  the  next  PP-
UPDATE     or     PP-SELECT,     PP-ASSIGN     remote
command.
11. 2.1.3  MSEM   is   requiring   the   ability   to   define
specific Process Program variable parameters to; define
what  substrates  are  to  be  measured  (Process  SlotList),
what sites are to be measured (SiteList  or M21SiteList)
and  what  aligns  are  used  by  the  Process  Program
(AlignList  or  M21AlignList).  If  the  MSEM  equipment
is  using  the  SEMI  M21  coordinate  system  then  an
additional   Process   Program   variable   parameter   is
required     what     elements     are     to     be     measured
(ElementList).
11. 2.2  Definition    of    Process    Program    Variable
Parameters
 A  process-program  parameter  specifies
a value that temporarily modifies the value of a variable
parameter in a Process Program.  A  variable parameter
is formally defined within a process-program body and
contains:
• a  variable  parameter  name  that  is  unique  in  the
body
• a  parameter  initial  value,  known  as  default  value,
for  use  when  the  Process  Program  is  selected  for
execution   without   specification   of   an   override
value for this variable parameter.
11. 2.3  The  Equipment  may  also  support  the  definition
including:
• a  parameter  restriction  that  represents  one  or  more
conditions    that    any    value    specified    for    the
parameter must satisfy.
• a   CP-NAME   in   a   remote   command   must   be
identical   to   a   variable   parameter   name   in   the
Process Program specified in the remote command.
If  the  Equipment  allows  Sub-process  Programs,  a
Sub-process  Program  reference  may  also  specify
parameters.
11. 2.4  Relationship   of   Process   Program   Variable
Parameter
 The  PP-SELECT,  PP-ASSIGN  or  PP-
UPDATE  remote  commands  can  be  used  to  modify
variables     within     the     Process     Program.          The
modification  to  process-program  variables  is  done  by
using CP-NAME/CP-VAL pairs within the command.</p><p>SEMI E30.5-0302 © SEMI 2001, 200216
11. 2.5  Sub-Process  Programs   Equipment  may  allow  a  main  Process  Program  to  reference  Sub-process
Programs. A main Process Program is one that can be referenced by the host.  A Sub-process Program is a Process
Program that is referenced by a main Process Program or by other Sub-process Programs. No Sub-process Program
may  reference  its  main  Process  Program.  If  the  Equipment  supports  sub-process-program  references,  it  must  be
possible for the host to determine which Sub-process Programs are referenced in all Process Programs.
11. 2.5.1  Before execution of a main Process Program can begin, the presence of all the Sub-process Programs that it
references must be verified by the Equipment.  If they are not all present, an error collection event must occur.  It
must be possible to include in the event report which Sub-process Programs are missing.  For a formatted Process
Program, the error is reported using an S7F27 message.

11. 2.7  DEF-LIST-TABLE Description  DEF-LIST types of tables are used by the equipment in conjunction with
the Process Programs. The DEF-LIST  table structures provide a means to transfer to equipment a list of a particular
type of information.  The DEF-LIST table structures are used by the host to send  information to equipment for later
use  in  association  with  a  Process  Program.    Each  DEF-LIST  that  is  sent  has  a  unique  Table  name  and  each  list
element  in  the  DEF-LIST  has  several  components  including  a  name  (Site-Name,  or  Align-Name)  as  well  as  other
components.  A specific list row can be accessed for use with a specific Process Program by giving the DEF-LIST
table name and the specific row name.</p><p>SEMI E30.5-0302 © SEMI 2001, 200217
11. 2.7.1  There are five types of DEF-LIST tables:
• SITE-DEF-LIST:  A list of Sites and their attributes, typically the list of sites to be measured.
• ALIGN-DEF-LIST:  A list of alignment sites and their attributes.
• M21-ELEMENT-DEF-LIST:    A  list  of  element  ID  and  their  low  left  hand  location  in  M20P  or  SEMI  M20
coordinates.
• M21-ELEMENT-SITE-DEF-LIST: A list of ElementID&#x27;s and what sites are to be measured within that element.
• M21-ELEMENT-ALIGN-DEF-LIST:  a list of ElementID&#x27;s and the alignment sites to be used at each.
NOTE 2:  The attributes are equipment-defined.
11. 2.7.2  To support the SiteList, and AlignList, for SEMI M20, M20P and SEMI M21, the following types of tables
must   be   implemented:      SITE-DEF-LIST,   ALIGN-DEF-LIST,   or   M21-ELEMENT-SITE-   DEF-LIST,   M21-
ELEMENT-ALIGN-DEF-LIST  and  M21-ELEMENT-DEF-LIST.    A  host  would  send  a  DEF-LIST  to  equipment
using standard transfer methods for tables as defined by ARAMS (SEMI E58).  MSEM requires that the following
columns be included in the DEF-LIST tables.  The DEF-LIST-TABLE  components table  defines  the DEF-LIST
column names and their allowable format is given below.

12  Remote Commands
12. 1  The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  identify  the
MSEM     required     remote     commands,     command
parameters, and valid commands versus MSEM states.
12. 2  Requirements
  The  following  capabilities  are
required:
• StartProcessing
• Stop Processing
• Temporaly Suspend Processing
• Resume Processing
• Abort Processing
• Select  Process  Programs,  Material  and/or  Sites  to
Measure
• Report   Location   of   Material   Found   within   a
cassette
12. 3  All  the  remote  commands  defined  by  MSEM  are
required   unless   they   have   been   qualified   by   the
statement  “if  the  equipment  supports  this  functionality
it shall use this command”. Then, they are only required
if the equipment supports the functionality necessary to
support  the  command.    A  good  example  of  this  is  the
MAP-CASSETTE command if the equipment does not
have  the  hardware  necessary  to  scan  a  cassette  for  the
presence of substrates in slots then the command is not
required   by   the   MSEM.   The   alphanumeric   strings
defined   by   MSEM   for   RCMD   and   CPNAME   are
required.
12. 4  Definitions
12. 4.1  Host  Command  Parameter  (CPNAME/CPVAL)
— a parameter name/value associated with a particular
host  command  (S2,F49).    This  document  will  specify
unique  names  (CPNAMEs)  and  values  (CPVALs)  for
many  command  parameters.    Note  that  if  there  are  no
associated parameters a zero-length list is sent.
12. 5  Remote  Commands  Description  —  this  section
describes     required     functionality,     suppliers     may
implement additional commands. The following remote
commands  (RCMDs)  must  be  supported  as  described
below.
NOTE  2:  The  terms  “current  cycle”  and  “safe  point”  used
below are to be defined by the supplier.
12. 5.1  ABORT   terminate  the  current  cycle  prior  to
its  completion.    Abort  has  the  intent  of  immediately
stopping  the  process  and  is  used  because  of  abnormal
conditions.      Abort   makes   no   guarantee   about   the
subsequent condition of material except as noted in the
CPNAME ABORT-LEVEL description.
12. 5.2  CLEANUP
 Process   Program   deselection,
removal  of  all  material  to  output  locations  and  any
equipment  specific  activities  needed  to  transition  into
the  IDLE  state.    Completion  of  this  command  should
generate a collection event report.
12. 5.3  NEXT-MATERIAL
 processing  of  the  current
substrate is halted at the first safe point and unloaded to
the target cassette location.  Next-material has the intent
of allowing the host to skip measurement of the current
substrate.      This   is   a   trigger   for   processing   state
transition from WORKING to UNLOAD.
12. 5.4  PAUSE
 suspend  processing  temporarily  at
the  next  safe  point.    Pause  has  the  intent  of  resuming
the  process  at  the  same  point  where  it  was  paused.
RESUME  or  PP-UPDATE  may  be  used  to  resume  the
process.
12. 5.5  PP-ASSIGN
 instructs the equipment to assign
a  process  to  a  carrier  ID(s)/location(s)  and  place  the
exchange  station  in  the  process  queue  with  the  given
priority. Only one assignment is allowed for a exchange
station.    Without  specifying  a  priority,  the  material  is
queued  with  the  default  priority.    Material  with  equal
priority   are   queued   in   the   order   the   PP-ASSIGN
commands are received.  If the equipment supports the
functionality   of   queuing   material,   it   will   use   this
command.
12. 5.6  PP-SELECT
 instructs the equipment to make
the   requested   Process   Program(s)   available   in   the
execution  area.    Additionally,  to  reduce  the  number  of
Process  Programs  on  the  equipment,  PP-SELECT  may
define  the  material  to  be  measured,  measurement  site
locations,   and/or   the   information   needed   for   site
alignment;    default    values    shall    be    used    if    this
information  is  not  specified.    This  is  a  trigger  for  the
processing state transition from IDLE to SETTING UP.
All  Process  Programs  specified  in  the  command  are  to
be validated
12. 5.7  PP-UPDATE
 provides  the  ability  to  alter
Process    Program    variables    during    the    PAUSED
processing  state.    Any  CPNAMEs  specified  in  PP-
UPDATE  will  replace  the  previous  definitions.    This
command   will   RESUME   the   process.      If   the   PP-
UPDATE  fails,  the  Process  Program  variables  present
prior to the PP-UPDATE are retained.  If no parameters
values are specified, the defaults are used.
12. 5.8  RESUME

RELATED INFORMATION 1
SEM UNIQUE CAPABILITIES
NOTE:  This related information is not an official part of SEMI E30.5 and was derived from work developed in the Metrology
Specific  Equipment  Model  Task  Force  in  North  America.    This  related  information  was  approved  for  publication  by  full  letter
ballot on April 30, 2001.
R1-1.      Measurement   Site   Location    Metrology
equipment  most  often  is  used  to  make  measurements
and   report   results   at   specific   sites   on   a   substrate.
Unfortunately,   equipment   suppliers   and   users   have
adopted  different  formats  for  describing  measurement
site   location   information.      This   has   led   to   three
problems  which  increase  the  cost  of  metrology.    First,
metrology  equipment  suppliers  must  provide  formats
which meet conflicting requirements of their customers,
adding to equipment development costs.  Second, users
must  transpose  information  from  different  systems  to
their own format in order to use metrology data.  Third,
site  location  information  is  often  an  integral  part  of
recipe  set  up,  often  requiring  that  an  actual  product
sample  be  available  for  “training”  the  site  location
information   on   the   equipment.      For   users   who
manufacture   many   different   products   on   common
substrates,   multiple   metrology   “recipes”   must   be
developed  where  the  only  differences  are  site  location
information.    This  information  is  known  to  the  user
from  product  design  data,  and  should  not  need  to  be
&quot;learned&quot; uniquely on various metrology equipment.
R1-1.1    In  order  to  avoid  these  problems,  MSEM
defines  specific  formats  for  identifying  and  reporting
site    location    information    on    substrates.        The
MSEM-required  formats  are  intended  to  minimize  the
number and type of site location format transformations
needing  to  be  supported  by  both  metrology  equipment
suppliers  and  users.    All  MSEM-required  site  location
formats    involve    the    use    of    an    MSEM-defined
right-handed  Cartesian  coordinate  system,  established
on   substrates   in   an   MSEM-defined   manner.      This
release  of  MSEM  defines  these  only  for  silicon  wafer
substrates,  based  on  SEMI  standard  M20.    Additional
substrate  types  may  be  included  in  future  revisions  of
MSEM, if required.
R1-1.2      MSEM   requires   that   equipment   have   the
capability  to  use  site  location  information  that  is  based
on  the  user&#x27;s  product  designs,  which  the  user  must
provide  in  the  appropriate  MSEM-required  format.    In
other  words,  equipment  shall  not  require  that  a  sample
substrate  be  used  to  “train”  site  locations  when  users
can provide this information from product design data.
R1-1.3    MSEM-compliant  equipment  shall  have  the
capability  to  define,  locate,  measure,  and  report  site
information      using      only      the      MSEM-defined
right-handed Cartesian coordinate system formats.  This
requirement  does  not  preclude  equipment  from  having
additional   capability   for   defining   or   reporting   site
location  information  using  other  formats.    One  such
additional  format  is  defined  in  MSEM  for  patterned
silicon wafer substrates, based on SEMI standard SEMI
M21.    MSEM-compliant  equipment  is  not  required  to
have  this  “M21”  format  capability,  but  must  use  the
MSEM “M21” format if it is provided.
R1-1.4    Specific  MSEM  information    that  defines  site
location information includes ; the data items AlignList
and  SiteList;  the  CPNAMEs    CP-ALIGNLIST  and
CP-SITELIST  and  the  TABLE  type  named  ALIGN-
DEF-LIST  and  SITE-DEF-LIST.    Notice  that  multiple
sites can first be Defined using the appropriate Process
Program   class   named   ALIGN-DEF-LIST   or   SITE-
DEF-LIST,  then  selected  by  using  the  ALIGN-NAME
or SITENAME in an MSEM defined remote command
that  use  CP-ALIGNLIST  AND  CP-SITELIST.    This
information    is    similarly    defined    for    the    “M21”
coordinate   system   plus   an   additional   CPNAME   of
ELEMENTLIST   which   lists   the   ElementIDs   to   be
measured on the silicon wafers.
R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer
R1-2.1     Requirements


 MSEM     defines     two
right-handed  Cartesian  coordinate  systems  for  use  on
silicon  wafers.    These  are  identified  as  the  “M20”  and
“M20P”  coordinate  systems.    Both  are  based  on  SEMI
standard  M20.  The  SEMI  M20  standard  describes  how
to map a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system to a
wafer so that its origin is at the center of the wafer, and
its  negative  y-axis  bisects  the  wafer&#x27;s  primary  fiducial.
This  coordinate  system  is  defined  by  MSEM  to  be  the
“M20” coordinate system.  MSEM defines the &quot;M20P&quot;
coordinate  systems  to  be  one  which  is  aligned  to  the
pattern  on  the  wafer.    Ideally,  there  is  no  difference
between  the  “M20P”  and  “M20”  coordinate  system.  In
the real world, there is a difference, due to experimental
errors.    This  is  explained  further  in  the  following
sections.
R1-2.2    Implementation
   The   only   information
required  by  equipment  in  order  to  establish  an  “M20”
coordinate system is the wafer size and type of fiducial.
This  is  provided  by  way  of  the  MSEM  data  items
named   WaferSize   and   Fiducial.   Another   data   item
named  Orientation  provides  for  control  over  how  the
wafer  is  loaded  on  equipment.
