5  Terminology
5. 1  Acronyms and Abbreviations
5. 1.1  AOV — Air-operated valves
5. 1.2  ASO — Automatic shutoff valve
5. 1.3  POC — Point of connection
5. 1.4  POU — Point of use
5. 1.5  VMB — Valve manifold box
5. 2  Definitions
5. 2.1  air-operated  valves  (AOV) —  are  those  which
require  pneumatic  energy  to  initiate  or  terminate  flow
or  to  change  flow  path  (e.g.,  normally  closed,  partially
open, double acting).
5. 2.2  automatic shutoff valve (ASO) — a mechanically,
electrically, or pneumatically activated valve which has
the sole purpose of terminating flow if a predetermined
condition  is  exceeded.  For  cryogenic  supply  systems,
ASO’s  are  used  in  conjunction  with  a  low  temperature
sensing device.
5. 2.3  check    valve    —    a    mechanical    gas    system
component which prevents reverse flow.
5. 2.4  effluent   treatment   system   —   a   device   which,
through mechanical, chemical, cryogenic, absorbent, or
other    means,    abates    hazardous    gas    effluent    to
“environmentally     safe     levels”     through     dilution,
neutralization, entrapment, or distillation.
5. 2.5  excess  flow  device  —  a  mechanical  or  electrical
component  which  senses  and  signals  an  AOV  or  itself
to  terminate  flow  in  the  event  predetermined  flow  is
exceeded.
5. 2.6  face  seal  fitting  —  a  high  purity  fitting  which
incorporates  two  machined  faces  and  a  metallic  gasket
within  a  male/female  nut  configuration  to  attain  a  high
leak integrity seal.
5. 2.7  filter — a porous device, generally constructed of
polymer,  metal,  or  ceramics  and  housed  in  a  metal
chamber,  which  traps  particles,  preventing  them  from
being transported downstream.
5. 2.8  flow   restrictor   —   a   component,   generally   an
orifice,     which     prohibits     gas     flow     beyond     a
predetermined flow.
5. 2.9  gas  box  —  a  gas  distribution  subsystem  which
generally contains the final shut-off valve(s) prior to the
POC. It may also contain filter(s) and a regulator.
5. 2.10  hazardous     gas     detectors     —     analytical
instruments  which  placed  in  strategic  locations  in  and



SEMI F22-1102 © SEMI 1997, 2002 2
around  gas  distribution  systems  and  components  are
used   to   detect   potentially   unnoticeable   releases   at
extremely low levels.
5. 2.11  low temperature sensing device — a component
which protects the system downstream of the vaporizer
from  cryogenic  temperatures  by  initiating  an  alarm  or
triggering a valve shut-down.
5. 2.12  nitrogen  generation  plant  —  a  system  which,
generally  through  cryogenic  distillation,  separates  and
purifies nitrogen from ambient air. Other air separation
techniques  may  be  used  but  are  not  considered  in  this
document.
5. 2.13  point  of  connection  (POC)  —  is  often  used
interchangeably    with    POU,    indicating    the    final
connection between the system and the process tool.
5. 2.14  point    of    use    (POU)    —    is    often    used
interchangeably    with    POC,    indicating    the    final
connection between the system and the process tool.
5. 2.15  pressure  relief  valve  —  a  device  which,  at  a
given design pressure set point, releases gas pressure to
prevent system over-pressurization.
5. 2.16  pressure   transducer   —   a   component   which
mechanically or electrically senses the pressure within a
gas  system  and  transmits  a  signal  to  a  readout  or  a
control device.
5. 2.17  process  gas  panel  —  a  subsystem,  generally
contained within a gas cabinet, that delivers process gas
from   the   cylinder   to   the   specialty   gas   distribution
system.
5. 2.18  purifier  —  generally  a  catalytic,  resinous,  or
diatomaceous  material  within  a  pressure  vessel  which
removes  particulate  and/or  trace  gas  impurities  from  a
gas stream.
5. 2.19  regulator   —   generally   a   mechanical   device
which alters the pressure within a gas system.
5. 2.20  segregation    —    a    practice    in    design    and
operation  to  prevent  non-compatible  gases  from  co-
mingling.
5. 2.21  tube  trailer  —  a  bulk  gas  supply  system  which
manifolds    high    pressure,    DOT-specified,    vessels
(cylindrical tubes) on a portable trailer.
5. 2.22  vacuum  generator  —  a  component  in  a  process
gas  panel  which,  via  a  suction  created  by  an  inert  gas
venturi,  allows  for  evacuation  of  the  gas  system  to
levels of 16.7 kPa (25" mercury) or less.
5. 2.23  valve  manifold  box  (VMB)  —  a  gas  distribution
subsystem designed to allow the distribution of a single
process   cylinder   gas   to   multiple   process   tools.   Its
manifold  design  uses  a  series  of  valves  (manual  or
AOV), regulators, filters, and vacuum generator(s), and
may be controlled manually or automatically.
5. 2.24  vaporizer  —  a  component  which,  through  heat
transfer,  is  designed  to  convert  a  cryogenic  liquid  to  a
gas.

Pa (8 atmospheres) with a
50%   counting   efficiency   should   reach   90%   at   0.3
micrometer  or  smaller.    The  resolving  power  of  the
instrument  near  0.2  micrometer  should  be  no  worse
than  10%.    The  counting  efficiency  is  determined  by  a
calibration at 1 ◊ 10

Pa (1 atmosphere) pressure using
polystyrene latex spheres in an inert gas and a reference
particle  counter  with  a  proven  counting  efficiency  of
not less than 95% at 0.2 micrometer.
NOTE 2:  Suitable   test   methods   for   determining   counting
efficiency  and  resolving  power  are  contained  in  Japanese
Industrial  Standard  JIS  B  9921  (1989),  ìLight  Scattering
Automatic Particle Counterî.  More sensitive particle counters
result in a higher measured particle concentration.
7  Test Method
NOTE    3:        The    details    of    the    sampling    configuration,
measurement procedure, and instrument calibration procedure
and frequency, must be agreed upon by the user and supplier,
taking  into  account  good  engineering  practice.    Material
safety  data  sheets  should  be  referred  to  for  safe  handling  of
specialty gases.

believed to be free of particles 0.2 micrometer or more
in  diameter,  through  the  instrument  and  recording  the
total  number  of  counts.    The  nitrogen  purge  assembly
for  performing  this  test,  using  a  filter  which  removes
particles in this size range, is shown in Figure 1.  Count
a  minimum  of  3  equal  intervals,  each  of  at  least  25
standard liters (0.95 SCF), or 30 minutes, whichever is
greater.    Calculate
B

Particle Samples from Flammable Specialty Gas
Systems
7. 2  The sampling point should be near the point of use,
and  sampling  lines  should  be  clean  and  as  short  as
possible.
7. 3    The  sampling  system  configuration  is  shown  in
Figure 1.  The specialty gas system should be connected
through  a  sample  valve  directly  to  the  particle  counter,
a  pressure  gauge,  and  a  flow  control  device  (FCD).
When  sampling  is  performed  using  wall  tap  sample
ports, the aspiration efficiency should be checked using
the  method  described  in  Related  Information  1.    The
sampling system should contain minimum dead volume
and   sample   tube   length.      All   components   in   the
sampling  system  should  be  leak  tight  and  cleaned  in
accordance  with  good  engineering  practice.    A  leak
check of the system should be performed in accordance
with normally accepted practice.  The FCD may be part
of  the  particle  counter.    The  particle  counter  should  be
maintained at the pressure of the gas system.  The FCD
can  be  a  metering  valve  and  a  flow  meter  or  a  critical
orifice.  The exhaust line should be leak tight and piped
to  an  appropriate  exhaust  system.    The  exhaust  line
diameter  should  be  large  enough  to  produce  no  more
than 1 ◊ 10
4
Pa (1.5 psi) pressure drop during purge and
sample flow.
NOTE  4:    The  alternative  sampling  configurations  described
in SEMI C6.3 can also be used for hydrogen.
7. 4    Using  the  high  purity  nitrogen  system  shown  in
Figure   1,   purge   the   sampling   system   and   particle
counter   for   at   least   5   minutes   at   the   instrument
manufacturerís  specified  flow  rate.    The  exact  purge
time  should  take  into  account  the  reactivity  of  the  gas


SEMI F23-0697 © SEMI 1997, 2003 3
and should be sufficient to purge the entire exhaust line.
An  oxygen  sensor  should  be  placed  at  the  system
exhaust to verify less than 1 ppmv oxygen in the purge
nitrogen.      The   purging   must   be   performed   before
flammable  gas  is  introduced  into  the  sampling  system
and  after  completion  of  the  measurement.    The  valve
leading  to  the  oxygen  sensor  should  be  closed  when
flammable  gas  is  being  sampled.    The  valve  leading
from the purge nitrogen system should be closed when
sampling specialty gases and/or a back flow prevention
device should be included in the purge nitrogen system.
NOTE  5:    It  is  known  that  flammable  gases  can  react  with
oxygen  present  in  the  sampling  system.    Nitrogen  purging  of
the  sampling  system  reduces  the  risk  of  reaction.    The  purity
of  the  purge  nitrogen  should  be  sufficient  to  remove  reactive
substances from the sampling system.
7. 5    Count  the  particles  in  each  of  at  least  3  equal
intervals.    Each  sample  interval  must  be  at  least  25
standard liters (0.95 SCF), or 30 minutes, whichever is
greater.    Data  obtained  during  the  first  5  minutes  after
the  sample  valve  is  opened  may  be  discarded.    Record
the  number  of  counts  in  the  sample  volume  for  each
interval.  Calculate
C
X and S
C
, as defined in Section 4.
NOTE  6:    For  small  volume  specialty  gas  systems,  the  user
and  supplier  may  agree  to  a  smaller  sample  gas  volume  than
that stated above.  The sample point location and the process
line pressure and flow rate during the test should be recorded.

R1-1  Introduction
R1-1.1        Isokinetic    sample    probes    are    usually    not
provided in speciality gas systems.  Particle sampling is
usually  performed  using  wall  tap  sample  ports.    Wall
tap  sample  ports  are  oriented  90∞  to  the  process  line
flow as shown in Figure R1-1.  Non-isokinetic flow into
the  sample  tube  results  from  the  90∞  change  in  flow
direction.    Additional  deviation  from  isokinesis  can
result  from  stream  tube  contraction  or  expansion  when
the  velocities  U  and  v  are  not  equal.    The  effects  of
non-isokinetic   flow   on   the   measurement   should   be
checked.    The  particle  sampling  process  should  be
performed with an aspiration efficiency close to 1.

R1-1  Introduction
R1-1.1        Isokinetic    sample    probes    are    usually    not
provided in speciality gas systems.  Particle sampling is
usually  performed  using  wall  tap  sample  ports.    Wall
tap  sample  ports  are  oriented  90∞  to  the  process  line
flow as shown in Figure R1-1.  Non-isokinetic flow into
the  sample  tube  results  from  the  90∞  change  in  flow
direction.    Additional  deviation  from  isokinesis  can
result  from  stream  tube  contraction  or  expansion  when
the  velocities  U  and  v  are  not  equal.    The  effects  of
non-isokinetic   flow   on   the   measurement   should   be
checked.    The  particle  sampling  process  should  be
performed with an aspiration efficiency close to 1.

The   counting   efficiency   should   reach   90%   at   0.3
micrometer  or  smaller.    The  resolving  power  of  the
instrument  near  0.2  micrometer  should  be  no  worse
than  10%.    The  counting  efficiency  is  determined  by  a
calibration at 1 ◊ 10
5
Pa (1 atmosphere) pressure using
polystyrene latex spheres in an inert gas and a reference
particle  counter  with  a  proven  counting  efficiency  of
not less than 95% at 0.2 micrometer.
NOTE 2:  Suitable   test   methods   for   determining   counting
efficiency  and  resolving  power  are  contained  in  Japanese
Industrial  Standard  JIS  B  9921  (1989),  ìLight  Scattering
Automatic Particle Counterî.  More sensitive particle counters
result in a higher measured particle concentration.
7  Test Method
NOTE    3:        The    details    of    the    sampling    configuration,
measurement procedure, and instrument calibration procedure
and frequency must be agreed upon by the user and supplier,
taking  into  account  good  engineering  practice.    Material
safety  data  sheets  should  be  referred  to  for  safe  handling  of
specialty gases.
7. 1    Determine  the  average  observed  concentration  of
counts  in  the  background  (
B
X)  by  passing  nitrogen,
believed to be free of particles 0.2 micrometer or more
in  diameter,  through  the  instrument  and  recording  the
total  number  of  counts.    The  nitrogen  purge  assembly
for  performing  this  test,  using  a  filter  which  removes
particles in this size range, is shown in Figure 1.  Count
a  minimum  of  3  equal  intervals,  each  of  at  least  25
standard liters (0.95 SCF), or 30 minutes, whichever is
greater.    Calculate

Obtaining Particle Samples from
Oxidant Specialty Gas Systems
7. 2  The sampling point should be near the point of use,
and sampling lines should be clean, free of combustible
substances, and as short as possible.
7. 3    The  sampling  system  configuration  is  shown  in
Figure 1.  The specialty gas system should be connected
through  a  sample  valve  directly  to  the  particle  counter,
a  pressure  gauge,  and  a  flow  control  device  (FCD).
When  sampling  is  performed  using  wall  tap  sample
ports, the aspiration efficiency should be checked using
the  method  described  in  Related  Information  1.    The
sampling system should contain minimum dead volume
and   sample   tube   length.      All   components   in   the
sampling  system  should  be  leak  tight  and  cleaned  in
accordance  with  good  engineering  practice.    A  leak
check of the system should be performed in accordance
with normally accepted practice.  The FCD may be part
of  the  particle  counter.    The  particle  counter  should  be
maintained at the pressure of the gas system.  The FCD
can  be  a  metering  valve  and  a  flow  meter  or  a  critical
orifice.  The exhaust line should be leak tight and piped
to  an  appropriate  exhaust  system.    The  exhaust  line
diameter  should  be  large  enough  to  produce  no  more
than 1 ◊ 10
4
Pa (1.5 psi) pressure drop during purge and
sample flow.
NOTE  4:    The  alternative  sampling  configurations  described
in SEMI C6.2 can also be used for oxygen.
7. 4    Using  the  high  purity  nitrogen  system  shown  in
Figure   1,   purge   the   sampling   system   and   particle


SEMI F25-0697 © SEMI 1997, 2003 3
counter   for   at   least   5   minutes   at   the   instrument
manufacturerís  specified  flow  rate.    The  exact  purge
time  should  take  into  account  the  reactivity  of  the  gas
and should be sufficient to purge the entire exhaust line.
The  purging  must  be  performed  before  oxidant  gas  is
introduced    into    the    sampling    system    and    after
completion  of  the  measurement.    The  valve  leading
from the purge nitrogen system should be closed when
sampling specialty gases and/or a back flow prevention
device should be included in the purge nitrogen system.
NOTE   5:      It   is   known   that   oxidant   gases,   although   non-
flammable, may support combustion.  Cleaning in accordance
with  good  engineering  practice  and  nitrogen  purging  of  the
sampling system reduce the risk of reaction.  The purity of the
purge   nitrogen   should   be   sufficient   to   remove   reactive
substances from the sampling system.
7. 5    Count  the  particles  in  each  of  at  least  3  equal
intervals.    Each  sample  interval  must  be  at  least  25
standard liters (0.95 SCF), or 30 minutes, whichever is
greater.    Data  obtained  during  the  first  5  minutes  after
the  sample  valve  is  opened  may  be  discarded.    Record
the  number  of  counts  in  the  sample  volume  for  each
interval.  Calculate
C
X and S
C
, as defined in Section 4.
NOTE  6:    For  small  volume  specialty  gas  systems,  the  user
and  supplier  may  agree  to  a  smaller  sample  gas  volume  than
that stated above.  The sample point location and the process
line pressure and flow rate during the test should be recorded.

R1-1  Introduction
R1-1.1        Isokinetic    sample    probes    are    usually    not
provided in speciality gas systems.  Particle sampling is
usually  performed  using  wall  tap  sample  ports.    Wall
tap  sample  ports  are  oriented  90∞  to  the  process  line
flow as shown in Figure R1-1.  Non-isokinetic flow into
the  sample  tube  results  from  the  90∞  change  in  flow
direction.    Additional  deviation  from  isokinesis  can
result  from  stream  tube  contraction  or  expansion  when
the  velocities  U  and  v  are  not  equal.    The  effects  of
non-isokinetic   flow   on   the   measurement   should   be
checked.    The  particle  sampling  process  should  be
performed with an aspiration efficiency close to 1.

pressure  of  up  to  8  ◊  10
5
Pa (8 atmospheres) with a
50%   counting   efficiency   should   reach   90%   at   0.3
micrometer  or  smaller.    The  resolving  power  of  the
instrument  near  0.2  micrometer  should  be  no  worse
than  10%.    The  counting  efficiency  is  determined  by  a
calibration at 1 ◊ 10
5
Pa (1 atmosphere) pressure using
polystyrene latex spheres in an inert gas and a reference
particle  counter  with  a  proven  counting  efficiency  of
not less than 95% at 0.2 micrometer.
NOTE 2:  Suitable   test   methods   for   determining   counting
efficiency  and  resolving  power  are  contained  in  Japanese
Industrial  Standard  JIS  B  9921  (1989),  ìLight  Scattering
Automatic Particle Counterî.  More sensitive particle counters
result in a higher measured particle concentration.
7  Test Method
NOTE    3:        The    details    of    the    sampling    configuration,
measurement procedure, and instrument calibration procedure
and frequency must be agreed upon by the user and supplier,
taking  into  account  good  engineering  practice.    Material
safety  data  sheets  should  be  referred  to  for  safe  handling  of
specialty gases.
7. 1    Determine  the  average  observed  concentration  of
counts  in  the  background  (
B
X)  by  passing  nitrogen,
believed to be free of particles 0.2 micrometer or more
in  diameter,  through  the  instrument  and  recording  the
total  number  of  counts.    The  nitrogen  purge  assembly
for  performing  this  test,  using  a  filter  which  removes
particles in this size range, is shown in Figure 1.  Count
a  minimum  of  3  equal  intervals,  each  of  at  least  25
standard liters (0.95 SCF), or 30 minutes, whichever is
greater.    Calculate
B

Gas Systems

7. 2  The sampling point should be near the point of use,
and  sampling  lines  should  be  clean  and  as  short  as
possible.
7. 3    The  sampling  system  configuration  is  shown  in
Figure 1.  The specialty gas system should be connected
through  a  sample  valve  directly  to  the  particle  counter,
a  pressure  gauge,  and  a  flow  control  device  (FCD).
When  sampling  is  performed  using  wall  tap  sample
ports, the aspiration efficiency should be checked using
the  method  described  in  Related  Information  1.    The
sampling system should contain minimum dead volume
and   sample   tube   length.      All   components   in   the
sampling  system  should  be  leak  tight  and  cleaned  in
accordance  with  good  engineering  practice.    A  leak
check of the system should be performed in accordance
with normally accepted practice.  The FCD may be part
of  the  particle  counter.    The  particle  counter  should  be
maintained at the pressure of the gas system.  The FCD
can  be  a  metering  valve  and  a  flow  meter  or  a  critical
orifice.  The exhaust line should be leak tight and piped
to  an  appropriate  exhaust  system.    The  exhaust  line
diameter  should  be  large  enough  to  produce  no  more
than 1 ◊ 10
4
Pa (1.5 psi) pressure drop during purge and
sample flow.
7. 4    Using  the  high  purity  nitrogen  system  shown  in
Figure   1,   purge   the   sampling   system   and   particle
counter   for   at   least   5   minutes   at   the   instrument
manufacturerís  specified  flow  rate.    The  exact  purge
time  should  take  into  account  the  reactivity  of  the  gas
and should be sufficient to purge the entire exhaust line.
A  moisture  sensor  should  be  placed  at  the  system
exhaust  to  verify  less  than  1  ppmv  water  in  the  purge


SEMI F26-0697 © SEMI 1997, 2003 3
nitrogen.    The  purging  must  be  performed  before  toxic
gas  is  introduced  into  the  sampling  system  and  after
completion  of  the  measurement.    The  valve  leading  to
the moisture sensor should be closed when toxic gas is
being  sampled.    The  valve  leading  from  the  purge
nitrogen   system   should   be   closed   when   sampling
specialty  gases  and/or  a  back  flow  prevention  device
should be included in the purge nitrogen system.
NOTE 4:  It  is  known  that  toxic  gases  may  produce  injurious
or  lethal  effects.    Nitrogen  purging  of  the  sampling  system
reduces the risk of exposure to toxic gases.  The purity of the
purge   nitrogen   should   be   sufficient   to   remove   reactive
substances from the sampling system.
7. 5    Count  the  particles  in  each  of  at  least  3  equal
intervals.    Each  sample  interval  must  be  at  least  25
standard liters (0.95 SCF), or 30 minutes, whichever is
greater.    Data  obtained  during  the  first  5  minutes  after
the  sample  valve  is  opened  may  be  discarded.    Record
the  number  of  counts  in  the  sample  volume  for  each
interval.  Calculate
C
X and SC, as defined in Section 4.
NOTE  5:    For  small  volume  specialty  gas  systems,  the  user
and  supplier  may  agree  to  a  smaller  sample  gas  volume  than
that stated above.  The sample point location and the process
line pressure and flow rate during the test should be recorded.

variables defined in Section 4.

R1-1  Introduction
R1-1.1        Isokinetic    sample    probes    are    usually    not
provided in speciality gas systems.  Particle sampling is
usually  performed  using  wall  tap  sample  ports.    Wall
tap  sample  ports  are  oriented  90∞  to  the  process  line
flow as shown in Figure R1-1.  Non-isokinetic flow into
the  sample  tube  results  from  the  90∞  change  in  flow
direction.    Additional  deviation  from  isokinesis  can
result  from  stream  tube  contraction  or  expansion  when
the  velocities  U  and  v  are  not  equal.    The  effects  of
non-isokinetic   flow   on   the   measurement   should   be
checked.    The  particle  sampling  process  should  be
performed with an aspiration efficiency close to 1.

SEMI F27-0997 (Reapproved 1103)
TEST METHOD FOR MOISTURE INTERACTION AND CONTENT OF
GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS BY
ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE IONIZATION MASS SPECTROMETRY
(APIMS)
This test method was technically reapproved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Gases  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North  American  Regional
Standards  Committee  on  September  16,  2003.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  October  2003;  to  be
published November 2003. Originally published September 1997.
1  Purpose
1. 1    This  test  will  determine  the  quantity  of  removable
moisture   and   the   degree   of   interaction   with   trace
concentrations    of    gas    phase    moisture,    of    gas
distribution    systems    and    components.    APIMS    is
currently the technique of choice for such tests because
it is essentially the only commercially available method
capable  of  ppt  moisture  analysis  and  because  of  its
superior   response   time.   This   method   may   provide
guidelines  for  the  application  of  other  techniques  with
similar  detection  limits  and  response  time  to  APIMS
which are not commercially available at this time.
1. 2    The  results  of  this  test  can  be  used  for  qualitative
ranking  of  systems  and  components  and  can  also  be
used,  by  a  sufficiently  sophisticated  user,  as  input  for
numerical simulation of distribution system behavior.
2  Scope
2. 1  System  and  Component  Types  —  This  procedure
applies  to  in-line  components  to  be  used  to  contain
electronics   grade   materials   in   semiconductor   gas
distribution  systems.  The  following  components  are
expected   to   yield   meaningful   results   when   tested
according  to  the  present  method:  tubing,  connectors
(fittings), particle filters, valves (check, relief, shut-off,
and          metering),          regulators,          flow-through
transducers/sensors,  mass  flow  controllers  and  meters.
Components   with   dead   volumes,   such   as   pressure
gauges, can be tested according to this method, but the
results  will  be  difficult  to  interpret.  Additional  criteria
besides those considered here need to be developed for
testing components with dead volumes.
2. 1.1    As  gas  phase  moisture  levels  are  dominated  by
desorption  from  surfaces,  the  procedure  is  expected  to
be  most  useful  for  components  of  large  surface  area
such  as  particle  filters  and  tubing.  Components  with
very  small  wetted  surface  areas  may  have  moisture
interactions  which  are  too  small  to  measure  using  this
test. Check valves and relief valves can be tested only if
their  operating  parameters  are  consistent  with  the  test
conditions.
2. 1.2    Tubing  samples  must  be  rather  long  (3ñ4  m)  to
yield useful results, but they can be bent into a U shape
in order to be accommodated into a practical test bench.
Radii  of  curvature  should  be  no  less  than  6  times  the
internal diameter of the tube and the minimum number
of   bends   should   be   used.   Most   ultra-high   purity
components  are  currently  supplied  with  metal  gasket
connectors, so the test bench employed should be fitted
with  mating  connectors.  This  type  of  fitting  is  usually
welded  to  tubing,  which  is  not  recommended  as  it
introduces a potential source of uncontrolled variability
to the experiments. Instead, a compression fitting on the
tube   and   a   suitable   adapter   should   be   used.   The
compression  fitting  should  not  be  disconnected  after
initial  connection  until  the  test  series  is  over.  In  this
way, deterioration in integrity of the connection can be
avoided. The same type of gasket to compression fitting
adapter should be used for all tubing samples.
2. 1.3    Purifiers  require  special  test  procedures  and  are
not addressed here.
2. 1.4        Simple    systems    consisting    of    components
connected  in  line  can  be  tested  by  the  present  method.
Complex   systems   (i.e.,   those   with   more   than   one
potential  inlet  and/or  outlet)  will  show  performance
which   varies   depending   on   the   test   configuration
(which  inlets  and  outlets  are  chosen).  Testing  of  such
systems is not addressed by the current document.
2. 2  Gases  —  The  procedure  will  be  carried  out  in
nitrogen. The results will provide a ranking with respect
to moisture contribution which may be applied with due
caution  to  components  intended  for  use  in  other  gas
streams. Other ìinertî gases will have different purging
characteristics  and  may  dry  a  component  more  quickly
or  slowly.  Reactive  gases  may  react  chemically  with
moisture.     Considerations     relating     to     corrosion
resistance   are   outside   the   scope   of   the   present
document, although the test procedure may prove useful
in corrosion studies.
2. 3  Operating Situations — Moisture contribution from
a component may be the result of contamination arising
in  its  manufacture,  or  from  subsequent  exposure  to



SEMI F27-0997 © SEMI 1997, 2003 2
ambient  air  or  non-dry  gas.  Thus,  it  is  necessary  to
consider two main situations:

# 1

1.    The    ìinitial    dry-downî    situation,    which    is
determined    by    the    moisture    content    of    the
component    as    received    with    the    effects    of
manufacturing  process  and  design,  surface  quality,
pretreatment and packaging convoluted together.

# 2

2.    The   ìResponse   to   upsetî   situation,   which   is
determined by the amount of moisture taken up by
the  component  and  subsequently  released  in  any
exposure after receipt.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1      This   test   method   allows   the   determination   of
moisture  interactions  which  can  be  used,  for  example,
to  rank  components  in  order  of  decreasing  moisture
interaction.   Because   different   degrees   of   moisture
interaction are desirable in different situations, selecting
the  ìbestî  components  requires  consideration  of  how
they  will  be  used  in  a  given  distribution  system,  either
qualitatively    or    through    numerical    simulation    of
distribution system behavior.

5. 2.2  peak     height     —     the     maximum     moisture
concentration   recorded   when   a   moisture   input   of
predefined  length  and  concentration  is  introduced  to  a
test component.
6  Required Equipment
6. 1  APIMS — The APIMS used for moisture detection
can be of any type. In order to be considered valid, any
series of moisture tests shall reference two single point
calibrations, one at the beginning and one at the end of
the  series.  These  calibrations  shall  both  be  made  under
the  same  analytical  conditions  (flow,  pressures,  plate
voltages, etc.) as the tests and the results shall be within
5%  of  each  other.  Provided  this  condition  is  met,  the
interval   between   calibrations   may   be   left   to   the
discretion of the operator; however, it is suggested that
calibration    should    be    carried    out    whenever    the
equipment   is   moved   and/or   every   two   weeks   of
operation.
6. 2  Dry  Gas  and  Moisture  Generator  —  A  source  of
extremely dry nitrogen (less than 100 ppt moisture) and
a moisture generator capable of delivering up to 13 slm
nitrogen  doped  with  50  ppb  moisture  is  required.    This
generator  may  be  the  same  as  used  to  calibrate  the
APIMS.  The  output  of  the  generator  shall  be  verified
according to SEMI C15.
6. 2.1    Most  ultra-high  purity  components  are  currently
fitted with metal gasket type connectors. The same type
of connector should, therefore, be incorporated into the
test bench for connection to the test components.
6. 3  Test  Blank  —  Any  series  of  tests  shall  include  the
results of testing a blank. The blank shall be the shortest
convenient   length   (no   more   than   1   m)   of   1/4"
electropolished   stainless   steel   (EPSS)   tubing   with
suitable fittings and/or adapters at either end to enable it
to be inserted in place of the test specimen.



SEMI F27-0997 © SEMI 1997, 2003 3
6. 4  Moisture Pulse Generator — A valving arrangement capable of switching rapidly between dry and humidified
nitrogen  is  also  required.  An  example  of  such  a  design  is  shown  in  Figure  1.  In  this  design,  flow  is  maintained  in
both  the  humidified  and  dry  gas  lines  at  all  times.  By  simultaneously  switching  valves  V
1
and  V
3
,  or  V
2
and  V
3
,
either humidified or dry gas is directed through the test specimen while the other gas stream is directed to vent. Note
that  there  is  a  bypass  loop  so  that  flow  can  be  maintained  to  the  APIMS  when  the  specimen  is  removed.  In  this
design,  all  gas  lines,  but  especially  those  lines  between  V
1
and  V
3
and  between  V
2
and  V
3
,  should  be  as  short  as
possible and constructed of EPSS tubing of high quality. Maintaining gas lines at a constant temperature between 50
and 80∞C wherever possible is also recommended.

Figure 1
Moisture Test Schematic

6. 4.1  The bypass loop will contain a stagnant volume of gas during testing. To avoid exposing the APIMS to a large
moisture upset whenever it is fed the gas contained in the bypass loop, the loop should be thoroughly baked out (at ≥
200∞C) and protected from atmospheric contamination thereafter.  Valve V
4
should be such that some flow can be
maintained through the bypass loop and the test specimen simultaneously as well as through each separately.  Use of
pneumatic valves to facilitate rapid and simultaneous switching is recommended.
6. 4.2  Other arrangements than that shown may also be used. The moisture pulse generator should be designed so as
to give the fastest possible response of the blank to a change in input moisture level.
6. 4.3  Use of a glove box or other such enclosure about the test specimen and adjacent piping, to minimize exposure
of  the  system  to  ambient  contamination  when  removing  and  introducing  the  test  specimen,  will  improve  the
precision of moisture content measurements but not of moisture interaction measurements. Use of such an enclosure
is, therefore, left to the discretion of the operator.
6. 5  Temperature  Control  and  Measurement  —  A  stable  temperature  during  the  test  is  of  critical  importance.  The
test   component   shall   be   kept   at   35∞C.   TESTS   AT   DIFFERENT   TEMPERATURES   CANNOT   BE
COMPARED. Ideally, the blank and device under test should be maintained in a temperature-controlled chamber.
However, if this is impractical, heating tape can be used. Temperature shall be measured at 1 m intervals on tubing.
Measurement at one point is adequate for small components. Temperature control should be to ± 1∞C. A continuous
record of temperature during the test shall be maintained.
7  Procedure
7. 1  Blank Tests — A blank test shall be carried out  after each calibration. If initial dry-down testing of components
is not of interest, the initial dry-down test of the test blank may be omitted and the test blank brought to equilibrium
with zero gas in whatever manner is most convenient, except that the test blank should not be heated above 200∞C.
Permanent changes in moisture interaction have been observed at temperatures above this level.



SEMI F27-0997 © SEMI 1997, 2003 4
7. 1.1  Initial Dry Down — Start the experiment with the
blank  in  place  of  the  test  specimen  and  a  flow  of  dry
gas  through  the  APIMS.  The  APIMS  output  should  be
at equilibrium with the lowest moisture level of interest,
and  in  any  case  no  higher  than  500  ppt.  The  flow  rate
through  the  test  blank  should  be  set  according  to  the
Flow Table (see Table 1).
7. 1.1.1    Switch  the  gas  flow  to  pass  primarily  through
the bypass loop while maintaining a small flow through
the  test  blank.  Remove  the  test  blank  completely  from
the  system.  If  a  glove  box  or  other  such  enclosure  is
used, do not remove the test blank from the glove box.
Immediately  reconnect  the  test  blank  to  V
4
,  leaving  it
disconnected  from  V
5
.  Allow  dry  nitrogen  to  flow
through  the  test  blank  for  five  minutes  to  purge  the  air
from inside before reconnecting to V
5
. Switch the gas to
flow only through the blank and not through the bypass
loop.  The  APIMS  will  show  an  increase  in  moisture
concentration.   Record   the   APIMS   output   until   it
reaches 500 ppt or for 24 hours, whichever is less.
7. 1.1.2    Repeat  the  above  test  twice  for  a  total  of  three
data sets.
7. 1.2  Moisture  Input  Test  —  After  the  APIMS  has
returned  to  equilibrium  with  its  initial  moisture  level,
switch  the  input  gas  to  50  ppb  moisture  (by  switching
valves    V
1
,    V
2
,    and    V
3
simultaneously,    if    the
arrangement  of  Figure  1  is  used)  while  recording  the
APIMS  response.  Maintain  this  moisture  input  for  20
minutes.  Switch  the  input  to  the  test  blank  back  to  dry
nitrogen  and  record  the  decease  in  moisture  level  until
the initial background is again reached.
7. 1.2.1    Repeat  the  above  test  twice  for  a  total  of  three
data sets.
7. 2  Tests on Actual Specimen
7. 2.1  Initial  Dry  Down  —  This  portion  of  the  test  is
designed   to   determine   the   quantity   of   removable
moisture  on  the  wetted  surfaces  of  a  component  in  the
condition  in  which  it  is  typically  supplied.  Thus,  the
results   of   this   test   will   reflect,   by   design,   any
precautions  which  the  supplier  has  taken  to  remove
moisture and maintain its dryness during shipping.
7. 2.1.1    Start  the  test  as  in  Section  7.1.1.  The  test
specimen should not be unpacked until after the APIMS
has  equilibrated  with  the  background  moisture  level.  If
a glove box or other such enclosure is used, unpack the
component  in  the  glove  box.  Switch  the  dry  nitrogen
flow to pass through the bypass loop while maintaining
a  small  component  through  the  test  blank.  Undo  the
final layer of packing and any shipping caps or plugs on
the  component  at  this  point.  Remove  the  sample  blank
and connect the test specimen to valve V
4
as quickly as
possible.  Allow  the  dry  nitrogen  flow  to  purge  out  any
ambient  air  in  the  specimen  for  five  minutes,  then
connect the specimen to V
5
. Switch the gas to flow only
through  the  test  specimen  and  not  through  the  bypass
loop.  The  APIMS  will  show  an  increase  in  moisture
concentration.   Record   the   APIMS   output   until   it
reaches 500 ppt or for 24 hours, whichever is less.
7. 2.1.2    After  24  hours,  the  dry-down  part  of  the  test
can  be  terminated.  If  necessary,  the  moisture  level  can
be  reduced  below  500  ppt  by  baking  the  component  at
200∞C  or  the  maximum  temperature  allowed  by  the
manufacturer for six hours and/or purging at the highest
flow  of  dry  gas  available.  If  this  is  not  sufficient  to
reduce  the  moisture  concentration  below  500  ppt,  the
test may be abandoned.
7. 2.2  Moisture  Input  Test  —  After  the  APIMS  has
returned  to  equilibrium  with  its  initial  moisture  level,
switch  the  input  gas  to  50  ppb  moisture  (by  switching
valves    V
1
,    V
2
,    and    V
3
simultaneously,    if    the
arrangement  of  Figure  1  is  used)  while  recording  the
APIMS  response.  Maintain  this  moisture  input  for  20
minutes.  Switch  the  input  to  the  test  blank  back  to  dry
nitrogen  and  record  the  decease  in  moisture  level  until
the initial background is again reached.
7. 2.2.1    Repeat  the  above  test  twice  for  a  total  of  three
data sets.
7. 2.2.2    In  case  the  moisture  level  recorded  by  the
APIMS  does  not  reach  50  ppb  within  20  minutes,  an
additional   test   should   be   performed   in   which   the
moisture input should be continued until equilibrium is
reached.  Then  switch  the  input  to  the  test  specimen
back to dry nitrogen and record the decease in moisture
level  until  the  initial  background  is  again  reached.
This test should be repeated once (two data sets total).
7. 2.3  Bake-Out  Test  —  Heat  component  to  maximum
bake     temperature,     according     to     manufacturerís
specifications,  for  three  hours.  Allow  it  to  return  to
room  temperature.  Continue  by  repeating  the  moisture
input test, after baking, as in Section 7.2.2.
7. 3  Temperature,      Flow      Rate,      and      Pressure
Specification — The recommended test pressure is 700
kPa   (7   bar).   However,   lower   test   pressures   are
appropriate  for  some  models  of  APIMS.  Also,  the
maximum pressure rating of the test components should
not  be  exceeded.  The  component  temperature  shall  be
maintained at 35 ± 1∞C during the test.
7. 3.1  In the case of tubing, the test shall be carried out
at  a  single  flow  determined  by  the  tubing  diameter
according  to  the  following  table.  In  the  case  of  valves,
regulators,  mass  flow  controllers  (MFCís),  and  passive
components (gauges, flow meters, and fittings), the test
will  be  carried  out  at  a  single  flow  determined  by  the
table according to the size of the connecting tube stubs.



SEMI F27-0997 © SEMI 1997, 2003 5
Regulators  should  be  tested  in  the  fully-open  condition
(i.e.,  with  the  regulator  adjusted  for  minimum  pressure
drop).  The  quantity  of  published  data  on  regulator
interaction with moisture is limited, and experiments to
investigate  the  effect  of  varying  the  pressure  drop
across  the  regulator  are  encouraged  but  are  not  part  of
this  test.  MFCís  should  be  tested  with  a  flow  control
device  upstream  and  the  MFC  not  actively  controlling
the  flow  through  it  (usually  referred  to  as  the  ìpurgeî
setting).  It  may  not  be  possible  to  test  a  given  MFC  at
the specified flow if the flow rating of the MFC is much
less than the specified flow. As MFCís are not expected
to  vary  greatly  in  performance  according  to  their  flow
rating,  MFCís  to  be  tested  should  generally  be  chosen
to  be  compatible  with  the  table.  If  this  is  not  possible,
then  the  MFC  should  be  tested  at  its  rated  flow  (lower
than the flow in the table). This can then be considered
a conservative test, as the MFC operated at higher flow
would be expected to dry down more quickly.
7. 3.2        Particle    filters    with    the    same    size    tubing
connectors  often  have  somewhat  different  sizes  and
very different flow ratings. In order to be able to make
reasonable  comparisons  between  the  performance  of
different  filters,  it  is  essential  to  test  filters  of  similiar
size at the same flow. However, the flow dependence of
the   moisture   response   of   particle   filters   is   more
complex than that of tubing, and they must be tested at
more than one flow in order to model their behavior. In
order  to  meet  this  requirement  and  provide  data  which
can  be  readily  compared  with  the  conditions  under
which the filters can be expected to be used in practice,
filters shall be tested at two flows: The first, according
to  the  size  of  the  connecting  tube  stubs,  the  second,  to
be  25%  of  the  rated  flow  of  the  filter  or  50  slm,
whichever is less.
7. 3.3    For  systems  of  components,  the  system  shall  be
tested  at  the  lowest  flow  of  those  determined  for  each
component  in  the  system  considered  separately.  If  the
system  includes  a  filter,  it  shall  be  tested  at  that  flow
and additionally, at 25% of the rated flow of the filter or
50 slm, whichever is less.

TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING PARTICLE GENERATION FROM
PROCESS PANELS
This test method was technically approved by the Global GasesCommittee and is the direct responsibility of
the North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards
Committee  on  September  25,  2003.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  October  2003;  to  be  published
November 2003. Originally published September 1997.
1  Purpose
1. 1  The purpose of this document is to define a method
for  testing  process  panels  intended  for  installation  in
high-purity gas distribution systems. Application of this
test method is expected to yield comparable data among
process  panels  tested  for  the  purposes  of  qualification
for this installation.
1. 2  This document describes a test method designed to
draw      comparisons      of      particulate      generation
performance   of   process   panels.   This   test   method
evaluates  the  cleanliness  of  process  panels  in  the  ìas
receivedî  condition  as  well  as  under  normal  operating
conditions. The ìas receivedî test is intended to enable
the   user   to   evaluate   the   fabrication,   cleaning,   and
packaging   techniques   of   the   manufacturer   of   the
process    panel.    The    test    under    actual    operating
conditions  is  intended  to  allow  the  user  to  evaluate  the
manufacturerís   component   selection   as   well   as   the
quality  of  the  panel  design.  The  specific  flow  rates
described  in  both  test  methods  are  representative  of
relatively  high  flow  conditions  for  a  typical  process
panel.
2  Scope
2. 1    This  test  method  addresses  total  particle  counts
greater than the minimum detection limit (MDL) of the
particle  counter  and  does  not  consider  classifying  data
into various size ranges.
2. 2  This procedure utilizes a particle counter applied to
process    panels    typically    used    in    semiconductor
applications.  It  applies  to  process  gas  supply  systems
(e.g.,  gas  cabinets)  which  include  a  process  panel,  an
inert  purge  panel,  and  a  system  vent.  Both  automatic
and  manual  process  panels  are  within  the  scope  of  this
test  procedure.  Panels,  as  defined  in  this  test  method,
are considered to consist of 6.35 mm O. D. × 0.89 mm
wall (1/4" O.D. × 0.035" wall) tubing and components.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1    This  test  method  specifies  flow  and  mechanical
stress conditions considered typical of conditions which
would    be    expected    under    moderately    aggressive
operating   conditions.   These   conditions   should   not
exceed   those   recommended   by   the   manufacturer.
Actual performance under operating conditions at lower
flow rates or less aggressive conditions may differ. This
test  method  does  not  address  particle  generation  under
vibrating conditions.
3. 2    The  test  medium  is  limited  to  nitrogen,  argon,  or
clean dry air (CDA). Performance with other gases may
differ.
3. 3  The accuracy of the data generated by this method
is  limited  to  the  accuracy  of  the  particle  measuring
instruments utilized.
3. 4  This method is written with the assumption that the
operator understands the use of the apparatus at a level
equivalent to six months of experience.
3. 5    This  document  is  not  intended  as  a  methodology
for monitoring on-going particulate performance once a
particular  process  panel  has  been  tested.  Also,  this
method  does  not  include  extended  dynamic  particle
count  testing  (particle  generation  after  thousands  of
cycles).
3. 6   Auto-crossover systems are not within the scope of
this test procedure.
NOTE 1:  It should be mentioned that test results from panels
equipped with final outlet filters can differ significantly from
test results from panels without filters.

6. 2.2  Filters    ó    Filters    are    required    to    provide
ìparticle-freeî  test  gas.  Each  filter  must  be  nine-log
retentive, per manufacturerís specifications, to 0.02 μm
particles  and  have  a  pressure  drop  of  less  than  6.9  kPa
(1 psid) at the specified test pressure and flow rate. The
filter must be capable of achieving less than 1 particle
3

(≥  0.02  μm)  per  cubic  foot  of  test  gas  under  test
conditions.
6. 2.3  Pressure  Regulator  ó  Pressure  regulators  are
required to maintain system test pressures.
6. 2.4  Pressure   Gauge   ó   Pressure   transducers   or
gauges are required to monitor system test pressures.
6. 2.5  Flow  Control  Device  ó  A  0ñ100  slpm  flow
control  device  is  required  for  controlling  the  test  flow
rate.
6. 2.6  Tubing ó A 6.35 mm O.D. × 0.89 mm wall (1/4"
O.D. ×  0.035"  wall)  tubing  is  required.    The  tubing
shall   have   an   average   surface   roughness   of   0.25
micrometer  (10  microinch)  Ra  or  less.  Electropolished
tubing (as defined in SEMI F16) is recommended.
6. 2.7  Sampler ó  The  sampling  system  consists  of  a
diffuser equipped with a pressure reducing device (e.g.,
critical  orifice)  and  a  sample  probe.  All  parts  of  the
sampling   system   are   to   be   electropolished   with   a
surface  roughness  of  0.25  micrometer  (10  microinch)
Ra or less. If a critical orifice is to be used for pressure
reduction,  it  is  not  required  to  be  electropolished.  The
diffuser  and  sample  probe  must  be  sized  to  obtain
isokinetic sampling at the specified test conditions. The
critical  orifice  must  be  sized  to  obtain  the  specified
panel pressure at the specified test flow rate.
6. 2.8  Spool  Piece  ó  Spool  pieces  shall  be  electro-
polished  316L  stainless  steel  tubing  with  a  surface
finish  of  0.25  micrometer  (10  microinch)  Ra  or  better.
The spool piece is to be installed in the system in place
of  the  test  device  while  obtaining  background  counts
for the system.
6. 2.9  Fittings    ó    Use    face    seal    connectors    or
compression   fittings   depending   on   test   panel   end
connections.
6. 2.10  Gaskets ó Use non-plated metal gaskets where
required.
6. 2.11  A CNC capable of detecting particles at least as
small  as  0.02  μm  at  a  50%  efficiency  envelope  as
defined  by  ISO  14644,  with  a  sampling  flow  rate  of
1. 23  SLPM  (0.05  scfm)  or  greater,  is  to  be  used  for
particle  counting.  A  laser  particle  counter,  capable  of
detecting particles at least as small as 0.1 micro meters,
may  be  used  in  addition  to,  or  in  place  of,  the  CNC.
Test durations in this test method have been established
based  on  a  sampling  flow  rate  of  1.23  SLPM  (0.05
scfm).
6. 2.11.1      Instruments   should   be   calibrated   regularly,
according  to  manufacturerís  recommendations.  For  the
CNC,  this  includes  routine  checks  of  sample  flow  rate,
working fluid level, and zero.
6. 2.11.2      The   CNC   and   data   collection   equipment
should have power surge suppression.
6. 2.11.3  Setup and Schematic ó See Figure 1.

Panel Test Apparatus
6. 2.11.4    The  spool  piece  is  to  be  installed  when  the  test  stand  is  not  in  use.  A  continuous  low  flow  is  to  be
maintained  to  purge  the  system.  The  particle  counter  may  be  turned  off.  For  an  extended  shutdown,  the  system
(excluding the CNC) should be pressurized and capped.
6. 2.11.5    After  initial  construction,  the  spool  piece  should  be  installed  and  the  system  should  be  cleaned  up  by
running a high-flow rate of test gas (> 60 SLPM) and gently tapping all components (except the CNC) downstream
of the final filter. This procedure should be followed by a start-up phase which characterizes system cleanliness by
conducting the entire test protocol with the spool piece installed.
6. 3  Test Procedures
NOTE  2:    Ensure  the  counter  is  counting  continuously  and  reporting  data  each  minute.  For  the  duration  of  the  test,  the  counter
should be continuously counting, except where noted in the test protocol.
6. 3.1    This  test  method  classifies  panels  into  three  pressure  ranges:  high,  medium,  and  low.  The  test  pressures  and
flow rates for each pressure classification are given in Table 1 below.

6. 3.1.1  The test flow rates stated in the above table are
meant  to  serve  as  a  general  guideline.  The  actual  test
flow  rates  may  vary  depending  on  the  maximum  panel
flow  rate  as  recommended  by  the  manufacturer.  The
maximum  test  flow  rate  should  be  the  manufacturerís
maximum    recommended    flow    rate.    If    no    such
maximum    flow    rate    is    recommended    by    the
manufacturer,  the  flow  rates  in  the  above  table  should
be used.
6. 3.2  Background   Test   ó   Ensure   that   all   valves
depicted in Figure 1 are in the closed position. Connect
the  spool  piece  to  the  purge  gas  inlet  (C-2)  and  the
isokinetic sampler inlet. Ensure that the spool piece and
proper adapters are in place on the test apparatus. (C-1
should be capped at this time.)
6. 3.2.1    Close  valve  V-3.  Adjust  the  regulator  (PCV-2)
until PI-5 indicates the appropriate pressure in Table 1.
Open valve V-3 and use FC-2 to establish the specified
test  flow  rate  listed  in  Table  1.  Measure  the  static
background  count.  Background  count  is  established
when  the  counter  has  sampled  a  minimum  of  74  SL  (3
scf), and the arithmetic average during the last 74 SL (3
scf)   of   gas   sampled   is   <   71   particles/m
3
(<   2
particles/scf).  At  a  sample  flow  rate  of  1.23  SLPM
(0.05  scfm),  the  time  required  is  one  hour.  Ensure  that
the   background   counts   are   stable  or  decreasing.  If
background  cannot  be  achieved  after  147  SL  (6  scf)
have  been  sampled,  there  may  be  a  problem  with  the
counter or test apparatus.
6. 3.2.2      Disconnect   the   spool   piece   from   C-2   and
connect it to C-1. Cap C-2 at this point.
6. 3.2.3  Open valve V-1 and close valve V-2. Adjust the
regulator  (PCV-1)  until  PI-2  indicates  the  appropriate
supply pressure listed in Table 1. Open valves V-1 and
V-2  to  establish  flow.  Using  the  flow  control  device
(FC-1)  set  the  appropriate  test  flow  rate  listed  in  Table
1.  Measure  the  static  background  count.  Background
count  is  established  when  the  counter  has  sampled  a
minimum  of  74  SL  (3  scf),  and  the  arithmetic  average
during  the  last  74  SL  (3  scf)  of  gas  sampled  is  <  71
particles/m3 (< 2 particles/scf). At a sample flow rate of
1. 23  SLPM  (0.05  scfm),  the  time  required  is  one  hour.
Ensure   that   the   background   counts   are   stable   or
decreasing. If background cannot be achieved after 147
SL (6 scf) have been sampled, there may be a problem
with the counter or test apparatus.
6. 3.2.4    Actuate  valve  V-2  at  1  cycle  per  minute  to
measure  the  background  counts  under  dynamic  test
conditions.  Dynamic  background  count  is  established
when  the  counter  has  sampled  a  minimum  of  74  SL  (3
scf), and the arithmetic average during the last 74 SL (3
scf)   of   gas   sampled   is   <   106   particles/m
3
(<   3
particles/scf).  At  a  sample  flow  rate  of  1.23  SLPM
(0.05  scfm),  the  time  required  is  1  hour.  If  dynamic
background  cannot  be  achieved  after  147  SL  (6  scf)
have  been  sampled,  there  may  be  a  problem  with  the
counter or test apparatus.
6. 3.3  Static Test ó Using the flow control device (FC-
1),  decrease  the  flow  rate  to  2.5ñ5.0  SLPM  (0.1ñ0.2
scfm),  so  that  some  flow  remains  in  the  system  while
the test component is installed.
6. 3.3.1    Remove  the  spool  piece  by  first  disconnecting
the  downstream  fitting  and  then  the  upstream  fitting.
Immediately install the test panel with all of the process
valves in the fully-open position by first connecting the
process  gas  inlet  (C-3)  fitting  and  then  the  process
outlet fitting. Uncap C-2 and connect it to the purge gas
inlet  (C-4)  connection  of  the  panel  with  V-3  in  the
closed  condition.  In  order  to  minimize  atmospheric
contamination and prevent the counter from cooling off,
removal  of  the  spool  piece  and  installation  of  the  test
panel  should  take  no  longer  than  2  minutes.  Extreme
care  should  be  taken  to  minimize  contamination  of  the
test apparatus during this operation. The test panel is to
be  removed  from  its  inner  bag  in  the  Class  100  test
area.  If  the  process  outlet  connection  of  the  test  panel
has mechanical fittings, these fittings are to be properly
connected.  If  the  process  outlet  has  butt  weld  tube
stubs,   the   connection   is   to   be   made   with   clean
compression  fittings.  Do  not  permanently  crimp  any
ferrules   onto   the   tube   stubs.   Nylon   ferrules   are
acceptable. The purge gas inlet connection (C-4) should
also   be   connected   at   this   time.   The   outlet   vent
connection   should   be   capped   at   this   time.   If   this
connection is not capped by the manufacturer, it should
be covered with Aclar or Nylon 66 squares and taped so
as  to  insure  against  contamination  by  the  immediate
environment. If applicable, all pneumatic valves should
be   connected   using   the   maximum   recommended
actuator pressure as specified by the manufacturer.
6. 3.3.2    Adjust  the  panelís  process  regulator  to  obtain
the  appropriate  process  outlet  pressure  as  indicated  in
Table 1. Using the flow control device (FC-1), increase
the  flow  to  obtain  the  appropriate  test  flow  rate  as
indicated in Section 6.3.1.1
6. 3.3.3    Turn  on  the  counter  and  conduct  the  steady
state  test.  All  of  the  valves  on  the  process  panel  are  to
be tested in a fully-open position until 74 SL (3 scf) of
gas  have  been  sampled.  Cumulative  data  should  be
recorded at one-minute intervals.
NOTE  3:    The  flow  rates  in  Table  1  represent  the  maximum
test  flow  rates.  If  a  more  thorough  test  is  desired,  the  static
portion  of  the  test  should  be  repeated  at  intervals  of  20%,
40%,  60%,  and  80%  of  the  full  test  flow  rate.  Testing  at  the
lower flow rates may in some instances be more indicative of
panel performance under actual use conditions.



SEMI F28-1103 © SEMI 1997, 2003 6
6. 3.4  Dynamic  Test  ó  This  test  is  to  immediately
follow  the  static  test.  To  conduct  the  dynamic  test,
actuate the panelís final process outlet valve at the rate
of 1 cycle/minute for 60 minutes. Each cycle consists of
having  the  valve  in  the  open  position  for  58  seconds
and in the closed position for 2 seconds.
6. 3.5  Cylinder  Change  Test  ó  Close  V-2,  open  V-3
and V-4, and adjust PCV-2 until PI-5 reads 3450 Kpag
(500  psig).  Adjust  the  flow  rate  and  pressure  to  the
vacuum  venturi  using  FC-3  and  PCV-3.  The  flow  rate
and   pressure   should   be   set   to   the   manufacturerís
recommended    values.    Next    perform    a    simulated
cylinder    change    purge    and    evacuation    sequence
following  the  valve  sequencing,  dwell  times,  pressure
settings, etc. as specified by the manufacturer.
6. 3.6  Final  Steady  State  Test  ó  Close  V-4,  V-3,  and
open V-2. Repeat the step in Section 6.3.3.3.
6. 3.7  Unregulated  Flow  Test  (optional)  ó  In  some
instances,  it  may  be  desirable  to  test  the  panel  with  its
regulator  in  the  fully-open  position.  Such  a  test  will
give  an  indication  of  panel  particulate  performance
without the additional contribution of particles from an
operating  regulator.  In  this  instance,  steps  6.3ñ6.3.5
should  be  repeated  with  the  regulator  in  the  wide  open
condition.
6. 4  Data Analysis and Reporting ó The following test
conditions are to be reported in the data presentation:
1. Date and time of test
2. Operator

# 3

3. Test flow rate
4. Test pressures

6. 4.1  Data   Presentation   ó   Graph   the   static   and
dynamic portions of the test separately as counts/minute
(measured  by  the  counter)  versus  time,  including  the
appropriate background (measured with the spool piece
in  place)  with  each.  Also  graph  the  entire  data  set  as
counts per minute versus time.
6. 4.1.1  Present the entire raw data set in tabular form.
6. 4.2  Data  Reduction  ó  The  statistical  analysis  is
based on the assumption that the particles generated are
randomly  distributed  and  are  statistically  independent
of  each  other.  The  background  counts  are  independent
of  the  particle  performance  of  the  component.  The
particle   counts   observed   from   the   test   include   the
counts  from  the  component  and  the  background  count.
Let:
X
B
=
average background  particle  count
X
t
=
average  total  particle  count   from  test
X
c
=
average  particle  count  generated  by  the  test  component

Therefore,
X
t=X
c+X

6. 4.2.1  A statistical analysis of the data is performed to
determine   the   mean,   standard   deviation,   and   the
standard error for each particle size range.
6. 4.2.2  The sample mean, X, or average of the data for
each state is given by:
X=
X
i
n
i=1
n
∑

where X
i
is the observed counts for the state and n is the
number of samples.
6. 4.2.3    The  sample  standard  deviation  is  a  measure  of
the variability of the data about the mean. The standard
deviation, s, for each state is expressed as:
s=
(Xi−X
)
2
i=1
n
∑
n−1

6. 4.2.4    The  standard  error,  Se  or  standard  deviation  of
the  sampling  distribution  of  the  mean  for  each  state  is
given below:
Se=
s
n

6. 4.2.5  The average particle count for the total number
of   particles   generated,   or   the   sample   mean,   is   an
estimation   of   the   population   mean.   For   a   95%
confidence   level,   the   population   mean,   μ
p
,  will  be
within two standard errors of the sample mean, or:
μ
p
=X
±2 Se




SEMI F28-1103 © SEMI 1997, 2003 7
6. 4.2.6      In   order   to   determine   if   there   is   statistical
evidence  of  the  component  having  an  effect  on  the
observed particle count, a test must be conducted to see
if the actual difference between the average background
count, X
B
,  and  the  average  test  count,  X
t
,  exceeds  two
standard  errors  in  a  distribution  of  differences  between
means. The average particle count generated by the test
component, X
c
, is given by:
X
c=X
t−X
B

6. 4.2.7        The    standard    error    in    a    distribution    of
differences between means is expressed as:
S
ec
=S
et
2
+ S
eB
2

6. 4.2.8      The   95%   confidence   interval   of   the   test
component itself is then determined by:
X
c±  2  S
ec

6. 4.2.9    If  this  confidence  interval  includes  0,  then  this
implies  that  there  is  not  strong  statistical  evidence  of
the component having an effect on the observed particle
count.  If  this  interval  does  not  include  0,  then  this
implies  there  is  strong  statistical  evidence  that  the
component does have an effect on the observed particle
count.
6. 4.2.10    Present  in  tabular  form  the  average  particle
count  and  the  associated  upper  and  lower  confidence
limits (as calculated in Section 6.4.2) for each test state.
In addition, present the background test data separately
as a distinct element.

SEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103)
TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM
PANELS
This test method was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility of
the North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards
Committee  on  September  3,  2003.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  September  2003;  to  be  published
November 2003. Originally published September 1997.
1  Purpose
1. 1      This   document   defines   the   purge   efficacy   test
method  recommended  for  determining  the  minimum
acceptable   level   of   purge   efficacy   for   gas   source
systems used in semiconductor manufacturing. It is also
intended  as  an  aid  to  the  procurement  of  gas  source
equipment.
NOTE 1:  Users of this specification are encouraged to submit
suggested revisions or other comments to SEMI.
2  Scope
2. 1    This  specification  applies  to  gas  source  equipment
used   in   semiconductor   manufacturing   facilities   and
comparable research and development areas. It includes
contamination   testing   requirements   for   gas   source
systems.
2. 2  The tests covered by this document are as follows:
2. 2.1    Purge  efficacy  with  a  non-interactive  gas  using
manufacturers’ standard purge sequence.
2. 2.2    Purge  efficacy  with  a  non-interactive  gas  using
the test method specified purge sequence.
2. 2.3      Purge   efficacy   with   an   interactive   gas   using
manufacturers’ standard purge sequence.
2. 2.4    Purge  efficacy  with  an  interactive  gas  using  the
test method specified purge sequence.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  The document is not intended to determine the safe
operation  of  a  gas  source  system.  The  test  method
described  here  is  for  determining  the  removal  efficacy
of  hazardous  gas  from  the  pigtail  portion  of  the  gas
panel  during  routine  cylinder  change  operations  (pre-
purge). It does not address the purge condition after the
change of the cylinder (post-purge) nor the purge of the
entire  gas  source  system  which  is  usually  performed
following  its  initial  installation  or  during  maintenance
(maintenance purge).
3. 2  Because the response time of moisture and oxygen
analyzers   utilizing   different   technologies   can   differ
significantly,   this   can   lead   to   the   possibility   that
different  instruments  will  report  different  peak  heights
when     measuring     identical     contaminant     spikes.
Therefore,  results  of  tests  should  only  be  compared
when similar analyzers are used.

gas delivery or distribution system, often accomplished
by   flowing   a   stream   of   high   purity   dry   inert   gas
continuously through the system for an extended period
of time.
5. 2.3  dwell  time  —  the  time  for  which  vacuum  or
pressure    is    applied    during    the    evacuation    or
pressurization steps of a purge operation.
5. 2.4  interactive gas — a gas that will readily adsorb to
the  surface  of  a  vessel  used  to  contain  or  transport  it.
Examples  of  interactive  gases  are  hydrogen  chloride
and moisture.
5. 2.5  non-interactive  gas  —  a  gas  that  will  not  adsorb
to the surface of a vessel used to contain or transport it.
Examples   of   non-interactive   gases   are   oxygen   and
nitrogen.
5. 2.6  pigtail — the pigtail is the part of the gas source
equipment  that  is  the  flexible  connection  between  the
cylinder and the gas panel.

of  purge  gas  from  the  pigtail  to  minimize  atmospheric
intrusion into the gas panel.
5. 2.8  purge  cycle  —  following  the  initial  process  vent
step, a cycle is defined as a pressurization step followed
by an evacuation step.
5. 2.9  purified nitrogen — nitrogen purified to meet the
following characteristics:

9  Procedure
9. 1    Purge  efficacy  determination  with  non-interactive
gas  at  manufacturer’s  recommended  pressure,  vacuum,
and dwell times.
9. 1.1  Connect gas source equipment as in Figure 1.
NOTE  2:    To  avoid  biasing  the  test  results  by  substantially
increasing   piping   volume   to   be   purged,   the   dead   space
between  the  cylinder  connection  and  the  valves  isolating  the
analyzer and the contaminant source must be small compared
to  the  total  pigtail  volume.  The  use  of  mono-block  valve  and
flow-through      type      pressure      transducer      is      highly
recommended.
9. 1.1.1      However,   the   pigtail   is   connected   to   the
cylinder  valve  during  the  purge  in  an  actual  cylinder
change  operation.  The  small  additional  volume  to  be
purged in the test setup may be used to account for the
volume  of  the  cylinder  valve  outlet  cavity,  which  must
be purged during a cylinder change.
9. 1.2      To   challenge   the   gas   panel   with   a   known
contaminant  gas,  completely  fill  and  pressurize  the  gas
source system to 207 kPa (g) [30 psi (g)] with CDA as
measured at the pigtail with the pressure transducer.
9. 1.3      Using   purified   nitrogen   as   the   purge   gas,
complete   one   purge   cycle   at   the   manufacturer’s
recommended pressure, vacuum, and dwell times.
9. 1.4    Flow  purified  nitrogen  using  a  pigtail  bleed  at  1
slpm    or    at    the    oxygen    analyzer    manufacturer’s
recommended  flow  rate,  whichever  is  higher,  into  the
oxygen  analyzer  for  10  minutes  or  until  below  the
detection limit of the oxygen analyzer.

9. 1.5  Record the pressure and peak oxygen concentration in Table 1. It is highly recommended that, in addition to
the  peak  oxygen  concentration,  the  oxygen  concentration  readings  also  be  recorded  at  regular  intervals  during  the
measurement, so that a graph of the oxygen concentration level in the pigtail bleed gas versus time can be drawn if
necessary.
9. 1.6    Repeat  Sections  9.1.2–9.1.5  for  2,  5,  25,  and  50  purge  cycles  at  the  manufacturer’s  recommended  pressure,
vacuum and dwell times. Additional tests using other purge cycle numbers are encouraged and may provide a more
complete characterization of the purge performance of the test piece.
9. 1.7    Plot  the  peak  residual  oxygen  concentration  versus  cycles  as  in  Figure  2  for  manufacturer’s  recommended
pressure, vacuum, and dwell times.
9. 2  Purge efficacy determination with non-interactive gas at standard pressure, vacuum and dwell times.
9. 2.1  Connect the gas source equipment as in Figure 1.

9. 2.2    To  challenge  the  gas  panel  with  a  known  contaminant  gas,  completely  fill  and  pressurize  the  gas  source
system to 207 kPa (g) [30 psi (g)] with CDA as measured at the pigtail with the pressure transducer.
