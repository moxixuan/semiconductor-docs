be  acceptable,  choose  sampling  points  for  acceptor,
donor,  and  carbon  sample  wafers.    Cut  the  sample
wafers  at  the  proper  points,  then  analyze  for  acceptor
and  donor  content  by  SEMI  MF1389  and/or  SEMI
MF1630, and for carbon by SEMI MF1391.  Cut wafers
about 2-mm thick from the ingot for these analyses and
prepare  the  samples  in  accordance  with  the  method
being    used.        Choose    the    ingot    sampling    plan
appropriate   to   the   type   of   core   being   sampled   in
accordance  with  the  procedure  in  Sections  12.6.2  or
12. 6.3 as appropriate.
12. 6.2  Parallel   Cores   —   For   parallel   cores   (see
Section 10.2.1), single crystal ingot size is about 10 mm
diameter  by  about  200  mm  in  length.    Select  the
sampling points according to the individual segregation
coefficients  for  the  specific  impurities  so  these  are
representative   of   more   than   90%   of   the   impurity
concentration as follows:
12. 6.2.1  Segregation  Effects  —  During  the  growth  of
the  crystal,  crystallization  from  the  melt,  the  impurity
concentration in the solid phase is different from that of
the  liquid  phase  due  to  segregation.
1,2
The  different
impurities    have    different    segregation    coefficients,
defined as:
l
s
C
C
K=
0
(1)
where:
K
0
= equilibrium segregation coefficient,
C
s
=  concentration  of  the  impurity  in  the  solid  phase,  in
atoms/cm
3
, and
C
l
= concentration of the impurity in the liquid phase, in
atoms/cm
3
.
12. 6.2.2  Do    not    use    the    equilibrium    segregation
coefficient  for  calculations  since  it  is  applicable  only
for  solidification  at  a  negligibly  slow  growth  rate.    For
higher   solidification   rates,   the   impurity   atoms   are
rejected  by  the  advancing  melt  at  a  greater  rate  than
they  can  diffuse  into  the  melt.    The  impurity  atoms
accumulate  in  the  melt  layer  near  the  growth  interface,
developing  an  impurity  concentration  gradient.    The
concentration  of  this  gradient  depends  on  the  growth
rate,  fluid  flow  in  the  melt,  and  diffusion  behavior  of
the dopant.  An effective segregation coefficient, K
eff
, is
described as:</p><p>)/exp()1(
00
0
DVKK
K
K
eff</p><h1>δ−−+</h1><p>(2)
where:
V     =   the growth rate, in cm/s,
δ
=   the diffusion layer thickness, in cm, and
D     =   the  diffusion  coefficient  of  the  impurity  in  the
melt, in cm
2
/s.
12. 6.2.3  In   practice,   measure   a   doping   profile   to
determine  the  concentrations  of  impurities  along  the
length  of  the  ingot.    The  zone  length,  shown  in  Figure
3,  is  dependent  on  sample  diameter,  coil  design,  and
pull rate.  After initial determination of the zone length,
re-measure  it  only  after  changes  occur  in  the  method
and  apparatus.    The  doping  profile,  measured  for  each
impurity,  determines  where  the  ingot  should  be  cut  to
provide accurate impurity values.  Sample points should
be chosen to be representative of more than 90% of the
impurity concentration.  In Figure 3, the zone length is
measured at 15 mm.  If the doping profile indicates that
the flat portion of the curve is at 12-zone lengths for an
impurity,  take  the  sample  at  12-zone  lengths  (12  ×  15
mm  =  180  mm)  from  the  start  of  solidification  on  the
ingot.
Figure 3
Zone Length Measurement and Ingot Sampling
Point</p><ol start="12"><li>6.2.4  Ingot  Profiling—  For  the  type  of  float  zone
furnace,  coil  design,  pull  rates,  and  ingot/core  sample
diameter  used,  the  effective  segregation  coefficient  for
the  impurities  can  vary.    To  calibrate  the  individual
zoner   parameters   and   technique   used,   measure   the
actual  segregation  coefficient  profile.    For  example,  to
determine  the  carbon  profile,  cut  an  ingot  into  wafers
along its length, and measure the carbon content in each
of   the   wafers.      Then   make   a   plot   of   carbon
concentration as a function of zone length.  The number</li></ol><p>SEMI MF1723-1104 © SEMI 2004 8
of zone lengths required to reach the flat portion of the
axial  concentration  profile  determines  the  length  of
ingot that must be grown to achieve an accurate carbon
value.    Figure  4  shows  an  axial  doping  profile  for
carbon where a 20-mm diameter sample core was zoned
to  a  10-mm  diameter  ingot  with  a  zone  length  of  15
mm.    The  effective  segregation  coefficient  was  0.175.
In  this  case,  growing  the  ingot  to  a  zone  length  of  12
ensures  that  the  maximum  amount  of  carbon  has  been
incorporated  into  the  ingot.    Sampling  the  ingot  for
carbon at a zone length of 12 gives reproducible carbon
values  that  accurately  reflect  the  amount  of  carbon  in
the polysilicon sample.
12. 6.2.5  Slice  Locations  —  Once  the  concentration
gradient  for  each  element  for   the   individual   zoner
conditions  is  established,  establish  sampling  rules  for
each   element.      Boron,   with   a   high   segregation
coefficient,  has  a  relatively  flat  profile.    A  wafer  taken
from  the  ingot  at  6  zone  lengths  has  a  value  nearly
equal  to  that  taken  at  12  zone  lengths.    If  one  value  is
significantly higher than the other, a contamination has
probably occurred, and the analysis should be repeated.
Phosphorus,  with  a  smaller  segregation  coefficient,  has
different  values  at  the  6-  and  12-zone  length  points.
The  midpoint  should  have  a  value  about  10  to  15%
lower  than  the  end  point.    If  not,  contamination  is
indicated and the analysis should be repeated.  Carbon,
with a very small segregation coefficient, varies greatly
between  the  6-  and  12-zone  length  points.    If  not,
contamination  is  indicated  and  the  analysis  should  be
repeated.    Carbon  value  at  the  maximum  ingot  length
should be reported.
12. 6.3  Perpendicular Cores — For perpendicular cores
(see  Section  10.2.2),  single  crystal  ingot  size  is  about
14-mm  diameter  with  a  length  determined  by  the  poly
rod   diameter,   about   100   mm.      For   these   ingots,
sampling  for  acceptor-donor  content  is  different  than
the   carbon   sampling,   due   to   the   small   segregation
coefficient  for  carbon.    Sampling  points  are  selected
according to the following:
12. 6.3.1  Resistivity     Profile     —     Determine     the
distribution   of   acceptor/donor   impurities   along   the
length of the ingot by plotting a resistivity profile of the
ingot  at  10-mm  intervals,  in  accordance  with  SEMI
MF397.    Also  profile  conductivity  type,  in  accordance
with  SEMI  MF42,  at  10-mm  intervals.    Due  to  the
segregation   effects   discussed   in   Section   12.6.2.1,
characteristic    purity    of    the    filament,    and    other
interferences   discussed   in   Section   3,   the   resistivity
profile  will  differ  between  laboratories.    A  typical
resistivity/type profile is established after repeated runs
on control rods and production samples.  Significant in
the  resistivity  profile  indicates  point  contamination  or
nonuniformity of the deposition layer.
12. 6.3.2  Slice  Locations  —  Establish  sampling  rules
for  each  element  based  on  the  resistivity/type  profile.
The  single  crystal  ingot  length  is  correlated  to  the
polysilicon    rod    diameter;    take    a    slice    at    the
representative  midpoint  between  the  filament  and  the
outer  skin  of  the  polysilicon  rod.    Analyze  this  wafer
for  acceptor/donor  values  in  accordance  with  SEMI
MF1389  or  SEMI  MF1630.    For  the  cross  section  of  a
polysilicon rod, these values represent the R/2 location.
If  the  resistivity/type  profile  has  significant  variation
from   the   standard   profile,   other   locations   may   be
sampled to determine the distribution of each impurity.
Repeat the analysis for ingots with significant variation
suggesting point contamination.</p><p>Figure 4

values  can  not  be  obtained  on  short  ingot  lengths,

filament location.  If desired, sample other locations for
measurement of radial distribution.</li></ol><p>6 Hwang, L.  L., Bucci, J., McCormick, J.  R., “Measurement of Car-

13  Calculation
13. 1  After  measurement  of  the  acceptor,  donor,  and
carbon  impurities  in  the  cut  wafers,  relate  these  values
to the levels in the polysilicon by making the following
calculations.
13. 2  Parallel Cores — For sampling parallel cores (see
Section  10.2.1)  in  cases  where  the  filament  may  be
doped   or   have   a   different   composition   than   the
deposition  layer,  make  the  following  calculation  in
order to determine values for the total rod product:

13. 2.1
This  calculation  assumes  that  the  deposition
layer  is  uniform  across  the  diameter  of  the  polysilicon
rod.    Verify  this  assumption  by  taking  sufficient  core
samples to cover the entire deposition layer.
13. 3
Perpendicular      Cores      —      For      sampling
perpendicular  cores  (see  Section  10.2.2)  where  ingots
have   been   grown   as   in   Section   12.6.3,   make   the
following  calculation  in  order  to  determine  values  for
the total rod product.
13. 3.1
Correlate  the  single  crystal  ingot  length  to  the
polysilicon  rod  cross  section  as  shown  in  Figure  5.    A
zone  length  is  related  to  a  cross  section  area.    Boron,
with a large segregation coefficient, is assumed to have
an even distribution throughout the entire cross section.
Phosphorus,   with   a   smaller   segregation   coefficient,
needs  to  be  corrected  for  segregation  factor  for  each
zone  length  across  the  cross  section.    Determine  the
effective  segregation  coefficient  for  phosphorus,  based
on repeated measurements of control rods for a specific
sample diameter, coil design, and pull rate.
NOTE 3:  At one laboratory, segregation factors, based on an
effective  segregation  factor  of  0.5,  were  calculated  for  the
zone lengths of Figure 5 as shown in Table 1.</p><p>Figure 5

13. 3.3  Obtain    values    for    arsenic    and    aluminum
concentrations      from      photoluminescence      (SEMI

This  equation  assumes  that  the  conversion
factor for phosphorus is approximately 85 in the 100 to
5000 Ω·cm  resistivity  range,  as  indicated  in  SEMI
MF723.    Take  the  boron,  arsenic,  and  aluminum  from
the  photoluminescence  or  FT-IR  data  (see  Sections
13. 3.2 and 13.3.3).  Use these values and resistivity data

the volume averaged calculation of phosphorus.

Carbon    Calculation —    Calculate    carbon

14  Precision and Bias
14. 1  In  Section  11,  the  use  of  control  rod  samples  to
monitor  was  discussed.    Data  was  collected  for  156
control  rods,  as  discussed  in  Section  11  for  monitoring
interfering  contamination  levels  in  the  sample  prepara-
tion, etch procedure, and zoner furnace.  The rods were
zoned  in  three  different  growth  furnaces,  over  a  1-year
period.      All   samples   were   etched   by   the   same
procedure,  using  freshly  prepared  acid  for  each  etch
bath.    Boron  and  phosphorus  values  were  measured  by
photoluminescence  spectroscopy.    Carbon  values  were
measured by cryogenic FTIR spectroscopy.  Boron was
measured  at  6  zone  lengths  of  the  ingot,  phosphorus  at
12 zone lengths, and carbon at 12 zone lengths.  Results
are  shown  in  Table  2.    Precision  for  the  boron  and
phosphorus  measurement,  as  two  sigma,  is  stated  in
SEMI MF1389 as 0.002 ppba.  Precision for the carbon
measurement for SEMI MF1391 is stated as 0.02 ppma.

TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING SURFACE METAL
CONTAMINATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON BY ACID
EXTRACTION-ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  for  publication  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  16,  2004.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a></p><p>September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.    Original  edition  published  by  ASTM  International  as
ASTM F 1724-96.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1724-01.</p><p>1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  Surface  metal  contamination  is  a  parameter  that  is
frequently included in polysilicon specifications such as
JEITA EM-3601 and SEMI M16.</li><li>2  This   test   method   can   measure   the   elemental,
particularly metal, surface contamination on polysilicon
chunks.  Values are related to sample weight rather than
area due to the irregular size and form of the sample.</li><li>3  This  surface  measurement  of  metal  contamination
is used for monitoring polysilicon production processes,
development    of    new    processes,    and    materials
acceptance purposes.</li><li>4  This test method is used as a standard for defining
detection limits, and quantifying variations and method
interferences to allow interlaboratory correlations.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This     test     method     covers     the     quantitative
determination  of  surface  trace  metal  contamination  on
the  surface  of  polycrystalline  silicon  chunks  using  an
acid to extract the metals from the surface.  The metals
content  of  the  acid  is  then  diluted  and  analyzed  by
graphite furnace atomic-absorption spectroscopy.  With
suitable modifications that are not included herein, this
method  can  be  extended  to  analysis  of  granular  and
chip polysilicon.</li><li>2  This  test  method  can  be  used  for  various  rod,
chunk,  granule  and  chip  sizes,  for  polycrystalline  or
single   crystal   silicon,   to   determine   surface   metal
contaminants.    Since  the  area  of  irregularly-shaped
chunks,   chips,   or   granules   is   difficult   to   measure
accurately, values are based on sample weight.  Using a
sample weight of 50 to 300 g allows detection limits at
the 0.01 ppbw (parts per billion weight) level.</li><li>3  The    strength,    composition,    temperature,    and
exposure   time   of   the   acid   determine   the   depth   of
surface  etching  and  the  efficiency  of  the  extraction  of
the contaminants from the surface.  Less than 1% of the
sample weight is removed in this test method.</li><li>4  This test method is useful for determining the alkali
elements,   alkali   earth,   and   first   series   transition
elements,  such  as  sodium,  potassium,  calcium,  iron,
chromium,   nickel,   copper,   zinc,   as   well   as   other
elements  such  as  aluminum.    The  recovery  of  these
elements from the silicon surface is measured as greater
than  95%,  using  control  standards  intentionally  added
to the polysilicon surface.</li><li>5  This test method suggests a particular sample size,
acid  composition,  etch  cycle,  testing  environment,  and
instrument  protocol.    Variations  in  these  parameters
may be used, but may affect the recovery efficiency or
retention  of  metals  during  processing.    In  practice,  this
test method is used for sample weights of 25 to 5000 g.
For   referee   purposes,   this   test   method   specifies   a
sample  weight  of  300  g.    This  test  method  includes
guidelines  to  alert  the  analyst  to  the  interferences  and
resultant  variations  in  this  test  method,  and  includes
standard  methods  for  quantifying  and  reporting  these
variations.</li><li>6  This   test   method   specifies  the  use  of  graphite
furnace   atomic-absorption   spectroscopy   to   analyze
trace  metals  content  of  the  acid  extract.    Other  instru-
ments  of  equivalent  sensitivity,  such  as  inductively-
coupled plasma/mass spectrometry, may be used.</li><li>7  The  detection  limit  and  method  variation  depend
on  the  efficiency  of  the  acid  extraction  procedure,
sample  size,  the  method  interferences,  the  absorption
spectrum   of   each   element,   and   the   instrumental
sensitivity, background, and blank value.</li><li>8  This  test  method  uses  hot  acid  to  etch  away  the
surface   of   the   silicon.      The   etchant   is   potentially
harmful  and  must  be  handled  in  an  acid  exhaust  fume
hood,  with  utmost  care  at  all  times.    Hydrofluoric  acid
solutions  are  particularly  hazardous  and  should  not  be
used  by  anyone  who  is  not  familiar  with  the  specific
preventive  measures  and  first  aid  treatments  given  in
the appropriate Material Safety Data Sheet.</li></ol><p>SEMI MF1724-1104 © SEMI 2004 2
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  guides  and  determine  the
applicability  of  regulatory  or  other  limitations  prior  to
use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  The   common   interferences   of   absorption   spec-
troscopy  are  present  in  this  test  method,  including
overlap  of  absorption  peaks,  nonlinearity  of  absorption
peaks,  matrix  effects,  background  noise,  interelement
interferences, cross contamination, and instrument drift.
3. 2  Interferences  from  contamination  due  to  reagent
purity, cleanliness of apparatus, cleanliness of the room,
and  handling  techniques  during  sampling  and  proces-
sing are critical concerns.  This test method describes a
series  of  blanks  and  controls  to  monitor  and  quantify
these interferences.
3. 3  The  recovery  efficiency  of  the  acid  mixture  and
extraction   process   must   be   measured   in   order   to
monitor   any   interference   from   this   source.      Metal
contaminants   chemically   bound   to   the   surface   by
various treatments or in the bulk of the polysilicon may
not  be  recovered  by  this  acid  mixture.    Recovery  effi-
ciency can be confirmed by neutron activation analyses,
or by another test method.
3. 4  This    test    method    requires    a    sample    size
representative   of   the   lot   sample.      Since   surface
contamination  is  not  distributed  evenly  upon  a  surface,
sample   size   and   volume   must   be   chosen   to   be
representative of the lot.  If the sample size is too small,
the   sample   may   not   be   representative   of   the   lot,
resulting in excessive variation in duplicate samples.

5. 2.3  digested   blank   —   samples   of   acid,   with   no
analytes added, taken through the digestion process and
analyzed to provide a monitor of the analytical process
that  includes  acid  purity,  digestion  bottles  cleanliness,
cross contamination, and environment purity.

known   concentrations   of   the   analytes   to   provide
calibration  checks  on  the  instrument  and  the  digestion
procedure.
5. 2.5  digestion — holding the polysilicon chunks in the

ppbw,  and  20  ppbw  to  provide  a  calibration  standard
and set absorption values for the GFAAS instrument.
6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1  A  standard  weight  and  volume  of  chunk  sample  is
chosen  in  order  to  provide  a  consistent  basis  for  the
analysis   and   provide   a   basis   for   interlaboratory
correlation of analytical values.  For referee purposes, a
total sample weight of 300 g, taken as six chunks, each
approximately  3  by  3  by  3  cm,  at  50  g  each,  is
recommended.    A  minimum  of  three  of  the  six  pieces
should have an outside surface.  The outside surface, or
skin  of  the  polysilicon  rod,  is  thought  to  be  the  most
susceptible  to  contamination  during  the  rod  removal
and  chunk  processing  steps.    Choosing  a  minimum  of
half of the chunk samples to have an outside surface is
assumed to be representative of the lot characteristics.
6. 2  Making  sure  to  avoid  cross  contamination,  the
chunks  are  loaded  into  clean  PTFE  bottles,  covered
with  acid  etchant,  heated  in  a  fume  hood  and  the
surface of the chunks etched.  The chunks are removed
from the etchant, and the etchant heated to dryness on a
hotplate.
6. 3  The  dried  etchant  residue  is  dissolved  by  adding  2
mL of 5% HNO
3
and 8 mL of H
2
O to make a total of 10
mL.  This extract is then analyzed by GFAAS for trace
metals.
6. 4  The    sample    carrousel    tray    of    the    GFAAS
instrument is loaded with a series of blanks, calibration
standards,  and  monitor  standards,  along  with  the  acid
extract  samples.    The  temperature  program  for  the
graphite  furnace  is  optimized  for  maximum  sensitivity
and  the  absorption  spectral  lines  chosen  for  maximum
sensitivity    and    minimum    interferences    for    each
element.
6. 5  Data  from  the  GFAAS  instrument  is  collected  and
the  value  for  each  analyte  in  the  lot  sample  calculated.
For  each  analyte,  the  digested  blanks  are  averaged  to
provide   a   zero   reference.      This   average   value   is
subtracted from the lot sample value, and the remaining
value  multiplied  by  the  dilution  factor  to  obtain  the
reported  result.    The  dilution  factor  is  the  final  volume
of  the  acid  extract,  10  mL,  divided  by  the  starting
weight of the polysilicon sample.
6. 6  This   acid   mixture   has   a   measured   recovery
efficiency of 95% or greater for iron, chromium, nickel,
sodium,    zinc,    aluminum,    copper,    calcium,    and
potassium, in the chemically-bound form usually found
on  the  polysilicon  surface,  after  one  etch  cycle.    By
measuring  the  analytes  after  a  second  etch  cycle,  the
recovery  efficiency  of  the  first  cycle  is  determined.
Recovery efficiencies above 90% are required to verify
the  accuracy  of  the  analysis.    Recovery  efficiency  was
confirmed  by  neutron  activation  analyses.
6
To  ensure
that  no  analytes  are  lost  through  chemical  reaction  or
evaporation  processes,  digested  control  standards  are
prepared and monitored for each analyses.
6. 7  Contamination    from    the    room    environment,
apparatus,  reagents,  sampling  techniques,  and  handling
techniques  is  monitored  statistically  by  the  absorption
values  for  the  digested  blanks  and  digested  control
standards.
6. 8  The  detection  limit  depends  on  the  dilution  factor,
instrument  sensitivity,  spectral  response  of  the  analyte,
acid   recovery   efficiency,   blank   value,   and   method
interferences.    Instrument  and  method  variations  are
given in Section 14.

9  Sampling
9. 1  This   test   method   is   intended   for   sampling   of
polysilicon  lots.    Typically,  one  5-kg  bag  from  a  lot  is
selected  for  sampling.    The  sample  is  taken  from  this
bag,   and   the   surface   metals   values   analyzed   are
assumed    representative    of    the    lot.        Statistical
techniques, such as process capability ratios, are used to
determine   actual   sampling   plans   for   manufacturing
processes.    A  choice  of  sampling  plans  is  found  in
ASTM   Practice   E   122.      For   referee   purposes,   a
sampling  plan  shall  be  agreed  upon  before  conducting
the test.  Contamination during the sampling procedure
is a critical concern and must be avoided.
10  Calibration
10. 1  Prepare calibration and control standards for each
analyte,    according    to    instrument    manufacturer&#x27;s
instructions,    from    commercially-available    atomic-
absorption   elemental   calibration   standards,   at   1000
ppm, traceable to NIST Reference Standards.
10. 2  Prepare   a   series   of   calibration   and   control
standards  for  each  analyte  to  determine  the  instrument
calibration  curve,  monitor  recovery  efficiency  of  the
acid  etchant,  and  monitor  reagent  purity  and  purity  of
the environment.  Purpose of the calibration and control
standards is shown in Table 1.
10. 2.1  Determine  a  calibration  curve  for  each  element
with   a   blank   and   a   minimum   of   three   elemental
standards.  Dilute the 1000-ppm elemental standards to
1-ppm standards (0.1 mL/100 mL in acid etch mixture).
Prepare  calibration  standards  of  5  ppb,  10  ppb,  and  20
ppb  by  diluting  0.5  mL,  1  mL  and  2  mL  of  the  1-ppm
standard  to  100  mL  with  18-mL  acid  etch  mixture  and
deionized (DI) water.  Prepare the standards to provide
a  range  close  to  the  suspected  concentration  of  the
analyte.    Determine  the  four-point  calibration  curve
according    to    the    instructions    of    the    instrument
manufacturer.    Monitor  any  changes  in  the  calibration
curve by checking the linearity against previous runs.
NOTE 2:  These standards were chosen to provide calibration
for various samples over a range corresponding to 0.1 to 100
ppbw in the polysilicon sample.  The use of a 1-ppb standard
will provide a lower method variation for analytes in the sub-
ppb range.
10. 2.2  Collect  the  absorption  values  for  the  5  ppb,  10
ppb, and 20 ppb calibration standards in a database, and
establish   statistical   rules   to   determine   any   drift   or
excessive  variation  in  the  instrument  readings.    Repeat
the  analysis  if  these  values  exceed  the  statistical  limit.
Make corrections in the procedure or instrument if these
values continue out of statistical control.
10. 2.3  Prepare  two  control  standards,  at  10  ppb,  by
adding  10  mL  of  the  10-ppb  calibration  standards  to
samples  of  clean  polysilicon  chunks.    Digest  these
standards along with the lot samples.
NOTE 3:  These  standards  have  a  similar  matrix  to  the  lot
samples.      The   analysis   of   these   standards   provides   a
quantification  of  the  variation  in  metals  retention  efficiency,
instrument matrix effects, and variations due to cleanliness of
apparatus  and  contamination  during  handling  and  sample
processing.
10. 2.4  Collect  the  absorption  values  for  the  10-ppb
digested  control  standards  in  a  database,  and  establish
statistical  rules  to  determine  if  metals  retention  and
variations  due  to  method  interferences  are  in  statistical
control.    Repeat  the  analysis  if  these  values  exceed  the
statistical  limits.    Make  corrections  in  the  procedure  or
improvements in cleanliness of the apparatus and room
if these values continue out of statistical control.</p><p>SEMI MF1724-1104 © SEMI 2004 5

Lot samples To determine concentrations of the analytes.</p><ol start="10"><li>2.5  Prepare  two  acid  blanks  and  digest  along  with
the  lot  samples.    Measure  these  blanks  to  provide  a
quantification   of   variations   in   reagent   purity   and
contamination  that  occurs  from  the  room  environment
during processing.  Enter the values for the blanks into
a  database  and  establish  statistical  rules  to  determine
any excessive variation in the current value.  Repeat the
analysis if the current value is out of statistical control.</li><li>3  For  purposes  of  interlaboratory  correlation  and
comparison  of  techniques,  definitions  of  instrument
variation  and  this  test  method  variation  and  detection
limit are as follows:</li><li>3.1  Measure the instrument variation by analyzing a
2-ppb  standard  for  15  runs,  calculating  the  standard
deviation of the 15 values, then calculating the 3-sigma
value for each element.  Multiply the 3-sigma value by
the dilution factor to define the instrument variation.
NOTE 4:  Concentration  of  standards  are  chosen  based  on
instrument  manufacturer  recommendations  for  signal/noise
ratio and sensitivity values.</li><li>3.2  Measure  the  method  variation  by  analyzing  a
minimum  of  30  values  for  the  10-ppb  digested  control
standards.  Calculate the standard deviation for these 30
values  and  multiply  the  3-sigma  value  by  the  dilution
factor for each element to define the method variability
of this test method.
NOTE 5:  Method  variation  can  be  reduced  by  using  lower
concentration control standards and by making improvements
in  the  procedure,  room  cleanliness,  and  acid  purity.    These
improvements  are  monitored  by  continually  tracking  the  3-
sigma values for the digested control standards.</li><li>3.3  Measure   the   detection   limit   by   analyzing   a
minimum  of  30  values  for  the  digested  acid  blanks.
Calculate the standard deviation for these 30 values and
multiply  the  3-sigma  value  by  the  dilution  factor  for
each  element  to  define  the  detection  limit  of  this  test
method.
11  Procedure</li><li>1  Clean  bottles,  lids  and  tongs  between  analyses.
Conduct  additional  cleaning  and  analyses  of  blanks
when  using  new  bottles,  when  blank  values  indicate
contamination,  and  when  performing  referee  analyses.
Prepare clean bottles and lids as follows:</li><li>1.1  Rinse three times with DI water.</li><li>1.2  Fill the bottles with 500 mL of the acid cleaning
mixture and heat on the hot plate, lids fit loosely, for 6
h  at  100°C;  refill  the  bottles  with  the  acid  cleaning
mixture  and  heat  on  the  hot  plate,  no  lids,  for  6  h  at
100°C.</li><li>1.3  Rinse bottles and lids three times with DI water;</li><li>1.4  Fill  bottles  with  250-mL  acid  etch  mixture,  no
lids, and heat at 130 to 150°C until dryness, about 10 h.</li><li>1.5  Dissolve residue with 2 mL of 5% HNO
3
and 8
mL DI water; analyze using the GFAAS instrument.</li><li>1.6  Repeat  entire  procedure  if  the  GFAAS  analysis
shows contaminants are present in the sample bottles.</li><li>1.7  Triple rinse bottles and lids.</li><li>1.8  Fill  bottles  with  acid  cleaning  mixture  and  heat
for 6 h at 100°C.
NOTE 6:  Other  cleaning  procedures  may  be  used,  but  must
be monitored to prove effectiveness.</li><li>2  Choose  one  5-kg  bag  of  polysilicon  from  a  lot  to
be  sampled.    Deliver  the  bag  to  the  clean  room  for
sampling.    Choose  six  chunks  from  the  bag  as  the  lot
sample.    At  least  three  of  the  six  chunks  must  have  an
outside   surface.      Each   chunk   shall   be   about   50-g
weight,  with  an  approximate  size  of  3  by  3  by  3  cm,
total  weight  about  300  g.    If  the  sample  must  be  taken
in  a  location  other  than  the  analytical  laboratory,  seal
the  sample  in  double  bags  and  send  to  the  laboratory.
To minimize contamination from the room environment

analysis  steps  are  carried  out  in  a  clean  room  and
laminar  flow  hood,  with  analysts  in  full  clean  room
attire.      A   minimum   of   a   Class   6   clean   room,   as
established  in  ISO  14644–1  (Note  1),  is  required  to
minimize interferences from environmental sources.  In
the   laboratory,   open   the   double   bag   according   to
standard clean room practice and transfer the chunks to
a  clean,  numbered  PTFE  bottle  and  weigh  to  two
decimal  places.    Add  about  250  mL  of  acid  etching
mixture to each bottle to cover the chunks and seal with
PTFE lids.
11. 3  Place  the  sealed  bottles  onto  the  hot  plate  in  the
fume  hood  and  heat  for  about  60  min  at  about  70°C.
Remove  from  heat  and  cool,  then  remove  each  chunk
with PTFE tongs, rinsing the surface with DI water into
the  bottle.    Return  the  etchant  in  the  open  bottle  to  the
hot plate and heat to dryness at 110 to 150°C.
NOTE 7:  A  microwave  oven  may  be  used  in  place  of  a  hot
plate to reduce the digestion time required to take to dryness.
11. 4  Remove  the  bottle  from  the  hot  plate,  replace  the
lid  and  leave  to  cool.    Add  2  mL  of  5%  HNO
3
to  the
dried  etchant  residue  and  let  stand  for  about  20  min  to
dissolve  all  salts.    Add  8  mL  of  DI  water,  replace  lid,
and swirl to mix.  No solids should be observed in this
solution.
11. 5  Prepare  5-ppb,  10-ppb,  and  20-ppb  calibration
standards, control standards, and blanks (see 10.2).
11. 6  Load  samples  and  standards  into  the  GFAAS
instrument   sample   carrousel   tray.      Each   run   shall
include the following:
• Acid blank,
• 5-ppb calibration standard,
• 10-ppb calibration standard,
• 20-ppb calibration standard,
• First 10-ppb digested control standard,
• Second 10-ppb digested control standard,
• First digested blank,
• Second digested blank, and
• Lot samples.
11. 7  Choose  the  analysis  pattern  so  that  standards  and
blanks  are  run  before  and  after  samples  in  order  to
detect any shift in calibration during the analysis.
11. 8  Analytical Conditions
11. 8.1  Choose  and  record  the  furnace  and  instrument
parameters,  according  to  the  instrument  manufacturer&#x27;s
instructions,   for   the   sample   measurement.      This
includes the following:
• Furnace time/temperature profile,
• Slit width,
• Sample injection size, and
• Wavelength.

14  Precision and Bias
14. 1  Precision  —  The  precision  was  determined  by
making  several  analyses  of  a  calibration  standard  to
measure  within-laboratory  variation  and  by  conducting
interlaboratory correlations where polysilicon lots were
analyzed.
14. 2  Within-laboratory  Precision  —  Study  of  within-
laboratory   variation   consisted   of   daily   analyses   of
standards and lot samples over a one-year period using
the  acid  mixture,  procedure,  conditions,  and  statistical
control methods described in this test method.
14. 2.1  Variation  of  the  GFAA  instrument  used  was
determined  by  analyzing  a  2-ppb  standard  of  each
analyte   for   15   times.      The   instrument   reading   is
multiplied  by  the  dilution  factor,  10/300.    This  set  of
analyses was repeated over a period of several months.
The standard deviation of this set of analyses represents
the  variation  due  to  instrument  drift,  analyst  technique,
and room environment.</p><p>SEMI MF1724-1104 © SEMI 2004 7
14. 2.2  Method  variation  was  determined  by  analyzing
the  10-ppb  digested  control  standards  over  a  period  of
one  year.    Instrument  readings  of  concentration  values
are about 10 μg/L.  The standard deviation of this set of
values  represents  the  variation  due  to  metals  retention
efficiency,  reagent  purity,  apparatus  purity,  environ-
ment purity, and analyst technique.
14. 2.3  Lot  sample  analysis  variation  was  determined
by  analyzing  polysilicon  lot  samples  over  a  one-year
period.    The  standard  deviation  of  this  set  of  analyses
represents  the  variation  due  to  sampling  techniques,
contamination  during  sampling  and  processing  of  lots,
and the total analytical method variation.
14. 2.4  The  standard  deviations  in  these  studies  are
summarized in Table 2.

correlation studies were conducted to test the ability of
the   method   to   analyze   surface   contamination   in
polysilicon lots at the sub-ppbw level.  Each laboratory
used    different    polysilicon    sample    weights,    acid
mixtures,  and  dilution  factors,  but  all  performed  the
analyses  in  clean  rooms  with  high  purity  reagents,  and
calibration   controls.      All   polysilicon   samples   were
supplied  by  Laboratory  A,  with  lots  chosen  to  be
representative     of     polysilicon     with     only     trace
contaminants,  at  sub-ppbw  levels.    No  samples  with
added   contaminants   were   supplied;   this   correlation
study  was  to  determine  variation  at  these  levels  due  to
sampling,   the   different   analytical   procedures,   and
different   laboratory   environments.      Laboratory   A

PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION
OF SILICON INGOTS
This   standard   was   technically   approved   by   the   Global   Silicon   Wafer   Committee   and   is   the   direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the   North   American   Regional   Standards   Committee   on   September   16,   2003.      Initially   available   at
<a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> October 2003; to be published November 2003.  Originally published by ASTM International
as ASTM F 1725-97.  Last previous edition ASTM F 1725-02.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1    The  use  of  silicon  wafers  in  many  semiconductor
devices  requires  a  consistent  atomic  lattice  structure.
Crystal  defects  disturb  local  lattice  energy  conditions
that  are  the  basis  for  semiconductor  behavior.    These
defects have distinct effects on essential semiconductor
device-manufacturing  processes  such  as  alloying  and
diffusion.</li><li>2          This     practice     provides     guidance     regarding
procedures  for  analysis  of  crystal  defects  of  silicon
ingots from which silicon wafers are cut.</li><li>3  This practice together with the referenced standards
may   be   used   for   process   control,   research   and
development, and materials acceptance purposes.
2  Scope</li><li>1        This    practice    covers    the    analysis    of    the
crystallographic  perfection  in  silicon  ingots.    The  steps
described   are   sample   preparation,   etching   solution
selection   and   use,   defect   identification,   and   defect
counting.</li><li>2      This   practice   is   suitable   for   use   in   evaluating
silicon  grown  in  either  the  <!-- -->[111]<!-- -->  or  the  <!-- -->[100]<!-- -->  direction
and doped either p or n type with resistivity greater than</li><li>005 Ω·cm.

8  Safety Precautions</li><li>1      The   chemicals   used   in   polishing   etches   are
potentially  harmful  and  must  be  handled  in  a  chemical
exhaust fume hood, with the utmost care.</li><li>2        Hydrofluoric    acid    solutions    are    particularly
hazardous and the specific preventive measures must be
strictly observed.</li><li>3    Safety  or  protective  gear  should  be  worn  while
handling   these   acid   solutions   or   their   components.
Safety requirements vary, but the essentials are: plastic
gloves, safety glasses, face shield, acid gown, and shoe
covers.
9  Procedure</li><li>1  Sample Selection — Take the sample for evaluation
from  the  crystal  close  to  the  discarded  crystal  portion
found at the last of the solidified crystal.  Other samples
may be specified in producer-consumer relationships.
NOTE 1:  Determination  of  the most  logical  point  of  sample
selection may be established by inspection of the bottom taper
of the crystal.  If the crystal has a complete bottom taper, then
the  sample  should  be  obtained  from  the  last  point  of  a  full
crystal  diameter.    If  the  crystal  has  lost  zero  dislocation
growth  before  the  formation  of  a  tapered  bottom,  obtain  the
sample   1–crystal   diameter   above   the   point   of   lost   zero
dislocation structure.</li><li>2  Orient the ingot to be sliced with either the x-ray or
optical method of SEMI MF26 so that the surface to be
exposed is within 5° of the desired plane.  Slice a wafer,</li><li>5-  to  2-mm  thick,  from  the  crystal.    Identify  ingot
growth  lines  on  the  sample  by  a  mark  or  a  ground  flat
for future reference in counting defects.
NOTE  2:    Defects  observed  by  preferential  etching  may  be
increasingly   distorted   as   misalignment   from   the   major
crystallographic plane increases.</li><li>3    Remove  the  residual  saw  damage  by  mechanical
lapping    and    chemical    polishing    or    by    chemical
polishing alone.</li><li>3.1    Wash  the  as-cut  or  lapped  wafer  in  a  nonionic
surfactant  detergent  solution  and  rinse  thoroughly  in
water.    Drying  may  be  hastened  by  use  of  a  lint-free
paper  towel.    The  surface  must  be  uniformly  matte  in
appearance with no scratches, wax, dirt or water stains.</li><li>3.2  Chemical Polish</li><li>3.2.1        Place    the    sample    in    the    bottom    of    a
hydrofluoric  acid  resistant  beaker  with  the  side  to  be
inspected  facing  upward.    The  beaker  diameter  need
only be larger than the wafer diameter.</li><li>3.2.2  Pour the room temperature chemical polish etch
(from  Section  7.3)  until  the  surface  of  the  sample  is
covered with about 1 cm of solution.</li><li>3.2.3        Agitate    during    etching    to    reduce    bubble
formation and surface artifacts.
NOTE  3:    The  polish  etch  procedure  in  Section  9.3  describes
a facility for evaluation of a small number of samples.  More
sophisticated facilities are used in commercial environments.</li><li>3.2.4    Rapidly  dilute  the  etching  solution  with  water
and  flush  the  solution  from  the  beaker  after  the  sample
wafer develops mirror-polished surfaces.</li></ol><p>SEMI MF1725-1103 © SEMI 2003 3
NOTE   4:      Staining   may   occur   on   heavily   doped,   p-type
material with resistivity of ≤ 0.1 Ω·cm, during dilution of the
polishing  etch.    Rapid  transfer  to  fresh  polish  etch  for  less
than 30 s additional etching, followed by rapid flushing of the
polish etch can reduce silicon staining.  If necessary, dilution
of  the  polishing  etch  with  nitric  acid  flushing  with  water  is
also effective in reducing stains.
9. 3.2.5    Dry  with  filtered  air  or  nitrogen  after  thorough
rinsing of the polish-etched sample.
9. 4    Select  an  appropriate  etching  solution  to  decorate
the defects.
9. 4.1    Refer  to  SEMI  MF1809  to  select  an  appropriate
etching solution.
9. 4.2  Etch the samples to remove an amount of silicon
from   the   surface   being   evaluated,   as   agreed   upon
between the parties to the test.  If no removal amount is
defined, remove 5 to 15 μm of silicon from the surface
being evaluated.
9. 5    Evaluate  the  preferentially  etched  sample  in  two
stages, macroscopic and microscopic.
9. 5.1  Macroscopic  Inspection  —  Use  a  high  intensity
light, such as that specified in SEMI MF523, to inspect
the  full  sample  surface.    The  characteristic  patterns  of
slip defects as shown in Figure 1 are easily identified in
macroscopic    inspection.        If    evidence    exists    of
mechanically     or     handling     induced     damage     or
contamination, repeat Sections 9.3 to 9.5 .
9. 5.2  Microscopic   Defect   Counting   —   Count   and
report    the    density    of    observed    defects    using
SEMI MF1810.

PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION
OF SILICON WAFERS
This   standard   was   technically   approved   by   the   Global   Silicon   Wafer   Committee   and   is   the   direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the   North   American   Regional   Standards   Committee   on   September   3,   2003.      Initially   available   at
<a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> October 2003; to be published November 2003.  Originally published by ASTM International
as ASTM F 1726-97.  Last previous edition ASTM F 1726-02.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1    The  use  of  silicon  crystals  in  many  semiconductor
devices  requires  a  consistent  atomic  lattice  structure.
Crystal  defects  disturb  local  lattice  energy  conditions
that  are  the  basis  for  semiconductor  behavior.    These
defects have distinct effects on essential semiconductor-
device  manufacturing  processes  such  as  alloying  and
diffusion.</li><li>2    Epitaxial  growth  processes  are  used  extensively  in
the manufacture of silicon electronic devices.  Stacking
faults  introduced  during  epitaxial  growth  can  cause
“soft”  electrical  characteristics  and  preferential  micro
plasma breakdowns in diodes.</li><li>3    Epitaxial  defects  are  more  clearly  delineated  with
the use of this destructive etching procedure.  Epitaxial
wafers  may  however  be  classified  nondestructively  by
this method without the destructive preferential etching
and inspection steps.</li><li>4    This  practice  provides  guidance  regarding  proce-
dures  for  analysis  of  crystal  defects  of  silicon  ingots
from which silicon wafers are cut.</li><li>5  This    practice,    together    with    the    referenced
standards,  may  be  used  for  process  control,  research
and development, and material acceptance purposes.
2  Scope</li><li>1      This   practice   covers   the   determination   of   the
density   of   crystallographic   defects   in   unpatterned
polished  and  epitaxial  silicon  wafers.    Epitaxial  silicon
wafers  may  exhibit  dislocations,  hillocks,  shallow  pits
or  epitaxial  stacking  faults,  while  polished  wafers  may
exhibit  several  forms  of  crystallographic  defects  or
surface damage.  Use of this practice is based upon the
application   of   several   referenced   standards   in   a
prescribed  sequence  to  reveal  and  count  microscopic
defects or structures.</li><li>2    This  practice  is  suitable  for  use  with  epitaxial  or
polished wafers grown in either <!-- -->[111]<!-- --> or <!-- -->[100]<!-- --> direction
and  doped  either  p  or  n-type  with  resistivity  greater
than 0.005 Ω·cm.</li><li>3    This  practice  is  suitable  for  use  with  epitaxial
wafers with layer thickness greater than 0.5 μm.</li><li>4      Additional   requirements   on   the   material   to   be
tested are listed in SEMI MF1810.
NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address the
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

5  Summary of Practice
5. 1  Clean, unprocessed polished or epitaxial wafers are
selected.    The  wafers  are  examined  under  bright  light
illumination    to    ensure    that    they    are    free    from
contamination  and  obvious  surface  damage.    Epitaxial</p><p>1  Currently available in Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol 10.05.

wafers  may  also  be  microscopically  inspected  before
etching  to  count  and  classify  visible  imperfections.
Wafers  are  then  etched  in  a  preferential  defect  etchant
solution.    The  etched  surface  is  again  examined  under
bright light illumination to identify patterns that may be
related  to  contamination  or  improper  handling.    The
imperfections highlighted by the preferential etchant are
then microscopically counted and classified.
6  Apparatus
6. 1  Safety Equipment and Facility — for defect etching
as described in SEMI MF1809.
6. 2  Wafer     Inspection     Facilities     and     Handling
Equipment  —  consistent  with  industry  practice  and
suitable for use with SEMI MF523.
7  Reagents and Materials
7. 1  Refer to SEMI MF1809 for specific information on
reagents and materials.
8  Procedure
8. 1    Select  an  unprocessed,  polished  or  epitaxial  wafer,
ready for use in the fabrication of electronic devices.
8. 1.1    Open  the  wafer  container  in  a  particle-controlled
environment.
8. 1.2      Transfer   the   wafer   with   a   robotic   tool   or   a
nonmetallic  vacuum  pencil,  contacting  the  wafer  edge
or  back  surface.    Ensure  that  the  front  surface  of  the
adjacent wafer is not contacted during the removal.
NOTE  1:    Any  contact  with  the  front  surface  of  the  adjacent
wafer  can  transfer  contamination  and  generally  scratch  the
surface.
8. 2  Preliminary Sample Inspection:
8. 2.1  Inspect the first sample using high intensity light
conditions as described in SEMI MF523 to identify any
surface   imperfections,   scratches,   or   contamination
hazes  that  may  interfere  with  the  etching  process  or
confound  the  result.    If  any  of  these  interferences  are
detected, select a separate sample for analysis.
NOTE  2:    These  interferences  can  generate  artifacts  that  may
be confused with the true defects.
8. 2.2  Epitaxial Wafer, Nondestructive Defect Counting
—    Inspect    epitaxial    wafers    microscopically    in
accordance  with  SEMI  MF1810  before  defect  etching
to count most of the epitaxial stacking fault defects.</p><p>{100}                                {111}</p><p>NOTE: The orientation of the wafer defines the location and
direction of the line defects.

Slip Defects as Seen with Macroscopic High-
Intensity Light Inspection</p><p>NOTE  3:    Epitaxial  defects  are  more  clearly  delineated  with
etching, but that is a destructive process.
8. 3  Defect Etching
8. 3.1  Epitaxial  Wafers  —  Etch  samples  with  epitaxial
layers  greater  than  2-μm  thickness  (as  measured  by
SEMI  MF95)  with  removal  of  at  least  0.5  μm  to
highlight  the  crystal  defects  for  quantification.    Etch
samples  with  epitaxial  layers  less  than  2  μm  with
removal  of  no  more  than  50%  of  the  layer  thickness.
Other   removal   amounts   are   acceptable   based   upon
producer-consumer agreement. (See Note 4.)
8. 3.2  Polished  Wafers  —  The  sample  must  be  etched
with  a  removal  of  5  to  15  μm  to  highlight  the  crystal
defects  for  quantification.    Other  removal  amounts  are
acceptable based upon producer/consumer agreement.
8. 3.3      Refer   to   SEMI   MF1809   for   more   etching
information.
NOTE  4:    Crystal  defects  become  more  clearly  visible  for
unaided eye inspection with increased removal, but resolution
of  the  epitaxial  induced  defects  is  reduced  with  increasing
etch times.
8. 4  Sample  Inspection  —  Evaluate  the  preferentially
etched    sample    in    two    stages,    macroscopic    and
microscopic.
8. 4.1    First  inspect  the  sample  macroscopically  under
high    intensity    light    conditions    as    described    in
SEMI  MF523  to  detect  patterns  of  defects,  such  as  the
slip patterns shown schematically in Figure 1.</p><p>SEMI MF1726-1103 © SEMI 2003 3</p><p>a                                             b

mechanically     or     operator     induced     damage     or
contamination   is   observed,   because   these   artifacts
interfere   with   the   identification   of   crystal   growth
defects.
NOTE  5:    Slip  defects  may  be  differentiated  from  the  crystal
growth  defects  by  insuring  that  all  of  the  defects  are  aligned
as  shown  in  Figure  1.    Figure  2  shows  the  characteristics  of

PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN
POLISHED SILICON WAFERS
This   practice   was   technically   approved   by   the   Global   Silicon   Wafer   Committee   and   is   the   direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the   North   American   Regional   Standards   Committee   on   December   4,   2003.      Initially   available   at
<a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> February 2004; to be published March 2004.  Originally published by ASTM International as
ASTM F 1727-97.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1727-02.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1    Defects  induced  by  thermal  processing  of  silicon
wafers  may  adversely  influence  device  performance
and yield.</li><li>2          These     defects     are     influenced     directly     by
contamination,  ambient  atmosphere,  temperature,  time
at  temperature,  and  rate  of  change  of  temperature  to
which  the  specimens  are  subjected.    Conditions  vary
significantly among device manufacturing technologies.
The  thermal  cycling  procedures  of  this  practice  are
intended     to     simulate     basic     device     processing
technologies.    Oxidation  cycles  other  than  specified
herein,  or  multiple  oxidation  cycles,  may  sometimes
more accurately simulate device-processing procedures.
The results obtained may differ significantly from those
obtained with the specified oxidation cycles.</li><li>3    The  geometry  of  some  patterns  revealed  by  this
practice  suggests  that  they  are  related  to  the  crystal
growth  process  while  others  seem  related  to  surface
preparation or thermal cycling conditions.</li><li>4      This   practice   is   suitable   for   acceptance   testing
when used with referenced practices and methods.
2  Scope</li><li>1    This  practice  covers  the  detection  of  crystalline
defects  in  the  surface  region  of  silicon  wafers.    The
defects  are  induced  or  enhanced  by  oxidation  cycles
encountered    in    normal    device    processing.        An
atmospheric  pressure  oxidation  cycle  representative  of
bipolar,     metal-oxide-silicon     (MOS)     and     CMOS
technologies  is  included.    This  practice  reveals  strain
fields   arising   from   the   presence   of   precipitates,
oxidation induced stacking faults, and shallow etch pits.
Slip  is  also  revealed  that  arises  when  internal  or  edge
stresses are applied to the wafer.</li><li>2  Application of this practice is limited to specimens
that   have   been   chemical   or   chemical/mechanical
polished  to  remove  surface  damage  from  at  least  one
side of the specimen.  This practice may also be applied
to detection of defects in epitaxial layers.</li><li>3  The surface of the specimen opposite the surface to
be   investigated   may   be   damaged   deliberately   or
otherwise  treated  for  gettering  purposes  or  chemically
etched to remove damage.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1      Material   having   residual   work   damage   in   the
polished   surface   exhibits   visible   patterns   when   the
procedures  of  this  practice  are  used.    Usually,  edge
damage,  lapping  damage,  tool  marks,  or  scratches  are
easily identified by the location and pattern observed.</li><li>2        Contamination    not    removed    by    preparatory
cleaning  procedures  or  deposited  following  cleaning,
may  become  visible  after  oxidation  and  preferential
etching.</li><li>3  Slip may be introduced by differential expansion at
the  points  of  wafer  support  in  the  furnace  boat.    Slip
radiating from the points of support may be assumed to
originate from this boat pinch and not be inherent in the
unprocessed  wafer.    Slip  may  also  be  caused  by  large
thermal   gradients   imposed   across   a   wafer   by   fast
insertion or removal from the furnace.</li><li>4        If    the    oxidation    furnace    or    apparatus    is
contaminated,   it   can   cause   extraneous   artifacts   or
defects.</li><li>5      Striations,   helical   features   on   the   surface   of   a
silicon    wafer,    are    ascribed    to    periodic    dopant
incorporation differences occurring at the rotating solid-
liquid  interface  during  crystal  growth.    These  features
are visible to the unaided eye after preferential etching,
seem continuous under 100× magnification, and may be
confused with ring patterns of oxidation stacking faults.</li><li>6      Otherwise   identical   wafers   with   different   back

TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY
VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE
This  test  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the   North   American   Regional   Standards   Committee   on   December   4,   2003.      Initially   available   at
<a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> February 2004; to be published March 2004.  Originally published by ASTM International as
ASTM F 1771-97.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1392-97 (Reapproved 2002).
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  The technique outlined in this test method is meant
to  standardize  the  procedure,  analysis  and  reporting  of
oxide  integrity  data  via  the  voltage  ramp  technique
among  interested  parties.    However,  since  the  values
obtained  cannot  be  entirely  divorced  from  the  process
of  fabricating  the  test  structure,  suitable  correlations
should   be   performed   based   on   process   needs   and
structure  selection.    This  correlation  should  include
sample size as well as device geometry.</li><li>2    Measurement  of  the  electrical  integrity  of  oxides
grown on silicon wafers may also be used in-house as a
means  of  monitoring  the  quality  of  furnaces  and  other
processing  steps  as  well  as  judging  the  impact  of
changing some processing steps.</li><li>3      Selection   of   various   edge   and   area   intensive
structures  is  crucial  for  isolating  the  nature  of  the
defects.  Techniques for using such structures to isolate
the  nature  of  detected  defects  is  beyond  the  scope  of
this test method.</li><li>4    The  actual  results  are  somewhat  dependent  on  the
choice  of  gate  electrode.    Polysilicon  gates  have  the
advantage  of  being  identical  to  finished  product  in
many  instances.    Even  for  polysilicon  gates,  exact
results   depend   upon   values   chosen   for   polysilicon
thickness, doping, and sheet resistance.
2  Scope</li><li>1  The techniques outlined in this standard are for the
purpose  of  standardizing  the  procedure  of  measure-
ment,  analysis,  and  reporting  of  oxide  integrity  data
between interested parties.</li><li>1.1        This    test    method    makes    no    representation
regarding       actual       device       failure       rates       or
acceptance/rejection criteria.</li><li>1.2    While  some  suggestions  for  data  analysis  are
included    in    later    sections    of    this    test    method,
interpretation  of  results  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this
standard.    Any  such  interpretations  should  be  agreed
upon  between  interested  parties  prior  to  testing.    For
example,  a  variety  of  failure  criteria  are  included  to
permit  separation  of  so-called  intrinsic  and  extrinsic
oxide failures.
NOTE 1:  In  this  regard  this test  method  differs  from  that
given  in  SEMI  M51,  which  is  focused  on  application  of  gate
oxide   integrity   measurements,   as   described   in   this   test
method,  to  determine  the  density  of  crystal  originated  pits  in
the wafer under test.  SEMI M51 also provides a standardized
procedure for fabricating the MOS capacitors.</li><li>2    The  background  of  this  test  method  is  provided  in
Related Information 1.</li><li>3    This  test  method  covers  the  procedure  for  gaging
the electrical strength of silicon dioxide thin films with
thicknesses ranging from approximately 3 nm to 50 nm.
In  the  analysis  of  films  of  4  nm  or  less,  the  impact  of
direct  tunneling  on  the  current-voltage  characteristics,
and   hence   the   specified   failure   criteria   defined   in
Section  5.4,  must  be  taken  into  account.    Since  oxide
integrity     strongly     depends     on     wafer     defects,
contamination,  cleanliness,  as  well  as  processing,  the
users  of  this  test  method  are  expected  to  include  wafer
manufacturers and device manufacturers.</li><li>4  This test method is not structure specific, but notes
regarding options for different structures may be found
in  the  appendix.    The  three  most  likely  structures  are
simple    planar    metal-oxide    semiconductor    (MOS-
capacitors)   (fabricated   or   mercury   probe),   various
isolation  structures  (for  example,  local  oxidation  of
silicon (LOCOS)), and field effect transistors.  This test
method  assumes  that  a  low  resistance  ohmic  contact  is
made to the backside of each wafer in each case.  For a
more detailed discussion of the design and evaluation of
test structures for this test method, the reader is referred
to the EIA/JEDEC Standard 35-1.</li><li>5  Failure criteria specified in this test method include
both the fixed current limit (soft) and destructive (hard)
types. In the past, use of a fixed current limit of 1 μA or
more  virtually  ensured  measurement  of  hard  failure,  as
the  thicker,  more  heavily  contaminated  oxides  of  those
days   typically   failed   catastrophically   as   soon   as
measurable    currents    were    passed.    The    cleaner
processing of thinner oxides now means that oxides will
sustain   relatively   large   currents   with   little   or   no
evidence  of  failure.  While  use  of  fixed  current  limit
testing  may  still  be  of  value  for  assessing  uniformity</li></ol><p>SEMI MF1771-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 2
issues,  it  is  widely  felt  that  failure  to  continue  oxide
breakdown  testing  to  the  point  of  catastrophic  oxide
failure may mask the presence of defect tails, which are
of  critical  importance  in  assessing  long-term  oxide
reliability.  For  this  reason,  this  test  method  makes
provision for use of fixed limit failure criteria if desired
and  agreed  upon  by  the  parties  to  the  testing,  but
specifies  that  testing  be  continued  until  hard  failure  is
sensed.
2. 6      This   test   method   specifically   does   not   include
measurement     of     a     charge-to-breakdown     (Q
bd
)
parameter.   Industry   experience   with   this   parameter
measured in a ramp-to-failure test such as this indicates
that Q
bd
values   so   obtained   may   be   unreliable
indicators  of  oxide  quality.  This  is  because  a  large
fraction  of  the  value  determined  is  collected  in  the  last
steps  of  the  test,  and  the  result  is  subject  to  large
deviations. Q
bd
should  be  measured  in  a  constant
current  or  bounded  current  ramp  test.  This  test  method
is applicable to both n-type and p-type wafers, polished
or  having  an  epitaxial  layer.    In  wafers  with  epitaxial
layers,  the  conductivity  type  of  the  layer  should  be  the
same  as  that  of  the  bulk  wafer.    While  not  excluding
depletion  polarity,  it  is  preferred  that  measurement
polarity   should   be   in   accumulation   to   void   the
complication  of  a  voltage  drop  across  the  depletion
layer.
2. 7  While this test method is primarily intended for use
in  characterizing  the  SiO
2
-silicon  systems  as  stated
above,   it   may   be   applied   in   general   terms   to   the
measurement   of   other   metal-insulator-semiconductor
structures     if     appropriate     consideration     of     the
characteristics of the other materials is made.
2. 8      Measurement   conditions   specified   in   this   test
method are conservative, intended for thorough analysis
of  high  quality  oxide-silicon  systems,  and  to  provide  a
regime  in  which  new  users  may  safely  begin  testing
without encountering undue experimental artifacts.  It is
recognized   that   some   experienced   users   may   be
working   in   applications   where   less   precise   data   is
required and a more rapid test is desirable.  An example
of  this  situation  is  the  evaluation  of  silicon  wafer
quality,  where  a  staircase  voltage  step  providing  0.5
MV/cm  oxide  field  strength  resolution  and  a  voltage
step   duration   of   0.2   s   has   been   used.      Such   test
conditions   may   be   specified   when   agreed   upon   as
adequate by all participants to the testing.  Because the
dependence    of    measured    parameters    upon    test
conditions may increase as these conditions depart from
those  specified  in  this  test  method,  it  is  important  that
all   parties   to   these   tests   use   the   same   set   of   test
conditions, so that their results are comparable.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  Since this is a dc measurement, care must be taken
to make sure that the wafer has a low resistance ohmic
return   contact.      This   is   preferably   done   with   a
metallized  contact  to  the  back  side  of  the  wafer  under
test.  In cases where testing must be done on capacitors
in  diffused  wells  of  conductivity  type  opposite  to  the
substrate,   top   side   contacts   carefully   designed   to
provide  uniform,  low  resistance  to  all  parts  of  the  test
capacitor should be used.  A discussion of these design
criteria is given in Standard 35-1.
3. 2    It  is  strongly  suggested  that  testing  be  done  with  a
voltage   polarity   to   accumulate   the   silicon   surface
underlying   the   oxide;   positive   voltages   for   n-type
substrates  and  negative  voltages  for  p-type  substrates.
If this is not done, a topside contact to a diffused region
of opposite conductivity type surrounding the capacitor
(a gated diode or transistor) should be used to minimize
the  problem  of  uncontrolled  voltage  drops  across  the
inversion  layer  during  testing.    This  is  an  absolute
requirement   for   testing   p-type   substrate   capacitors
under   positive   bias,   where   sufficient   electrons   to
support  conduction  and  breakdown  are  not  available
without the n-type region.
3. 3    Evaluation  and  control  of  electrical  noise  in  the
current-voltage data taken as part of this test method is
crucial to the proper identification of the failure criteria,
particularly the ln J-V slope change criterion defined in
Section  9.9.4.    Approaches  for  minimizing  electrical
noise  in  the  measurements  are  suggested  in  Section  7
on  Apparatus,  and  an  approach  for  noise  evaluation  is
given in Section 10.3.
3. 4    Control  of  the  voltage  step  time  may  be  difficult
when   using   automated   electrometers   in   a   voltage
staircase  regime.    While  the  required  100-ms  step  time
may  be  set  using  a  delay  in  the  measurement  loop,  an
additional,  uncontrolled  delay  may  be  incurred  due  to
autoranging  of  the  electrometer.    The  effect  is  most
pronounced  for  very  low  currents,  where  the  measured
value   is   several   orders   of   magnitude   below   the
minimum  range  set  by  the  electrometer  software.    An
example of this effect is discussed in Section 10.3.
3. 5    The  method  of  probing  the  device  may  affect  the
results.      Examples   of   possible   variables   are   probe
pressure  and  use  of  a  contact  pad  versus  direct  contact
to the gate.
3. 6        Use    of    gate    electrode    material    other    than
polysilicon   may   mask   differences   in   materials   and</p><p>SEMI MF1771-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 3
make  the  material  look  worse  than  it  might  otherwise
appear if polysilicon gates are used.  This is because the
process of forming a gate electrode on an oxide sample
may affect the integrity of that oxide either for better or
for     worse.          Sputtering     or     radiation     damage
accompanying metal gate deposition may degrade oxide
integrity,  while  the  high  temperature  annealing  and
gettering  associated  with  polysilicon  deposition  and
doping may improve oxide quality.  On the other hand,
stress  arising  from  crystal  formation  in  the  polysilicon,
or impurity diffusion along polysilicon grain boundaries
may degrade oxide integrity.  Changes of gate-substrate
work function difference may also affect the breakdown
and  wearout  mechanisms  in  the  oxide.    Therefore,
potential  effects  of  gate  electrode  material  choice  on
test results must not be neglected.
3. 7    The  actual  values  obtained  depend  somewhat  on
the processing involved in fabricating the test structure.
Care must be taken to ensure a consistent processing.
3. 8  Wafer temperature during testing should be clearly
defined.    While  oxide  breakdown  voltages  are  not
strongly   temperature-dependent,   the   oxide   wearout
mechanism     is     temperature-sensitive,     and     large
temperature variations might have an impact on results.
3. 9  Warning —   Since   the   voltage   and   currents
involved  are  potentially  dangerous,  appropriate  means
of  preventing  the  operator  from  coming  into  contact
with  the  probe  tip  or  other  charged  surfaces  should  be
in place before testing.
3. 10  When testing very thin oxides, those 10 nm or less
in  thickness,  special  care  must  be  taken  to  account  for
effects  arising  from  the  very  high  specific  capacitance
of these films.  These may include voltage drops across

5. 1  Definitions
5. 1.1  hard  failure  —  destructive  failure  of  an  MOS
capacitor associated with rupture of the oxide film.
5. 1.1.1  Discussion  —  This  is  sensed  by  an  abrupt,
irreversible change in the current-voltage characteristics
of  the  capacitor.    In  this  test  method,  hard  failure  is
determined    by    a    relatively    large    change    in    dc
conduction  level  between  voltage  steps,  or  as  a  change
in  the  logarithmic  slope  of  the  current  density-voltage
characteristic.
5. 1.2  soft failure — failure of an MOS capacitor sensed
by its passage of an electrical current equal to or greater
than a predetermined value.
5. 1.2.1  Discussion — This type of failure may be either
destructive or nondestructive, as in the case of Fowler-
Nordheim or direct tunneling currents.
5. 1.3  failure  modes  A,  B,  and  C  —  in  the  reporting  of
hard   and   soft   breakdown   failure   results,   data   is
sometimes summarized in terms of ranges of oxide field
strength in which the breakdown occurred.
5. 1.3.1  Discussion  —  One  set  of  categories  widely

8  Sampling
8. 1    Sampling  is  the  responsibility  of  the  user  of  this
test  method.    However,  if  testing  is  done  as  part  of  a
comparison  or  correlation,  sampling  shall  be  agreed
upon in advance by all participants.
NOTE  2:    Refer  to  the  appendix  of  Standard  35  for  a  good
discussion of sampling plan statistics.
9  Procedure
9. 1  Before   the   measurement,   record   the   following
information  for  each  sample:  sample  identity,  date,
time,   operator,   instrument   station   identity   (if   any),
average    oxide    thickness,    gate    area    in    square
centimeters, gate material, oxide type (example thermal
versus  deposited),  structure  type,  conductivity  type  (n
or p),   bias   mode   (accumulation   or   depletion),   test
temperature.
9. 2    Establish  the  test  parameters  relevant  to  the  test
system and the sample.  These include the voltage ramp
rate,  computed  in  accordance  with  the  calculation  in
Section 10.2, and the noise threshold level and in some
instances  the  ln  J-V  slope  ratio  for  the  hard  failure
criterion    in    Section    9.9.5,    both    determined    in
accordance with the calculation in Section 10.3.
9. 3  Set the applied voltage to zero volts.
9. 4    Recognizing  that  some  information  on  extrinsic
defects may be lost, perform a pretest as follows.  If it is
desired not to lose the information on extrinsic defects,
proceed to Section 9.5.
9. 4.1    Bias  the  gate  into  accumulation  at  the  voltage  of
use.  If the measured current exceeds a value equivalent
to  1.0  ×  10
–5
A/cm

(or  a  current  value  of  10  nA  if  the
device area is at or below 10
–3

), record this device
as a Category 0 failure and proceed to Section 9.11.
9. 5    From  the  starting  bias  condition  (zero  if  no  pretest
was  done,  or  the  voltage  of  use  if  a  pretest  was  used)
record voltage and current.
9. 6      Begin   increasing   the   voltage   bias   at   a   rate
equivalent  to  an  electric  field  increment  of  1.0  ±  0.1

.  Note that other ramp rates may be used
if it can be shown that it does not affect the results, or if
it is agreed upon by all parties to the test.
9. 7    Record  current-voltage  data  at  an  interval  no  more
than  0.1  s  between  readings,  or  at  least  once  near  the
end of each voltage step.
9. 8  After each current reading, test to see if any of the
soft  failure  criteria  have  been  met.    If  so,  store  the
appropriate value.
9. 9    After  each  current  reading,  check  to  see  if  one  of
the hard failure criteria has been reached.
9. 9.1    Check  to  see  if  the  current  has  increased  to  a
value greater than or equal to 0.98 times the compliance
limit  of  the  voltage  ramp  source.    If  so,  record  the
previous  voltage  level  as  the  hard  failure  voltage,  and
set the failure category to 1.  Divide the current level at
the  previous  measurement  point  by  the  capacitor  area,
and record this value as the hard failure current density
for this unit.
9. 9.2    Check  to  see  if  the  current  has  increased  by  a
factor of 1000 or more from the previous reading.  If so,
record  the  previous  voltage  level  as  the  hard  failure
voltage,  and  set  the  failure  category  to  2.    Divide  the
current  value  measured  at  the  previous  point  by  the
capacitor area, and record this value as the hard failure
current density.
9. 9.3    Check  to  see  if  the  current  has  increased  by  a
factor  of  10  or  more  in  two  consecutive  voltage  steps.
If  so,  record  the  previous  voltage  level  as  the  hard
failure voltage, and set the failure category to 3.  Divide
the current value measured at the previous point by the
capacitor area, and record this value as the hard failure
current density.
9. 9.4    If  the  current  is  above  the  noise  threshold  level,
check for an abrupt increase in the current by a factor of
ten.    If  this  has  occurred,  record  the  previous  voltage
level  as  the  hard  failure  voltage,  and  set  the  failure
category to 4.  Divide the current value measured at the
previous  point  by  the  capacitor  area,  and  record  this
value as the hard failure current density.
9. 9.5    If  the  current  is  above  the  noise  threshold  level,
check  for  an  abrupt  change  in  the  logarithmic  slope  of
the  current  density-voltage  characteristic  of  the  unit.
To  minimize  the  chance  of  detecting  a  false  reading,
use  the  average  of  the  previous  five  (V,I)  data  pairs  to
compute  the  established  slope,  and  the  current  and
previous (V, I) data pairs to compute the new slope.  A
change by a factor of three shall constitute a failure.  If
this  has  occurred,  record  the  previous  voltage  level  as
the  hard  failure  voltage,  and  set  the  failure  category  to</p><p>SEMI MF1771-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 6
5.    Divide  the  current  value  measured  at  the  previous
point by the capacitor area, and record this value as the
hard failure current density.
9. 10  After hard failure has been detected by one of the
criteria in Section 9.9 or the upper test voltage limit has
been   reached,   perform   a   post-test   using   the   same
criteria defined for the pretest in Section 9.4.1.  This is
to be done whether a pretest was elected in Section 9.4
or not.  If the unit fails the post-test conditions, modify
the   failure   category   in   some   way   to   reflect   this
observation.  For example, one may change the sign of
the failure category number, or add an asterisk.
9. 11  Proceed to the next device to be tested, and repeat
Sections 9.3–9.10 until all devices are tested.

10. 2  Oxide  Voltage  and  Electric  Field  Strength  as  a
Function of Applied Voltage — Since ramp voltage test
increments  and  ramp  rates  as  well  as  some  breakdown
voltage  data  analyses  are  specified  in  terms  of  oxide
electric  field  strength,  it  is  important  to  consider  the
conversion  of  applied  voltages  to  oxide  voltage  and
electric  field  values  for  these  two  cases.    Historically,
oxide  electric  field  strength  has  been  approximated
simply by dividing the applied voltage by the thickness
of the oxide.  This approximation is in error because it
neglects  the  offset  in  the  zero  values  of  applied  and
oxide   voltage   brought   about   by   the   work   function
difference between gate electrode and silicon substrate,
and  the  voltages  dropped  across  the  substrate  (and  the
gate  electrode,  if  it  is  non-metallic)  when  the  capacitor
is  strongly  biased  during  breakdown  testing.    These
voltage  drops  are  made  up  of  two  components;  one
associated  with  band  bending  at  the  interfaces  with  the
oxide   that   establishes   the   high   fields   required   for
testing,  and  another  involving  additional  voltage  drops
due to series resistances that become significant at very
high   currents.      These   corrections,   which   together
normally  range  up  to  1  to  2  V  in  magnitude,  might
reasonably be neglected for samples with oxides greater
than 20-nm thick, as the correction amounted to only a
few  percent  of  the  breakdown  voltage  values.    For
thinner  oxides,  these  additional  voltage  components
must be taken into account.

10. 2.2  At zero volts applied, the offset due to the work
function     difference     and     oxide     charge     appears
predominantly  across  the  oxide.    For  setting  a  voltage

with changing

is not affected by this offset, but may be decreased
by  voltage  increases  across  the  silicon  substrate  or  the
gate electrode due to band bending and series resistance
drops.    For  a  sample  in  which  the  applied  bias  voltage
polarity   accumulates   the   substrate,   and   the   gate
electrode  is  metallic  or  of  the  opposite  conductivity
type  from  the  substrate  (for  example,  p-type  silicon
substrate  and  n+  polysilicon  gate),  these  effects  are
appreciable  only  for  very  small  and  very  large  applied
voltages.    At  low  bias,  silicon  bands  bend  until  the
surface  becomes  degenerate,  after  which  the  rate  of
band  bending  becomes  very  low.    At  high  biases,
significant  resistive  voltage  drops  may  develop  if  the
test structure design is not optimized.  Over the largest
portion  of  the  test  in  which  neither  of  these  effects  are
large,   ramp   rates   may   be   computed   assuming   that
voltage  increments  applied  to  the  device  under  test
appear   completely   across   the   oxide,   and   ∆E

Determination of Noise Threshold Current Level,
Slope Ratio Applicability, and Voltage Step Time
Variations</p><ol start="10"><li>3  Determination  of  Noise  Threshold  Current  Level
and ln J-V Slope Ratio Specification — Useable values
of  noise  threshold  current  level  and  ln  J-V  slope  ratio
depend upon properties of the test system as well as the
samples to be evaluated, and a preliminary test may be
required in order to specify them properly.  To do this,
it is necessary to store all the current-voltage data pairs
as well as the incremental voltage step time readings in
data arrays.  This is not required for performance of the
bulk  of  the  testing,  but  is  sometimes  useful  for  more
thorough analysis of the test results.  When such data is
stored,  it  is  possible  to  construct  a  figure  like  that
shown  in  Figure  2,  which  is  a  semi-logarithmic  plot  of
sample current, step time, and slope ratio versus applied
voltage.  Data given here was taken on a 3-nm oxide on
a p-type  silicon  substrate,  so  the  current  and  voltage
values are magnitudes of negative readings.  Both direct
and  Fowler-Nordheim  tunneling  components  are  seen
in the I-V data.</li><li>3.1    To  determine  the  noise  threshold  current  level,
examine the ln J-V slope ratio, shown as open triangles
in  Figure  2.    It  is  seen  to  be  quite  noisy  for  this  test
system  and  sample  up  to  a  current  level  just  below  1
nA.    This  value,  1  nA,  is  thus  a  good  choice  for  noise
threshold current level for this test.  Further analysis of
the slope ratio data shows that its maximum value in the
range  from  1  nA  up  to  catastrophic  failure  is  1.21,  so
the   standard   specified   ratio   value   of   three   (3)   is
adequate to avoid significant noise interference.</li><li>3.2    The  step  time-voltage  dependence  plotted  as
light squares in Figure 2 illustrates shortcomings in the
step    time    control    for    this    configuration    of    the
measurement  system.    A  voltage  step  time  of  0.1  s  is
specified  for  this  test  method  in  Sections  5.3  and  9.7.
Because of the high, time-dependent currents measured
below 0.5 V, there is a regime below 1 V where this is
observed,  but  most  readings  from  there  up  to  a  current
value of 0.1 μA fall in the range 0.2 to 0.4 s.  Also, for
higher   current   values,   there   are   singular   points   at
electrometer   range   changes   where   0.2-s   delays   are
encountered.      It   has   been   shown   (Klema
4
)   that
deviations  of  this  amount  do  not  have  large  effects  on
breakdown  voltage  distributions,  but  these  extended
delays  affect  total  measurement  time,  and  it  would  be
worthwhile  to  eliminate  them  if  possible.    Approaches
depend  upon  measurement  hardware  being  used,  but
trading   off   low   current   resolution   for   electrometer
autoranging  time  and  look-ahead  range  changing  code
are possibilities.</li><li>4  ln  J-V  Slope  Hard  Failure  Criterion  —  Hard
breakdown  failure  of  oxides  is  increasingly  difficult  to
detect   as   oxide   thickness   decreases   below   10   nm.
Fowler-Nordheim    emission,    the    dominant    current
transport  mechanism  for  SiO
2
films  in  this  thickness
range,   predicts   that   at   a   given   field   strength,   the
logarithmic slope of the J-V characteristic increases for
decreasing film thickness, but decreases with increasing
field  strength  for  a  given  oxide  thickness.    Thus,  a
change in ln J-V slope may be a more sensitive detector
of  failure  for  these  very  thin  films,  where  high  failure
current  density,  low  oxide  impedance  at  failure,  and
high  voltage  drops  in  series  resistances  might  lead  to
very small current changes when the oxide ruptures.</li><li>4.1    Experience  with  this  failure  criterion  for  oxide
thicknesses  ranging  down  to  3  nm  indicates  that  a
change  by  a  factor  of  3  provides  good  detection  of
failure  while  remaining  above  the  noise  level  in  the
data.      Users   may   verify   this   condition   for   their
particular  sample  and  test  conditions,  and  change  the
failure  factor  accordingly.    Any  such  change  must  be
agreed  upon  by  the  parties  to  the  test,  and  clearly
identified in the report of the data.</li><li>4.2    In  order  to  minimize  noise  in  the  calculated
values   and   optimize   the   sensitivity   of   the   failure
detection,  it  has  been  found  advisable  to  use  a  set  of
five  data  points  to  calculate  the  established  and  new
values of the ln J-V slope.  This illustrated in Figure 3,
which  shows  the  last  few  data  points  in  the  ramp
voltage test of a 50-nm oxide.  Data points are spaced at</li><li>1 MV/cm increments, as dictated by this test method.</li><li>4.3  In particular, the last five data points are labeled
(V(n), I(n))  through  (V(n  –  5),  I(n  –  5),  respectively.

10. 4.4  Testing for the failure criterion is done by taking
the  ratio  of  Equation  6  to  Equation  5.    As  can  be  seen
from Figure 3, this failure would be identified by failure
criteria  Sections  9.9.2  and  9.9.3,  as  well  as  the  slope
criterion Section 9.9.5.</p><p>Figure 3

electric   field   strength,   or   a   discontinuity   in   the

the fraction of devices reaching this criterion, the defect

RELATED INFORMATION 1
BACKGROUND OF METHOD
NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI MF1771.  It was developed during the original
development of the document.  This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot on
December 4, 2003.
R1-1  Overview
R1-1.1  This is a voltage ramp test.  It is most useful in
determining  changes  in  a  given  process.    It  is  intended
to be applied to arrays of similar capacitors on a silicon
wafer   or   group   of   wafers   representing   a   process
condition specified by the user.
R1-2  Voltage Ramp
R1-2.1    While  this  test  can,  and  might  best  be  done
using  a  true  linear  voltage  ramp,  constraints  of  the
automated   test   equipment   most   often   used   in   its
performance  lead  to  widespread  use  of  a  staircase  of
voltage  steps  to  simulate  the  ramp.    The  ramp  rate  is
specified  in  terms  of  the  rate  of  increase  of  the  oxide
electric field.  For oxides thicker than about 20 nm, the
oxide  electric  field  has  been  commonly  estimated  by
dividing the applied voltage by the oxide thickness, but
for  thinner  films,  significant  errors  may  be  introduced
by ignoring the effects of non-zero flat band voltage of
the  MOS  capacitor  and  voltages  developed  across  the
silicon  substrate  (and  the  gate  electrode  as  well,  if  it  is
polysilicon)  due  to  band  bending  and  series  resistance.
One approach to estimation of the relationship between
sample  parameters  and  oxide  field  strength  is  found  in
Section 10.2.
R1-3  Current Sampling
R1-3.1    In  order  to  provide  adequate  breakdown  field
strength  resolution,  it  is  specified  that  current  readings
be  taken  after  a  maximum  electric  field  change  of  0.1
MV/cm.    Taken  together  with  the  specified  voltage
ramp  rate,  this  leads  to  a  maximum  time  between
current  readings  of  100  ms.    In  the  case  in  which  the
test is done using a voltage staircase, this implies use of
a   100-ms   voltage   step   duration,   with   one   current
reading taken at each step.
R1-4  Failure Criteria
R1-4.1      Both   “hard”   and   “soft”   failure   criteria   are
provided for in this test methods.
R1-4.2    Techniques  for  detection  of  hard  oxide  failure
for  thin  dielectrics  may  require  high  resolution,  low
noise current-voltage data.  For this reason, hard failure
criteria  are  defined  in  two  measurement  regimes,  one
below  and  one  above  a  threshold  current  level  where
noise is reduced.  This current level is commonly in the
range  1  nA  to  0.1  μA  for  most  test  systems.    Hard
failure   criteria   below   the   noise   threshold   level   are
defined as follows:
R1-4.2.1  Current  greater  than  or  equal  to  0.98  times
the  compliance  limit  of  the  current  score  —  This
condition signals total collapse of the capacitor.
R1-4.2.2  Current  change  by  a  factor  of  1000  in  a
single voltage step — Units with gross defects failing at
low   voltages   where   currents   are   below   the   noise
threshold  commonly  fail  with  very  large  increases  in
current.
R1-4.2.3  Consecutive  current  increases  by  a  factor  of
10  in  each  of  two  voltage  steps  —  Test  capacitors  that
are initially highly conductive, as from a pinhole, often
do  not  display  destructive  breakdown,  but  rather  show
steeply  rising  diodic  leakage  currents.    This  failure
criterion is designed to identify these defective units at
low  voltage.    Above  the  noise  threshold  current  level,
the  two  criteria  above  remain  in  force,  and  two  others
are added, as follows:
R1-4.2.4  Current  change  by  a  factor  of  10  in  a  single
step   —   In   the   Fowler-Nordheim   regime,   current
changes  are  much  less  than  this  value  for  the  small
increment in oxide field associated with a single voltage
step.
R1-4.2.5  Change  in  the  logarithmic  slope  of  the  J-V
curve  by  a  factor  of  3  —  This  criterion  becomes  of
increasingly great value for oxide films thinner than 10
nm, where destructive breakdown is often accompanied
by  very  small  changes  in  current,  because  of  the  very
low  resistance  of  these  oxides  at  very  high  fields  (see
Standard 35-2).
R1-4.3    Another  parameter  associated  with  hard  failure
is  the  hard  failure  current  density,  defined  as  the  value
of  the  current  at  the  last  measurement  point  prior  to
detection  of  hard  failure,  divided  by  the  area  of  the
capacitor.
R1-4.4    Soft  failures  are  associated  with  the  passage  of
a  predetermined  current  through  the  capacitor  under
test.    This  type  of  criterion  has  been  traditionally  used,
since  in  the  past,  passage  of  any  measurable  current
through  an  oxide  was  normally  associated  with  hard
failure.    More  recently,  where  oxides  have  commonly
been  capable  of  sustaining  Fowler-Nordheim  tunneling
conduction,   use   of   such   a   criterion   yields   results
indicative of the uniformity of the samples being tested.</p><p>SEMI MF1771-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 11
As   such,   soft   failure   criteria   may   be   agreed   upon
between  users  of  this  test  method  in  order  to  meet
individual needs of the testing.  Following are examples
of commonly used criteria:
R1-4.4.1  V
crit
— The voltage associated with the noise
threshold current level.
R1-4.4.2  Vsoft  fail  =  V  at  J  =  100  mA/cm
2
—  For
many  oxides,  this  current  level  is  close  to  hard  failure,
but    avoids    the    dispersion    associated    with    high
resistance voltage drops at high breakdown currents.
R1-4.4.3  Vsoft fail = V at I = 1.5
μA — This criterion
is  widely  used  in  Japan.
3
Other  values  of  current  or
current  density  may  be  used  as  soft  failure  criteria  by
agreement of the parties to the test.</p><p>SEMI MF1771-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 12

R2-1 Proper choice and fabrication of test structures
to be used with this test method is crucial to the success
of the testing.  Because of the diverse group of intended
users,   specific   types   of   test   devices   or   fabrication
procedures  have  not  been  stipulated.    It  is  emphasized
that  planning  of  any  test  procedure  must  include  a
complete  definition  of  the  test  structures,  including
fabrication parameters such as silicon starting material,
insulator   material,   deposition   technique,   thickness,
isolation  technique  (planar,  LOCOS,  or  direct  moat),
electrode  material,  including  thickness  doping  tech-
nique  and  level,  sheet  resistance,  and  sample  geometry
(capacitor  shape  and  area).    All  these  parameters  must
be  included  in  the  completed  report  of  the  experiment.

GUIDE FOR SELECTION AND USE OF ETCHING SOLUTIONS TO
DELINEATE STRUCTURAL DEFECTS IN SILICON
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  for  publication  by  the  North
American Regional Standards Committee on April 22, 2004.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> May 2004;
to  be  published  July  2004.    Original  edition  published  by  ASTM  International  as  ASTM  F  1809-97.    Last
previous edition SEMI MF1809-02.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1    Structural  defects  formed  in  the  bulk  of  a  silicon
wafer during its growth or induced by electronic device
processing  can  affect  the  performance  of  the  circuitry
fabricated on that wafer.  These defects take the form of
dislocations,   slip,   stacking   faults,   shallow   pits,   or
precipitates.</li><li>2  The exposure of the various defects found on or in
a   silicon   wafer   is   often   the   first   critical   step   in
evaluating wafer quality or initiating failure analysis of
an  errant  device  structure.    Etching  often  accomplishes
this  task.    This  guide  provides  information  on  the
selection    and    application    of    appropriate    etching
solutions.
2  Scope</li><li>1    This  guide  covers  the  formulation,  selection,  and
use of chemical solutions developed to reveal structural
defects in silicon wafers.</li><li>2    Sample  preparation,  temperature  control,  etching
technique,  and  choice  of  etchant  are  all  key  factors  in
the  successful  use  of  an  etching  method.    This  guide
provides  information  for  several  etching  solutions  and
provides guidance for the user to select according to the
need.      Illustrations   of   results   obtained   with   these
etching solutions are provided in Figures 1–32.</li><li>3    This  guide  is  intended  for  use  with  other  practices
and  test  methods.    SEMI  MF1725  and  SEMI  MF1726
are  practices  for  analysis  of  crystallographic  perfection
of   silicon   ingots   and   wafers,   respectively,   utilizing
etching  solutions  found  in  this  guide,  and  followed  by
counting  in  accordance  with  the  test  method  SEMI
MF1810.    SEMI  MF1727  defines  the  procedures  for
oxidation   of   the   wafer   prior   to   etching,   if   that   is
required to expose the defect structures of interest.  JIS
H 0609 is a test method that covers the entire process of
determining crystalline defects in silicon wafers.</li><li>4  Both this guide and JIS H 0609 emphasize the use
of  etching  solutions  that  do  not  contain  chromic  acid,
which  is  biologically  and  ecologically  very  hazardous
(see  Section  7.6).    Because  of  the  hazardous  nature  of
chrome  containing  etchants,  the  use  of  chromic  acid
containing  etchants  is  prohibited  in  some  jurisdictions
located in various parts of the world.
NOTE 1:  See  Related  Information  1  for  a  discussion  of  the
relationships between this guide and JIS H-0609.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  Complicating factors are different for each etchant.
Research  the  choice  of  etchants  in  advance  to  ensure
the method and solution are compatible with the sample
and objectives.  Commonly encountered problems are:</li><li>1.1    Inadvertent  etching  through  the  denuded  zone  of
an  oxidized  sample  delineates  irrelevant  bulk  defects
instead of the surface oxidation induced stacking faults
(OISF) expected.</li><li>1.2      Accelerated   etching   and   etching   artifacts   can
result   from   excessive   solution   heating   during   the
etching process.</li><li>1.3        Insufficient    agitation,    bubble    formation    or
particles  in  the  etching  solution  can  generate  artifacts
on   the   silicon   surface   that   mimic   actual   defects.
Insufficient    agitation    can    alter    the    etching    rate,
increasing    or    decreasing    it    depending    upon    the
formulation.</li><li>1.4      Any   solution   in   which   the   oxidation   rate   is
greater  than  the  oxide  dissolution  rate  may  form  oxide
layers  that  slow  or  even  quench  the  etching  process.
The  presence  of  these  oxide  layers  (especially  for  n</li></ol><ul><li>and p</li><li>material)  obstructs  the  interpretation  of  etched
defects.  Before evaluation, remove any surface oxides.</li></ul><ol start="3"><li>1.5    The  wafer  surface  becomes  rougher  with  longer
etch time.  This rougher surface does not prevent evalu-
ation  under  the  microscope,  but  it  greatly  reduces  the
effectiveness of visual inspection under bright light.</li><li>1.6    Etching  solutions  can  generate  false  pits  that  are
not associated with defects.</li></ol><p>SEMI MF1809-0704 © SEMI 2003, 2004 2
3. 1.7      The   samples   must   be   free   of   work   damage,
contamination, and other complicating residues.  Clean,
specular    surfaces    are    suitable    for    metallographic
examination  and  provide  the  best  results.    Surfaces
examined should be flat with parallel faces, to simplify
microscope inspection.

work  more  effectively  with  the  aid  of  agitation.    Heat
exchangers or just the thermal mass of the solution can
control  temperature.    Large  volumes  of  acid  heat  more
slowly   and   allow   an   intrinsic   form   of   temperature
control.    To  reduce  heating  effects,  maintain  1  L  of
solution for each 1,000 cm
2
of sample surface area.
6. 1.2    Maintain  proper  environmental  controls.    Make
provisions  to  dispose  of  nitrous  oxides,  HF  fumes,  and
any  solid  wastes  evolved  whatever  system  is  chosen.
Chromium and copper-based etching solutions produce
solid  waste  and  gaseous  byproducts.    Chromium-free
etching  solutions  produce  no  measurable  solid  waste
but do generate nitrous oxides and HF fumes.
7  Reagents and Materials
7. 1  Purity  of  Reagents  —  Chemicals  shall  conform  to
the   assay   and   impurity   levels   of   Grade   1   SEMI
Specifications  where  they  exist.    Reagents  for  which
SEMI  specifications  have  not  been  developed  shall
conform  to  the  specifications  of  the  Committee  on
Analytical    Reagents    of    the    American    Chemical
Society,
3
where such specifications are available.  Other
grades  may  be  used  provided  it  is  first  ascertained  that
the  reagent  is  of  sufficiently  high  purity  to  permit  its
use without lessening the accuracy of the determination.
7. 2  Purity  of  Water  —  Reference  to  water  shall  be
understood   to   mean   Type   E-3   or   better   water   as
described in ASTM Guide D 5127.
7. 3    Volume  of  components  describes  all  solutions  in
parts  of  a  standard  assay.    The  formulas  give  solid  or
dissolved  components  in  grams  per  100  mm  of  total
solution.
7. 4      All   formulations   employ   a   Standard   Solution
Convention    (SSC)    that    specifies    each    solution
component  as  an  acceptable  assay  ±  some  tolerance.</p><p>3    Reagent  Chemicals,  American  Chemical  Society  Specifications,

Formulations of the standard assay follow this example:
A  HF/HNO
3
/Acetic  solution,  in  the  1:1:2  ratio  is  the
same  as  25%  (49%  HF)  +  25%  (70%  HNO
3</p><ul><li>50%
(glacial  acetic)  by  volume.    The  specified  chemicals
shall have the following nominal assay:
• Acetic acid, glacial &gt;99.7%
• Chromium trioxide &gt;98%
• Copper nitrate &gt;98%
• Hydrofluoric acid 49± 0.25%
• Nitric acid      70 to 71%</li></ul><ol start="7"><li>5    The  chemicals  used  in  these  etching  solutions  are
potentially harmful.  Handle and use them in a chemical
exhaust fume hood, with the utmost care.  Hydrofluoric
acid solutions are particularly hazardous.</li><li>6    Release  of  chromic  acid  or  solutions  of  chromic
acid   into   domestic   sewer   systems   is   usually   not
allowed.      Chromates   are   extreme   biological   and
ecological hazards.  Chromic acid is a strong oxidizing
agent  and  should  not  contact  organic  solvents  or  other
easily oxidized materials.</li><li>7    Safety  or  protective  gear  should  be  worn  while
handling   these   acid   solutions   or   their   components.
Safety requirements vary, but essential items are plastic
gloves, safety glasses, face shield, acid gown, and shoe
covers.    The  handling  of  large  quantities  of  powdered
chromic acid may require a respirator or other breathing
apparatus.
8  Procedure</li><li>1  Selection of Etching Solutions</li><li>1.1    The  following  tables  show  two  broad  categories
of solutions.  The first group in Tables 1 and 3 includes
only  chromium-free  etching  solutions.    Although  uses
may  be  limited,  these  solutions  should  be  considered
whenever  appropriate.    The  second  group  in  Tables  2
and  4  includes  only  solutions  that  contain  chromium
compounds.      These   do   well   for   their   intended
applications,    but    they    can    be    harmful    to    the
environment.    Use  these  highly  contaminated  etching
solutions with caution.  Release into the environment of
hexavalent chromium waste is a recognized hazard (see
Section 7.6).  Exposure can cause cancer.
NOTE 2:  Copper-3  solution  is  also  identified  as  “MEMC
etch” in referenced publications.
NOTE  3:    Sopori  and  Sato  etches  have  been  suggested  for
inclusion in Tables 2 and 4, and these solutions may be added
when  solution  information  and  pictures  become  available
from    sponsors    (see    Related    Information    2    for    the
methodology  by  which  new  solutions  can  be  added  to  the
guide).</li><li>1.2    Tables  1  and  2  list  the  figure  numbers  of  the
etched   defect   examples   for   these   etching   solutions
together with their etching rates.</li><li>1.3    Tables  3  and  4  classify  the  suitability  of  each
listed  etching  solution  for  the  various  applications.    In
the tables,
• A = Excellent,
• B = Good,
• C = Acceptable, and
• D = Unacceptable.
Each  solution  has  advantages  and  disadvantages  and
this  guide  does  not  endorse  one  in  favor  of  another.
Selection  of  an  etchant  solution  should  be  based  upon
etch  rate,  etchant  life,  solution  heating,  environmental
harm, ease of interpretation, and range of use.</li><li>1.4  Investigate    local environmental    and    safety
requirements   before   selecting   an   etchant   solution.
Identify  the  sample  orientation,  type,  resistivity  level,
and  primary  defects  of  interest;  this  information  helps
the  user  rank  the  various  possible  solutions  and  then
select the most appropriate choice.</li><li>1.4.1    Although  this  guide  does  not  require  a  specific
solution,  it  is  highly  recommended  that  chromium-free
etching solutions should be used whenever possible, for
environmental and biological reasons.</li><li>2  Sample Preparation</li><li>2.1    Most  silicon  samples  have  residual  oxide  on  the
surface,    either    thermally    grown    as    part    of    the
fabrication   process   or   occurring   naturally   due   to
exposure to air.</li><li>2.2    Immediately  before  defect  etching,  submerge  the
sample  in  concentrated  HF  solution  for  1  min  or  until
the  surface  becomes  hydrophobic  to  remove  surface
oxide layers.</li><li>2.3    Rinse  and  hold  the  samples  in  deionized  water
until transferred to the etching solution.</li><li>3  Defect Etching</li><li>3.1    No  standard  design  for  etching  systems  exists
(see Section 6.1).  In general, the procedures defined for
the  etching  system  available  to  the  user  of  this  guide
must  be  followed.    A  simple  system  for  manual  use  is
as follows:</li><li>3.1.1  Place the specimen in the bottom of a HF-proof
beaker with the surface to be inspected facing upward.</li><li>3.1.2  Pour in sufficient etchant to cover the specimen
with about 2 cm of solution.</li></ol><p>SEMI MF1809-0704 © SEMI 2003, 2004 4
8. 3.1.3  Maintain 1 L of solution for each 1,000 cm
2
of
sample surface area to control temperature effects.
8. 3.1.4  Etch the specimen according to the removal and
agitation  restriction  provided  in  the  selection  tables.
The time of the etching process may be derived by use
of the suggested etching depth for specific defects.
NOTE   4:      Suggested   removals   may   be   found   in   SEMI
MF1725 and SEMI MF1726.
8. 3.1.5  If the etching solution must be contained at the
point  of  use,  decant  the  solution  into  a  container  for
(hazardous)  waste  and  rinse  the  specimen  thoroughly
with  running  water.    If  the  solution  is  chromium-free
and  is  not  contained  for  disposal,  the  solution  may  be
quenched with water and thoroughly rinsed in the same
beaker.
8. 3.1.6    Blow  the  specimen  dry  with  filtered,  organic
free nitrogen.
8. 3.1.7    Store  the  specimen  in  a  clean  container  until
inspected.

RELATED INFORMATION 1
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SEMI MF1809 AND JIS H-0609
NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI MF1809.  It was developed by the task
force during the revision of the document in 2003.  This related information was approved for publication
by full letter ballot on April 22, 2004.
R1-1    Both  this  guide  and  test  method  JIS  H-0609
identify   etching   solutions   for   use   in   delineating
structural  defects  in  silicon.    As  indicated  in  2.3,  this
guide  is  intended  to  be  used  with  other  practices  and
test   methods   while   JIS   H-0609   covers   the   entire
delineation and counting process.
R1-2    JIS  H-0609  contains  sections  on  terminology,
sample  preparation,  including  thermal  oxidation,  selec-
tion of etchants, etching procedures, measurement loca-
tions, and measurement methods for various crystalline
defects.
R1-2.1    The  definitions  of  the  various  crystal  defects
are  generally  similar  to  those  in  SEMI  MF1241  with
only minor differences in emphasis.
R1-2.2  Sample  preparation and  etching  procedures  are
similar  in  most  respects  to  the  procedures  in  SEMI
MF1725,  SEMI  MF1726,  and  (for  thermal  oxidation)
SEMI  MF1727.    The  minor  differences  in  definitions
are not considered to be technically significant.
R1-2.3    JIS  H-0609  covers  only  non-chromic  etching
solutions  that  differ  from  those  covered  in  this  guide.
Tables   R1-1   and   R1-2   list   the   etching   solutions
discussed  in  JIS  H-0609.    Detailed  discussions  of  the
suitability    of    the    various    etching    solutions    and
microphotographs    of    exposed    crystal    defects    are
provided  in  JIS  H-0609,  similarly  to  the  manner  in
which  similar  information  is  provided  in  this  guide.
Although JIS H-0609 does not cover the use of chrome-
containing   etching   solutions,   it   does   contain   com-
parisons  with  the  etch  rates  of  several  chrome-con-
taining  etching  solutions,  including  Secco,  Wright,  and
Sirtl   etches   (see   Section   9   for   references   to   these
etching solutions).
R1-2.4  JIS  H-0609  covers a  variety  of  different  mea-
suring  locations  and  counting  procedures  for  various
different  crystal  defects,  unlike  SEMI  MF1810,  which
describes  only  a  method  for  counting  etch  pits  in  a
specified  pattern.    Visual  inspection  of  some  defect
types  is  recommended  by  JIS  H-0609;  such  visual
inspection is also covered in SEMI MF523.  JIS H-0609
includes  a  discussion  of  observation  of  denuded  zone,
but  because  of  the  variety  of  technologies  in  place  for
this  aspect,  no  standardized  measurement  method  is
defined.

TEST METHOD FOR COUNTING PREFERENTIALLY ETCHED OR
DECORATED SURFACE DEFECTS IN SILICON WAFERS
This  test  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the   North   American   Regional   Standards   Committee   on   December   4,   2003.      Initially   available   at
<a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> February 2004; to be published March 2004.  Originally published by ASTM International as
ASTM F 1810-97.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1810-97 (Reapproved 2002).
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1    Defects  on  or  in  silicon  wafers  may  adversely
affect device performance and yield.</li><li>2    Crystal  defect  analysis  is  a  useful  technique  in
troubleshooting  device  process  problems.  The  type,
location,  and  density  of  defects  counted  by  this  test
method  may  be  related  to  the  crystal  growth  process,
surface  preparation,  contamination,  or  thermal  history
of the wafer.</li><li>3    This  test  method  is  suitable  for  acceptance  testing
when used with referenced standards.
2  Scope</li><li>1    This  test  method  describes  the  technique  to  count
the  density  of  surface  defects  in  silicon  wafers  by
microscopic analysis.
NOTE  1:    Practical  use  of  a  defect  counting  method  requires
an  assumption  be  made  that  defects  are  randomly  distributed
on the surface. If this assumption is not met, the accuracy and
precision of this test method will be diminished.</li><li>2      Application   of   this   test   method   is   limited   to
specimens  that  have  discrete,  identifiable  artifacts  on
the surface of the silicon sample.  Typical samples have
been  preferentially  etched  according  to  SEMI  MF1809
or  epitaxially  deposited,  forming  defects  in  a  silicon
layer structure.</li><li>3    Wafer  thickness  and  diameter  for  this  test  method
is   limited   only   by   the   range   of   microscope   stage
motions available.</li><li>4    This  test  method  is  applicable  to  silicon  wafers
with defect density between 0.01 and 10,000 defects per
cm
2
.
NOTE  2:    The  commercially  significant  defect  density  range
is  between  0.01  to  10  defects  per  cm
2
,  but  this  test  method
extends to higher defect levels due to the improved statistical
sampling obtained with higher counts.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1      Improper   identification   of   defects   is   possible
during the counting process.</li><li>1.1          Contamination     not     removed     by     cleaning
procedures   or   deposited   following   cleaning,   may
become visible after preferential etching.</li><li>1.2      Insufficient   agitation   during   the   preferential
etching   process   may   cause   artifacts   that   may   be
mistaken as crystallographic defects.</li><li>2    The  accuracy  of  the  defect  density  calculation  is
directly   affected   by   calibration   of   the   area   of   the
microscope field of view.</li><li>3    The  defect  density  determined  by  this  test  method
requires   an   assumption   be   made   that   defects   are
randomly   distributed   on   the   surface.      Nonuniform
patterns of defects alter the defect density measurement
by their size and location.</li><li>4  Multiple scan patterns intersect at the center of the
wafer.  If a defect is found at this single, common point,
it   is   counted   more   than   once   and   thus   alters   the
accuracy of the count.

cited shall be the latest published versions.
5  Terminology
5. 1    Definitions  of  terms  related  to  silicon  technology
are found in SEMI M1 and SEMI MF1241.
6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1    Samples  for  this  test  are  selected  and  prepared  in
accordance  with  SEMI  MF1725,  SEMI  MF1726  or
SEMI  MF1727.    As  indicated  in  these  practices,  the
defect  to  be  analyzed  is  exposed  using  one  of  the
specific etching solutions listed in SEMI MF1809.
6. 2  The wafer is aligned on a microscope stage.
6. 3      It   is   then   inspected   according   to   predefined
inspection pattern.
6. 3.1  The basic inspection pattern is a single scan along
a wafer diameter.  The starting and ending points of the
scan  pattern  are  5  mm  from  the  edges  of  the  wafer.
Figure  1  represents  the  characteristics  of  the  basic
pattern.
6. 3.2      The   complete   inspection   pattern   of   this   test
method is based upon the combination of four separate
basic scans across different diameters.
6. 4    Finally,  specific  defects  distinguished  by  shape  or
size are counted.
7  Apparatus
7. 1  Nonmetallic  Vacuum  Pickup  Tool  —  Of  suitable
material  such  as  quartz  or  TFE-fluorocarbon.    The
pickup  tool  shall  be  constructed  so  that  no  metal  can
contact the specimen wafer.
7. 2  Optical  Microscope  —  Equipped  with  interference
contrast attachment.
NOTE 3:  Nomarski  differential interference  contrast  is  an
example of interference contrast.
7. 2.1  Eyepiece  and  Objective  Lens  —  In  combination
shall give a magnification range of approximately 100×
to 400× magnification of the specimen.  The dimension
of  the  field  of  view  at  each  magnification  option  is
calibrated to allow defect density calculations.</p><p>NOTE: Begin scan 5 mm from the edge.

9  Procedure</li><li>1  Four Scan Inspection Pattern</li><li>1.1    Place  the  specimen  wafer  onto  the  microscope
inspection  stage.    Handle  wafers  only  with  a  clean
nonmetallic  vacuum  pickup  tool  to  avoid  scratching  or
contaminating the surface.</li><li>1.2      Place   the   specimen   such   that   a   single   linear
motion  of  the  stage  (either  x  or  y)  allows  counting  of
defects  contained  in  the  field  of  view  along  the  path
labeled AB in Figure 1.  Points A and B are 5 mm from
the  wafer  edge  and  the  line  AB  is  rotated  45°  from  the
location   of   the   major   orientation   flat   or   notch.
Alternative   edge   exclusion   positions   are   acceptable
with the agreement of the parties involved.</li><li>1.3    Scan  the  path  and  record  the  classification  and
numbers of the defects observed during the scan.  Refer
to descriptions and pictures in SEMI MF1809.</li><li>1.4      Rotate   the   wafer   by   45°   clockwise   on   the
microscope   stage   and   repeat   Section   9.1.3   for   the
second scan.  Refer to Figure 2 for improved definition
of the scan pattern.</li><li>1.5      Rotate   the   wafer   by   45°   clockwise   on   the
microscope  stage  and  repeat  Section  9.1.3  for  the  third
scan.</li><li>1.6      Rotate   the   wafer   by   45°   clockwise   on   the
microscope stage and repeat Section 9.1.3 for the fourth
scan.</li></ol><p>SEMI MF1810-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 3</p><p>Figure 2

The density is the defect count divided by the total area.
NOTE  4:    When  a  scan  intersects  a  flat,  notch  or  laser  mark,
the total area must be adjusted according to the reduced length
of  the  affected  scans.    Failure  to  adjust  the  area  results  in
inaccuracy.

classification.
11  Precision and Bias</p></li><li><p>1  Precision —  The  multi  laboratory  precision  of
this  test  method  was  established  through  a  round-robin
experiment.        Seven    (7)    wafers    with    randomly
distributed  oxidation  induced  stacking  faults  (OISFs)
were  analyzed  by  sixteen  (16)  laboratories  over  eleven
(11)  diameter  scans.    Repeatability  and  reproducibility
of  this  test  method  were  calculated  using  two  sets  of
four   scan   measurements   from   each   laboratory   and
wafer.    The  wafer  samples  were  prepared  according  to
SEMI   MF1727   and   etched   with   Wright   Etch   in
accordance with SEMI MF1809.</p></li><li><p>1.1  Repeatability —  The  method  repeatability  is
equal   to   2.8   times   the   within-laboratory   standard
deviation or 5.22 defects/cm
2
.  Repeatability contributes</p></li><li><p>81%  of  the  total  variation.    The  variability  of  the
measurement   is   sample   dependent;   assumptions   of
random  OISF  location  were  described  as  a  limitation
(see Section 3.3).</p></li><li><p>1.2  Reproducibility —  The  method  reproducibility
is  equal  to  2.8  times  the  between-laboratory  standard
deviation     or     9.31     defects/cm
2
.     Reproducibility
contributes 75.73% of the total variation.
NOTE    5:        Additional    analysis    is    presented    in    Related
Information 1.  A study of two repetitions of this test method
was  extracted  from  the  existing,  multiple  scan  data  measured
at each laboratory.</p></li><li><p>1.3  The  wafers  exhibited single  diameter  scans  that
ranged   from   0   to   13   defects/cm
2
while   the   grand
average  of  all  measurements  for  each  wafer  yielded
densities  of  0.21  to  3.60  defects/cm
2
.    The  range  in
measurement  density  is  related  to  differences  between
laboratories and local variation of the defect density on
the wafer itself.</p></li><li><p>1.4    Ten  separate  diameters  were  measured  on  each
of  7  wafers  by  16  laboratories.    The  total  number  of
scans  for  each  sample  was  160.    Table  1  shows  the
sample  dependence  of  the  results  with  the  standard
deviation  versus  mean  OISF  count  for  ten  independent
scans.
