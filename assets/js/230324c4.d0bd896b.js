Also, as stated in the\nSEMI M20 standard, an orientation of \u201c0\u201d is for a wafer\nloaded on equipment with the primary fiducial towards\nthe operator or \u201cdown\u201d.\nR1-2.2.1    Often,  no  other  information  is  required  for\nmeasurements  to  be  made  on  a  wafer.    However,  the\n\u201cM20\u201d  coordinate  system  may  not  provide  sufficient\naccuracy   to   locate   measurement   sites   on   patterned\nwafers.  This is a result of any of a number of possible\nreasons, all of which can be described as \u201cexperimental\nerrors\u201d.    For  instance,  wafers  are  not  perfectly  round,\nfiducial  dimensions  may  vary,  and  equipment  (both\nsteppers  that  place  patterns  on  wafers  and  metrology\nequipment) capabilities to determine the location of the\nwafer center and fiducial vary.\nR1-2.2.2    In  order  to  deal  with  these  errors,  metrology\nequipment  suppliers  have  developed  various  strategies,\nas   discussed   in   the   introduction   section.      Perhaps\nbecause    the    SEMI    M20    standard's    reference    to\n\u201corigins\u201d  of  \u201cother  coordinate  systems\u201d  is  in  the  same\nsentence   with   \u201creference   points\u201d,   many   suppliers\nadopted the location of one (or more) reference point(s)\nas    the    origin    for    their    pattern-based    coordinate\nsystem(s).    Without  a  common  reference  site,  multiple\ncoordinate  systems  resulted.    More  nefarious  strategies\nwere  developed  to  compensate  for  \u201cstage  errors\u201d  on\nequipment.    These  usually  entail  a  series  of  reference\npoints  required  to  \u201czero  in\u201d  on  the  measurement  site,\nand  this  made  comparison  of  locations  determined  on\ndifferent equipment next to impossible.\nR1-2.2.3      MSEM   defines   the   \u201cM20P\u201d   coordinate\nsystem  to  be  one  which  is  identical  to  the  \u201cM20\u201d\ncoordinate system, if there were no experimental errors.\nIn other words, the location of the origin and axes of the\n\u201cM20P\u201d  coordinate  system  are  offset  slightly  from  the\norigin   and   axes   of   the   \u201cM20\u201d   coordinate   system\nbecause  of  experimental  errors.    If  the  location  of\nreference  points,  called  \u201calignment  sites\u201d  in  MSEM,  is\ndefined  to  be  the  \"M20\"  coordinates  where  they  are\n\u201cexpected\u201d to be, and equipment is designed to be able\nto \u201cfind\u201d the alignment sites, given the various possible\nexperimental errors, the \u201cfound\u201d and \u201cexpected\u201d SEMI\nM20   coordinates   can   be   used   to   determine   the\n\u201cM20-to-M20P\u201d  coordinate  system  transformation,  as\nexplained in appendix 1.  Alignment site information is\nspecified  through  the  use  of  the  MSEM  data  items\nnamed  AlignList,  the  CPNAME  CP-ALIGNLIST  and,\nthe table type named  ALIGN-DEF-LIST.\nR1-2.2.4  Most metrology equipment cannot distinguish\nwhether  patterned  wafer  site  location  errors  are  due  to\nthe  wafer,  the  layout  on  the  wafer,  or  the  equipment's\nability to locate the sites.  However, information that is\navailable  through  the  use  of  patterned-wafer  alignment\nsites  can  provide  a  means  for  identifying  potential\nmetrology  equipment  problems.    For  instance,  assume\nthat the only pattern-layout location error on a wafer is\nthat  due  to  the  establishment  of  the  location  of  the\nwafer   center   and   fiducial.      For   many   users   and\nmetrology systems, this is a good assumption.  If this is\nthe  case,  then  the  MSEM  data  item  named  XlateData\ncan be used to track this error.  Although the error may\nresult  from  multiple  sources,  being  able  to  track  it  on\nvarious metrology equipment will enable users to apply\nstatistical  process  control  techniques  to  identify  the\nspecific sources.\nR1-2.2.5        Sites    specified    for    measurements    or\nadditional   alignments   may   be   found   by   metrology\nequipment   at   locations   which   deviate   from   their\nexpected  locations  through  either  pattern  layout  errors\nor  metrology  equipment  \u201cstage\u201d  errors.    Again,  in  a\ncontrolled   manufacturing   process,   these   combined\nerrors  should  be  normally  distributed,  and  non-normal\ndeviations  may  indicate  possible  metrology  equipment\nproblems.    These  types  of  errors  shall  be  reported\nthrough the use of the MSEM data item named Offset.\nR1-2.2.6      A   minimum   of   two   alignment   sites   are\nnecessary to establish an \u201cM20P\u201d coordinate system on\na  wafer.    Additional  sites  are  often  used,  as  in  the\nexample given in appendix 1.  The system supplier shall\ndocument      the      requirements      for      ALIGNLIST\ninformation,    and    detail    how    any    \u201csite-by-site\u201d\nalignment  sites  (that  is,  those  needed  to  obtain  better\nlocation  accuracy  in  the  neighborhood  of  measurement\nsite)   are   associated   with   the   specific   SITELIST\nmeasurement sites.\nR1-2.2.7    Alignment  site  location  information  may  be\neither  provided  to  or  by  equipment.    Some  equipment\nhave  the  capability  to  find  and  report  the  locations  of\n\u201creference   sites\u201d   without   prior   knowledge   of   their\nlocations on the wafer.  In this case, the equipment shall\nreport the location  of both alignment and measurement\nsites   in   \u201cM20\u201d   coordinates.      When   alignment   site\ninformation  is  provided  to  equipment  to  establish  an\n\u201cM20P\u201d coordinate, measurement site locations shall be\nreported in the \u201cM20P\u201d coordinate system.\nR1-2.2.8    MSEM  encourages  users  to  define  \u201cM20P\u201d\nlocations in reference to the user's device layout design\nwithin  an  ideal  SEMI  M20  wafer  coordinate  system.\nAn   alternative   is   to   define   \u201cM20P\u201d   locations   by\n\u201ctraining\u201d on a \u201cbenchmark\u201d system.\nR1-3    Layout  of  Rectangular  Elements  on  a  Silicon\nWafer\n\uf8e7 Equipment   shall   be   capable   of   routine,\nautomated   operation   without   needing   wafer   layout\ninformation (e.g., field or die maps).  However, having\nthe  capability  to  provide  wafer  layout  information  to"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E30.5-0302 \xa9 SEMI 2001, 200230\nmetrology equipment from the host can be desirable.  In\nsome  cases,  the  amount  of  information  required  to\ndefine    measurement    site    locations    is    less    if    a\npattern-element-based format is used.  MSEM defines a\nmeans  to  do  this  in  this  section,  if  desired,  based  on\nSEMI standard SEMI M21.\nR1-3.1    SEMI  standard  SEMI  M21,  \u201cSpecification  for\nassigning   addresses   to   rectangular   elements   in   a\nCartesian  array\u201d,  is  limited  (for  MSEM  purposes)  by\nthe   fact   that   nothing   is   specified   about   how   the\nrectangular  elements  are  located  on  the  wafer.    The\nSEMI  M21  standard  details  how  to  assign  \u201caddresses\u201d\nto elements and how to find the \u201carray center\u201d element.\nIn  this  section,  MSEM  defines  how  these  elements  are\nlocated   on   a   wafer,   using   the   data   item   named\n\u201cM21Data\u201d,   and   how   to   establish   within-element\ncoordinate systems.\nR1-3.2  There are users who want or require much more\nlayout  information  than  is  provided  for  by  SEMI  M21,\nsuch  as  within-element  structure  details  or  element\nattribute      information.      This      additional      layout\ninformation  is  beyond  the  scope  of  MSEM,  since  it  is\nconsidered  to  be  information  which  only  is  needed  to\naid operator-interactive use of metrology systems.\nR1-3.3    MSEM  \u201cM21\u201d  Layout\n\uf8e7 The  first  pattern\nelement   layout   issue   to   be   addressed   is   that   of\ndetermining   which   SEMI   M21   elements   are   to   be\nincluded  in  the  MSEM  \u201cM21\u201d  layout.    MSEM  defines\nthe  \u201cM21\u201d  layout  to  include  all  elements  which  either\nwholly  or  partially  are  within  the  circumference  of  the\nwafer. Thus the MSEM \u201cM21\u201d element layout does not\ncorrespond  to  the  pattern  layout  exactly,  since  some\n\u201cM21\u201d elements may not contain patterns.\nR1-3.4    The  second  layout  issue  is  that  of  how  best  to\nspecify the element locations on the wafer.  The MSEM\napproach  is  to  specify  the  \u201cM20P\u201d  coordinate  for  the\nlower  left  corner  of  the  minimum  number  of  elements\nneeded  to  define  the  layout,  along  with  the  element\naddresses.    For  a  non-tiled  layout,  the  location  of  a\nsingle  element  is  sufficient  to  establish  the  \u201cM21\u201d\nlayout.  For tiled layouts, the location of one element in\neach row or column is required.  Note that the location\nof  the  lower  left  corner  of  an  element  may  be  outside\nthe circumference of the wafer.\nR1-3.5      Layout   definition   is   supported   only   for\nhost-to-equipment    communications.        The    user    is\nresponsible  for  ensuring  that  the  element  addresses\nprovided  to  the  equipment  agree  with  the  SEMI  M21\nspecification.  The equipment need not check this, other\nthan  to  ensure  that  there  are  not  conflicts  within  the\nprovided  layout,  and  shall  report  results  with  element\naddresses as provided by the user.\nR1-3.6  M21 layouts are established within the \u201cM20P\u201d\ncoordinate  system,  and  need  not  require  any  additional\nalignment  site  data  than  is  needed  to  establish  the\n\u201cM20P\u201d coordinate system.  However, as with \u201cM20P\u201d,\nadditional   alignment   may   be   necessary   because   of\nerrors  in  either  the  pattern  layout  or  the  equipment's\nability  to  locate  features.    OFFSET  shall  be  used  to\nreport  the  location  corrections  that  result  from  any\nwithin-element alignments.\nR1-3.7    MSEM  provides  a  means  for  element-based\ncoordinate   systems,   if   required.   This   capability   is\nprovided  by  the  option  of  specifying  \u201cM21\u201d  as  the\ncoordinate    system    for    ALIGN-DEF-DATA    and\nSITEDEFDATA    items.        For    element-based    site\nlocations,  MSEM  requires  that  SEMI  M21  element\ncoordinate  systems  have  x  and  y  axes  parallel  to  the\nrespective   M20-based   coordinate   system   axes,   with\ntheir origins at the lower left corner of each element.\nR1-4  An Example of How an M20P Coordinate System\nis Established on a Silicon Wafer\nR1-4.1  The following example is fairly basic.  For this\nexample,  the  equipment  does  M20P  alignment  via  a\nrepeated  two-step  process.    The  first  step  is  done  at  a\nlow resolution, the second at a high resolution, and the\nprocess is done at two positions on the wafer.\nR1-4.2    The  equipment  documentation  states  that  4\nalignment  sites  are  required.    These  are  defined  to  the\nequipment   via   the   table   type   named   ALIGN-DEF-\nLIST,  as  detailed  below.    The  order  of  the  sites  in\nALIGN-DEF-LIST is not important.  The sites are then\nselected       via       the       CPNAME       item       named\nCP-ALIGNLIST, which is included in the PP-SELECT\ncommand.        The    order    of    the    sites    listed    in\nCP-ALIGNLIST is important, and is as specified in the\nequipment's   documentation.      The   first   site   is   the\nalignment  site  for  the  first  low  resolution  site,  the\nsecond item is for the first high resolution site, the third\nitem is the second low resolution site, and the fourth is\nthe second high resolution site."),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E30.5-0302 \xa9 SEMI 2001, 200231\nTable R1-1 ALIGN-DEF-LIST\nAlign-NameCoordxCoordyCoordsysAlign- Attribute(n)\nCoarse1-60000-200M20P\nFine1-60020-205M20P\nCoarse 2 60000 200M20P\nFine259980195M20P\nR1-4.3  ALIGN-DEF-LIST\nL,4"),(0,r.yg)("ol",null,(0,r.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Coarse1"),(0,r.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Fine1"),(0,r.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Coarse 2"),(0,r.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Fine2\nR1-4.4  Using this information, the equipment will go to the nominal M20 location for Coarse, then \u201cfind\u201d where it\nactually is.

The\ntransfer  of  a  single  transfer  object  from  Equipment  A\ndirectly  to  Equipment  B  where  only  one  change  in\nownership occurs.\nCompound  Transfer  \u2014  Combination  of  two  or  more\natomic  transfers  executed  sequentially  or  concurrently\nto achieve a single goal (e.g., exchange carriers or move\na  carrier  between  process  machines  using  a  transfer\nagent).\nDynamic Port \u2014 (Opposite of Static Port) A port with\nassociated  mechanisms  capable  of  assisting  with  the\nphysical movement of a transfer object or of interfering\nwith  the  transfer  of  an  object  during  the  transfer.  Such\nmechanisms  may  include  doors,  elevators,  and  robot\narms.

The\nequipment    referenced    in    this    document    include\nmachines used for processing, transport, and/or storage\nof material (see definition of material).\nHost  \u2014  In  the  context  of  material  movement,  the  host\nis  an  entity,  generally  separate  from  either  transfer\npartner,  which  coordinates  and  supervises  a  transfer\njob.\nInteractive   Transfer   \u2014   A   transfer   in   which   both\npartners are active and must interact in the performance\nof the transfer.\nInterfering  \u2014  A  dynamic  port  is  interfering  when  any\nof its associated mechanisms are positioned where they\nare capable of physically obstructing the transfer.\nMacro   Level   \u2014   Level   of   material   movement   that\ninvolves  coordination  by  the  host  but  may  not  require\nknowledge  of  the  physical  process  used  to  accomplish\nthe material transfer.\nMaterial \u2014 A term used interchangeably with \u201ctransfer\nobject\u201d   to   refer   to   discrete   objects   which   may   be\ntransferred  to  and  from  equipment.  This  may  include\nproduct,  carriers,  reusable  fixtures,  etc.  See  transfer\nobject definition.\nMaterial Location  \u2014  A physical position on a piece of\nequipment at which a transfer object may reside. Many\nmaterial  locations  may  be  accessed  directly  through  a\nport,  but  this  is  not  a  requirement.  Some  material\nlocations   internal   to   the   equipment   may   not   be\naccessible by a transfer agent.\nMessage  Service/Service  \u2014  A  service  (or  a  message\nservice)  represents  a  set  of  functions  offered  to  a  user\nby  a  provider.

The  primitives  for  a  response  are  called\nthe  response  and  the  confirmation.  A  service  excludes\ndefinition of message structure and protocol.\nMicro    Level    \u2014    Level    of    material    movement\ncharacterized by peer-to-peer interaction of the transfer\npartners   to   achieve   synchronization   of   the   detailed\nmechanical steps of material transfer."),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E32-0997 \xa9 SEMI 1994, 19976\nObject  \u2014  Webster's  defines  an  object  as  \u201csomething\nperceptible.\u201d  In  the  software  world,  an  object  is  a\ncombination  of  attributes  and  behavior.

They are based\non  a  flow  of  material  through  an  equipment  rather  than  the\nmovement  of  transfer  objects  (which  may  be  carriers  rather\nthan  the  material  itself).  Transfer  objects  may  have  to  be\nmoved into and out of both these types of ports.\nReceiving  Port  \u2014  For  a  specific  transfer,  the  port  into\nwhich a transfer object is to be placed.\nSending  Port  \u2014  For  a  specific  transfer,  the  port  from\nwhich a transfer object is to be removed.\nStatic Port \u2014 (Opposite of Dynamic Port) A port with\nno   associated   mechanisms   capable   of   assisting   or\ninterfering  with  the  transfer  of  an  object.  A  transfer\npartner  utilizing  a  static  port  for  the  transfer  shall\nalways be passive.\nTransfer  Agent  \u2014  An  equipment  specialized  to  the\ntransport  of  material  from  one  equipment  (or  storage\narea) to another.\nTransfer   Envelope   \u2014   The   three-dimensional   space\noccupied  during  the  transfer  by  the  transfer  object  and\nall  associated  transfer  mechanisms  of  both  transfer\npartners.   This   defines   the   space   in   which   transfer\nactivity  occurs  and  in  which  the  potential  for  physical\ninterference with the transfer exists.\nTransfer   Job      \u2014      The   set   of   atomic   transfers\nconstructed   by   the   host   to   accomplish   a   cohesive\nmaterial   movement   objective.

The\ntransfer     system     controller     presents     a     single\ncommunications  interface  to  its  host  representing  these\nmultiple agents.\n3  Overview\nMaterial  movement  is  concerned  with  the  transfer  of\nobjects  (WIP,  tools,  expendable  materials,  etc.)  among\nprocess equipment, buffers, and storage facilities. These\nobjects may optionally be contained (singly or in mass)\nwithin a carrier. Empty carriers may also be considered\nobjects.\nMaterial movement may include several different types\nof entities. These are divided into two classes: Host and\nEquipment.  The  host  is  the  supervising  entity  which\norganizes   the   transfer   and   gives   the   appropriated\ninstructions to each equipment involved. An equipment\nphysically participates in the transfer, either sending or\nreceiving  material.  The  class  of  equipment  may  be\ndivided into three types:\nProcess   Equipment   \u2014   Equipment   which   performs\nvalue-added  operations  on  the  factories\u2019  products.  This\nincludes those equipment which physically changes the\nproduct and those which measure/test the product.\nTransfer  Agent  \u2014  A  type  of  equipment  specialized  to\nthe  movement  of  transfer  objects  from  place  to  place\nwithin a factory. Transfer agents themselves may be of\ndifferent       types       and       with       widely-differing"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E32-0997 \xa9 SEMI 1994, 19977\ncharacteristics.  These  may  be  fixed-arm  robots,  robot\narms  on  a  fixed  track,  AGVs  with  or  without  robot\narms, overhead gantries, cars on tracks, or even transfer\nsystems  containing  a  heterogenous  collection  of  other\ntransfer agents. Humans also may act as transfer agents.\nStorage  Areas  \u2014  A  type  of  equipment  used  to  hold\ntransfer  objects  pending  further  processing  (if  product)\nor  use  (if  reticles,  etc.)  within  the  factory.  A  storage\narea may be as sophisticated as an automated WIP Bin\nor as simple as a shelf.\n3. 1  Macro and Micro Levels \u2014 M aterial movement is\nseparated  into  two  levels.  The  more  abstract  level,\ncalled   the   macro   level,   consists   of   all   message\ntransactions used by the host in its coordination role. At\nthe macro level, the host is responsible for determining\nwhat  material  is  to  be  moved,  from  where,  to  where,\nand when. The host shall provide each party involved in\na transfer job with the information necessary to perform\nits part of that transfer job.\nA  transfer  job  may  be  composed  of  multiple  handoff\noperations, or \u201cAtomic Transfers.\u201d Each atomic transfer\ninvolves    only    two    equipment,    termed    \u201cTransfer\nPartners.\u201d  In  order  to  perform  this  handoff  operation,\nthe    transfer    partners    must    achieve    a    level    of\nsynchronization.   The   communications   between   the\ntransfer  partners  is  called  the  micro  level  of  material\nmovement.\nThese  communications  occur  between  the  two  partners\nin a \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d fashion. Micro communications may\nbe  implemented  via  a  direct  equipment-to-equipment\nconnection\n2"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"or by passing messages indirectly through\nthe host.\nThe  macro  and  micro  levels  are  designed  to  work\ntogether  so  that  the  host  may  initiate  the  transfer  and\nthen  allow  the  transfer  partners  to  perform  the  job\ninteractively.  However,  these  two  levels  may  be  used\nseparately.   For   instance,   the   macro   level   may   be\ncombined with functionality of the SEMI E23 (Cassette\nTransfer  Parallel  I/O  Interface  Specification)  standard.\nAdditionally, under some conditions there may not be a\nhost   coordinating   the   transfer.   Instead,   one   of   the\ntransfer  partners  might  be  in  control.  Here,  the  micro\nlevel  may  still  be  used  to  accomplish  the  transfer.  The\ncontrolling   partner   would   perform   the   coordination\nfunctions normally in the domain of the host.\nIn this standard, the macro and micro levels are defined\nseparately,   each   with   its   concepts,   behavior,   and\nservices."),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"2 In this context, connection is intended to mean a direct logical link,\nrather than a hard wired connection.\n3. 2  Ports and Locations \u2014 A port  may be considered\na  point  of  entry  to  the  equipment.  A  location  is  a\nreceptacle for a transfer object. At any time, a port shall\nbe  linked  to  at  least  one  location.  However,  some\nlocations may be internal and never be linked to a port.\nFor  \u201ctypical\u201d  factory  equipment,  there  is  a  permanent\none-to-one   correspondence   between   the   port   and   a\nlocation.  However,  not  all  semiconductor  equipment\nfollows this pattern. For instance, the port on a transfer\nagent  that  includes  a  robot  arm  and  multiple  on-board\nstorage  locations  is  actually  the  gripper  on  the  robot\narm.  The  gripper  is  also  a  location.  In  another  case,  a\nport  may  actually  feed  a  rotating  carousel  containing\nmultiple  locations.  The  port  in  this  example  would  be\nthe  access  door  to  the  carousel.  The  location  linked  to\nthis type of port would be the one in front of the door at\ntransfer  time  and  would  change  whenever  the  carousel\nrotates.  Figure  3.1  helps  to  illustrate  the  difference\nbetween ports and locations.\nFigure 3.1\nPort vs. Location"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E32-0997 \xa9 SEMI 1994, 19978\nIt  is  important  to  note  that  the  attribute  of  \u201cfull\u201d  or\n\u201cempty\u201d belongs to a location rather than a port. A port\nthat  has  just  received  a  transfer  object  may  be  able  to\nreceive  another  immediately.  Likewise,  a  port  that  has\nsent a transfer object may have more material available\nto send.\n3. 3    Compliance   \u2014   Compliance   to    this   standard\nincludes  adherance  to  all  stated  requirements  in  this\ndocument.  This  includes  all  defined  messages  services,\nstate models, and communications scenarios.\nThis standard may be divided into two parts:\n\u2022 Material Movement Macro Level, and\n\u2022 Material Movement Micro Level.\nAn  equipment  may  be  compliant  to  one  of  these  parts\nwithout  the  other.  Details  of  compliance  to  each  of\nthese parts are defined in the body of this document.\n4  Macro Level\nThe  set  of  host<->equipment  interactions  needed  to\nfacilitate  a  transfer  is  called  the  macro  level.  These\ninteractions concentrate on the definition of the transfer\nspecification,   and   leave   the   details   of   the   physical\ntransfer to the micro level interactions.\nIn  addition  to  the  services  defined  in  Section  4,  the\nGetAttr  service  defined  by  SEMI  E39,  Object  Services\nStandard,  is  supported  by  this  standard.  The  definition\nfor the GetAttribute service defined in Section 4 will be\nremoved and no longer supported in 1998.\n4. 1   Macro  Level  Concepts  \u2014  The   macro  level  is\ndesigned with the intent of creating a widely applicable,\nhost  coordinated  material  movement  capability.  The\nresult   is   a   sequence   of   interactions   from   host   to\nequipment  that  is  used  to  accomplish  the  coordination\nof  material  movement  required  on  the  manufacturing\nfloor.\nThe  elements  of  material  movement  common  to  all\ntransfers make up the framework. Other elements which\ndiffer    from    implementation\u2013to\u2013implementation    are\npushed,  as  much  as  possible,  into  the  data  portions  of\ncommunications.  The  common  elements  identified  are\nas follows:\n\u2022 The host is responsible for designating the transfer\npartners which are compatible for transfer.\n\u2022 The host must supply the necessary information for\nthe transfer to each partner.\n\u2022 Once  transfer  is  defined,  the  responsibility  moves\nto  the  transfer  partners,  especially  the  designated\n\u201cprimary\u201d  partner\n3"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,".

This    has    no    intrinsic\nrelationship to other details, such as the selection of\nthe primary transfer partner.\n\u2022   Whether  a  transfer  partner  is  passive  or  actively\nparticipates  in  the  transfer.  This  also  becomes  a\ndata issue.\n\u2022 The method (mechanism) of an interactive transfer.\nThis  may  vary  depending  on  the  transfer  partners'\ncapabilities  and  system  design.  Interaction  with\ndifferent  partners  may  require  different  methods.\nTransfer  recipes  containing  this  information  may\nbe  specified  by  the  host  as  a  part  of  the  transfer\nspecification.\nThe host must have some knowledge of the capabilities\nof   the   transfer   partners   it   designates   to   perform   a\ntransfer.    It    must    understand    which    partners    are\ncompatible. If compatible, it must know the proper role\nfor each partner of the transfer and what methods must\nbe used. If an interactive transfer is warranted, the host\nmust  be  able  to  determine  which  partner  should  be  the\nprimary.    Definition    of    the    mechanism    for    such\ndeterminations  by  the  host  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this\ndocument.\n4. 1.1  Macro Level Definitions\nAbort  \u2014  The  immediate  termination  of  an  active  job,\nincluding  a  complete  stop  of  all  transfer  job-related\nmovement.  An  abort  may  be  initiated  by  the  host  (and\noptionally  by  the  operator).  An  abort  by  the  host  is\ndirected  at  a  transfer  job,  not  at  an  individual  atomic\ntransfer. When told to abort, a transfer job shall, in turn,\nabort   its   atomic   transfers.   The   abort   command   is\nintended to be used only in situations where there is risk\nof material or hardware damage.\nAllocate   \u2014   The   formal   reservation   of   an   entity's\nresources  for  a  specific  purpose.  In  this  document,  it\nrefers to the reservation of an equipment's resources for\na  specific  transfer  job  or  atomic  transfer.  Allocation  of\nneeded  material  locations  for  a  transfer  job  occurs  just\nprior to that job becoming active. Allocation of required\nport-related resources occurs just prior to the start of an\natomic transfer.\nCommit  \u2014  The  commit  by  the  equipment  indicates  a\nreadiness  to  begin  the  actual  material  handoff.  The"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E32-0997 \xa9 SEMI 1994, 19979\ncommit  follows  any  setup  activities  and  coincides  with\nentry  to  the  HANDOFF  state.  For  example,  an  AGV\nmay not be allowed to commit until it has moved to the\npoint of transfer. The point at which an equipment may\ncommit   is   equipment-specific.   There   is   a   separate\ncommit for each atomic transfer in a job.\nDeallocate \u2014 The release of allocated resources. In this\ndocument,  it  refers  to  the  equipment's  release  of  the\nresources  reserved  for  a  transfer  job  or  an  atomic\ntransfer.\nPort  Resources  \u2014   Equipment-controlled  mechanisms\nthat  serve  a  port.  An  example  of  a  port  resource  is  a\ncassette   indexer   that   changes   to   elevation   of   the\nmaterial  location.  A  port  resource  is  available  only  to\nthe atomic transfer that has allocated that port.\nPrimary  Transfer  Partner  \u2014  The  partner  that  controls\nthe  micro  level  transfer  and  that  would  receive  the\noptional  host  command  to  initiate  the  transfer.  The\nprimary   transfer   partner   shall   always   be   an   active\npartner  for  the  transfer.  For  an  interactive  transfer,  the\nnature  of  the  transfer  partners  may  determine  which\nshould be primary. Otherwise, the host may choose.\nRestore  \u2014  An  operation  associated  with  a  transfer  job\nwhich  causes  the  resources  used  by  that  job  to  be\nreturned  to  the  preferred  idle  conditions  (e.g.,  port\naccess   door   closed).   When   a   transfer   job   involves\nmultiple  ports  on  an  equipment,  restore  activities  are\ndone  on  a  port-by-port  basis  as  each  port  is  no  longer\nneeded by the transfer job.\nSecondary  Transfer  Partner  \u2014  The  opposite  of  the\nprimary  transfer  partner.  This  partner  is  either  passive\nduring  the  transfer  or  is  controlled  by  the  primary\ntransfer   partner.   If   active,   this   partner   shall   await\ncommunications from the primary partner before acting\n(see micro level).\nSetup  \u2014  A  process  associated  with  an  atomic  transfer\nthat  causes  the  port  resources  to  achieve  required  pre\u2013\ntransfer conditions (e.g., port access door open).\nStop \u2014 A command available to the host that causes an\norderly termination of a transfer job. Upon receipt of a\nstop   command,   the   equipment   shall   complete   all\ncurrently  active  atomic  transfers,  execute  the  \u201crestore\u201d\nprocess, and then terminate.\n4. 1.2   Atomic  Transfer  \u2014  An  atomic   transfer  is  the\nhandoff  of  a  transfer  object  from  one  equipment  to\nanother.  This  is  the  fundamental  building  block  of\nmaterial  movement.  An  atomic  transfer  includes  the\nminimum  number  of  physical  participants  in  the  move:\none sender and one receiver. Thus, only one change of\nownership   shall   occur   in   an   atomic   transfer.   All\ntransfers  required  in  practice  can  be  constructed  as  a\nseries  of  atomic  transfers.  A  set  of  atomic  transfers\ncombined  to  make  a  complex  but  cohesive  transfer  is\ncalled a compound transfer.\n4. 1.3   Compound  Transfer  \u2014  On  the   factory  floor,\nmany  material  transfer  situations  will  require  multiple\natomic  transfers.  For  example,  the  host  may  determine\nthat   a   material   carrier   needs   to   be   moved   from\nequipment \u201cX\u201d to equipment \u201cY\u201d by transfer agent \u201cT.\u201d\nTo  accomplish  the  transfer  would  require  two  atomic\ntransfers, first \u201cT\u201d acquires the carrier from \u201cX,\u201d then it\ndelivers  it  to  \u201cY.\u201d  A  compound  transfer  might  involve\nseveral   equipment   and   include   parallel   as   well   as\nsequential execution of atomic transfers.\n4. 1.4  Parallel Transfers \u2014 Each por t on an equipment\nis a separate entity. It is possible, within the limitations\nof the equipment and transfer agents, to execute parallel\ntransfers  involving  separate  ports  on  an  equipment.\nThese  parallel  transfers  may  be  with  the  same  transfer\npartner, or with multiple partners. There are no inherent\nrestrictions  to  a  transfer  job  simultaneously  executing\nmultiple   atomic   transfers   on   an   equipment.   If   an\nequipment's  ports  are  static  (i.e.,  always  passive),  the\nequipment  should  allow  parallel  transfers.  If  the  ports\nare  dynamic,  there  may  be  some  sharing  of  resources\nwhich could limit this (e.g., use of the same robot arm).\nAn equipment is not required to allow parallel transfers.\n4. 1.5   Transfer  Recipe  \u2014  The  transfe r  recipe  is  an\nelement  of  the  transfer  specification.  The  scope  of  a\ntransfer  recipe  is  one  atomic  transfer.  A  transfer  recipe\nmay contain information defining the following aspects\nof a transfer:\n\u2022 setup/restore operations,\n\u2022 sequence of handoff operations (see micro level),\n\u2022 micro level commands to be issued by the primary\npartner to the secondary transfer partner,\n\u2022 parameters relating to the transfer.\nThus,   the   host   may   use   the   transfer   recipe   to\ncommunicate the details that make it possible to prepare\nfor and carry out the micro level transfer.\nUse  of  transfer  recipes  is  not  a  requirement.  However,\nthese  recipes  provide  for  dynamically  \u201cprogramming\u201d\nan  equipment  to  interact  properly  with  what  may  be  a\ncompletely different type of equipment. For instance, it\nmay  be  possible  to  \u201cteach\u201d  one  transfer  partner  the\nproprietary     commands     that     the     other     partner\nunderstands   by   embedding   those   commands   in   a\ntransfer recipe. During the transfer, the primary partner\ncould  issue  those  commands  at  the  proper  time  using\nstandard micro level messages (see Section 5).\nTransfer   recipes   should   be   created   and   managed\naccording to applicable SEMI standards and in a similar"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E32-0997 \xa9 SEMI 1994, 199710\nmanner to other types of recipes on the equipment (e.g.,\nprocess recipes).\n4. 1.6  Transfer System Controller as  Transfer Agent \u2014\nA  transfer  agent  is  an  entity  to  which  transfer-related\ncommands are given in order to carry out transfer jobs.\nA transfer system, which might include several material\ntransport  devices,  can  be  described  the  same  way.\nHowever, there are some important differences.\nThere  are  a  number  of  ways  that  a  host  could  view  a\ntransport system, including:\n\u2022 as a single transfer agent with numerous ports,\n\u2022 as  a  single  transfer  agent  with  a  single  port  and\nnumerous internal locations,\n\u2022 as  multiple  logical  transfer  agents  with  their  own\nports, or\n\u2022 as  the  set  of  real  transfer  agents  that  the  transfer\nsystem controls.\nThe  transfer  system  may  conceal  from  the  host  the\nvarious internal operations (e.g., handoffs, travel paths)\nthat it uses to complete a transfer. It may even hide the\nactual  physical  location  (or  series  of  locations)  and\nprovide a logical location for host reference.\n4. 1.7   Transfer  Job  \u2014   The  host's  ma terial  transfer\nobjectives are defined in a transfer job. This transfer job\nmay be a single atomic transfer or a compound transfer.\nA  compound  transfer  job  consists  of  multiple  atomic\ntransfers   grouped   together   to   accomplish   a   more\ncomplex  objective.  A  typical  compound  transfer  may\nalso be accomplished by creating a separate transfer job\nfor each required atomic transfer. The decision to group\natomic   transfers   into   a   transfer   job   is   application-\ndependent.\nThe  key  advantages  to  the  use  of  compound  transfer\njobs  are  the  reduction  of  the  communication  overhead\nto the host and the streamlining of the transfer process.\nThe communication overhead is reduced by the fact that\nthe   host   can   define   a   number   of   atomic   transfer\noperations with a single message to the equipment. The\nequipment  are  not  required  to  wait  for  host  commands\nbetween these atomic transfers.\nThe  process  is  streamlined  by  virtue  of  the  removal  of\nredundant  physical  activities  during  the  transfer  job.\nTotal setup and restore time for a port may be reduced\nif the setup for consecutive atomic transfers is similar.\nOne  example  of  streamlining  would  be  the  \u201cexchange\u201d\nof  carriers  between  equipment,  where  a  transfer  agent\nmight bring an empty carrier to replace a full carrier on\nthe  \u201coutput  port\u201d  of  a  machine.  If  the  port  has  a  door\nthat  is  opened  during  transfer  preparation  and  closed\nduring  the  restore  phase,  the  door  would  be  better  left\nopen for both atomic transfers. Upon completion of the\nremoval of the first transfer object, rather than close the\ndoor,  the  new  transfer  is  begun  and  the  door  left  open.\nThe two atomic transfers would thus be executed as one\nsmooth \u201cswap\u201d transfer without wasted time.\nEquipment View of Transfer Job \u2014 A transfer job may\ninvolve  a  number  of  equipment  and  ports.  Each  of  the\ninvolved  equipment  is  given  a  Transfer  Job  Create\nrequest  that  specifies  only  the  portion  of  the  overall\ntransfer job that involves that equipment. Only the host\nis   guaranteed   a   complete   picture   of   a   compound\ntransfer.  In  the  example  where  a  transfer  job  was\ncreated  to  move  a  transfer  object  from  \u201cX\u201d  to  \u201cY\u201d  via\ntransfer agent \u201cT,\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cX\u201d would see send material to \u201cT,\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cY\u201d would see receive material from \u201cT,\u201d and\n\u2022 \u201cT\u201d  would  see  get  material  from  \u201cX\u201d  and  put\nmaterial on \u201cY.\u201d\nAtomic  Transfer  Sequencing  Guidelines  \u2014  When  the\ntransfer  job  given  to  an  equipment  contains  multiple\natomic  transfers,  the  guidelines  for  performing  those\ntransfers are:\n\u2022 Atomic transfers for a specified port are performed\nin the sequence given.\n\u2022 When  a  transfer  job  references  multiple  ports  on\nthe   equipment,   these   ports   may   execute   their\natomic job sequences in parallel to the other ports.\nSee  Figure  4.1  for  an  illustration  of  the  flow  of  a\ncomplex  transfer  job  from  the  view  of  one  equipment.\nThe three parallel paths show a possible chronology for\na transfer job."),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E32-0997 \xa9 SEMI 1994, 199711\nFigure 4.1\nTransfer Job Sequencing\nThere   are   exceptions   to   the   sequencing   guidelines\nabove.   One   case   would   be   a   device   designed   to\nsimultaneously  transfer  from  multiple  ports  on  one\nmachine to corresponding ports on another. This would\ntranslate  into  synchronized  parallel  atomic  transfers  on\nseparate  ports.  Another  case  would  be  two  atomic\ntransfers  involving  the  same  port  that  might  happen\nconcurrently. That is, a transfer object is transferred out\nof  the  port  at  the  same  time\n4"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"another  is  transferred  in.\nIn  either  of  these  cases,  the  equipment  is  responsible\nfor:"),(0,r.yg)("ol",null,(0,r.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"recognizing  that  such  transfers  can  and  should  be\ncombined and"),(0,r.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"synchronizing the execution of the transfers.\nMultiple  Transfer  Jobs  \u2014  Multiple  transfer  jobs  may\nexist  simultaneously  on  an  equipment.

It does not imply that both transfer objects must move\nsimultaneously.\nQueued  transfer  jobs  and  parallel  transfer  jobs  are\nseparate concepts, either of which may be supported.\nResource   Allocation/Deallocation   \u2014   Transfer   jobs\nallocate    the    needed    material    locations    prior    to\nbeginning.  These  material  locations  remain  allocated\nuntil  the  transfer  job  chooses  to  release  them.  In  many\ncases,  a  material  location  is  physically  linked  with  a\nsingle  port,  and  the  allocation  of  that  location  infers\nallocation   of   the   port.   However,   this   is   not   a\nrequirement.\nIf  the  material  locations  for  a  transfer  job  are  not\navailable or are not in the proper state, the job shall be\nrejected or queued (if queuing supported and queue not\nfull).   For   the   transfer   job   to   begin,   each   location\nreferenced in the equipment's transfer job must contain\nthe  proper  material  for  the  first  atomic  transfer  which\nwould use that location.\nIf parallel transfer jobs are supported and the necessary\nlocations are available, a second (or third, etc.) transfer\njob may begin execution.\nIn  some  cases  a  port  may  provide  direct  access  to\nmultiple locations. This may be true for the specialized\nports  described  in  Section  3.2  and  in  cases  where  the\nport  serves  as  a  pass\u2013through  to  internal  locations.  For\neach  atomic  transfer,  the  needed  port  and  its  resources\nare   allocated   just   prior   to   the   start   and   released\n(deallocated) at the end of that atomic transfer.\n4. 2  Macro Level Behavior\n4. 2.1   Macro  Level  Communications  \u2014  This  section\nprovides  a  high-level  definition  of  the  communications\nbetween  the  host  and  each  transfer  partner  needed  to\nachieve  the  macro  level  of  material  transport.  This  is\nnot  intended  to  define  the  messages,  but  rather  to\ndescribe  the  concepts.  The  message  detail  is  addressed\nin the Macro Level Services Section (4.4). Section 4.2.2\nshows   how   these   messages   are   integrated   into   the\ntransfer job behavior model.\nFirst,  the  control  message  flow  is  presented  as  Figure\n4. 2.

These  state  models  are  not\nsubstates   of   the   transfer   job   state   model.   Rather,\ntransfer  job  and  atomic  transfers  are  separate  entities\nwhich interact.\nFigure 4.6\nAtomic Transfer State Diagram\nThe   definitions   for   the   states   and   state   transitions\nfollow.\nATOMIC TRANSFER QUEUED\nIn  this  state,  the  atomic  transfer  is  awaiting  its  turn  to\nexecute at the port.\nTRANSFER ACTIVE\nIn  this  state,  the  transfer  job  has  activated  this  atomic\ntransfer.   The   atomic   transfer   is   performed   entirely\nwithin    this    state.    The    substates    of    TRANSFER\nACTIVE are SETUP and HANDOFF.\nThe    TRANSFER    ACTIVE    state    in    this    model\ncorresponds  to  the  ATOMIC  TRANSFER  ACTIVE\nstate  in  the  transfer  job  state  model.  Thus,  when  the\ntransfer job activates an atomic transfer on a port, both\nstate  models  shall  be  in  the  (ATOMIC)  TRANSFER\nACTIVE  state  during  the  atomic  transfer.  This  applies\nonly to the specific atomic transfer being performed.\nSETUP\nWhile  in  the  SETUP  substate,  the  equipment  performs\nany  pre\u2013transfer  setup  operations  necessary  for  the\ncurrent atomic transfer.

In addition,\nthe  possibility  that  some  transfers  will  end  abnormally\nis  discussed.  While  not  every  implementation  requires\nthese  capabilities,  all  face  the  prospect  of  problems\nduring  transfer.  This  section  describes  how  the  basic\nstate   models   provided   above   may   be   extended   to\ninclude such features.\n4. 3.1    Extended   Communications   \u2014    T his   section\ndescribes the new commands the host may use to affect\ncurrent  transfer  jobs  and  the  events  associated  with\nthese new capabilities.\nPause  \u2014  The  host  may  issue  a  command  to  pause  a\ntransfer  job\n9\n.  A  command  to  pause  shall  cause  the\nsubject to continue to the first safe, continuable pausing\nplace  and  then  cease  activity.  The  pause  shall  occur\nonly  at  points  that  allow  for  the  resumption  of  the\nactivity  (see  the  resume  command).  Pausing  a  transfer\njob  results  in  the  pausing  of  each  atomic  transfer  for\nthat  transfer  job  (see  Figure  4.8).  The  points  where  a\npause may fall should be defined by the supplier. Note\nthat a paused transfer job may be aborted or stopped as\nan alternative to the resume command. In this case, the\nstop command may cause the equivalent of a resume in\norder to allow the current atomic transfers to complete.\nThere are two actions that may cause a pause. The first\nis a host command as described in the paragraph above.\nThe  second  is  a  decision  by  the  equipment  that  a\nproblem  exists  that  requires  outside  intervention.  For\ninstance,   if   a   port   hardware   problem   exists,   the\nequipment may pause the job automatically. The user or\nhost   may   then   resume   the   transfer   job   when   the\nhardware problem is corrected, or alternately abort/stop\nthe transfer job if the problem is severe.\nResume \u2014 The resume command is used to continue a\npreviously paused transfer activity.\nStop  \u2014  The  host  may  command  the  involved  partners\nto  stop  a  transfer  job.  The  stop  command  terminates  a\njob   in   an   orderly   manner.   The   object   of   the   stop\ncommand  is  to  complete  currently  executing  atomic\ntransfers and leave the equipment and material in a safe\nstate.  While  the  time  needed  to  stop  should  be  kept  as\nshort as possible, this goal should be a lower priority.\nIf   the   specified   transfer   job   is   queued,   the   stop\ncommand acts as a cancel command."),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"9 It is expected that a host may also pause a port or other hardware.\nHowever, this document does not specify these hardware-related\ncommands.\nCancel \u2014 The host may cancel a transfer job which has\nnot  yet  become  active  (e.g.,  a  job  which  is  queued).\nThis is useful when it is unacceptable to affect transfer\nwhich  is  in\u2013progress.  A  canceled  job  is  removed  from\nthe  queue  and  discarded.  No  physical  action  may  be\nassociated with canceling a transfer job. If the specified\ntransfer  job  is  active,  the  equipment  shall  reject  this\ncommand.\nAbort \u2014 The host may command the involved partners\nto  abort  a  transfer  job.  The  goal  of  the  abort  command\nis to end the transfer activities (especially movement) as\nquickly   as   possible,   while   retaining   equipment   and\nmaterial  integrity.  Aborting  a  transfer  job  shall  cause\nthe  individual  atomic  transfers  to  also  abort.  As  with\nstop,  the  abort  command  terminates  the  transfer  job.\nDifferent  from  the  stop  command  is  that  equipment\nexecuting   an   abort   command   shall   require   manual\nintervention     before     further     material     movement\noperations  are  performed.  Abort  is  intended  for  use\nwhen serious problems are detected and further damage\nneeds to be prevented.\nThe  abort  command  takes  precedence  over  the  stop,\npause,  and  cancel  commands.

A  piece  of  equipment\nwould  send  the  same  defined  micro  level  message  as\nbefore, but would deliver it to the host via the standard\nhost  link.  The  equipment  would  treat  the  host  as  its\ntransfer  partner,  expecting  the  same  response  as  if  it\nwere  talking  directly  to  its  true  transfer  partner.  The\nhost  is  responsible  for  managing  the  relay  of  messages\nfrom one partner to the other as necessary.\nThe  equipment  shall  provide  the  ability  to  pass  micro\nlevel  messages  through  the  host.

The\nHOCancelReady message is used for this purpose.\nThe  HOCancelReady  shall  be  accepted  by  the  transfer\npartner  unless  it  has  already  sent  the  corresponding\nHOReady.  In  cases  where  both  transfer  partners  have\nsent   the   HOReady   message,   the   atomic   transfer   is\nconsidered to have begun and cannot be canceled.

The    actual    model    is    implementation-\ndependent.\nFigure A1-1\nExample Port State Diagram\nMECHANISM\nThis   state   pertains   to   the   port's   overall   ability   to\nfunction.  It  has  three  substates:  INIT,  NORMAL,  and\nFAULT.\nINIT\nThis  is  the  default  state  upon  powerup  or  reset  of  the\nport.  It  includes  some  unspecified  operations  to  ensure\nthat the port is ready to operate.\nNORMAL\nWhen  in  this  substate,  the  port  is  in  normal  working\norder.\nFAULT\nIn this substate, a problem has been detected with a port\nmechanism.\nAVAILABILITY\nThis  state  pertains  to  the  availability  of  the  port  to\nperform a function. This state has two substates:  NOT\nALLOCATED and ALLOCATED.\nNOT ALLOCATED\nIn the NOT ALLOCATED state, neither the equipment\nnor  the  host  has  allocated  the  port.  The  port  is  waiting\nto  be  allocated  to  either  a  transfer  job  or  to  some\nprocess-related  task.  This  is  the  default  state  upon\nequipment system startup.\nALLOCATED\nIn this state, the port is allocated to either the equipment\n(typically  process-related)  or  to  the  host  for  a  transfer\njob.\nNOTE:  If  the  port  is  allocated  to  an  equipemnt  function  and\nthe host does not wish to wait for the equipment to release the\nport,  it  must  take  some  other  action  to  force  the  port  to\nbecome  available.  One  possibility  is  a  \u201cPause  for  Transfer\u201d\nremote  command  that  might  be  used  during  a  processing\ncycle.\nIDLE\nPort  is  allocated  to  a  task  (e.g.,  processing  or  transfer\njob), but activity on the task has not yet begun.\nPAUSE\nThis   state   pertains   to   the   pausing   of   current   port\nactivity.  Pausing  of  the  port  is  different  than  pausing  a\ntransfer job which might be using the port.\nNOT PAUSED\nThe   port   defaults   to   NOT   PAUSED   upon   system\nstartup. In this state, port activities are not hindered by\nthe pause function.\nPAUSING\nIn  this  state,  the  port  has  received  a  directive  to  pause\nand is in the process of bringing the current activity to a\nhalt.\nPAUSED\nAll  port  activity  has  ceased.  The  port  is  awaiting  a\ndirective to resume activity.\nTable  A1-1  describes  the  transitions  for  the  example\nport     state     model.

Most\nsuch  state  models  will  be  simple  two\u2013state  instances\n(e.g., open/closed, on/off).\nIn some circumstances, the host will have a need to be\nable  to  understand  the  status  of  these  mechanisms  and\nmay  wish  to  be  informed  of  state  changes.  This  is\nespecially  true  if  the  host  is  to  do  error  handling  and\npreliminary  diagnosis  of  problems.  The  host  also  may\nneed  some  level  of  remote  commands  to  manipulate\nthese    mechanisms.    Some    possible    transfer-related\nmechanisms are discussed below.\nPort   Material   Sensors:      These   sensors   detect   the\npresence or absence of material in a port. The change in\nthis status is important, and an event should be provided\nto report change in this condition.\nPort  Doors:    Some  equipment  closes  the  environment\ninternal   to   the   equipment,   except   during   material\ntransfer.     The     applicable     states     are     normally\nopen/closed.\nPort Elevator:  Port elevators have multiple states such\nas  HOME,  MOVING,  SLOT  5  ACCESS,  or  interlocks\nsuch   as   BLOCKED   BY   INTERNAL   TRANSFER\nARM.\nRobot  Arm:    The  transfer  arm  may  be  in  motion,  may\nbe holding material, etc.\nCarrier Restraints:  On some ports, carriers are clamped\nin place and cannot be removed unless the restraints are\nreleased.  There  would  be  a  clamped/unclamped  state\nmodel.\nA1-2    WIP  Tracking  \u2014  WIP  tracking  refers  to  the\nability of an entity (host or equipment) to keep accurate\ntrack  of  the  material  within  its  domain.  Typically,  the\nequipment  is  expected  to  track  the  material's  location\nwithin  its  modules  and  subsystems,  while  the  host  may\ntake  a  more  global  view,  knowing  at  which  equipment\n(or storage area) a specific transfer object resides.\nThe    process    of    material    movement    crosses    the\nboundary  of  the  equipment  domain.  Therefore,  there\nmust   be   information   exchanged   between   host   and\nequipment about what material is being transferred and\nwhat the plans are for the material (e.g., when and how\nprocessed).\nIt  is  outside  the  scope  of  this  standard  to  define  WIP\ntracking  capabilities,  either  at  the  host  or  equipment\nlevel. However, it is critical for the material movement\nfunction   to   supply   enough   information   that   WIP\ntracking     is     feasible.     Specifically,     the     material\nmovement  messaging  must  identify  the  object  being\ntransferred. WIP references are kept at a minimum. For\nexample,  for  a  carrier  containing  wafers,  the  material\nmovement  process  would  need  to  know  the  carrier\nidentifier,  but  need  not  be  concerned  with  the  specific\nlot  contained  within.  It  is  also  outside  the  scope  of  this\nstandard  to  be  concerned  with  the  detailed  contents  or\nstatus (e.g., processed or not) of a transfer object.

A  cassette  is  to  be\npicked  up  by  the  AGV  for  later  delivery  to  another\npiece   of   equipment.   The   equipment   has   a   cassette\nindexer  and  a  port  door,  but  no  other  port-related\nmechanism that would either aid or hinder transfer. The\nchosen  transfer  mechanism  provides  for  the  equipment\nto  act  as  a  passive  transfer  partner  with  no  micro  level\ncommunications   required.   This   is   called   a   passive\ntransfer. The primary transfer partner is the AGV.\nThe  setup  for  the  equipment  is  to  check  to  make  sure\nthat  the  correct  material  is  in  the  specified  port,  drive\nthe cassette elevator to the home position (if not already\nthere),  and  open  the  port  door.

The  host  system  must\ndo  the  high-level  planning  of  this  move,  determining\nthat the lot to be transferred will be ready to go, that the\nrobot  is  available,  and  that  the  receiving  equipment  is\navailable to receive the cassette.\nTo  accomplish  the  transfer,  two  atomic  moves  are\nrequired.

In  such  a\ncase,  both  \u201cA\u201d  and  \u201cB\u201d  would  need  to  be  ready  for\ntransfer  before  the  robot  program  was  executed.  The\nonly  limitation  is  that  this  combination  would  have  to\nmatch the model and messaging discussed above.\nA1-4.4    Linked  Lithography  \u2014  The  final  example  is\none where the micro level of material movement might\nbe used without the macro level messaging described in\nthis document. The linked lithography system described\nbelow  is  not  patterned  after  any  existing  system  and\nmay  not  be  the  optimal  implementation  for  such  a\nsystem.\nFor  this  example,  the  challenge  is  to  transfer  wafers\nfrom  a  typical  track  system  (following  the  coat/bake\nprocess) into a stepper for imaging, and then back to the\ntrack  system  for  the  develop  process.  In  this  example,\nthe stepper acts as a slave to the track system, accepting\nwafers   as   they   are   given.   The   non\u2013transfer-related\ncommunications will not be discussed.\nIn  the  wafer  transfer  process,  the  track  takes  on  the\nmacro  level  duties  of  the  host.  It  is  responsible  for\ninforming  the  stepper  that  a  wafer  is  to  be  transferred,\nwhich  wafer,  and  by  what  path  and  mechanism.  It  will\ninitiate   the   transfer   in   a   method   analogous   to   the\nTransfer  Job  Create  request.  There  is  no  transfer  agent\nin this case. Either equipment might act as the primary\ntransfer partner \u2014 it is irrelevant to this example.\nThe  stepper  and  track  will  then  exchange  the  normal\nmicro  communications.  First,  the  HOReady  messages\nwill be sent. Next, the track will issue HOCommands to\ncause the wafer to be physically transferred. Finally, the\nHOVerify      message      transaction      would      occur.\nMeaningful  events  would  be  reported  to  the  host  as\nappropriate.\nAn  alternative  would  be  to  design  the  system  such  that\nthe track system tells the stepper system, in effect, \u201cI'll\nbe   sending   a   series   of   wafers   to   you.\u201d   Since   the\nHOReady  message  contains  sufficient  information  to\ndescribe   the   transfer   (assuming   a   specific   transfer\nrecipe is not required), no specifics about the individual\ntransfers need be exchanged until the HOReady is sent.\nIn such a scheme, the stepper would take the HOReady\nmessage  as  description  of  the  specific  transfer  and\nrespond with an HOReady to match.\nA1-4.5  Non\u2013Compliant Transfer Partner \u2014 There will\nbe  situations  where  only  one  of  the  transfer  partners  is\ncompliant with this standard. It is reasonable to use this\ntransfer  methodology  in  some  such  cases,  especially\nthose  involving  passive  transfer.  The  host  would  be\nresponsible  for  emulating  a  compliant  transfer  partner\non  behalf  of  the  non\u2013compliant  partner  (for  the  benefit\nof  the  compliant  partner).  Examples  of  non\u2013compliant\ntransfer  partners  might  include  a  WIP  rack,  a  human\ntransfer  agent,  an  older  process  equipment,  or  any\nmaterial handling systems that support other protocols.")),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E32-0997 \xa9 SEMI 1994, 199741\nNOTICE: These  standards  do  not  purport  to  address\nsafety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  their  use.
