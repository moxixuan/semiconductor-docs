The  same\nparticle  density,  particle  spacing,  and  defect  cluster\nconditions as in Section 8.1 should be observed.\nNOTE 4:  The wafer with deposited PSL spheres may or may\nnot be certified reference material.\n9  Procedure\n9. 1  Qualify the wafer for appropriate LLS number (see\nSection  8.1)  prior  to  taking  CR  and  CFCR  data  as\nfollows:\n9. 1.1  Scan  the  wafer  once  and  determine  position,  P\nm\n,\nand size, S\nm,\nof each of the M\n1\ndetected LLS events with\nm = ","[1, 2, ...

It is desirable to fix\nthe   oxidation   conditions.      Because   the   oxidation\ntemperature  influences  the  rate  of  oxidation,\n13\nwhich\ninfluences  the  oxide  film  thickness  and  thus  the  gate\noxide  quality,  it  is  recommended  that  the  gate  oxide  of\n20-25  nm  is  grown  in  dry  oxygen  ambient  at  850\xf1\n950\u221eC.

For  the  evaluation  of\nCOPs,  it  is  necessary  to  measure  100  or  more  MOS\ncapacitors with a gate area of about 10 mm\n2\non a wafer.\n(See Table R1-3 in Related Information 1.)  For spares,\nit is desirable to prepare the plural MOS capacitors with\nthe same gate area within each chip.\n5. 2.8  Etching  Processes  \xf3  The  photo  resist  pattern\nformed  by  the  photolithograph  technique  is  used  as  a\nmask  for  polysilicon  etching.    Generally,  either  a  wet\netching  method  or  a  dry  etching  method  is  applied  to\npolysilicon etching. If a wet etching method is applied,\nthe   etching   rate   shall   be   well   controlled.      If   the\nperipheral  oxide  of  the  electrode  is  removed,  it  is\nsometimes difficult to accurately measure the TZDB.  If\na  dry  etching  method  is  applied,  especially  RIE,  care\nshall   be   taken   with   the   charging-up   of   the   MOS\ncapacitors. In cases where the A-mode defect density is\nhigh,  the  MOS  capacitors  shall  be  confirmed  not  to  be\ncharged  up  during  the  etching  process.  If  an  ashing\nremoval  is  carried  out  with  the  photo  resist,  care  shall\nbe  taken  with  the  charging-up  of  the  MOS  capacitors.\nAs with RIE, in cases where the A-mode defect density\nis  high,  the  MOS  capacitors  shall  be  confirmed  not  to\nbe  charged  up  during  the  ashing  removal  process.  If\nthere  are  oxide  and  polysilicon  film  on  the  backside  of\nthe wafer, those shall be removed.\n5. 3  Measurement  of  the  Electrical  Characteristics  of\nMOS Capacitors\n5. 3.1      The   dielectric   breakdown   defect   density   of\nsilicon  oxide  is  evaluated  by  the  TZDB  method  for\nMOS  capacitors.    In  the  TZDB  method,  the  gate  oxide\nelectric  field  of  an  MOS  capacitor  is  continuously\nincreased in stepwise fashion.  The electric field applied\nto  the  gate  oxide  when  the  gate  oxide  leakage  current\nexceeds    the    predetermined    dielectric    breakdown\njudgment   value   is   defined   as   the   oxide   dielectric\nbreakdown  field.    From  a  histogram  of  the  breakdown\nfields  for  100  or  more  MOS  capacitors,  the  dielectric\nbreakdown defect density is estimated.\n5. 3.2    We  can  see  two  characteristics  of  the  formed\nMOS  capacitors  from  the  current-voltage  (I\xf1V)  plots.\nFirstly, deviation of the gate oxide thickness appears in\na loose distribution of the I-V plots.  Secondly, if the I-\nV  curves  bend  suddenly  and  have  gentle  slope  in  the\nhigh   voltage   region,   there   may   be   high   parasitic\nresistance,    for    example,    high    resistance    in    the\npolysilicon  electrode.    In  such  a  case,  the  reliable\nmeasurement   demands   the   adjustment   of   the   MOS\npreparation process.\n5. 3.3  Applied Step Voltage\nNOTE  8:      For  a  reliable  measurement,  a  voltage  source  with\na  well-defined  output  shape  shall  be  used.    An  overshooting\nof  the  applied  step  voltage  decreases  the  apparent  oxide\nbreakdown   voltage   as   compared   with   a   real   breakdown\nvoltage.    In  the  TZDB  measurement,  the  constant  voltage  is\nheld  after  a  predetermined  period  and  the  oxide  leakage\ncurrent  is  measured.    Next,  the  applied  voltage  increases\nstepwise.    This  procedure  is  repeated.    If  the  holding  time  is\nshorter than 100 ms, the voltage may not be stable enough to\nallow the current to be measured.  800 ms may be enough to\nachieve a stable voltage.  Especially, in the high electric field\nregion,  the  gate  oxide  may  receive  electric  stress  similar  to\ntime  dependent  dielectric  breakdown  (TDDB).    A  holding\ntime  of  200  ms  is  recommended.    Accordingly  to  the  round\nrobin  result  as  described  in  Related  Information  1,  there  are\nno problems in setting the holding time to 100\xf1800 ms.  The\nrecommended  step  height  of  the  applied  voltage  is  between\n0. 1\xf10.5 MV/cm in electric field. The polarity of the voltage is\nselected  for  the  Si  surface  so  as  to  be  in  accumulation.    That\nis, for p-type silicon wafers, the gate electrodes are negatively\nbiased.  The maximum electric field is 15 MV/cm.  Even if a\ngate   voltage   corresponding   to   more   than   15   MV/cm   is\napplied, the voltage is not effectively applied to the gate oxide\nbecause  of  a  voltage  drop  due  to  parasitic  resistance.    In  the\ncase  of  n-type  silicon  wafers,  the  applied  electrodes  shall  be\npositively biased.\n5. 3.4  Breakdown Judgment\n5. 3.4.1    The  oxide  dielectric  breakdown  is  judged  by\nthe predetermined oxide leakage current.  That is, when\nthe  gate  oxide  leakage  current  exceeds  the  dielectric\nbreakdown  judgment  current,  the  applied  voltage  is\ndefined  as  the  breakdown  voltage.    The  breakdown\nelectric field is the value that the breakdown voltage is\nnormalized by the gate oxide thickness.\n5. 3.4.1.1  Discussion  \xf3  If  the  dielectric  breakdown\njudgment current is too high (Ig > 10\n\xf13\nA), some of the\nproper  A-mode  failures  can  be  counted  as  B-mode\nfailures  because  of  the  series  resistance  of  the  samples\nor  measurement  system.

The MOS capacitors must be formed\nin accordance with the fabrication process described in\nSection 5 that influences the oxide characteristics.\n6. 2    It  is  well  known  that  both  the  silicon  surface\nmorphology  and  the  cross-sectional  structure  at  the\npattern  edge  of  the  active  region  of  the  MOS  devices\ninfluences  the  dielectric  breakdown  of  the  gate  oxide.\nVarious  kinds  of  contaminations  also  influence  the\ndielectric breakdown of the gate oxide.  Contamination\nby   alkaline   or   heavy   metals   and   organic   particles\nincreases  as  the  sample  fabrication  process  progresses.\nFurthermore,   COPs   increase   with   increasing   SC-1\ntreatment.    These  facts  indicate  that  it  is  desirable  to\nsimplify   the   sample   structure   and   its   fabrication\nprocesses  to  characterize  a  silicon  wafer  by  TZDB  of\nthe gate oxide.  Thermal processes can cause growth of\noxygen  precipitates  in  a  silicon  wafer.    This  standard\ncannot  be  applied  to  silicon  wafers  that  might  receive\nsuch thermal processes.\n6. 3      The   appropriate   area   and   the   appropriate   total\nnumber of the tested MOS capacitors shall be chosen so\nas  to  answer  the  purpose  of  this  standard  test.    For\nexample, as shown in Table R1-3, it is suitable to select\na  gate  electrode  area  of  10  mm\n2\nand  a  total  number  of\ncapacitors of more than 100.\n6. 4  The electrode material of the MOS capacitors has a\ngreat  influence  on  the  dielectric  breakdown  of  the  gate\noxide.  Polysilicon is specified as the electrode material\nin  this  standard.    It  is  applied  to  practical  ultra  large-\nscale   integrated   circuits   (ULSI).      The   polysilicon\nelectrode  yields  test  results  highly  consistent  with  the\nactual ULSI performance.\n1E-11\n1E-9\n1E-7\n1E-5\n1E-3\n1E-1\n0481216\nEbd (MV/cm)\nCurrent (A)\nIg > 1E-7 A\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n0481216\nEbd (MV/cm)\n(ln(-ln(1-P)))\nB-modeC-modeA-mode\nIg > 1E-3 AIg > 1E-5 AIg > 1E-7 A\n1E-11\n1E-9\n1E-7\n1E-5\n1E-3\n1E-1\n0481216\nEbd (MV/cm)\nCurrent (A)\nIg > 1E-5 A\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n0481216\nEbd (MV/cm)\n(ln(-ln(1-P)))\nB-modeC-modeA-mode\n1E-11\n1E-9\n1E-7\n1E-5\n1E-3\n1E-1\n0481216\nEbd (MV/cm)\nCurrent (A)\nIg > 1E-3 A\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n0481216\nEbd (MV/cm)\n(ln(-ln(1-P)))\nB-modeC-modeA-mode"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Figure 1\nComparison of Judgment Conditions"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M51-0303 \xa9 SEMI 2002, 2003 6\n7  Interferences\n7. 1  Since this is a DC measurement, care must be taken\nto make sure that the silicon wafer has a low resistance\nohmic contact.  There must be no dielectric film on the\nback  surface,  e.g.  silicon  oxide,  in  order  to  effectively\napply  a  voltage  bias  to  the  gate  oxide.   It  is  not\nnecessary for this to be done with a metallic contact to\nthe back surface of the wafer under test.\n7. 1.1    However,  when  the  vacuum  chucking  is  weak,\ncare  must  be  taken  because  of  the  possibility  that  the\ndielectric  breakdown  voltage  of  the  gate  oxide  is  not\naccurately  measured  due  to  an  increase  in  parasitic\nresistance.\n7. 2    It  is  strongly  suggested  that  testing  be  done  with  a\nvoltage  polarity  such  that  the  silicon  surface  will  be  in\naccumulation  below  the  gate  oxide,  that  is,  negative\nvoltages for p-type silicon wafers.  If the polarity of the\nvoltage  is  chosen  to  be  in  the  reverse  direction,  the\nbreakdown voltage may not be accurately measured due\nto  the  presence  of  a  depletion  layer  below  the  gate\noxide.\n7. 3    Evaluation  and  control  of  electrical  noise  in  the\ncurrent-voltage  data,  as  part  of  this  test  method  are\ncrucial to the proper identification of the failure criteria.\n7. 4      In   the   TZDB   measurement,   lowering   of   the\nelectrical  noise  under  a  low  bias  stress  condition  is\nmade  possible  by  the  averaging  of  measurement  data.\nWhile  the  required  100  ms  holding  time  may  be  set\nusing  a  delay  in  the  measurement  loop,  an  additional,\nuncontrolled   delay   may   be   incurred   due   to   the\nautoranging  of  an  electrometer.    The  effect  is  most\npronounced for very low oxide leakage currents, where\nthe  measured  value  is  several  orders  of  magnitude\nbelow   the   minimum   range   set   by   the   electrometer\nsoftware.\n7. 5      Mechanical   stress   by   the   exploring   probe   can\ninfluence    the    measurement    results,    because    the\nexploring  probe  is  in  contact  with  the  gate  electrode\ndirectly on the gate oxide.\n7. 6    The  actual  results  obtained  depend  somewhat  on\nthe  sample  fabrication  process.    Care  must  be  taken  to\nensure consistent processing.\n7. 7    Wafer  temperature  during  testing  shall  be  clearly\ndefined.

Here,  based  on  an  assumption  that  the\ndielectric breakdown defect is in conformance with the\nPoisson distribution, the defect density by TZDB of 25\nnm  thick  oxide,  \u03c1,  was  calculated  from  the  dielectric\nbreakdown failure fraction of TZDB, F, as follows.\n\u03c1\nox\n= -ln(1 \xf1 F)/S       (8)\nHere,  S  is  a  gate  electrode  area  of  the  evaluated  MOS\ncapacitors.\nR1-1.1.3    The  defect  density  was  obtained  by  the  B-\nmode failure percent, F, of TZDB.

The  OPP  defects  were  measured  in  the\nwafers  at  the  same  position  (ingot)  of  the  same  Si\ncrystal  as  the  sample  wafers.

Thus the width of the deposition on the wafer is no larger than the width of the transfer function.  A narrow\nwidth decreases calibration uncertainty in three ways.  First, in the presence of background noise, it makes the distribution peak signal easier to\nlocate.  Second, a narrow transfer function makes the deposition distribution peak easier to determine.
