A reticle pod location is any physical\narea that is capable of holding a pod.  It is not intended to represent entire mechanisms, which may have a variety of\nother properties of interest, but only that portion where a reticle pod may rest.\n10. 3.7  Reticle Pod Location Examples\n10. 3.7.1  Reticle  Pod  Locations  include  reticle  pod load  port  locations,  internal  pod  buffer  locations,  as  well  as\ngrippers, conveyors, and elevators that are used internally for moving the pod from one fixed location to another.\n10. 3.8  Slot  Map  Relation  to  Content  Map \u23af  The  slot  map  attribute  and  content  map  attribute  hold  similar\ninformation.      The  purpose  of  these  attributes  differs.    The  slot  map  is  provided  so  that  the  equipment  or  host  can\nquickly verify that the pod has reticles correctly placed in the correct slot (as provided by the host).  This verification\nis based on a slot map read.  The content map is provided so that the host can communicate the specific ReticleID in\na specific slot as delivered and that the equipment can communicate the specific ReticleID that it places in a specific\nslot.\n10. 3.9  Reticle  Pod  Location  Naming \u23af  All  locations  shall  be  assigned  a  unique  name.    Information  about  the\nreticle  pod  location  can  be  obtained  by  querying  the  Pod  Object  for  the  ReticlePodLocationID  or  by  asking  the\nequipment  for  the  PodLocationMatrix.    The  text  form  of  the  ReticlePodLocationID  shall  be  descriptive  of  the\nlocation.\n10. 3.10  Capacity\n10. 3.10.1  The  Capacity  parameter  can  be  sent  to  the  equipment  by  the  host  in  the  PodNotification,  Bind,\nReticleTransferJob, or the ProceedWithPod service.  However the equipment shall update this\n10. 3.10.2  Parameter  based  on  the  results  of  the  read  slot  map  operation.    Furthermore,  the  equipment  shall  update\nthe parameter based on it\u2019s own actions.  If the equipment does not know the value of Capacity prior to instantiation,\nthe equipment shall instantiate the reticle pod object with the value of one for Capacity.\n10. 3.11  The ReticlePodAccessing\n10. 3.11.1  Status  is  used  by  the  host  to  know  whether  or  not  the  reticle  pod  owned  by  the  equipment  can  be\ntransferred from the equipment.\n10. 3.11.2  Enumerated      values      of      ReticlePodAccessing-Status      correspond      to      the      substates      of\nReticlePodAccessingStatus (see Figure 2).\n10. 4  Reticle Pod State Model\n10. 4.1  The purpose of the Reticle Pod State Model is to define the host\u2019s view of a reticle pod.

There are two types of substrate locations: reticle pod reticle location, which is the location or\nposition  (e.g.,  slot)  in  the  reticle  pod,  and  equipment  reticle  location,  which  is  on  the  equipment  resource.    The\nequipment reticle location is a persistent object, while the reticle pod reticle locations are dynamic objects that shall\nbe created or deleted by the placement or removal of reticle pods on the equipment.  The intent is to follow E90 in\nregards to location object management.  The reticle location object is a subtype of the substrate location object.\n17. 1.1  Source reticle locations and Destination reticle locations are the points at which reticles transfer to/from the\nequipment\u2019s internal reticle locations (often locations at which processing occurs).  A reticle pod reticle location is\nthe Source or Destination reticle location when a pod is used to transfer the reticle.  An equipment reticle location\ncan be the Source or Destination reticle location when the reticle is transferred directly (without a pod).\n17. 2  Reticle Location State Model \u23af Figure 9 below shows the dynamic behavior of the reticle location using the\nHarel state chart representation."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"\xa9\nUNOCCUPIEDOCCUPIED\nRETICLE LOCATION\n1\n2"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"Figure 9\nReticle Location State Model Diagram"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E109-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2001, 2005 41\n17. 3  Reticle Location State Definitions\n17. 3.1  RETICLE LOCATION \u2014 the superstate of UNOCCUPIED and OCCUPIED.\n17. 3.2  UNOCCUPIED \u2014 the state in which the reticle location does not hold or have a reticle.\n17. 3.3  OCCUPIED \u2014 the state in which the reticle location holds a reticle.\n17. 4  Substrate Location State Transition\nTable 19  Reticle Location State Model Transition Table"),(0,o.yg)("h1",{id:"current---------state---------trigger---------new-state-action-comment"},"Current         State         Trigger         New State Action Comment"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"1     UNOCCUPIED       Reticle     moves onto the substrate\nlocation.\nOCCUPIED None.
