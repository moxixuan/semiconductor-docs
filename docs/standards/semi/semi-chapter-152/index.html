RELATED INFORMATION 1
SUMMARY OF MULTI LABORATORY ROUND ROBIN TEST
NOTICE: This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  MF1810.    It  was  developed  as  part  of
the  development  of  the  document.    This  related  information  was  approved  for  publication  by  full  letter
ballot on December 4, 2004.
R1-1    The  multilaboratory  round  robin  test  was  done
over    a    period    of    12    months    and    included    16
laboratories.      The   test   required   each   laboratory   to
complete  11  diameter  scan  measurements  of  seven
wafers.    A  “diameter  scan”  area  is  equal  to  the  area
defined  by  a  microscope  field  of  view  and  a  length
equal  to  the  wafer  diameter  less  the  edge  exclusion.
Only  one  defect  classification,  OISF,  was  included  in
the  count  and  described  with  pictures.    The  sequence
and path of the measurement scans were defined so that
the  comparison  of  the  individual  measurements  would
be possible among data sets.  Within the ability of each
laboratory to align the sample on the microscope stage,
the starting point and scan path was held constant.
R1-2    The  complete  repeatability  and  reproducibility
study  results  are  listed  in  Table  R1-1  for  the  four  scan
method  for  the  parameter,  deviation  from  target,  in
units of defects/cm
2
.  The average range was 2.107 and
the range of x-bars  was 12.130.

deviation  (LSD)  method  for  the  deviation  from  target
by  laboratory  was  done.    Results  are  shown  in  Table
R1-2.    Differences  among  laboratories  are  also  evident
in  the  95%  confidence  interval  box  and  whisker  plot
provided  in  Figure  R1-1,  which  shows  the  deviation
from  target  for  each  laboratory.    This  plot  is  based  on
four diameter scans per test.
R1-4      Results   from   Laboratory   F   were   significantly
different  from  all  other  laboratories,  but  were  included
in  the  reported  Precision  and  Bias  Section  because  no
evidence   pointed   to   a   procedural   mistake.      The

results are listed in Table R1-3 for the four scan method
for  the  parameter,  deviation  from  target,  in  units  of

and the range of x-bars was 7.018.

GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY
FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE
PROFILE DATA
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  for  publication  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  March  14,  2004.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>

Last previous edition SEMI MF1811-97(2002).
1 Purpose</p><ol><li>1        There    is    some    confusion    in    the    roughness-
measurement    community    concerning    the    use    of
estimators   and   the   calculation   of   power   spectral
densities  (PSDs)  from  discrete  data  sets.    Use  of  this
guide  can  eliminate  these  differences  and  result  in  the
use   of   consistent   units   for   the   PSD   and   related
parameters.      It   also   provides   a   uniform   reporting
procedure  for  digital  roughness  data  that  can  facilitate
communication between different workers and different
laboratories.
2 Scope</li><li>1  This guide defines the methodology for calculating
a   set   of   commonly   used   statistical   parameters   and
functions  of  surface  roughness  from  a  set  of  measured
surface   profile   data.      Its   purposes   are   to   provide
fundamental procedures and notation for processing and
presenting data, to alert the reader to related issues that
may  arise  in  user-specific  applications,  and  to  provide
literature references where further details can be found.</li><li>2      This   guide   is   limited   to   the   analysis   of   one-
dimensional  or  profile  data  taken  at  uniform  intervals
along   straight   lines   across   the   surface   under   test,
although  reference  is  made  to  the  more  general  case  of
two-dimensional      measurements      made      over      a
rectangular array of data points.</li><li>3      The   data   analysis   procedures   described   in   this
guide   are   generic   and   are   not   limited   to   specific
surfaces,   surface-generation   techniques,   degrees   of
roughness,   or   measuring   techniques.      Examples   of
measuring  techniques  that  can  be  used  to  generate
profile   data   for   analysis   are   mechanical   profiling
instruments   using   a   rigid   contacting   probe,   optical
profiling instruments that sample over a line or an array
over  an  area  of  the  surface,  optical  interferometry,  and
scanning-microscopy  techniques  such  as  atomic-force
microscopy.        The    distinctions    between    different
measuring  techniques  enter  this  guide  through  various
parameters and functions that are defined in Sections 4
and 5, such as their sampling intervals, bandwidths, and
measurement transfer functions.</li><li>4  The primary interest here is the characterization of
random or periodic aspects of surface finish rather than
isolated   surface   defects   such   as   pits,   protrusions,
scratches  or  ridges.    Although  the  methods  of  data
analysis  described  here  can  be  equally  well  applied  to
profile  data  of  isolated  surface  features,  the  parameters
and  functions  that  are  derived  using  the  procedures
described  in  this  guide  may  have  a  different  physical
significance   than   those   derived   from   random   or
periodic surfaces.</li><li>5    The  statistical  parameters  and  functions  that  are
discussed   in   this   guide   are,   in   fact,   mathematical
abstractions  that  are  generally  defined  in  terms  of  an
infinitely-long  linear  profile  across  the  surface,  or  the
“ensemble”  average  of  an  infinite  number  of  finite-
length   profiles.      In   contrast,   real   profile   data   are
available  in  the  form  of  one  or  more  sets  of  digitized
height  data  measured  at  a  finite  number  of  discrete
positions  on  the  surface  under  test.    This  guide  gives
both  the  abstract  definitions  of  the  statistical  quantities
of  interest,  and  numerical  procedures  for  determining
values   of   these   abstract   quantities   from   sets   of
measured  data.    In  the  notation  of  this  guide  these
numerical  procedures  are  called  “estimators”  and  the
results that they produce are called “estimates”.</li><li>6      This   guide   gives   “periodogram”   estimators   for
determining the root-mean-square (rms) roughness, rms
slope,  and  power  spectral  density  (PSD)  of  the  surface
directly  from  profile  height  or  slope  measurements.
The statistical literature uses a circumflex to distinguish
an  estimator  or  estimate  from  its  abstract  or  ensemble-
average  value.    For  example,  Â  denotes  an  estimate  of
the quality A.  However, some word-processors cannot
place   a   circumflex   over   consonants   in   text.      Any
symbolic or verbal device may be used instead.</li><li>7  The quality of estimators of surface statistics are, in
turn, characterized by higher-order statistical properties
that  describe  their  “bias”  and  “fluctuation”  properties
with   respect   to   their   abstract   or   ensemble-average
versions.    This  guide  does  not  discuss  the  higher-order
statistical  properties  of  the  estimators  given  here  since
their  practical  significance  and  use  are  application-
specific   and   beyond   the   scope   of   this   document.</li></ol><p>SEMI MF1811-0704 © SEMI 2003, 2004 2

2. 8      Raw   measured   profile   data   generally   contain
trending   components   that   are   independent   of   the
microtopography of the surface being measured.  These
components must be subtracted before the difference or
residual errors are subjected to the statistical-estimation
routines   given   here.      These   trending   components
originate   from   both   extrinsic   and   intrinsic   sources.
Extrinsic trends arise from the rigid-body positioning of
the part under test in the measuring apparatus.  In optics
these displacement and rotation contributions are called
“piston”  and  “tilt”  errors.    In  contrast,  intrinsic  trends
arise from deliberate or accidental shape errors inherent
in the surface under test, such as a circular or parabolic
curvature.  In the absence of a-priori information about
the  true  surface  shape,  the  intrinsic  shape  error  is
frequently  limited  to  a  quadratic  (parabolic)  curvature
of  the  surface.    Detrending  of  intrinsic  and  extrinsic
trends  is  generally  accomplished  simultaneously  by
subtracting   a   detrending   polynomial   from   the   raw
measured  data,  where  the  polynomial  coefficients  are
determined  by  least-squares  fitting  to  the  measured
data.
2. 9          Although     surfaces     and     surface     measuring
instruments exist in real or configuration space, they are
most easily understood in frequency space, also known
as  Fourier  transform,  reciprocal  or  spatial-frequency
space.    This  is  because  any  practical  measurement
process  can  be  considered  to  be  a  “linear  system”,
meaning that the measured profile is the convolution of
the true surface profile and the impulse response of the
measuring   system;   and   equivalently,   the   Fourier-
amplitude   spectrum   of   the   measured   profile   is   the
product  of  that  of  the  true  profile  and  the  frequency-
dependent   “transfer   function”   of   the   measurement
system.      This   is   expressed   symbolically   by   the
following equation:</p><p>)()()(
xxtruexmeas
fTfAfA=                      (1)
where:
A =   the Fourier amplitudes,
T(f
x
)    =   instrument response function or the measure-
ment transfer function, and
f
x
=   surface spatial frequency.
This  factorization  permits  the  surface  and  the  mea-
suring  system  to  be  discussed  independently  of  each
other  in  frequency  space,  and  is  an  essential  feature  of
any discussion of measurement systems.
2. 10        Figure    1    sketches    different    forms    of    the
measurement transfer function, T(f
x
):
2. 10.1  Case  (a)  is  a  perfect  measuring  system,  which
has T ( f
x
)  =  1  for  all  spatial  frequencies,  0  ≤ f
x
≤ ∞.
This is unrealistic since no real measuring instrument is
equally sensitive to all spatial frequencies.
2. 10.2  Case (b)  is  an  ideal  measuring  system,  which
has T (f
x
)  =  1  for  LFL ≤ f
x
≤ HFL  and  T(f
x
)  =  0
otherwise,   where   LFL   and   HFL   denote   the   low-
frequency     and     high-frequency     limits     of     the
measurement.  The range LFL ≤ f
x
≤ HFL is called the
bandpass  or  bandwidth  of  the  measurement,  and  ratio
HFL/LFL    is    called    the    dynamic    range    of    the
measurement.
2. 10.3  Case (c) represents a realistic measuring system,
since  it  includes  the  fact  that  T (f
x
)  need  not  be  unity
within   the   measurement   bandpass   or   strictly   zero
outside the bandpass.
2. 11    If  the  measurement  transfer  function  is  known  to
deviate significantly from unity within the measurement
bandpass,  the  measured  power  spectral  density  (PSD)
can be transformed into the form that would have been
measured  by  an  instrument  with  the  ideal  rectangular
form  through  the  process  of  digital  “restoration.”  In  its
simplest    form    restoration    involves    dividing    the
measured PSD by the known form of
||
T
()
f
x</p><p>2
over the
measurement   bandpass.      Restoration   is   particularly
relevant  to  measuring  instruments  that  involve  optical
microscopes  since  the  transfer  functions  of  microscope
systems  are  not  unity  over  their  bandpass  but  tend  to
fall linearly between unity at T (0) = 1 and T(HFL) = 0.
The need for, and methodology of digital restoration is
instrument    specific    and    this    guide    places    no
requirements on its use.
2. 12  This guide requires that any data on surface finish
parameters  or  functions  generated  by  the  procedures
described  herein  be  accompanied  by  an  identifying
description  of  measuring  instrument  used,  estimates  of
its low- and high-frequency limits, LFL and HFL, and a
statement of whether or not restoration techniques were
used.
2. 13      In   order   to   make   a   quantitative   comparison
between     profile     data     obtained     from     different
measurement  techniques,  the  statistical  parameters  and
functions of interest must be compared over the same or
comparable   spatial-frequency   regions.      The   most
common  quantities  used  to  compare  surfaces  are  their
root-mean-square (rms) roughness values, which are the
square   roots   of   the   areas   under   the   PSD between
specified  surface-frequency  limits.    Surface  statistics
derived from measurements involving different spatial-
frequency  ranges  cannot  be  compared  quantitatively
except   in   an   approximate   way.      In   some   cases
measurements  with  partially  or  even  nonoverlapping
bandwidths  can  be  compared  by  using  analytic  models</p><p>SEMI MF1811-0704 © SEMI 2003, 2004 3
of  the  PSDs  to  extrapolate  the  PSDs  outside  their
measurement bandwidth.
2. 14    Examples  of  specific  band-width  limits  can  be
drawn  from  the  optical  and  semiconductor  industries.
In  optics  the  so-called  total  integrated  scatter  or  TIS
measurement  technique  leads  to  rms  roughness  values
involving    an    annulus    in    two-dimensional    spatial
frequencies  space  from  0.069  to  1.48  μm
–1
;  that  is,  a
dynamic  range  of  1.48/0.069  =  21/1.    In  contrast,  the
range  of  spatial  frequencies  involved  in  optical  and
mechanical  scanning  techniques  are  generally  much
larger than this, frequently having a dynamic ranges of
512/1 or more.  In the latter case the subrange of 0.0125
to  1  μm
–1
has  been  used  to  discuss  the  rms  surface
roughness   in   the   semiconductor   industry.      These
numbers  are  provided  to  illustrate  the  magnitudes  and
ranges of HFL and LFL encountered in practice but do
not constitute a recommendation of particular limits for
the  specification  of  surface  finish  parameters.    Such
selections  are  application  dependent,  and  are  to  be
made at the users&#x27; discretion.
2. 15        The    limits    of    integration    involved    in    the
determination  of  rms  roughness  and  slope  values  from
measured profile data are introduced by multiplying the
measured PSD  by  a  factor  equal  to  zero  for  spatial
frequencies  outside  the  desired  bandpass  and  unity
within  the  desired  bandpass,  as  shown  in  Case  (b)  in
Figure  1.    This  is  called  a  top-hat  or  binary  filter
function.      Before   the   ready   availability   of   digital
frequency-domain   processing   as   employed   in   this
guide,  bandwidth  limits  were  imposed  by  passing  the
profile  data  through  analog  or  digital  filters  without
explicitly transforming them into the frequency domain
and   multiplying   by   a   top-hat   function.      The   two
processes  are  mathematically  equivalent,  providing  the
data  filter  has  the  desired  frequency  response.    Real
data  filters,  however,  frequently  have  Gaussian  or  RC
forms  that  only  approximate  the  desired  top-hat  form
that  introduces  some  ambiguity  in  their  interpretation.
This   guide   recommends   the   determination   of   rms
roughness and slope values using top-hat windowing of
the measured PSD in the frequency domain.
2. 16  The PSD  and  rms  roughness  are  surface  statistics
of  particular  interest  to  the  optics  and  semiconductor
industries  because  of  their  direct  relationship  to  the
functional  properties  of  such  surfaces.    In  the  case  of
rougher   surfaces   these   are   still   valid   and   useful
statistics,  although  the  functional  properties  of  such
surfaces  may  depend  on  additional  statistics  as  well.
The   ASME   Standard   on   Surface   Texture,   B46.1,
discusses   additional   surface   statistics,   terms,   and
measurement methods applicable to machined surfaces.
2. 17    The  units  used  in  this  guide  are  a  self-consistent
set    of    SI    units    that    are    appropriate    for    many
measurements in the semiconductor and optics industry.
This guide does not mandate the use of these units, but
does  require  that  results  expressed  in  other  units  be
referenced to SI units for ease of comparison.

average over a local frequency range using a particular
weighting function.
4. 2.1.1  Discussion  —  The  averaged  quantities  must
include the same range of surface spatial frequencies.
4. 2.2  averaging,   data   —   numerical   averaging   of
statistical   estimates   of   the   PSD,   the   mean-square
surface  roughness  or  the  mean-square  profile  slope
derived from different measurements, in order to obtain
a single, composite result.
4. 2.2.1  Discussion  —  For  example,  a  rectangular  or
square  array  of  measurements  can  be  separated  into  a
set   of   parallel   profile   measurements   which   can   be
analyzed  separately  and  the  results  averaged.    Again,
the averaged quantities must include the same range of
surface spatial frequencies.
4. 2.3  bandwidth,  bandwidth  limits  —  range  of  surface
spatial   frequencies   included   in   a   measurement   or
specification.
4. 2.3.1  Discussion  —  Bandwidth  is  specified  by  a
high-frequency  limit  (HFL)  and  a  low-frequency  limit
(LFL).    The  bandwidth  and  the  measurement  transfer
function over the bandwidth must be taken into account
when    measurements    or    statistical    properties    are
compared.        Different    measuring    instruments    are
generally sensitive to different ranges of surface spatial
frequencies;   that   is,   they   have   different   bandwidth
limits.    Real  bandwidth  limits  are  necessarily  finite
since no measuring instrument is sensitive to infinitely-
low or to infinitely-high surface spatial frequencies.
4. 2.4  bias   error   —   average   deviation   between   an
estimate of a statistical quantity and its true value.
4. 2.4.1  Discussion  —  The  periodogram  estimator  of
the power spectral density (PSD) given in this guide is a
zero-bias  or  unbiased  estimator  of  the  PSD.    On  the
other  hand,  local  averaging  of  the  periodogram  can
introduce  bias  errors  in  regions  where  the  spectrum
varies rapidly with frequency.
4. 2.5  deterministic  profile  —  surface  profile  that  is  a
known  function  of  surface  position,  with  no  random
dependencies on position.
4. 2.5.1  Discussion  —  In  contrast,  a  random  profile  is
known   only   in   terms   of   a   probability   distribution
function.
4. 2.6  detrended  profile,  Z
d
(x)  —  the  raw  or  measured
profile  after  removing  instrumental  and  surface  trends.
The  detrended  profile  is  the  input  for  the  statistical
estimation routines described in Section 5.
4. 2.6.1  Discussion  —  If  the  parametric  form  of  the
trend  is  known,  its  least-squares-fitted  form  can  be
subtracted from the measured profile data.  Otherwise a
generic  power-series  form  can  be  used.    This  guide
describes  the  procedures  for  removing  a  zero-,  first-  or
second-order polynomial in the trace distance.  A zero-
order    polynomial    removes    piston;    a    first-order
polynomial removes piston and tilt; and a second-order
polynomial removes piston, tilt and quadratic curvature.
In each case the detrended data set has zero mean.  The
coefficients  of  constant  and  linear  terms  correspond  to
the  rigid-body  orientation  of  the  part  being  measured
and  need  not  be  recorded.    However,  the  coefficient  of
the  quadratic  term  represents  the  intrinsic  curvature  of
the surface being measured and should be recorded.
4. 2.7  dynamic  range  —  ratio  of  the  high-  to  low-
frequency    limits    of    the    bandwidth    of    a    given
measurement technique.
4. 2.7.1  Discussion  —  The  ratio  HFL/LFL  is  a  useful
single-number  characteristic  of  a  measuring  apparatus.
It  completely  describes  the  measurement  effects  on
surfaces with power-law power spectra.
4. 2.8  ensemble  —  infinitely  large  collection  (infinite
ensemble)  of  quantities,  the  properties  of  which  are
governed by some statistical distribution law.
4. 2.8.1  Discussion  —  For  example,  ensembles  include
surface profiles, and rms roughness values.
4. 2.9  ensemble  average  value  —  value  of  a  particular
surface   parameter   or   function   averaged   over   the
appropriate distribution functions.
4. 2.9.1  Discussion  —  The  ensemble  average  value  of
the   quantity   A   is   denoted   by   A.      Estimates   of
ensemble-average quantities based on a finite collection
of  measurements  (finite  ensemble)  can  deviate  from
their  infinite-ensemble  values  by  fluctuation  and  bias
errors.
4. 2.10  estimate    —    ensemble-average    value    of    a
roughness statistic from a finite set of measured profile
data.
4. 2.10.1  Discussion  —  In  this  guide,  a  circumflex  is
used  to  distinguish  estimates  from  the  corresponding
ensemble-average quantities (see also Section 2.6).
4. 2.11  estimator     —     algorithm     or     mathematical
procedure for calculating an “estimate.”
4. 2.12  fast  fourier  transform  or  FFT  —  algorithm  for
calculating   the   Fourier   transform   (discrete   Fourier
transform or DFT) of a set of numerical data.
4. 2.12.1  Discussion  —  The  discovery  of  the  FFT  is
generally  attributed  to  Cooley  and  Tukey,  although  it
was  used  and  reported  in  the  earlier  literature  by  a
number   of   others,   including   Gauss,   two   centuries
before.    It  is  now  ubiquitous  and  can  be  found  in  any</p><p>SEMI MF1811-0704 © SEMI 2003, 2004 5
computer  data  analysis  package  (see  Section  5.4.2  for
details).
4. 2.13  finish  parameters  and  functions  —  numbers  or
functions that characterize surface height fluctuations.
4. 2.13.1  Discussion  —  The  values  and  forms  of  finish
parameters  and  functions  may  vary  depending  on  the
bandwidth of surface frequencies that they contain, and
the shapes of the transfer functions of the measurement
instruments  involved.    These  quantities  are  represented
by    their    ensemble-average    values    derived    from
measurements  using  specific  estimation  routines.    In
general,  the  finish  parameters  and  functions  of  an  area
are  different  from  those  of  profiles  taken  across  the
surface.    In  the  case  of  surfaces  that  are  statistically
isotropic, however, the area and profile statistics have a
one-to-one relationship.  Except for incidental remarks,
this  guide  is  concerned  exclusively  with  the  properties
of surface profiles.
4. 2.14  fluctuation  error  —  general  term  denoting  the
deviation  of  a  quantity  from  its  mean,  average  or
detrended value.
4. 2.14.1  Discussion  —  Fluctuation  errors  are  usually
measured  in  terms  of  their  mean-square  or  rms  values.
For  example,  R
q
is  the  rms  fluctuation  error  in  the
surface height and ∆
q
is the rms fluctuation error in the
profile  slope.    In  turn,  the  estimates  of  R
q
and  ∆
q
have
their  own  fluctuation  errors.    The  magnitudes  of  these
higher fluctuation errors not discussed in this guide.
4. 2.15  high-frequency  limit  (HFL)  <!-- -->[1/μm]<!-- --> —  highest
spatial  frequency  contained  in  a  profile  data  set  or
specification.
4. 2.15.1  Discussion  —  The  HFL  of  a  measurement  is
determined  by  the  details  of  the  measurement  process,
and its value in specifications is determined by the user.
If  the  sampling  interval  in  the  measurement  process  is
D,  the  extreme  value  of  the  HFL  is  given  by  the
Nyquist  criterion,  HFL  =  1/(2D).    However,  other
electrical,  mechanical,  or  optical  filtering  mechanisms
may   further   limit   the   HFL.      Examples   of   such
mechanisms    are    the    stylus    tip    radius,    projected
measurement    pixel    size,    optical    resolution,    and
electrical  and  digital  filters,  all  of  which  contribute  to
the  high-frequency  roll-off  of  the  instrument  transfer
function.  If the Nyquist frequency is used to determine
the HFL, care should be taken to determine that the true
HFL is not reduced by these additional mechanisms.
4. 2.16  intrinsic    surface    or    finish    parameters    —
characteristics  such  as  the  rms  roughness  or  rms  slope
that contain all surface spatial frequencies from zero to
infinity.
4. 2.16.1  Discussion    —    Intrinsic    parameters    are
statistical   abstractions   that   cannot   be   measured   or
estimated directly since real measurements are sensitive
to  only  limited  ranges  of  surface  spatial  frequencies.
They can, however, be inferred from real measurements
by augmenting measurements with a-priori information
about   very   low   and   very   high   spatial   frequencies
contained  in  physically-based  models  of  the  PSDs  of
the  surfaces  involved.    All  measured  finish  parameters
are  finite,  but  their  corresponding  intrinsic  values  need
not be.  The important distinction between intrinsic and
measured  (band-width  limited)  finish  parameters  is  not
always made in the literature.
4. 2.17  impulse response, of a profile measuring system
—  measured  shape  of  an  impulse  or  infinitely-sharp
ridge lying perpendicularly to the profile direction.
4. 2.17.1  Discussion   —   In   the   case   of   a   linear
measuring  system  the  impulse  response  is  the  Fourier
transform of the system transfer function.  The impulse
response  of  a  perfect  measuring  system  would  be  an
infinitely sharp spike or delta function.  In contrast, the
impulse response of real measuring systems has a finite
width.
4. 2.18  isotropic   surface   —   surface   whose   intrinsic
finish  parameters  and  functions  are  independent  of  the
rotational   position   of   the   surface   about   its   surface
normal.  Also known as statistically-isotropic surface.
4. 2.18.1  Discussion  —  The  rms  roughness  of  profiles
taken    across    an    isotropically    rough    surface    is
independent  of  the  profile  directions,  and  equals  the
rms roughness of the surface area.  The rms slope of an
isotropically  rough  surface  is  also  independent  of  the
profile   direction   and   equals   1/√2   of   the   rms   area
gradient.    The  one-dimensional  or  profile  power  spec-
trum  of  an  isotropic  surface  is  also  independent  of  the
direction of the profile on the surface, and is related to
the two-dimensional spectrum of the surface area by an
integral  transform.    Examples  of  this  are  given  in
Section 4.2.41.
4. 2.19  linear  systems,  linear  measurement  system  —  a
signal-processing concept more precisely described as a
linear, shift-invariant system.
4. 2.19.1  Discussion  —  For  the  present  purposes,  a
linear  measurement  of  the  surface  profile  is  the  true
profile  convolved  with  the  impulse  response  of  the
measuring    system,    or    equivalently,    the    Fourier
amplitude  spectrum  of  the  measurement  is  the  true
amplitude  spectrum  times  the  measurement  transfer
function  as  indicated  in  Section  2.9.    All  practical
measurement  systems  are  taken  to  be  linear  over  their
operating ranges.</p><p>SEMI MF1811-0704 © SEMI 2003, 2004 6
4. 2.20  low-frequency   limit (LFL)  <!-- -->[1/μm]<!-- -->   —   lowest
spatial  frequency  contained  in  a  profile  data  set  or
specification.
4. 2.20.1  Discussion  —  The  minimum  LFL  in  a  profile
measurement  is  the  reciprocal  of  the  length  of  the
surface profile.  The estimated value of the PSD at this
value   of   the   LFL   is   generally   attenuated   by   the
detrending  process.    To  avoid  this  effect  the  lowest
practical LFL is sometimes taken to be 3 to 5 times the
reciprocal  of  the  scan  length.    The  LFL  in  surface
specifications is determined by the user.
4. 2.21  mean-square  profile  roughness,  R
q
2
<!-- -->[nm
2
]<!-- -->  —
ensemble-average  value  of  the  square  of  the  height  of
the detrended profile.

assumes that the average slope has been removed in the
detrending  process.    The  integrand  in  the  frequency
integral  on  the  right  can  be  viewed  as  the  slope  power
spectral  density.    The  mean-square  surface  slope  of  an
isotropically-rough  two-dimensional  surface  is  half  the
mean-square gradient of the surface itself.
4. 2.23  measured  profile  parameters  and  functions  —
quantities   derived   from   detrended   profile   data   that
include  the  bandwidth  and  transfer  function  effects  of
the particular measurement system used.
4. 2.23.1  Discussion  —  Measured  profile  parameters
and   functions   can   be   used   for   comparing   surfaces
quality providing the same measurement system is used
in   all   cases.      In   order   to   compare   quantitative
measurements made by different measurement systems,
or  to  estimate  intrinsic  surface  properties,  the  system
bandwidths  and  transfer  functions  must  be  taken  into
account.    In  the  early  literature,  measurement  systems
were  taken  to  be  “perfect”  in  the  sense  of  Section
2. 10.1,  and  the  effects  of  their  bandwidths  and  transfer
functions were ignored.
4. 2.24  Nyquist  frequency  <!-- -->[1/μm]<!-- -->  —  spatial  frequency
equal  to  the  reciprocal  of  twice  the  sampling  interval.
See Section 4.2.15.1.
4. 2.24.1  Discussion     —     The     Nyquist     frequency
represents the highest undistorted frequency involved in
a   series   of   uniformly-spaced   profile   measurements.
Higher-frequency  components  in  the  surface  appear  at
lower-frequencies   through   the   process   of   aliasing.
Unless  the  effects  of  aliasing  are  removed  by  anti-
aliasing  mechanisms  in  the  measurement  process,  they
corrupt  the  measured  spectrum  immediately  below  the
Nyquist  frequency.    In  that  case  the  HFL  should  be
taken  to  be  a  factor  of  3  to  5  below  the  Nyquist
frequency.
4. 2.25  periodic random roughness — modified version
of   purely   periodic   roughness   that   has   a   definite
fundamental spatial frequency, but random variations in
its phase or amplitude (see Section 4.2.26).
4. 2.26  periodic roughness — roughness with a definite
fundamental spatial frequency.
4. 2.26.1  Discussion  —  The  power  spectra  of  periodic
and periodic random roughness appear as isolated peaks
in  the  power  spectral  density  function.    This  pattern  is
distinct  from  the  broad  variations  appearing  for  purely
random  surfaces.    Random  surfaces  can  be  viewed  as
periodic  surfaces  with  a  broad  distribution  of  funda-
mental periods.
4. 2.27  periodogram estimate — estimates of particular
finish parameters that are derived from the periodogram
estimator for the power spectrum.
4. 2.28  periodogram estimator — a particular estimator
for the power spectral density that is proportional to the
square  magnitude  of  the  discrete  Fourier  transform  of
the detrended data set.
4. 2.28.1.1  Discussion   —   The   periodogram   is   the
estimator  for  the  PSD  that  is  used  in  this  guide.    The
signal-processing   literature   contains   many   different
estimators  of  the  power  spectrum  in  addition  to  the</p><p>SEMI MF1811-0704 © SEMI 2003, 2004 7
periodogram.      In   general,   they   differ   from   the
periodogram in that they incorporate different types and
degrees     of     a-priori     physical     or     mathematical
information    about    the    original    data    set.        The
periodogram,   in   contrast,   includes   the   maximum
number  of  degrees  of  freedom  and  is  always  used  for
first-cut   evaluation   and   analysis.      Details   of   the
correlation  and  other  spectral  estimation  methods  are
discussed  in  the  literature  listed  in  Section  7.    A
mathematical  variant  of  the  periodogram  estimator  is
the correlation method.  This is a two-step process that
requires  the  estimation  of  an  intermediate  function,  the
autocovariance    function,    which    is    then    Fourier
transformed  to  obtain  the  periodogram  estimate  of  the
power  spectrum.    This  method  is  not  discussed  in  this
guide  since  it  is  indirect,  but  when  properly  applied
gives identically the same results as the direct transform
method recommended in this guide.
4. 2.29  power   spectral   density   (PSD)   —   statistical
function  that  shows  how  the  mean-square  (rms)
2
of  a
given quantity is distributed among the various surface
spatial  frequencies  inherent  in  the  profile  height.    Also
known as power spectrum.
4. 2.29.1  Discussion — The two conventional measures
of  surface  roughness,  R
a
and  R
q
do  not  carry  any
information  about  the  transverse  scale  of  the  surface
roughness.  That is, they are independent of how much
the  surface  profile  is  squeezed  or  stretched  parallel  to
the surface plane.  The PSD is the simplest statistic that
carries that important additional information.

4. 2.30.1  Discussion   —   When   the   radius   us   large
relative  to  the  profile  length  its  magnitude  is  most
easily   determined   from   the   quadratic   term   in   the

Since  the  radii  of  curvature  of  nominally  flat  surfaces
can be quite large, other reporting units, such as meters
or kilometers, may be more appropriate.
4. 2.31  random surface profile — surface height profile
that  involves  parameters  that  are  distributed  according
to  statistical  distribution  laws  rather  than  having  fixed</p><p>SEMI MF1811-0704 © SEMI 2003, 2004 8
or   deterministic   values.      Also   known   as   random
roughness.
4. 2.31.1  Discussion — For example, the profile</p><p>)2cos()(φ+π=xfAxZ

(7)
is  deterministic  if  φ  =  const.,  but  random  if  φ  has  a
finite-width probability distribution function P(φ).  Fin-
ish parameters and functions such as Z(x)
2
, are then the
values of those quantities averaged over P(φ).
4. 2.32  restoration  —  signal-processing  procedure  in
which  measurements  are  compensated  for  a  non-unit
measurement transfer function by passing them through
a  digital  filter  that  restores  the  effective  measurement
function to unity over its bandpass.
4. 2.32.1  Discussion  —  The  measured  profile  can  be
restored  and  the  statistics  of  the  restored  profile  can
then  be  estimated.    The  most  common  spatial-  and
frequency-domain   filters   used   for   this   purpose   are
“inverse”  and  “Wiener”  filters.    This  guide  does  not
discuss  the  details  of  such  restoration  processes,  which
may  be  found  in  standard  signal-processing  texts  such
as those listed in Section 7.
4. 2.33  RMS profile roughness, R
q
, <!-- -->[nm]<!-- --> — square root
of the mean-square profile roughness.
4. 2.34  RMS  profile  slope,  ∆
q
—  square  root  of  the
mean-square profile slope.
4. 2.34.1  Discussion  —  The  slope  is  dimensionless,
although the fundamental unit is the radian.  In practice
it may be convenient to express the rms slope of highly
polished surfaces in microradians.
4. 2.35  sample  interval,  D,  <!-- -->[μm]<!-- --> —  distance  between
adjacent measurements of the surface height along the x
axis.  Also known as sampling interval.
4. 2.35.1  Discussion  —  The  sample  interval  is  usually
chosen  or  recommended  by  the  manufacturer  of  the
profile  instrument  being  used.    The  sample  interval
defines  the  Nyquist  frequency  and  hence,  the  extreme
HFL of the measurement.  This guide does not address
measurements  with  unequal  sample  intervals  or  those
made along nonlinear traces over the surface.
4. 2.36  sampled  profile,  Z(x

samples,</p><p>NnDnx

,,2,1,)1(L=−=                     (8)
Therefore  the  distance  between  the  first  and  last  points

condenses   the   data   into   a   few   intrinsic   surface

model is sometimes called the K-correlation model, and
the quantity B/(2π), the correlation length.

sometimes  referred  to  as  the  spectral  strength,  and  the

4. 2.41.4    The  fractal  model  is  the  limiting  case  of  the
ABC model when the finish parameter B becomes very
large.    The  value  of  the  intrinsic  mean-square  profile

which  is  finite  for  C  &gt;  1.    The  intrinsic  value  of  the
mean-square  roughness  of  the  fractal  model  is  always
infinite   because   of   its   divergence   at   low   spatial
frequencies.      In   contrast,   the   measured   roughness
values,  obtained  by  integrating  only  over  the  measure-
ment  bandpass,  are  finite  for  the  ABC  model  for  any
value of C, and for the fractal model.
4. 2.41.5    A  third  example  of  a  spectral  model  is  the
periodic  model,  which  is  for  a  surface  consisting  of  a

In  contrast,  the  measured  value  is  the  right-hand  side

4. 2.41.6    Finally,  it  is  possible  to  develop  a  composite
model  that  is  made  up  of  a  sum  of  terms  involving
different models or models with different parameters, or
both.

D         =          1     the     sampling     interval     (see     Section
4. 2.15.1).
The   periodogram   estimate   is   based   on   a   Fourier
representation   of   the   surface   profile.      The   basic
periodicity  of  that  expansion  is  ND  rather  than  the
literal  profile  length  L  =  (N–1)D.    Depending  on  the
type of FFT used in the practical evaluation of the PSD,
N  may  be  required  to  be  a  power  of  2,  such  as  1024,
although  in  general,  there  is  no  restriction  on  N  in  this
guide.
4. 2.43  transfer    function    —    function    of    spatial
frequency  having  a  magnitude  between  zero  and  one
which  describes  the  sensitivity  of  a  linear  measuring
system  to  the  amplitudes  of  different  spatial-frequency
components in the profile being measured.  Also known
as measurement transfer function.
4. 2.43.1  Discussion  —  The  ideal  transfer  function  is
unity  within  the  measurement  bandpass  and  zero  for
frequencies    outside    the    bandpass.        Real-world
measurement      transfer      functions      can      deviate
significantly  from  this.    The  transfer  function  is  the
Fourier  transform  of  the  impulse  response  function  of
the measuring apparatus.
4. 2.44  uniaxial  surface  —  surface  whose  roughness  is
confined to a particular direction or lay, so that it can be
completely   characterized   by   profile   measurements
perpendicular to the lay direction.  Surfaces that display
harmonic lines are frequently uniaxial.  Also known as
grating-like surface.
4. 2.44.1  Discussion — In contrast, an isotropic surface
can   also   be   completely   characterized   by   profile
measurements  made  in  one  direction,  but  there  is  no
preferred  direction  as  there  is  for  uniaxial  surfaces.
Surfaces  that  are  neither  uniaxial  nor  isotropic  can  be
characterized  using  the  procedures  described  in  this
guide,  although  profile  measurements  taken  on  many
directions across the surface may be needed to generate
a  complete  statistical  description  of  the  surface  under
test.
4. 2.45  window   function,   W(x
n
)   —   bell-shaped   or
smooth-edged  function  that  multiplies  the  detrended
profile  data  set  before  it  is  inserted  into  the  period-
ogram estimation routine.  Also known as data window.
4. 2.45.1  Discussion     —     The     window     function
“smoothes  out”  possible  discontinuities  at  the  ends  of
the measured, finite-length data set in order to eliminate
the   spurious   oscillations   that   those   discontinuities
would  otherwise  generate  in  the  spectral  estimate.    As
long  as  the  window  function  performs  its  function  of
reducing  the  contributions  from  the  ends  of  the  data
record and has the proper normalization, its shape is of
secondary importance.
4. 2.46  zero   padding   —   procedure   of   adding   zero
values  to  a  data  set  to  bring  the  total  number  of  data
points, N, to a power of two to facilitate the evaluation
of   the   FFT   appearing   in   the   periodogram   spectral
estimate.
4. 2.46.1  Discussion  —  The  window  functions  should
be  applied  to  the  data  set  before  zero  padding.    Zero
padding  is  less  important  with  the  ready  availability  of
arbitrary- N FFT computing packages.
5 Calculations
5. 1  Detrending
5. 1.1  Introduction  —  The  estimators  defined  in  this

consisting  of  N  discrete  values  of  the  surface  profile
Z(x
n
=  (n–1)D)  measured  at  equally-spaced  locations
along  a  straight  line  of  length  L,  where  n  =  1  to  N.    If
Z(n)  is  the  measured  profile,  the  detrended  profile  is
given by:</p><p>][)()(

polynomial  coefficients  a,  b,  and  c,  denoted  by

, b

,
and
c

,  respectively,  are  determined  by  least-squares
fitting of the polynomial to the measured profile data as
now   described.      The   degree   of   the   detrending
polynomial  is  chosen  by  the  following  considerations:
Removing  piston  only  (zeroth-order  polynomial,  a)  is
useful  for  instructional  purposes  but  is  inadequate  in
practice.  It affects only the zero-frequency or “dc” term
in the power spectral density.  Removing piston and tilt
(first-order   polynomial,   a + b·n)   is   sufficient   for
removing  uncertainties  in  the  rigid-body  positioning  of
a  nominally  flat  sample  in  the  measurement  apparatus.
Removing   piston,   tilt   and   curvature   (second-order
polynomial, a  +  b·n  +  c·n
2
)  removes  an  additional
quadratic  term  in  the  profile  that  may  result  from
instrumental   (extrinsic)   effects   or   true   (intrinsic)
curvature in the surface being measured.

5. 2  RMS Roughness
5. 2.1    There  are  two  different  estimators  for  the  rms
roughness, R

— one expressed in configuration space,
and the other in frequency space, as follows:</p><h1>∑</h1><p>=

)
(28)
1 where
)(

mS
)
is the periodogram estimate of the PSD
based on
)(ndZ
)
(see Section 5.4).
NOTE 4:  These   two   estimates   of R
q
2
are   mathematically
identical  if  the  periodogram  is  evaluated  using  a  unit  data
window, W(n)  =  1.    Although  a  unit  window  function  is  not
recommended  for  general  use,  the  numerical  identity  of  the
Equation 27 and Equation 28 in that case offers a convenient
check on the programming of the periodogram estimator.
NOTE 5:  If a non-unit data window is used in the calculation
of the PSD the two estimates of the rms roughness given will
not,  in  general,  be  numerically  identical  for  a  particular  pro-
file  measurement.    On  the  other  hand,  the  two  estimates  are
identical for an ensemble average over a large number of pro-
file  measurements.    In  other  words,  the  two  estimates  of  R
q
2</li></ul><p>are statistically the same.
NOTE 6:  The first estimator has the advantage of familiarity
and  simplicity  since  it  is  expressed  directly  in  terms  of  the
detrended  values  of  the  measured  profile  data.    Its  disad-
vantage  is  that  it  involves,  perforce,  the  transfer  function  of
the  measuring  apparatus,  and  in  a  nonobvious  way.    In  con-
trast,  the  frequency-space  form  may  be  more  complicated  to
evaluate but has the advantage that it permits the bandwidth to
be  included  in  the  rms  value  to  be  varied  by  selecting  the
range of m values included in the frequency sum.  In addition,
it  permits  the  effects  of  a  non-unit  instrumental  transfer
function within that bandpass to be examined directly, and to
be  divided  out  by  restoration  processes,  if  its  form  is  known
independently.
NOTE  7:    The  spectra  of  real  surfaces  frequently  tend  to
diverge at low spatial frequencies so that the values of the rms
roughness  obtained  using  either  estimator  may  depend  signi-
ficantly on the value of the LFL of the measurement process,
or chosen as a reference value.  In some cases, the presence of
a  non-vanishing  LFL  can  give  a  finite  value  of  the  profile
roughness when its intrinsic value is infinite or undefined.</p><p>SEMI MF1811-0704 © SEMI 2003, 2004 12
5. 3  RMS Slope
5. 3.1    There  are  two  different  estimators  for  the  rms
slope, ∆

NOTE    8:        The    magnitudes    of    these    two    estimates    are
generally   different   since   the   first   treats   the   profile   as   a
collection     of     straight-line     segments     connecting     the
measurement  points,  while  the  second  connects  them  with  a
bandwidth-limited  interpolation  curve  and  involves  a  smaller
bias error.
NOTE  9:    The  notes  for  the  rms  roughness  estimators  just
made   generally   apply   to   slope   estimates   as   well.      One
difference  is  that  the  significant  bandwidth  effects  on  the
slope  occur  principally  at  the  HFL  rather  than  the  LFL  as  is
the case for rms roughness measurements.</li></ul><ol start="5"><li>4  Periodogram   Estimators   of   the   Profile   Power

NOTE  10:    Equation  33  applies  for  the  conventional  case  of
even N.  Different forms apply for odd N.
NOTE 11:  The case m = 1 corresponds to the zero-frequency
or  dc  component  of  the  detrended  surface  profile  and  m  =  2
corresponds   to   the   spatial   frequency   1/(ND),   which   is
essentially the reciprocal of the trace length, ( N–1)D.  On the
opposite extreme, the frequency corresponding to m = 1 + N/2
is  the  Nyquist  frequency,  1/(2D).    The  extreme  range  of
surface wavelengths included in the measurement is therefore
1/(ND)  &lt;  f  &lt;  1/(2D).    In  other  words,  the  extreme  LFL =
1/(ND), the extreme HFL = 1/(2D), and the dynamic range of
the measurement is N/2.
NOTE  12:    A  convenient  and  readable  reference  to  the  FFT
and  its  evaluation  is  Chapter  12  in  Numerical  Recipes  by
Press, Flannery, Teukolsky, and Vetterling (see Section 7.1).
NOTE 13:  The Brookhaven National Laboratory Report (see
Section 7.2) contains further background information on these
procedures  along  with  a  computer  program  and  numerical
examples.    (The  BASIC  routines  used  there  involve  different
forms  for  the  quantities  M
P
appearing  in  the  expressions  for
the detrending polynomials than those discussed in this guide,
although  the  numerical  values  of  the  detrending  polynomials
are identical in both cases.)
NOTE  14:    The  periodogram  estimator  just  given  is  not  the
only  method  of  estimating  the  power  spectral  density  from  a
set  of  profile  data,  but  it  is  the  most  direct  and  common
method.    It  is  sufficient  for  general  use,  and  is  a  necessary
first  step  to  be  taken  before  adding  embellishments  such  as
post-processing  or  considering  more  complicated  estimators.
This  guide  does  not  exclude  the  use  of  post-processing  or
alternative methods of analysis, but does require that the basic
periodogram   estimates   just   described   be   included   in   the
discussion for comparative purposes.

importance   for   randomly-rough   surfaces   as   long   as   it
smoothes  the  data  at  the  ends  of  the  data  record.    The
rectangular  or  Daniell  window  does  not  do  this,  but  is  useful
for numerical checking.
NOTE  18:    In  the  case  of  profiles  with  a  smooth  PSD,  the
principal  effect  the  window  shape  is  to  change  the  fine-scale
fluctuations in the periodogram estimate without changing its
ensemble-average value, except, perhaps, near the LFL.
NOTE  19:    In  the  case  of  profiles  involving  periodicities,  the
window  shape  can  change  the  shape  of  the  sharp  lines  in  the
PSD,  albeit  without  changing  their  areas.    The  choice  of  the
window  shape  then  involves  a  trade-off  between  line  width
and smoothness.  The raised Hann or Blackman windows are
recommended for general use.
NOTE 20:  If    the    estimation routines    are    applied    to
deterministic profiles, such as individual steps, pits, or bumps,
a  data  window  must  still  be  used  to  minimize  effects  of  the
finite data record, but the object should be placed in the center
of the profile where the window function is relatively flat.
5. 7  Zero Padding

statistical  properties  can  each  be  averaged  together  to
obtain composite results.  In the case of homogeneously
and  isotropically  rough  surfaces  the  profiles  can  lie  in
any position and direction on the surface under test.  In
the  case  of  homogeneously  but  anisotropically  rough
surfaces they can lie anywhere on the surface but must
lie parallel with each other, preferably perpendicular to
the  surface  axis.    Averaging  data  lowers  the  errors
associated with individual measurements.

random  number  generator  corresponding  to  a  constant
PSD  and  are  not  the  results  of  an  actual  measurement.
In addition, the number of data points has been limited
to N = 32 and the profile heights have been rounded to
digits  with  magnitudes  less  than  100  to  simplify  their
manual input into the users’ programs.
6. 3  Actual measured data sets would generally involve
many  more  data  points  with  height  values  involving  a
larger  number  of  significant  digits,  and  with  different
orders   of   magnitude   than   those   used   in   this   test
sequence.
6. 4  In order to provide a means for checking the proper
inclusion  of  the  sampling  distance,  D,  in  the  spectral-
estimation routines, the value D = 0.1 has been used.

these estimates depend on the data window used.  Table
2  uses  a  rectangular  window  and  Table  3  uses  the
Blackman window.
6. 6    The  dimensions  of  the  power  spectral  densities  in
these tables is length-cubed = (units of Z)

1  Purpose</p><ol><li><p>1    Organics  are  present  in  many  materials,  such  as
plastics,  lubricants,  cleansers,  soaps,  and  living  tissues.
Some  of  these  compounds  are  volatile  and  others  can
become  airborne  through  chemical  reactions,  heating,
abrasion,  or  outgassing.    Also  they  can  transfer  to
wafers  by  direct  contact  or  be  left  behind  from  solvent
residues.    Once  present  in  clean  facilities,  they  can
deposit  on  wafer  surfaces.    Organics  deposited  on
wafers   can   cause   degradation   haze,   wafer   surface
tension  changes,  irregular  oxidation  rates,  and  other
effects,  such  as  counter-doping  by  organophosphorus
compounds.      Identification   of   trace   level   organic
contaminants  is  important  in  determining  the  source  of
the  particular  contamination.    These  test  methods  use
the   TD-GC   technique   to   characterize   and   quantify
organics deposited on wafer surfaces.</p></li><li><p>2      Monitoring   of   organic   contamination   on   wafer
surfaces   also   can   be   used   to   measure   material
outgassing    for    proper    selection    of    cleanroom,
construction, and wafer packaging materials.
2  Scope</p></li><li><p>1    These  test  methods  cover  the  identification  and
quantification of organic contaminants on silicon wafer
surfaces using a gas chromatograph interfaced to a mass
spectrometer   (GC-MS)   or   a   phosphorus   selective
detector, or both.</p></li><li><p>2    These  test  methods  describe  the  apparatus  and
related  procedures  for  sample  preparation  and  analyses
by thermal desorption gas chromatography (TD-GC).
1
,
2</p></li><li><p>3  The range of detection limits of these test methods
depends on the target organic compounds, for example,
the range of detection limits is from the subpicogram to
the  nanogram  level  of  hydrocarbons  (C
8
to  C
28
)  per
square centimeter of silicon wafer surface.</p></li></ol><p>1  Fergason, L.A., ìAnalysis of Organic Impurities on Silicon Wafer

wafers, or silicon wafers with oxide films.
2. 5      Two   methods   are   described.      Method   A   is

on  full  wafers.    The  detailed  procedures  of  Method  A
and Method B as well as the differences between them,
are described in Sections 5  and 7 .
2. 6  Suitable safety precautions must be followed when
handling    organic    solvents    and    compounds,    hot
materials subjected to propane flame, the propane flame
itself,  wafer  thermal  desorption  systems,  rapid  thermal
annealer, or a high temperature furnace.

4. 2.1.1  Discussion  —  In  Method  A,  surface  organic
contaminants   are   desorbed   with   a   rapid   thermal
annealer  or  a  high  temperature  furnace.    In  Method  B
surface  organic  contaminants  are  desorbed  by  purging
them  out  in  the  heated  quartz  chamber  unit  while
helium gas is flowing as a purge gas.
5  Summary of Test Methods
5. 1  Method A
5. 1.1  Desorption  and  GC  Analysis  ó  The  volatile
organic  contaminants  on  a  wafer  surface  are  desorbed
thermally  from  the  wafer  surface  in  a  wafer  desorption
oven  and  swept  into  a  sample  thermal  desorption  tube.
The sample thermal desorption tube then is heated for a
set period in the thermal desorption unit and the volatile
organic contaminants desorbed from the sample thermal
desorption  tube  are  swept  by  a  stream  of  helium  to  a
cold trap where they are preconcentrated.  At the end of
this period, the cold trap is heated rapidly to release the
trapped  organics  to  the  GC  column  head.    Sample
components then are separated and eluted out of the GC
column.  Then, a portion goes to a phosphorus selective
detector and the remainder goes to a mass spectrometer
(MS).    Blank  wafers  are  prepared  by  purging  out  any
surface   organic   contaminants   in   a   rapid   thermal
annealer  or  a  high  temperature  furnace  while  a  purge
gas is flowing.
5. 1.2  Identification  of  Contaminants  ó  Identification
of  individual  unknown  compounds  is  performed  by
correspondence  of  retention  time  of  their  peaks  with
that  of  known  compounds.    Correspondence  of  reten-
tion time on a single column should not be regarded as
proof   of   identity.      More   precise   identification   of
individual  unknown  compounds  is  performed  with  MS
by  matching  their  fragmentation  patterns  with  mass
spectra of known compounds in the spectral library.
5. 1.3  Quantification ó Quantification of total organics
is  based  on  the  comparison  of  the  integrated  total  peak
area  of  the  sample  peaks  with  the  area  of  the  external
standard compound, n-C
16
H
34
.  Total organophosphorus
content  in  a  sample  is  quantified  by  comparing  the
sample  signal  integrated  from  the  phosphorus  selective
detector  with  the  signal  of  the  phosphorus  standard
compound,  tris  (2-chloroethyl)  phosphate  (TCEP)  or
tributyl phosphate (TBP).  Specified range of standards
is measured periodically, and the result is reported with
blank wafer data.
5. 2  Method B
5. 2.1  Desorption  and  GC  Analysis  ó  The  volatile
organic  contaminants  on  a  wafer  surface  are  desorbed
thermally  from  the  wafer  surface  in  a  quartz  chamber
unit and swept into a glass TD tube.  The glass TD tube
then  is  heated  for  a  set  period  and  a  stream  of  helium
sweeps the volatile organic contaminants desorbed from
the   glass   TD   tube   to   a   cold   trap   where   they   are
preconcentrated.  At the end of this period, the cold trap
is  heated  rapidly  to  release  the  trapped  organics  to  the
GC  column  head.    Sample  components  then  are  sepa-
rated and eluted out of the GC column.  Then, a portion
goes   to   a   phosphorus   selective   detector   and   the
remainder  goes  to  a  mass  spectrometer  (MS).    Blank
wafers are prepared by purging out any surface organic
contaminants  in  the  heated  quartz  chamber  unit,  while
helium gas is flowing as a purge gas.
5. 2.2  Identification  of  Contaminants  ó  Identification
of  individual  unknown  compounds  is  performed  by
correspondence  of  retention  time  of  their  peaks  with
that    of    known    compounds.        Correspondence    of
retention   time   on   a   single   column   should   not   be
regarded   as   a   proof   of   identity.      More   precise
identification   of   individual   unknown   compounds   is
performed  with  MS  by  matching  their  fragmentation
patterns with mass spectra of known compounds in the
spectral library.
5. 2.3  Quantification ó Quantification of total organics
is  based  on  the  comparison  of  the  integrated  total  peak
area  of  the  sample  peaks  with  the  area  of  the  external
standard compound, n-C
16
H
34
.  Total organophosphorus
content  in  a  sample  is  quantified  by  comparing  the
sample  signal  integrated  from  a  phosphorus  selective
detector  with  the  signal  of  the  phosphorus  standard
compound,  tris  (2-chloroethyl)  phosphate  (TCEP)  or
tributyl phosphate (TBP).  Specified range of standards
is measured periodically, and the result is reported with
blank wafer data.
6  Apparatus
6. 1  Method A
6. 1.1  GC  Instrument  ó  Utilizes  a  capillary  column  to
separate  a  wide  variety  of  organic  compounds  coupled
to a mass spectrometer (MS), or a phosphorus selective
detector,  or  both.    Examples  of  phosphorus  selective
detectors  are  flame  photometric  detector  (FPD),  and</p><p>SEMI MF1982-1103 © SEMI 2003 3
atomic       emission       detector       (AED).              The
nitrogen/phosphorus    thermionic    ionization    detector
(NPD)     also     responds     to     nitrogen     containing
compounds.
NOTE     1:          A     nitrogen/phosphorus     thermionic     ionization
detector  (NPD)  may  also  be  used  as  a  phosphorus  selective
detector.    This  type  of  detector  also  responds  to  nitrogen
containing   compounds.      If   an   NPD   is   used,   the   total
organophosphorus reported should exclude any signals due to
nitrogen  containing  compounds.    Often,  identification  from
the mass spectra can be used to determine whether compound
contains nitrogen or phosphorus, or both.
6. 1.2  Sample  Thermal  Desorption  Tubes  ó  Stainless-
steel  tubes  packed  with  adsorbent  medium,  are  used  to
trap  compounds  of  interest  and  release  them  onto  a
thermal desorption unit.
NOTE  2:    Note  that  stainless  steel  is  catalytically  active  and
can    corrode    with    time,    affecting    recovery    for    some
compounds.  In this case, deactivated stainless steel, glass, or
quartz  tubes  also  can  be  used.    Several  adsorbent  materials
can  be  used  for  trapping  organic  compounds  desorbed  from
silicon  wafer  samples.    Some  examples  are  activated  carbon,
graphitized    carbon,    and    poly    (2,6-diphenyl-p-phenylene
oxide).
6. 1.3  Thermal   Desorption   Unit   ó   Used   to   desorb
organics  from  sample  thermal  desorption  tubes.    The
thermal desorption unit is coupled to the GC instrument
via a heated transfer line, for example, heated to 225∞C
or above.
6. 1.4  Thermal   Annealer   ó   Or   a   high   temperature
furnace  used  to  obtain  a  blank  wafer  (see  Section
7. 1.1.2 ).
6. 1.5  Temperature    Controllable    Wafer    Desorption
Oven ó Used to hold and heat a wafer desorption tube.
6. 1.6  Wafer  Desorption  Tube  ó  Stainless-steel  tube
with  an  approximate  dimension:  12.7  mm  (0.5  in.)  in
outer  diameter,  9.53  mm  (0.375  in.)  in  inner  diameter
and  254  mm  (10  in.)  in  length  (see  Figure  1),  used  to
desorb organics from cleaved wafers.  Larger tubes may
be  used  for  larger  wafer  sizes  and  to  increase  the
sensitivity of the test (see Note 2).
6. 1.7  Analytical Balance
6. 1.8  Quartz Plate and Carbide-Tipped Scribe — Used
to cleave wafer samples.
6. 1.9  Quick Connect ó Used to connect a nitrogen line
to the wafer desorption tube.
6. 2  Method B
6. 2.1  GC  Instrument  ó  Utilizes  a  capillary  column  to
separate a wide variety of organic compounds, coupled
to  a  mass  spectrometer  (MS)  or  a  phosphorus  selective
detector,  or  both.    Examples  of  phosphorus  selective
detectors are flame photometric detector (FPD), atomic
emission    detector    (AED),    or    nitrogen/phosphorus
thermionic     ionization     detector     (NPD).          The
nitrogen/phosphorus    thermionic    ionization    detector
(NPD) also responds to nitrogen containing compounds
(see Note 1).
6. 2.2  Quartz Chamber Unit ó Used to desorb organic
contaminants  from  the  wafer  surface  and  transfer  them
to a glass TD tube (see Figure 2).
6. 2.3  Quartz  Chamber  —  May  be  used  also  to  purge
out any organic contaminants from a blank wafer.
6. 2.4  Glass   TD   Tube   —   Packed   with   adsorbent
medium used to trap compounds of interest and release
them onto a cold trap.  Several adsorbent materials can
be used for trapping organic compounds desorbed from
silicon  wafer  samples.    Some  examples  are  activated
carbon,  graphitized  carbon,  and  poly  (2,6-diphenyl-p-
phenylene oxide).
6. 2.5  Cold   Trap   ó   Used   to   concentrate   organics
desorbed from glass TD tube and release the organics to
a GC instrument by rapid heating.
7  Procedure
7. 1  Method A
7. 1.1  Sample Handling and Preparation
7. 1.1.1  At all times, avoid manual handling of samples
for analysis to prevent any secondary contamination of
samples.      Use   stainless   steel   tweezers   for   sample
preparation.    Use  a  propane  torch  to  flame  stainless
steel  tweezers,  weigh  boats,  and  other  accessories  that
come  into  direct  contact  with  the  sample  before  their
usage.
7. 1.1.2    Thermally  debsorb  any  organics  from  blank
wafers in a rapid thermal annealer or a high temperature
furnace.    In  order  to  desorb  any  organics  from  blank
wafers,  the  temperature  of  a  rapid  thermal  annealer  is
kept  at  900∞C  for  15  s,  or  the  temperature  of  a  high
temperature   furnace   is   kept   at   700∞C   for   30   min.
Heating  under  air  or  oxygen  will  make  a  consistent
organic-free  SiO
2
surface.    Place  the  thermally  treated
blank  wafers  directly  into  petri  dishes  and  wrap  the
dishes with organic-free aluminum foil.
7. 1.2  Wafer Desorption
7. 1.2.1          Clean     and     precondition     sample     thermal
desorption  tubes  in  accordance  with  ASTM  Practice
D 6196 prior to attaching to the wafer desorption tube.
7. 1.2.2  Turn on the temperature controller for the wafer
desorption  oven  and  wait  for  the  temperature  to  reach
275∞C.</p><p>SEMI MF1982-1103 © SEMI 2003 4
7. 1.2.3  Cleave the wafer sample into strips about 5 to 7
mm  wide  by  scribing  a  line  on  the  wafer  where  one
wants  it  to  break  and  then  placing  it  on  a  straight  wire
and  breaking  it  along  the  scribed  line.    The  portion  of
the  wafer  sample  needed  for  the  analysis  changes  with
the  size  of  the  wafer.    For  a  100-mm  wafer,  about  half
of  its  surface  area  is  needed.    Larger  samples  (having
larger   surface   area)   may   be   used   to   increase   the
sensitivity of the test.
7. 1.2.4    Place  the  wafer  strips  of  wafer  into  the  wafer
desorption  tube.    Attach  a  sample  thermal  desorption
tube  to  the  side  of  the  wafer  desorption  tube.    Connect
the other end of the wafer desorption tube to a nitrogen
line with a flow of 15 to 100 mL/min.
7. 1.2.5  Place the wafer desorption tube in the oven and
heat  it  for  30  min  at  275∞C.    This  allows  the  volatile
organics  to  be  thermally  desorbed  from  the  sample
wafer  and  transferred  to  the  sample  thermal  desorption
tube.
7. 1.2.6  Seal both ends of the sample thermal desorption
tube into the thermal desorption unit or by using caps if
the thermal desorption-GC system is automated.  Tubes
must  not  be  left  open  and  exposed  to  the  laboratory
atmosphere.  The end caps should be made of a material
that  has  low  outgassing  and  low  reactivity  properties,
such  as  poly  tetrafluoroethylene  (PTFE),  or  stainless
steel.
7. 1.2.7    Analyze  a  blank  wafer  at  least  daily.    Use  a
blank wafer treated with the same desorption procedure
just described.  Report blank data with the sample data.
7. 1.3  GC Analysis
7. 1.3.1      Place   the   sample   thermal   desorption   tube,
which contains organic contaminants desorbed from the
wafer,  onto  the  thermal  desorption  unit.    Enter  the
sample information into the computer, and start the GC
analysis.
7. 1.3.2  Flow the helium carrier gas through the sample
thermal   desorption   tube   during   primary   desorption.
Heat the sample thermal desorption tube and sweep out
the  target  organics  contained  in  the  sample  to  a  cold
trap     where     they     are     preconcentrated.          Two
recommended    conditions    for    heating    the    sample
desorption  tube  are  as  follows.    When  graphitized
carbon  is  used  as  adsorbent  material,  heat  the  tube  to
400∞C and hold at 400∞C for 15 min.  When poly (2,6-
diphenyl-p-phenylene   oxide)   is   used   as   adsorbent
material,  heat  the  tube  to  270∞C  and  hold  at  270∞C  for
15  min.    Cold  trap  parameters,  that  is,  sorbent,  sold
temperature, etc., should be selected such that all target
analytes  are  retained  quantitatively  throughout  the  tube
desorption  process,  for  example,  using  a  cold  trap
temperature of −30∞C.  Refer to ASTM Practice D 6196
for   a   method   for   testing   desorption   efficiency   and
analyte  recovery.    At  the  end  of  this  period,  heat  the
cold trap rapidly to 300∞C to release the target organics
to the GC column head.
NOTE  3:    For  higher  sensitivity  analysis,  larger  sample  sizes
can be used, but clogging by water is possible.  In this case, a
subambient  cold  trap  with  an  adsorbent  may  be  used  and
maintained higher than 0∞C during trapping to prevent freeze-
up of trap.
7. 1.3.3    Separate  volatile  organics  desorbed  from  the
sample   thermal   desorption   tube   by   an   appropriate
column   temperature   program.      Two   recommended
temperature   programs   are   as   follows.      For   high
resolution  analysis,  using  polydimethylsiloxane-coated
column (60 m by 0.25 mm by 0.25ñμm film thickness),
heat the column from 40 to 280∞C at a rate of 10∞C/min
and  hold  the  temperature  at  280  ∞C  for  16  min.    For
rapid    analysis,    using    polydimethylsiloxane-coated
column (25 m by 0.32 mm by 0.52ñμm film thickness),
heat   the   column   from   30   to   265∞C   at   a   rate   of
12. 5∞C/min  and  hold  the  temperature  at  265∞C  for  16
min.
7. 1.3.4  Use n-Hexadecane, n-C
16
H

), as a standard
for  total  organic  analysis  4
.    Use  tris  (2-chloroethyl)

3
PO    (TCEP)    or    tributyl
phosphate,   (C

3
PO   (TBP),   as   a   standard   for
organophosphorus  analysis  (see  Section  6.1.1  ).    These
standards  are  introduced  into  the  GC  system  from  a
precleaned sample thermal desorption tube.  Two-point
calibration  method  is  recommended  for  checking  the
instrument  performance.    Recommended  standards  are
two  different  concentrations  of  n-C
16
H
34
(C
16
)  for  total
organic  analysis;  and,  two  different  concentrations  of
tris    (2-chloroethyl)    phosphate    (TCEP)    for    total
organophosphorus  analysis.    Recommended  frequency
of these measurements is at least once a week.
NOTE  4:    AED  and  FID  are  recommended  for  accurate  total
carbon quantification.
7. 1.4  Quantification
7. 1.4.1  Obtain  each  area below  for  the  calculation  of
total   organic   contaminants.      Obtain   total   organic
contaminants  of  the  sample  wafer  (A
s
)  by  summing  up
all  the  peak  areas  integrated  from  GC-AED,  FID,  or
MS  chromatogram  of  the  sample  wafer.    Obtain  total
area of the blank wafer (A
b
) by summing up all the peak
areas    integrated    from    GC-AED,    FID,    or    MS
chromatogram  of  the  blank  wafer.    Obtain  the  area  of
the  standard  peak  (A
c
)  integrated  from  GC-AED,  FID,
or MS chromatogram of the standard sample.
7. 1.4.2  Obtain  each  area below  for  the  calculation  of
total  organophosphorus  (TP).    Obtain  total  area  of
phosphorus  compounds  of  the  sample  wafer  (A
s
)  by</p><p>SEMI MF1982-1103 © SEMI 2003 5
summing  up  all  the  peak  areas  integrated  from  GC-
(phosphorus  selective  detector)  chromatogram  of  the
sample wafer.  Obtain total area of the blank wafer (A

)
by  summing  up  all  the  peak  areas  integrated  from  GC-
(phosphorus  selective  detector)  chromatogram  of  the
blank wafer.  Obtain the area of the standard peak (A
p
)
integrated   from   GC-(phosphorus   selective   detector)
chromatogram of the standard sample.
7. 1.4.3  Before starting analysis, weigh and get the total
weight  of  each  sample  wafer  to  be  tested,  and  also  the
weight of unused part of each wafer.  These weights are
used  for  the  calculation  of  total  organic  contaminants
and total organophosphorus (TP).
7. 2  Method B
7. 2.1  Sample Handling and Preparation
7. 2.1.1  At all times, avoid manual handling of samples
for analysis to prevent any secondary contamination of
samples.      Use   stainless   steel   tweezers   for   sample
preparation.    Use  a  propane  torch  to  flame  stainless
steel  tweezers  and  other  accessories  that  come  into
direct contact with the sample before their usage.
7. 2.1.2      Thermally   desorb   any   organics   from   blank
wafers  in  the  quartz  chamber  unit.    Recommended
conditions  for  preparing  blank  wafers  are  to  heat  them
for  30  min  in  the  quartz  chamber  kept  at  700∞C.
Usually, helium is used as purge gas.  Heating under air
or  oxygen  will  make  a  consistent  organic-free  SiO
2</p><p>surface.
7. 2.2  Wafer Desorption
7. 2.2.1    Enter  the  analytical  information  into  the  quarts
chamber unit, cold trap and GC.  Wait for the system to
be  stabilized.    Place  the  sample  wafer  into  the    quartz
chamber  unit  and  start  it.    Supply  helium  gas  into  the
quartz   chamber   and   heat   the   chamber   from   initial
temperature (40∞C or lower) to 400∞C at a rate of 10 to
30∞C/min, and hold the temperature for 15 min.  Sweep
out  the  volatiles  contained  in  the  sample  to  a  glass  TD
tube where they are adsorbed.
7. 2.2.2    Analyze  a  blank  wafer  at  least  daily.    Report
blank data with the sample data.
7. 2.3  GC Analysis
7. 2.3.1  Heat the glass TD tube and sweep out the target
organics adsorbed in the tube to a cold trap where they
are preconcentrated.  Two recommended conditions for
heating the glass TD tube are as follows:
• When   graphitized   carbon   is   used   as   adsorbent
material, heat the tube to 400∞C and hold at 400∞C
for 15 min.
• When   poly   (2,6-diphenyl-p-phenylene   oxide)   is
used  as  adsorbent  material,  heat  the  tube  to  270∞C
and hold for 15 min.
7. 2.3.2    Select  cold  trap  parameters,  that  is,  sorbent,
cold  temperature,  etc.,  such  that  all  target  analytes  are
quantitatively  retained  throughout  the  tube  desorption
process,  for  example  using  a  cold  trap  temperature  of
ñ130∞C.  Refer to ASTM Practice D 6196 for a method
for  testing  desorption  efficiency  and  analyte  recovery.
At  the  end  of  this  period,  heat  the  cold  trap  rapidly  to
300∞C  to  release  the  target  organics  to  the  GC  column
head.
7. 2.3.3    Separate  volatile  organics  desorbed  from  the
glass  TD  tube  by  an  appropriate  column  temperature
program.  Two recommended temperature programs are
as    follows.        For    high    resolution    analysis,    use
polydimethylsiloxane coated column (60 m by 0.25 mm
by 0.25-μm film thickness), heat the column from 40 to
280∞C at a rate of 10∞C/min and hold the temperature at
280∞C    for    16    min.        For    rapid    analysis,    use
polydimethylsiloxane coated column (25 m by 0.32 mm
by 0.52-μm film thickness), heat the column from 30 to
265∞C at a rate of 12.5∞C/min and hold the temperature
at 265∞C for 16 min.
7. 2.3.4  Use n-Hexadecane, n-C
16
H
34
(C
16
), as a standard
for  total  organic  analysis  (see  Note  4).    Use  tris  (2ñ

for   organophosphorus   analysis   (see   Section   6.1.1).
These  standards  are  introduced  into  the  GC  system
from  a  precleaned  wafer.    A  two-point  calibration
method  is  recommended  for  checking  the  instrument
performance.        Recommended    standards    are    two

of these measurements is at least once a week.
7. 2.4  Quantification
7. 2.4.1  Obtain  each  area below  for  the  calculation  of

GUIDE FOR MEASURING DIAMETER OF SILICON AND OTHER
SEMICONDUCTOR WAFERS
This   standard   was   technically   approved   by   the   Global   Silicon   Wafer   Committee   and   is   the   direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the   North   American   Regional   Standards   Committee   on   September   3,   2003.      Initially   available   at
<a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> October 2003; to be published November 2003.  Originally published by ASTM International
as ASTM F 2074-00.  Last previous edition ASTM F 2074-00.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1      The   diameter   of   semiconductor   wafers   is   an
important   parameter   in   microelectronic   fabrication.
Wafer diameters must conform to the limits specified in
SEMI  M1;  or  other  agreed  upon  limits,  or  product  that
is  otherwise  suitable  may  not  fit  correctly  in  process
equipment.</li><li>2      Cam-follower   edge   rounding   usually   results   in
wafers  that  are  circular.    However,  wafers  ground  with
edge-follower    edge    rounding    equipment    may    be
elliptically  shaped.    Measurements  made  at  the  three
positions   specified   in   this   guide   do   not   provide
complete information about the roundness of the wafer.
2  Scope</li><li>1      This   guide   defines   standardized   positions   for
measuring  diameter  of  circular  wafers  of  silicon  and
other  semiconducting  materials  that  contain  flats  or
notches  (fiducials)  on  the  periphery.    It  was  developed
for  use  with  silicon  wafers  with  standard  diameter  and
fiducial positions as given in SEMI M1.</li><li>2  It may be applied to other semiconductor wafers if
the flat locations are properly taken into account.</li><li>3    No  recommendations  are  given  regarding  the  test
instrumentation to be used, but either contacting (taking
suitable  precautions  to  avoid  edge  chipping)  or  non-
contacting  gauges  have  been  found  to  be  satisfactory.
Wafers  of  any  size  can  be  measured  provided  that
suitable test jigs and instruments are available.</li><li>4    Roundness  of  wafers  cannot  be  determined  from
measurements  made  solely  at  the  positions  defined  in
this  guide.    No  information  is  provided  concerning  the
diameter   of   the   wafer   at   points   other   than   those
measured.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1    The  presence  of  an  indent  or  uneven  edge  on  the
periphery of the wafer at the measurement position can
cause the resulting diameter measurement to be in error.</li><li>2    If  the  wafer  is  not  circular,  the  measured  diameter
may  differ  from  that  found  by  measuring  at  different
positions  or  based  on  a  different  number  of  measure-
ments.

5  Terminology</li><li>1  Definitions</li><li>1.1  diameter — of a semiconductor wafer,  the  linear
dimension  across  the  surface  of  a  circular  wafer  that
contains  the  wafer  center  and  excludes  flats  or  other
peripheral fiduciary geometries.</li><li>1.2  indent — of  a  semiconductor  wafer,  an  edge
defect  that  extends  from  the  front  surface  to  the  back
surface.
6  Measurement Positions</li><li>1  Measure the diameter at the three positions listed in
Table  1  for  the  appropriate  fiducial  position(s)  (see
Figure 1).  The angular positions in Table 1 are given in
degrees from the x-axis as defined in SEMI M20.</li><li>2    Calculate  the  diameter  of  the  wafer  as  the  average
of the diameters measured at the three positions.</li><li>3  The relationships between wafer configurations and
wafer  conductivity  types  and  orientations  as  defined  in
SEMI M1 are given in Table 2.</li></ol><p>SEMI MF2074-1103 © SEMI 2003 2

silicon  substrates  the  nitrogen  concentration  that  may
be  intentionally  introduced  to:  (1)  increase  the  V/G
tolerance  for  grown-in  defects  free  region,  where  V  is
the pull rate and G is the crystal temperature gradient at
the  solid-liquid  interface;

spectroscopy,  electron  paramagnetic  resonance,  deep
level   transient   spectroscopy,   and   charged   particle
activation analysis.

NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address the
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1    Nitrogen  on  or  in  the  surface  silicon  oxide  can
interfere with the bulk nitrogen measurement.
3. 2    Nitrogen  adsorbed  on  the  test  specimen  surface
from   the   SIMS   instrument   chamber   and   fixtures
interfere with the bulk nitrogen measurement by raising
the  background  signal.    The  vacuum  quality  of  the
SIMS instrument can be used to minimize this.
3. 3    Nitrogen  in  the  SIMS  primary  Cs  beam  may  be
implanted into the silicon specimen as CsN and thereby
increase  the  nitrogen  background  concentration.    A
primary  beam  mass  filter  may  be  used  to  reduce  this
interference, but in this case, a reduced Cs beam current
density is needed to maximize the sputter rate.
3. 4    Anomalous  nitrogen  intensity  spikes  can  interfere
with the averaging of signal intensity which is assumed
to be random (see Section 6.9).
3. 5    Carbon  introduces  an  interference  as
12
C
30
Si  at
mass 42 for detecting nitrogen as
14
N
28
Si.  This can be
avoided by detecting the nitrogen as
14
N
29
Si at mass 43,
but  the  signal  rate  is  reduced  greatly,  about  a  factor  of
20 when the minor isotope of silicon is used.  There are
methods   to   measure   the   carbon   interference,   and
subtract  this  interference.    One  of  the  methods  to
measure   the   carbon   interference   can   have   its   own
interference from high levels of boron dopant.
3. 6  The specimen surface must be flat in the specimen
holder  window  so  that  the  inclination  of  the  specimen
surface  with  respect  to  the  ion  collection  optics  is
constant  from  specimen  to  specimen.    Otherwise,  the
accuracy and precision can be degraded.
3. 7      The   bias   and   precision   of   the   measurement
significantly  degrade  as  the  roughness  of  the  specimen
surface  increases.    This  degradation  can  be  avoided  by
using chemical-mechanical polished wafers.
3. 8    Variability  of  nitrogen  in  the  calibration  specimen
can limit the measurement precision.
3. 9    Variability  from  the  calibration  measurement  may
increase    the    measurement    precision    of    the    test
specimen.
3. 10  Bias in the assigned nitrogen concentration of the
calibration  specimen  can  introduce  bias  into  the  SIMS
measured nitrogen.
3. 11    Thermal  processing  above  800°C  of  the  silicon
substrate  may  cause  diffusion  of  the  nitrogen,  so  that
the nitrogen concentration is not constant with depth, a
key assumption of this test method.
3. 12    Thermal  processing  of  the  silicon  substrates  in  a
nitrogen-containing    ambient    can    introduce    large
amounts  of  nitrogen  from  the  ambient  deep  into  the
silicon crystal.

6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1          SIMS     is     utilized     to     determine     the     bulk
concentration   of   nitrogen   in   single   crystal   silicon
substrate.    Specimens  of  single  crystal  silicon  (one
calibration specimen and the test specimens) are loaded
into a sample holder.  The holder with the specimens is
baked  at  100°C  in  air  for  1  h  and  then  transferred  into
the analysis chamber of the SIMS instrument.
6. 2    The  calibration  sample  is  analyzed  using  a  cesium
(Cs) primary ion beam and negative ion spectrometry of</p><p>14
N
28
Si, or
15
N
28
Si, depending upon the nitrogen isotope
in   the   calibration   sample,   to   determine   a   relative
sensitivity factor (RSF) of nitrogen in silicon.
6. 3      Each   test   specimen   in   the   sample   holder   is
sputtered  by  the  primary  cesium  ion  beam,  without
analyzing  secondary  ion  intensities,  in  order  to  reduce
the nitrogen background.  The amount of time required
for   this   pre-analysis   sputtering   depends   upon   the
instrumentation  and  the  desired  background  nitrogen
concentration.</p><p>9  Available from ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West

SIMS Signals in Nitrogen-Doped Silicon, Log Scale</p><ol start="6"><li><p>4    For  the  analysis  of  the  test  specimens,  a  cesium
primary   ion   beam   is   used   to   bombard   each   test
specimen at two different sputter rates, by reducing the
beam raster area for the second sputter rate, while at the
same  time  maintaining  a  constant  detected  area.    This
beam  raster  change  technique  is  used  for  two  reasons.
Firstly,  this  technique  reduces  the  background  nitrogen
contribution  from  the  sample  surface.    Secondly,  this
technique    allows    the    determination    of    both    the
instrumental  nitrogen  background  and  the  real  bulk
nitrogen     concentration     in     each     test     specimen

specimen, and due to averaging is capable of separating
the bulk nitrogen from the instrumental nitrogen even if
the   bulk   nitrogen   is   less   than   the   instrumental
nitrogen.

are   applied   in   each   measurement,   are   chosen   to
optimize the detection capability; the values depend on
the  instrumentation  being  used.    However,  the  second
sputter rate is typically the maximum sputter rate of the
instrumentation,  and  the  first  sputter  rate  is  typically
less than half that of the second sputter rate.</p></li><li><p>6    The  negative  secondary  ion  of

) is measured by a Faraday cup (FC)
or  appropriate  detector  during  the  profile.    If  multiple
detectors    are    used    during    the    test,    the    relative
sensitivities    of    the    detectors    are    determined    by
measuring   standard   ion   signals   (either   the   same

ding  upon  the  boron  and  carbon  concentration  in  the
test specimen.
6. 7  For illustration purposes an example data profile is
shown  in  Figure  1  where  the  log  of  counts  of
12
C
28
Si,
14
N,
28
Si,  and
30
Si  is  plotted  versus  sputter  time.    At
about 200 s, the Cs beam raster area was changed from
250 μm × 250 μm down to 50 μm × 50 μm, resulting in
an  increase  in  signal  intensities,  because  the  volume  of
material  analyzed  per  second  has  increased.    At  about
350 s, the Cs beam raster area was reversed back to the
first  condition,  and  the  signal  intensities  are  seen  to  be
reduced  back  to  the  original  levels.    Since  the  surface
analysis area was kept constant during the raster change
(that  is,  the  actual  surface  area  detected  is  independent
of  the  raster  area),  the  signal  intensities  have  two
separate   contributions,   one   from   elements   that   are
adsorbed  to  the  surface  and  one  from  elements  in  the
volume  of  material  analyzed  each  second.    There  is
some nitrogen (and carbon in this case) that is adsorbed
to the surface from the local environment outside of the
silicon, and there is some nitrogen that is from the bulk
silicon.  A key point is that if there is no nitrogen in the
bulk  silicon,  the  nitrogen  signal  intensity  does  not
change as a result of the change in sputter rate, because
the  adsorbed  nitrogen  (that  is,  instrumental  nitrogen
signal)  is  only  dependent  on  the  analysis  area,  which
has been held constant.  This understanding leads to the

In  these  equations,  the  secondary  ion  intensities  used
are averages of these signal intensities.  In the example
shown  in  Figure  1,  the  lower  sputter  rate  was  used  at
the beginning of the profile, and the higher sputter rate
in the middle of the profile.  For this example, <!-- -->[N]<!-- --> was
determined  to  be  8  ×  10

and  <!-- -->[N

.      The   use   of   averages   for   I
n
and   I

is
particularly critical for detecting low levels of nitrogen
where  the  signal  intensity  count  rates  can  be  low  and
therefore  noisy.    By  using  averages,  it  is  possible  to
detect an <!-- -->[N]<!-- --> level that is less than <!-- -->[N

6. 9    The  SIMS  measurement  of  nitrogen  in  bulk-doped
silicon  sometimes  reveals  anomalous  intensity  spikes
that  are  greater  than  a  random  fluctuation  of  signal
intensity,  even  in  silicon  that  has  not  been  thermally
processed  beyond  crystal  growth.
6,7
These  nitrogen
intensity   spikes   are   not   well   understood,   but   are
suspected   to   be   associated   with   oxygen   defects,
possibly  a  co-aggregation  of  nitrogen  and  oxygen  in  a
precipitate  form.    Similar  SIMS  effects  have  been  well
known   for   oxygen   and   even   carbon   in   thermally-
processed  silicon.

The   vertical   scale   is   linear.      The   unusually   high
nitrogen  signal  at  about  325  s  may  be  one  of  these
anomalous intensity spikes.  The presence of such non-

7  Apparatus
7. 1  SIMS   Instrument   —   Equipped   with   a   cesium
primary  ion  source,  electron  multiplier  detector,  and
Faraday  cup  detector,  capable  of  measuring  negative
secondary   ions.      The   SIMS   instrument   should   be
adequately prepared (that is, baked) so as to provide the
lowest   possible   instrumental   background,   since   the
instrumental   background   can   affect   the   detection
capability.    High  quality  vacuum  is  desired.    A  liquid
nitrogen-   or   liquid   helium-cooled   cryopanel,   which
surrounds   the   test   specimen   holder   in   the   analysis
chamber, may be helpful.
7. 2  Test Specimen Holder
7. 3  Oven — For baking the test specimen holder.
7. 4  Stylus  Profilometer  —  Or  equivalent  device  to
measure SIMS crater depths.  This device is required to
calibrate   depth   scale   for   concentration   profiles   of
calibration standard samples.
8  Reagents and Materials
8. 1    No  reagents  or  materials  are  required  for  this  test
method.
9  Safety Precautions
9. 1    The  preparation  of  silicon  test  specimens  from
silicon  substrates  requires  the  crystal  to  be  cleaved  or
broken.      This   procedure   may   generate   very   sharp
silicon  shards.    Care  must  be  taken  to  protect  the  body
and particularly the eyes from these shards.
10  Sampling, Test Specimens, and Test Units
10. 1  Since  this  procedure is  destructive  in  nature,  a
sampling   procedure   must   be   used   to   evaluate   the
characteristics of a group of silicon wafers.  No general
sampling  procedure  is  included  as  part  of  this  test
method,   because   the   most   suitable   sampling   plan
depends   upon   individual   conditions.      For   referee
purposes,  a  sampling  plan  shall  be  agreed  upon  before
conducting  the  test.    See  ASTM  Practice  E  122  for
suggested choices of sampling plans.
10. 2    The  calibration  or  reference  material  shall  be
silicon crystal with boron concentration below 2 × 10
17</p><p>atoms/cm

and  implanted  with  ions  of
14
N  or
15
N;  an
ion  implant  of  energy  200  keV  and  dose  of  about  1  ×
10

is preferred.
10. 3  Sample specimens must have a chemo-mechanical
polished surface on the side used for analysis.
11  Calibration and Standardization
11. 1  Calculate  the RSF  for  an  element  in  a  matrix
experimentally  from  the  SIMS  profile  of  a  reference
material   containing   a   known   areal   density   of   the
impurity of interest as follows:</p><p>)(nISId

cup (FC) to the electron multiplier (EM),
when two detectors are used.
11. 3    Complete  the  conversion  of  data  cycles  or  time
into  depth  by  measuring  the  crater  depth  and  the  total
time  (or  data  cycles)  of  the  sputtering  that  formed  the
crater.
NOTE 1:  The depth scale is assumed to be linear with time or
data cycles.
12  Procedure
12. 1      Cleave   or   break   specimens   from   the   silicon
substrates in order to fit within the SIMS sample holder.
Specimens  must  be  handled  under  normal  analytical
laboratory practices, but no special ambient is required.
12. 2  Load the specimens into the SIMS sample holder,
checking  to  see  that  the  specimens  are  flat  against  the
backs  of  the  windows  and  cover  the  windows  as  much
as   is   possible.      A   specimen   load   includes   one
calibration specimen, and one or more test specimens.
12. 3  Bake the loaded sample holder at 100 ± 10°C for
a minimum of 1 h in air.
12. 4    Turn  on  the  instrument  in  accordance  with  the
manufacturer&#x27;s instructions.</p><p>SEMI MF2139-1103 © SEMI 2003 6
12. 5    If  a  cryopanel  is  used,  fill  the  liquid  nitrogen  or
helium cold trap.
12. 6  For the calibration specimen use a cesium primary
ion  beam  and  detect  the  negative  ion  of
14
N
28
Si  or</p><p>15
N
28
Si,  depending  upon  the  nitrogen  isotope  used  in
the  ion  implantation;  detect  during  or  at  the  end  of  the
profile  a  matrix  negative  ion  (
28
Si,
29
Si,  or
30
Si).    After
the  entire  sample  load  is  analyzed,  measure  the  SIMS
crater depth in this sample using a profilometer.
12. 7  Position the specimen holder to sputter a crater in
a test specimen near the center of the window.  Without
detecting   secondary   ion   intensities,   begin   a   SIMS
profile.
12. 8  Repeat Section 12.7  for each test specimen.
12. 9    If  the  boron  level  in  the  test  specimen  is  below  1
× 10
17
/cm
3
, detect the negative ions of
12
C
28
Si,
14
N
28
Si,
and  a  matrix  signal  (
28
Si,
29
Si,
30
Si,  or
30
Si
2
).    If  the
boron  level  is  at  or  above  1  ×  10
17
/cm
3
,  include  the
detection of the negative ion of
11
B
28
Si.
12. 10  For the analysis of the test specimens, select two
raster conditions, one to maximize the sputter rate, and
one   that   provides   a   slower   sputter   rate.      Choose
apertures  or  other  means  to  maintain  the  analysis  area
under  raster  change  and  to  keep  the  negative  ion  count
rates  on  the  electron  multiplier  detector  below  1  ×  10
5</p><p>counts/s for the test specimen.
12. 11    Position  the  specimen  holder  to  sputter  a  new
crater near the crater created in Section 12.7 or Section
12. 8 .  Do not make the second crater in the same crater
created in Section 12.7 or Section 12.8 .
12. 12    Center  the  primary  ion  beam  and  begin  a  SIMS
profile  with  the  raster  area  that  produces  the  lower
sputter  rate.    Continue  the  profile  until  all  signals
provide relatively constant intensity for at least 20 data
points.
12. 13    Change  the  raster  area  to  maximize  the  signal
intensity.      Continue   the   profile   under   this   raster
condition for at least 20 data points.
12. 14  Reduce   the   raster   area   back   to   the   original
condition.
12. 15    If  the  boron  content  is  less  than  1  ×  10
17
/cm
3
,
subtract  0.0341  times  the  measured  mass  40  signal
(counts/s) from the measured mass 42 signal (counts/s)
to obtain the corrected mass 42 signal corresponding to
real nitrogen (
14
N
28
Si).
NOTE 2:  If mass 40 carbon (

(
12
C
30
Si +
13
C
29
Si) = 0.0335 + 0.0006 = 0.0341.
NOTE 3:  A hydride correction should be negligible for H on
the order of 10
19
atoms/cm
3
or less.
12. 16  If the boron concentration is at or greater than 1
×  10
17
/cm
3
,  subtract  0.0583  times  the  mass  39  signal
from  the  carbon  correction  to  correct  for  the  boron
interference.
NOTE 4:  The mass 39 boron (

Si) is defined =
1, and mass 40 (

12. 17    Calculate  the  bulk  nitrogen  concentration  <!-- -->[N]<!-- -->

each test specimen using Equations 5 and 6.
12. 18  Record the specimen identification.

specimens,
13. 4  The bulk nitrogen concentration values for the test
specimens,

tion during the faster sputter rate, and
13. 6  Whether anomalous nitrogen spikes were present,
and  if  so,  whether  the  averaging  included  or  excluded
these spikes.
14  Precision and Bias
14. 1    The  precision  of  the  nitrogen  determination  has
not  yet  been  determined  either  by  pilot  study  or  by
interlaboratory test.
14. 2      There   is   no   accepted   reference   material   for
determining  the  bias  for  the  procedure  in  this  test

PRACTICES FOR MONITORING NON-CONTACT DIELECTRIC
CHARACTERIZATION SYSTEMS THROUGH USE OF SPECIAL
REFERENCE WAFERS
This   standard   was   technically   approved   by   the   Global   Silicon   Wafer   Committee   and   is   the   direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the   North   American   Regional   Standards   Committee   on   October   16,   2003.      Initially   available   at
<a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> February 2004; to be published March 2004.  Originally published by ASTM International as
ASTM F 2166-02.  Last previous edition SEMI MF2166-02.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  Non-contact   dielectric   characterization   systems
(NCDCS)  that  supply  surface  charge  by  means  of  a
corona  instead  of  an  electrode  are  frequently  used  to
determine  the  oxide  characteristics  of  MOS  device
structures.  These instruments can measure a number of
characteristic parameters, including:</li><li>1.1  initial surface voltage (V
surf
or V
cpd
),</li><li>1.2  flatband voltage (V
fb
),</li><li>1.3  effective charge (Q
eff
),</li><li>1.4  density of interface traps (D
it
),</li><li>1.5  mobile charge (Q
m
), and</li><li>1.6  electrical dielectric thickness (T
ox
).</li><li>2      To   determine   that   the   NCDCS   is   performing
correctly, it is necessary to test the tester.  This practice
provides  procedures  for  testing  these  systems  with  the
use    of    special    reference    wafers    with    specified
characteristics.</li><li>3    The  procedures  in  these  practices  are  designed  to
ensure   that   the   NCDCS   being   evaluated   provides
reliable data for selected device-related parameters.</li><li>4    Flatband  voltage  is  an  important  parameter  in  the
fabrication  of  MOS  devices.    Its  value  is  dependent  on
the charge structure within and on the dielectric as well
as  at  the  silicon-dielectric  (Si-SiO
2
)  interface.    These
charges  consist  of  interface  and  bulk  trapped  and  fixed
charge,  mobile  charge  distributed  within  the  dielectric,
and   charge   residing   on   the   top   of   the   dielectric.
Although   the   total   charge   in   and   on   the   oxide
determines flatband voltage, the charge near the silicon
has the greatest effect.</li><li>4.1    Most  device  applications  require  that  the  mobile
charge   be   minimized   to   provide   stable   threshold
voltage.        Stability    of    the    charges    at    elevated
temperatures  is  a  measure  of  mobile  charge  density
within   the   dielectric.      The   mobile   charge   changes
location  under  temperature  and  electric  field  stress.
The  mobile  charge  density  can  be  calculated  from  the
resulting change in flatband voltage.</li><li>4.2      Equipment   used   to   produce   dielectrics   can
become  contaminated  in  various  ways.    When  such
equipment becomes contaminated, it usually introduces
an increased level of mobile ions into the dielectric.</li><li>4.3  Measuring V
surf
or V
cpd
,   the   contact   potential
between   the   probe   and   the   semiconductor,   with   a
Kelvin    or    Monroe    probe    allows    a    quantitative
measurement   of   the   charges   associated   with   the
semiconductor  surface  and  the  dielectric,  independent
of  top  (contact)  electrode  variations  as  in  MOS  C-V
measurements.      A   special   reference   wafer   has   the
mobile ions confined to the top half of the dielectric.  It
is  therefore  a  good  check  of  the  Kelvin  or  Monroe
probe, which is most sensitive to charges near the top of
the dielectric.</li><li>5    The  procedures  in  this  practice  can  be  used  to
ascertain  that  the  dielectric  characterization  system(s)
meet quality control requirements.  They can be used as
a training tool for tester applications.</li><li>6    The  results  obtained  by  these  measurements  can
also be used to expose and troubleshoot tester problems
including wafer handling and software issues.
2  Scope</li><li>1    These  practices  describe  the  use  of  wafers  with
special    electrical    and    physical    characteristics    for
controlling and monitoring performance of non-contact
dielectric    characterization    systems    (NCDCS)    that
employ  corona.    They  apply  in  general  to  dielectrics
with  charge  structure  that  can  be  measured  by  the
characterization    system.        Their    applicability    to
dielectrics  of  less  than  3-nm  electrical  oxide  thickness
depends  on  the  capability  of  the  NCDCS.    A  thickness
correlation  between  the  reference  wafer(s)  and  thin-
dielectric monitor wafers must be established.</li><li>1.1    The  reference  wafers  must  be  designed  to  check
the  repeatability  and  functionality  of  all  the  parts  and
subsystems  of  the  characterization  system.    Thermally
oxidized  wafers  are  not  sufficient  for  this  purpose
because  of  parametric  drift  due  to  temperature-bias
stressing and exposure to the atmosphere.</li></ol><p>SEMI MF2166-0304 © SEMI 2004 2
2. 2      Three   methods   are   described   to   cover   various
experimental  arrangements  (see  Related  Information  1
for a discussion on the two different types of corona).
2. 2.1  Method  A  ó  For  systems  that  employ  point
source corona,
2. 2.2  Method B ó For systems that employ line source
corona  and  can  be  programmed  to  obtain  a  full  set  of
parameters, and
2. 2.3  Method C ó For systems that employ line source
corona but can only determine mobile ion density.
2. 3  For each of the three methods, the total testing time
can     be     reduced     by     using     a     short-cycle-time
modification.
2. 4  Special  reference  wafers  are  used  to  determine
selected  performance  characteristics  of  these  dielectric
characterization    systems,    including    initial    surface
voltage  (V
surf
or  V
cpd
),  flatband  voltage  (V
fb
),  effective
charge  (Q
eff
),  density  of  interface  traps  (D
it
),  mobile
charge (Q
m
), and electrical dielectric thickness (T
ox
).
2. 5    The  parameters  determined  relate  to  the  properties
of the NCDCS subsystems in the following way:
2. 5.1  V
fb
and  Q
eff
data  are  used  to  check  the  surface
photovoltage   (SPV)   probe,   SPV   strobe   and   corona

3  Limitations
3. 1    The  presence  of  light  on  the  wafer  surface  during
the  measurements  can  affect  the  results  obtained  and
should    be    controlled    according    to    the    system
manufacturerís recommendations.
3. 2  Relative humidity in the measurement environment
above 60% may affect measurement values.
3. 3        Stray    electromagnetic    fields    external    to    the
NCDCS may affect measurement results and should be
limited    according    to    the    system    manufacturerís
recommendations.
3. 4  Wafer handling should be done in accordance with
accepted    clean    room    practices,    because    surface
contamination can affect the measurement results.
3. 5      Change   in   the   characteristics   of   the   special
reference wafers due to handling and other effects may
affect   measurement   results.      The   special   reference
wafers must be checked at least once every six months,
to assure consistent performance.

6  Summary of Practices
6. 1  Method A
6. 1.1      A   special   reference   wafer   is   loaded   into   the
NCDCS.
6. 1.2    A  series  of  tests,  which  must  include  CTS,  is
executed  to  position  mobile  ions  into  a  consistent  pre-
test  condition.    All  CTS  times  must  be  at  least  4
minutes to allow full movement of the mobile ions.
6. 1.3      Three   additional   identical   test   sequences   are
executed  to  collect  data  to  evaluate  performance  of  the
instrument.
NOTE  1:    The  bias,  temperature  and  time  used  for  the  last
CTS prior to carrying out the above tests should be employed
for these test sequences.
6. 1.4  Performance   of   the   NCDCS   and   its   selected
components  is  checked  by  measuring  the  following
characteristics:  initial  surface  voltage  (V
surf
),  flatband
voltage (V
fb
), effective charge (Q
eff
), density of interface
traps (D
it
), mobile charge (Q
m
), and electrical dielectric
thickness (T
ox
).
6. 1.5    Measurements  are  made  at  three  points  on  the
surface  of  the  wafer  and  the  mean,  standard  deviation
and relative standard deviation of the results obtained in
the   three   identical   sequences   (Section   6.1.3   )   are
computed and recorded.
6. 1.6      The   results   are   compared   with   the   values
supplied with the special reference wafer to evaluate the
NCDCS performance.
6. 1.7    If  it  is  desired  to  check  the  system  over  its  full
range of operation, this procedure is repeated using two
or   more   additional   special   reference   wafers   with
parameters  that  cover  the  typical  parameter  ranges  in
Section 7.4 .
6. 1.8  Short-cycle  Time  Modification  of  Method  A  ó
The  short-cycle  time  modification  is  performed  in  the
same  manner  except  that  the  measurement  of  Q
m
is
carried out first, in order to assure consistent alignment
of  the  mobile  ions  prior  to  the  other  measurements.
The Q
m
measurement  is  followed  by  the  measurement
of the other parameters.  No repetitions are required; the
test sequence in this modification is only run once.
6. 2  Method B
6. 2.1    First  any  remaining  residual  charge  on  a  special
reference  wafer  is  neutralized  by  immersing  it  in  DI
water.
6. 2.2    Then  the  special  reference  wafer  is  loaded  into
the  NSCDS  and  the  surface  voltage  (contact  potential
difference) is zeroed to within ± 0.3 V.
6. 2.3  Then the steps in Sections 6.1.2 ñ6.1.4 and 6.1.6
are followed.
6. 2.4    If  it  is  desired  to  check  the  system  over  its  full
range of operation, this procedure is repeated using two
or   more   additional   special   reference   wafers   with</p><p>SEMI MF2166-0304 © SEMI 2004 4
parameters  that  cover  the  typical  parameter  ranges  in
Section 7.4 .
6. 2.5  Short-cycle  Time  Modification  of  Method  B  ó
The  short-cycle  time  modification  is  performed  in  the
same  manner  except  that  the  measurement  of  Q
m
is
carried out first, in order to assure consistent alignment
of  the  mobile  ions  prior  to  the  other  measurements.
The Q
m
measurement  is  followed  by  the  measurement
of the other parameters.  No repetitions are required; the
test sequence in this modification is only run once.
6. 3  Method C
6. 3.1      The   steps   in   Sections   6.2.1   and   6.2.2   are
followed.
6. 3.2    Then  a  dummy  mobile  ion  run  is  performed  to
position   the   mobile   ions   into   a   consistent   pre-test
condition.
6. 3.3    Then  three  additional  mobile  ion  runs  are  made
and   the   average,   standard   deviation,   and   relative
standard   deviation   of   the   mobile   ion   density   are
determined.
6. 3.4    The  results  are  compared  with  the  mobile  ion
density data supplied with the special reference wafer to
evaluate the system performance.
6. 3.5    If  it  is  desired  to  check  the  system  over  its  full
range of operation, this procedure is repeated using two
or   more   additional   special   reference   wafers   with
parameters  that  cover  the  typical  parameter  ranges  in
Section 7.4 .
6. 3.6  Short-cycle  Time  Modification of  Method  C  ó
The  short-cycle  time  modification  is  performed  in  the
same  manner  except  that  the  first  CTS  time  is  4  min
and  the  second  is  8  min.    Only  a  single  mobile  ion  run
is carried out.
7  Special Reference Wafers
7. 1  Fabricate the special reference wafers (SRW) from
p-type silicon with a multi-layer dielectric including an
embedded  layer  of  mobile  ions  confined  to  the  top
portion of the dielectric.  These mobile ions drift during
temperature-bias  stressing.    Since  the  drift  occurs  only
in  the  top  of  the  dielectric,  the  Kelvin  (Monroe)  probe
easily  senses  a  shift  in  V
surf
(V
cpd
)  for  the  mobile  ion
concentration calculation.  Confining the mobile ions to
the top of the dielectric also ensures that measurements
associated  with  the  silicon-dielectric  interface  are  left
unchanged after the mobile ion test.
7. 2    Limit  the  thickness  of  the  dielectric  on  the  special
reference  wafers  to  between  30  and  70  nm,  to  provide
sufficient  distance  for  the  mobile  ions  to  drift  while
remaining clear of the interface.
7. 3    Ensure  the  dielectric  is  rugged  enough  so  that
repeated use, for example, once a day for six months, of
the  same  test  sites  does  not  result  in  shifts  in  electrical
parameters.
7. 3.1  Check parameter drift every 6 months.  Parameter
drift  over  time  should  be  less  than  10%  in  six  months.
If drift exceeds this value, replace the special reference
wafers.
7. 3.2          Test     wafers     must     be     re-calibrated     and
documented semi-annually by testing the wafers on two
documented  NCDCSs  that  have  been  maintained  using
this  Practice.    The  results  must  match  within  10%.    If
the   results   exceed   this   value,   replace   the   special
reference wafers.
7. 4  Test Parameter Ranges ó p-type special reference
wafers  should  have  parameters  appropriate  for  the  test
application.    Parameters  in  the  following  ranges  cover
all anticipated applications of the SRWs.
7. 4.1 V

7. 4.2 Q

7. 4.4 Dit = 0.5 to 50 × 10
11

ox = 30 to 200 nm.

system is evaluated.

range  of  operation,  select  a  set  of  at  least  three  special
reference  wafers  with  values  of  each  parameter  that
span the ranges given in Section 7.4 .

ions.  Repeat this procedure at two other locations.  An
example  would  be  the  locations  (0,0;  −40,40;  and  40,
−40),  where  the  x  and  y  locations  are  expressed  in
millimeters,   relative   to   the   wafer   center,   using   a

corona   sweeps   as   appropriate   to   erase   the   wafer
voltage.    Re-measure  and  record  the  voltage  on  the
wafer surface to verify it has been adjusted to zero.
NOTE  2:    To  determine  the  voltage  change  for  one  corona
sweep,  measure  the  voltage  on  the  wafer.    Then  sweep  the
wafer  with  one  positive  sweep.    Re-measure  the  voltage  on

RELATED INFORMATION 1
CORONA SUBSYSTEMS
NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI MF2166.  It was developed during the original
development of the document.  This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot on October
16, 2003.
R1-1.1  Two types of coronas are used in NCDCSs:
R1-1.2  Point   Source   Corona   ó   This   corona   type
applies   charge   at   discrete   locations   on   the   wafer
surface.    The  area  of  the  corona  is  defined  by  a  mask.
(See Figure R1-1.)
R1-1.3  Line Corona ó In this corona, a wire applies a
charge  uniformly  across  the  entire  wafer.    The  charge
level  is  applied  in  increments  that  cause  a  V
cpd
change
of between 0.3 and 0.6 V.  (See Figure R1-2.)</p><p>High

SPECIFICATION FOR BACK SURFACE BAR CODE MARKING OF
SILICON WAFERS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Traceability  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Traceability  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  October  25,  2002.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>
December 2002; to be published March 2003.  Originally published in 1993; previously published in 1995.
NOTICE:   The   userís   attention   is   called   to   the
possibility  that  compliance  with  this  specification  may
require  use  of  an  invention  covered  by  patent  rights.
By  publication  of  this  specification,  SEMI  takes  no
position  respecting  the  validity  of  any  patent  rights
asserted  in  connection  with  any  item  mentioned  in  this
specification.    Users  of  this  specification  are  expressly
advised  that  determination  of  any  such  patent  rights,
and  the  risk  of  the  infringement  of  such  rights,  are
entirely their own responsibility.
1  Scope</p><ol><li>1    This  specification  defines  the  content  and  location
of  a  back  surface  bar  code  marking  for  silicon  wafers.
The  code  is  variable  in  length  from  7  to  18  characters
which  are  user-definable.    A  character  position  is  held
constant  for  the  checksum  character,  but  all  else  is
variable.    No  other  information  is  encrypted  into  the
code.    This  allows  the  performance  requirements  of
related bar code reading equipment to be simplified.  In
addition,     provision     is     made     for     an     optional
alphanumeric  marking  of  the  size  specified  in  SEMI
M12  to  enable  operator  identification  of  wafers.    This
alphanumeric   code   is   not   intended   to   be   machine
readable.
NOTE  1:    The  example  as  described  in  Table  1  and  Figure  1
pertains   to   a   hard   mark   applied   by   the   silicon   wafer
manufacturer.</li><li>2    This  specification  applies  to  flatted  or  notched
silicon wafers of nominal diameter 125 mm and larger,
as specified in SEMI M1.</li><li>3    The  bar  code  can  be  read  bi-directionally  without
impairing its decodability.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

3  Terminology</li><li>1  Definitions</li><li>1.1  background  —  of  a  bar  code  symbol  ó  the
uniform  lighter  or  more  reflective  region,  including
quiet zones, that provides contrast for the darker bars.</li><li>1.2  bar — in a bar code symbol ó the darker or less
reflective element of  the symbol.</li><li>1.3  bar  code  density  ó  the  number  of  characters,
exclusive  of  quiet  zones,  that  can  be  represented  in  a
linear unit of measure.
NOTE 2:  Bar code density can be expressed in characters per
inch (cpi) or characters per millimeter (cpmm).</li><li>1.4  bar  code  symbol  ó  an  array  of  rectangular  bars
and spaces that are arranged in a predetermined pattern
following  specific  rules  to  represent  elements  of  data
that are referred to as characters.
NOTE 3:  The symbol is comprised of message characters and
start/stop  characters,  check  characters,  and  quiet  zones  as
required   by   a   particular   symbology   to   form   a   complete
scannable entity.</li><li>1.5  bar code character ó a single group of bars and
spaces  which  represent  an  individual  number,  letter,
punctuation mark, or other symbol.</li><li>1.6  bar  height  —  of  a  bar  code  symbol  ó  the  bar
dimension perpendicular to the bar width.</li><li>1.7  bar   width   —   of   a   bar   code   symbol   ó   the
perpendicular  distance  across  a  bar  between  the  points
on   opposite   edges   that   have   a   reflectance   that   is
midway between the background and bar reflectance.</li></ol></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-tags-row row margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/tags/semi">SEMI</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/tags/standard">Standard</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/your-org/semiconductor-docs/tree/main/docs/standards/semi/semi-chapter-152.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>编辑此页</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="文件选项卡"></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">文档</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/ic-design/intro">芯片设计</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/process/intro">工艺制造</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/eda-tools/intro">EDA工具</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/standards/intro">协议标准</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">社区</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/your-org/semiconductor-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/blog">技术博客</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">更多</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/blog">更新日志</a></li><li class="footer__item">
