SEMI G32-94 © SEMI 1986, 19941 SEMI G32-94GUIDELINE FOR UNENCAPSULATED THERMAL TEST CHIP 1 PrefaceThis guideline details recommendations for astandardized thermal test chip design for referee testpurposes. A sample data format for the test chip can befound in Appendix A. Based on the results of computersimulations of various chip-substrate configurations(Section 3.1), the following recommendations are madefor the design of thermal test chips for VLSI packagecharacterization (Section 3.2). 2 General Guideline2.1 Heat Sources  The heat sour ces (i.e., transistorsor resistor stripes), should use as much of the activechip area as possible so that the measured packagethermal resistance is indicative of the chip size beingused. A 10 mil (0.25 mm) parameter stripe (inactivearea) should be sufficient for bonding pads and scribelanes. It is desirable to use a range of test chip sizes sothat the package thermal resistance can be determinedas a function of chip size. A basic cell size of 75 mil(1.91 mm) square with a power dissipation capability of7.5 to 10 W is recommended. The heat source areashould exceed 85% of this basic cell active chip area.This basic cell could be arrayed or scaled up to a 450mil (11.43 mm) square chip in increments of 75 mil(1.91 mm) on a side. For larger chip sizes, the basic cellsize should be chosen so arrays can match the chip sizesin actual use. Since the larger chips can be 1520 mmper side, the basic cell may need to be 5 mm per side,so a 3  3 array can be 15 mm square minimum.2.2 Spacing between Heat Sources  The spacingbetween heat sources, which is needed to accommodatethe temperature-sensing elements (i.e., p-n junctions),should be minimized. The spacing should be less thanor equal to 2 mil (0.051 mm). The sensing elementshould be located at the center of the chip surface. Forchips that are built up from an array of standard cells,sensing elements are also needed near a corner andbetween two adjacent corners (i.e., near or in theinactive regions), of the basic cell. Additional sensingelements for such purposes as die attachment evaluationand non-uniform power dissipation studies may beincluded as appropriate. All sensing elements andassociated metallization runs must be electricallyisolated from the heat sources.2.3 Thermal Test Chip Thickness  The thermal testchip thickness should be between 18 mil (0.46 mm) and22 mil (0.56 mm). For thin packages, the test chipthickness should be reduced to the normal die thicknessfor that package. 2.4 Thermal Test Chip  The ther mal test chip shouldbe designed such that its power dissipation limitationsare consistent with the range of package thermalresistance encountered. This includes properly designedmetallization runs such that for arrayed test chips,heating current for inner chips is routed so that wireruns from the package to inner chips are minimized.The ability to cause a chip surface-to-case temperaturedifference of at least 20°C is desirable. To accomplishthis for silicon chips mounted on a variety of substrates(ranging from alumina to beryllia), the basic cellstructure (i.e., 75 mil (1.91 mm) on a side) shoulddissipate a minimum of 7.5 W.2.5 Bond Pads  Band pads (clea r opening) should beequal to or greater than 4 mil (0.10 mm) on a side.Sensing and heating elements should not be connectedto common bonding pads. Bonding pad location andsize can or should be configured such that for arrayedtest chips, chip-to-chip bonding is facilitated (i.e.,bonding wire runs from the package to inner chips areminimized), but this is not mandatory for acceptablefunctional operation.2.6 Temperature-Sensing Diode/D iode BridgeElements  The temperature-sensing diode/diodebridge elements should be usable over the completeoperating power and temperature range of the thermaltest chip. The thermal test chip should function atjunction temperature of 130°C minimum.2.7 Arrayed and Scaled Up Therm al Test Chips Pictorial representation of arrayed and scaled upthermal test chips are depicted in Figures 1 and 2,respectively. Heating elements (shaded areas) aretransistors or resistor stripes connected in a variety ofseries-parallel combinations on as well as off the chip.The heating elements should fill as much of the shadedarea as practical (consistent with the integrated circuitlayout design rules). 3 References3.1 Albers, J., Semiconductor Me asurementTechnology: TXYZ: A Program for Semiconductor ICThermal Analysis, NIST Spec.

For purposes of this test, the measured junction temperature is onlyindicative of the temperature in the immediate vicinityof the element used to sense the temperature.4.1.4 power dissipation (PH , in watts)  the heatingpower applied to the device causing a junction-to-reference point temperature difference.4.1.5 temperature-sensitive parameter (TSP)  thetemperature-dependent electrical characteristic of thejunction under test which can be calibrated with respectto temperature and subsequently used to detect thejunction temperature of interest.4.1.6 thermal resistance  junction to specifiedreference point, RJR degrees Celsius/watt. The thermalresistance of the microcircuit is the temperaturedifference from the junction to some reference point inthe ambient divided by the power dissipation PH .4.1.7 velocity (vA , in linear feet per minute (LFPM)) the velocity of the air at a specified location upstreamof the DUT. 5 Apparatus5.1 The apparatus required for these tests shall includethe following as applicable to the specified testprocedures.5.1.1 Thermocouple Material  Shall be copperconstantan (type T) or equivalent, for the temperaturerange 100 to + 300C. The wire size shall be no largerthan AWG size 30. The junction of the thermocoupleshall be welded to form a bead rather than soldered ortwisted. The accuracy of the thermocouple andassociated measuring system shall be ± 0.5C.5.1.2 Suitable Electrical Equipment  As required toprovide controlled levels of conditioning power and tomake the specified measurements. The instrument usedto electrically measure the temperature-sensitiveparameter shall be capable of resolving a voltagechange of 0.5 mV.5.1.3 Controlled Temperature Chamber, Fluid Bath, orWind Tunnel  Capable of maintaining the specificreference point temperature to within ± 0.5C of thereset (measured) value. Typical still-air enclosure and

SEMI G38-0996 © SEMI 1987, 2004 2 wind tunnel assemblies are presented for referencepurposes only.5.1.4 Still-Air Enclosure Assembly  The microcircuitshall be mounted in a cubic enclosure of not less than0.028 m3 (1.0 ft3). There shall be no radiation sourcesother than the microcircuit under test in the enclosure.The interior enclosure wall shall have a high reflectancefinish (emissivity &lt; 0.1). The ambient temperatureshould be measured by means of a thermocouplemounted at a distance of approximately 2.54 cm (1.0 in)beneath the DUT and 1.27 cm (0.5 in) from the testboard or socket.5.1.4.1 The microcircuit shall be mounted in such amanner that conduction cooling through the leads or thetest socket or both shall be small compared to the othercooling mechanisms. No. 36 AWG wire should beconnected to the device test socket. The air flow (bynatural convection) should be unrestricted above andbeneath the device. An alternative approach would beto use a mounting arrangement that approximates anapplication environment. Such a reference mountingconfiguration can be found in Specification, ThermalTest Board Standardization for Measuring Junction-to-Ambient Thermal Resistance of SemiconductorPackages. Device mounting and test board positioninginside the measuring chamber are depicted in Figure 1.5.1.5 Wind Tunnel Assembly  A typical wind tunneldesign is shown with its dimensions in Figure 2.5.1.5.1 The fan or blower should be placeddownstream of the DUT as depicted in Figure 2. Astatic pressure differential measurement across acalibrated nozzle is used to calculate the wind tunnel airvelocity, while a thermocouple is used to measure theambient temperature upstream of the DUT. Both ofthese devices should be placed at a specified locationupstream of the DUT, as shown in Figure 2. Thethermocouple is located in the center of the windtunnel, 5.08 cm (2.0 in) from the test section and 2.54cm (1.0 in) above the center plane of the DUT.5.1.5.2 The microcircuit shall be mounted in such amanner that conduction cooling through the leads or thetest socket, or both, shall be small compared to theother cooling mechanisms. To minimize conductionthrough the leads, No. 36 AWG wire should beconnected to the device test socket. The DUT should bealigned so that the air front is parallel to the longer edgeof the package (air front hitting the package side). Analternative approach would be to use a mountingarrangement that approximates an applicationenvironment. Such a referee mounting configurationcan be found in SEMI G42. Device mounting and testboard orientation inside the wind tunnel are depicted inFigure 3. 5.1.5.3 Flow straighteners should be placed upstreamof the DUT, as shown in Figure 2. The flowstraighteners should provide a flat velocity profileacross the test section of the wind tunnel. This willensure that the DUT is exposed to a uniform velocityacross its entire cross section. A typical velocity profilefor well-developed turbulent flow is depicted in Figure3.5.1.5.4 Calibrated hot wire anemometer or nozzle withsuitable pressure gauges (p 1 and p 2) for measuring thepressure difference across the nozzle is used tocalculate the wind tunnel air velocity. When using thenozzle, the pressure differential across the calibratednozzle is measured using a liquid monometer, typicallyin inches of water.5.1.5.5 Hot wire anemometer capable of verifying theair velocity profile with an accuracy of ± 5%. Thevelocity sensor should disrupt the airflow as little aspossible. 6 Procedure6.1 Measurement of Wind Tunnel Air Velocity, vA The air velocity measurement techniques are directmethod and indirect method.6.1.1 Direct Measurement of Wind Tunnel Air Velocity The direct method is based on a measurement by ahot wire anemometer in wind tunnel.6.1.2 Indirect Measurement of Wind Tunnel AirVelocity, vA  The air velocity measurement techniqueis an indirect method based on a pressure differentialmeasurement across a calibrated nozzle. The actualvelocity of interest is derived from a calibration curverelating the pressure differential of the nozzle to thevolume (or mass) flow rate of the air through thenozzle. The required air velocity (in linear feet perminute) is then calculated by dividing the volume flowrate (in cubic feet per minute) by the cross sectionalarea at the entrance of the DUT test section (in squarefeet). The volume flow rate shall be determined towithin an accuracy of ± 10%.6.1.2.1 Air Flow Profile  Hot wire anemometershould be used to verify that the flow profile of the airfront, measured within 5.08 cm (2.0 in.) of the testsection, does not vary by more than 10% across thecenter 90% of the test section. The DUT and mountingboard/socket should not be in the test section when theflow profile is determined.6.2 Direct Measurement of Reference PointTemperature, TS  For the purpose of measuring thestill-air junction-to-ambient microelectronic devicethermal resistance in a chamber, the ambienttemperature (T R = TA ) should be measured with a

SEMI G38-0996 © SEMI 1987, 20043 thermocouple beneath the DUT. For purposes ofmeasuring forced air junction-to-ambient thermalresistance in a wind tunnel, the ambient temperatureshould be measured with a thermocouple upstream ofthe DUT in the section of the tunnel that experiencesfully developed flow.6.3 Thermal Resistance, Junction to SpecifiedReference Point, RJR.6.3.1 General Considerations  The thermalresistance of a semiconductor device is a measure of theability of its carrier, or package and mounting techniqueto provide for heat removal from the semiconductorjunction. The thermal resistance of a microelectronicdevice can be calculated when the ambient temperatureand power dissipation in the device and a measurementof the junction temperature are known. When makingthe indicated measurements, the package shall beconsidered to have achieved thermal equilibrium whenhalving the time between the application of power andthe taking of the reading causes no error in the indicatedresults within the required accuracy of measurement.6.3.2 Indirect Measurement of Junction Temperaturefor the Determination of RJA  The purpose of the testis to measure the thermal resistance of integratedcircuits by using particular semiconductor elements onthe chip to indicate the device junction temperature. Inorder to obtain a realistic estimate of the operatingjunction temperature, the whole chip in the packageshould be powered in order to provide the properinternal temperature distribution. During measurementof the junction temperature, the chip heating power(constant voltage source) shall remain constant whilethe junction calibration current remains stable. It isassumed that the calibration current will not be affectedby the circuit operation during the application ofheating power.6.3.3 The temperature-sensitive device parameter isused as an indicator of an average (weighted) junctiontemperature of the semiconductor element forcalculations of thermal resistance. The measuredjunction temperature is indicative of the temperatureonly in the immediate vicinity of the element used tosense the temperature.6.3.4 The temperature-sensitive electrical parametersgenerally used to indirectly measure the junctiontemperature are the forward voltage of diodes and theemitter-base voltage of bipolar transistors. Otherappropriate temperature-sensitive parameters may beused for indirectly measuring junction temperature forfabrication technologies that do not lend themselves tosensing the active junction voltages. 6.3.4.1 Steady-State Technique for Measuring TJ The following symbols shall apply for the purpose ofthese measurements:I M Measuring current in milliamperes.VMH Value of temperature-sensitive parameters inmillivolts, measured at IM, and corresponding tothe temperature of the junction heated by PH.T MC Calibration temperature in degrees Celsius,measured at the reference point.VMC Value of temperature-sensitive parameter inmillivolts, measured at IM and specific value ofT MC . 6.3.4.2 The measurement of TJ, using junction forwardvoltage as the TSP, is made in the following manner:6.3.4.2.1 Step 1  Measurement of the temperaturecoefficient of the TSP (calibration).6.3.4.2.2 The coefficient of the temperature-sensitiveparameter is generated by measuring the TSP as afunction of the reference point temperature, for aspecified constant measuring current, I M, by externallyheating the device under test in a controlled temperatureoven or fluid bath. The reference point temperaturerange used during calibration shall encompass thetemperature range encountered in the power applicationtest (see Step 2). The measuring current is generallychosen such that the TSP decreases linearly withincreasing temperature over the range of interest andthat negligible internal heating occurs in the silicon andmetal traces. For determining the optimum TSPcalibration or measuring current, V MC vs. log I M curvesfor two temperature levels that encompass thecalibration temperature range of interest should beblotted. The optimum measuring current, I M, is thenselected such that it resides on the linear portion of thetwo V MC vs. log I M curves that were generated. Ameasuring current ranging from 0.05 to 5 mA isgenerally used, depending on the specifications andoperating conditions of the device under test formeasuring the TSP. The value of the TSP temperaturecoefficient, VMC/TMC, for the particular measuringcurrent used in the test, is calculated from thecalibration curve, V MC vs. TMC. At least three pointsshould be used to generate the voltage vs. temperaturecurve for the determination of the TSP temperaturecoefficient.6.3.4.3 Step 2  Power application test6.3.4.3.1 The power application test is performed intwo parts. For both portions of the test, the referencepoint temperature and the specified air velocity are heldconstant at a preset value. The first measurement to bemade is that of the temperature-sensitive parameter(i.e., V MC, under operating conditions with the

&lt;!-- Page 29 --&gt;

SEMI G38-0996 © SEMI 1987, 2004 4 measuring current, IM, used during the calibrationprocedure). The DUT shall then be operated withheating power (PH ) applied. The temperature-sensitiveparameter, VMH , shall be measured with constantmeasuring current, IM, that was applied during thecalibration procedure (see Step 1).6.3.4.3.2 The heating power, PH , shall be chosen suchthat the calculated junction-to-reference pointtemperature difference as measured at V MH is greaterthan or equal to 20C. In accomplishing this, the deviceunder test should not be operated at such a high heatingpower level that the on-chip temperature sensing andheating circuitry is no longer electrically isolated. Careshould also be taken not to exceed the design ratings ofthe package-interconnect system, as this may lead to anoverestimation of the power being dissipated in theactive area of the chip due to excessive power losses inthe package leads and wire bonds. The values of VMH ,V MC, and PH are recorded during the power applicationtest.6.3.4.3.3 The following data shall be recorded for thesetest conditions:a. Temperature-sensitive electrical parameters (V F,V EB, or other appropriate TSP).b. Junction temperature, T J, is calculated from theequation: TJ = TR + VMH  VMC( ) VMCTMC    1 where TR = TA c. Ambient (air) temperature, T A.d. Ambient (air) velocity, v A , (v A = 0 for still-airenclosure).e. Power dissipation, PH .f. Mounting arrangement (including offset from testboard). 6.4 Calculations of RJR6.4.1 Calculation of Package Thermal Resistance The thermal resistance of a microelectronic device canbe calculated when the junction temperature, TJ, hasbeen measured in accordance with procedures outlinedin Sections 6.1 through 6.3. With the data recordedfrom each test, the thermal resistance shall bedetermined from: RJR = TJ  TRPH(Package)where : RJR = RJA and TR = TA.
