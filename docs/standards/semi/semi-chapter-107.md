SEMI M49-0704 © SEMI 2001, 20041 SEMI M49-0704GUIDE FOR SPECIFYING GEOMETRY MEASUREMENT EQUIPMENTFOR SILICON WAFERS FOR THE 130 nm TO 65 nm TECHNOLOGYGENERATIONS This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the European Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the European Regional StandardsCommittee on May 14, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org June 2004; to be published July 2004.Originally published November 2001; previously published March 2003. 1 Purpose1.1 This document provides a guide for specifyingmeasurement equipment for geometry and flatness ofsilicon wafers of the 130, 90, and 65 nm technologygeneration as anticipated by the InternationalTechnology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) andin the forecasts of the major manufacturers ofsemiconductor devices. Wafer parameters as defined bySEMI M1, SEMI M8, SEMI M11, SEMI M24, orSEMI M38 are specified by customers of Si wafersuppliers and are usually part of Certificates ofCompliance. Suppliers of Si wafers and their customersmight measure these parameters using equipmentprovided by different manufacturers of such equipmentor using different generations of equipment of onesupplier. Agreement on basic features and capability ofsuch measurement equipment improves data exchangeand interpretation of data as well as procurement ofappropriate tools. 2 Scope2.1 This guide outlines and recommends basicspecifications for equipment for measuring geometryand flatness of Si wafers of 130, 90, and 65 nmtechnology generation.2.2 The guide applies to measurement equipment usedfor verifying the quality parameters geometry andflatness in large scale production of bare polished orepitaxial Si wafers the backside of which may be acidetched and/or covered by unpatterned, homogeneouslayers of e.g. poly-Si or LTO (low temperature oxide).Artifacts (e.g., reference materials) for calibratingmeasurement equipment might have differentproperties.2.3 The guide also applies to measurement equipmentthat provides only a subset of the measurement featuresoutlined in this guide.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 The document does not apply to measurementequipment used to control intermediate process stepsduring Si wafer manufacturing. However, it may becompletely or partly used for measurement equipmentfor those applications provided correspondingconstraints are appropriately identified.3.2 The document also does not apply to measurementequipment for SOI wafers or patterned wafers. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E5  SEMI Equipment CommunicationsStandard 2 Message Content (SECS-II)SEMI E10  Specification for Definition andMeasurement of Equipment Reliability, Availability,and Maintainability (RAM)SEMI E14  Measurement of Particle ContaminationContributed to the Product from the Process or SupportToolSEMI E30  Generic Model for Communications andControl of Manufacturing Equipment (GEM)SEMI E37  High Speed SECS Message Services(HSMS) Generic ServicesSEMI E58  Automated Reliability, Availability, andMaintainability Standard (ARAMS): Concepts,Behavior, and ServicesSEMI E89  Guide for Measurement SystemCapability AnalysisSEMI M1  Specification for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI M1.15  Standard for 300 mm PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon Wafers (Notched)SEMI M8  Specification for PolishedMonocrystalline Test Wafers

Sufficient measurements are needed to mitigatethe effects of variability. (SEMI E89)5.2.2 calibration  calibration is a measurementprocess that assigns value to the property of an artifactor to the response of an instrument relative to referencestandards or to a designated measurement process.NOTE 2: The purpose of calibration is to eliminate or reducebias in the users measurement system relative to thereference base. The calibration process compares an unknownor test item or instrument with reference standards accordingto a specific algorithm, often in the form of a specificcalibration curve. (SEMI E89)5.2.3 compatibility  the capability of measurementequipment to emulate the measurement process of othertools. Downward compatibility refers to formergeneration(s) of the same or similar type of equipmentof an equipment supplier.NOTE 3: Compatibility can be provided by a measurementmode in which filtering, spatial resolution, etc. of another,older, tool is imitated.5.2.4 correlation  the relation of measurementresults obtained by repeated measurements with thesame set of test specimen(s) and any two measurementtools expressed in terms of a regression curve.5.2.5 level 1 variability (1)  the variation (standarddeviation) of measurement results obtained by repeatedmeasurements with the same test specimen(s) and thesame measurement tool under nominally identicalconditions without replacing the test specimen betweensubsequent measurement runs.  tests are performedwith a single calibration in the shortest possible timeinterval.5.2.6 level 2 variability (2)  the variation (standarddeviation) of measurement results obtained by repeatedmeasurements with the same test specimen(s) and thesame measurement tool with replacing the testspecimen between subsequent measurement runs butotherwise under nominally identical conditions. 2  testsare performed with a single calibration in the shortestpossible time interval.5.2.7 level 3 variability (3)  the variation (standarddeviation) of measurement results obtained by repeatedmeasurements with the same test specimen(s) and thesame measurement tool with replacing the testspecimen between subsequent measurement runs butotherwise under nominally identical conditions. 3 testsare performed over a time period greater than 2 testswithout operator induced adjustment.5.2.8 matching tolerance (m)  the difference in biasfor any two measurement tools of the same kind.

SEMI M49-0704 © SEMI 2001, 2004 4 Otherwise matching tolerance tests are performed underthe conditions of 3 tests.NOTE 4: In the absence of certified or standard referencematerials matching may be tested by using appropriate waferscomplying with 130 nm technology node specifications. It isrecommended to test for matching with a set of samplescovering the parameter range of interest.5.2.9 precision over tolerance (P/T) ratio  the ratioof the precision of measurement equipment and aproducts tolerance. (SEMI M27)5.2.10 sorting  real and virtual separation of testspecimens in different categories specified by one ormultiple parameters.5.2.11 tolerance  the absolute magnitude of therange of the product specification. (SEMI M27) 6 Specification for Geometry MeasurementEquipment for Silicon Wafers6.1 The specification is structured in three sections(Tables 13): Generic Equipment Characteristics (Table 1) Materials to be measured (Table 2) Metrology Specific Equipment Characteristics(Table 3)6.2 Tables 13 contain the specifications, referenceddocuments, test methods, and comments. Additionalexplanations and discussions are provided in thissection.6.3 Generic Equipment Characteristics (Table 1)6.3.1 The section Generic Equipment Characteristicsconsists of five subsections: Wafer handling Reliability Procedural Documentation Computer/User Interface/Connectivity6.3.2 Subsections covering Facilities Requirementsand Safety/Legal/Regulatory are not included in thepresent document as these issues are highly userspecific and dependent on national regulations.6.4 Materials to be measured (Table 2)6.4.1 Table 2 specifies the parameters of Si wafers thatthe measurement equipment must be capable to handleand to measure. 6.5 Metrology Specific Equipment Characteristics(Table 3)6.5.1 This section specifies the dimensional parametersof Si wafers to be measured and to be reported byequipment for measuring the geometry and flatness ofwafers as well as the required spatial resolution,precision and accuracy of the measurement equipment.6.5.2 The ability of a metrology tool to properlymeasure surface features of different spatialwavelengths is affected by the spatial bandwidth of thetool's response function. Spatial bandwidth can bedefined in many ways and is influenced by manyfactors beyond the scope of this document. Some ofthese need to be standardized.6.5.3 Spatial resolution is defined by the high spatialfrequency limit of the bandwidth of the tool's responsefunction.6.5.4 Low and high cut-off frequency f min and f maxdefine the bandwidth of the response function ofmeasurement equipment. The cut-off frequenciescorrespond to an attenuation of 0.5 for the amplitude ofa sinusoidal surface feature with the exception of a lowpass filter (fmin = 0) for which the attenuation remains 1at fmin.6.5.5 The rate of change of the attenuation approachingthe cut-off frequencies has to be larger than the rate of aGaussian filter with the corresponding cut-offfrequency.6.5.6 The present document recommends fmax and f minthat must be measured by the instrument.6.5.7 Any variations in filtering procedures appliednear the FQA boundary must be described by thesupplier of the equipment.6.5.8 The bandwidth as specified in Table 3 is anominal value.6.5.9 In the present document a hierarchy of variabilitylevels is used to describe the performance ofmeasurement equipment which is calibrated andadjusted/aligned according to the supplier's procedures.The various terms are defined in section 5. Thesevariability levels are consistent with terms defined inSEMI E89 but not fully interchangeable. Their relationis indicated in parentheses.6.5.9.1 Level 1 variability: standard deviation 1(SEMI E89 static repeatability)6.5.9.2 Level 2 variability: standard deviation 2(SEMI E89 dynamic repeatability)6.5.9.3 Level 3 variability: standard deviation 3(SEMI E89 reproducibility)

SEMI M49-0704 © SEMI 2001, 20045 6.5.10 In addition two levels of systematic off-setbetween different tools are defined:6.5.10.1 matching tolerance (difference of means m)6.5.10.2 correlation (regression curve)6.5.11 Explicitly specified in the present document areonly level 3 variability 3 and matching tolerance m asthey correspond to the utilization of measurementequipment for wafer manufacturing most closely. Thesupplier of a specific tool may optionally providespecifications for level 1 and/or level 2 variability,respectively.6.5.12 Level 3 variability 3 and matching tolerance mare specified with respect to anticipated specificationsfor wafer geometry and flatness as given in Table 3 fora reference wafer.6.5.13 In the present document P/T-ratios are used forspecifying level 3 variability 3.6.5.13.1 A precision-to-tolerance ration P/T less than10% at 6 is recommended in SEMI M27 formetrology equipment. This would be an extremelydemanding specification for flatness and geometrymeasurement tools. In addition, flatness characterisiticsof Si wafers are typically described by a single sideddistribution with the median approaching zero, thelower specification boundary. Therefore two grades thatare based on 3 criteria, instead on 6, arerecommended for such tools in the present document: grade A: P/T &lt; 10%, 33 grade B: P/T &lt; 20%, 336.5.13.2 The individual measurement features a toolprovides may be graded differently, e.g. SFQR mightmeet grade A, but SBIR only grade B. This has to beindicated appropriately in the tools technicalspecifications.6.5.14 Matching tolerance is specified to be less orequal to 1.53 of level 3 variability. This corresponds toa greater than 99% probability that the difference of anyindividual measurement results obtained with twodifferent tools is smaller or equal to 53.6.5.15 The target for bias is a range of ± 1.53 withrespect to a certified value provided appropriatereference materials are available. This corresponds to agreater than 99% probability that any individualmeasurement is in the range of ± 43 around thecertified value when a reference material is tested. 6.5.16 Reference material with a series of surfacefeatures with appropriate height and half width isrequired to verify bandwidth of a measurement tool.The height of the features corresponds to the waferspecification as outlined in Table 3.6.5.17 The specifications of the measurementequipment are verified by using wafers the parametersof which are in a range, the upper limit of whichcorresponds to 1.5 times anticipated waferspecification, the lower limit to 0.5 of anticipated waferspecification. These are listed in Table 3 as ReferenceWafer Specifications.NOTE 5: The edge region of wafers represents the mostchallenging area for meeting the desired performancecharacteristics. This is because of the larger surface geometryvariations in the region near the edge, e.g. from polishing roll-off.6.5.18 Reference Wafers  The specifications of themeasurement equipment are verified by using referencewafers with properties covering the range given inSection 1 of Table 3. All reference wafers shall meetthe thickness and warp requirements listed in the tablebut different wafers may be used to meet the flatnessand nanotopography requirements. For site relatedspecifications not all sites must fall within the range,but the appropriate sites to be tested should beindicated. In all cases, at least three wafers in the rangeof values for each property shall be employed in thetesting.6.5.19 Verification of bias, matching tolerance and thevarious levels of variability are performed withequipment which is calibrated according to thesupplier's procedures and which is under statisticalprocess control.6.5.20 Compatibility of two tools is considered to besatisfactory when the specifications of the older tool aremet with the newer tool operating in the emulationmode.6.5.21 The quality of a correlation between differentmeasurement equipment is not specified in the presentdocument. 7 Related Documents7.1 ASTM DocumentsE 177  Standard Practice for Use of the TermsPrecision and Bias in ASTM Test MethodsE 456  Standard Terminology for Relating to Qualityand Statistics

SEMI M50-1104 © SEMI 2001, 2004 2 5.1.4 false count (FC)  laser-light scattering eventthat arises from instrumental causes rather than fromany feature on or near the wafer surface; also calledfalse positive.5.1.4.1 Discussion  False counts would not beexpected to occur at the same point on the wafer surfaceduring multiple inspection scans, and hence they couldbe considered as random noise that could be identi-fied by examining the results of repeated scans.5.1.5 false count rate (FCR)  mean total number offalse counts per wafer that an SSIS reports at somespecified SSIS operational setting.5.1.6 repeat counts  LLSs that are found in a laterscan within the scanner XY uncertainty distance of theirlocation as found on an earlier scan.5.1.6.1 Discussion  The implication is that if defectdensity is low enough, then a repeat count results fromdetecting the same LLS event again and is not the resultof SSIS noise. Besides the absolute position of theLLS, an additional matching condition may be the LSEsignal of the LLS.5.1.7 scanner XY uncertainty  square root of thesum of the squares of the one-sigma standard deviationsin the reported X and Y locations of the SSIS under test,as determined under repeatability conditions.5.1.8 true count  laser-light scattering event thatarises from the localized light scatterers (LLS) beinginvestigated. 6 Summary of Method6.1 The XY coordinate uncertainty of the SSIS undertest is either known or determined under repeatabilityconditions, without removing the wafer from the stagebetween scans.6.2 The reference wafer to be used in this test isselected.6.3 The selected wafer is scanned Z times on the SSISunder test. The first two scans are used to qualify thereference wafer before continuing with the remainingZ2 scans.NOTE 2: Typical values for Z are between 30 and 100 scans.6.4 The scans are analyzed to determine and record thenumber of times each LLS event occurs in eachlocation (to within a distance approximately six timesthe scanner XY uncertainty) during the Z scans. Thecapture rate, standard size deviation, false count rate,and cumulative false count rate are determined fromthis data set. 7 Apparatus7.1 SSIS under test  installed in its position of usewith clean room rating recommended by themanufacturer.7.2 Off-line analysis software program  to track eachobserved count and determine the capture rate, standardsize deviation, the number of false counts at each LLSsize, the false count rate, and the cumulative false countrate.NOTE 3: The analysis software may be incorporated into theSSIS, if desired. 8 Test Specimens8.1 Use any wafer with (1) natural LLS with density&lt;10 LLS/cm2 and (2) a surface roughness typical of thewafers to be measured in production (see Section 2.3).8.1.1 The minimum distance between any two LLSfound during any one scan and used in the data set to beanalyzed shall be larger than six times the scanner XYuncertainty. Clusters of LLS (found in any one scanand closer together than six times the scanner XYuncertainty) and scratches must be excluded during theanalysis.8.1.2 Determine the scanner XY uncertainty fromprevious knowledge, from the scanner manufacturerspecifications, or from the positional accuracydetermined under repeatability conditions in accordancewith Appendix 1.8.2 Alternatively, a wafer with deposited polystyrenelatex spheres can be used to evaluate the capture ratemore accurately at a specific particle size. The sameparticle density, particle spacing, and defect clusterconditions as in Section 8.1 should be observed.NOTE 4: The wafer with deposited PSL spheres may or maynot be certified reference material. 9 Procedure9.1 Qualify the wafer for appropriate LLS number (seeSection 8.1) prior to taking CR and CFCR data asfollows:9.1.1 Scan the wafer once and determine position, Pm,and size, S m, of each of the M1 detected LLS events withm = \[1, 2,  M1\].9.1.2 To determine that there are enough repeatingLLS events to make the CR calculation meaningful,scan the wafer a second time and compare the detectedLLS events with respect to the positions of thosedetected during the first scan. Define the total numberof LLS events that repeat their position in the first scanto within six times the scanner XY uncertainty as M2.Consider the wafer qualified for the test if the share of

&lt;!-- Page 17 --&gt;

SEMI M50-1104 © SEMI 2001, 20043 repeat LLS events on the wafer, M2, is larger than 0.75M1. Make certain that the conditions of Sections 8.1and 8.1.1 are fulfilled for both wafer scans.9.2 Scan the wafer a total of Z times to obtain CR,FCR, and CFCR data (see NOTES 3 and 6). Recordeach LLS event detected during the Z scans accordingto its position P and size S.NOTE 5: The two scans obtained in Sections 9.1 through9.1.2 can be used as part of this data set, but the wafer mustremain on the scan stage during the entire set of Z scans toperform the measurement sequence under repeatabilityconditions. 10 Analysis10.1 Initial Analysis10.1.1 Determine the locations on the wafer where anLLS event has been detected at least once by comparingall recorded positions (within the constraint of the six-sigma XY uncertainty) of the multiple scans as reportedby the SSIS. These locations, Li, with i = \[1, 2, ,N\]represent the complete set of LLS events to be used inthe analysis. Each location is characterized by thenumber of scans H i, in which the LLS event at thatposition has been detected, and by the H i reported sizesS ih, where h = \[1, 2, ,H i\], for the LLS event.10.1.2 Consider those of the N events with H i = 1, (i.e.,events seen only once) as false counts. Order theseevents by decreasing size, S i. Index them by f = \[1, 2,...,F\], with f = 1 representing the largest size and f = Frepresenting the smallest.10.1.3 Consider those events that were seen at leasttwice during the Z scans (H i ≥ 2) to be true counts.NOTE 6: The sequence of analysis steps given below isintended to be representative and illustrative. The actualalgorithms used in the analysis software may differ from theseas long as the same result is achieved.10.2 Analysis of True Counts10.2.1 Determine the average size of each truecount (H i ≥ 2) as follows: ==&gt;), for every true count as follows: ZHSCR ii =&gt;&lt; )( (2) 10.2.3 Plot CR() versus as in the example inFigure 1, and interpolate or fit the data to discriminateagainst outlying points. NOTE 7: The following equation for c s, in percent,  =00exp1100 cssc s , (2a) may be used to fit the plotted CR() data. Here, c s is thefitted value of CR(), s is the size (), s0 is the size atzero probability of capture, and c0 is a curvature factor thatdetermines the point at which the probability of captureapproaches 100%. As c0 and s0 constitute a sufficientparameter set to describe completely CR(), they can beused for reporting, together with the chi-square goodness ofthe fit test statistic result.NOTE 8: Note that there are a few points below the principalcurve in Figure 1. These points may have arisen from addedparticles that appeared on the wafer during the test. Theyshould be neglected in fitting any curve to the capture ratedata.10.2.4 Calculate the standard deviation of size S i for alltrue counts as follows: =&gt;&lt;=iH hiihii SSHS12)(11)( (3) 10.2.5 Plot the standard deviation of size, (S i), versusthe mean size, , for all true counts as shown in theexample in Figure 2.NOTE 9: Again, note the same outliers in Figure 2.

SEMI M50-1104 © SEMI 2001, 2004 6 APPENDIX 1DEFAULT PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINATION OF SCANNER XYUNCERTAINTY NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI M50 and was approved by full letter ballotprocedures on April 22, 2004 by the North American Regional Standards Committee. A1-1 PurposeA1-1.1 This procedure is intended to be used for determining the scanner XY uncertainty for the scanning surfaceinspection system (SSIS) under test when this information is not otherwise available. A1-2 ScopeA1-2.1 This appendix covers a procedure for determining ability of an SSIS to report the location of a localizedlight scatterer (LLS) on a silicon wafer surface under repeatability conditions.NOTICE: This appendix does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this procedure to establish appropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. A1-3 LimitationsA1-3.1 If particles are used as the reference LLSs, care must be taken both to avoid contamination by interferingparticles and to avoid removal of the reference particles.

SEMI M51-0303 © SEMI 2002, 20031 SEMI M51-0303TEST METHOD FOR CHARACTERIZING SILICON WAFERS BY GATEOXIDE INTEGRITY This test method was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the Japanese Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the Japanese RegionalStandards Committee on January 10, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org January 2003; to bepublished March 2003. Originally published July 2002. NOTICE: This document was rewritten in its entiretyin 2002. 1 Purpose1.1 This test method describes procedures forcharacterizing silicon wafers to determine Gate OxideIntegrity (GOI). This test method is effective inevaluating the density of Crystal Originated Particles(COP) in polished Czochralski (CZ) silicon wafers thatinfluence GOI. 2 Scope2.1 This test method provides detailed procedures forcharacterizing silicon wafers using GOI. This testmethod describes standard procedures for Metal OxideSemiconductor (MOS) fabrication, electricalmeasurement, analysis, and reporting.2.2 Thermally grown gate oxide films with gate oxidethicknesses ranging from 2025 nm and polysiliconelectrodes are used as MOS capacitors. Discussion ofthe gate oxide thickness is given in a later section.2.3 Time Zero Dielectric Breakdown (TZDB) is usedas the electrical characterization method of MOScapacitors.2.4 It is well known that oxygen precipitates are also asource of gate oxide defects.1 However, this is beyondthe scope of this standard because the as-receivedwafers contain only a small amount of oxygenprecipitate.NOTE 1: The polysilicon film can make standard test resultsapplicable to the testing of wafers used to fabricate integratedcircuits rather than other metal electrodes because polysiliconelectrodes are commonly used in actual devices.NOTE 2: The TZDB method measures oxide breakdownelectric fields using MOS capacitors. The density of COPscan be estimated from a histogram of the breakdown electricfield.NOTE 3: For a detailed discussion of sample structures forthis test method, the reader is referred to EIA/JEDECStandard 35-1. In general, the three most likely sample 1 K.Yamabe and K.Taniguchi, Time-Dependent DielectricBreakdown of Thin Thermally Grown SiO2 Films, J. Solid St.Circuits, SC-20, 343 (1983). structures are simple planar MOS capacitors, MOS capacitorswith various isolation structures (for example, local oxidationof silicon (LOCOS), shallow trench isolation (STI)), and fieldeffect transistors (FET). For the purpose of silicon wafercharacterization, the simple planar MOS capacitor structure ispreferable. This is because with the various isolationstructures and FET, silicon wafers sometimes receive thermaltreatments during the complicated sample fabrication process.Therefore, it is questionable to look upon a measurement ofone of the latter two wafers as the starting silicon wafercharacterization.NOTE 4: This standard is based on round robin resultsamong silicon wafer manufacturers. In general, the COPs inthe polished CZ silicon substrates strongly influence theTZDB histogram of the gate oxide. This GOI test methodstrongly depends on wafer-surface/near-surface crystaldefects, contaminations, particles and cleanliness of the MOSfabrication processes environment. Cleanliness of theprocesses environment should be evaluated because itstrongly affects the MOS characteristics. (See Section 5.2.1and Related Information 1).NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI C3.6  Standard for Phosphine in Cylinders99.98% Quality (Provisional)SEMI C3.21  Standard for Carbon Tetrafluoride inCylinders (Provisional)SEMI C3.22  Standard for Oxygen, 99.5% QualitySEMI C3.23  Standard for Oxygen, 99.98% QualitySEMI C3.28  Standard for Nitrogen, VLSI Grade inCylinders, 99.9996% QualitySEMI C3.41  Standard for Oxygen, Bulk, 99.9998%Quality (Provisional)SEMI C3.49  Standard for Bulk Nitrogen,99.99999% Quality (Provisional)SEMI C3.54  Gas Purity Guideline for Silane

SEMI M51-0303 © SEMI 2002, 20033 This failure mode is caused by pinholes of the oxide filmsformed in the gate oxide process. COPs do not cause theseoxide pinholes. B mode failure: Accidental breakdownCOPs are a main origin of this failure. This failure modeinfluences reliability of MOS devices and MOS integratedcircuits. C mode failure: Fatigue breakdownThis failure mode is partly caused by COPs, but is almost awearout breakdown. These categories have traditionally beenused for oxide thicknesses of about 2025 nm. For thinnerfilms, care must be taken in their use and in proper derivationof the oxide field strength as described in Related Information1.4.2.3.3 time zero dielectric breakdown (TZDB)  thisis one of the electrical characteristics of dielectric films.This characteristic is contrasted with time dependentdielectric breakdown.11, 12 4.2.3.3.1 Discussion  An applied bias, for which theoxide leakage current goes over a predetermined value,I bd , is measured as a breakdown gate voltage. Thebreakdown electric field is defined by the gatebreakdown voltage normalized by the gate oxidethickness. 5 Summary of Method5.1 Overview  This test method involves fabricatingan array of many similar MOS capacitors on siliconwafers, measuring the TZDB voltage histogram byapplying step voltage to the MOS capacitors whilemonitoring the oxide leakage current, and estimatingthe dielectric breakdown defect density caused by thesilicon wafers. The defect is estimated from the B-mode failure fraction. This test is for characterizingsilicon wafers and is very useful in evaluating thecrystal defects (mainly COPs) of mirror-polished CZsilicon wafers.5.2 MOS Capacitor Fabrication Process  ManyMOS capacitors are formed on the test wafer. TheMOS capacitor fabrication process consists of wafercleaning, thermal oxidation, polysilicon deposition,phosphorous doping, activation heat treatment,photolithography and polysilicon etching.5.2.1 Fabrication Environment  It is necessary tofabricate MOS capacitors in a clean room environmentof 1000 class or better in total quality. That is, it needs 11 D. L. Crook, Method of Determining Reliability Screens forTime Dependent Dielectric Breakdown, Proc. Int. Reliability PhysicsSymposium, 1979, p.112 E. S. Anolick and G. R. Nelson, Low Field Time DependentDielectric Integrity, Proc. Int. Reliability Physics Symposium, 1978,p.8 to be confirmed that the A-mode failure rate is 10% orless. The A-mode failure depends not only on theparticle density in the work environment atmospherebut also on ultra pure water, fixtures, process apparatus,clean cloths, operation rules, etc. Heavy contaminationby alkaline metals, heavy metals and so on has animportant effect on the TZDB of the oxide.5.2.2 Wafer Cleaning  To characterize the as-received silicon wafers, the wafers shall not be cleaned.If they might contaminate a furnace, the wafers shall becleaned before oxidation. In these cases, the wafers aregenerally cleaned by a modified RCA method6. Thecleaning method shall be confirmed in advance so thatthe previously mentioned condition for the A-modefailure is met.5.2.3 Thermal Oxidation  The gate oxide of theMOS capacitor is thermally grown. It is desirable to fixthe oxidation conditions. Because the oxidationtemperature influences the rate of oxidation, 13 whichinfluences the oxide film thickness and thus the gateoxide quality, it is recommended that the gate oxide of20-25 nm is grown in dry oxygen ambient at 850950C. The addition of HCl or water vapor to theoxidation ambient can cause underestimation of theoxide defect density. As a result, one evaluation resultof a gate oxide formed under a special oxidationcondition cannot be compared with another obtainedunder standard oxidation condition. To measure oxidefilm thickness, a monitor wafer is oxidized togetherwith the sample wafers. An average value of 5 or morepoints on the monitor wafer is adopted as the oxidethickness.5.2.4 Electrode Formation  A polysilicon layer witha thickness of 200400 nm and a sheet resistance of 20-50 Ω/sq is formed by low-pressure chemical vapordeposition (LP-CVD). There are generally in-situ andex-situ phosphorous doping methods.5.2.5 Ex-situ Phosphorous Doping  After theundoped polysilicon film is formed by the LP-CVDmethod, phosphorous is diffused using POCl3 asphosphorous source.5.2.6 In-situ Phosphorous Doping  Thephosphorous-doped polysilicon is deposited using anin-situ doping LP-CVD, followed by a heat treatment toactivate the doped phosphorus.NOTE 7: If the resistance of the polysilicon electrode films istoo high, the voltage drop that results within the electrodecannot be neglected. In this case, the oxide leakage current isdecreased in the range of the higher electric field. On theother hand, if the phosphorus doping is too high and the 13 B.E.Deal and A.S.Grove, General relationship for the thermalOxidation of Silicon, J.Appl.Phys., 36, 3770 (1965).

SEMI M51-0303 © SEMI 2002, 2003 4 resisitivity is too low, the gate oxide dielectric characteristicsdegrade. Too thin a polysilicon electrode makes self-healingof oxide weak spots easier. This self-healing causes the oxidebreakdown defect density to be underestimated. Too thinpolysilicon electrode also causes the TZDB measurement tobe degraded by mechanical stress resulting from an exploringprobe such as a tungsten probe. With too thick of apolysilicon electrode in the ex-situ doping technique, it is easyto induce a depletion layer of phosphorus near thepolysilicon/SiO2 interface that causes parasitic resistance andunnecessary voltage drop in the measurement circuit. It isdesirable to monitor the thickness and sheet resistance of thepolysilicon layers in every processing batch using a monitorwafer.5.2.7 Photolithography Process  The MOScapacitors electrodes are formed by patterning in thephotolithography. EIA/JEDEC Standards 35, 35-1, 35-2are referred to regarding this mask design. Theappropriate area and the appropriate number of MOScapacitors for each defect density shall be selected inorder to detect crystal defects. For the evaluation ofCOPs, it is necessary to measure 100 or more MOScapacitors with a gate area of about 10 mm 2 on a wafer.(See Table R1-3 in Related Information 1.) For spares,it is desirable to prepare the plural MOS capacitors withthe same gate area within each chip.5.2.8 Etching Processes  The photo resist patternformed by the photolithograph technique is used as amask for polysilicon etching. Generally, either a wetetching method or a dry etching method is applied topolysilicon etching. If a wet etching method is applied,the etching rate shall be well controlled. If theperipheral oxide of the electrode is removed, it issometimes difficult to accurately measure the TZDB. Ifa dry etching method is applied, especially RIE, careshall be taken with the charging-up of the MOScapacitors. In cases where the A-mode defect density ishigh, the MOS capacitors shall be confirmed not to becharged up during the etching process. If an ashingremoval is carried out with the photo resist, care shallbe taken with the charging-up of the MOS capacitors.As with RIE, in cases where the A-mode defect densityis high, the MOS capacitors shall be confirmed not tobe charged up during the ashing removal process. Ifthere are oxide and polysilicon film on the backside ofthe wafer, those shall be removed.5.3 Measurement of the Electrical Characteristics ofMOS Capacitors5.3.1 The dielectric breakdown defect density ofsilicon oxide is evaluated by the TZDB method forMOS capacitors. In the TZDB method, the gate oxideelectric field of an MOS capacitor is continuouslyincreased in stepwise fashion. The electric field appliedto the gate oxide when the gate oxide leakage currentexceeds the predetermined dielectric breakdown judgment value is defined as the oxide dielectricbreakdown field. From a histogram of the breakdownfields for 100 or more MOS capacitors, the dielectricbreakdown defect density is estimated.5.3.2 We can see two characteristics of the formedMOS capacitors from the current-voltage (IV) plots.Firstly, deviation of the gate oxide thickness appears ina loose distribution of the I-V plots. Secondly, if the I-V curves bend suddenly and have gentle slope in thehigh voltage region, there may be high parasiticresistance, for example, high resistance in thepolysilicon electrode. In such a case, the reliablemeasurement demands the adjustment of the MOSpreparation process.5.3.3 Applied Step VoltageNOTE 8: For a reliable measurement, a voltage source witha well-defined output shape shall be used. An overshootingof the applied step voltage decreases the apparent oxidebreakdown voltage as compared with a real breakdownvoltage. In the TZDB measurement, the constant voltage isheld after a predetermined period and the oxide leakagecurrent is measured. Next, the applied voltage increasesstepwise. This procedure is repeated. If the holding time isshorter than 100 ms, the voltage may not be stable enough toallow the current to be measured. 800 ms may be enough toachieve a stable voltage. Especially, in the high electric fieldregion, the gate oxide may receive electric stress similar totime dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB). A holdingtime of 200 ms is recommended. Accordingly to the roundrobin result as described in Related Information 1, there areno problems in setting the holding time to 100800 ms. Therecommended step height of the applied voltage is between0.10.5 MV/cm in electric field. The polarity of the voltage isselected for the Si surface so as to be in accumulation. Thatis, for p-type silicon wafers, the gate electrodes are negativelybiased. The maximum electric field is 15 MV/cm. Even if agate voltage corresponding to more than 15 MV/cm isapplied, the voltage is not effectively applied to the gate oxidebecause of a voltage drop due to parasitic resistance. In thecase of n-type silicon wafers, the applied electrodes shall bepositively biased.5.3.4 Breakdown Judgment5.3.4.1 The oxide dielectric breakdown is judged bythe predetermined oxide leakage current. That is, whenthe gate oxide leakage current exceeds the dielectricbreakdown judgment current, the applied voltage isdefined as the breakdown voltage. The breakdownelectric field is the value that the breakdown voltage isnormalized by the gate oxide thickness.5.3.4.1.1 Discussion  If the dielectric breakdownjudgment current is too high (Ig &gt; 10 3 A), some of theproper A-mode failures can be counted as B-modefailures because of the series resistance of the samplesor measurement system. Otherwise, if the dielectricbreakdown judgment current is too low (Ig &lt; 10 7 A),

&lt;!-- Page 27 --&gt;

SEMI M51-0303 © SEMI 2002, 20035 some of the proper C-mode events in which the gateoxide was not broken down are counted B-modefailures. Both cases will be taken as a mistake in theclassification of the failure modes, even if themeasurement is accurately done and the appropriate I-Vcurves measurements are achieved. A dielectricbreakdown judgment current of 105 A isrecommended. 6 Significance and Use6.1 This standard gives instructions of the procedurefor characterizing mirror-polished, p-type CZ siliconwafers by measuring the dielectric breakdown defectdensity in the thermally grown gate oxide film using theMOS capacitors. The MOS capacitors must be formedin accordance with the fabrication process described inSection 5 that influences the oxide characteristics.6.2 It is well known that both the silicon surfacemorphology and the cross-sectional structure at thepattern edge of the active region of the MOS devicesinfluences the dielectric breakdown of the gate oxide.Various kinds of contaminations also influence thedielectric breakdown of the gate oxide. Contamination by alkaline or heavy metals and organic particlesincreases as the sample fabrication process progresses.Furthermore, COPs increase with increasing SC-1treatment. These facts indicate that it is desirable tosimplify the sample structure and its fabricationprocesses to characterize a silicon wafer by TZDB ofthe gate oxide. Thermal processes can cause growth ofoxygen precipitates in a silicon wafer. This standardcannot be applied to silicon wafers that might receivesuch thermal processes.6.3 The appropriate area and the appropriate totalnumber of the tested MOS capacitors shall be chosen soas to answer the purpose of this standard test. Forexample, as shown in Table R1-3, it is suitable to selecta gate electrode area of 10 mm2 and a total number ofcapacitors of more than 100.6.4 The electrode material of the MOS capacitors has agreat influence on the dielectric breakdown of the gateoxide. Polysilicon is specified as the electrode materialin this standard. It is applied to practical ultra large-scale integrated circuits (ULSI). The polysiliconelectrode yields test results highly consistent with theactual ULSI performance. 1E-111E-91E-71E-51E-31E-1 0 4 8 12 16Ebd (MV/cm) Current (A) Ig &gt; 1E-7 A -4-3-2-1012 0 4 8 12 16Ebd (MV/cm) (ln(-ln(1-P))) B-mode C-modeA-mode Ig &gt; 1E-3 A Ig &gt; 1E-5 A Ig &gt; 1E-7 A 1E-111E-91E-71E-51E-31E-1 0 4 8 12 16Ebd (MV/cm) Current (A)Ig &gt; 1E-5 A -4-3-2-1012 0 4 8 12 16Ebd (MV/cm) (ln(-ln(1-P))) B-mode C-modeA-mode 1E-111E-91E-71E-51E-31E-1 0 4 8 12 16Ebd (MV/cm) Current (A) Ig &gt; 1E-3 A -4-3-2-1012 0 4 8 12 16Ebd (MV/cm) (ln(-ln(1-P))) B-mode C-modeA-mode Figure 1Comparison of Judgment Conditions

SEMI M51-0303 © SEMI 2002, 2003 6 7 Interferences7.1 Since this is a DC measurement, care must be takento make sure that the silicon wafer has a low resistanceohmic contact. There must be no dielectric film on theback surface, e.g. silicon oxide, in order to effectivelyapply a voltage bias to the gate oxide. It is notnecessary for this to be done with a metallic contact tothe back surface of the wafer under test.7.1.1 However, when the vacuum chucking is weak,care must be taken because of the possibility that thedielectric breakdown voltage of the gate oxide is notaccurately measured due to an increase in parasiticresistance.7.2 It is strongly suggested that testing be done with avoltage polarity such that the silicon surface will be inaccumulation below the gate oxide, that is, negativevoltages for p-type silicon wafers. If the polarity of thevoltage is chosen to be in the reverse direction, thebreakdown voltage may not be accurately measured dueto the presence of a depletion layer below the gateoxide.7.3 Evaluation and control of electrical noise in thecurrent-voltage data, as part of this test method arecrucial to the proper identification of the failure criteria.7.4 In the TZDB measurement, lowering of theelectrical noise under a low bias stress condition ismade possible by the averaging of measurement data.While the required 100 ms holding time may be setusing a delay in the measurement loop, an additional,uncontrolled delay may be incurred due to theautoranging of an electrometer. The effect is mostpronounced for very low oxide leakage currents, wherethe measured value is several orders of magnitudebelow the minimum range set by the electrometersoftware.7.5 Mechanical stress by the exploring probe caninfluence the measurement results, because theexploring probe is in contact with the gate electrodedirectly on the gate oxide.7.6 The actual results obtained depend somewhat onthe sample fabrication process. Care must be taken toensure consistent processing.7.7 Wafer temperature during testing shall be clearlydefined. Large temperature variations might have animpact on results.7.8 Precaution  Since the voltages and currentsinvolved are potentially dangerous, appropriate meansof preventing the operator from coming into contactwith the exploring probe or other charge surfaces shallbe in place before testing. 7.9 This standard does not include any clauses relatingto the safety and sanitation of the environment. Thosewho intend to implement this standard shall considerappropriate means to prevent any accidents or disasters,as well as taking responsibility for maintaining a stateof safety, health and hygiene for users. 8 Apparatus8.1 The MOS capacitors shall be fabricated in anenvironment of 1000 class or better in total quality toprevent various contaminations. Contamination controlin the processes from the wafer cleaning step to thepolysilicon deposition step is especially important.Contamination during those processes has beenreported to degrade GOI. Therefore, attention must bepaid to those processes in particular.8.2 High purity deionized water and high puritychemicals of electronics industry grade shall be used inthe processes of wafer cleaning, wet etching, etc. Thechemical/pure water grade and guide are referenced inSEMI Standards C21, C27, C28, C30, C35, C38, C41,and C44; and ASTM D5127.8.3 In thermal processes such as gate oxidation,polysilicon deposition, and phosphorus doping,fluctuations in process temperature may affect theuniformity of oxide thickness, polysilicon thickness,and the concentration and distribution of dopedphosphorus atoms. The temperature fluctuation of usedfurnaces shall be within ± 5°C at the most.8.4 Quartz is very resistant to the strong acidsexcluding hydrofluoric acidand alkalis used in wetprocesses and at temperatures higher than 1000C.Therefore, quartz vessels, tubes, and so on are quitefrequently used in the ULSI manufacturing processes.High-purity quartz vessels and tubes of electronicsindustry grade shall also be used in this MOS capacitorfabrication process.8.5 High-purity gases of electronics industry grade,such as N 2, O 2 and SiH4, shall be used in the processesof thermal oxidation, polysilicon deposition,phosphorous doping, and so on to preventcontamination from the gases. The process gas gradeand guide are referred in SEMI Standards C3.6, C3.21,C3.22, C3.23, C3.28, C3.41, C3.49, and C3.54.8.6 A criterion for evaluating a clean roomenvironment where MOS samples are fabricated for thistest method is that the A-mode failure percent of thesamples with 2025 nm oxide is less than 10%. It isadvisable that the level of cleanliness of the clean roomenvironment where the tested MOS capacitors arefabricated is evaluated by TZDB measurement of theMOS capacitors on an epitaxial wafer.

However, if testing is done as part ofcomparison or correlation, all participants shall agreeupon sampling in advance.NOTE 9: Refer to the appendix of JEDEC 35 for a gooddiscussion of sampling plan statistics. 10 Procedure10.1 Fabrication of MOS Capacitors10.1.1 It shall be confirmed first that the environmentfor fabricating MOS capacitors is suitable for this testmethod. The environment includes clean room,chemicals, ultra pure deionized water, oxidationfurnace, polysilicon deposition equipment, differentkinds of quartz jigs, etc. As a criterion for evaluatingthe suitability of an environment, the A-mode failurepercent of the MOS capacitors made in the environmentshall be less than 10%.10.1.2 To characterize proper silicon wafers, thewafers shall not be cleaned.

The flatbandvoltage shift is due to gate-substrate work functiondifference \[ms\] and oxide fixed charge \[Qf \]. Althoughit is better to consider this flatband voltage shift, itsinfluence on the oxide film thickness in the rangerecommended is small.11.4 Calculation of Defect Density11.4.1 Calculate the defect density using the followingequation based on the Poisson distribution assumptionof the dielectric breakdown defects (see StandardEIA/JEDEC 35):ox = -ln(1-F)/S (5)where:ox = Defect density (defects/cm2) F = Failure fraction for each oxide breakdown modeS = Capacitor gate area (cm2)Example: Given a total of 100 MOS capacitors tested,with 30 B-mode-failed capacitors and a gate area of 10mm2, the defect density would be as follows:ox = -ln(1-(30/100))/0.1 = 3.6 defects/cm2 (6)11.5 Weibull Distribution11.5.1 To convert cumulative percent to Weibullformat (sometimes referred to as smallest extremevalue probability distribution III), use the followingequation:ln(-ln(1-F)) (7)where ln is the natural log operator and F is a percent ofthe cumulative failures.

SEMI M51-0303 © SEMI 2002, 200311 RELATED INFORMATION 1OUTLINE OF ROUND ROBIN NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI M51 and is not intended to modify or supersedethe proposed standard. It is provided for information purposes. R1-1 MOS StructureR1-1.1 Gate Oxide ThicknessR1-1.1.1 In this round robin, we evaluated the GOI ofMOS capacitors with a gate oxide film thickness of 25nm on mirror-polished, p-type, CZ silicon wafers. Inthe TZDB evaluation, a negative electric field wasapplied step by step from 0 to 15 MV/cm, and an oxideleakage current value was measured. When the oxideleakage current first exceeded the dielectric breakdownjudgment value, we judged that the gate oxide filmdielectrically broke down. 0.01 0.10 1.00 10.00 100.00 0.01 0.10 1.00 10.00 100.00Defect Density by OPP \[cm-2\] Defect Density by TZDB \[cm -2 \] CG OPP Defect Density (cm -2 ) =OPP-data x 10-5 cm Tox = 25 nmS = 10 mm 2 Figure R1-1The Relationship between B-Mode Defect Density byTZDB and OPP R1-1.1.2 The above graph shows the relationshipbetween the B-mode defect density of 25 nm thickoxide by TZDB and the particles by optical precipitateprofiler (OPP). Here, based on an assumption that thedielectric breakdown defect is in conformance with thePoisson distribution, the defect density by TZDB of 25nm thick oxide, , was calculated from the dielectricbreakdown failure fraction of TZDB, F, as follows.ox = -ln(1  F)/S (8)Here, S is a gate electrode area of the evaluated MOScapacitors.R1-1.1.3 The defect density was obtained by the B-mode failure percent, F, of TZDB. On the other hand,estimation of the defect density by OPP was carried out as follows. The OPP defects were measured in thewafers at the same position (ingot) of the same Sicrystal as the sample wafers. The density of COPswhich appeared on the silicon wafer surface wasestimated from the volume defect density, n(cm-3 ), andthe COP diameter, L(cm). The area density of thedefects which appear at the silicon surface can beestimated with n  L, assuming that the COP diameter,L, is almost uniform and the volume defect density, n,is uniformly distributed. Here, 0.1 m was used as theL value7 and the measurement results of the OPPtechnique as the n value. The resulting OPP defectdensities, by which each of the three kinds of siliconwafers, H, M, and L, was characterized, were asfollows.H: n = 7.83  10 5(cm-3 )  ox = 7.8(cm-2 )M: n = 2.89  10 5(cm-3 )  ox = 2.9(cm-2 )L: n ≤ 1  10 4(cm-3 )  ox ≤ 0.1(cm-2 )In the above graph, C and G are the measurementresults for MOS capacitors made by two different wafervendors. The defect density by TZDB and the defectdensity by OPP can be seen to be in a relation of almost1:1 in this figure. These facts mean that the B modefailure of the 25 nm thick gate oxide is mainlyattributable to the COPs that appear at the silicon wafersurface. Moreover, these results indicate that thisstandard test method can give us an evaluation of theoxide defect densities over the wide range of COPdefect density with excellent reproducibility.R1-1.2 Total Number and Electrode Area of MeasuredMOS CapacitorsR1-1.2.1 To measure the defect density with a highdegree of accuracy, a large number of MOS capacitorswith a large electrode area shall be measured.However, measurement of too large an area or toomany MOS capacitors leads to unnecessary evaluationload. The appropriate area size and the total number ofMOS capacitors needed to evaluate the defect density atthe silicon wafer surface shall be selected according tothe foreseen defect density and the purpose of theevaluation. For instance, if the purpose is to evaluate aconventional, mirror-polished, CZ silicon wafer with adefect density of 110/cm2, about 100 MOS capacitorswith an electrode area of 1020 mm2 must be measured.R1-1.2.2 When the Poisson's distribution is assumed asa defect distribution, as mentioned above, the yield, Y,

&lt;!-- Page 34 --&gt;

SEMI M51-0303 © SEMI 2002, 2003 12 of MOS capacitors with an electrode area of S and adefect density of ox is given by the following equation.Y = 1  F = exp(-ox S)R1-1.2.3 The failure fraction, F, is calculated using thisexpression. Here, the necessary MOS capacitornumber, n, for the observation of one breakdown MOScapacitor is assumed to be 1/F. Thus, this n wascalculated from the value of S and ox as shown inTable R1-1.Table R1-1 Necessary number for observation ofone breakdown MOS capacitor1/F = Necessary number for observation of one breakdownMOS capacitorS (mm2 ) 1 5 10 20 50ox = 10 cm-2 11 3 2 1 1ox = 1 cm-2 101 21 11 6 3ox = 0.1 cm-2 1001 201 101 51 21 R1-1.2.4 In the same way, the yield probability, Y, andnecessary number, n, for observation of available MOScapacitors was calculated as indicated in Table R1-2.Table R1-2 Necessary number for observation ofavailable MOS capacitors1/Y = Necessary number for observation of available MOScapacitorsS (mm2 ) 1 5 10 20 50ox = 10 cm-2 1 2 3 7 148ox = 1 cm-2 1 1 1 1 2ox = 0.1 cm-2 1 1 1 1 1 R1-1.2.5 The number of needed MOS capacitors isshown in Table R1-3 though both 1/F and 1/Y weredone to one or more. To observe ten MOS capacitorsor more respectively in an actual evaluation includingreproducibility, the number of MOS capacitors requiredfor the measurement will then be multiplied by ten andreaches the value shown in Table R1-3 below.Table R1-3 Necessary number of MOS capacitors(in the case of ox = 1 or 10)S (mm2 ) 1 5 10 20 50Confirmation ofbreakdown (ox = 1)101 21 11 6 3 Confirmation of alive(ox = 10)1 2 3 7 148 Necessary number(large one in above)101 21 11 7 148 10 1010 210 110 70 1480 R1-1.2.5.2 In Table R1-3, the term confirmation ofbreakdown (ox = 1) means the number of elementsnecessary to confirm at least one breakdown in the caseof ox = 1, and the term of confirmation of alive(ox = 10) means the number of elements necessary toconfirm at least one alive in the case of ox = 10.R1-1.2.6 When a silicon wafer with a surface defectdensity of 10/cm2 is measured, if MOS capacitors withan electrode area of 50 mm2 are used, it breaks down.Therefore, it is unsuitable for the comparativeevaluation of the defect distribution as in this test.R1-1.2.7 To confirm that 10 MOS capacitors arealive or dead, it is necessary to measure 70 MOScapacitors with an electrode area of 20 mm2, or 110MOS capacitors of 10 mm2, or 210 MOS capacitors of5 mm2.R1-1.2.8 When the defect density of a sample wafer is0.1/cm2, we can confirm broken 10 MOS capacitors of50 mm2 by measurement of only 210 MOS capacitors.For MOS capacitors of 1 mm2, it will be necessary tomeasure about 10,000, and this is not realistic.R1-1.3 Recommended Measurement ConditionR1-1.3.1 The electric field step, E step, and hold time,Thold, used in this round robin are shown in Figure R1-2.R1-1.3.2 In TZDB measurement, the voltage isincreased with each step. Then, the electric current ismeasured after a constant hold time. This hold time isusually initiated as a time period required formeasurement stabilization. It is possible thatmeasurement results are influenced by voltageinstability when the hold time is shorter than 100 ms.R1-1.3.3 On the other hand, because too long a holdtimethat is, 800 ms or moreleads to a long totalmeasurement time, the influence of TDDB becomesconspicuous in the high electrical field region, and it ispossible that the breakdown failure fraction of the MOScapacitors increases.R1-1.3.4 In Figure R1-2, the B-mode failure percentsare shown as a function of the hold time of the appliedelectric field stress with a step height of 0.25 MV/cm.A hold time from 100 ms to 800 ms did not have anyparticular influence in the measurement results of thisround robin. Thus, we have proposed 200 ms as apracticable recommended hold time.R1-1.3.5 In this TZDB measurement, the appliedelectric field was increased each step directly after thecurrent measurement. Too low a step height of theapplied electric field, Ethat is, 0.1 MV/cm or lessleads to an unnecessarily long measurement time, andthe influence of TDDB becomes conspicuous in thehigh electrical field region.

SEMI M51-0303 © SEMI 2002, 200313 R1-1.3.6 On the other hand, too high a stepping-up ofthe applied electric field stress, for example, 1.0MV/cm or more, leads to broadening of the dielectricbreakdown electric field. That is, the reliability of themeasurement result is decreased.R1-1.3.7 In this round robin as shown in Figure R1-4,the B-mode failure percent did not depend on the step height of the applied electric field stress with a holdtime of 200 ms. An electric field step height of 0.1-0.5MV/cm did not cause any problems in the measurementresults. Therefore, considering the above practicalfactors, a step height range of 0.10.5 MV/cm, andespecially, 0.25 MV/cm are recommended.

The spatialdistribution of scattered light from COPs and particlesis different, and therefore these two classes of defectsmay be distinguished by an appropriately equippedSSIS. COPs were first detected by SSIS and believedto be small particles. It was also noticed that afterrepeated cleaning (etching) the number of the COPsincreased as the etching process enlarged the pits andchanged their scattering characteristics. Later thesedefects were identified as voids caused by thecoalescence of vacancies during the cooling of thesilicon crystal from its growth temperature. The termcrystal originated particle had already become accepted,and even today many people still refer to COPs by theiroriginal, though incorrect name.

SEMI M52-0703 © SEMI 2002, 200313 Item Recommended Specification Comments References3.3 Calibration automated, In order to reduce PSLsphere sizinguncertainty in the65 nm to 200 nm range,the diameterdistribution should havea full width at halfmaximum (FWHM)≤5%. In addition, it isdesirable that the peakPSL diameter asdeposited on the waferhave a relativeexpanded uncertainty atabout 95% confidencelevel as small aspossible but not greaterthan 3%. See NOTE 2. SEMI M53 NOTE 1: At the calibration points, if it is assumed that the SSIS sizing of PSL spheres is exactly correct, then the sizing error is caused bydifferences between the response predicted by the calibration curve and the exact response of the SSIS away from calibration points. Details forcalculating this error are being developed for another standard.NOTE 2: This specification limits the width of the diameter distribution of PSL spheres as they appear on the wafer in the calibration deposition.The deposition system transfer function (often nominally triangular in shape) times the actual PSL diameter distribution shape presented to thesystem defines the deposition width. Thus the width of the deposition on the wafer is no larger than the width of the transfer function. A narrowwidth decreases calibration uncertainty in three ways. First, in the presence of background noise, it makes the distribution peak signal easier tolocate. Second, a narrow transfer function makes the deposition distribution peak easier to determine. Third, a narrow transfer function reducesthe deposition distribution asymmetry if the input PSL distribution is not symmetrical about the peak value.

SEMI M53-1103 © SEMI 20031 SEMI M53-1103PRACTICE FOR CALIBRATING SCANNING SURFACE INSPECTIONSYSTEMS USING DEPOSITIONS OF MONODISPERSE POLYSTYRENELATEX SPHERE ON UNPATTERNED SEMICONDUCTOR WAFERSURFACES This practice was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on July 25, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org October2003; to be published November 2003. Originally published March 2003. 1 Purpose1.1 Calibration of a scanning surface inspection system(SSIS) using a deposition of polystyrene latex (PSL)spheres as a known source of scatter signal is anecessary step in matching the responses of SSISs.However, the measured amplitude of the light scattersignal depends on both the characteristics of the SSISand the characteristics of the scatter source. The use ofa deposition of polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres (seeSection 5.3.4) as a known source of scatter signalallows meaningful comparisons to be made betweenscatter signals from PSL spheres as measured by darkfield detection systems of different designs. On theother hand, calibration with PSL spheres alone does notguarantee meaningful performance comparisons to bemade between dark field detection SSISs of the same ordifferent designs when detecting either real particles ofmaterials different from PSL spheres or other surfacedefects.1.2 This practice describes calibration of SSIS darkfield channels so that the SSIS accurately sizes PSLspheres deposited on unpatterned polished, epitaxial, orfilmed semiconductor wafer surfaces (see RelatedInformation 1).1.3 This practice defines the use of latex sphereequivalent (LSE) signals as a means of reporting realsurface defects whose identity and true size areunknown.1.4 This practice provides a basis for quantifying SSISperformance as used in related standards concernedwith parameters such as sensitivity, repeatability andcapture rate. 2 Scope2.1 This practice covers Requirements for the surface and othercharacteristics of the semiconductor substrates onwhich the PSL spheres are deposited to formreference wafers (see Section 8.1),  Selection of appropriate certified depositions ofPSL spheres for SSIS calibration (see Section 8.2), Size distribution requirements to be met by thePSL sphere depositions (but not the depositionmethod), and Multipoint calibration procedures for dark fieldchannels.2.2 Appendix 1 covers a single-point calibrationprocedure that may be used in limited productionapplications.2.3 PSL spheres from 10 m to the smallest size thatcan be detected by the SSIS being calibrated can beused in this practice.NOTE 1: At the time of development of this edition of thepractice, the smallest practical deposited PSL spheres havediameters approaching 30 nm, but as IC technology evolves tosmaller and smaller critical dimensions it is expected thatdepositions of smaller diameter PSL spheres will becomeavailable.2.4 Background information to enable anunderstanding of the need for the various requirementsimposed on the PSL sphere depositions is provided inRelated Information 1.2.5 Both the deposition process and calibrationprocedures must be carried out in a Class 4 or betterenvironment as defined in ISO 14644-1.NOTE 2: ISO class 4 is approximately the same as ClassM2.5 (Class 10) as defined in Federal Standard 209E.2.6 Although it was developed primarily for use inevaluation of SSISs to be used for detection of localizedlight scatterers (LLSs) on polished silicon wafers withgeometrical characteristics as specified in SEMI M1,this practice can be applied to SSISs to be used fordetection of LLSs on other unpatterned semiconductorsurfaces provided that suitable reference wafers areemployed.2.7 This practice does not in any way attempt to definethe manner in which LSE values are used to define the
