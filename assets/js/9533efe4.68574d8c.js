They do not indicate the uncertainty or\nprecision  of  the  estimate.    Precision  varies  depending\nupon the number of failures observed and the amount of\nproductive   time   contained   within   the   observation\nperiod.\n7. 2    Precision  is  described  by  calculating  a  lower  and\nupper  confidence  limit  for  the  MTBF\np\nand  presenting\nthis interval along with the MTBF\np\npoint estimate.\n7. 3  These  procedures  assume  that  the  failure  rate  is\nconstant     and     the     times     between     failures     are\nindependently  distributed  according  to  the  exponential\ndistribution.    Therefore,  there  are  no  improvement  or\ndegradation  trends  and  it  is  meaningful  to  calculate\nMTBF\np\n.    Section  8  applies  when  the  failure  times\nindicate  that  a  non-constant  failure  rate  is  present  (for\nexample,    when    there    is    reliability    growth    or\ndegradation).    Section  8  would  typically  apply  during\nprototype reliability improvement testing.\n7. 4  Since MTTR distributions are unlikely to follow an\nexponential   distribution   assumption,   applying   these\nprocedures to put confidence limits on MTTR would be\ninappropriate.\n7. 5    Note  that  all  procedures  and  tables  referred  to  in\nthis   section   apply   equally   well   to   measuring   the\nprecision  of  estimates  for  similar  metrics,  where  hours\nare  replaced  by  cycles  or  units,  for  example.    These\nprocedures apply to E-MTBF\np\nor E-MCBF in the same\nway.    It  is  also  appropriate  to  combine  data  from\nidentical  tools  being  used  the  same  way,  in  order  to\nimprove the precision of MTBF\np\nestimates.\n7. 6  Calculation of Lower and Upper Confidence Limits\n\xf3  To  obtain  lower  and  upper  MTBF\np\nlimits,  multiply\nthe  MTBF\np\nestimate  by  factors  obtained  by  table  look-\nup (Tables A1-1 and A1-2 in Appendix 1).  For the case\nwhen  there  are  zero  failures  during  the  measurement\nperiod,  lower  confidence  limit  factors  for  the  MTBF\np"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"are given in the first row of Table A1-1 (they multiply\nthe  amount  of  productive  time  that  had  no  failures  to\nobtain  the  desired  MTBF\np\nlower  limit).    There  is  no\nupper  limit  estimate  for  performance  when  there  are\nzero failures.\n7. 6.1  Calculation  of  the  MTBF\np\nLower  Limit  \xf3  Use\nTable  A1-1  in  Appendix  1  to  obtain  a  k\nr;conf\nfactor,\nwhere r  is  the  number  of  failures  observed  during  the\nmeasurement  period  and  conf  is  the  confidence  level\ndesired.      The   rows   of   Table   A1-1   correspond   to\ndifferent  values  of  r  and  the  columns  correspond  to\ndifferent  values  of  conf.    Confidence  levels  ranging\nfrom 80 percent to 95 percent are typical choices.\n7. 6.1.1      Since   the   equipment   being   measured   has\ndemonstrated  (at  a  given  confidence  level)  that  it  is  at\nleast as good as the MTBF\np\nlower limit, this lower limit\nis  an  important  and  useful  performance  statistic,  and  is\noften used contractually.\n7. 6.1.2    Note  that  the  factors  in  Table  A1-1  for  90%\nconfidence are less than 0.5 until the number of failures\nequals or exceeds 4.  This means that when the number\nof  failures  is  under  4,  the  MTBF\nP\nlower  limit  will  be\nless  than  half  the  MTBF\np\nestimate,  and  confidence\nintervals  will  be  wide.    From  the  point  of  view  of\nprecision,  it  is  advantageous  to  have  had  4  or  more\nfailures.\n7. 6.1.3  Example:  During  a  given  calendar  quarter,  a\ntool  was  productive  for  1200  hours  and  had  6  failures.\nThe  MTBF\np\nestimate  is  1200/6  =  200  hours.  A  90\npercent     lower     limit     factor     from     Table     A1-1\n(corresponding  to  r =  6  failures)  is  0.570.    That  means\nthat  200  \u25ca  0.570  =  114.0  hours  is  a  90  percent  lower\nconfidence limit for the true tool MTBF\np\n.\n7. 6.2  Calculation  of  the  MTBF\np\nUpper  Limit  \xf3  Use\nTable  A1-2  in  Appendix  1  to  obtain  a  k\nr;conf\nfactor,\nwhere r  is  the  number  of  failures  observed  during  the\nmeasurement  period  and  conf  is  the  confidence  level\ndesired.      The   rows   of   Table   A1-2   correspond   to\ndifferent  values  of  r  and  the  columns  correspond  to\ndifferent  values  of  conf.    Confidence  levels  ranging\nfrom 80 percent to 95 percent are typical choices.\n7. 6.2.1  Example:  During  a  given  calendar  quarter,  a\ntool  was  productive  for  1200  hours  and  had  6  failures.\nThe  MTBF\np\nestimate  is  1200/6  =  200  hours.    A  90\npercent    upper    limit    factor    from    Table    A1-2\n(corresponding  to  r =  6  failures)  is  1.904.    That  means\nthat  200  \u25ca  1.904  =  380.8  hours  is  a  90  percent  upper\nconfidence limit for the true tool MTBF\np\n.\n7. 6.3  Calculation   of   a   Confidence   Interval   for   the\nMTBF\np\n\xf3 Lower and upper 100 \u25ca (1 \xf1 \u03b1/2) confidence\nlimits for the MTBF\np\ncan be combined to give a 100 \u25ca\n(1  \xf1  \u03b1)  confidence  interval.    Here  \u03b1/2  is  the  chance  of\nmissing  on  either  end  of  the  interval.    A  90  percent\nlower  limit  has  an  \u03b1/2  =  0.1  chance  of  not  being  low\nenough to capture the true MTBF\np\n, and the same is true\nfor  a  90  percent  upper  limit.    Therefore,  a  90  percent\nlower  limit  and  a  90  percent  upper  limit  combine  to\ngive an 80 percent confidence interval.  Similarly, a 95\npercent lower limit and a 95 percent upper limit would\ncombine to give a 90 percent confidence interval.\n7. 6.3.1  Example: During a calendar quarter, a tool was\nproductive  for  1200  hours  and  had  6  failures.    The\nMTBF\np\nestimate is 1200/6 = 200 hours.  The 90 percent\nlower  and  upper  limits  are  114  and  380.8  respectively\n(see  Sections  7.6.1  and  7.6.2).    The  interval  (114,"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E10-0304\nE\n\xa9 SEMI 1986, 2004 11\n380. 8) is then an 80 percent confidence interval for the\ntrue tool MTBF\np\n.\n7. 6.4  Calculation  of  the  MTBF\np\nLower  Bound  when\nthere  are  Zero  Failures  \u2014  Use  the  first  row  of  Table\nA1-1  (corresponding  to  r =  0)  to  obtain  a  k\n0;conf\nfactor\ncorresponding to the desired confidence level.  Multiply\nthe  length  of  the  measurement  period  by  this  factor  to\nobtain the lower limit estimate.\n7. 6.4.1  Example: During a calendar quarter, a tool was\nproductive for 1200 hours and had zero failures.  From\nTable A1-1, the 90% confidence level lower limit factor\nis 0.434.  That means that 1200 \u25ca 0.434 = 520.8 hours,\nis  a  90%  lower  confidence  limit  estimate  for  the  true\ntool MTBF\np\n.\n7. 6.5    Choosing  a  test  length  in  order  to  be  able  to\ndemonstrate  a  required  MTBF\np\nat  a  given  confidence,\nwe  first  must  pick  a  maximum  number  of  failures,  r,\nthat can occur during the test period and still allow us to\nconfirm   a   required   MTBF\np\nobjective   at   a   given\nconfidence  level.    Next,  the  length  of  test  time  needed\ncan  be  calculated  using  the  factors  in  Table  A1-4  in\nAppendix  1.    The  required  MTBF\np\nis  multiplied  by  a\nfactor  based  on  r  and  the  desired  confidence  level  to\nobtain the total test time needed.\n7. 6.5.1    Note  that  minimum  test  times  are  obtained  by\nallowing  no  failures.    The  cost,  however,  of  using  a\nminimum test length is to increase the possibility of an\nacceptable   tool   failing   the   test   by   chance.      As\nmentioned  in  the  discussion  in  Section  6.2.1,  it  is\nadvantageous  to  design  a  test  that  allows  up  to  4\nfailures, whenever possible.\n7. 6.5.2  Example:  We  would  like  to  confirm  a  tool\nMTBF\np\nof  400  hours  at  an  80%  confidence  level.  We\nwant to be able to pass a qualification test with 4 or less\nfailures.  We look up the appropriate factor from Table\nA1-4 and find 6.72.  That means the length of test time\nrequired is 400 \u25ca 6.72 = 2688 hours.  We can do this on\none  tool  or  split  the  test  time  across  several  tools.\nWhen we have accumulated 2688 hours and if 4 or less\nfailures  have  occurred,  the  MTBF\np\nobjective  of  400\nhours  will  have  been  confirmed  at  (at  least)  the  80%\nconfidence level.\n8  Reliability Growth or Degradation\nMeasurement\n8. 1      The   previous   calculations   are   meaningful   only\nwhen  the  MTBF\np\n(or  MCBF)  and  E-MTBF\np\n(or  E-\nMCBF)  are  constant  over  the  measurement  period.    If\nreliability    is    improving    (typical    during    design\nverification  and  debug  and  also  early  life  run-in)  or  if\nreliability  is  degrading  (typical  near  the  end  of  life  for\nthe  piece  of  equipment,  or  if  certain  sub-assemblies\nhave  been  over-stressed  and  are  wearing  out)  then  an\noverall    MTBF\np\ncalculation    is    inappropriate    and\nmisleading  and  other  methods  must  be  used.    Exact\ntime  of  failure  recording  is  required  in  order  to  detect\nreliability    improvement    or    reliability    degradation\ntrends, and to fit appropriate models.\n8. 2  Exact Time of Failure Recording \u2014 Clock times of\nfailure  must  be  converted  to  durations  of  cumulative\nproductive time as measured from the initial productive\nuse   of   the   tool   (set   as   time   0).      This   is   easily\naccomplished if total time is continuously monitored by\nduration within each of the six equipment states.\n8. 2.1  Example:  A  machine  is  intended  for  use  during\nfirst  shift  operation  five  days  a  week.    For  simplicity,\nassume  100%  productive  utilization.    After  the  first\nthree  weeks  of  use,  it  fails  half-way  through  the  day,\nand  is  not  repaired  until  the  start  of  the  next  day\xeds\noperation.  No more failures occur before the end of the\nfirst four weeks of operation.  The exact time of failure\nis 124 hours (three weeks of 5 \u25ca 8 = 40 hours per week\nplus half of an 8 hour day).  If a second failure occurred\ntwo hours into the third day of the fifth week, the exact\ntime of failure would be 174 hours.\n8. 3  Reliability   Growth   (Degradation)   Models   \u2014   A\nuseful family of reliability growth (degradation) models\nwas  developed  by  the  U.S.  Army  Materials  Systems\nAnalysis    Activity.        These    AMSAA    models    are\ndescribed  in  Appendix  2,  along  with  a  general  test  for\nreliability  growth  (degradation)  trends.    Exact  time  of\nfailure data is needed to test for trends, fit an AMSAA\nmodel,  and  test  the  fit  for  adequacy.    The  failures  used\nto  fit  the  model  must  occur  during  productive  time\n(other  failures  can  occur,  but  these  are  not  used  to  fit\nreliability models)."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E10-0304\nE\n\xa9 SEMI 1986, 2004 12\nAPPENDIX 1\nCONFIDENCE BOUND FACTORS\nNOTICE:  This  appendix  was  approved  as  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E10  by  full  letter  ballot  procedure.
