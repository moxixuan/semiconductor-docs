Matrix.  8-bit  characters  may  also  be  encoded  with
reduced  field  capacity.  The  first  20  characters  shall
contain two elements:
a. a vendor-assigned 15-character mask identification
code, followed
by
b. a 1-character field concatenation symbol (+) and 2-
character field ID (per ANSI MH 10.8)
9. 5.3   The  next  26  message  character s  shall  contain
two elements:
a. a  customer-assigned  13-character  part  #,  followed
by
b. a   1-character   field   concatenation   symbol   (+)
followed by a 2-character field ID and
c. a   12-character   customer-assigned   part   revision
number.
9. 5.4 The  remaining  message  charac ters,  if  any,  shall
contain  information  as  agreed  between  the  vendor  and
the  user.  This  may  require  field  identifiers  and  field
concatenation.
9. 5.4.1   Field  identifiers  listed  in  ANS I  MH  10.8.2
include:
a. Customer part number revision: 2P
b. Customer specification number: 20P
c. Customer specification revision: 21P

GUIDE FOR FLAT PANEL DISPLAY EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATION
INTERFACES
This  guide  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Flat  Panel  Display  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Flat  Panel  Display  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  28,  2000.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  August
2000; to be published October 2000.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1    This   is   a   guide   for   implementi ng   equipment
communication  features  for  successful  integration  and
automation   in   a   flat   panel   display   manufacturing
facility.
2  Scope</li><li>1   This  guide  includes  references   to  other  SEMI
standards.  It  also  includes  definitions  and  explanations
specific to FPD equipment automation.</li><li>2   The  scope  of  this  guide  is  limi ted  to  equipment
communication   features   that   interface   with   factory
automation systems.</li><li>3  This guide does not reference  physical or electrical
interfaces,  except  to  the  extent  necessary  to  implement
the features described. For example, a serial data cable
connector could be specified to have 9 pins or 25 pins.</li><li>4   This  guide  may  not  be  applica ble  to  all  types  of
FPD  equipment.    It  only  applies  to  those  for  which  a
direct     data     communication     interface     will     be
implemented  between  the  equipment  and  the  factory
automation systems.</li><li>5  This guide does not address al l software standards
that  may  be  applicable,  but  addresses  a  subset  that  is
necessary for effective integration and automation.</li><li>6   This  standard  does  not  purport   to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.   It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1   The  other  SEMI  standards  refe rred  to  in  this
document     have     been     carefully     reviewed     for
applicability  to  FPD  manufacturing.  However,  when
referring   to   other   SEMI   standards   used   in   this
specification, the reader should allow for some editorial
exceptions  in  order  to  apply  the  specification  to  FPD
equipment. For example, if another SEMI specification
referenced  here  uses  the  term  “wafer”,  the  reader  can
assume  that  this  also  applies  to  FPD  substrates,  and
likewise   with   “silicon”   and   glass   or   plastic.   These
minor differences in no way impact the interpretation or
implementation      of      those      standards      in      FPD
manufacturing equipment and factory systems.</li><li>2  This guide is not an all-inclusi ve list of applicable
standards,    but    is    a    starting    point    for    defining
requirements  of  these  equipment  automation  functions,
and a guideline for implementation.
4  Referenced Standards
NOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be the
latest publications of adopted standards.</li><li>1  SEMI Standards

5  Terminology</li><li>1   The  following  define  some  des criptive  terms  that
can   be   used   to   refer   to   systems   that   meet   the
requirements of the standards referenced herein.</li><li>1.1  SECS  Compliant — This  term   is  often  used  to
describe  systems  which  comply  completely  with  both
the   SEMI   E4   (SECS-I)   and   SEMI   E5   (SECS-II)
standards.    However,  it  is  more  appropriate  to  identify
the  system  as  “SECS-I  Compliant”  and/or  “SECS-II”
compliant.  This distinction is important because SECS-
II can be implemented independently from SECS-I. The
term  “SECS  Compliant”  is  ambiguous,  but  commonly
used.    It  is  suggested  that  the  following  terms  be  used</li></ol><p>SEMI D27-1000 © SEMI 20002
instead     to     describe     the     equipment     and     host
communication interface.
5. 1.2   SECS-I  Compliant   —   This   term    is   used   to
identify  a  system  that  complies  completely  with  SEMI
E4.
5. 1.3   SECS-II  Compliant  —  This  ter m  is  used  to
identify  a  system  that  complies  completely  with  SEMI
E5.
5. 1.4    HSMS   Compliant   —   This   term    is   used   to
describe   systems   which   comply   with   SEMI   E37
(HSMS)  and  either  SEMI  E37.1  (HSMS-SS)  or  SEMI
E37.2   (HSMS-GS)   or   both.      However,   it   is   more
appropriate  to  identify  the  system  as  either  “HSMS-SS
Compliant” or “HSMS-GS Compliant”, since they both
imply  compliance  with  SEMI  E37,  and  the  user  must
know exactly which of the two is supported.  The term
“HSMS Compliant” is ambiguous, but commonly used.
5. 1.5   HSMS-SS  Compliant — This term is used to
identify  a  system  that  complies  completely  with  SEMI
E37 and SEMI E37.1.  This protocol has been adopted
for use in FPD.
5. 1.6   HSMS-GS  Compliant — This   term  is  used  to
identify  a  system  that  complies  completely  with  SEMI
E37 and SEMI E37.2.
5. 1.7  GEM — Generic Equipment M odel as defined in
SEMI E30.
5. 1.8   GEM  Compliant  —  This  term   is  defined  in
SEMI E30.
5. 1.9   Fully  GEM  Capable  —  This  te r m  is  defined  in
SEMI E30.
5. 1.10   System  —  Either  manufacturin g  equipment  or
factory host.
6  Data Transfer
6. 1  For optimum compatibility, sy stems supporting the
automation capabilities described herein should support
all   requirements   defined   for   at   least   one   of   the
following SEMI protocol standards:
6. 1.1  SEMI E4 (SECS-I)
6. 1.2  SEMI E37.1 (HSMS-SS). Not e that this requires
implementation of SEMI E37.
6. 1.2.1   HSMS-SS  compliant  interface s  are  preferred
for FPD manufacturing because of its performance and
logistical   advantages,   and   because   it   allows   other
protocols    to    operate    on    the    same    connection
simultaneously.
6. 1.2.2   However,  SECS-I  interfaces  a re  acceptable  in
systems  where  the  performance  of  a  serial  interface  is
sufficient.     Since     many     off-the-shelf     component
software  implementations  support  both  protocols,  it  is
relatively   easy   to   design   systems   which   can   be
configured to support either.
7  Data Format
7. 1     The    system    should    support    all     minimum
requirements  of  SEMI  E5  (SECS-II).    Although  more
modern     data     communication     specifications     are
available  (e.g.  HTML),  SECS-II  has  unique  aspects
which  are  valuable  in  microelectronics  manufacturing.
Also,  there  are  many  available  “off-the-shelf”  software
packages which provide the SECS-II feature set.
7. 2    Furthermore,   for   maximum   co mpatibility   and
reliability, the implementation of any optional SEMI E5
objects  (data  items,  variable  items,  messages,  etc.)  on
the  system  should  meet  the  requirements  of  SEMI  E5.
For  example,  if  an  FPD  system  implements  the  S7,F3
message, it must do so in compliance with SEMI E5 to
be  considered  “SECS-II  Compliant”.    It  is  possible  to
implement  “user-defined”  SECS-II  messages,  and  it  is
allowed by SEMI E5.
7. 3   However,  it  is  usually  unneces sary  to  use  such
custom SECS-II messages.  Complicated scenarios such
as   production   sequence   control,   inline   production,
consumable management, and material handling can all
be   implemented   using   standard   SECS-II   messages.
Many   SECS-II   messages   are   designed   to   be   very
generic and very flexible such as the Remote Command
message  (S2F41  or  S2F49)  which  can  contain  any
number of parameters of any type in any format.  Many
of  the  basic  SECS-II  data  items  such  as  variables  can
also take on any type of value in any format.
7. 4   User-defined  data  items  and  m essages  are  more
difficult   to   integrate   into   FPD   factory   automation
systems and should be avoided.
8  GEM and SEM
8. 1  Generic Equipment Model (GE M)
8. 1.1   Any  reference  to  the  term  “GE M”  (Generic
Equipment  Model)  with  respect  to  FPD  manufacturing
equipment  will  be  construed  as  a  reference  to  SEMI
E30.    The  system  provider  should  ensure  that  this  term
is  used  only  for  those  systems  which  rigidly  adhere  to
SEMI  E30.    End-users  will  make  certain  assumptions
about  the  capabilities  of  “GEM”  systems  based  on  the
requirements of SEMI E30.
8. 1.2   SEMI  E30  is  applicable  to  FPD   manufacturing
equipment.  FPD  equipment  suppliers  may  choose  to
implement  GEM.  In  order  for  FPD  equipment  to  be
“GEM  Compliant”  or  “Fully  GEM  Capable”,  it  must
meet the requirements of SEMI E30 without exception.
However, it may not be necessary to implement certain</p><p>SEMI D27-1000 © SEMI 20003
optional     GEM     capabilities     for     effective     FPD
automation.
8. 1.3    The   implementation   of   SEMI    E30,   or   lack
thereof, is usually a point of much negotiation between
equipment supplier and end-user. SEMI E30 provides a
useful template for identifying which capabilities are to
be provided and which are not.  The “GEM Compliance
Statement”   document   should   be   provided   by   the
equipment  supplier  to  describe  the  capabilities  of  the
interface, whether or not the system is GEM Compliant.
8. 1.4   GEM  is  not  applicable  to  host   systems,  but  host
systems must implement a compatible set of features to
work effectively with GEM equipment.
8. 2  Specific Equipment Model (SE M)
8. 2.1   The  concept  of  a  Specific  Equ ipment  Model,
which  requires  compliance  with  SEMI  E30  (GEM),
could  be  applied  to  FPD  equipment  as  well.    This
document does not address SEMs.  The user may wish
to  review  the  published  SEM  standards  and  determine
their applicability in an FPD implementation.
9  Interfaces to Material Tran sfer Systems
9. 1  Carrier Transfer Parallel I/O  Interfaces
9. 1.1   Material  handling  systems  are   critical  for  many
FPD manufacturing operations.  But, not all equipment
support  the  automated  transfer  of  material  to  and  from
the  equipment.    This  section  only  applies  to  systems,
which support automated carrier transfer.
9. 1.2  For compatibility with many a utomated material
handling  systems  on  the  factory  floor,  FPD  equipment
should  support  all  requirements  for  at  least  one  of  the
following SEMI carrier transfer parallel I/O standards:
9. 1.2.1  SEMI  E23  (Cassette  Transfer   Parallel  I/O
Interface)  —  Note  that  the  diagram  in  SEMI  E23
showing  placement  of  the  photo-coupled  I/O  interface
with respect to the carrier stage (CS) shows specific CS
size  measurements.  However,  this  is  just  an  example
and not a requirement of SEMI E23. The requirement is
that  the  photo  sensor  must  be  on  the  front  edge  of  the
CS and its center aligned with the center of the CS. This
applies to a CS of any size.
9. 1.2.2  SEMI    E84    (Enhanced    Carrier     Handoff
Parallel   I/O   Interface)   —   Note   that   SEMI   E84
references SEMI E1.9, SEMI E15, SEMI E15.1, SEMI
E47.1, and SEMI E64 which are semiconductor specific
standards and not applicable to FPD. However, none of
the  requirements  in  these  documents  are  prerequisites
for  implementing  SEMI  E84.  SEMI  E84  is  applicable
to FPD and can be implemented independently.
NOTICE:      SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or
representations  as  to  the  suitability  of  the  standard  set
forth    herein    for    any    particular    application.    The
determination of the suitability of the standard is solely
the  responsibility  of  the  user.  Users  are  cautioned  to
refer   to   manufacturer’s   instructions,   product   labels,
product   data   sheets,   and   other   relevant   literature
respecting   any   materials   mentioned   herein.   These
standards are subject to change without notice.
The  user’s  attention  is  called  to  the  possibility  that
compliance   with   this   standard   may   require   use   of
copyrighted  material  or  of  an  invention  covered  by
patent  rights.  By  publication  of  this  standard,  SEMI

SPECIFICATION FOR MECHANICAL INTERFACE BETWEEN FLAT
PANEL DISPLAY MATERIAL HANDLING EQUIPMENT AND TOOL
PORT, USING AUTOMATED GUIDED VEHICLE (AGV), RAIL GUIDED
VEHICLE (RGV), AND MANUAL GUIDED VEHICLE (MGV)
This specification was technically approved by the Global Flat Panel Display Material Handling Committee
and  is  the  direct  responsibility  of  the  Japanese  Flat  Panel  Display  Material  Handling  Committee.  Current
edition  approved  by  the  Japanese  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  3,  2001.    Initially  available  at
<a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> September 2001; to be published November 2001.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  This  specification  defines  a  common  set  of  feature
requirements  on  and  about  tool  ports  of  process  tools
used  in  manufacturing  of  flat  panel  displays.  These
standardized   feature   requirements   are   intended   to
facilitate  the  interfacing  of  AGV,  RGV,  and  MGV
equipment   to   the   process   tool.   Such   standards   are
intended  to  promote  cost-effective  interfacing  while
preserving   freedom   of   choice   in   material   handling
equipment, using AGV, RGV, and MGV.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This  specification  defines  mechanical  features  on

4  Terminology
4. 1  atomic force microscope (AFM) — a device which
precisely   measures   surface   shape   by   gauging   the
reciprocal active force between atoms through use of a
probe.
4. 2  clean  oven  —  a  device  that  heats  a  specimen
through circulation of heated air through an air filter.
4. 3  confocal     scanning     laser     microscope     —     a
microscope which is able to create an image of just the
focal point by concentrating light on a specimen using a
confocal  laser.    This  device  can  also  measure  surface
shape  by  recording  height  information,  which  matches
the focal point of each scans line image.
5  Summary of Method
5. 1  Measure  spectral  transmittance,  chromaticity,  and
surface shape of specimen.
5. 2  Place  specimen  in  heating  device  and  leave  at
specified temperature for specified length of time.
5. 3  Remove  specimen  from  heating  device  and  cool
them.
5. 4  Observe  visually  and  by  microscope  to  see  if  any
exterior changes have occurred in the specimen.
5. 5  Measure  spectral  transmittance,  chromaticity,  and
surface shape of specimen.
6  Apparatus
6. 1  Heating Device and Holders
6. 1.1  Heating   Device   —   Use   a   clean   oven.      The
heating  device  being  used  must  have  the  accuracy  of
temperature  verified.    Also,  the  device  should  have
enough capacity to be able to heat the specimen evenly
to the target temperature promptly.  For example, there
are devices where it is necessary to place a metal block
inside to increase the heating capacity to the specimen.
6. 1.2  Holder — First the holder should be raised to the
specified  temperature  and  then  the  specimen  should  be
set in the holder.</p><p>SEMI D29-1101 © SEMI 20012

DEFINITION OF MEASUREMENT INDEX (SEMU) FOR LUMINANCE
MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION
This  definition  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Flat  Panel  Display  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  Japan  Flat  Panel  Display  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  Japan  Regional
Standards  Committee  on  July  19,  2002.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  October  2002;  to  be  published
November 2002.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  This standard will define the index of measurement
for mura in FPD image quality inspection.</li><li>2    Conventionally,  inspection  of  FPD  image  quality
has been sensory, mainly conducted via the human eye,
and   among   the   items   detected,   there   has   been   no
common   standard   for   mura   and   other   associated
defects.    For  this  reason,  when  panel  makers  and  their
users  who  conduct  business  with  a  fixed  quality  level
set  a  mura  acceptance  level,  limit  samples  are  used  as
necessary.</li><li>3  Operational problems with limit samples include:
• Level   of   mura   cannot   be   determined   without
viewing the sample.  Due to this, it is not possible
to  express  the  level  via  written  documentation  or
telephone.
• The sample settings are subjectively decided by the
setter, and lack objectivity.
• It  is  difficult  to  setup  and  maintain  a  consistent
sample level at multiple locations.</li><li>4  Etc.  —  Above  all,  in  a  market  complicated  by
multiple   panel   makers   and   multiple   users,   where
presently there is no fixed standard for expressing mura
level,  we  have  to  say  that  it  is  extremely  difficult  to
ensure a fixed level for panel quality.</li><li>5    In  this  standard,  using  ergonomics  approach,  we
will  investigate  the  human  eye’s  sensitivity  regarding
mura, and by expressing the relation between mura area
and  contrast,  propose  an  index  to  express  the  level  of
mura.
2  Scope</li><li>1    This  standard  is  applicable  to  FPD  (Flat  Panel
Displays)   excluding   CRT   and   HMD   (Head   Mount
Displays).  The display sizes targeted are typically from
Type  8  (8&quot;  (20.3  cm)  diagonal)  to  Type  30  (30&quot;  (76.2
cm) diagonal).</li><li>2    This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1    In  the  first  edition  of  this  standard,  the  target  of
measurement, mura, is limited as below.</li><li>1.1  Line defects narrower than 300 μm and pixel dot
defects are not the subject of this standard.</li><li>1.2          Mura     background     display     is     limited     to
monochrome   displays/intermediate   gray   scale   level;
RGB,  etc.  color  background  and  L0/L63  background
are not the subject of this standard.

EXPERIMENT OUTLINE FOR CALCULATION OF MEASUREMENT
INDEX FOR LUMINANCE MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION
NOTE:    This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  D31.    This  related  information  was  approved  for
publication by full letter ballot procedures on July 19, 2002.
R1-1  Purpose
R1-1.1    It  has  been  reported  that  under  the  range  of
certain  conditions,  a  basic  expression  of  FPD  mura
quality   level   can   be   made,   using   their   size   and
contrast
<!-- -->[1]<!-- -->
.    Here,  recreating  those  experiments,  we
verified      their      reproducibility,      conducting      the
experiment  with  a  goal  of  calculating  a  measurement
index for luminance mura for standardization.
R1-2  Experiment Method
R1-2.1  Experiment Equipment
R1-2.1.1    The  experiment  utilized  a  14.1  inch,  1024  X
768  pixel  backlit  TFT/LCD.    As  there  was  a  need  to
display low contrast luminance muras, it was reworked
to  display  256  gradations  in  a  43  cd/m
2
~  54  cd/m
2</p><p>range.    A  program  capable  of  displaying  rectangular
and round muras as desired was created, and the muras
were displayed in the center of the prepared LCD.  The
subjects   could   freely   adjust   the   luminance   of   the
displayed  luminance  muras  using  a  handheld  ten-key
pad.
R1-2.2  Experiment Conditions
R1-2.2.1    21  types  of  muras  were  used.    These  were
four round types (diameter:7, 25, 55, 305 pixels) and 17
rectangular  types  (31×1,  153×1,  240×1,  480×1,  31×2,
153×2,  240×2,  31×3,  153×3,  240×3,  31×16,  69×35,
140×17,  240×10,  1×31,  1×153,  1×240).    Observation
conditions  were  a  viewing  distance  of  500  mm,  and
view  angle  normal  to  the  center  of  the  LCD.    The
experiment  room  was  a  darkroom,  and  the  background
luminance of the luminance mura was 48 cd/m
2
.
R1-2.3  Subjects/Experiment Procedure
R1-2.3.1  The   subjects   for the   experiment   were   16
adults,   with   no   eye   disease   and   with   near   vision
strength (50 cm) of 1.2 or greater for both eyes.  Of the
16  subjects,  there  was  an  Expert  group  of  8  (7  male,  1
female,  average  age  40  years),  consisting  of  engineers
from   LCD   makers,   who   regularly   conduct   mura
inspections  and  analysis.    The  remaining  8  subjects  (6
males,   2   females,   average   age   21)   were   college
students,   a   Novice   group   who   were   conducting
luminance mura evaluation for the first time.  Using the
ten-key  pad,  the  subjects  adjusted  the  luminance  of
mura,  to  a  point  “where  mura  can  just  no  longer  be
detected”    (referred    to    as    “jnd”:    just    noticeable
difference  below)  and  to  a  “point  where  mura  can
clearly  be  detected”  (referred  to  as  “distinct”  below),
recording  the  contrasts  at  these  times.    Muras  brighter
than  the  background  and  lighter  than  the  background
were both targeted.
R1-3  Experiment Results
R1-3.1  The  following  matters  became  clear  from  the
experiment.
• The  larger  the  area  of  the  mura,  the  smaller  jnd
contrast  (C  jnd)  became.    (Muras  are  more  visible
as area becomes larger)
• Muras with a width of one pixel, compared to other
muras,  require  nearly  1.5  to  2  times  the  contrast.
(Muras  with  a  width  of  one  pixel  are  difficult  to
detect)
• Comparing  the  distribution  between  the  subjects,
there  was  no  difference  between  the  Expert  and
Novice groups for jnd contrast (C jnd)
• Compared  to  the  Expert  group,  the  Novice  group
had a larger distribution for distinct contrast.
R1-3.2      The   relation   between   mura   area   and   jnd
contrast showed the same trend as in past experience
<!-- -->[1]<!-- -->
,
and   the   quality   of   reproducibility   was   confirmed.
Therefore  at  this  point,  for  the  sake  of  standardization,
we  examined  the  function  for  mura  area,  and  tried
linear  regression  for  it  with  jnd  contrast.    Figure  1
shows  the  results.    When  the  horizontal  axis  is
33. 0
1
S</p><p>(S is mura area in mm
2
units), and the vertical axis is at
contrast,   the   bold   line   shows   a   strong   correlation
coefficient, understood through linear regression.
R1-3.3  This bold line shows the relation between mura
area  and  contrast  at  the  point  where  the  mura  becomes
just not detectable (jnd), and if area is determined, then
jnd contrast (C jnd) can be figured out.  In Figure 1, ○
is  a  mura  with  a  width  of  one  pixel,  and  ●  represents
other    muras    (not    one    pixel    wide)    respectively
representing  the  averages  of  the  16  subjects.    As  noted
above  in  2),  a  mura  with  a  width  of  one  pixel  tends  to
be  slightly  different,  which  is  why  they  were  handled
separately.    Also  considering  past  experiment  results,
when  viewing  distance  is  500mm,  the  0.3mm  level</p><p>SEMI D31-1102 © SEMI 2002 4
seems to be the boundary.  Here we propose Equation 1
which  regressively  analyzes  the  ● in Figure 1 as
criteria for standardization.

R1-3.4  The    criteria for    standardization,    jnd,    is
determined  by  the  C  jnd  straight  line,  but  we  also
propose,  based  on  this  criteria,  quality  levels  for  other
visible muras.  Figure 1 shows straight lines made up of</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>0 jnd  and  3.0  jnd.    ×  is  distinct  contrast  for  the
Expert  group,  but  in  cases  besides  1-pixel  wide  muras,
it can be understood to be distributed slightly above the</li><li>0 jnd straight line.
R1-3.5    This  indicates  that  the  straight-line  relationship
of  Figure  1  is  not  only  jnd  level,  but  also  consists  of
visible  contrast  level.    Accordingly,  with  the  bold  line
jnd as  a  standard,  mura  quality  level  can  be  expressed
by n in n x jnd.  From the experiment results this time,
from  3.0  being  a  level  slightly  above  distinct,  it  can  be
thought  that  it  is  desirable  to  operate  using  a  range  of
levels 1.0 to 3.0.
R1-4  Summary
R1-4.1          A     proposal     was     made     regarding     the
quantization of FPD luminance mura.  The quality level
of a mura can be expressed as a function between mura
area  and  contrast,  using  the  contrast  at  the  jnd  point  as
criteria.    By  using  this  method,  even  if  mura  area,
shape,  or  contrast  is  different,  we  can  now  calculate
similar quality level jnd.

SPECIFICATION FOR IMPROVED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR
GLASS FPD SUBSTRATES THROUGH ORIENTATION CORNER
UNIFICATION
This specification was technically approved by the Global FPD Materials and Components Committee and is
the  direct  responsibility  of  the  Japanese  FPD  Materials  and  Components  Committee.    Current  edition
approved  by  the  Japanese  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  January  10,  2003.    Initially  available  at
<a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> January 2003; to be published March 2003.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1            This      specification      provides      the      location,
dimensions,  and  message  size  of  the  marking  symbol
that  consists  of  a  two-dimensional  code  symbol  and
related alpha numeric characters (capable of being read
visually  through  the  reader  camera  and  display)  and  is
located  outside  of  the  quality  area  of  glass  flat  panel
display (FPD) substrate.</li><li>2  The marking symbol in this specification allows the
inclusion    of    identification    information    for    each
individual    substrate    together    with    the    additional
information  previously  provided  by  various  orientation
corner (OC) cut shapes.</li><li>3    Thus,  this  specification  allows  suppliers  of  glass
substrates  for  FPDs  to  simplify  substrate  information
management   by   marking   such   information   in   one
location   around   the   OC   on   the   substrate,   before
shipping.    In  addition,  use  of  this  marking  symbol  will
facilitate  the  future  elimination  of  the  numerous  types
of OC cut shapes presently in use.</li><li>4    The  marking  symbol  covered  by  this  specification
is intended for use by suppliers and purchasers of glass
substrates for FPDs.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This  specification  provides  for  a  standardized  OC
location  in  support  of  future  unification  of  the  OC  cut
shape  as  well  as  location.    When  this  is  done,  the
provisional nature of the specification can be removed.</li><li>2    This  specification  covers  the  content,  dimensions,
and  surface  positioning  of  the  marking  symbol  located
outside  of  the  quality  area  of  glass  substrates  for  FPD
use.</li><li>2.1  This marking symbol is marked in a manner and
location to avoid affecting the user patterning process.</li><li>2.2    Although  this  specification  does  not  specify  the
marking  technique  to  be  employed  when  complying
with  its  requirements,  it  is  assumed  that  the  marking
symbol  will  be  obtained  by  laser  marking  individual
dots.</li><li>3  Marking symbols are applicable across all stages of
FPD   processing,   from   virgin   substrates   to   fully
patterned  substrates.    The  format  and  algorithm  for  the
Data    Matrix    code    is    based    on    two-dimensional
symbology specified in ISO/IEC 16022.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1    Since  the  symbol  is  marked  in  a  region  of  the
substrate  outside  of  the  quality  area,  it  is  not  available
for use after this area is cut off.</li><li>2    Since  only  a  single  symbol  is  marked  on  each
substrate, the marking symbol is not directly applicable
for  management  of  individual  panels  in  multi-panel
displays.

5. 2.2  character   separation,   vertical   —   the   vertical
distance  between  the  adjacent  boundaries  of  any  two
adjacent characters.
5. 2.3  character   spacing   —   the   horizontal   distance
between   the   character   centerlines   of   two   adjacent
characters.
5. 3    Definitions  of  terms  relating  to  the  marking  area
are as follows:
5. 3.1  mark  area  —  a  rectangular  area  containing  the
mark field(s) and the surrounding quiet zone.
5. 3.2  mark field — an area within which all mark dots
occur.
5. 3.3  quiet zone — an unpatterned, unmarked area that
surrounds a mark field.
5. 3.4  TIR  —  total  indicator  reading,  the  difference
between the maximum and minimum distances of a line
from a reference line.
6  Ordering Information
6. 1  Content information of mark, as agreed to between
purchaser and supplier
6. 2    Number  of  message  characters  (up  to  a  maximum
of   20,   see   Section   7.7.1),   as   agreed   to   between
purchaser and supplier.
7  Requirements
7. 1  Orientation  Corner  —  The  OC  location  shall  be
the  lower  left  corner  of  the  substrate  with  the  pattern
surface  up  and  the  long  edge  at  the  bottom.    Since  the
necessary  information  is  encoded  in  the  identification
marks,  it  is  not  necessary  to  distinguish  the  shapes  of
the other corners of the substrate.  OC cut shape is not
specified at this time, but it is expected that in the future
a   single   shape   will   be   established   for   the   next
generation of substrates.
7. 2  Shape, Size, and Location of Marking Symbols
7. 2.1    The  location  of  the  mark  field  relative  to  the
orientation  corner  and  the  adjacent  edges  of  the  sub-
strate  shall  be  as  shown  in  Figure  1.    The  reference
point  of  the  two-dimensional  code  symbol,  together
with  a  parallelism  requirement,  locates  the  entire  mark
field.
7. 2.2      The   mark   field   dimensions   and   the   symbols
within the mark field shall be as shown in Figure 2.
7. 2.3    Overall  mark  area  dimensions  shall  be  as  shown
in Figure 3.
7. 2.4  The values of the dimensions shall be as defined
in Tables 1 and 2.
7. 3  Data Matrix Code Symbol Dimensions
7. 3.1    Each  rectangular  Data  Matrix  code  symbol  shall
be composed of an array of 18 rows and 18 columns, as
shown schematically in Figure 4.
7. 3.2  Cell spacing shall be 80 μm, center to center.
7. 3.3        The    Data    Matrix    code    symbol    shall    be

defined in Table 3 is recommended.
7. 4.2      Characters   shall   be   marked   in   a   dot   matrix
format,  contained  within  a  character  window  0.72  mm
high × 0.40 mm high.
7. 4.3    Character  window  separation  shall  be  0.24  mm
horizontally and 0.16 mm vertically.
7. 5  Reference  Point  for  all  symbols  shall  be  the  center
point of the cell common to the primary border row and
primary   border   column   of   the   Data   Matrix   code
symbol.
7. 6  Mark Field Dimensions shall be in accordance with
the  dimensions  D  and  F given  in  Table  2.    Parallelism
(T)  of  the  top  of  the  mark  field  within  dimension  L,
relative to the nearest edge, shall be ≤ 1.0 mm TIR.
7. 7  Message Characters
7. 7.1  Up to 20 alphanumeric characters in the character
set  listed  in  Table  3  shall  be  encoded  in  the  two-
dimensional code symbol, and alphanumeric characters
with  the  same  content  shall  be  placed  symmetrically
around  the  two-dimensional  code  symbol  as  shown  in
Figure  2.    The  message  content  is  not  defined,  but  it
does  not  include  any  check  sum  characters.    It  may
include  information  provided  by  the  glass  substrate
supplier,  and  the  remainder  of  the  message  characters,
if  any,  can  be  used  to  insert  information  agreed  on
between   supplier   and   purchaser.      If   the   message
contains  less  than  20  characters,  a  dash  (–)  may  be
inserted  for  the  unused  characters,  at  the  supplier’s
discretion.
7. 7.2    The  Data  Matrix  code  symbol  shall  be  encoded
with   error   checking   and   correcting   characters   in
accordance  with  ECC 200  in  accordance  with  ISO/IEC</p><h1>16022</h1><ol start="16022"><li></li><li>7.3  Alphanumeric characters shall:</li><li>7.3.1    Be  positioned  such  that  their  lower  part  faces
toward the nearest edge of the glass substrate.</li><li>7.3.2    Contain  message  characters  identical  to  those
encoded in the Data Matrix code field.</li></ol><p>SEMI D32-0303 © SEMI 2003 3
7. 7.3.3  Consist of two sets of two-line strings as shown
in Figure 2.
7. 7.4  The order of the alphanumeric characters shall be
as agreed upon between supplier and user.
NOTE  1:    A  typical  sequence  could  be:  The  message  begins
at  the  upper  leftmost  window,  progresses  horizontally  to  the
upper  rightmost  window,  continues  at  the  lower  leftmost
window and ends at the lower rightmost window.
7. 8  Quiet Zones
7. 8.1  The space between the Data Matrix code symbol
and adjacent alphanumeric symbols shall be 0.48 mm.
7. 8.2    A  0.50  mm  wide  quiet  zone  surrounds  the  entire
mark field.

MEASURING METHOD OF OPTICAL CHARACTERISTICS FOR
BACKLIGHT UNIT
This  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Flat  Panel  Display  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  Japanese  FPD  Materials  and  Components  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the
Japanese Regional Standards Committee on April 28, 2003.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> May 2003;
to be published July 2003.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  The electro optical characteristics of backlight unit
(BLU)  have  a  great  influence  on  the  characteristics  of
LCD  like  uniformity,  luminance  and  chromaticity  etc.
There  are  many  measurement  methods  for  BLU  of
electro optical characteristics.  It is so different that the
measurement  method  for  BLU  in  each  company  (e.g.:
the  testing  position,  test  condition,  equipment  concept
etc.).  Therefore,  this  standard  will  present  the  general
measurement method.
2  Scope</li><li>1    This  standard  is  applicable  to  BLU  for  Liquid
Crystal  Display  (LCD)  and  the  measurement  includes
only   the   optical   area.   The   other   areas   (Electric
characteristics,  Reliability,  and  so  forth)  are  dealt  with
by other SEMI standards.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  This standard does not include the test of each BLU
component such as: light guide panel, optical film, Cold
Cathode       Fluorescent       Lamp       (CCFL),       film
characteristics, and etc.

6. 2.3  Measuring Equipment
6. 2.3.1  Instrument for Driving of BLU
6. 2.3.1.1  In this standard a DC power supply is needed
and  an  inverter  for  BLU  driving  of  electro-optical  test.
It is required that the DC-power supply has the range of
the output voltage between 0 to 30V and has the range
of the output current between 0 to 8A.
6. 2.3.2  Instrument For Optical Measurement
6. 2.3.2.1    In  this  standard,  spectroradiometer  is  needed
for  optical  test.    Spectroradiometer  is  more  adequate
than  a  filter  photometer  for  BLU  color  measurement
and  it  can  use  filter  photometer  and  spectroradiometer
for luminance measurement.
6. 2.4  Warm-Up Time
6. 2.4.1    Warm-up  time  is  the  period  from  power-on  to
saturation    of    the    light    intensity.        The    optical
measurement   needs   15   to   30   minutes   for   a   more
accurate   measurement   in   case   of   luminance   and
luminance uniformity.</p><p>Figure 2
The Warm-Up Time of BLU</p><ol start="6"><li>2.5  Others</li><li>2.5.1    It  is  recommended  that  the  user  record  the
environment   and   condition   such   as:   temperature,
humidity,  illumination  of  surrounding,  testing  distance,
warm-up time, lamp current, etc.</li><li>3  Measurement Items</li><li>3.1            The      following      measurement      items      are
recommended for BLU, but these items depend on user
requirements if they are specified.</li><li>3.2  Luminance</li><li>3.2.1  It is the surface luminance that is detected in all
test  areas.    Luminance  should  be  expressed  in  a  unit
such  as  candelas  per  meter  squared  <!-- -->[cd/m
2
]<!-- -->.    This
luminance  is  the  value  measured at one center point or
average  value  at  several  testing  points.  Generally,  the
lamp  current  of  BLU  should  be  set  to  typical  lamp
current.  If the lamp current value has fluctuation state,
the user should wait by stable state.  The measurements
are   performed   in   the   dark   room   under   standard
measuring conditions and design viewing direction.</li><li>3.3  Luminance Uniformity</li><li>3.3.1  Luminance uniformity is a measure of how well
the  luminance  remains  constant  over  the  surface  of  the

luminance  itself.    Backlights  are  particularly  liable  to
have the non-uniformity characteristics.  The measuring
method  is  similar  to  the  luminance  measuring  method.
In  this  measurement,  it  is  important  to  determine  the
testing   position.   The   determination   of   the   testing
position  occur  some  different  testing  result.    In  this
standard,  we  calculate  the  uniformity  with  the  ratio  of
max  luminance  and  min  luminance  level.  The  simple
formulas   are   below.   There   are   two   formulas   for
uniformity.  These formulas explain the non-uniformity
concept, but they very popular with related industry.</li></ol><p>Measuring position in luminance uniformity formula:</p><p>100)((%)

6  Apparatus
6. 1  Electrical    Apparatus    —    Choose    measuring
equipment   to   use   from   the   following   devices   and
specify  which  devices  were  used,  and  also  specify  a
measuring    circuit,    lighting    frequency,    rating    of
electrical   wire   and   its   length   in   the   report.      The
electrical  (and  optical)  characteristics  of  CCFL  depend
on the frequency of the lighting circuit.
6. 1.1  Power Supply — For the lighting of CCFL, use a
power    supply    unit    that    provides    the    substantial
sinusoidal  waveform  and  frequency  of  50–60  kHz.
Also,  use  the  combination  of  a  Stabilized  DC  power
supply  unit  and  an  inverter,  or  a  power  supply  unit
designed   specially   as   an   integrated   type   (special
purpose).   The   output   voltage   of   either   of   them   is
variable   but   the   variability   shall   not   affect   the
measurement.
6. 1.2  Meter  —  Use  a  meter  that  indicates  true  AC
voltage  values  for  measurement.  The  meter  built  in  a
special  purpose  power  supply  unit  shall  indicate  true
values as well.
6. 1.3  Circuit   —   The   circuit   to   measure   electrical
characteristics shall conform to Figure 1 or Figure 2.
6. 1.4  Specify the ratings and lengths of electrical wires
that  connect  each  meter  and  lamp.    Since  the  wires
produce  leakage  current  due  to  stray  capacitance  and
the  amount  differs  according  to  the  lengths,  set  the
wires as short as possible and do not bundle them.
6. 2  Optical    Measuring    Equipment    —    Choose    a
measuring equipment to use from the following devices
and  specify  which  devices  were  used,  and  also  specify
the  measuring  distance,  viewing  angle,  and  ambient
temperature  in  the  report.  The  optical  (and  electrical)
characteristics  of  CCFL  depend  on  the  ambient  (lamp
wall) temperature.
6. 2.1  Black  Box  for  Measurement  —  The  black  box
used  to  measure  shall  be  so  designed  that  the  lamp
surface  may  not  be  affected  by  wind.  The  delustered
black paint shall be applied on the inside of the box so
that  it  may  not  be  affected  by  the  background  color  or
reflected  light  when  the  luminance  is  measured.  In
addition,   in   order   not   to   be   affected   by   stray
capacitance,  non-conductive  materials  shall  be  used.
For  the  installation  of  a  CCFL  in  the  box,  a  fixing
method  shall  be  employed  for  avoiding  the  impact  to
the lamp wall temperature distribution at lighting.

6. 2.2  Meter — Use a spectroradiometer or colorimeter
to  measure  the  luminance  and  chromaticity.  Keep  the
spectroradiometer  under  control  of  calibration  system
with  the  meter  of  national  standard  and  traceability.
Calibrate  the  colorimeter  in  such  a  way  that  it  can
reproduce   the   luminance   value   of   a   master   CCFL
obtained  by  a  calibrated  spectroradiometer.  Since  each
colorimeter has the instrumental error and changes with
the  passage  of  time,  the  calibration  is  necessary  for
daily  use.  For  the  calibration,  a  master  CCFL,  which
has  the  emission  spectrum  value  close  to  that  of  a
CCFL to be measured, shall be used.
6. 2.3  Diagram  for  Measurement  —  The  diagram  for
optical measurement shall conform to Figure 3.
7  Measurement Conditions
7. 1  The   place   for   measurement   shall   be   kept   at
25 ± 2°C for ambient temperature and 30–85%RH.  The
temperature  fluctuation  shall  be  within  1°C  and  if  the
temperature   is   specified,   the   measurement   shall   be
carried out at such temperature. There shall be no wind
or vibration that may affect the measurement.
7. 2  For     the     measurement     of     luminance     and
chromaticity,   arrange   the   situation   where   ambient
reflected light may not affect it or such can be ignored.
7. 3  For   the   measurement   of   voltage,   points   to   be
measured   shall   be   specified   in   circuit   diagrams.
Measured  values  may  vary  by  the  impact  of  ballast
capacitor   or   probe   based   upon   whether   the   points
measured  are  located  at  an  inverter  transformer  side  or
a  lamp  side  (or  located  at  front  or  rear  side  of  ballast
capacitor).
7. 4  The  electrostatic  capacity  of  a  high  voltage  probe
used  to  measure  a  voltage  shall  be  so  small  that  the
impact to the probe by leakage current may be less and
it shall be specified.
8  Test Specimen
8. 1  Use  a  CCFL  in  which  the  wall  temperature  and
ambient  temperature  are  kept  in  equilibrium  before
lighting.    Especially    when    measuring    the    stable
discharge  voltage  again  after  the  first  measurement,
carry out after the lamp has been in equilibrium on both
temperatures,  the  lamp  wall  temperature  and  ambient
temperature.
8. 2  Fix a CCFL horizontally along its long side on the
jig  of  the  above-mentioned  equipment  and  this  method
shall not affect the temperature distribution on the wall.
The measured point shall be measured in the air.</p><p>SEMI D35-1103

9. 1  Measurement of Electrical Characteristics
9. 1.1  Measurement  of  Stable  Discharge  Voltage  —
Apply  zero  or  very  low  voltage  to  the  both  ends  of  a
lamp (between two electrodes) and increase the voltage
gradually  (slide-up).  The  lamp  starts  to  discharge  after
the   voltage   reaches   a   certain   value.      Furthermore,
increase  the  voltage  gradually  (slide-up)  and  measure
the    potential    difference    between    the    lamp    ends
(electrodes)  as  a  stable  discharge  voltage  when  a  main
discharge starts.
9. 1.2  Measurement  of  Lamp  Current  —  Adjust  the
output voltage of power supply unit to gain a specified
lamp   current.   Measure   the   lamp   current   at   GND
terminal  when  it  becomes  stable  at  a  specified  value.
Record  the  preset  voltage  of  the  power  supply  as  well.
(Refer to Figure 1 or Figure 2.)
9. 1.3  Measurement  of  Lamp  Voltage  —  Measure  the
potential difference between both ends (electrodes) of a
lamp as a lamp voltage when the lamp current becomes
stable at a specified lamp current.  If the lamp current is
affected  when  a  probe  is  connected,  adjust  the  lamp
current  to  make  it  a  specified  lamp  current.    Measure
the lamp current after it becomes stable.
9. 1.4  Lamp  Wattage  —  It  is  defined  as  a  product  of
lamp    current,    lamp    voltage    and    power    factor
(W = VL × IL × cosθ)   and   expressed   as   a   reference
value.  When  the  phase  difference  between  the  lamp
current  and  lamp  voltage  can  be  ignored  and  if  such
situation  is  specified,  the  product  of  the  lamp  current
and lamp voltage (W = VL × IL) may be expressed as a
reference value.
9. 2  Measurement of Optical Characteristics
9. 2.1  Point  of  Measurement  —  The  point  is  the  side
surface of a lamp, which is within the range of viewing
angle (black circle) of a measuring instrument. The area
of  measurement  is  the  central  part  of  the  lamp.  The
point of measurement shall be so small relatively to the
inner  diameter  of  the  lamp  that  the  dislocation  of  the
point  may  not  vary  the  luminance  and  chromaticity.
The point of measurement is a cylindrical surface but it
could   be   regarded   as   a   plain   surface   due   to   the
smallness.    (See  Figure  5.)  The  dispersion  due  to
dislocation of a point of measurement is smaller within
the  range  that  is  less  than  or  equal  to  50%  of  the  inner
diameter. The luminance decreases in the other range.
9. 2.2  Distance  of  Measurement  —  The  distance  shall
be  from  a  lamp  surface  to  be  measured  to  a  light-
receiving  lens  surface  of  a  measuring  instrument.  The
size of viewing angle varies according to adjustment by
luminance  meter  and  the  distance  of  measurement,  set
the  distance  to  match  the  inner  diameter  mentioned
above.  When  measuring,  the  inner  surface  of  the  lamp
and the focal point shall be well matched (Figure 5). (If
the focal point of the luminance meter is displaced, the
luminance and chromaticity values will not be indicated
correctly.)
9. 2.3  Timing  of  Measurement  —  Measure  after  the
luminance  seems  stable  at  a  specified  lamp  current
(where  the  luminance  fluctuation  difference  is  within
± 3% of the stable luminance, for example). (See Figure
4. )</p><p>SEMI D35-1103

S</p><p>Figure 4
Measuring Time of Optical Characteristics</p><p>Commentary  on  Figure  4:  The  CCFL  luminance  has  a  special  rising  property.    The  highest  luminance  and  stable
luminance vary by the combination of ambient temperature and lamp current and the transitions vary as well. This is
based upon the fact that the CCFL luminance depends on temperature and the generated heat by lighting affects it.
For this reason, the luminance varies until the lamp wall temperature becomes stable. Before the measurement, grasp
the special rising property of luminance and set the timing of measurement of the stable luminance.
9. 2.4  Measurement of Luminance — Set a spectroradiometer or a colorimeter vertical to a side to be measured and
measure  according  to  the  above-mentioned  instruction  of  measurement.  Avoid  shades  of  mercury  particles  in  the
lamp. (See Figure 5.)

RELATED INFORMATION 1
STARTING VOLTAGE OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP
(CCFL)
NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI D35 and was derived from Japan Backlight TF.
R1-1  Phenomenon of CCFL Discharge
Starting
R1-1.1  Although  the  phenomenon  of  CCFL  discharge
starting shows the similarity to that of low gas pressure
discharge  starting,  a  high  frequency  lighting  circuit
(inverter)  with  approximately  30–100  kHz  is  mostly
used   to   discharge   and   so   it   is   affected   by   stray
capacitance.
R1-1.2  When   the   secondary   voltage   of   inverter   is
stepping  up  from  a  sufficiently  low  voltage  gradually,
an  emission  area  appears  near  the  electrode  connected
to  higher  voltage  side.    (See  Figure  R1-1  1
st
Phase).
This   means   that   the   discharge   starts   between   the
electrode and ground level of discharge circuit through
the  stray  capacitance,  and  a  spark  after  dark  current
takes  place  in  the  discharge  space  in  the  tube.    In  the
discharge, the other electrode is the tube wall (glass or
fluorescent   substance);   the   formation   of   dielectric
barrier  discharge  and  the  existence  of  the  secondary
electron  supply  system  to  the  discharge  space  can  be
considered  and  thus  the  discharge  seems  sustainable.
Therefore,  the  emission  around  the  electrode  is  judged
to  be  the  emission  mainly  by  negative  glow  of  glow
discharge.
R1-2  From Discharge Starting to Stable
Lighting Mode
R1-2.1  After   the   discharge   takes   place   near   the
electrode  and  the  secondary  voltage  of  the  inverter
increases   gradually,   the   emission   area   near   the
electrode  grows  longer  accordingly.    (See  Figure  R1-
2. )  This means that a positive column is generated by
applied voltage to have such the length as corresponds
to the value of resistance based on the applied voltage.
When  the  voltage  is  applied  furthermore,  the  emission
area  (i.e.  positive  column)  between  two  electrodes  is
generated   finally.      (See   Figure   R1-3   2
nd
Phase.)
However,  if  the  tube  is  thin  and  long  and  the  stray
capacitance is relatively greater to the discharge circuit,
the   ratio   of   current   that   flows   through   the   stray
capacitance  is  still  large  at  this  phase.    With  the
increase  of  the  inverter  secondary  voltage,  the  ratio  of
current that flows in the tube also increases and most of
the current flows in the tube because the impedance of
discharge   path   decreases   on   the   contrary   due   to
negative characteristics of discharge.  (See Figure R1-4
3
rd
Phase.)
R1-2.2  Each voltage applied at these three phases may
be  called  starting  voltage  at  the  first  phase,  or  stable
discharge voltage or tube current at the third phase, for
example.  Sometimes it could be hard to distinguish the
second  phase  from  the  third  phase.    In  addition,  since
the second phase is hardly observed by the tube designs
(for the tube length, outer and inner diameters of tube,
pressure  and  composition  of  filler  gas,  and  peripheral
members of tube), it looks as if the first phase shifted to
the  third  phase  suddenly.    This  is  because  the  stray
capacitance  is  so  big  that  the  current  cannot  flow  into
the  tube,  the  discharge  surges  immediately  after  the
current  flows  into  the  tube,  the  impedance  of  the
discharge    path    decreases    due    to    the    negative
characteristics  and  a  large  amount  of  current  flows  in
the tube all of a sudden.
R1-2.3  From the viewpoint of discharge phenomenon,
the  voltages  applied  to  the  tube  at  the  first  and  third
phases are important.  Especially the voltage applied at
the  third  phase  should  be  noted  practically.    (The
voltage applied at the second phase may be noted also.)
R1-3  Cautions at Discharge Starting
R1-3.1  At   the   discharge   starting,   α   coefficient   of
discharge   gas   and   γ   coefficient   of   electrode   are
involved.    These  coefficients  contain  the  pressure  of
discharge   gas   (particle   density)   as   a   parameter.
Especially when the mercury is filled in, the control of
ambient  temperature  becomes  very  important  because
the  mercury  vapor  (particle  density)  pressure  changes
sensitively to the ambient temperature.
R1-3.2  In  addition,  the  lighting  circuit  is  usually  built
for AC, the reduction of unnecessary stray capacitance
base on frequency shall be required.  As the impact of
stray  capacitance  becomes  greater  especially  when  the
tube  is  thin  and  long,  sufficient  consideration  shall  be
given.</p><p>SEMI D35-1103
