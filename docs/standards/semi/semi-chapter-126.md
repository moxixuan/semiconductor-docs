SEMI G52-90 © SEMI 1990, 20041 SEMI G52-90 (Reapproved 1104)STANDARD TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF IONICCONTAMINATION ON SEMICONDUCTOR LEADFRAMES (PROPOSED) This test method was technically approved by the Global Assembly & Packaging Committee and is the directresponsibility of the Japanese Packaging Committee. Current edition approved by the Japanese RegionalStandards Committee on July 23, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to be publishedNovember 2004. Originally published in 1990.NOTE 1: Japan, Europe, and US task forces are planning todevelop test methods which will address the different levelsof ionic contamination on leadframes. 1 Scope1.1 This standard describes the procedure to determineionic contamination on leadframes using a waterextraction method. The method is sensitive to Na+ ,NH 4+ , K +, Cl, NO 3- , Br, SO 42, PO 43.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 2 Referenced Standards2.1 ASTM Specifications1 D 1193  Specification for Reagent WaterD 4327  Anions in Water by Ion ChromatographyNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 3 Summary of Method3.1 Ionic contamination is extracted in water at &gt; 95°Cfor 30 ± 2 minutes. The contamination is quantitativelyanalyzed by ion type using Ion Chromatography and theresult is presented as nanograms/unit area. 4 Significance4.1 Contamination on leadframes can contribute tosemiconductor device reliability problems. This methodmay be used by lead frame manufacturers at outgoinginspection and by users at incoming inspection.Correlation of device reliability with contaminationlevels may lead to improved leadframe cleaningprocesses. 1 American Society for Testing and Materials, 100 Barr HarborDrive, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-2959, USA.Telephone: 610.832.9585, Fax: 610.832.9555, Website:www.astm.org 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 eluent  the solvent used to carry the extractedions through the ion exchange chromatograph.5.1.2 regenerant  a chemical solution containing theions originally present in the chromatograph columnprior to a test run and used to prepare the column for anew test.5.1.3 retention time  the time required for aparticular ion type to pass from the injection port to thedetector. Retention time is characteristically differentfor each ion type.5.1.4 standard solution  a solution containing aknown concentration of the ion to be measured andused to calibrate the chromatograph. 6 Equipment6.1 Ion Chromatograph for Anion and Cation Analysis This equipment is to consist of a concentrationpump, guard column, separator column, and a detectormodule consisting of a suppressor device to reduce thebackground eluent conductivity to a low level and aconductivity cell. The minimum sensitivity of thechromatograph for each ion type is defined in Table 1.6.2 Chart Recorder6.3 Ion Extraction Vessels  Polypropylene or tefloncontainers with sealing caps, or polypropylene/polyethylene double layered bags.NOTE 2: The contamination level of these vessels must beless than one-fifth (1/5) of the expected contamination levelon the leadframes when measured in a control test.6.4 Hot Bar Bag Sealer6.5 Water Bath  300 mmL  300 mmW  200 mmH,filled with DI water, and capable of holding 95°C.6.6 Volumetric Dispenser (e.g., Pipettes)  10 ml and100 ml capacity.6.7 Quartz Flasks and Pipettes for Cation StandardSolutions  100, 250, 500, and 1000 ml capacity(flasks); 1, 10, and 25 ml capacity (pipettes).

Therecommended sample sizes are 1050 cm2 for testingpads and 200500 cm for the test of overall leadframes.NOTE 4: The surface area of the frame is calculated from theleadframe drawing, and includes the top, bottom and sidesurfaces. It is important that user and supplier agree on thesurface area calculation for any given leadframeconfiguration. 9 Preparation of Standard  Solutions andChromatograph Calibration9.1 Standard Solutions9.1.1 The single-ingredient standard solutions of eachion (Na+ , NH 4+ , K + ; C1, No 3- , Br - , SO 42, PO 43) aremade by dissolving 1.000 g of each ion into 1.000 literof D.I. water, respectively. The stored multi-ingredientstandard solutions shown in Table 2 are then made formthese single-ingredient standard solutions by thedilution method.9.1.2 Cation and anion standard solutions forcalibration are made by diluting the stored multi-ingredient standard solutions as shown in Table 2. 9.1.3 Store the multi-ingredient standard solution andthe calibration solutions in the correct flasks and labelwith the ion type and concentration.NOTE 5: New standard solutions for calibration are requiredevery 24 hours. Ensure that the flasks are cleaned with waterbefore refilling with a new solution.9.2 Calibration9.2.1 Set up the chromatograph and regenerate thecolumns according to the manufacturers instructions(ASTM D 4327 provides further details).9.2.2 Run the eluent through the chromatograph until astable baseline chromatograph is obtained.9.2.3 Select the infection volume recommended by themanufacturer for each ion type and inject in to thechromatograph. Record the chromatograph for each iontype (see Figure 1), and make the calibration curve foreach ion (ion concentration versus peak height or area).NOTE 6: Peak height or area under the ions characteristiccurve is proportional to the concentration. 10 Procedure  Bag Extraction Method10.1 Preparation of Extraction Bags10.1.1 Add 100 ml of DI water to thepolypropylene/polyethylene double layered bag andseal them with the hot bar bag sealer. The amount of airin the bags should be reduced as much as possiblebefore sealing.NOTE 7: Two bags are required for each test and must comefrom the same manufacturing lot.10.1.2 Place the bags in the water bath at T &gt; 95°C for2 hours ± 5 minutes.10.1.3 Allow the bags to reach room temperature butleave sealed until ready for use at which time open thebags (use clean scissors for the bags) and rinse out five(5) times with DI water.10.2 Extraction Process10.2.1 Place the samples in the bags. Cover the frameswith a known volume of water (e.g., 100 ml and thenseal the bags). Also, place a similar amount of water inan empty bag and seal.NOTE 8: The amount of air in the bags should be reduced asmuch as possible before sealing. The bags that only containwater provide the background contamination of the bag. Donot select the frames or remove them from their shippingcontainer until ready to test the surface contamination. Therecommended volume of water is 1030 ml for the testing diepads only and 100 ml for testing complete leadframes. Leadframes should be bent after sealing so that the water is incontact with all surfaces.

SEMI G52-90 © SEMI 1990, 20043 10.2.2 Place the bags in the water bath at T &gt; 95°C for30 ± 2 minutes.10.2.3 Remove the bags from the bath and allow toreach room temperature.10.2.4 The lead frames, which are inside the sealedbags, are moved to one side of the bags withoutopening the bags. Then the solution is separated fromleadframes by sealing the mean portion of the bagswithout opening. 11 Procedure  Container Extraction MethodNOTE 9: The size of the containers to be used depends onthe expected volume of water and the leadframes. Thecontainer must be at least three-quarters filled with the waterand leadframes.11.1 Preparation of Extraction Vessels11.1.1 Fill the containers with DI water and attach thecaps. In order to reduce the amount of air in the vessel,fill vessels to the amount of three-quarter.NOTE 10: Two containers are required for each test and mustcome from the same manufacturing batch.11.1.2 Place the containers in the water bath at T &gt;95°C for 2 hours ± 5 minutes.11.1.3 Remove the containers from the bath and rinseout five (5) times with DI water.11.2 Process11.2.1 Place the samples in one of the containerscleaned per Section 11.1.1.NOTE 11: Leadframes may be cut or rolled in order to easeloading to the container. Die pads may be tested separately, ifdesired, by cutting from the leadframes.11.2.1.1 Add the required volume of DI water and capthe container. Place a similar amount of water into theother cleaned container and attach the cap.NOTE 12: Do not select the frames or remove them fromtheir shipping container until ready to test for the surfacecontamination. Recommended volumes of water are 1030 mlfor testing die pads only and 100 ml for the entire leadframe samples must be covered by water.11.2.2 Place the containers in the water bath at T &gt;95°C for 30 ± 2 minutes.11.2.3 Remove the containers from the bath and allowto reach room temperature.11.2.4 Remove the leadframes from the container andcap it again. 12 Measurements12.1 Prepare the chromatograph for operation byregenerating the columns according to themanufacturers recommendations.12.2 Run the eluent through the chromatograph until astable baseline calibration is established.12.3 Inject the recommended sample size of testsolution into the chromatograph and record the ionchromatogram.12.4 Repeat for all the samples and also run thebackground sample.NOTE 13: The time from extraction to insertion of sample isto be within eight hours.12.5 Sample concentrations are determined from thecalibration curves for each ion type.12.6 The surface concentration of ionic contaminantsfor each ion type (SCIC) is given by the followingequation: SCIC (ng/cm2 ) = (Sample conc.

Packages (SOIC  Gull Wingand J lead)Plastic TAB Quad Packages (PTAB)NOTE 1: Package outlines registered with other organizationssuch as EIAJ and non-registered outlines may use the criteriain this document by choosing the outline which most closelyresembles the particular package.Packaging engineers, mold manufactures, and end-of-line tool makers may use this document to define thelimits of tooling tolerances. 2 Applicable Documents2.1 Order of Precedence  To av oid conflicts, theorder of precedence when ordering tooling shall be asfollows:Purchase OrderReferenced DocumentsThis Specification 2.2 Reference Documents2.2.1 SEMI SpecificationsSEMI G48  Specification, Measurement Method forMolded Plastic Package Tooling2.2.2 JEDEC Specifications1 Pub. No. 95  Registered and Standards Outline forSemiconductor Devices2.3 Related Documents for Inform ation2.3.1 Military Specifications2 MIL-STD-100  Engineering Drawing Practice2.3.2 ANSI Specifications3 1 JEDEC, 2001 Eye Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 200062 Military Standards, Naval Publications and Form Center, 5801Tabor Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19120 Y14.5  Dimensioning and Tolerancing 3 Selected Definitions3.1 Cavity  the plastic body form ed by either the topor bottom mold cavities.3.2 Gate Feature  plastic protru sions or intrusionswhich result from normal molding and degatingoperations.3.3 Lead Bend Angle  the angle to which the leadsare bent in reference to a plane normal to the X-Y planeof the package. After a suitable radius has been formedat the shoulder, there must be no compound angleformation to achieve the lead spread requirements. LeadBend Angle may just be a reference if Lead Spread isspecified (see Figures 1A, B, C).3.4 Lead Coplanarity  the vertic al position of a leadfoot with respect to a reference plane created by thethree leads with feet most extended from the bottomsurface of the package body. The term foot applies toboth PLCC foot radii and PQFP feet (see Figure 2).3.5 Lead Shoulder (Dambar Area) Protrusions orIntrusions  a protrusion (tab) on the shoulder or lead,or intrusion cut into the shoulder or lead as a result ofdambar trimming (see Figures 3 and 4).3.6 Lead Sweep  lead movemen t measured withrespect to a datum, perpendicular to the top or bottomsurface of the package and which passes through themidpoint of the lead, when viewed from the sides of thepackage (see Figure 4).3.7 Mismatch  misalignment be tween the top andbottom cavities. The measurement of mismatch is statedas the difference between the center lines of the top andbottom cavities (see Figure 5). All statements regardingmismatch of cavities are applicable to both the X and Yaxis. All measurements are made prior to lead trim andform.3.8 Offset  the difference in the bottom cavityposition from a leadframe datum when compared todesign (see Figure 6). This measurement ignoresleadframe tolerances. All statements regarding offsetare applicable to both the X and Y axis. Allmeasurements are made prior to lead trim and form. 3 American National Standards Institute, 1430 Broadway, New York,NY 10018

Surface roughness affects thewettability of resinous die attach processes onleadframes. If the surface is too smooth, poor wettingmay occur which results in low die share strengthvalues.4.2 Brightness variations may also affect the ability ofthe pattern recognition systems used on assemblyequipment to recognize the set points.5 Summary of Method5.1 The method is based on the use of a GAMDensitometer. This method is chosen as the standardbecause of the small measurement area requirementsand the high accuracy of the method for typical silverplating brightness used on leadframes.5.1.1 This method is based on the measurement of thereflectance of light at 45° from a surface illuminatedfrom a light source perpendicular to the surface. Thisvalue of Reflectance (R) gives a Density Value (D)based on the following formula:D = log 1/RDensity is a measure of the Brightness. 6 Interferences6.1 Surface Finish6.1.1 Brightness values depend on surface roughness.A rough surface shows a low brightness value whencompared to a smooth surface. Variable platingconditions, such as the addition of brighteners to theplating solution, may give brightness results, which arenot comparable for the acceptance of plated leadframes.6.1.2 Scratches and other flaws in the surface willaffect reflectance.6.2 Storage Time and Conditions6.2.1 Figure 1 shows the brightness results forleadframes subjected to indoor, atmospheric storage for

In leadframes, the metal burr, due tothe stamping operation, may be in the horizontal orvertical direction to the surface. In ceramic packages,this type of characteristic is called a fin.3.3 camber (ceramic)  arching o f a nominally flatceramic body.3.4 chip  region of material mis sing from acomponent (e.g., ceramic from a package, or solderfrom a preform). The region does not progresscompletely through the component and is formed afterthe component is manufactured. Chip size is defined byits length, width and depth from a projection of thedesign planform. Also called chipout. (See Figure 1.)3.5 crack  a cleavage or fracture that extends to thesurface of a semiconductor package or solder preform.The crack may or may not pass through the entirethickness of the package or preform.3.6 critical seal area  on a semi conductor package,the area bounded by the shortest nominal designdistance from the largest cavity, usually the wire bondcavity, to the edge of the package or ceramic layerforming the seal area.
