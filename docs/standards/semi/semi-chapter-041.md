SEMI E54.6-0997 © SEMI 1997, 20047 attributes that exceed the network variable size limit of31 bytes.6.7.1 Object Models  The LonTalk Protocol providesan object-oriented specification for defining andaddressing network variables and configurationproperties, which are the representation of objectattributes and events. The device shall comply with theobject model specifications defined in Section 7 of thisdocument.6.7.2 LonMark Object Structure  The LonMarkApplication Layer Interoperability Guidelines define anumber of object types. Each object type has a set ofmandatory network variables, a set of optional networkvariables, a set of configuration properties (bothmandatory and optional), and a manufacturer-definedsection, which may be used for non-interoperableextensions to the object. This is illustrated in Figure 4.This notation is defined in the LonMark ApplicationLayer Interoperability Guidelines. Object Name andNumberMandatory NetworkVariablesOptional NetworkVariablesConfigurationProperties Input NetworkVariablesOutput NetworkVariables Manufacturer DefinedSection Figure 4LonMark Object Structure2 The LonMark Application Layer InteroperabilityGuidelines provide for the definition of new StandardNetwork Variable Types, LonMark Object Types, andFunctional Profiles. In the mapping of the SEMI CDMto the LonMark object structure in Section 7, extensionsto the current SNVT list and Interoperability Guidelinesare marked with an asterisk (\*). Object type numbersare specified by the guidelines; a device may consist ofone instance of a node object type, and one or moreinstances of LonMark object types, which are assignedsequential instance numbers starting from one.6.8 Network Management  The LonTalk Protocoldefines a complete network management and diagnosticprotocol for LonWorks devices. This protocol is a layerabove the Session layer (request/response service) andprovides mechanisms for application downloading,device address assignment, distribution of destination 2 Diagram notation, the arrow-like symbol used in Figure 4 is definedin the LonMark Application Layer Interoperability Guidelines. addresses for implicit messaging, router configuration,and device-level diagnostics. The LonMark ApplicationLayer Interoperability Guidelines define a devicemanagement layer for LonMark objects. 7 Required Object TypesThe LonMark Application Layer InteroperabilityGuidelines describe sensor, actuator, and controllerobjects. A specific device may be implemented usingthese objects or functional profiles based on theseobjects. The Common Device Model specificationadditionally identifies two objects (namely the DeviceManager (DM) and Sensor Actuator Controller (SAC)objects) that must exist in all SEMI-compliant SANdevices.7.1 Service Requests  Common Device Modelservice requests are implemented as LonTalk foreignframe messages delivered to the application using theLonTalk request/response protocol. The transactionlayer protocol ensures that response messages arecorrelated with the original request message. Tables 3and 4 show the LonTalk APDU format for theRequest/Indication message, and for theResponse/Confirmation message respectively.

Indicates a SEMI SAN-compliant foreign frame message.Object ID 16 Destination objects ID number. Based on the order of the declaration of the instancein the devices external interface documentation string.Service Code 8 Defines the service being requested.Request Parameters optional Service-specific request parameters. Table 4 SEMI SAN Response Message APDU Format Field Name Size (bits) ValueMessage Code 8 Zero indicates successful execution of the requested service. Non-zero indicatesfailure. Values are request-specific.Response Parameters optional Service-specific result parameters. 7.2 Object Attributes  The GetAttribute andSetAttribute service requests may also be implementedas network variable fetch, poll, and update requestsaddressed to the network variable corresponding to thespecified attribute. This is appropriate whenapplication-layer service responses are not required. AGetAttribute service request may be addressed directlyto any network variable as a LonTalk request message,using the LonTalk protocol network management NVfetch mechanism. A GetAttribute service request mayalso be addressed to an output network variable as aLonTalk NV poll message, using the NV selectionmechanism. A SetAttribute service request may beaddressed to an input network variable as a LonTalkNV update message, using the NV selectionmechanism. The confirmation of a SetAttribute(network variable update) is provided by theacknowledged service of the LonTalk protocol transportlayer.Each network variable in a LonMark object is identifiedby means of a self-documentation string stored in thedevices memory. This string contains the object id ofthe object to which this variable belongs, and thesequence number of the network variable within itsenclosing object. For the LonWorks NCS, this sequencenumber is identical to the numerical sequence numberspecified by the CDM tag.Example: Suppose that the Device Manager objectinstance is declared as the second object instance in thedevice. It would, therefore, have object id 1. TheDevice Manager attribute Standard Revision Level hasthe tag DmA2. The self-documentation string for thisnetwork variable is, therefore, specified as @1|2.The Publish notification service is implicit when anoutput network variable is updated. The devicepropagates the value of the output network variable (equivalent to a read-only attribute) to any inputnetwork variable(s) to which it may be bound.The LonTalk protocol only supports propagation ofoutput network variables. In CDM terminology, thismeans that only read-only attributes may be published.If a specific device model requires publication of aread/write attribute, an output network variable whosevalue mirrors the value of the input (read/write)network variable may be introduced to the objectdefinition.7.3 Sensor/Actuator/Controller Object (\*)  TheSEMI CDM SAC object coordinates the functionalityof Sensor, Actuator, and Controller objects in thedevice. A new object type is defined, which forms partof the LonMark Functional Profile for SEMI SAN-compliant devices based on LonWorks. Table 5summarizes the services implemented by the SACobject.Table 5 SAC Object ServicesService Name CDM Tag Service CodeReset SacS1 1Abort SacS2 2Recover SacS3 3 7.4 Device Manager Object (\*)  The SEMI CDMDevice Manager Object combines attributes of deviceself-documentation with an exception reportingmechanism. A new object type is, therefore, definedwith the following mandatory network variables andbehaviors. This object type forms part of the LonMarkFunctional Profile for SEMI SAN-compliant devicesbased on LonWorks. Table 6 summarizes the networkvariables that implement the attributes of the DeviceManager object.

The Publish (DmS8) notification service for the DeviceManager exception status is implemented when thedevice updates the output network variable of typeSNVT\_exc\_status. This causes the value of thisnetwork variable to be propagated across the network toother network variable(s) to which it may be bound.The implementation of the Device Manager objectupdates this output network variable according to theconditions specified by the Reporting Mode andException Status Reporting Interval configurationproperties of the object.7.4.2 Device Manager Object Constant OutputNetwork Variables  Table 6 lists the constant outputnetwork variables of the Device Manager object. Thetype of each of these network variables is either SNVT\_str\_asc, a Standard Network Variable Type thatcan represent from 0 to 30 ASCII characters, orSNVT\_str\_int, a Standard Network Variable Type thatcan represent from 0 to 14 international 16-bitcharacters.7.4.3 Device Manager Object Configuration Properties The DM object has two configuration properties tocontrol exception reporting as shown in Table 6. Theseparameters are of Standard Configuration ParameterTypes (SCPTs).

SEMI E54.6-0997 © SEMI 1997, 2004 10 The type SCPT\_rept\_mode(\*) contains two four-bitfields specifying the reporting method for alarms andwarning conditions. For example, in Neuron C, theapplication programming language used on the NeuronChip, the declaration of SCPT\_rept\_mode is as follows:typedef enum &#123;REP\_REQUEST = 0,REP\_REQ\_LATCHED = 1,REP\_EVT\_TRIGD\_ON = 2,REP\_EVT\_TRIGD\_ONOFF = 3,REP\_TIME\_TRIGD = 4,REP\_EVT\_ON\_TIME\_TRIGD = 5,REP\_EVT\_ONOFF\_TIME\_TRIGD = 6,&#125; rept\_mode\_t;typedef struct &#123;rept\_mode\_t alarm\_rept\_mode :4;rept\_mode\_t warn\_rept\_mode :4;&#125; SCPT\_rept\_mode; The type SCPT\_exc\_sts\_t(\*) is a 16-bit valuerepresenting times from 0.00 to 655.35 seconds, with aresolution of 0.01 seconds. This parameter is optional.The default reporting mode is REP\_REQUEST.7.4.4 Device Manager Object Output NetworkVariables  The Device Manager object has fouroutput network variables as shown in Table 6. The datatype SNVT\_dev\_status is an enumeration,corresponding to the device status attribute defined inTable 6 of the CDM. The values of this type are definedin Table 8.Table 8 Device Status Enumeration ValuesValue Enumeration Tag0 DS\_UNKNOWN1 DS\_INIT\_SELFTEST2 DS\_IDLE3 DS\_SELFTEST\_EXCPT4 DS\_EXECUTING5 DS\_ABORT\_16 DS\_ABORT\_2 The value DS\_ABORT\_1 corresponds to the Abortfrom Idle or Executing state, and the valueDS\_ABORT\_2 corresponds to the Abort fromInitialized/Self Testing or Self Test Exception state ofthe DM object. The type SNVT\_exc\_status(\*) is a union of twostructures, depending on whether expanded or basicexception reporting mode is used. For example, inNeuron C, the declaration of SNVT\_exc\_status is asfollows:typedef union &#123;struct &#123;int excpt\_method : 1; //set to 0int dev\_spec : 7;&#125; basic\_method;struct &#123;int excpt\_method : 1; //set to 1int warn\_mfr\_spec : 1;int warn\_dev\_spec : 1;int warn\_dev\_comn : 1;int resvd : 1;int alrm\_mfr\_spec : 1;int alrm\_dev\_spec : 1;int alrm\_dev\_comn : 1;&#125; expanded\_method;&#125; SNVT\_exc\_status;

SEMI E54.6-0997 © SEMI 1997, 200411 The type SNVT\_exc\_detail(\*) is a sequence of threestructures containing arrays. The LonWorks NetworkCommunication Standard limits the size of each ofthese arrays to 9 bytes, so that the type fits within thenetwork variable size limit of 31 bytes. For example, inNeuron C, the declaration of SNVT\_exc\_detail is asfollows:typedef struct &#123;u\_char comn\_exc\_size;int resvd1 : 1;int real\_time : 1;int communic : 1;int RAM : 1;int EEPROM : 1;int EPROM : 1;int microproc : 1;int diagnostic : 1;/\*--------------------------\*/int resvd2 : 1;int reset : 1;int notify\_mfr : 1;int maintenance : 1;int power\_inputV : 1;int power\_outptV : 1;int power\_resvd : 1;int power\_overC : 1;u\_char comn\_exc\_dtl\[7\];/\*--------------------------\*/u\_char dev\_exc\_size;u\_char dev\_exc\_dtl\[9\];/\*--------------------------\*/u\_char mfr\_exc\_size;u\_char mfr\_exc\_dtl\[9\];&#125; SNVT\_exc\_detail; 7.5 Sensor, Actuator, and Controller Objects  Theseobjects are necessarily specific to the Specific DeviceModels. The LonMark Application LayerInteroperability Guidelines provide a framework fordefining LonMark objects, together with specificationsof generic sensor and actuator objects. Specific DeviceModels may employ these objects, and/or may definetheir own objects and Standard Network VariableTypes for device-specific requirements. As long as theLonMark object definition guidelines are followed, these device-specific objects may be proposed to theLonMark Interoperability Association for incorporationwithin the LonMark guidelines. 8 Protocol ComplianceA method of testing protocol compliance is required toverify implementation conformance to the standard. Byvirtue of the fact that the intermediate layers of theLonTalk protocol are implemented in commerciallyavailable silicon, compliance verification is neededonly at the physical and application layers. TheLonMark Interoperability Association provides acompliance verification service to its members. Whenthe SEMI Sensor/Actuator Network standard isincorporated into the LonMark guidelines, this servicemay be used to verify compliance with the SEMIguidelines.8.1 Interoperability Guidelines Checklist Applicant NameProduct NameStandard Program IDManufacturer IDDevice ClassDevice SubclassModel NumberComm.

SEMI E54.7-0999 © SEMI 19991 SEMI E54.7-0999STANDARD FOR SENSOR/ACTUATOR NETWORK COMMUNICATIONFOR SERIPLEX This standard was technically approved by the Global Information & Control Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Information & Control Committee. Current edition approved by theNorth American Regional Standards Committee on July 15, 1999. Initially available at www.semi.orgAugust 1999; to be published September 1999. 1 Purpose1.1 This standard defines a commu nicationspecification based on the Seriplex protocol to enablecommunications between intelligent devices on asensor/actuator network (SAN) that operate accordingto SEMI specified device models (common and devicespecific) in a semiconductor manufacturing tool.1.2 Background and Motivation1.2.1 Seriplex is a component level network whichprovides a simple, inexpensive, fast, and deterministicmeans of exchanging data among control levelindustrial devices (e.g., sensors and actuators) andhigher level devices such as controllers. Seriplexprovides: A solution to low-level device networking Access to intelligence present in low-level devices Networking between higher level controllers Master/Slave and Peer-to-Peer capabilities1.2.2 Seriplex specifies a communic ation model andprotocol as well as a complete Physical Layerdefinition.1.2.3 This document enables commu nications betweenintelligent devices on a SEMI compliant SAN byproviding a presentation mapping of common andspecific device network visible structure and behaviorto a Seriplex network. 2 Scope2.1 This document specifies the pr otocol and servicesthat compliant intelligent devices must support toexchange information over this semiconductorequipment sensor/actuator network.2.2 This document specifies the ut ilization of theSeriplex protocol to present externally visible devicestructure and behavior, specified in the CommonDevice Model (CDM) and appropriate Specific DeviceModels (SDMs), on a Seriplex network.2.3 This document is used in conju nction with a SEMIstandard SAN Common Device Model specification,one or more SEMI standard Specific Device Model (SDM) specifications (e.g. for a mass flow controller)and the Seriplex Standard Specification. Together, theydescribe the Seriplex protocol, the externally visibledata structures and behaviors of devices utilizing theSeriplex networking capability in a SEMI compliantSAN system.2.4 This standard does not purport to address all of thesafety issues associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicablity of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This document specifies a sem iconductorequipment SAN based solely on Seriplex and is acompanion document to the Seriplex standardspecification; thus a complete specification of thisstandard necessarily includes the Seriplex standardspecifications. There are other semiconductorequipment SAN communications options. Thespecifications for these options are not included here.3.2 This standard specifies enhanc ements that provideadditional capabilities over and above those currentlyrequired by Seriplex. In order to avoid documentconsistency problems, information in the Seriplexstandard specification that relates to this standard is notrepeated in this document. This document is limited todescribing enhancements or limitations to the Seriplexstandard specification that are imposed by this standard. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E54.1  Standard for Sensor/Actuator NetworkCommon Device ModelSEMI E54.3  Specification for Sensor/ActuatorNetwork Specific Device Model for Mass Flow Device

Conforming implementationsmust implement the services defined in thisspecification at each layer and must appear (from thenetwork) to have implemented this architecture,however an internal modular partitioning is notrequired. Implementations may sacrifice modularity inorder to achieve high performance.6.1.2 The Seriplex physical layer is fully specified inthe Seriplex Standard Specification. There are guidelinespecified for the topology of the bus cable, length ofbus cable and number of bus nodes within the system.Typical configurations include: Daisy Chain,Trunk/Dropline, Tree, Loop, Star and Combinations ofthe above. Reference guidelines are specified for thecable length and node limits determined by a systemsClock rate and total data line capacity within a system.Bus Power Supply provides power for the Seriplex busitself  that is, for the Seriplex bus communicationcircuitry within each bus device. The bus power supplynormally provides a 24 VDC source for the bus. Ingeneral, the bus supply does not provide power tomonitoring and control devices. Application Layer Data Link Physical Layer Layered View of Seriplex Application Layer Presentation Layer Session Layer Transport LayerNetwork Layer Data Link Layer Physical Layer OSI Reference Model Transport Layer Figure 1Layered View of Seriplex 6.1.3 At the data link layer, the Serip lex standardmessaging specification defines a carrier sense multipleaccess mechanism for media access control thatsupports non-destructive collision resolution and sendsframes reliably.6.1.4 The application layer is specif ied in the Seriplexstandard specification and provides for the definition ofSeriplex applications as a collection of addressable objects. A subset of these objects may be addressedover the network (as defined by the implementation).6.1.5 In the remainder of this section the protocolstructure is described in more detail in terms of the OSIseven layer reference model, the object modelenvironment and network management specifications.6.2 Physical Layer  The device shall comply withthe Seriplex physical layer specification (contained inSeriplex standard specification). This includes physicalsignaling (levels and data rates), transceivers, nodeisolation, media topology, cable specifications, networkconnectors and taps, and power considerations (loadlimits, system tolerances, and power supply options).6.3 Data Link Layer  The devic e shall comply withthe Seriplex standard specification for the Data LinkLayer. This includes the media access controlmechanism and the logical link control mechanism.Addressing is currently limited to 8 bits of sourceaddress and 8 bits of destination address. Bitwisearbitration is used to gain access to the network in caseswhere multiple nodes contend for the same messagebandwidth.6.4 Network Layer  There is no distinct networklayer.6.5 Transport (Messaging) Layer  The device shallcomply with the Seriplex standard specification for theMessaging Layer. The messaging layer providestransparent transfer of data between objects inapplication-entities. Some of the functionality, of thislayer is implemented in the Application Layer. Specificfunctions include: segmentation/re-assembly (fragmen-tation) for full message delivery.6.6 Session Layer  There is no d istinct session layer.6.7 Presentation Layer  There is no distinctpresentation layer. Object addressing and datapresentation in Seriplex messages are specified as partof the Seriplex object definitions and object attributeand service communication protocol.6.8 Application Layer  The devi ce shall complywith the Seriplex application layer specification fordefining and addressing objects, including theirattributes and services, and enabling specified networkbehavior. The device shall comply with the objectmessaging and object model specifications included inthe Seriplex standard specification. In addition thedevice shall comply with the object specificationsdefined in Section 7 of this document.6.8.1 Object Models  The Seriplex protocol hasbeen enhanced to provide an object-orientedspecification for creating, defining and addressingobjects explicitly, including their attributes and

In addition thedevice shall comply with the object specificationsdefined in Section 7 of this document.6.8.2 Alternate Method for the Com municationTransmission of Attributes  In order to takeadvantage of the Seriplex networks speed anddeterministic characteristics, the Seriplex StandardSpecification details a mechanism of transmitting dataover the network by assigning, in advance, a sequenceof serial frames to be used collectively to deliverspecific sensor and/or actuator attribute data. Thismechanism can be utilized as an alternative to theobject messaging specification of the Seriplex StandardSpecification to implement the behavior associated withthe GetAttribute and SetAttribute services detailed inSection 7. This mechanism may be used to provide anefficient and optimum implementation of datatransmission over the network.6.9 Network Management  The device shall complywith the Seriplex network management specificationsdetailed in the Seriplex Standard Specification (e.g.,physical layer bit rate, master/slave and peer-to-peernetwork management, etc.). No (additional) networkmanagement functions are specified in this document. 7 Required Object Types7.1 At this time, the Seriplex Stan dard Specificationdoes not require any specific objects to exist in aSeriplex device in order to be a compliant Seriplexdevice. The Seriplex Standard Specification will beextended to identify and describe objects (i.e. classes)that must exist in devices that are to be interoperableand interchangeable on a Seriplex SEMI compliantSAN network.7.1.1 The Common Device Model s pecificationidentifies two objects (namely the Device Manager(DM) and Sensor Actuator Controller (SAC) objects)that must exist in all SEMI compliant SAN devices.The required object types for a SEMI compliant SANdevice utilizing the network communicationspecification described herein, necessarily comprisesthe union of the above two requirements.7.1.2 A list of required and optional object types isgiven in Table 2. Additional objects that are specified in a particular SDM are given identifiers in that SDMspecification; Seriplex specific presentation informationfor these identifiers is given in Section 9 of thisdocument.7.1.3 An embodiment of a specific d evice type,represented as an aggregation of the object types listedin Table 2, that is compliant with both the CDMspecification and the Seriplex specification, is acandidate for a SEMI SDM as well as a Seriplex devicedefinition. Conversely, all SEMI SDMs and Seriplexdevice definitions specified for operation over a SEMIcompliant Seriplex network must be an aggregation ofthe object types listed in Table 2, and be compliant withboth the CDM specification and the Seriplex standardspecification.7.1.4 In the following sections the p resentation to thenetwork of object addressing, object attributes, andobject services for each of the object types listed inTable 2 is described in detail. Refer to the CDMstandard to determine if the object instance attribute andservice is specified as required or optional. Unlessotherwise noted, all attributes and services describedare instance level attributes (as opposed to class levelattributes). A class level attribute and service isaccessed as instance number zero.7.1.5 Note that the formats of object attributes andservices are detailed in the CDM document; thepresentation of object attributes and services to theSeriplex network is detailed in the tables contained inthe following sub-sections and in the Seriplex standardspecification.7.2 Device Manager (DM) Object  The DM objectis the device component responsible for managing andconsolidating the device operation. Each device mustsupport one (and only one) DM object. The DM objectas well as its common required and optional attributes,services and behavior are described in the CDMstandard. The presentation of object instance attributesand services to the Seriplex network shall be asindicated in Table 3.7.2.1 Note that the formats of DM o bject attributes aredetailed in the CDM document; the presentation of DMobject attributes to the Seriplex network is detailed inTable 3 and the Seriplex standard specification; theformat of DM object services is detailed in the CDMdocument and the Seriplex standard specification; andthe presentation of the DM object services is detailed inTable 3 and the Seriplex standard specification.

SEMI E54.8-0305 © SEMI 1999, 20051 SEMI E54.8-0305SPECIFICATION FOR SENSOR/ACTUATOR NETWORKCOMMUNICATIONS FOR PROFIBUS-DP This specification was technically approved by the Global Information & Control Committee and is the directresponsibility of the European Information & Control Committee. Current edition approved by the EuropeanRegional Standards Committee on October 7, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org February 2005; to bepublished March 2005. Originally published September 1999. 1 Purpose1.1 This specification is part of the SEMI Sensor/Actuator Network (SAN) suite of standards and defines a specificcommunications protocol based on the PROFIBUS-DP standard. This Network Communication Standard (NCS)taken together with the SEMI Sensor/Actuator Network standard suite and the PROFIBUS standard completely andunambiguously defines an open standard providing an industry specific solution to off-the-shelf interoperability ofnetworked devices in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.1.2 PROFIBUS is a vendor independent, open fieldbus standard for a wide range of applications in manufacturing,process and building automation. Vendor independence and openness are guaranteed by the IEC standards forPROFIBUS, IEC 61158 part 2 to part 6 and IEC 61784-1. PROFIBUS-DP is one version of PROFIBUS which isoptimized for high speed and inexpensive connectivity between automation control systems and distributed I/O atthe device level. 2 Scope2.1 This document specifies a SAN communications standard based on the PROFIBUS-DP specification that is incompliance with SEMI E54.1. As such, it specifies the protocol, services, and behavior that compliant intelligentdevices must support in order to interchange information over this SAN in a method compatible with SEMI E39.2.2 In conjunction with a SEMI standard SAN Common Device Model (CDM) specification and one or more SEMIstandard Specific Device Model (SDM) specifications (e.g., for a Mass Flow Controller, In-Situ Particle MonitorDevices or Endpoint Devices), this Network Communication Standard (NCS) with the related PROFIBUS-DPstandard describe the data structures, interactions, and behavior that are characteristic of the various devices on thenetwork. This composite model forms a complete interoperability standard for communications among intelligentsensors, actuators, and controllers in semiconductor manufacturing equipment. NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This document specifies a semiconductor equipment SAN based solely on PROFIBUS-DP and is a companiondocument to the PROFIBUS-DP specification; thus, a complete specification of this standard necessarily includesthe PROFIBUS-DP specifications. There are other semiconductor equipment SAN communications options. Thespecifications for these options are not included here.3.2 The specifications within are strictly enhancements that provide additional capabilities over and above thosecurrently required by PROFIBUS-DP. Included throughout this document, primarily in 6, is informationparaphrased from the PROFIBUS-DP specifications such as: protocol structure, capabilities, options, andlimitations. This information is provided here for reference only and is not intended to provide specificationdefinitions. In all such areas, refer to the PROFIBUS-DP specification documents for information. This documentis limited to describing enhancements or limitations to the PROFIBUS-DP specification that are imposed by thisstandard.3.3 A complete specification of the conformance testing procedure shall include the PROFIBUS-DP protocolconformance testing specification. Conformance testing shall also include enhancements and limitations to thePROFIBUS-DP specification required by this standard.

SEMI E54.8-0305 © SEMI 1999, 20055 6.1.1 Message transfer is organized in cycles. A message cycle mainly consists of a request-frame followed by acorresponding acknowledge/response-frame of the addressed station. An exception to this is the global-controlfunction for synchronization and coordination of several remote I/O stations.6.1.2 A brief description of the PROFIBUS-DP protocol as it relates to the ISO 7498 OSI model follows in thesections below. For protocol efficiency, PROFIBUS-DP does not define layers 3 to 6. Layer 7 is the interfacebetween the Application Process and the communication stack.NOTE 1: The information contained in this section is for reference only. It in no way represents specifications for PROFIBUS-DP. See related documentation for these specifications.6.2 Physical Layer  Layer 16.2.1 There are three options specified for the Physical Layer (PHY): Manchester Coded Interface for Bus PoweredSystems, RS-485 and Optical. See the PROFIBUS-DP standard for more information about these options.6.3 Data Link Layer  Layer 26.3.1 Data Transfer6.3.1.1 The Data Link Layer or Fieldbus Data Link (FDL) provides the functions for sending and receiving dataover the network. Protocol Data Units (PDU) are packaged, delivered, and checked. Acknowledgements,responses, retries, and timeouts are used to guard against Line Protocol Errors (e.g., frame, overrun, and parity) andTransmission Protocol Errors (e.g., start and end delimiters, frame check, frame length, and response times).6.3.1.2 A PDU is restricted to 246 bytes. In addition to the PDU, a transmission frame of variable length willcontain 8 bytes of overhead; one of fixed length (8 bytes) will contain 6 bytes of overhead. Variousacknowledgement and response frames are also defined.6.3.1.3 To better understand the FDL, a summary of FDL data transfer services is given by the following list: Send Data with Acknowledge (SDA), Send Data with No Acknowledge (SDN), and Send and Request Data with Reply (SRD).6.4 Application Layer  Layer 76.4.1 The PROFIBUS application layer is structured in a so called service definition and protocol specification.The service definition uses an object orientated approach and specifies the services for remote access and localfunctions together with their objects (the ASE is a class definition of these objects). The protocol specificationincludes both coding and state machines.6.4.2 Service Definition6.4.2.1 Application layer services are structured to reflect the needs of flexible configurable automation devices. ADevice consists of a set of modules that are placed in slots (see Figure 2). Modules are addressed uniquely by theslot number. The module view can be a hardware oriented or reflects the software structure of the DP-Slave.6.4.3 Slot 0 is used to address the DP Slave itself. Subslot 0 represents the module and contains no IO Data. Theother object classes can have instances scattered over the modules addressed by slot number. Each module cancontain IO Data, Context parameter, Diagnosis information, Process Data and Alarms. Process Data is a genericclass which can contain different application specific parameters accessible by read and write services. There is aset of identification and maintenance parameters defined in a PROFIBUS Guideline.6.4.3.1 Object classes are defined for: IO Data for periodic reporting, Context for configuration, Diagnosis for event collection, Process Data for polled access, and Alarms for asynchronous event reporting.

Client/Server service structure (request/response) is used for Record Data, Context and Diagnosis.6.4.4 Protocol Specification6.4.4.1 A DP-Slave shall get a FDL address before using it in the target configuration.6.4.4.2 To access a DP-Slave the DP-Master has to check the availability with a Slave-Diag service. To establishthe context a SetPrm service is issued first. A check is done to ensure that the appropriate device type with therequired resources is accessed. The following ChkCfg service. Another Slave Diag service has been used to checkthe establishment of the application relationship.6.4.4.3 After this start up procedure the data exchange of IO data can be done and alarms can be signaled from theDP Slave to the DP Master. The DP Master can invoke services to read and write process data that contain all kindof information e.g. produced units, calibration information, and batch information.6.4.4.4 A context is monitored by the Data Exchange Service at the DP-Slave. The DP-Master monitors thecommunication by the receipt of the responses to the FDL services.6.4.5 Data Link Mapping Protocol Machine (DMPM)6.4.5.1 The DMPM performs the interpretation of service requests from, and responses to, the Application ProtocolMachines. Table 2 is included to demonstrate the basic structure of the PROFIBUS-DP DMPM. For speed andefficiency, the PROFIBUS-DP protocol defines the Service Access Point (SAP). These are included in thetransmission protocol to direct messages within the device for fast dedicated processing. Defined are DestinationSAP (DSAP) and Source SAP (SSAP).6.4.6 I&M Functions6.4.6.1 Identification & Maintenance Functions (I&M functions) define general parameters and protocols. Themain purpose of the I&M functions is to support the end user during various scenarios of a devices life cycle be itconfiguration, commissioning, parameterization, diagnosis, repair, firmware update, asset management, audittrailing, and alike. Well-defined uniform parameters and rules should enable the manufacturers to offer devices thatbehave in a uniform manner These profile guidelines take into account requirements from FDA (Food & DrugAdministration) and others. The basic information offered can be characterized as Type Plate or Boiler Plate. Itconsists of Manufacturer ID, Order ID, Serial Number, Hardware Revision, Software Revision, Revision Counter,and Profile ID. D P S la v e . . .S l o t 0S lo t 1 c a r r ie sM o d u le x ...

The FDL message frameincludes fields for Source and Destination SAP. By directing a message to a particular Destination SAP, its contextis immediately known. This provides a fast and interoperable environment for device messaging.6.4.8 Device Profile/Device Data Base6.4.8.1 PROFIBUS devices have different performance characteristics. Features differ in regard to availablefunctionality (i.e., number of I/O signals and diagnostic messages) or possible bus parameters such as baud rate andtime monitoring. These parameters vary individually for each device type and vendor. These parameters are usuallydocumented in the technical manual. To achieve simple plug-and-play configuration of PROFIBUS, thecharacteristic features are specified in an electronic data sheet called a Device Data Base file or GSD file.6.4.8.2 The GSD Files provide a clear and comprehensive description of the characteristics of a device type in aprecisely defined format. These are prepared individually by the vendor for each type of device and made availableto the user in the form of a Device Data Base Sheet and a GSD File. The device data base file is divided into threeparts: General Specifications, Master Related Specifications, and Slave Related Specifications.6.4.8.3 These GSD Files are maintained and managed by the PROFIBUS Trade Organization.6.5 Network Management6.5.1 The PROFIBUS-DP system is managed through several phases of operation. A Master device must haveknowledge of the Device Profile for each of the Slave devices it will connect. The Device Data Base Files serve thispurpose. Upon initialization, a Master will control a DP-Slave through three operational modes: Parameterization,Configuration, and I/O Data Exchange. In any operational mode, a Master may interrogate a DP-Slave for itsDiagnostic information.6.5.2 In the sections that follow, these operation modes are mapped to related SAN CDM behavior states. 7 Required Object Types7.1 This section describes a general mapping of the SEMI SAN Object Model to the PROFIBUS-DP environment.Component definitions are clarified and the mapping of Attributes, Services, and Behaviors are specified.

SEMI E54.9-0303 © SEMI 2000, 20031 SEMI E54.9-0303SPECIFICATION FOR SENSOR/ACTUATOR NETWORKCOMMUNICATION FOR MODBUS/TCP OVER TCP/IP This specification was technically approved by the Global Information and Control Committee and is thedirect responsibility of the North American Information and Control Committee. Current edition approved bythe North American Regional Standards Committee on October 25, 2002. Initially available atwww.semi.org December 2002; to be published March 2003. Originally published February 2000; previouslypublished October 2000. 1 Purpose1.1 This standard defines a communicationspecification based on the Modbus/TCP protocol over aTransmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP) network to enable communications betweenintelligent devices on a sensor/actuator network (SAN)that operate according to SEMI specified device models(common and device specific) in a semiconductormanufacturing tool.1.2 Background and Motivation1.2.1 Modbus/TCP over TCP/IP is a component levelnetwork which provides a simple, inexpensive, and fastmeans of exchanging data among control levelindustrial devices (e.g., sensors and actuators) andhigher level devices such as controllers. Modbus/TCPover TCP/IP provides: A solution to low-level device networking, Access to intelligence present in low-level devices, Networking between higher level controllers, and Master/Slave and Peer-to-Peer communicationcapabilities.1.2.2 Modbus/TCP specifies a communication modeland protocol. The Physical, Data Link, and NetworkLayer definitions are defined by the network in whichthe Modbus/TCP protocol is embedded such as TCP/IPEthernet.1.2.3 This document enables communications betweenintelligent devices on a SEMI compliant SAN byproviding a presentation mapping of common andspecific device network visible structure and behaviorto Modbus/TCP over a TCP/IP network. 2 Scope2.1 This document specifies the protocol and servicesthat compliant intelligent devices must support toexchange information over this semiconductorequipment sensor/actuator network.2.2 This document specifies the utilization of theModbus/TCP protocol to present externally visible device structure and behavior, specified in the CommonDevice Model (CDM) and appropriate Specific DeviceModels (SDMs), for the Modbus/TCP protocol over aTCP/IP network.2.3 This document is used in conjunction with a SEMIstandard SAN Common Device Model specification,one or more SEMI standard Specific Device Model(SDM) specifications (e.g., for a mass flow device), theModicon Modbus Protocol Reference Guide and theOpen Modbus/TCP Specification. Together, theydescribe the Modbus/TCP protocol, the externallyvisible data structures and behaviors of devices utilizingthe Modbus/TCP networking capability in a SEMIcompliant SAN system. 3 Limitations3.1 This document specifies a semiconductorequipment SAN based solely on Modbus/TCP over aTCP/IP network and is a companion document to theOpen Modbus/TCP Specification; thus a completespecification of this standard necessarily includes theModbus/TCP and Modbus protocol specifications.There are other semiconductor equipment SANcommunications options. The specifications for theseoptions are not included here.3.2 This standard specifies enhancements that provideadditional capabilities over and above those currentlyrequired by Modbus/TCP. In order to avoid documentconsistency problems, information in the Modbus/TCPstandard specifications that relate to this standard is notrepeated in this document. This document is limited todescribing enhancements or limitations to theModbus/TCP standard specifications that are imposedby this standard.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use.

The Modbus/TCP overTCP/IP standard specifies OSI reference model layers1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 specifically the physical signaling, themedia access/data link protocols, internetworkingcapability, the transport capability of end-to-endtransmission of data, and the application layer.5.4.4 peer-to-peer  on Modbus/TCP over TCP/IPnetworks, messages formatted according to theModbus/TCP protocol are embedded into the TCPpacket structure that is used on the TCP/IP network.The Modbus protocol over TCP/IP supports theasynchronous or unsolicited bi-directional transmissionof data between nodes. This type of communication isreferred to as peer-to-peer. 6 Communication Protocol High LevelStructure6.1 The Modbus/TCP protocol over TCP/IP is looselybased on a five-layer architecture. These layersconstitute a collapsed form of the OSI seven layerarchitecture, mapping into the physical, data link,network, transport, and application layers of theReference Model. This section has been formatted to bealigned with the Basic Reference Model for OSI. Thehigh-level protocol architecture is shown in Figure 1. Application Layer Application LayerPresentation LayerSession LayerTransport Layer Transport LayerNetwork Layer Network LayerData Link Layer Data Link LayerPhysical Layer Physical Layer Layered View of Modbus/TCP OSI Reference Model Figure 1Layered View of Modbus/TCP Over TCP/IP NOTE 2: Figure 1 represents a conceptual view of the com-munication device architecture. Conforming implementationsmust implement the services defined in this specification ateach layer and must appear (from the network) to haveimplemented this architecture, however, an internal modularpartitioning is not required. Implementations may sacrificemodularity in order to achieve high performance.6.1.1 The application layer is specified in the ModiconModbus Protocol Reference Guide and provides for thedefinition of Modbus applications as a collection ofaddressable objects. A subset of these objects may be addressed over the network (as defined by theimplementation).6.1.2 In the remainder of this section the protocolstructure is described in more detail in terms of the OSIseven layer reference model, the object modelenvironment and network management specifications.6.2 Physical Layer  The device shall comply with aphysical layer specification identified in theModbus/TCP specification. The recommended anddefault Modbus/TCP physical layer is IEEE 802.3. Ifan accepted physical layer specification other thanIEEE 802.3 is being used, this must be clearly specifiedin product literature. Physical layer specificationincludes physical signaling (levels and data rates),transceivers, node isolation, media topology, cablespecifications, network connectors and taps, and powerconsiderations (load limits, system tolerances, andpower supply options).6.3 Data Link Layer  The device shall comply with adata link layer specification of the Modbus/TCPspecification. The recommended and default Modbus/TCP data link layer is IEEE 802.3. If an accepted datalink layer specification other than IEEE 802.3 is beingused, this must be clearly specified in product literature.Data link layer specification includes the media accesscontrol mechanism and the logical link controlmechanism.6.4 Network Layer  The device shall comply with anetwork layer specification of the Modbus/TCP specifi-cation. This specification is the IP or Internet Protocolas defined in the Modbus/TCP standard specification.The network layer specification includes networkrouting and internetworking.6.5 Transport (Messaging) Layer  The device shallcomply with the Modbus/TCP standard specificationfor the Transport Layer. This specification is theTransmission Control Protocol as defined in theModbus/TCP standard specification. The transportlayer provides transparent transfer of data betweenobjects in application-entities. Some of the functionalityof this layer is implemented in the Application Layer.Specific functions include: object data segmentation/re-assembly (fragmentation) for full message delivery.6.6 Session Layer  There is no distinct session layer.6.7 Presentation Layer  There is no distinctpresentation layer. Object addressing and datapresentation in Modbus messages are specified as partof the Modbus object definitions and object attributeand service communication protocol. Data bytetransmission ordering is defined in IP RFC 791,Appendix B.
