This test method deals only with junction-to-casemeasurements of thermal resistance and limits itself tofluid bath testing environments. For this test,conduction through the leads is minimized, thusproviding information on the ability of the plasticpackage material to dissipate heat. Due to thethermophysical properties of the heat transfer fluidsused and the effects of the variable nature of the fluid-stirring and package-mounting procedures, this testmethod should only be used for comparing the thermalcharacteristics of plastic packages in the same fluid bathsystem. 2 Applicable Documents2.1 SEMI SpecificationSEMI G32  Guideline for Unencapsulated ThermalTest Chip 3 DefinitionsThe following definitions and symbols shall apply forthe purpose of this test:case temperature, TC  in degrees Celsius.

Thermocouple material shall be copper-constantan(type T) or equivalent, for the temperature range-100 to + 300\xb0C. The wire size shall be no largerthan AWG size 30. The junction of thethermocouple shall be welded to form a bead ratherthan soldered or twisted. The accuracy of thethermocouple and associated measuring systemshall be \xb1 0.5\xb0C.b. Suitable electrical equipment as required to providecontrolled levels of conditioning power and to makethe specified measurements. The instrument used toelectrically measure the temperature-sensitiveparameter shall be capable of resolving a voltagechange of 0.5 mV.c. Controlled temperature chamber or fluid bathcapable of maintaining the specified reference pointtemperature to within \xb1 0.5\xb0C of the preset(measured) value. A typical temperature-controlledfluid bath assembly is presented for illustrativepurposes only. 4.1 Fluid Bath Assembly  A typi cal temperature-controlled fluid bath for thermally characterizing themicroelectronic device under test is shown in Figure 1.In this figure, the package is mounted in a fluid bathseparate from the fluid circulator, although it can beimmersed directly in an integrated fluid circulator/bathunit. The fluid in the bath should be continuouslystirred or agitated to ensure the required temperaturestability and uniformity. Since this working fluid isbeing used as an infinite heat-sink, the case-to-fluid(ambient) temperature difference at the casetemperature reference point of interest should beminimized, i.e., \u2264 20\xb0C.

For leaded devices,the leads should be oriented in such a manner so as notto interfere with the heat transfer to the fluid andprovide freedom to any thermal currents caused by thepower dissipation within the package. The microcircuitpackage shall be mounted such that conduction coolingthrough the leads or test socket or both shall be smallcompared to the other cooling mechanisms. Tominimize conduction through the leads, a special socketjig that connects No. 36 AWG wire to the device socketshould be used.The case temperature of the device under test should bemeasured with a thermocouple that is attached to thepackage/lead and should not be assumed to be at thefluid temperature. The working fluid should have athermal conductivity at 25\xb0C of at least 0.0006W/cm\xb0C. Working fluids such as inert fluorocarbonliquids and silicone oils are suitable as cooling media. 5 Procedure5.1 Direct Measurement of Refere nce PointTemperature, TR = Tc  For the purpose of measuringa microelectronic device thermal resistance, thereference point temperature shall be measured at thepackage location of highest temperature which isaccessible from outside the package. This referencepoint location is determined with the device operatingin free air and with no external heat-sinking. In general,this reference point is found to be on the surface of thebody of the package, or on a lead near the body, in themajor path of heat flow from the chip heating surface tothe ambient fluid. The package surface may be alteredto facilitate this measurement provided that suchalteration does not affect the original heat transfer pathsand, hence, the thermal resistance, within the packageby more than a few percent.5.1.1 Case Temperature, Tc  The microelectronicdevice under test shall be mounted under specifiedconditions so that the case temperature can be held atthe specified value. A thermocouple shall be attachedon the surface of the device package directly under thechip (i.e., on the base plane of the package). Aconducting epoxy may be used for this purpose. Thethermocouple bead should be in direct mechanicalcontact with the package of the microelectronic deviceunder test. Care should be taken to minimize exposureof the thermocouple bead to the high temperaturegradient in the fluid film boundary layer at the package-fluid interface. If it is found that attaching the thermocouple directly tothe case is impractical, an alternate approach using athermocouple welded to one side of a thin metal diskshould be used. This can be accomplished by parallelgap welding the crossed thermocouple wires to one sideof a 0.25 cm (0.094 in) diameter, 0.02 cm (0.008 in)thick beryllium-copper disk and then, with a thin layerof adhesive, bonding the other side of the disk to thecase at the point of interest. The exposed thermocouplebead/wire on the disk shall be covered with epoxy orsilicone rubber. The attached thermocouple should notunduly interfere with heat transfer to the fluid.5.2 Thermal Resistance, Junction-t o-SpecifiedReference Point, RJR5.2.1 General Considerations  Th e thermalresistance of a semiconductor device is a measure of theability of its carrier or package and mounting techniqueto provide for heat removal from the semiconductorjunction. The thermal resistance of a microelectronicdevice can be calculated when the case temperature andpower dissipation in the device and a measurement ofthe junction temperature are known.When making the indicated measurements, the packageshall be considered to have achieved thermalequilibrium when halving the time between theapplication of power and the taking of the readingcauses no error in the indicated results within therequired accuracy of measurement.5.2.2 Indirect Measurement of Junct ion Temperaturefor the Determination of RJR  The purpose of the testis to measure the thermal resistance of integratedcircuits by using particular semiconductor elements onthe chip to indicate the device junction temperature. Inorder to obtain a realistic estimate of the operatingjunction temperature, the whole chip in the packageshould be powered in order to provide the properinternal temperature distribution. During measurementof the junction temperature, the chip heating power(constant voltage source) shall remain constant whilethe junction calibration current remains stable. It isassumed that the calibration current will not be affectedby the circuit operation during the application ofheating power.The temperature-sensitive device parameter is used asan indicator of an average (weighted) junctiontemperature of the semiconductor element forcalculations of thermal resistance. The measuredjunction temperature is indicative of the temperatureonly in the immediate vicinity of the element used tosense the temperature.The temperature-sensitive electrical parametersgenerally used to indirectly measure the junctiontemperature are the forward voltage of diodes and the"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 15 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI G43-87 \xa9 SEMI 1986, 19873 emitter-base voltage of bipolar transistors. Otherappropriate temperature-sensitive parameters may beused for indirectly measuring junction temperature forfabrication technologies that do not lend themselves tosensing the active junction voltages.5.2.2.1 Steady-State Technique for Me asuring TJ The following symbols shall apply for the purpose ofthese measurements:I M  ring current in milliamperes.V MH  Value of temperature-sensitive parameters inmillivolts, measured at I M, and corresponding to thetemperature of the junction heated by P H .TMC  Calibration temperature in degrees Celsius,measured at the reference point.V MC  Value of temperature-sensitive parameter inmillivolts, measured at IM and specific value of T MC.The measurement of T J using junction forward voltageas the TSP is made in the following manner:Step 1  Measurement of the temperature coefficientof the TSP (calibration).The coefficient of the temperature-sensitive parameteris generated by measuring the TSP as a function of thereference point temperature, for a specified constantmeasuring current, I M, by externally heating the deviceunder test in an oven or in a fluid bath. The referencepoint temperature range used during calibration shallencompass the temperature range encountered in thepower application test (see Step 2). The measuringcurrent is generally chosen such that the TSP decreaseslinearly with increasing temperature over the range ofinterest and that negligible internal heating occurs in thesilicon and metal traces. For determining the optimumTSP calibration or measuring current, V MC vs. log I Mcurves for two temperature levels that encompass thecalibration temperature range of interest should beplotted. The optimum measuring current, I M, is thenselected such that it resides on the linear portion of thetwo V MC vs. log I M curves that were generated. Ameasuring current ranging from 0.05 to 5 mA isgenerally used, depending on the specifications andoperating conditions of the device under test, formeasuring the TSP. The value of the TSP temperaturecoefficient V MC/T MC, for the particular measuringcurrent used in the test, is calculated from thecalibration curve, V MC vs. T MC. At least three pointsshould be used to generate the voltage vs. temperaturecurve for the determination of the TSP temperaturecoefficient.Step 2  Power application test.The power application test is performed in two parts.For both portions of the test, the reference point temperature is held constant at a preset value. The firstmeasurement to be made is that of the temperature-sensitive parameter, i.e., VMC, under operatingconditions with the measuring current, I M, used duringthe calibration procedure. The microelectronic deviceunder test shall then be operated with heating power(P H ) applied. The temperature-sensitive parameter,V MH , shall be measured with constant measuringcurrent, I M, that was applied during the calibrationprocedure (see Step 1).The heating power, P H , shall be chosen such that thecalculated junction-to-reference point temperaturedifference as measured at VMH is \u2265 20\xb0C. Inaccomplishing this, the device under test should not beoperated at such a high heating power level that the on-chip temperature-sensing and heating circuitry is nolonger electrically isolated. Care should also be takennot to exceed the design ratings of the package-interconnect system, as this may lead to anoverestimation of the power being dissipated in theactive area of the chip due to excessive power losses inthe package leads and wire bonds. The values of V MH ,V MC, and P H are recorded during the power applicationtest.The following data shall be recorded for these testconditions:a. Temperature-sensitive electrical parameters (VF,V EB, or other appropriate TSP).b. Junction temperature, T J, is calculated from theequation: TJ = TR + VMH  VMC( ) VMCTMC  1 where TR = TC c.

This test is not a valid method forpredicting the flashing performance in all mold types. Itis a method for comparing flash tendency and flashingtype of different molding compounds when evaluatedunder a specific set of molding process parameters.2.2 Flashing presents problems wi th subsequentprocessing of plastic packaged devices after molding. Ahigh flashing tendency increases die wear in the trimand form operation, may interfere with plating or solderdip finishing operations, and may prevent good contactfor electrical test. Thus, reduced tendency towardflashing will improve the plastic package subassemblyoperations.

These voids impede the flow of heat fromthe chip to the substrate (package). Due to thedifference in the thermal time constants of the chip andpackage, the measurement of transient thermal responsecan be made more sensitive to the presence of voidsthan can the measurement of steady state thermalresponse. This is because the chip thermal time constantis generally several orders of magnitude shorter thanthat of the package. Thus, the heating power pulsewidth can be selected so that only the chip and the chipto substrate interface are heated during the pulse byusing a pulse width somewhat greater than the chipthermal time constant, but less than that of thesubstrate. Heating power pulse widths ranging from 10to 400 milliseconds have been found to satisfy thiscriterion. This enables the detection of voids to begreatly enhanced, with the added advantage of nothaving to heat sink the device under test. Thus, thetransient thermal response technique is less timeconsuming than the measurement of thermal resistancefor use as a manufacturing screen, process control orincoming inspection measure for die attachmentintegrity evaluation.1.3 References  The following d ocuments arerecommended reading for reference and test methodstandard description purposes:SEMI G32  Unencapsulated Thermal Test ChipMIL-STD-883C1  Method 1012, ThermalCharacteristics 2 DefinitionsThe following symbols and terminology shall apply forthe purpose of this test method. 1 Military Standards, Naval Publications and Form Center, 5801Tabor Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19120 2.1 V F  the forward biased volta ge of the diodejunction within the Device-Under-Test (DUT) used forjunction temperature sensing.2.2 V Fi  the initial VF value befo re application ofheating power.2.3 V Ff  the final V F value after application ofheating power.2.4 V F  the change in the temp erature sensitiveparameter, V F, due to the application of heating powerto the DUT.2.5 V H  the voltage applied to th e DUT during theheating time in order to cause power dissipation.2.6 I H  the heating current result ing from theapplication of VH to the DUT.2.7 P H  the heating power pulse magnitude; productof V H and I H .2.8 tH  the duration of P H (applie d to the DUT).2.9 I M  the measurement current used to forwardbias the temperature sensing diode junction formeasurement of VF.2.10 tMD  measurement delay tim e can be defined inone of two ways:2.10.1 the time from the start of heati ng power (P H )removal to the completion of the final VF measurement;or2.10.2 the time from the start of heati ng power (P H )removal to the start of the final VF measurement time,referred to as tSW .2.11 tSW  sample window time du ring which finalVF measurement is made; applicable only if tMDdefinition 2.10.2 is used.2.12 K  the temperature-sensitive parametertemperature coefficient measured at IM in \xb0C permillivolt.2.13 CU  the comparison unit con sisting of V Fdivided by I H , that is used to normalize the transientthermal response for variations in power dissipation; inunits of mV/A.2.14 TJ  the device-under-test jun ction temperature.2.15 TJ  the change in T J caused by the applicationof P H for a time equal to tH ."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 25 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI G46-88 \xa9 SEMI 1988 2 2.16   the standard deviation if the V F results fora given test condition.2.17 CU  the standard deviation o f the CU resultsfor a given test condition. 3 Test OperationThe following paragraphs describe in conceptual detailthe operation of the test for integrated circuit thermalresponse.3.1 Set-Up  Shown in Figure 1 i s the set-up requiredfor testing either active devices or thermal test chips.Figure 1a is used for those cases in which the TSP is thejunction isolation diode forward biased voltage.Thermal test chips and test ICs for which the junctionisolation diode is either not available, or desirable fortemperature sensing, can be handled by the set-upshown in Figure 1b.3.2 Apparatus  To implement ei ther version ofFigure 1 requires the following apparatus:3.2.1 A constant voltage source capa ble of adjustmentto the desired value of VH and able to supply the I Hvalue drawn by the DUT.3.2.2 A constant current source to su pply I M withsufficient voltage compliance to turn the TSP junctionfully on.3.2.3 An electronic switch capable o f switchingbetween the heating period conditions and measurementconditions in a time frame short enough to avoid DUTcooling during the transition; this typically requiresswitching in the microsecond range.3.2.4 A voltage measurement circuit capable ofaccurately making the VH measurement within the tMD(or tMD plus tSW , depending on the definitions statedpreviously) time frame with millivolt resolution.3.3 Operation and Waveforms  The test begins withthe adjustment of I M and V H to the desired values. Thenwith the electronic switch in position 1, the value of VFis measured. The switch is then moved to position 2 fora length of time equal to tH and the value of I H ismeasured. Finally, at the conclusion of tH , the switch isagain moved to position 1 and the VF value is measuredwithin a time period defined by tMD (or tMD plus tSW ,depending on the definitions stated previously). Thevoltage and current sources are then turned off at thecompletion of the test.The voltage and current waveforms for the two versionsof Figure 1 are shown in Figure 2. 4 Test ProcedureThe procedures below describe how to set up the testconditions and determine the acceptance limits forimplementing the transient thermal test for dieattachment evaluation using the apparatus anddefinitions stated above.4.1 Initial Device Testing Procedu re  The followingsteps describe in detail how to set up the apparatusdescribed previously for proper testing of variousintegrated circuit devices.Step 1  From a 10 to 15 piece sample of theintegrated circuits to be tested, pick any one device tostart the set-up process. Set up the test apparatus asfollows:V H = 5.0 V (Or some other desired value near thedevice under tests (DUTs) normal operatingvoltage.)tH = 200 mstMD = 15 usI M = 1.0 mA (Or some other value appropriate forthe specific device under test; typically in the rangeof 80 uA to 9.9 mA.) Step 2  Insert device into the apparatus test fixtureand initiate a test.(For best results, a test fixture that offers some form ofheat sinking would be desirable.)Step 3  If V F is in the 20 to 40 mV range, thenproceed to the next step. This range corresponds to ajunction temperature change of roughly 10\xb0C to 20\xb0Cand is sufficient for initial comparison purposes.If V F is less than 20 mV, return to Step 1 and increaseheating power into device by increasing VH , or byreconfiguring the DUT connections for greater powerdissipation, or a combination of both.If V F is greater than 80 mV, corresponding to a junc-tion temperature change greater than 40\xb0C, it wouldprobably be desirable to reduce the heating power byreturning to Step 1 and reducing VH , or byreconfiguring the DUT connections to reduce powerdissipation, or a combination of the two. Reducing VHis the preferable approach.Because two different devices can show the same risein junction temperature, even if the value of P H isdifferent, a comparison of the devices is bestaccomplished using the CU value. As defined inSection 2 above, CU provides a comparison unit thattakes into account different device I H values for a givenV H test condition."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 26 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI G46-88 \xa9 SEMI 19883 Step 4  Test each of the sample devices and recordthe V F and CU data as shown in Figure 3.Step 5  Select out the devices with the highest andlowest values of CU and put the remaining devicesaside.The V F values can be used instead of CU if the mea-sured values of I H are very tightly grouped aroung theaverage value.Step 6  Following the Heating Time (tH ) sequenceshown in Figure 4, read and record the V F and CUdata values for each of the two devices of Step 5.Step 7  Using the data from the previous step,prepare heating curves for the two devices in a mannersimilar to the examples shown in Figure 5.Step 8  Interpretation of the heating curves is the nextstep. Realizing that the thermal characteristics ofidentical chips should be the same if the heating time(tH ) is less than or equal to the thermal time constant ofthe chip, the two curves should start out the same forthe low values of tH . Non-identical chips (i.e., thinner orsmaller in cross section) will have completely differentcurves, even at the smaller values of tH . As the value oftH is increased, thereby overcoming the chip thermalconstant, heat will have propagated through the chipinto the die attachment region. Since the heating curvedevices of Step 5 were specifically chosen for theirdifference, the curves of Figure 5 diverge after tHreaches a value where the die attachment variance hasan effect on the device junction temperature. IncreasingtH further will probably result in a flattening of thecurve as the heating propagates in the device package.If the device package has little thermal mass and/or isnot well mounted to a good heat sink, the curve will notflatten very much, but will show a definite change inslope. Figure 6 shows the key elements of the heatingcurve.Step 9  Using the heating curve, select theappropriate value of tH to correspond to the inflectionpoint in the transition region between heat in the chipand heat in the package.If there are several different elements in the heat flowpath-chip, die attachment, substrate, substrateattachment, and package, for example, in a hybrid therewill be several plateaus and transitions in the heatingcurve. Appropriate selection of tH will optimizeevaluation sensitivity to other attachment areas.Step 10  Return to the apparatus and set tH equal tothe value determined from Step 9. Step 11  Because the selected value of tH is much lessthan that for thermal equilibrium, it is possible tosignificantly increase the heating power withoutdegrading or destroying the device. The increasedpower dissipation within the device under test willresult in high V F and/or CU values that will makedetermination of acceptable and non-acceptable devicesmuch easier.Step 12  The pass/fail limit, the cutoff point betweenacceptable and non-acceptable devices, can beestablished in a variety of ways:a) Correlation to other die attachment evaluationmethods, such as die shear and/or x-ray; while thesetwo methods have little actual value from a thermalpoint of view, they do represent standardized methodsas described in MIL-STD specifications.b) Maximum allowable junction temperature variationbetween devices; since the relationship between T Jand V F is about 0.5\xb0C/mV, the junction temperaturespread between devicescan be easily determined. TheT J predicts reliability. Conversely, the T J spread neces-sary to meet the reliability projections can be translatedto a V F and/or CU value for a Pass/Fail criteria, basedon correlation with steady-state thermal equilibriumconditions.To fully use this approach, it will be necessary tocalibrate the devices for the exact value of the T J - V Fcharacteristic. The characteristics slope, commonlyreferred to as K Factor, is easily measured on a samplebasis using a voltmeter, environmental chamber,temperature indicator and a power supply setup forforcing, both active devices and thermal test chips asshown in Figure 7. A simple set of equations yields thejunction temperature once K and V F are known:T j = | (K) (V F) |T J = T A + T jWhere T A is the ambient or reference temperature.c) Statistically from a moderate size device sample; thedistribution of V F or CU values should be a normalone with defective devices out of the normal range.Figure 8 shows a V F distribution for a sample lot ofintegrated ciruits. Note that the left-hand side of thehistogram envelope is fairly well-defined, but the otherside is greatly skewed to the right. This comes aboutbecause the left-hand side is constrained by theabsolutely best heat flow that can be obtained with agiven chip assembly material and process.

The statistical data required is obtained by testing 40 ormore devices under the conditions of Step 11.Step 13  Once the test conditions and pass/fail limithave been determined, it is necessary only to record thisinformation for future testing requirements of the samedevice in the same package. With the apparatusproperly set-up, including the fail limit selector onthose apparatus set ups so equipped, the operator needonly insert the device, initiate a test, and then eitherread the VF or CU display or observe the appropriatepass or fail indicaors.The steps listed hereto have been convenientlysummarized in Figure 9. The total time required toperform these steps is greatly dependent on the operatorbut, in general, should require about one hour if thestatistical approach of Step 12.C is used.4.2 Routine Device Testing Proced ure  Once theproper control settings have been determined for aparticular device type from a given manufacturingprocess or vendor, repeated testing of that device typesimply requires that the same test conditions be used aspreviously determined.New device types or the same devices manufacturedwith a different process will require a repeat of Section4.1.4.3 Comparison of Different Vend or Devices  Eachdevice type is defined as a specific chip manufacturedto a given set of procedures. Integrated circuit userswho buy a specific part number from more than onevendor or manufacturers that redesign or otherwisemodify the fabrication of their devices will be able touse the heating power and approximately the same tHfor all vendors, but probably will have to use a differentVF or CU pass/fail limit for each different vendorbecause the K Factor for parts manufactured bydifferent vendors will probably be different.

Overcutting causes shoulderintrusions. Undercutting leaves shoulder protrusions. In somecases, an adjacent protrusion and intrusion is caused bymisalignment of the part at the time of dambar removal.5.15 Package Warpage  (Figure 5)5.15.1 Equipment  Microscope Z Axis reading40.5.15.2 With the package sitting on the stage, obtain atwo point datum by measuring two-points on oppositeedges 0.005 from the radius readings; move to thecenter of the package and obtain the deviation from thedatum, and read and record the reading as the warp.5.15.3 For quad packages, it is equally important thatthere be minimum warp in each axis (X or Y) so that athree-point Z axis datum must be obtained; the twoused in 5.15.2 and an additional one, on one adjacentedge.5.16 Lead CoplanarityNOTE: Applies to all surface mount devices.5.16.1 Contact Method  (Figure 6)NOTE: Not recommended for gull-wing leads.5.16.1.1 EquipmentDial Indicator 0.0001"Accuracy, 5 grams maximumpressure.Granite Flat.Transfer Stand.Package Holding Fixture.Reference Gauge Blocks, 0.0002" Accuracy. 5.16.1.2 Place the package on holding fixture so thatthe flat sections of the leads, as they exit from theplastic, are on the ground flats of the fixture. The leadsare to be facing UP (Dead Bug). 5.16.1.3 On the granite flat, set up the dial indicator onits transfer stand and zero the reading using thereference block. Use a suitable reference block so thatall measurements are positive to avoid confusion.5.16.1.4 Measure the highest point on each lead (e.g.,the tangent point of a J lead).5.16.1.5 Determine the range of readings.NOTE: Special Precautions1. Be sure that the flat of the leadframe, as it exitsfrom the plastic, rests on the flats of the holdingfixture. If the radiused section supports the package,then spurious readings will result.2. The pressure exerted by the dial indicator must notexceed 5 grams. To check the contact pressure ofthe dial indicator, use a gram gauge. The grampressure must be noted at the initial deflection of thegauge and at the maximum deflection of the gauge.If the initial deflection is greater than 5 grams, thenthe point where 5 grams is obtained must be notedand the measurement must stay within this range tobe valid. 5.16.2 Comparator/Mirror Method5.16.2.1 Equipment  Optical comparator with at least20 magnification as per Section 3.1.2.
