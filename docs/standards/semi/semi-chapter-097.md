9  Analytical Procedures for Grade 4.7 Nitrous Oxide (See Appendix 1)
NOTE 1:  Rapid  withdrawal  of  gaseous  nitrous  oxide  from  a  liquified  source  (e.g.,  cylinder)  can  result  in  a  significant  cooling
effect which may condense the nitrous oxide in the sampling lines.
9. 1  Ammonia — This procedure is for the determination of ammonia in nitrous oxide using an apparatus employing
a detector tube filled with a color-reactive chemical.
9. 1.1  Detection Limit — 0.2 ppm (mol/mol).
9. 1.2  Apparatus
9. 1.2.1  Pressure Regulator — Outlet Pressure Range 0–30 psig.
9. 1.2.2  Flowmeter — Range 0–200 mL/min.
9. 1.2.3  Detector Tube — Range 2–30 ppm.


SEMI C60-0305 © SEMI 2005 3
9. 1.2.4  Stop watch.
9. 1.2.5  6 mm (1/4 in) flexible tubing.
9. 1.3  Operating Procedure
9. 1.3.1  Attach a suitable regulator to the cylinder outlet.
9. 1.3.2  Connect the flowmeter to the regulator using flexible tubing.
9. 1.3.3  Open the cylinder valve and purge the flowmeter with nitrous oxide.
9. 1.3.4  After the line is thoroughly purged, stop the flow of nitrous oxide and attach the detector tube to the outlet
of the flowmeter.
9. 1.3.5  Start  the  flow  of  nitrous  oxide  and  set  the  flow  rate  to  100  mL/min.    The  pressure  and  temperature  of  the
sample must be within the tolerances specified by the manufacturer.
9. 1.3.6  Pass 100 mL of nitrous oxide through the detector tube.
9. 1.3.7  Determine  the  concentration  of  ammonia  according  to  the  detector  tube  manufacturer’s  instructions.    The
concentration may not exceed the specification in Table 1 of this standard.
9. 2  Carbon  Monoxide  and  Carbon  Dioxide  —  This  procedure  is  for  the  determination  of  carbon  monoxide  and
carbon  dioxide  in  nitrous  oxide  using  a  gas  chromatograph  with  a  flame  ionization  detector  and  methanizer  with
back flush, (see Figure A1-1).
NOTE 2:  In  order  to  prevent  nitrous  oxide  interference,  a  helium  backflush  to  vent  is  needed  for  3–5  times  the  analysis  time
(estimated to be 3–5 minutes).  Because nitrous oxide is converted into ammonia in the methanizer, stainless steel (ss) is required;
copper tubing and fittings are not used.  The backflush removes the nitrous oxide from Column No. 1 preparing the column for
the  next  sample.    Careful  timing  is  required  to  identify  carbon  monoxide  and  carbon  dioxide  distinguishing  both  from  the  time
methane would appear, if present.  Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are converted to methane in the methanizer; therefore,
both will be detected by the FID detector at the specific times determined by the analytical sequence of the standard.

Methanizer                                                  500°C

9. 2.3  Calibration  Standard  —  1–5  ppm  (mol/mol)  carbon  monoxide,  1–5  ppm  (mol/mol)  carbon  dioxide,  balance
nitrous oxide.
9. 2.4  Operating Procedure
9. 2.4.1  Inject the calibration standard into the column using a gas sampling valve.  Record the retention times and
peak  areas.    The  order  of  elution  is  carbon  monoxide,  methane,  carbon  dioxide,  and  nitrous  oxide.  Back  flush  18
minutes.
9. 2.4.2  Inject  the  sample  to  be  tested  in  same  manner  as  the  calibration  standard.    Record  the  retention  times  and
peak areas.

1  Purpose
1. 1  Monocrystalline (single crystal) silicon wafers are utilized for essentially all integrated circuits and many other
semiconductor devices.  To permit common processing equipment to be used in multiple device fabrication lines, it
is essential for the wafer dimensions to be standardized.
1. 2   In  addition,  as  technology  advances  to  smaller  and  smaller  dimensions  for  the  elements  of  high  density
integrated circuits, it has become of interest to standardize additional properties of the wafers.
1. 3  This specification provides the essential dimensional and certain other common characteristics of silicon wafers,
including polished wafers as well as substrates for epitaxial and certain other kinds of silicon wafers.
2  Scope
2. 1   These  specifications  cover  ordering  information  and  certain  requirements  for  high-purity,  monocrystalline
polished  silicon  wafers  used  in  semiconductor  device  and  integrated  circuit  manufacturing  or  as  substrates  (or
starting wafers) for other kinds of wafers, including epitaxial, annealed, and SOI wafers.
2. 2  Dimensional requirements are provided for the following categories of polished wafers:
• Category 1.1 2 in. polished monocrystalline silicon wafers with secondary flat
• Category 1.2 3 in. polished monocrystalline silicon wafers with secondary flat
• Category 1.5 100 mm polished monocrystalline silicon wafers, 525 μm thick, with secondary flat
• Category 1.6 100 mm polished monocrystalline silicon wafers, 625 μm thick, with secondary flat
• Category 1.7 125 mm polished monocrystalline silicon wafers with secondary flat
• Category 1.8.1 150 mm polished monocrystalline silicon wafers with secondary flat and T/3 edge profile

• Category  1.10.1  200  mm  flatted  polished  monocrystalline  silicon  wafers  with  T/3  edge  profile  template
without secondary flat
• Category  1.10.2  200  mm  flatted  polished  monocrystalline  silicon  wafers  with  T/4  edge  profile  template
without secondary flat
• Category 1.11 100 mm flatted polished monocrystalline silicon wafers without secondary flat
• Category 1.12 125 mm flatted polished monocrystalline silicon wafers without secondary flat
• Category  1.13.1  150  mm  flatted  polished  monocrystalline  silicon  wafers  with  T/3  edge  profile  template
without secondary flat

without secondary flat
• Category 1.15 300 mm notched polished monocrystalline silicon wafers
2. 2.1   Values  given  for  thickness,  TTV,  bow,  and  warp  apply  only  to  wafers  prior  to  application  of  back  surface
films, extrinsic gettering treatments, or other thermal treatments.
2. 2.2  The dimensional characteristics of Category 1.10.1, 1.10.2, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13.1, and 1.13.2 wafers specified in
this document are identical with those specified in JEITA EM-3602, and the dimensional characteristics of Category
1. 15 wafers are essentially equivalent with those specified in JEITA EM-3602.


SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 4
2. 3   A  complete  purchase  specification  requires  that  additional  physical  properties  be  specified  along  with  test
methods  suitable  for  determining  their  magnitude.    This  standard  provides  a  comprehensive  listing  of  such
properties  and  associated  test  methods.    This  listing  provides  a  systematic  basis  for  constructing  the  purchase
specification for any kind of polished silicon wafer or substrate and is expected to be used for such purposes.
2. 4   These  specifications  apply  specifically  to  prime  silicon  wafers  with  at  least  one  chem-mechanically  polished
surface.    Ground,  lapped,  and  unpolished  wafers  are  not  covered  in  this  specification  but  this  specification  may
provide guidance in connection with their procurement.
2. 5   In  addition,  these  specifications  cover  specification  requirements  for  basic  300  mm  diameter,  double-side
polished  silicon  wafers  that  are  suitable  for  many  advanced  integrated  circuit  applications.    If  this  kind  of  wafer  is
desired, physical properties other than those listed in the table of requirements shall not be included in the purchase
specification.
2. 6  These specifications do not cover the requirements for the following related silicon materials and wafers:
• Polycrystalline silicon (see SEMI M16 or JEITA EM-3601),
• Epitaxial wafers (see SEMI M2 or SEMI M11),
• Epitaxial wafers with buried layer (see SEMI M18),
• Test wafers (see SEMI M8),
• Premium wafers (see SEMI M24),
• Reclaimed wafers (see SEMI M38),
• Annealed wafers (see SEMI M57),
• SOI wafers (see SEMI M34, SEMI M41, SEMI M47, or JEITA EM-3603),
• Dielectrically isolated wafers (see SEMI M22), and
• Solar-grade silicon wafers (see SEMI M6).
They do, however, provide the ordering information for test, premium, and reclaimed wafers, as well as the ordering
information for the polished substrates and starting wafers used to prepare epitaxial, annealed, and SOI wafers.
2. 7   The  complete  EDI  Code  List  for  items  in  the  Order  Form  appropriate  to  silicon  wafers,  including  polished
wafers and substrates, can be found in SEMI M18.
2. 8  For referee purposes, U.S. customary units shall be used for wafers of 2 in. and 3 in. nominal diameters, and SI
(system international, commonly called metric) units for 100 mm and larger diameter wafers.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.

4  Terminology
4. 1  Terms and acronyms associated with silicon wafers and silicon technology are listed and defined in SEMI M59.
5  Ordering Information
5. 1  Purchase orders for silicon wafers furnished to this specification shall include the following items.  These items
are indicated on the Silicon Wafer Specification Format for Order Entry, Parts 1 and 2, shown in Table 1 with a ♦
symbol in the left-most column.
5. 1.1  Growth Method.
5. 1.2  Crystal Orientation.
5. 1.3  Conductivity type.
5. 1.4  Dopant.
5. 1.5  Wafer surface orientation.
5. 1.6  Resistivity.
5. 1.7  Diameter.
5. 1.8  Fiducial dimensions and orientation.
5. 1.9  Edge profile.
5. 1.10  Thickness and tolerance.
5. 2   In  addition,  the  purchase  order  must  indicate  the  test  method  to  be  used  in  evaluating  each  of  those  items  for
which alternate test procedures exist.
5. 3  The following items must also be included in the purchase order:

5. 3.1  Lot acceptance procedures.
5. 3.2  Certification (if required).
5. 3.3  Packing and shipping container labeling requirements.
5. 4  Finally, many other characteristics may be specified in purchase orders for silicon wafers.
5. 4.1  These shall be selected from the other items listed in the Silicon Wafer Specification Format for Order Entry,
Parts 1 and 2 (see Table 1).
5. 4.1.1  The parameter values provided in the requirements tables in §6 may be used to identify appropriate values in
the specification without selecting a value for each line.  However, even if these requirements table values are used,
the desired test methodology must be selected in accordance with ¶5.2.
5. 4.2  It is essential that all choices for the items selected to be specified be made in order not to have unspecified
parameters  that  would  lead  to  surprises  between  supplier  and  customer.    This  is  particularly  important  in  the
specification of wafer site flatness, for which a variety of parameters must be selected as outlined in Appendix 1.
5. 4.3  Of the various items listed, the following (listed in the order in which they appear in Table 1) are most often
selected, especially for wafers to be used for advanced integrated circuit manufacture:
• nominal edge exclusion (to define the fixed quality area),
• structural characteristics,
• wafer ID marking,
• total thickness variation (TTV or GBIR),
• warp (and sometimes bow or sori),
• site flatness (SFQR), and
• localized light scatterers (LLS).
6  Requirements
6. 1  General Characteristics
6. 1.1   The  crystal  growth  method  shall  be  modified  Czochralski  (Cz),  float  zone  (FZ),  or  magnetic  Czochralski
(MCz) as specified on the purchase order.  In some cases, the supplier is given the option of selecting Cz or MCz.
6. 1.1.1   If  the  Cz  or  MCz  method  is  used  for  crystal  growth,  it  may  be  permissible  to  utilize  refined  (previously
melted) polysilicon in the growth charge; when this is the case, the appropriate box should be checked..
6. 1.2  The crystal orientation shall be as specified on the purchase order.  Usually either (100) or (111) is specified,
but  (110)  is  sometimes  specified  for  polished  wafers  to  be  used  for  making  SOI  wafers.    Occasionally,  another
orientation, such as (311) or (511), is specified.
6. 1.3  The conductivity type shall be either n or p.
6. 1.4   The  dopant  shall  be  specified  to  match  the  conductivity  type.    In  general,  boron  (B)  is  used  for  p-type
material, while phosphorus (P) is most commonly used for n-type material.  For some applications, antimony (Sb) or
arsenic  (As)  are  used  to  obtain
n-type  wafers.    For  high  power  applications,  neutron  transmutation  doping  is  often
used to obtain high resistivity n-type wafers.
6. 1.5  The nominal edge exclusion, EE, specifies the diameter of the fixed quality area (FQA), which is given by the
nominal diameter minus 2·EE (see Figure 1).  This quantity provides a center-referenced property.

The nominal edge exclusion,
EE
, specifies the diameter of the FQA, which is give
n by the nominal diameter (see Item 2-6.1) minus 2
EE
(see Figure 1).  This quantity provides a center referenced
property.    Although  use  of  edge  referenced
properties  is  discouraged,  some  equipments
and  procedures  are  based  on  edge  referenc
ed  dimensions.    When  this  occurs
,  the  quality  area  is  not  fixed  and
some part of the fixed quality area may fall outside the eval
uated area, which is generally not a desirable situation.
#2
If specified as polished, this term is meant to imply a
surface condition and not a particular
processing technique.  If desi
red, a quantitative measure of surface fi
nish may optionally be indicated by
specifying  the  rms  microroughness  over  a  specifi
ed  spatial  frequency  (or  wa
velength)  range.    Because  a  standardized  test  method
has  not  yet  been  developed  for  th
is  metric,  both  values  and  test
procedures, including sampling plan and
detrending procedures, shall be agr
eed upon between supplier and customer.
#3
Flatness Acronyms are defined in the
Flatness Decision Tree in Appendix 1.
#4
In today’s technology, it may be possible to inspect for some
of these items using automated surface scanning inspection syst
ems (SSIS).  Such systems should be calibrated according to SEMI M53
using polystyrene latex spheres deposited in
accordance with SEMI M58.  Some indicati
on of the defects separable by such instru
ments is provided in SEMI M35; howev
er, a standard test procedure has
yet to be developed.  Application of au
tomated inspection with the use of an SSIS
must be agreed upon between supplier and cust
omer.

SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 19
6. 1.5.1  This quantity is usually specified as 2 mm or 3 mm, but some advanced wafer processing technologies are
moving  in  the  direction  of  1  mm.    However,  it  should  be  noted  that  not  all  processes  and  metrology  can  work  as
close to the wafer edge as implied by the nominal edge exclusion.
6. 1.5.2   In  addition,  it  is  sometimes  necessary  to  specify  additional  exclusion  zones,  such  as  those  for  wafer
identification marks or wafer holding areas.
6. 1.5.3   Although  use  of  edge  referenced  properties  is  discouraged,  some  equipments  and  procedures  are  based  on
edge referenced dimensions.  When this occurs, the quality area is not fixed and some part of the fixed quality area
may fall outside the evaluated area, which is generally not a desirable situation.
6. 1.6   A  co-dopant  may  be  required  for  polished  wafers  intended  to  be  processed  into  annealed  wafers.    Some  co-
dopants may also be used in connection with control of oxygen precipitation characteristics even when the wafer is
not annealed.
6. 1.7  Wafer Surface Orientation — The wafer shall conform to the surface orientation as specified in the purchase
order.
6. 1.7.1   For  on-orientation  wafers,  the  angular  tolerance  from  the  plane  perpendicular  to  the  growth  axis  shall  be
specified.
6. 1.7.2 For off-orientation wafers, both the misorientation angle from the growth axis and its angular tolerance shall
be specified.
6. 1.7.2.1  A misorientation angle between 0.2° and 1.0° (0.6° ± 0.4°) from a (100) plane is frequently used for some
epitaxial substrates.
6. 1.7.2.2   A  misorientation  angle  of  2.50°  or  4.00° ±  0.5°  from  a  (111)  plane  is  often  used  for  other  epitaxial
substrates.
6. 1.7.3   Orthogonal  misorientation  is  the  tilt  angle  of  the  normal  to  a  (111)  wafer  surface  toward  nearest  <110>
direction in a plane parallel with the primary flat as indicated in Figure 2.

NOTE: If the off-orientation angle is determined with the seed end up, the polished surface of the finished
wafer must be the surface toward the seed end, and vice versa.  Polishing of the incorrect wafer surface
results in an incorrect wafer tilt, which can cause unwanted pattern shifts and distortions if the wafer is used
subsequently for epitaxial layer growth.  Because the convention for determining the off-orientation angle is
not the same worldwide, it is essential to establish accurately the desired convention.
Figure 2
Orthogonal Misorientation of {111} Wafer
6. 1.7.3.1 The contribution of 5° of orthogonal misorientation to the total off-orientation angle is less than 0.5°.
6. 1.7.4  For ion implant applications, the following tolerance issues should be considered:
6. 1.7.4.1   For  general  use  where  channeling  is  to  be  avoided,  the  current  wafer  orientation  specification  of  ±1.0°
deviation  from  the  [100]  axis  (perpendicular  to  the  (100)  plane  of  the  wafer)  is  adequate.    This  specification  is
suitable  for  minimum  channeling  applications,  provided  that  the  appropriate  ion  implant  equipment  angle  settings
are employed.


SEMI M1-0305 © SEMI 1978, 2005 20
6. 1.7.4.2 Uniform,  maximum  channeling  along  the  [100]  axis  perpendicular  to  the  (100)  wafer  surface  is  strongly
dependent  on  strict  adherence  to  a  0°  tilt  angle.    To  achieve  maximum  channeling,  crystallography  requires  the
orientation  to  be  within  ±0.1°  of  a  <100>  direction.    Also,  the  customer  must  remove  all  overlying  oxide,  nitride,
poly, etc., layers from the wafer prior to a channeling implant.  The customer must maintain very rigid control of the
ion implant equipment angle setting in order to achieve maximum channeling across the wafer.
6. 1.7.5   The  tolerance  of  ±0.1°  is  derived  from  experimental  ion  implant  profile  data  and  ion  implant  modeling
activity for implants into (100) silicon wafers. The ranges for which data was obtained are given in Table 2.
6. 2  Electrical Characteristics
6. 2.1  The center-point room temperature resistivity of the
wafers shall conform to the nominal and tolerance values
specified on the purchase order.
6. 2.2    The   wafers   shall   conform   to   any   requirements
specified   on   the   purchase   order   for   radial   resistivity
variation,    resistivity    striations    and    minority    carrier
lifetime.
6. 3  Chemical Characteristics
6. 3.1  The wafers shall conform to any requirements specified on the purchase order for oxygen concentration, radial
oxygen  variation,  carbon  concentration,  and,  for  heavily  doped  (low  resistivity)  n-type  silicon  wafers  only,
compensating boron concentration.
6. 4  Structural Characteristics
6. 4.1  The wafers shall conform to any requirements specified on the purchase order for dislocation etch pit density,
slip,  lineage,  twin,  swirl,  shallow  pits,  oxidation  induced  stacking  faults  (OSF),  oxide  precipitates  or  bulk
microdefects  (BMD),  interstitial  oxygen  reduction  upon  appropriate  heat  treatment,  and  bulk  defects  by  X-ray
topoography.
6. 5  Wafer Preparation Characteristics
6. 5.1  Wafer ID Marking—Where wafer ID marking is specified on the purchase order, the kind of marking must be
indicated.
6. 5.1.1   Where  alphanumeric  marking  is  specified  for  wafers  of  200  mm  diameter  and  smaller,  the  code  character
properties and code field location shall conform either to SEMI M13 or to SEMI M12, as specified on the purchase
order.
6. 5.1.2   Where  back-surface  bar  code  marking  is  specified  for  wafers  of  200  mm  diameter  and  smaller,  the  code
symbol and its location shall conform to SEMI T1.
6. 5.1.3   Where  two-dimensional  matrix  code  marking  is  specified  for  wafers  of  200  mm  diameter  and  smaller,  the
code symbol and its location shall conform to SEMI T2.
6. 5.1.4   All  300  mm  diameter  wafers  (wafer  category  1.15,  see  Table  9)  shall  be  marked  with  a  two-dimensional
matrix code symbol on the back surface outside the fixed quality area as soon after slicing as practical in the manner
specified in SEMI T7 in order to provide both identification of these wafers and traceability of each wafer back to
the ingot from which it was cut.  The back surface is identified as the wafer surface with the two-dimensional matrix
code symbol.
6. 5.1.4.1   Optionally,  the  user  may  specify  an  additional  back-surface  mark

as  shown  in  Figure  3.    This  mark
contains alphanumeric characters with:
• The same message characters as the SEMI T7 mark and appropriate checksum characters as defined by SEMI
M12 and
• Character string as specified in SEMI M12.
NOTE 1:  It is expected that this optional alphanumeric mark will not be used after users have developed successful experience
with SEMI T7 mark usage.

NOTE: A/N mark field dimensions are defined by the centers of the topmost and bottommost dot rows and
the center of the leftmost and rightmost dot columns of the A/N characters.  The field dimensions are more
tightly controlled than those of a field constructed using SEMI M12.  This results from the availability of
laser marking capabilities not available when SEMI M12 was developed.  In addition, the tolerance on the
field dimensions is not cumulative.
Figure 3
Optional A/N Code Field Location on Back Surface of Notched 300 mm Diameter Wafer (Category 1.15)
NOTE 2: The overall length tolerance of the A/N mark is more stringent than that in SEMI M12.  Also the height tolerance of the
overall mark imposes tighter skew and offset tolerances than are required in SEMI M12.
6. 5.1.4.8   The  mark-field  shall  be  centered  on  the  radius  that  passes  through  the  reference  point  of  the  SEMI  T7
mark as shown in Figure 3.
6. 5.1.4.9  Character baseline shall be toward wafer OD and parallel with the row of the SEMI T7 mark that contains
that mark’s reference point.
6. 5.2  Other  —  The  wafers  shall  conform  to  any  requirements  specified  on  the  purchase  order  for  any  other  wafer
preparation characteristics including front surface thin films, denuded zone, extrinsic gettering, backseal, annealing,
and edge and back surface conditions.

6. 6  Dimensional Characteristics
6. 6.1  Dimensions  and  Fiducials  —  The  wafers  shall  conform  to  the  dimensions,  dimensional  tolerances,  and
fiducial (flat or notch) characteristics and locations as specified in the purchase order.
6. 6.1.1  Where secondary flats are specified, they shall be located as shown in Figure 4.
6. 6.1.2  Where notches are specified, they shall conform to the dimensions in Figure 5.
6. 6.2  Edge  Profile  —  The  edge  profile  of  edge-profiled  wafers  shall  conform  to  the  following  requirements  at  all
points on the wafer periphery (except interior portions of notches, if present).
6. 6.2.1   The  SEMI  Wafer  Edge  Profile  Template  is  shown  in  Figure  6.    There  are  two  sets  of  dimensions  for  the
template:  T/3  and  T/4,  where  T  is  the  nominal  thickness  of  the  wafer  (see  Tables  4  through  9  for  values  of  the
nominal thickness for various wafer categories).

NOTE 1: Secondary flat location for 150 mm diameter (100) n-type wafers changed from configuration c to configuration d
effective January 1, 1990.
NOTE 2: The angular position of the center point of the secondary flat is given in Tables 4 through 6 both in terms of the
clockwise angle from the primary flat, located at the bottom of each figure, to the secondary flat and the angle,
θ, from the
positive x-axis of the wafer coordinate system as defined by SEMI M20 (at 3 o’clock) to the secondary flat.

NOTE: The pin shown in the outline on this figure is used to align the notched wafer in a fixture during
use.  The pin is also used to reference the notched wafer during testing for notch dimensions and
dimensional tolerances.  The notch dimensions shown in the figure assume a 3 mm diameter for this
alignment pin.
Figure 5
Notch Dimensions


NOTE 1: The figure is not to scale
NOTE 2: Only one-half of the template is shown; the wafer surface is aligned with the x-axis, and the outermost radial portion of
the edge contour is aligned with the y-axis.  The template in this figure is not intended for use in measuring wafer thickness.
NOTE 3: Constant radius profile with blended, tangential front and back surface intercepts is preferred for ease of manufacture
and reduced particle and chip generation.
NOTE 4: The x- and y-axes in this template do not correspond with the x- and y-axes in the wafer coordinate system defined in
SEMI M20.

For referee purposes, U.S. Customary units are to be used for 2 and 3 in. diameter wafers SI units are to be used for all other wafers.

For the value of this coordinate, see the specifications for the appropriate wafer category in Tables 4 through 9.
6. 6.2.2   The  coordinates  for  the  two  templates  are  given  in  Table  3.    Note  that  this  coordinate  system  differs  from
that in SEMI M20 in that the origin is at the wafer edge instead of the wafer center and the y-axis is positive in the
downward  direction  toward  the  wafer  median  plane  instead  of  being  in  the  plane  of  the  wafer  surface.    If  the
nominal edge exclusion, EE, is 1 mm or greater, the edge profile will not extend into  the fixed quality area.
6. 6.2.3  When the wafer is aligned with the Template so that the x-axis of the template is coincident with the wafer
surface  and  the  y-axis  of  the  template  is  tangent  with  the  outermost  radial  portion  of  the  profile,  the  wafer  edge
profile  must  be  contained  within  the  clear  region  of  the  template.    (See  Figure  7  for  examples  of  acceptable  and
unacceptable edge profiles.)
6. 6.2.4  No sharp points or protrusions are permitted anywhere on the wafer edge profile.
6. 6.2.5  Cosmetic attributes of the edge profile are not covered by this specification.  They shall be agreed upon
between supplier and customer.

For referee purposes, U.S. Customary units apply.  To ensure that product shipped is within specification, any conversion to metric (SI)
equivalents should be done following the maximum-minimum convention in which the minimum values are rounded-up and the maximum values
are rounded-down to ensure that the equivalent range is always inside the referee range.  If the metric (SI) equivalents are used for incoming
inspection, minimum values should be rounded-down and maximum values rounded-up to avoid rejection of material that is within the
specification when measured by the referee system of units.  CAUTION: The significance of the rightmost digit may vary, depending on the
quantity being measured and the precision of the test procedure.  Refer to the relevant test method for precision data which can be used to
construct appropriate guard bands.
