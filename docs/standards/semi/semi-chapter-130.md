SEMI G77-0699 © SEMI 19991 SEMI G77-0699SPECIFICATION FOR FRAME CASSETTE FOR 300 MM WAFERS This test method was technically approved by the Global Assembly & Packaging Committee and is the directresponsibility of the Japanese Packaging Committee. Current edition approved by the Japanese RegionalStandards Committee on March 17, 1999. Initially available at www.semi.org May 1999; to be publishedJune 1999. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this document is to specify themechanical features for a 300 mm wafer frame cassetteused between the wafer mounting process and the die-bonding process. 2 Scope2.1 This standard is intended to se t an appropriatelevel of specification that places minimal limits oninnovation while ensuring modularity andinterchangeability at all mechanical interfaces.2.2 Only the physical interfaces fo r the frame cassetteare specified; no materials requirements or micro-contamination limits are given. However, thisspecification was written to allow for both metal andplastic frame cassette designs.2.3 This specification defines a 30 0 mm wafer framecassette that is intended for both manual and automatedtransport. The frame cassette has the followingcomponents and sub-components (  indicates anoptional component):2.3.1 Toprobotic handling flange (optional)- top cover 2.3.2 Interior- frame supports for 13 or 25 tape frames- frame restraint 2.3.3 Sideshuman handles (optional) 2.3.4 Rear- rear cover 2.3.5 Bottom- 2 bottom conveyor rails running along thesides of the frame cassette3 features that mate with kinematic couplingpins and provide a 10 mm lead-in (optional)4 frame cassette sending pads (optional) 3 Referenced Documents3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E1.9  Provisional Mechanical Specification forCassettes Used to Transport and Store 300 mm WafersSEMI E15  Specification for Tool Load PortSEMI E47.1  Provisional Mechanical Specificationfor Boxes and Pods Used to Transport and Store 300mm WafersSEMI E57  Provisional Mechanical Specification forKinematic Couplings Used to Align and Support 300mm Wafer CarriersSEMI G74  Specification for Tape Frame for 300mm WafersSEMI S8  Safety Guidelines for Ergonomics/HumanFactors Engineering of Semiconductor ManufacturingEquipment 4 Terminology4.1 bilaterial datum plane a ve rtical plane thatbisects the tape frames and that is perpendicular to boththe horizontal and facial datum planes (as defined inSEMI E57).4.2 conveyor rails parallel surf aces on the bottomof the cassette for supporting the cassette on rollerconveyors.4.3 facial datum plane  a vertica l plane that bisectsthe tape frames and that is parallel to the front side ofthe frame cassette (where tape frames are removed orinserted). On tool load ports, it is also parallel to theload face plane specified in SEMI E15 on the side ofthe tool where the frame cassette is loaded andunloaded (as defined in SEMI E57).4.4 frame cassette  an open stru cture that holds oneor more tape frames.4.5 horizontal datum plane  a ho rizontal plane fromwhich projects the kinematic coupling pins on whichthe frame cassette sits. On tool load ports, it is at theload height specified in SEMI E15 and might not bephysically realized as a surface (as defined in SEMIE57).

SEMI G77-0699 © SEMI 1999 2 4.6 robotic handling flange  hor izontal projectionon the top of the frame cassette for lifting and rotatingthe frame cassette.4.7 tape frame  the frame which applies the wafertape to the wafer and retains the wafer.4.8 wafer tape  an adhesive plas tic tape whichretains the wafer or diced chip. It is used between themounting process and die-bonding process. 5 Ordering Information5.1 Intended use  This documen t is intended tospecify 300 mm wafer frame cassettes over areasonable lifetime of use, not just those in newcondition. For this reason, the purchaser needs tospecify a time period as well as the number and type ofuses to which the frame cassettes will be put. It is underthese conditions that the frame cassettes must remain incompliance with the requirements listed in Section 6. 6 Requirements6.1 Dimensions  The frame cass ette dimensions areshown in Figures 1 through 5 and listed in Table 1. Inall figures, the heaviest lines are used for surfaces thathave tolerances (not surfaces that have only maximumor only minimum dimensions).6.2 Tape Frame Orientation  Th e tape frames mustbe horizontal when the frame cassette is placed on theload port.6.3 Center of Tape Frames  Wh en a tape frame isstored in the frame cassette, the center of the tape frameshould be within the radius of 2 mm from the center ofthe junction of the bilaterial datum plane and the facialdatum plane.6.4 Top and Rear Covers  Both top and rear coversare required. With the covers in place, the framecassette must conform to all dimensions listed in Table1.6.5 Number of Slots  The frame cassette has anoption of either 13 or 25 slots.6.6 Kinematic Couplings (optiona l)  The physicalalignment mechanism from the frame cassette to thetool load port (or a nest on a vehicle or in a stocker)consists of features (not specified in this document) onthe top entity that mate with three or six pinsunderneath as defined in SEMI E57. Most of the dimensions of the frame cassette are determined withrespect to the three orthogonal datum planes defined inthat standard: the Horizontal Datum Plane, the facialdatum plane, and the bilateral datum plane.6.6.1 The three features that mate w ith the pins mustprovide a lead-in capability that corrects a framecassette misalignment of up to 10 mm in any horizontaldirection, although 15 mm is recommended forergonomic reasons. However, it is recommended thatrobotics placing cassettes on kinematic couplings use aslittle of this lead-in capability as possible to avoid wear.6.7 Human Handles (optional)  All handles for useby humans must either be contained within themaximum outer dimensions of the frame cassette, bedetached when not in use, or be retractable into themaximum outer dimensions when not in use. Handlesfor use by humans (if present) must follow SEMI S8and shall require the use of both hands (each using afull wrap-around grip, given the minimum clearancerequirement in SEMI E15.1). Automation handlingfeatures shall not be considered for dual purpose unlessthey are designed to meet SEMI S8.6.8 Robotic Handling Flange (opt ional)  On the topof the frame cassette is an optional robotic handlingflange for manipulating the frame cassette.6.9 Bottom Rails  On the bottom of the framecassette are two rails, one on each side for use withroller conveyors.6.10 Frame Restraint  The frame cassette mustprovide a feature that prevents tape frames fromslipping out of the cassette during transport. The featuremust conform to all dimensions listed in Table 1.6.11 Frame Cassette Sensing Pads (optional) When the cassette is fully down, the frame cassettesensing pads (see Figure 5) must be z2 above thehorizontal datum plane. It is recommended that theareas surrounding all of the frame cassette sensing padsbe designed in conjunction with the features that matewith the kinematic coupling pins so that a mechanicalsensor pin cannot interfere with the lead-in function ofthe kinematic couplings.6.12 Cassette Stacking (optional)  The framecassette may have optional features to allow two 13capacity cassettes to be stacked on top of each other.This option is only available for cassettes without arobotic handling flange.

SEMI G78-0699 © SEMI 19991 SEMI G78-0699TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBESYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS This test method was technically approved by the Global Automated Test Equipment Committee and isthe direct responsibility of the North American Automated Test Equipment Committee. Current editionapproved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on December 18, 1998. Initiallyavailable at www.semi.org April 1999; to be published June 1999.1 Purpose1.1 To define the terms and provid e a means ofcomparative, or relative measurement for the automatedwafer prober functions: Accuracy, Repeatability andThroughput. 2 Scope2.1 This method may be used to ev aluate theperformance of a single automated wafer prober, or as ameans to compare many probers. The probers that thisdocument addresses are defined as fully automated; thatis, having automatic material handling, alignment andprobing capabilities. 3 Limitations3.1 This test and comparison meth od is not intended torepresent a statistically complete methodology formeasuring the performance of an automated waferprober. Its correct use is a practical means to comparethe stepping capabilities of wafer probers within aspecific end users environment.3.2 The definitions of the terms R epeatability andAccuracy as used in this document are not inaccordance with those of the National Conference ofStandards Laboratories (NCSL) nor are they intended tobe. They are to be used solely for the purpose of thisdocument and have no other intended uses.3.3 It is difficult to characterize an d eliminate hightemperature contributions to positional error such asprobe needle float. Therefore, it is stronglyrecommended that the same probe card be used toevaluate all of the probers being considered.3.4 It is recommended that the pro be card is verified tobe in the same condition (i.e. evaluated for positionalaccuracy and overall functional condition) both beforeand after the conclusion of each test.3.5 Bump placement on a semicon ductor device isgenerally located ± 0.001" with respect to their nominallocation. Vertical probe cards used to probe bumpshave an inherent amount of needle drift. Therefore caremust be exercised in using vertical probe cards onbump devices as a means of prober accuracymeasurement. 4 Referenced DocumentsNOTE: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 4.1 SEMI DocumentsSEMI E10  Standard for Definition and Measurementof Equipment Reliability, Availability andMaintainability (RAM)SEMI S2  Safety Guidelines for SemiconductorManufacturing Equipment 5 Terminology5.1 3 limit  a statistically deriv ed measurement ofprocess variation.

In the context of this method, accuracy isdefined as average die offset.5.2.1 Average die offset is the perpe ndicular distancemeasured from the centerline of the die pad to a parallelline that statistically represents the scrub mark datapoint distribution center (see Figure 1). Each data pointshown in this figure represents only the center value ofaccumulated scrub marks produced by operation of thismethod.5.2.2 It should be noted that accurac y established bythis method is characteristic of the system, which intotal represents both the automated prober as well as itsprobe card. Finally, this method establishes twoaccuracy values, a value for pads along the X and Yaxes of the die. These axis directions are arbitrary.5.2.3 It should be noted that if fully automated proberset-up modes are not used for probe-needle-to-padalignment during testing, the possibility of operatorerror should be considered as a variable whenevaluating system accuracy.5.3 automatic wafer prober  dev ice thatautomatically and repeatedly aligns the die bonding

That task force consisted ofmembers from semiconductor wafer probe system usersand wafer probe system suppliers. This method, in parta guide to collection of data, is aimed at a specific set ofwafer probe system parameters: accuracy, repeatabilityand throughput. This method is a tool that createscomparative data. That data will act as a criterion bywhich multiple wafer probe systems can be judgedcompetitively.6.2 Probe System Accuracy and T hroughput  A waferprobe system will have needle placement error due tothe probe system electromechanical systems, andadditional needle placement error due to the probe cardphysical alignment of the needles. The degree ofaccuracy to which the probe system can place thechuck, the effectiveness of the probe system's bond padto needle alignment, the physical alignment of theprobe card needles in their X and Y plane, and theprobe system's vision resolution and accuracy (xmicrons of distance per pixel) will be the factors thatinfluence a probe system's overall placementperformance.6.2.1 Probe system comparative acc uracy andrepeatability are established in this method using probemark data acquired manually with a vision system or, ifavailable, through use of an automated probe mark dataanalysis system. Acquired data is analyzed with theProbe Mark Data Analysis algorithm contained in thismethod.6.2.1.1 The intention of this data colle ction exercise isnot to make a deterministic conclusion establishing aprobe systems accuracy. Data analysis results are onlymeaningful in the context of a comparative analysis ofmultiple probe systems.6.2.2 Probe system throughput is be st determinedusing time measurements made using a stopwatch.Other approaches can be applied, such as: the time stamp and log file (if available) on theprobe system under evaluation. time tracking within the device test programemployed for testing the prober.6.2.3 Any of these approaches is via ble for measuringtime intervals during probe system operation. That data

SEMI G78-0699 © SEMI 1999 4 is to be entered into the data collection table as part ofthe application of this method.6.2.4 The algorithm collects data fro m 9 wafers out ofa lot of 10. Three setups are performed using 3 wafersper setup. All dice will be probed, but data will be takenonly on twelve of the die on each wafer. Twenty-fourpads on each die are evaluated (see Figure 4). Overall,2592 die pads are analyzed in a lot.6.2.5 When all the data is collected and analyzed, eachprobe system will have an average die offset value.This will be a comparative representation of accuracyconsisting of average offsets for all evaluated die. Thiscomparative representation of accuracy is a measure ofhow accurate the probe systems place the chuck, andthus the probe needles, to the center point on the diepads, consistent with normal operation of the probesystems.6.2.6 In general, when the probe ma rks are viewedacross all dice, there will be a data spread, ordistribution of error points for each wafer.Repeatability is the ± 3 variation of all die offsets,identified in this method as the 3 calculation ofNormalized Die Offset.6.3 Probe Card Issues  Probe car d constructionvariability and probe card usage at temperatures otherthan ambient are important considerations. Thefollowing sources of error should be kept in mind: In a hot chuck environment the probe card andneedles will experience a high percentage of theelevated chuck temperature. The material selectionfor the probe card will determine how it expandsand contracts due to the temperatures applied.Probe systems can be equipped with programmablepreheat (soak) times. Longer preheat times willreduce probe card variability while decreasingthroughput. Needle construction can result in excessive errordue to bending of the needles when excessiveprobe system z-stage overdrive is applied. Thenumber of needles and the selection of needletechnology, i.e., cantilever versus vertical, isanother variable, having a noticeable influence onmeasurement results. Since each user of this method is not confined to astandard for probe card construction, the user ofthis method is advised to choose a probe card andvendor with good integrity, and to use that sameprobe card when evaluating multiple probesystems. The assertion here is that the same probecard used to evaluate multiple systems will react ina repeatable manner under varying environmentalconditions. This assumes there is no excessive probe card needle wear during the multipleevaluations, and that needle alignment is verifiedor achieved before each execution of theprocedure.6.3.1 Probe mark scrub length can v ary due to severalfactors including: variations in the flatness of the chuck andstage travel that are not compensated by the z-sensor mapping algorithms by hard spots in the aluminum pads, or by variations in probe tip geometry, etc.6.3.2 To minimize the impact of this variation in theprobe mark analysis algorithm, use only scrub marklocation data that is taken normal to the direction ofscrub. Distances measured normal to the orientation ofthe scrub mark are generally accepted to besignificantly more stable than that which is takenparallel to the scrub mark (see Figure 2).6.3.3 In summary, the probe card its elf can be alimiting factor when making needle placement accuracymeasurements, especially at varying environmentalconditions. Material selection, vendor to vendorvariation, construction of a probe card (blade, epoxyring, vertical, etc.), especially with varyingenvironmental conditions, will create inconsistentanalysis results, unless care is taken with theapplication of this method. The precautions discussedhere are meant to promote consistent and accurateevaluation results for this method.6.3.4 Nevertheless, the precautions mentioned herecould ALSO be an important basis for using thismethod. As an example, a probe card is typicallydesigned for XY positional placement and planarity,and is expected to meet customer specificationrequirements in normal operation at room temperatures.This method could serve as a means of establishingnumerical results that represents the effects thattemperature or probe card construction variability haveon probe card specification requirements.6.4 The PMA Algorithm  A best-f it rectangle can bedrawn around the scrub mark and the passivationopening for each pad, reference Figure 3.NOTE: Applying a best-fit rectangle around the passivationopening may prove difficult for certain vision systems.Application of the best-fit rectangle around the die pad metalis an acceptable alternative. The center position of the best-fitrectangle around the scrub mark will represent the center ofthe scrub mark. The center of the die pad is the center of thebestfit rectangle around the passivation opening. Thedistance between the two centers is the pad offset. Pad offsetis computed from the four values left, right, top, and bottom,reference Figure 2.

The stability of the measurement isgreater when made perpendicular to the direction of thescrub mark. This will establish X and Y offsets viameasurement of offsets for pads in the X and Y plane ofthe die.6.4.2 Once the offsets are establishe d, a two-stepprocedure will manipulate 1296 X and 1296 Y offsetvalues. The end result of the algorithm will be arelative measure of the total probe system accuracy andrepeatability for the pads analyzed. Figure 5 representsa visual summary of the method.6.5 Considerations of Scale  When evaluating thesuitability of a particular probe system to probe aparticular size of bond pad, or to probe accurately at aparticular pad-to-pad pitch, a good rule of thumb is thatthe probers positional accuracy, as stated in itsspecifications, should be 1/10 that of the scale of thefeatures to be probed. For example, if the probe systembeing evaluated has an overall placement accuracy of5m, it would be inappropriate to analyze wafers usingthis method and this probe system for dice that havepads less than 50 m square (this would be less than10x).6.5.1 Regardless, when this method is used forevaluation of multiple systems, it is essential that dieand bond pad size/pitch consistency be maintained fromevaluation to evaluation if the results are to bemeaningful.6.5.2 The same 10 rule applies to t he vision systemor automated Probe Mark Analysis system employed tomake the pad offset measurements. These systemsshould have a pixel resolution that is at least 10 finerthan the die pad dimensions associated with the scrubmarks being measured.6.6 Conclusion  It is assumed th at the user of thismethod has a wafer probe system or systems, or isplanning to make a selection from the various systemsavailable in the market place, and requires objectivecomparative analysis for accuracy, repeatability andthroughput.6.6.1 It should be clear that this met hod employs athree-step process of probing, probe mark datacollection, and data analysis.6.6.2 When probing, every die on ea ch of the tenwafers is to be tested and probed. Of those tenwafers, the last nine with 12 die per wafer will be usedfor scrub mark data collection. At least 24 pads per diewill be used for the analysis. The first wafer is meantonly to allow stabilization for the probe system and itsprobe card.

SEMI G78-0699 © SEMI 1999 6 Figure 4Recommended Dice and Pads to be used for Data Collection 6.6.3 It is important that the wafers u sed with thismethod are probed only once, or else multiple scrubmarks may be difficult for the measurement system todeal with and will most likely influence the analysisresults. This method assumes the wafer is ideal, havingno die skew due to wafer process anomalies.NOTE: It is possible that a not so perfect probe tip to padalignment (PTTPA) may create misleading results for thismethod. It is recommended that PTTPA be done on dielocated at the edge of the wafer, as shown in Figure 4. This isopposed to having PTTPA done on die in the center of thewafer. An offset error incurred in the context of a PTTPA done in the center may result in an incremental and continuingerror as testing moves across the wafer. With this method thaterror may be averaged-out. 6.6.4 Probe system index time is dev ice and probesystem dependent. Probe system index time isdetermined by acceleration, maximum achievablevelocity, and distance traveled die to die by the chuck.Thus, the device type chosen for use with this methodshould be representative of typical die size ifmeaningful index time and throughput data are to begathered.

SEMI G78-0699 © SEMI 19997 6.6.5 If the results of this method tu rn out to beunfavorable, the user has the option of applying a moredetailed, enhanced data analysis application of thismethod. That application is contained in Appendix 1.The enhanced method uses the same data, but itrequires more manipulation of the data during dataanalysis. The detail contained in the enhancedalgorithm will provide the user with greater insight asto the cause of unfavorable results related to the probesystem under evaluation. A summary of the enhancedmethod is shown in Figure 6.6.7 Alternatives  What has been left undefined tothis point is availability of an automated approach todata collection per the requirements of this method.Regardless, data collection can be manuallyaccomplished. The manual process is laborious andrequires a video measuring system to make offset measurements on the die pads, and a spreadsheet toanalyze the resulting data.6.7.1 If manual operation is not desi rable or practical,automated Probe Mark Analysis Systems do exist in themarket place as an item to be purchased. Providers arealso available to accept probed wafers and executeprobe mark analysis under contract as a service.NOTE: A Final Note to the User of This Method  Thismethod provides sufficient data for sophisticated analysis ofprobe system performance across die-to-die, wafer-to-wafer,and setup-to-setup. It also provides a simple metric. It is easyto make comparisons with simple "single number" metrics,but that has the potential for oversight, distortion andsubsequent inappropriate comparisons. The test engineer,working with the probe system supplier, must be the ultimatejudge of the applicability of this method and the correctinterpretation of the results.

All adjustmentsto the prober are to be made using standard, end-user-adjustable settings, and all prober settings associatedwith a particular throughput / accuracy and repeatabilitycombination are to be included in the final report.9.3 Temperature  This test can b e conducted at anytemperature, however, numerous variable can distortthe results if run at a temperature other than ambient,i.e. probe tip drift due to an increase or decrease intemperature. Cautionary Note: If the tests are performed attemperatures other than ambient, the user must usethe same probe card and wafer type for all testsacross all test platforms to ensure uniformity ofresults.9.4 Probe Card Type  All types of probe cards(blade, peripheral / cantilever or vertical) may be used,so long as they leave a visible scrub mark. Cautionary note: Some vertical probe cards exhibitan inherent amount of x - y needle drift. Theuser should verify the intrinsic repeatability of theprobe card before using it to characterize theprober. Proberavailable?Probe cardavailable?"TestProgram"available?Stop-watchavailable?

Theforce exerted on the probe card by the PTI will stabilizethe probe card, improving the repeatability of the datacollected.9.8 Wafer Cassette  For the purp oses of these tests,a cassette of wafers is defined as containing ten wafers.Ensure the wafers are placed in the same slots for eachtest. 10 Test Procedure (see Figur es 8 and 9)10.1 Load wafer cassette10.2 Install probe card10.3 Set probe mode to serpentine, set all othernecessary prober parameters.

The center position of the best-fit rectangle can be used to represent the centerof the scrub mark. An offset of this center of scrub mark from the center of the bond pad can be calculated asfollows: 2/)(2/)(TopBottomPadYoffsetRightLeftPadXoffset== (1) A1-1.1.2 The variation of this offset fro m pad to pad, die to die, wafer to wafer and setup to setup captures most ofthe process variations. A1-1.2 PMA Data AnalysisA1-1.2.1 We will use a sampling schem e of 9 wafers per lot, (3 setups per lot, 3 wafers per setup), 12 die per waferand 24 pads per die. The first step of doing data analysis is to obtain the offsets for all the pads that have beensampled using Eqn.(1).

This value is probably the most descriptive, especially when graphed (see examplegraphs). Both X and Y-graphs will most likely resemble a sine wave. This is due to wafer rotation. As youserpentine across the wafer there will be a slight offset from die to die. Since the selected sample dice are in thecenter and around the edges of the wafer, you can see the progression of the offset as you move farther from thecenter of the wafer. The X and Y graphs are usually about 90 out of phase.A1-1.3.1.2 Other qualitative information c an also be gathered by visually looking at the graphs of this data. Onecan determine whether the accuracy is varying wafer to wafer (each set of 12 data points is a wafer) or set-up to set-up (each set of 36 data points is a set-up) or just drifting over time. Drift over time is sometimes caused bytemperature stabilization issues within the prober mechanism. Subsequent steps will quantify how much variabilityis caused by each.

The probe cardusually does NOT impact average offset of a die, just the variability within a die. In this equation, we subtract theaverage die offset (presumed prober error) from each pad in that die. This data is then used for the next step. A1-1.5 Step 3  Calculate P-P-X or P -P-Y = 3 of Normalized (by die) Pad Offset (4).A1-1.5.1 All the normalized pad offsets in the same lot (no matter on which die, on which wafer the pad resides)are treated on an equal basis. In our example, a total of 2592 pads are sampled in a lot. All 1296 x-direction and1296 y-direction pads of Normalized (by die) Pad Offset will be used to calculate a 3 variation which is calledPad-to-Pad variation (P-P-X and P-P-Y).A1-1.5.2 Discussion of P-P-X or P-P-Y (Pad-to-Pad Variation in the X-direction or Pad-to-Pad-Variation in the Y-direction)A1-1.5.2.1 These values describe how mu ch variability there is within all the pads in the lot. This value isfrequently attributed to probe tip variation in X, Y, and Z. Although probe tips do change and wear over time, theirunloaded position usually does not change dramatically within one lot. This value does not help tremendously indescribing prober accuracy nor should it be used for any sort of probecard metrology. However, be sure to performa mental reality check to verify that it is somewhere near (within an order of magnitude of) your probe card X/Yprobe needle position specification.

These numbers could also be graphed to look for trends from wafer to wafer (this is not included on the examplegraphs). If there is a consistent trend in one direction possible causes are:  wafer loading error cumulative stepping error, and temperature stability errors

To calculate the true Die-to-Die variation, any wafer-to-wafer induced error is subtracted out from the by-die-data. This data is used in the nextstep.

If this number were large, it would tend to indicate that the prober does not behave repeatably fromwafer-to-wafer. Possible causes are: loading problems temperature stability issues, and wafer rotation issues A1-1.12 Step 10  Calculate Average Lot Offset (9) = average of Average Setup Offset (7).

This is simply the average of all of the average dieoffsets in the X-direction and all of the average die offsets in the Y-direction.

This describes the repeatability of the prober.NOTE: There will always be explainable and unexplainable accuracy and repeatability errors on a prober. If these two lines fallwithin your desired specification, you will probably not have any problems. The example graph for X-offset illustrates a well-behaved, or passing prober. The example graph for Y-offset, on the other hand, is representative of a prober which failed tomeet the desired accuracy specification. A1-1.18.5 The upper and lower desired s pecification limits have been added to the graphs.A1-1.18.6 The final piece of data added t o the graph is the Average Die Offset.

SEMI G79-0200 © SEMI 2000 2 NOTE 1: The term input as it appears in this documentrefers to the device under test. 6 Test Methods6.1 See Figure 1.NOTE 2: A verification procedure to complement this OverallDigital Timing Accuracy Specification is currently beingdeveloped as a SEMI draft document.6.2 Explanation of Figure 1  Th is figure is meant tographically describe Overall Timing Accuracy and itsconstituent components. Overall Timing Accuracy(OTA) is made up of three components, and bydefinition is the aggregate timing error comprised ofinput edge placement accuracy (see Section 7.1.1),output edge placement accuracy (see Section 7.1.2), andinput to output timing accuracy (see Section 7.1.3). Itsimportant to note that the OTA specification andassociated graphical representation shown in Figure 1 ismeant to encompass timing delay errors across multiplemachines, as well as multiple calibrations for a singlemachine over time.6.2.1 Our experience in dealing with multiple-pinautomated test systems reveals that not all input drivecircuits can place a drive edge at exactly the same pointin time relative to a common reference. The same istrue for output compare circuits when placing compareedges. Thus, these edges tend to have an (error)distribution around some average value relative to theirintended placement. This is due in part to the inherent anomalies associated with electronic circuits that make-up these edge placement elements. The distribution ofedge error is graphically shown for input (see Section7.1.1) and output edge (see Section 7.1.2) signals inFigure 1.6.2.2 Drive Input to Compare Outpu t TimingAccuracy (Section 7.1.3) can be described in differentways. It is easy to think of this parameter, per thedefinition given in this document, Section 7.1.3, assimply the relative time difference (skew) between thedrive delay timing error distribution and the comparedelay timing error distribution for a particular machine.But this parameter, once established for a machine, isnot necessarily constant. For example, this parametercan change from one calibration of a machine at aparticular time, to something different, as a result of asubsequent calibration of that same machine. As well,this parameter can also be considered as a machine tomachine accuracy parameter, not necessarily having thesame value between any two machines of the samekind.6.2.3 Thus, on each machine and at different points intime for the same machine the Drive Input to CompareOutput Timing skew can be uniquely different permachine. That difference being influenced by thevarious machine anomalies that contribute to machineerror including the not so perfect results of a periodicedge calibration. 7.1.2 Input to Output TimingAccuracy (7.1.3) Output Edge PlacementAccuracy (7.1.2) 7.1.3 Input Edge PlacementAccuracy (7.1.1) 7.1.1 Output delay timing error- For another machine,or a new spread for the same machine as a resultof a calibration. 7.1.2Output timing delayerror.

SEMI G80-0200 © SEMI 20001 SEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT This test method was technically approved by the Global Automated Test Equipment Committee and is thedirect responsibility of the North American Automated Test Equipment Committee. Current edition approvedby the North American Regional Standards Committee on September 3, 1999. Initially available atwww.semi.org December 1999; to be published February 2000. 1 Purpose1.1 This procedure will define a st andard processwhereby any logic integrated circuit (IC) ATE systemcan be evaluated for parameters that makeup an ACtiming accuracy specification.1.2 Application of this procedure w ill simplify ATEcomparisons, reduce specification ambiguity, simplifyuser acceptance procedures, simplify ATE performancemonitoring, and provide a common validation criteriafor ATE suppliers. 2 Scope2.1 This procedure is intended for analysis of timingaccuracy specifications for all semiconductor automatictest equipment (ATE) capable of digital functionaltesting. The extent of the analysis includes overalltiming accuracy and the primary components of overalltiming accuracy as defined in the definition section ofthis document.2.2 This procedure does not includ e analysis of thefollowing parameters associated with ATE timingaccuracy: minimum driver pulse width, comparator bandwidth, I/O round trip delay, test fixturing errors, device insertion errors, time measurement unit (TMU) accuracy, and ATE capability or performance beyond AC timingaccuracy.2.3 Application of this procedure c an reduceequipment acceptance time resulting in savings for boththe end-users and ATE suppliers.2.4 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 The following limitations are i nherent to thisprocedure:3.1.1 The tolerances of each measur ement used in theprocedure are listed in each test, where appropriate.3.1.2 The verification methods do n ot include varyingenvironmental conditions, so results may not reflectperformance at environmental limits.3.1.2.1 Due to execution time limits, t he verificationprocedure does not represent an exhaustive analysis.The number of data points analyzed is intended to pro-vide a minimum representative assessment of AC tim-ing accuracy parameters in a practical amount of time.3.1.3 This method uses only edge co mpare mode andnon-multiplexed operation in providing a minimumrepresentative assessment of AC timing accuracy.3.1.4 This method does not determin e the effects thatduty cycle variations have on AC timing accuracy.3.1.5 Not being an exhaustive analy sis this methodavoids comprehensive testing as might be expected forcomplex AC timing functions such as on-the-fly (OTF)timing. This method was defined with the intention ofkeeping the data gathering practical such thatmeaningful results are obtained in a reasonable amountof time. In the case of timing-on-the fly a routine iscontained in this method and can be used as a referenceparameter for comparative purposes when systems withon-the-fly timing are analyzed. Thus only the mostfundamental AC timing results are produced and OTFtiming is not included as part of the overall timingaccuracy (OTA) results.3.1.6 Discretion is advised when int erpreting OTAresults obtained from this method. Self-analysis cannotallow for all error components to be isolated. Thus good(compliant) method results should be viewed with cau-tion as potentially compliant. On the other hand, poor(non-compliant) method results are a strong indicationthat the system under evaluation is questionableregarding its accuracy and most likely non-compliant.

Thehierarchy supports two levels of specification analysis.Broad, composite net results are available by using theATE for self-analysis in Level 1.6.2 At this level, a large amount o f data can be effi-ciently collected, representing the net conformance tooverall timing accuracy specifications. This technique,however, precludes isolation and detailed analysis ofspecific accuracy components. Therefore, a secondlevel of analysis, incorporating external instruments isincluded. While the first level provides efficient, broadanalysis, the second level provides less efficient,detailed analysis.6.3 Results from the analyses are s aved in a standardformat to facilitate further use for application specificdata reduction.

It is importantthat this equipment requirement step be met. Tolerancescalled-out in various steps of this procedure werechosen to be consistent with the general equipmentspecified in this equipment specification requirement.7.4 This Procedure  It is highly recommended thatthe user of this method read this document (SEMI G80)in its entirety.7.5 System  Test system usage will be available ona continuous basis and uninterrupted during the allottedtime needed to perform this timing analysis procedure.7.6 Application Program  It is r equired that anapplication program be written to perform the stepscalled-out in this procedure. That program will act as ameans of reliable and consistent interaction between thetester and supplemental equipment. In so executing,that program will also facilitate the data collectionprocess that will ultimately lead to the timing analysisconclusions this procedure produces. 7.7 The Method  The recommen ded procedure, con-tained primarily in Section 10 of this document, is gen-erically written and will serve as a guide in producingthe required program, written in the test applicationsoftware language of the system under evaluation.7.8 ATE System Performance (Loa d) Boards  Tocollect data two performance/load boards will berequired. For one of these performance boards it isrecommended that adjacent tester channels be shortedtogether with minimum and equal length intercon-nections. This board will facilitate the data collectionprocess for Level 1 and in part for Level 2. The secondboard is to have an open driver to comparatorconnection and will be used for Level 2 drive inputtiming tests. Reference Figures 1 and 4.7.9 Exceptions  It is expected th at the user of thismethod execute the procedures as described in thisdocument. If the method user should choose to deviatefrom the procedures recommended in this document itis expected that an appropriate description of thatdeviation be entered in the EXCEPTIONS PAGEprovided in Appendix 3. 8 Test Conditions8.1 Environmental  It is a requir ement that theprocedure called-out in this document be executedwithin the intended environmental operating conditionsspecified by the equipment supplier. Operatingtemperature requirements specified by the equipmentsupplier must be maintained.8.2 Optional Execution  The use r of this proceduremay consider rerunning this procedure at environmental(temperature) extremes other than nominal.8.3 Warm-up Period  It is essen tial that allequipment used or under evaluation be allowed towarm-up in accordance with the manufacturersspecified requirements for equipment stabilization.8.4 Optional Data Collection  D ata may be takenimmediately after equipment calibration. However, theuser of this procedure may wish to take additional dataat subsequent time intervals, but within the known goodcalibration window for the system under evaluation. 9 Preparation of Apparatus9.1 Equipment Configuration  T he equipment underevaluation must be configured for its normal andintended operation. No special considerations such asadditional cooling or removal of equipment skins are tobe undertaken.9.2 Equipment Calibration  The equipment underevaluation must be fully calibrated before this proce-dure is executed.

Any ATE capability described in thefollowing tests that is not available on the ATE underanalysis is not required for compliance to theprocedure, but should be noted in the verificationresults Table 1 and Table 2.10.2 Each test system is different; t hus this procedureis generic. Regardless, it will provide comprehensiveresults when the specific application is created usingthis procedure as a guide. Per the requirements, a loadboard and application program written to accommodatethe procedure should be in place when the procedure isexecuted. This procedure is to be executed per therequirements outlined in Section 7 of this document.When these requirements are met, the following stepswill comprise the step by step process for execution ofthis Test Method: Adjacent pins shorted together Pin n Pin n+1 ShortPin nDriver Receiver Pin n+1Driver Receiver Tester Performanceboard Pairs of adjacent tester pins are shorted together with aminimum length interconnect on the performance board. Figure 1Level 1 Verification 1. Install the performance board. 2. Power up the system and supplemental equipment,allow adequate time for stabilization.3. Load the appropriate application program thatrepresents the embodiment of the procedure called outin Sections 10.3.1, 10.3.4, 10.3.5, and 10.3.6 for Level1 as well as Sections 10.4.1, 10.4.2, 10.4.3, 10.4.4,10.4.5, and 10.4.6 for Level 2.4. Execute the method to completion. The applicationprogram can capture the data for Level 1 and Level 2and store that for later analysis.5. This procedure calls for various time measurementsto be made at specified voltage points or signal levels.The user is encouraged to maintain these values to keepthe method results constants when system to systemcomparisons are being made. Regardless, he is free toadjust these measurement points or levels to accommo-date specific integrated circuit technology requirementsimportant to that product and the system beinganalyzed. When that occurs documentation of thoseprocedure variations must be entered in Appendix 3(Exceptions Page).6. Best results from this procedure are achieved if aconsistent measurement methodology is maintained.This is important when making time measurementsrelative to a particular transition point on a signal edge.This method recommends that when signal measure-ments are specified at a particular transition point, i.e.,50%, that this point on the edge be determined relativeto the 0% or 100% steady state levels displayed on theoscilloscope, after any aberrations due to the transitionhave expired. A tester reference channel, the lowestchannel, should be used to set the measurement point(s)and then consistently used as the basis for subsequentmeasurements for the remaining tester channels.7. Data Analysis  Analyze the captured data andmake the appropriate data entries to Table 1, providedin this method document.8. When this method execution is complete, documentall method exceptions in the EXCEPTIONS section ofthis document (Appendix 3).9. Results  Data entry to Table 2. Make theappropriate data entries to Table 2, provided in thismethod document and supplemented with examplescontained in Appendix 2. 10.2.1 Level 1 requires no external eq uipment forcompletion, whereas Level 2 does require use ofexternal equipment. The user is free to implement thisprocedure through total manual intervention. On theother hand, the user may choose to apply an automatedor robotic approach to data collection for Level 2.Regardless, the user is advised that tester and external

Thisis accomplished by shorting adjacent tester channelstogether on a performance board with minimum, equallength interconnections, and using one channel to testthe other. Reference Figure 1. Execution speed andsystem resource coverage are of primary importance forLevel 1. Level 1 is intended to analyze specificationconformance as opposed to diagnose system failures.All measurements are normalized to zero in order tofacilitate subsequent data reduction/analysis. Level 1 isintended to collect data only. Data reduction andprocessing are to be done off-line in order to maximizedata collection efficiency.10.3.1 Timing Linearity Test  This test is used toestablish drive input to compare output timing accuracyby stretching the test cycle in minimum cycleprogramming increments while using fixed percentagedelays and pulse widths as the method sweeps throughvarious timing conditions. The test pattern should bewritten to switch all even or odd pins simultaneously,and for all transitions and associated strobes to occur atleast 100 times for each data point.10.3.2 For clarification all drive edge s are detected inparallel in pairs. The intention is to sweep the compareedge and detect the earliest occurrence of a drive edgewith the latest compare edge, as well as detect the latestoccurrence of a drive edge with the earliest compareedge.

Note: Load C: 50 ohms to low for driver z to high and high to ztransitions. And 50 ohms to high for driver z to low and low to z transitions.8 This algorithm requires 64 time sets. If the equipment does not have 64 timesets, adjust the algorithm to accommodate the amount available and note thedifferences on the exception page, Appendix 3.

On the other hand the shortedperformance board, using the driver as the signalsource, is a viable approach for the Compare OutputTiming Error Test. Regardless, the user mayoptionally choose to use a pulse generator as thesignal source for the Compare Output Timing Errortest. The 50-ohm pulse generator must have edgespeeds that are comparable to the driver it isreplacing.

The use of externalinstruments facilitates independent observation ofindividual parameters, but requires physical movementof a probe (unless automated with robotics), whichresults in less efficient data collection. ReferenceFigure 4.10.4.1 Drive Input Timing Error Test  Since thedriver input timing error cannot be distinguished fromcompare output timing error with Level 1 tests 9 anexternal instrument must be used to isolate the driverinput timing error from compare output timing error.An external instrument is also required to identify pinto pin skew beyond adjacent pins, since Level 1 onlyuses adjacent pin pairs for analysis. This requiresindependent measurements of representative driverinput timing conditions. The reference formeasurement of driver input timing error is a highbandwidth-digital sampling oscilloscope. Exhaustivetesting of all pins is impractical, so a reduced set ofrepresentative conditions is used. A non-binary pinsampling increment is used to ensure that traditionalbinary architectural boundaries are crossed. Thetolerance for the driver input timing error test is ±20ps10 due to the tester/instrument interaction using ageneric measurement method.

Each tester driver is usedto provide a synchronous reference signal by shortingadjacent tester channels together on a performanceboard with minimum, equal length interconnections.The actual delay of the driver signal is verified with ahigh bandwidth-digital sampling oscilloscope. (SeeFigure 4.)NOTE 2: If a signal reflection is present at the midpoint of theobserved signal (due to a long distance from the performanceboard to the tester receiver), then the 25% point of thereference driver waveform should be used, instead of themidpoint - as specified below. 10.4.2.1 Exhaustive testing of all pins i s impractical,so a reduced set of representative conditions are used.A non-binary pin sampling increment is used to ensurethat traditional binary architectural boundaries arecrossed.10.4.2.2 The following nested loop out line describesthe test flow:for amplitude = 3Vfor pin = 1 to n by 3for test\_cycle = min, 2\*min, 3\*min, 10\*minfor format\_delay = 50% of test\_cyclefor format = NRfor edge = rising, fallingdetect midpoint of NR drive signal withoscilloscope (averaging = 8)detect midpoint of drive transition withcomparator (strobe compare mode)error = (measured\_delay - pro-grammed\_compare\_delay -zero\_reference\_measurement)end edgeend formatend format\_delayend test\_cycleend pinend amplitudeNOTE 3: Midpoint detection of the NR drive signal should bedone via a compare edge sweep technique. 10.4.3 Driver Transition Time Test  Since drivertransition time errors can be masked by compare timingerrors and comparator bandwidth limitations, anexternal instrument is required to measure drivertransition time errors.
