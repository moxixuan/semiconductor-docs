5. 2  discoloration — The change in  color of any plated
metallization,  gold,  silver,  aluminum,  etc.,  as  detected
by  the  unaided  eye  after  the  application  of  heat  to  the
metallization.   The   metallization   may   be   over   base
metal, another plated layer, or on refractory metal.
5. 3   peeling  (flaking)  —  Any  separ ation  of  the  plated,
vacuum deposited or clad metal from the base metal of
a  leadframe,  lead,  pin,  heatsink,  or  seal  ring,  from  an
underplate,   or   from   refractory   metal   on   a   ceramic
package. Peeling exposes the underlying material. Also
called flaking.</p><p>SEMI G8-94 © SEMI 1983, 19962
5. 4    pitting   (plated   metal   layer)   —    Unspecified
depressions  in  the  plated  layer,  not  the  underlying
layer(s).  Such  pits  may  be  caused  by  incorrect  plating
conditions.
5. 5  resin bleed-out (die attach) — T he surface creep of
a resin used for die attach beyond the outer perimeter of
the   bulk   of   the   resin   (filler).   For   a   given   resin
formulation, the resin creep may be exacerbated by the
microstructure and cleanliness of the die attach surface.
5. 6    scratch   —   An   abrasion   in   the    surface   of   a
metallization layer which exposes the base material.
6  Interferences
6. 1  Avoid contaminating the gold  plated surface (e.g.,
with  finger  oils),  prior  to  performing  the  tests.  Such
contamination  may  effect  visual  appearance,  and  die
attach, wire bond, and solderability functional tests.

(see Figure 18).
19. 2   Clamp  8  oz.  weight  on  bottom -half  of  lead  (see
Figure  19).  Clamp  must  be  at  least  L/2  from  lead
shoulder.
NOTE: If lead is clamped too close to shoulder, a reduction in
measured  lead  strength  will  result,  caused  by  twisting  of
weight.

RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR RAM FOLLOWER GEL TIME AND
SPIRAL FLOW OF THERMAL SETTING MOLDING COMPOUNDS
1  Scope
This  method  describes  a  procedure  for  measuring  the
flow  and  gel  characteristics  of  semiconductor  grade
transfer   molding   compounds   using   a   ram   follower
device.
2  Applicable Documents
1
ASTM D 3123 — Plastics, Molding, and Extrusions
3  Significance
3. 1   The  flow  of  a  molding  compou nd  depends  on  the
interaction of several variables, and is a measure of the
combined  characteristics  of  speed  of  gelation  and  melt
viscosity    of    the    particular    compound    under    the
specified  conditions.  The  test  is  not  a  valid  method  for
comparing   the   moldability   of   different   compounds
since a spiral flow test cannot duplicate actual molding
conditions in different types of molds.
3. 2     The    moldability    of    thermosetti ng    molding
compounds  has  generally  been  defined  by  a  single
spiral  flow  number.  The  ram  follower  device  follows
graphically  the  molding  compound  as  it  melts  and  the
rate  of  flow  increases,  as  viscosity  builds  up  due  to
resin  polymerization,  and  as  the  flow  of  the  compound
ceases.  Thus,  it  measures  the  gelation  point  of  the
compound,  or  the  point  where  the  material  ceases  to
flow.  This  information  can  be  an  aid  in  characterizing
the rheological behavior of the molding compound.
4  Apparatus
4. 1   Transfer  Molding  Press  —  Wi th  a  platen  area
sufficient  to  maintain  a  uniform  mold  temperature  and
having  (1)  a  transfer  piston  pressure  potential  of  1000
psi  on  the  material;  (2)  sufficient  clamping  pressure  to
prevent  flashing  of  the  molding  compound;  and  (3)  a
minimum  plunger  speed  of  25.4  mm  (1  inch)  per
second without load. The pot diameter shall be 31.75 to
44. 45 ± 0.635 mm (1.250 to 1.750 ± 0.025 inch) and the
clearance  between  pot  and  ram  shall  be  sufficiently
small   that   flashing   does   not   occur   above   the   first
sealing groove on the ram.
4. 2  Standard Spiral Flow Mold —  Per ASTM D 3123.
4. 3   Ram  Following  Apparatus  —   Consisting  of  a
displacement transducer attached to the transfer ram of</p><p>1 American Society for Testing and Materials, 100 Barr Harbor
Drive, West Conshohoken, PA 19428-2959
the  press  in  such  a  way  as  to  accurately  record  its
movement,  suitable  power  supply  for  the  displacement
transducer,  and  a  recorder  capable  of  recording  the
signal from the displacement transducer and preferably
having a chart speed of at least 10 mm per second. An
optional  velocity  transducer  can  also  be  used  as  a
means of directly measuring ram velocity and verifying
the starting and ending of the flow process. In this case,
a 2-channel recorder is needed.
4. 4  Thermocouple and Potentiome ter  —  Calibrated  in
the  149°  to  177°C  (300°  to  350°F)  range.  (Calibration
to be checked every six months.)
5  Test Conditions
5. 1  Molding Compound — Refrig erated shipment and
storage  of  some  molding  compounds  is  necessary.  The
molding compound is to be at room temperature before
the   container   is   opened.   Once   the   compound   has
equilibrated to room temperature, the test should be run
within  16  hours.  Care  must  be  taken  to  preserve  the
original  moisture  content.  The  material  should  be  in
powdered form, unless otherwise specified.
NOTE: Room temperature defined to be 23° ± 5°C.
NOTE:  Refer  to  manufacturers&#x27;  recommendations  regarding
shelf   life   differences   which   may   exist   between   molding
compounds.
5. 2   The  Spiral  Flow  Mold  —  Shal l  be  clean  and  free
from any mold release agents or lubricants. A standard
mold  cleaning  compound  can  be  used  to  insure  mold
cleanliness.
5. 3  Molding Conditions
5. 3.1   The  temperature  of  the  mold  s hall  be  measured
using  a  thermocouple  inserted  in  the  mold.  The  ram
shall   be   kept   at   the   mold   temperature.   Molding
temperature  is  to  be  as  recommended  by  the  material
specification  unless  otherwise  specified.  Temperature
must   be   maintained   within   ±   3°C   (±   5°F)   of   the
specified temperature.
NOTE:  Flow  duration  is  strongly  influenced  by  temperature.
For   critical   determinations,   the   temperature   should   be
maintained  as  close  to  the  nominal  temperature  as  practical,
preferably within ± 0.5°C (± 1°F).
5. 3.2   The  weight  of  the  charge  shall   be  adjusted  to
give  a  molded  cull  thickness  of  3.302  ±  0.254  mm
(0.130 ± 0.010 in.), excluding vertical flash.</p><p>SEMI G11-88 © SEMI 1981, 19962
5. 3.3  The free running ram speed sh all be at least 25.4
mm/sec  (1&quot;/sec).  Recommended  speed  is  100  ±  25
mm/sec  into  the  pot  and  application  of  pressure  on  the
charge shall not exceed 5 seconds.
5. 3.4    The   transfer   pressure   measured    under   the
transfer plunger is to be 6.895 ± 0.177 mpa (1000 ± 25
psi) unless otherwise specified.
5. 3.5   Unless  otherwise  specified,  a  m inimum  of  1.5
minutes close and cure time shall be used.
5. 4    Flow   Length   —   Read   the   spira l   flow   length
directly  from  the  molded  specimen  at  the  point  of
farthest  continuous  flow  to  the  nearest  6.35  mm  (0.25
in).
5. 5  Flow Duration — The flow du ration or gel time is
defined as the time interval between the moment when
the ram contacts the charge and the time the ram stops
moving. The contact and gelation points are determined
from the ram follower trace.
6  Procedure for Spiral Flow
6. 1   Thoroughly  clean  the  ram,  pot ,  and  mold  of  any
cured compound, or other foreign matter.
6. 2   Heat  the  mold  and  ram  to  with in  (±  3°C)  of  the
specified temperature.
6. 3  At the beginning of each series  of tests and at each
change   of   compound,   check   and   set   the   transfer
pressure  using  the  force  gage.  The  proper  force  gage
setting can be determined from the formula:
F=
πD
2
P
4
where F is the force in pounds, P is the desired pressure
on  the  material  in  psi  and  D  is  the  ram  diameter  in
inches.
6. 4   For  each  material  change,  mak e  at  least  three
“clean  out”  runs  using  the  material  to  be  tested  before
recording  data.  These  runs  may  be  used  to  determine
the charge weight.
6. 5   Weigh  out  the  compound  to  th e  nearest  0.1  g  as
previously  determined  to  yield  a  cull  of  3.302  ±  0.254
mm (0.130 ± 0.010 in.).
6. 6   Raise  the  ram,  add  the  compou nd  to  the  pot,  and
immediately  activate  the  transfer  cycle.  If  the  recorder
does  not  have  a  remote  on-off  that  is  activated  by  the
cycle  start,  then  it  should  be  started  before  the  cycle
starts.  After  the  ram  motion  ceases,  the  chart  may  be
stopped.
6. 7   Open  mold  and  remove  cured   material.  Measure
cull  thickness.  If  the  cull  is  not  within  3.302  ±  0.254
mm (0.130 ± 0.010 in.), discard run and repeat the test,
adjusting the charge weight as necessary.
6. 8   Read  the  flow  length  to  the  ne arest  6.35  mm  (0.5
in.).
6. 9  Mark the point on the chart wh ere the ram contacts
the charge. This point is identified on the displacement
trace  as  the  point  at  which  the  rate  of  displacement
initially changes.
6. 10   Mark  where  the  ram  stopped  m oving.  Caution
should  be  exercised  where  significant  flashing  occurs.
Count  the  number  of  divisions  between  the  two  points
and  divide  by  the  chart  speed.  The  result  is  the  flow
duration or gel time in seconds. Record this time to the
nearest second.
6. 11   If  the  optional  velocity  trace  is   available,  mark
point  on  the  chart  where  the  ram  contacts  the  charge.
This point is identified on the velocity trace as the point
at which the transfer velocity transducer initially detects

6. 12  Mark where the ram stopped m oving. In order to
detect the point of zero (0) velocity, the signal must be
of sufficient magnitude. Count the number of divisions
between  the  two  points  and  divide  by  the  chart  speed.
The  result  is  the  flow  duration  or  gel  time  in  seconds.
Record this time to the nearest second.

tooling  required  to  mold  and  form  plastic  molded  DIP
semiconductor  packages.  It  is  to  be  used  by  packaging
engineers,  mold  manufacturers,  and  end-of-line  tool
makers   as   the   basis   for   defining   the   limits   of
manufacturing tolerances.

latest publications of adopted standards.
3  Selected Definitions — Pr oduct Criteria
Tolerance Limits
3. 1   mismatch  and  offset  —  Define d  with  respect  to
package only. All statements will be equally applicable
in two (2) axes. All mismatch and offset measurements
are made after molding and prior to trimming.
3. 1.1  cavity to frame offset  —  Will  b e  measured  prior
to any trimming operation. Offset will be defined as the
difference  in  bottom  cavity  position  with  respect  to  a
leadframe datum. The offset measurement will exclude
leadframe tolerances. (See Figure 1.)
3. 1.2   top  to  bottom  cavity  mismatch  —  Characterized
by the fact that the top and bottom cavities in the mold
are not aligned properly, causing a mismatch condition.
The measurement shall be stated as the difference in the
top   cavity   position   relative   to   the   bottom   cavity
position. (See Figure 2.)</p><p>1 JEDEC, 20001 Eye Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006

3. 2  parting line protrusions — Th ose plastic excesses
which  remain  as  a  normal  characteristic  after  normal
trimming and molding operations. (See Figure 4.)
3. 3    top   or   bottom   protrusions   —   T hose   plastic
excesses  (includes  ejector  pin  “crowns”)  which  remain
as  normal  characteristics  extending  from  the  smooth
surface of the molded package.
3. 4  variations in lead position — D efined with respect
to  a  90°  angle  from  the  top  or  bottom  of  the  smooth
surface of the molded package as viewed on the end or
side projections. (See Figure 4.)
3. 5    shoulder   width   intrusions/prot rusions   —   Any
variations  in  straightness  along  the  defined  shoulder
width caused by dambar removal. (See Figure 4.)
3. 6   package  warpage  —  Any  non -linear  dimensional
change  from  the  mold  cavity  characteristic,  usually
caused   by   incorrect   package   design   or   molding
practices. (See Figure 5.)
3. 7   shoulder  bend  location  —  Me asured  from  the
outermost point of the inner shoulder bend radius. (See
Figure 6.)

NOTE  1:  Gas  Purge  Considerations  —  A  reactive  gas  purge
affects  the  material  under  test.  A  gas  must  be  chosen  that
reflects   the   molding   conditions   normally   used   for   that
material (i.e., air or nitrogen).
5. 2   Sampling  Pans  for  DSC  Cell  —   (Aluminum  with
crimping or hermetically sealed.) The pans must not be
reactive to the sample under test.
5. 3    Process   Controller   —   Capable    of   collecting,
calculating,  and  plotting  the  data  resulting  from  the
calorimeter.
5. 4  Analytical Balance — Accurac y 0.001 mg.
5. 5  Tweezers and Microspatula
6  Sampling
6. 1   When  the  method  is  used  to  ev aluate  incoming
molding  materials,  the  sampling  plan  shall  be  agreed
between supplier and customer.
6. 2  Powdered or granular molding  compounds shall be
thoroughly  mixed  before  sampling.  If  the  compound  is
supplied  in  a  preform,  a  small  section  may  be  cut  off
the preform with a blade.
7  Preparation of Samples
7. 1   Protect  samples  from  moisture   absorption  while
awaiting test.
8  Equipment Setup and Cal ibration
8. 1   Temperature  Calibration  —  (R efer  to  ASTM  E

9  Procedure
9. 1   Sample  Size  —  2.000  to  12.00 0  mg  may  be  used.
8. 000   mg   is   commonly   used.   A   small   design   of
experiments   exercise   may   be   used   to   obtain   the
optimum sample size for the molding compound under
test.   Different   compound   chemistries   may   have   an
effect  on  the  results  if  the  sample  size  is  not  carefully
chosen.
Place the sample in the sample pan.
9. 2   Use  an  empty  sample  pan  with   its  cover  as  a
reference.
9. 3  Carefully place the sample and  reference pans onto
their  respective  thermal  sensors  in  the  DSC  cell.  Seal
the cell according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions.
9. 4   Set  the  heating  rate  to  the  optim u m  conditions
determined for that instrument and the specific material
under  test.  This  rate  will  normally  be  between  5°C  and
25°C per minute.
9. 5   Activate  the  test  sequence,  and   heat  the  sample
from room-temperature to 300°C in order to obtain the
DSC curve.
9. 6   At  the  end  of  the  run,  remove   the  sample,  and
allow  the  DSC  cell  to  cool  to  room-temperature  in
preparation for the next sample.

SPECIFICATION FOR DIMENSIONS AND TOLERANCES USED TO
MANUFACTURE PLASTIC CHIP CARRIER TOOLING
1  Preface
This document is a guideline for the ordering of tooling
required  to  mold  and  form  plastic  chip  carriers.  It  is  to
be  used  by  packaging  engineers,  mold  manufacturers
and end of line tool makers as the basis for defining the
limits of manufacturing tolerances.

3  Selected Definitions — Pr oduction Criteria
Tolerance Limits
3. 1   mismatch  and  offset  —  Define d  with  respect  to
package only. All statements will be equally applicable
in two (2) axes. All mismatch and offset measurements
are made after molding and prior to trimming.
3. 1.1  cavity to frame offset  —  Will  b e  measured  prior
to any trimming operation. Offset will be defined as the
difference  in  bottom  cavity  position  with  respect  to  a
leadframe datum. The offset measurement will exclude
leadframe tolerances. (See Figure 1.)
3. 1.2   top  to  bottom  cavity  mismatch  —  Characterized
by the fact that the top and bottom cavities in the mold
are not aligned properly, causing a mismatch condition.
The measurement shall be stated as the difference in the
top   cavity   position   relative   to   the   bottom   cavity
position. (See Figure 2.)
3. 2  Molded Protrusions
3. 2.1    parting   line   protrusions   —   Th ose   plastic
excesses  which  remain  as  a  normal  characteristic  after
normal molding, deflashing, trimming, and singulation.
(See Figure 6.)
3. 2.2   top  or  bottom  protrusions  —  T hose  plastic
excesses (includes ejector pin “crowns”), which remain</p><p>1 Military Standards, Naval Publications and Form Center, 5801

as  a  normal  characteristic  extending  from  the  smooth
surface of the molded package.
3. 3  variations in lead location —  Defined with respect
to  a  90°  angle  from  the  top  or  bottom  of  the  smooth
surface of the molded package as viewed on the end or
side projections. (See Figure 6.)
3. 4   lead  shoulder  protrusions  and   intrusions  —  Any
variations  in  straightness  along  the  defined  shoulder
width caused by dambar removal. (See Figure 6.)
3. 5   package  warpage  —  Any  non -linear  dimensional
change  from  the  mold  cavity  characteristic,  usually
caused   by   incorrect   package   design   or   molding
practices. (See Figure 3.)
3. 6   shoulder  bend  location  —  Me asured  from  the
outermost   point   of   the   shoulder   bend   radius.   (See
Figure 4.)
3. 7   lead  co-planarity  —  Defined  a s  the  vertical  lead

7. 4   Camber  (Edgewise  Curvature)   —  Camber  is  not
critical   for   material   used   in   the   etching   process
provided  the  end  product  (leadframe  strip)  meets  its
requirements;  ±  0.0625&quot;  (1.6  mm)  in  36&quot;  (91  cm)  is
considered acceptable.
7. 5   Coil  Set  —  A  three  foot  long  s ample  shall  be
obtained from each coil supplied. The measured coil set
shall not exceed 1.500&quot; (38.1 mm).

7. 8  Oil Can — When any part of a  sheet is pushed, but
not  bent,  and  it  snaps  into  a  different  position  or  plane
other than the original position with no further pressure,
oil  canning  is  present.  Oil  canning  shall  not  be  present
on  materials  being  used  in  the  photo  chemical  process
(etching)  to  the  extent  that  the  maximum  crossbow
specification  on  the  finished  product  (see  Table  2)
cannot be met.
8  Surface Finish
8. 1  The material shall be commerc ially free of surface
imperfections   such   as   pits,   nicks,   dents,   gouges,
scratches, laminations, or inclusions.
8. 2   Surface  defects  less  than  0.000 3&quot;  (0.0076  mm)  in
depth  will  be  acceptable  unless  otherwise  agreed  upon

See  applicable  leadframe  drawing  as  referred  to  in  the
ordering information.
6  Defect Limits and Parame ters (see SEMI
G10 to Measure)
6. 1   Minimum  Flat  Wire  Bonding  A rea  —  0.203  mm
(0.008&quot;)  or  80%  of  nominal  lead  width,  whichever  is
greater  in  width  and  0.635  mm  (0.025&quot;)  in  length.
Undercut  is  an  unavoidable  process  of  etching.  The
above parameters are applicable only so long as the flat
surface area is obtainable using the formula of Figure 4.
The “radiusing” effect of the etching process will round
off  the  tips  and,  therefore,  the  length  of  the  flat  area
should be measured by starting back from the tip 0.254
mm (0.010&quot;).
NOTE: 0.008&quot; flat is desirable. In order to achieve 0.008&quot; flat,
on  0.010&quot;  thick  material,  it  is  necessary  to  have  a  design
width  of  0.022&quot;  center  to  center,  giving  a  0.012&quot;  wide  lead
and 0.010&quot; wide space.
6. 2  Horizontal Lead Spacing and  Location

Application Note: There is a question regarding the ability of
material  suppliers  to  meet  this  specification.  Revision  of  this
specification is under review.
6. 10.2  Die Attach Pad — Functional  side inside 0.508
mm  (0.020&quot;)  border;  nothing  greater  than  0.127  mm
(0.005&quot;)  diameter  ×  50%  metal  thickness  in  depth;  not
more than 2 pits.
6. 10.3  Die Attach Pad  —  Nonfunctio nal  side;  nothing
greater   than   .508   mm   (0.020&quot;)   ×   50%   of   metal
thickness  in  depth;  not  more  than  3  pits;  cannot  affect
leadframe strength regardless of size (i.e., pit cannot be
located  within  0.127  mm  (0.50&quot;)  of  pad  support  bar
attachments).
6. 10.4   Internal  leadframe  areas  where   design  width  is
0. 635  mm  (0.025&quot;)  or  more,  must  be  less  than  0.381
mm (0.015&quot;) × 50% metal thickness in depth; if design
width is less than 0.635 mm (0.025&quot;), area must be 50%
of   design   width.   Cannot   affect   leadframe   strength
regardless of size.
6. 10.5    Major   Lead   Areas   (outside   da mbar) —
Nothing  greater  than  0.127  mm  (0.005&quot;)  ×  50%  of
metal  thickness  in  depth;  nothing  greater  than  0.254
mm  (0.010&quot;)  on  shoulder  above  taper.    Cannot  affect
leadframe strength regardless of size.
6. 10.6  Dambar — Pit cannot extend a ll the way across
the bar.
6. 11    Mold   Locating   Holes   —   Conv entional   mold
damage  design  dictates  that  gating  is  opposite  pin  #1;
therefore,  the  mold  locating  holes  must  be  in  the  rail
adjacent  to  pin  #1.  In  order  to  minimize  gate  flashing
between the mold and the rail edge, a specific tolerance
of ± 0.051 mm (0.002&quot;) is required from the centerline
of the mold hole to the opposite rail edge.
6. 12   Strip  Length  —  Strip  length  cu t  off  shall  be
within 0.005&quot;, lead tip to lead tip centerline (excluding
rails).  The  rail  cut  off  length  shall  be  within  +  0.635
mm (0.025&quot;) unless otherwise specified by the user.
7  Sampling
Sampling  will  be  determined  between  supplier  and
purchaser.
8  Packaging and Marking
8. 1   Packaging  —  Leadframes  mus t  be  packaged  in
containers designed and constructed to prevent damage
and/or   contamination.   Specific   protection   must   be
provided  against  crushing,  exposure  to  moisture,  and
mixture gases.
8. 2   Marking  —  The  outer  containe rs  shall  be  clearly
marked to identify the user stock number, user purchase
order  number,  drawing  number,  supplier  lot  number,
and    reel    numbers    within    the    carton.    Additional
information required should be specified by the user.
