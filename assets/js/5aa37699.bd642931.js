Therefore,  CarrierOut  may  also  be  used  with  the  CarrierRelease\ncommand.  If  CarrierHold  is  Host  Release,  then  the  carrier  shall  be  kept  at  the  write  position  until  an  CarrierRelease  service\nrequest is received, regardless of when a CarrierOut is sent.  If CarrierHold is set to Equipment Release, then the CarrierRelease\nrequest has no effect.\n18  Additional Events\n18. 1  This section identifies data collection events that are not related to State transitions for variable data items. The\nintent of this section is to ensure certain data is available for specific events that are not related to state transitions,\nnot  to  define  all  the  additional  collection  events  for  CMS.  Also,  all  state  transitions  in  CMS  state  models  are\nrequired to have associated event reports.\n18. 2  Buffer Capacity Changed Event\n18. 2.1  An  event  shall  be  generated  whenever  Buffer  Capacity  changes.  This  applies  to  all  internal  buffers  and\ninternal buffer partitions.\n18. 2.2  Data required to be available for this event report:\n\u2022 BufferPartitionInfo.\n18. 3  Carrier Approaching Complete Event\n18. 3.1  In some cases, for carrier transfer efficiency, the host needs to know carrier completion timing a little faster\nthan actual. For example:\n\u2022 If the equipment is internal buffer type, QTAT carriers need to be moved out directly from internal FIMS to a\nload port to shorten moving out time.\n\u2022 If  the  equipment  uses  non-product  carriers,  such  as  dummy,  they  need  to  be  changed  before  it  becomes  not\nreusable to prevent stopping the equipment operation.\n\u2022 If  the  equipment  uses  non-product  carriers,  such  as  test,  reject,  they  need  to  be  changed  before  it  becomes\nempty or full to prevent stopping the equipment operation."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E87-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1999, 2005 40\n18. 3.2  This event shall be generated when the access by the equipment to the carrier is approaching complete. How\nthe timing of the event is determined shall be configurable.\n18. 3.3  Detailed  definition  of  the  event  timing  depends  upon  the  type  of  usage  of  the  carrier.    Some  examples  of\nevent timing for different types of usage are shown below.\n18. 3.3.1  PRODUCT \u2014 When remaining time until the carrier starts moving from internal FIMS to internal buffer\nreaches the configurable variable time (internal buffer equipment only).\n18. 3.3.2  DUMMY  \u2014  When  remaining  times  until  substrates  of  the  carrier  becomes  not  reusable  reaches  the\nconfigurable variable times.\n18. 3.3.3  TEST  \u2014  When  remaining  substrates  until  the  carrier  becomes  empty  reaches  the  configurable  variable\nnumber.\n18. 3.3.4  REJECT \u2014 When remaining slots until the carrier becomes full reaches the configurable variable number.\n18. 3.4  Suppliers  shall  document  the  interpretation  and  the  configurable  variable(s)  in  the  equipment  specification\ndocument.\n18. 3.5  Data required to be available for this event report:\n\u2022 CarrierID\n18. 4  Carrier Clamped Event\n18. 4.1  An  event  shall  be  generated  whenever  a  carrier  is  clamped.    Clamped  means  the  load  port  has  engaged  a\ndevice  that  would  inhibit  removal  or  movement  of  the  carrier  by  any  entity  external  to  the  load  port.    Some  load\nports may include more than one clamping device.  This event should be generated only when the first clamping is\nengaged.  This applies to all load ports.\n18. 4.2  There  is  no  standard  for  when  load  ports  clamp  a  carrier.    Therefore  the  IC  makers  host  systems  and\npersonnel will need some signal from the equipment to know if a carrier is clamped.  This event provides that signal.\nThis applies to all load ports that provide clamping.  If a load ports does not clamp the carrier no event is required.\n18. 4.3  Data required to be available for this event report:\n\u2022 Port ID,\n\u2022 Carrier ID (if available), and\n\u2022 Location ID.\n18. 5  Carrier Closed Event\n18. 5.1  If the carrier is equipped with a door, an event shall be generated when a carrier door has been closed.\n18. 5.2  Data required to be available for this event report:\n\u2022 CarrierID,\n\u2022 LocationID, and\n\u2022 PortID (if valid).\n18. 6  Carrier Location Change Event\n18. 6.1  An  event  shall  be  generated  whenever  a  carrier  has  changed  location.  This  applies  to  both  load  ports,\nsubstrate ports, and internal buffer locations.\n18. 6.2  Data required to be available for this event report:\n\u2022 CarrierID,\n\u2022 LocationID (new destination location), and\n\u2022 CarrierLocationMatrix."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E87-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1999, 2005 41\n18. 7  Carrier Opened Event\n18. 7.1  If the carrier is equipped with a door, an event shall be generated when a carrier door has been opened.\n18. 7.2  Data required to be available for this event report:\n\u2022 CarrierID,\n\u2022 LocationID, and\n\u2022 PortID (if valid).\n18. 8  Carrier Unclamped Event\n18. 8.1  An  event  shall  be  generated  whenever  a  carrier  is  unclamped.    Unclamped  means  that  the  load  port  has\ndisengaged  any  devices  that  would  inhibit  removal  or  movement  of  the  carrier  by  any  entity  external  to  the  load\nport.  Some load ports may include more than one clamping device.  This event should be generated only when all\nclamping or locking devices are disengaged.\n18. 8.2  There  is  no  standard  for  when  load  ports  unclamp  a  carrier.    Therefore  the  IC  makers  host  systems  and\npersonnel  will  need  some  signal  from  the  equipment  to  know  if  a  carrier  is  unclamped.      This  event  provides  that\nsignal.    This  applies  to  all  load  ports  that  provide  clamping  and  unclamping.    If  a  load  ports  does  not  clamp  and\nunclamp the carrier no event is required.\n18. 8.3  Data required to be available for this event report:\n\u2022 Port ID,\n\u2022 Carrier ID (if available), and\n\u2022 Location ID.\n18. 9  CarrierID Read Fail Event\n18. 9.1  An event shall be generated when the equipment attempts to read a carrierID and fails at a port in the NOT\nASSOCIATED STATE.\n18. 9.2  Data required to be available for this event report:\n\u2022 PortID\n18. 10  ID Reader Available Event\n18. 10.1  An event shall be generated whenever an id reader becomes available.  This applies to all load ports.\n18. 10.2  Data required to be available for this event report:\n\u2022 Port ID\n18. 11  ID Reader Unavailable Event\n18. 11.1  An event shall be generated whenever an id reader becomes unavailable for any reason.
