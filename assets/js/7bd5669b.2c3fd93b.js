Each quality characteristic shall beassigned an acceptable quality level (AQL) and lot totalpercent defective (LTPD) value in accordance withANSI/ASQC Z1.4 definitions for critical, major, andminor classifications. If desired and so specified in thecontract or order, each of these classifications mayalternatively be assigned cumulative AQL and LTPDvalues. Inspection levels shall be agreed upon betweenthe supplier and the purchaser. 10 Test Methods10.1 Table 1 of SEMI M18 contains a complete listingof ASTM, DIN, and JEIDA/JIS test methods that mayapply to the testing of specified premium siliconwafers. These attributes are listed in the order they arefound in the specification (which corresponds to theorder in SEMI M18).10.2 Conductivity Type  Use any of the methods inASTM Test Methods F 42, JIS H 0607, or DIN 50432for confirming the conductivity type of silicon waferscovered by this specification.10.3 Dopant  Confirm the dopant of high resistivitysilicon by the photoluminescence method of ASTMTest Method F 1389 or by the low-temperature infraredmethod of ASTM Test Method F 1630 or DIN 50438/3.10.4 Resistivity  Determine the electrical resistivityof the wafer in accordance with ASTM Test Method F673 or DIN 50445 (eddy current), or ASTM TestMethod F 84, JIS H 0602, or DIN 50431 (four pointprobe) using a suitable fixture to hold the wafer. 10.5 Carrier Recombination Lifetime  Determine inaccordance with F 1535 or JEIDA 53.10.6 Oxygen Content  Determine the interstitialoxygen content of wafers with resistivity greater than afew ohm-cm by infrared absorption. ASTM TestMethod F 1188 is the method that was used inanalyzing the results of the international round robinexperiment that established the IOC-88 conversioncoefficient. DIN 50438/1 provides improved proceduresof correcting for back surface roughness and multipleinternal reflections. ASTM Test Method F 1619, basedon work carried out in JEIDA (JEIDA 61) and SEMIJapan, is an alternative procedure for significantlyreducing errors associated with these two phenomena.10.7 Carbon Content  For all but very heavily dopedepitaxial substrates, establish the carbon content inaccordance with ASTM Test Method F 1391, JEIDA56, or DIN 50438/2.10.8 Total Bulk Iron  No standardized test methodexists for direct determination of total bulk iron contentin silicon. ASTM Test Method F 978 can be used fordirect determination of the electrically active iron.Extensions of the surface photovoltage method (ASTMTest Method F 391) and of the microwave lifetimemethod (ASTM Test Method F 1535) have beenreported in the literature to provide information on totalbulk iron content of boron-doped silicon; both theseextensions are based on the iron-boron pairing process.10.9 Structural Characteristics  When feasibleobserve crystal defects such as dislocation etch pits,slip, lineage, twins, etc., in accordance with ASTM TestMethod F 1725, JIS H 0609, or DIN 50434. Thesemethods are destructive, and with the exception of JISH 0609 are based on chromium-containing etchants.Some structural defects, especially slip, can bedetermined nondestructively by means of X-raytopographic analysis in accordance with DIN 50443/1.Swirl and oxidation induced stacking faults (OSFs) arebest observed after heat treatment such as thosespecified in ASTM Practice F 1726. However, the heatcycles in this practice were developed for 100 mmwafers and are not suitable for 300 mm wafers.Accordingly, thermal cycles used shall be agreed uponbetween supplier and purchaser. For observation ofOSFs, a 2-hour heat treatment at 1100C in steam isrecommended. Observe shallow pits in accordance withASTM Practice F 1049.10.10 Diameter  Diameter may be determined inaccordance with ASTM Test Method F 613 or DIN50441/4. Because notched wafers do not have flats, it isnot necessary to make the measurements along theparticular diameters identified in ASTM Test Method F613; rather it is suggested that measurements be made"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 2 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M24-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1994, 20035 along the diameter perpendicular to the ","<","100",">","orientation fiducial axis (0 in the coordinate systemspecified in SEMI M20), the diameter 120 counter-clockwise, and the diameter 240 counterclockwise.However, a more precise method of determining thediameter is to find the circle that best fits the circum-ference of the wafer by a least squares method; thediameter of the wafer is twice the radius of this circle.10.11 Flat Orientation  Determine in accordancewith ASTM Test Method F 847.10.12 Flat Length  Determine in accordance withASTM Test Method F 671.10.12.1 If flat diameter is specified instead of flatlength, determine in accordance with Section 5.2.1 ofDIN 50441/4 or by a dial gauge method (see NOTE 8)as agreed upon between supplier and purchaser.10.13 Notch Dimension  Determine the depth andangle of the fiducial notch in accordance with ASTMTest Method F 1152 with the use of a wafer holdingfixture appropriate for silicon wafers.10.14 Notch Orientation  No test method forverifying the crystal axis of the orientation fiducial axisof notched wafers has yet been standardized.Accordingly, test procedures for making thisdetermination shall be agreed upon between supplierand purchaser. A starting point may be an extension ofASTM Test Method F 847 with fixturing appropriate tonotched wafers.10.15 Edge Profile Shape  Determine the suitabilityof the edge profile in accordance with ASTM TestMethod F 928 or DIN 50441/2.10.16 Edge Surface Finish  Establish the surfacefinish of the edge region of the wafer by a methodagreed upon between supplier and purchaser.10.17 Thickness, Center Point  Determine thickness,center point may in accordance with ASTM TestMethod F 533, JIS H 0611, or DIN 50441/1; specialjigs or fixtures may be needed to allow the probe toreach the center point of the wafer.10.18 Total Thickness Variation  Determine inaccordance with ASTM Test Method F 533, ASTMTest Method F 657, DIN 50441/1, and JIS H 0611.NOTE 2: ASTM Test Method F 533, DIN 50441/1, and JISH 0611 are all 5-point methods, while Test Method F 657involves a continuous scan pattern. JIS H 0611 differs fromASTM Test Method F 533 and DIN 50441/1 in that themeasurements in JIS H 0611 are taken at the center and at 5mm from the edge on diameters parallel and perpendicular tothe major flat, while the measurements in the latter two testmethods are taken at the center and at the same radial distance(R nominal - 6 mm) on diameters 30 degrees and 120 degrees counterclockwise from the bisector to the primary flat ornotch (with the wafer facing front surface up).10.19 Surface Orientation  Determine the crystal-lographic orientation of the wafer surface in accordancewith ASTM test methods F 26, JEIDA Method 18, orDIN 50433 using a suitable fixture to hold wafer.10.20 Bow and Warp  Determine bow in accordancewith ASTM Test Method F 534 and warp in accordancewith ASTM Test Method F 1390 or Test Method F 657.NOTE 3: ASTM has standardized two methods formeasuring warp. ASTM Test Method F 1390 is an automated,non-contact method which provides for correction of thewafer deflection due to gravitational effects. The scan patterncovers the entire fixed quality area. ASTM Test Method F657 is a manual, non-contact method which has a continuous,prescribed scan pattern which covers only a portion of thewafer surface. There is no provision for correction of thewafer deflection due to gravitational effects. As noted inAppendix 2, different reference planes are used for the twomethods. Because Test Method F 657 employs a back surfacereference plane, the measured warp may include contributionsfrom thickness variation of the wafer. Test Method F 1390employs a median surface reference plane and is notsusceptible to interferences from thickness variations. Ingeneral, Test Method F 1390 is preferred, especially forwafers 150 mm in diameter and larger, although ASTM TestMethod F 1530 may also be used for this determination.10.21 Sori  If sori is specified in lieu of bow or warpor both, determine by a method agreed upon betweenthe supplier and the purchaser.NOTE 4: Because sori is a property of the top surface of anunclamped wafer, it may be measured on many types offlatness measuring instruments. ASTM Test Method F 1451may, in principle, be used for determination of sori.10.22 Flatness  Determine by a method agreed uponbetween the supplier and the purchaser. It isrecommended that site flatness is determined inaccordance with ASTM Test Method F 1530 using asite-by-site front surface reference (indicated by theacronym SFQR in the Flatness Decision tree (see SEMIM1, Figure A1-1)). The percent usable area (PUA) shallbe calculated as the percentage of the total number offull sites within the FQA that meet the specification.10.23 Surface Metal Contamination  Determinesurface metal contamination by a method agreed uponbetween supplier and purchaser; ASTM Test Method F1617 is suitable for sodium and aluminum, and ASTMTest Method F 1526 is suitable for chromium, iron,nickel, copper, and zinc at the specified levels. Other,more sensitive methods may also be utilized byagreement between supplier and purchaser.10.24 Back Surface Gloss  Determine test method inaccordance with ASTM D523 or JIS Z8741 using a 60degree of incidence and referencing the zero to a mirror"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 3 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M24-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1994, 2003 6 polished wafer front surface instead of reference glosssurface as described in these feat method. 11 Surface Defect Criteria11.1 Front surface defect criteria are shown in Item 8in attached specification tables.11.2 Minimal Conditions or Dimensions  Theminimal conditions or dimenions for defects statedbelow shall be used for determining wafer acceptability.Anomalies smaller than these limits shall not beconsidered defects.11.2.1 area contamination  Any foreign matter onthe surface in localized areas which is revealed underthe inspection lighting conditions as discolored,mottled, or cloudy appearance resulting from smudges,stains, water spots, etc.11.2.2 crack  Any anomaly conforming to thedefinition and greater than 0.25 mm (0.010 inch) intotal length.11.2.3 crow's foot  Any anomaly conforming to thedefinition and greater than 0.25 mm (0.010 inch) intotal length.11.2.4 dimple  Any smooth surface depressiongreater than 3 mm in diameter.11.2.5 edge chip and indent  Any edge anomaly,including saw exit marks, conforming to the definitionand greater than 0.25 mm (0.010 inch) in radial depthand peripheral length.11.2.6 hand scribe mark  Any mark such as thatcaused by a diamond scribe that is visible under diffuseillumination.11.2.7 haze  Haze is indicated when the image of anarrow beam tungsten lamp filament is detectable onthe polished wafer surface.

Critical surface LLS size should be the half of CD, however, tools are not well established. 65nm count limit was transferred to 90 nm count limit using draft international standard: ISO/DIS 14644-1 which follows the equation: 90 nm LLScounts per wafer = 65 nm LLS counts per wafer /(90 nm /65 nm)2 .NOTE 7: LLSs for Furnace & Thermal Process and Lithography & Patterning: New concept is proposed for LLSs for Furnace and ThermalProcess. The critical surface LLS size for prime wafer is proposed as a half size of CD in IRTS Roadmap. The half of CD is not necessarilyrequested for monitor test wafers. In actual business, an additional specification of LLS, the size of which is around CD is used, however, the sizeis not standardized. TF proposes the additional LLS size as the same size as CD.

This document does notintend to establish manufacturing procedures forcalibration wafers.Note 1: This specification might be used as the basis formaking calibration substrates with other materials and/orsurfaces. 2 Scope2.1 Bare silicon wafers on which latex-spheres of aknown diameter are deposited are used as standards forthe calibration of bare wafer inspection systems. Theresponse curve of the systems is generated for thecalibration of the systems with respect to the sizing ofpolystyrene latex (PSL) spheres, not for counting them. 3 Referenced Documents3.1 SEMI StandardSEMI M1  Specifications for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon Wafers 4 Terminology4.1 Light-Point Defect (LPD)  An isolated, localizedeffect on the wafer surface or in the substrate wafersresulting in increased light scattering intensity above athreshold (unit LSE).Note 2: LPD is a general term and it includes for examplelatex spheres and other localized surface irregularities. 4.2 Latex-Sphere Equivalent (LSE)  The size unit ofan LPD expressed as the diameter of a latex-spherewhich scatters the same amount of light as the LPD.This is indicated by adding LSE to the length unitused, e.g., 0.2 m LSE.Note 3: Sizing may be different for other materials and shapesthan PSL spheres because of the different optical designs ofinspection systems. 4.3 Response Curve (RC)  The relation betweenmeasured scattered light intensity and latex-spherediameters for a calibration surface inspection system. The RC depends on the light source used and maycontain non-monotonic regions.4.4 LPD histogram  The distribution of the counts ofLPDs per unit length over their size as expressed inLSE. 5 Requirements5.1 Substrates  The wafers used as substrates for thedeposition of latex-spheres must be bare silicon with anative oxide surface and they have to meet therequirements of SEMI M1. In addition to the M1specification, the surface conditions (for example,roughness) must be in compliance with Section 5.5.2.Note 4: The substrate wafer must be measured before latexsphere deposition with the same type of instrument to ensurethat the conditions of 5.5.2 are fulfilled. 5.2 Latex-Spheres  The latex-spheres used must becertified with respect to their diameter and they must betraceable to the Standard Reference Materials (SRM) ofthe National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST), former National Bureau of Standards (NBS).The certification methodology must be in accordancewith the technologies used by NIST.Note 5 : If the PSL are not traceable to NIST, the certificationmethod should be fully documented. 5.3 Range of Latex-Sphere Diameters  The diametersof the latex-spheres used for calibration must beselected so that the measurement range for the intendedapplication is covered. Sufficient latex-spherediameters must be used to achieve the requiredaccuracy of the RC.Note 6: For surface inspection systems using laser lightsource(s), it is recommended to avoid latex-sphere diameterscorresponding approximately to the wavelength of the laserused and its multiples of the laser used. 5.4 Density of Latex-Spheres Deposited  The densityof the deposited latex-spheres, full or partial wafercoverage, must be selected in such a way that the peakof the histogram of the latex-sphere diameters is at least100% above the background counts. It has to beverified that the indicated (relevant) peak in thehistogram is generated by single, isolated latex-spheresof the specified diameter.

The detection limitdepends on the equipment and measurement conditions.It is expected that many users of this test method canreduce the detection limit to 10 14 cm-3 level. 77Kmeasurement is effective to reduce the detection limit.In the case of 77K measurement, the upper limit is 1.3 10 16 cm-3 , as described in the following article:T.Arai et al : J. Electronic Industry, Vol. 30, 9(1988) 38 2.3 The test method utilizes the re lationship betweencarbon concentration and absorption coefficient at 580cm-1 for room temperature measurement (around 582cm-1 for 77K measurement), the infrared absorptionband is associated with substitutional carbon in GaAs.These specific absorption bands in GaAs have beenassociated with the local vibration mode of Cas.2.4 The method is applicable to Se mi-Insulating (SI)GaAs. Slices can be any crystallographic orientationand should be polished or lapped and etched on bothsurfaces.2.5 This test method is intended to be used with FT-IRspectrometers that are equipped to operate in the regionincluding the wave number range from 700 to 500 cm-1 .2.6 This standard may involve haz ardous materials,operation, and equipment.

This calibration coefficient is used to calculatethe carbon concentration of specimens. 5.3 For room temperature measure ment, a baseline isdrawn in the differential spectrum (after subtraction ofthe reference sample spectrum) from which anabsorption coefficient is derived. The range of baselineshould be wider than \xb1 10 cm-1 . The baseline has to bedetermined in an interval of the spectra which is neitherinfluenced by main peak at 580 cm-1 nor the side peakat 576 cm-1 . For 77K measurement, the range ofbaseline should be wider than \xb1 1.5 cm-1 . 6 Significance and Use6.1 Carbon plays an important role in thedetermination of the compensation mechanism whichdetermines the semi-insulating behavior of GaAs. Assuch the concentration is critical in determining thesubstrate resistivity.6.2 As a dominant acceptor in SI-G aAs substrates,carbon could, potentially impact ion implantationactivation. 7 Interferences7.1 Stray light that reaches the det ector will tend toreduce the calculated absorption coefficient value andthereby reduce the reported carbon concentration.7.2 FT-IR instrument instruction m anuals should beconsulted if problems with the technique are suspected.7.3 The carbon absorption band ha lf width at roomtemperature must be less than 2 cm-1 for acceptablemeasurement results. Excessive width can be due toimproper thickness matching or stress.7.4 Specimens that do not exceed the instrument beamsize will cause error. Use of apertures, or preferablybeam condensers, can correct this problem.7.5 The minimum detection level of this method islimited by the signal-to-noise ratio of the recording. 8 Apparatus8.1 FT-IR with an operating range that includes theregion of 700 to 500 cm-1 . Instrument resolution orspectral resolution at the carbon absorption band of 580cm-1 for room temperature measurement and around582 cm-1 for 77K measurement must not exceed 0.5 cm-1 , which means the effective resolution afterapodization must not exceed 1.0 cm-1 .8.1.1 Beam sizes and sample holder active areas forboth the specimen and the reference must be within10% of each other.8.2 Instrument suitable for thickne ss measurement toan accuracy of 0.0025 mm."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 38 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M30-0997 \xa9 SEMI 1997 4 8.3 Holders for these test and refer ence specimens thatprevent any source of infrared radiation from bypassingthe specimen.8.4 For use at 77K, low-temperatu re cryostat capableof maintaining the specimen and reference at 77Ktemperature with suitable window materials (refer toASTM Practice F 120).8.5 Equipment and materials for s licing and polishingGaAs to a final thickness tolerance of 0.005 mm or less,and a total thickness variation of 0.01 mm or less. 9 SamplingUnless otherwise specified, a GaAs slice used for thecarbon test is to be measured at the nominal slicecenter.

However, this standard has beenwritten so that injection-molded plastic FOSBs can be manufactured in conformance with it, and those can beutilized for maintaining wafers quality during transportation, opening and closing the door.2.2 This standard assumes that the FOSB is used in the last process in wafer manufacturing, in acceptance andinspection, and in transferring the wafers from the FOSB to a FOUP, FOBIT or open cassette inside an ICmanufacturing facility. The FOSB is not intended to be used in IC manufacturing processes. It is recommended thatwafers be transferred from the FOSB to a FOUP, FOBIT or open cassette using automated methods. As described in5.4, the purchaser needs to specify which type of FOSB door is required:1) Manual door as described in 5.4.1; or2) Automatedshippable door as described in 5.4.2.2.3 This standard is provisional.

All required convex features may also have a radius of up to r66 to prevent smallcontact patches with large stresses that might cause wear and particles. Note that these limits on the radius of allrequired features are specified as a maximum (not a minimum) to ensure that the required features are not roundedoff too much. The lower bound on the radius is up to the FOSB supplier. Note also that this radius applies to everyrequired feature unless another radius is called out specifically. Here a required feature is an area on the surface ofthe FOSB supplier. Note also that this radius applies to every required feature unless another radius is called outspecifically. Here a required feature is an area on the surface of the FOSB specified by a dimension (or intersectionsof dimensions) that has a tolerance and not just a maximum or minimum (such as the edges of the robotic handlingflange).5.4 Door  It is recommended that the FOSB not be vertical when it is opened or closed. When the FOSB is in avertical orientation with the door removed, the wafers must be restrained from touching each other by appropriatewafer support design or other retaining techniques.5.4.1 Manual Door  If chosen, the manual door option requires no automation to open the door. An exclusionzone surrounding the manual door area is specified in the standard. There are several possible techniques for sealingand clamping the manual door that meet user requirements. Therefore, only an exclusion zone surrounding themanual door area is specified in this standard. All features of the door and door retaining mechanism must lie withinthe exclusion zone illustrated in Figure 1 and must not interfere with other specified features (including thekinematic couplings). Figure 1 and dimensions x81, y50, y81, y82, z47, z48 and z49 define the manual door area andtherefore apply only to the manual door option as described in this section. The y81 dimension applies from thehorizontal datum plane to the top surfaces of the FOSB (z47-z48 or z47+z49 at the upper door frame volumespecified by y50).5.4.2 Automated-shippable Door  If chosen, the automated-shippable door must be designed to mate with a portthat conforms to SEMI E62. However, following characteristics of automate-shippable door must be considered.5.4.2.1 Wafer Retaining Structure  The slot is usually designed that wafers are suspended in the slot withoutcontacting the surface of the slot for preventing the damage during transportation when FOSB door is closed. Itshould be noted that wafer position of FOSB is different from that of FOUP when the door is closed due to the waferretaining structure.5.4.2.2 Rear of Door (y51)  For manual door, FOSB has a y51 \u2265 50 mm to hold wafers in large area at frontwafer retainer for keeping wafer quality during transportation. For automated-shippable door, FOSB has ay51\u2265 140 mm to comply with SEMI E47.1.5.4.2.3 Force between Box Door and Box (f34: defined by SEMI E62)  f34 is related to wafer retaining forcethough, need to consider door is pulled by latching too. Even though, f34 is increased, minimum force applied towafer would be recommended for eliminating damage to the wafers in dynamic motion for opening and closing thedoor.5.4.2.4 Latch Key Torque (f30: defined by SEMI E62)  The required latch key torque depends on the closingforce.5.4.2.5 A FOSB with an automated-shippable door should be able to withstand a force when applied to one of theretaining features of up to 40N (f61) in any direction without negative impact to the intended function of the FOSB(e.g. shell deformation, wafer positions, door closing capabilities).5.5 Seal Zones for Door  In the Front Opening Shipping Box Automated Door Option the automated box door ison the front side of the box (corresponding to the front side of the carrier where wafers are accessed so the door isperpendicular to the wafers and parallel to the facial datum plane). The automated door and the carrier frame musthave surfaces that mate with the seal zones defined in SEMI E62. Specifically, the FOSB automated box dooroption and the carrier frame must have surfaces that made with the seal zones and the reserved spaces for vacuumapplication (which includes all of the circles bounded by r38 except for the holes for the registrations at the center ofeach circle) defined in 5 of SEMI E62 (which specifies r38 as well as the seal zone dimensions). These automateddoor and frame surfaces must be a distance of y52 from the facial datum plane and must have a flatness of y42. Nosurface on the automated door may project further from the facial datum plane than the door seal zone and thereserved spaces for vacuum application. The automated door must also be designed so that when the box is pressedagainst the FIMS port, both latch keys on the port are inserted to their full length. Furthermore, when the latch keys"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 45 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M31-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1998, 20055 are turned more than 45\xb0 toward the position that unlocks the automated door from the box, the latch key holes onthe door must be such that the door is not removable from the latch keys. There are no door seal zone requirementsfor the manual door option, but a FOSB with the manual door must contain a frame seal zone that meets the frameseal zone requirements specified in this section.5.6 Wafer Retaining  When the FOSB is closed, the wafers must be retained in the FOSB to prevent movementduring subsequent handling, including shipping. It should be noted that wafers are typically shipped in a verticalorientation and generally require support from a secondary package. It is recommended that this secondary packagebe designed to allow for easy removal of the FOSB from the secondary package. Figure 1Manual Door Area 5.7 Wafer Orientation and Numbering  The wafers must be horizontal when the FOSB is placed on the coupling,and the wafers slots are numbered in increasing order from bottom to top (so the bottom wafer is wafer number 1,the next wafer up is wafer number 2, etc.).5.8 Internal Horizontal Dimensions  Figure 2 shows a cross-section of the horizontal boundaries of the FOSBside domains (which contain the parts of the FOSB higher than z6 above the horizontal datum plane and lower thanz15 above the top wafer).

Notethat z8 (the height of the bottom nominal wafer seating plane above the horizontal datum plane) and z12 (thedistance between adjacent nominal wafer seating planes) are given as absolute distances with no tolerance. Thismeans that the sum of actual height variations in the FOSB from the kinematic coupling to the supporting featuresholding each wafer must be contained within the tolerance of z10 with no further stack-up at each higher wafer. Themethod for meeting this requirement is left up to the FOSB supplier. Table 2 defines all dimensions for Figures 3through 7.

The top of this cylindricalsection is z11 above the nominal wafer seating plane and its bottom is z10 above the nominal wafer seating plane.The implications for wafer positioning of the tolerance on r2 are as follows. The wafers should be placed in theFOSB within a circle of radius corresponding to the smaller bound on r2 to avoid touching the edge of the wafer tothe side of the FOSB. Once the wafer has been placed, the FOSB must not allow a wafer to move outside of a circleof radius corresponding to the larger bound on r2. There are two exceptions to this limit on wafer movement. Whenthe wafer is pushed toward the rear of the FOSB, the location of the wafer is defined by the wafer pick-up volume(see 5.9.3). When the FOSB is gently tilted forward up to 45\xb0, the wafers may slide forward, but it is recommendedthat they not extend further than y20 from the facial datum plane. This may be accomplished by designing the teethsupporting the wafers to include a wafer stopper at the front that is outside of r2 and under z29 as illustrated inFigure 6.5.9.2 Wafer Extraction Volume  The open space for the wafer extraction volume includes a cylindrical sectionwith radius r3 and a main axis parallel to and y1 in front of the nominal wafer center line. The top of this cylindricalsection is z11 above the nominal wafer seating plane and its bottom is z23 above the nominal wafer seating plane.The wafer extraction volume also includes the extrusion out the front of the FOSB of this cylindrical section and theportion of the wafer set-down volume above z29. The implications for wafer extraction of the definition ofdimension r3 (r3 \u2265 r2 + 1) are as follows. The FOSB must give an extra 1 mm (0.04 in.) of horizontal clearanceonce the wafer is picked up from wherever it ends up (within the bounds of r2) after transport in the FOSB."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 48 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M31-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1998, 2005 8 Figure 6Features That Prevent Wafer Creep-Out Figure 7Lower Cross-Section at Facial Datum Plane z8 = 44 x3 \u2265 125 z12 = 10 z12 = 10 bilateraldatumplane horizontaldatum plane z6\u2264 32 bottomnominalwaferplane Waferz10= \xb10.5z29 \u2264 0.7 z12 = 10 z11 \u2265 6front side of the FOSB where wafers are accessed"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 49 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M31-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1998, 20059 5.9.3 Wafer Pick-Up Volume  If a wafer is placed in the wafer set-down volume and is then pushed toward therear of the FOSB, then the entire bottom of the wafer must be contained in the wafer pick-up volume. However, ifthe wafer is not pushed toward the rear of the FOSB, then the wafer may only be somewhere within the waferextraction volume. The wafer pick-up volume is defined by a cylindrical section with radius r1 and a main axis atthe nominal wafer centerline. Its top and bottom are the upper and lower tolerance of z10 around the nominal waferseating plane.5.10 Pitch and Capacity  Table 1 shows the different options with regard to the wafer pitch (spacing) and theFOSB capacity.
