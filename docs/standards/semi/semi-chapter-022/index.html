Information is not an official part of SEMI E4 (SECS-I)
and  is  not  intended  to  modify  or  supercede  the  official

R1-1  Miscellaneous Notes on SECS-I
R1-1.1 Layered  Protocol  (see  Section 1.3.1)  —  The
lnternational     Standards     Organization     (ISO)     has
published  a  model  for  Open  Systems  lnterconnection
(OSI). The SECS-I protocol both predates the ISO/OSI
model  and  is  not  a  true  &quot;open  system&quot;  and,  therefore,
does not correspond exactly to the ISO/OSI model. The
SECS-I  protocol  is  a  communications  interface  rather
than  a  network  protocol.  However,  the  SECS-I  levels
can  be  roughly  compared  to  layers  1  through  part  of
layer  5  of  the  ISO/OSI  model.  ISO/OSI  layer  1,  the
physical link layer, corresponds to the SECS-I physical
link.  ISO/OSI  layer  2,  the  data  link  layer,  corresponds
to the SECS-I block transfer protocol. lSO/OSI layer 3,
the  network  layer,  is  a  function  of  the  host  and  is  not
defined  in  SECS-I  beyond  the  provision  for  a  bi-
directional  flow  (see  Section  6.2).  Similarly,  network
management  is  assumed  to  be  the  responsbility  of  the
host. ISO/OSI layer 4, the transport layer, is covered by
the  SECS-I  block  transfer  protocol,  duplicate  block
detection,  and  the  message  protocol.  ISO/OSI  layer  5,
the  session  layer,  is  partially  covered  by  the  SECS-I
message protocol.
R1-1.2 Single Timer for T1 and T2 (see Section 5.3) —
A  single  timer  can  be  used  for  both  the  inter-character
timer  and  the  protocol  timer,  since  both  are  the  time
between receiving successive characters and both limits
are never in effect at the same time.
R1-1.3 Stalling  (see  Section 5.8.2)  —  The  line  control
portion  of  the  block  transfer  protocol  has  the  ability  to
delay the acceptance of a data block by not responding
with an EOT immediately after receiving an ENQ. Such
an  action  by  the  receiver  is  called  &quot;Stalling.&quot;  If  the
delay  exceeds  the  sender&#x27;s  T2  value,  the  sender  will
send  another  ENQ.  This  can  be  continued  depending
upon the sender&#x27;s setting of T2 and RTY. Such a delay
should  be  an  occasional  convenience  to  accommodate
random short delays in the receiver&#x27;s ability to accept a
new block and should not be counted upon routinely to
make  up  for  poor  response.  In  particular,  the  block
transfer  protocol  should  probably  have  at  least  two
buffers  available  for  storing  incoming  blocks.  This
allows   one   block   to   be   inspected   by   the   message
protocol  while  the  next  block  is  being  received,  thus
allowing  a  reasonably  continuous  reception  of  data.  If
both buffers are full and the message protocol is slow in
freeing  the  buffer  for  the  block  transfer  protocol,  then
the block transfer protocol will start stalling the sender.
If  the  sender  is  stalled  long  enough,  it  will  declare  a
send  error,  which  is  probably  the  correct  thing  to  do.
The  sender  cannot  distinguish  between  a  reluctance  to
receive  and  failure  in  the  communications.  In  either
situation,    since    no    block    gets    through    in    a
predetermined  time  limit,  the  communications  link  is
effectively   broken.   Arbitrarily   long   delays   are   not
acceptable in SECS-I.
R1-1.4 Determining  the  Cause  of  an  NAK  (see  Section
5. 8.5) —The block transfer protocol does not include a
way for a sender to determine the cause of an NAK. If
such  information  is  useful  for  application  purposes,  it
must be collected at the receiving end.
R1-1.5 Master  Sending  a  Long  Message  (see  Section
5. 8) —When the master is sending a long message, the
slave  may  be  unable  to  send  a  block,  which  may  result
in   timeouts.   It   is   good   practice   for   the   master   to
introduce enough delay between blocks so that the slave
has a chance to send a block every few seconds.
R1-1.6 Device   Identification   (see   Section 6.3) —
Although  the  15  bits  of  the  device  ID  can  identify
32,767  different  devices,  the  host  may  find  it  more
convenient  to  use  the  upper  seven  bits  to  identify  the
type  of  device  such  as  a  spinner  or  diffusion  furnace,
and  to  use  the  lower  eight  bits  to  identify  the  specific
device of that type.
R1-1.7 Sending  Multiple  Open  Messages  (see  Section
7. 2.4)  —The  message  protocol  algorithms  defined  in
the  standard  are  capable  of  inter-leaving  the  blocks  of
any  number  of  open  multi-block  messages.  Since  the
receiving  protocol  is  sensitive  to  the  time  between
blocks  of  each  message  being  received,  it  is  proper
procedure   for   the   sending   algorithm   to   alternate
between     messages     when     sending     blocks     from
interleaved multi-block messages.
R1-1.8 Single  Timer  for  T3  and  T4  (see  Sections 7.3.2
and 7.4.3) — For a given transaction, a single timer can
be  used  for  both  the  inter-block  timer  and  the  reply
timer,   since   both   are   the   time   between   receiving
successive  blocks  of  a  message,  and  both  limits  are
never in effect at the same time.</p><p>SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 199914

RS-232 Isolation Example</p><p>SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 199915
R1-2  Isolation
R1-2.1  As  mentioned  in  Section  3.4,  the  standard  RS-
232-C  line  does  not  provide  isolation  between  the
grounds of remote equipment and a central computer. It
is   often   desirable   to   provide   isolation   to   minimize
communications  errors  and  to  protect  equipment.  The
following  example  is  provided  here  to  illustrate  how
such   an   isolation   might   be   provided   between   two
devices   using   RS-232-C,   while   at   the   same   time
providing  the  capability  to  drive  longer  lines.  This
description  is  provided  for  information  only  and  is  not
part of the standard.
R1-2.2  Figure  R1-1  illustrates  a  possible  circuit  for
isolation  which  provides  line  isolation  and  line  driving
capability. The two wires used to provide power to the
remote  isolator  are  required  since  any  local  power
supply  would  have  the  same  isolation  problems  as  the
data   wires.   The   power   wires   also   eliminate   extra
supplies  at  every  terminal  or  remote  device.  There  are
many  other  possible  circuits.  This  example  has  been
used successfully and works quite well at 9600 baud for
lines less than 300 meters and illustrates the use of the
voltages on pins 18 and 25 as mentioned in 3.2.4.
R1-3  Examples of Block Transfer Protocol
R1-3.1  Figures  R1-2  and  R1-3  illustrate  some  simple
message    interactions    between    the    host    and    the
equipment. Figure R1-2 shows the handshake sequence
possible to acquire the status of the equipment. Fig-ure
R1-3 shows the sequence of events when both the host
and the equipment try to send at the same time.

Contention Resolution
R1-4    Use  of  Buffers  in  the  Block  Transfer
Protocol
R1-4.1  In the flow chart of the Block Transfer Protocol
(Figure  2),  the  flow  chart  entry  &quot;LISTEN&quot;  implies  that
characters  are  recognized  after  entering  the  given  state
and  not  before.  If  the  particular  implementation  uses
buffers  and  stores  all  of  the  characters  received  before
the  &quot;LISTEN&quot;  state  is  achieved,  care  must  be  taken  in
the  proper  handling  of  the  data  in  the  buffer  to  avoid
problems  due  to  &quot;timing  windows&quot;  between  sending
and receiving.
R1-4.2    If  the  buffer  is  cleared  before  sending  the  last
character prior to the &quot;LISTEN&quot; (last checksum byte in
sending a message, ENQ or EOT in line control), there
is  still  a  time,  albeit  small,  where  spurious  characters
could be received into the buffer.
R1-4.2.1      In   addition,   during   the   sending   of   the
message, a delay between the checksum bytes while the
buffer  is  cleared  may  cause  an  inter-character  timeout
by  the  receiver.  If  the  buffer  is  cleared  after  the  last
character   sent   before   the   &quot;LISTEN,&quot;   there   is   a
possibility  that  the  desired  character  will  be  cleared
from the buffer.
R1-4.3    One  solution  is  to  look  at  the  buffer  after
entering   the   &quot;LISTEN&quot;   state   and   examine   the   last
character  in  the  buffer,  if  any  are  there.  This  works
while listening for an EOT after sending an ENQ. In the
case  where  the  sender  is  listening  for  an  ACK  after
sending  the  second  checksum  byte,  it  is  possible  that
the  receiver  also  has  a  block  to  send,  and  follows  the</p><p>SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 199916
ACK  immediately  with  an  ENQ.  In  this  case  the  last
character in the buffer might be an ENQ, and so the last
two   characters   should   be   examined.   If   an   ACK
precedes  the  ENQ,  then  it  should  be  assumed  that  the
block  was  sent  successfully,  and  the  ENQ  should  be
saved for establishing line control (i.e., send an EOT, or
an ENQ if there is contention).
R1-4.4    The  handling  of  the  buffer  when  listening  for
the length byte is not improved by this suggestion. The
buffer should be cleared after the ENQ is received and
before  the  EOT  is  sent.  Spurious  characters  received
before the length byte will cause a send failure.

Possible Bock Header Structure
R1-5  System Bytes
R1-5.1    This  section  presents  a  sample  scheme  for
generating  and  managing  the  system  bytes  field  of  the
block header. There are many possible implementations
which  meet  the  requirements  of  SECS-I.  This  section
describes one of those implementations.
R1-5.2    Source  ID  and  Transaction  ID  —  The  system
bytes  are  divided  into  two  parts,  a  source  ID  and  a
transaction ID, as shown in Figure R1-4.
R1-5.3      Distinct   source   IDs   are   assigned   to   each
application  level  originator  of  primary  messages  in  a
host or equipment. This allows a secondary message to
be  routed  to  the  source  of  the  corresponding  primary
message  of  the  transaction.  The  transaction  ID  is  an
integer  that  is  incremented  for  each  primary  message
sent  by  the  SECS-I  interface.  It  is  the  same  for  all
blocks of a multi-block message.
R1-5.4  Actions — When a SECS-II message is passed
to  the  SECS-I  protocol,  the  least  significant  bit  of  the
lower message ID is examined to determine whether the
message is primary (bit 1 = 1) or secondary (bit 1 = 0)
message.  If  the  message  is  primary,  transaction  ID  is
generated  and  placed  in  the  transaction  ID  portion  of
the   system   bytes.   One   method   for   generating   the
transaction   ID   is   to   start   with   a   value   of   0   upon
initialization,   and   increment   by   1   for   each   new
transaction,  starting  with  1  (not  0)  when  the  largest
transaction  ID  value  has  been  used.  At  the  same  time,
the  application  sender&#x27;s  source  ID  is  placed  in  the
source ID portion of the system bytes. If the message is
secondary, the system bytes are the same as those of the
corresponding  primary  message.  It  is  assumed  that  the
application generating the reply can identify the reply to
the message protocol, which has saved the system bytes
from the primary message.
R1-5.5    Block  Send  Failures  (see  Sections 5.8.2  and
6. 8.1) — Since it is a requirement that the system bytes
be  distinct  from  those  used  in  blocks  that  were  not
successfully  sent  since  the  last  successful  block  send,
the  use  of  two  bytes  for  the  transaction  ID  would
effectively satisfy the requirement by allowing for up to
65,536 consecutive block send failures.
R1-6  Using SECS in a Network
R1-6.1    The  SECS  standard  can  be  used  to  control  the
flow of data within a network of computers. A network
is   an   interconnection   of   computers   or   intelligent
controllers   communicating   with   one   another   over
communications  lines.  Each  intelligent  entity  is  a  node
of  the  network.  Each  node  may  have  a  number  of
connections to other members of the network.
R1-6.2  One connection of equipment and computers is
in  the  form  of  a  tree  network  with  the  processing
equipment  at  the  ends  of  branches  as  shown  in  Figure
R1-5.  Intermediate  Nodes  A  and  B  service  like  pieces
of  equipment;  i.e.,  all  the  furnaces  to  Node  A,  all
masking to Node B, and so on, for more nodes.
R1-6.3  Node A monitors the three stations 1A, 2A, and
3A.  Node  A  handles  most  of  the  normal  requirements
of  coordinating  1A,  2A,  and  3A.  Node  A  receives
instructions   from   Node   C   regarding   the   behavior
desired  from  1A,  2A,  and  3A.  A  CRT  or  operator
interface connected to Node A is shared by 1A, 2A, and
3A. Any node can direct messages up or down the tree.
A  message  such  as  an  alarm  can  be  sent  from  1A  to
Node  A  and  from  Node  A  to  Node  C  which  might  be
considered  the  host  of  the  network.  Node  A  might  be
part  of  a  system  supplied  by  a  company  which  has  its
own  communications  scheme  for  devices  tied  to  Node
A. As long as the company provides one connection to
Node  A  which  is  consistent  with  this  standard,  then</p><p>SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 199917
Node A and its attached equipment can be connected to
the host, Node C, and collectively be called one node.
Figure R1-5
Tree Network
R1-6.4  This tree structure can be extended even further
as    shown    in    Figure    R1-6    to    include    multiple
manufacturing  plants  at  remote  sites.  However,  the
primary   intent   of   this   standard   is   to   address   the
communication  between  processing  equipment  and  a
host.  At  higher  levels  of  the  tree,  the  message  is
combined  with  more  system  level  messages  and  more
computer   file   manipulations.   At   these   levels,   the
communications  may  require  more  complex  or  higher
speed  standards.  Thus,  the  SECS  line  is  intended  to  be
used  within  one  integrated  circuit  manufacturing  area
rather  that  between  general  purpose  computer  centers,
although  its  only  limitations  for  such  a  use  would  be
speed.
Figure R1-6
Extended Tree Network for a Large Organization
R1-6.5    The  tree  network  is  characterized  by  the  fact
that  there  is  only  one  possible  path  between  any  two
nodes  in  the  network.  This  feature  makes  handling
messages  in  the  tree  network  relatively  easy  when
compared    to    networks    where    more    than    one
communication  path  exists  between  nodes.  In  these
latter  networks,  the  nodes  must  make  some  judgment
about   which   path   to   take,   perhaps   based   on   the
conditions  of  the  lines  or  on  the  destination  of  the
message.
R1-6.6    The  device  ID  and  the  R  (Reply)  bit  play  an
important  role  in  directing  messages  in  the  network.
Each  node  of  the  three  maintains  a  table  of  the  device
below  it.  From  the  device  code,  it  knows  on  which
branch to send the data. When a message is going from
the central node toward the device, the R-bit is set to 0.
When  a  message  is  being  sent  from  the  device  up  the
tree, the R-bit is set to 1. When a node sees the R-bit set
to  1,  the  message  must  take  the  one  communication
direction that goes up the tree structure. Thus, the R-bit
serves  to  direct  messages  up  the  tree  or  down  the  tree,
depending   on   its   value.   At   any   given   node,   this
behavior may be explained in Figure R1-7.
Figure R1-7
Message Handling at a Node by Using the R-Bit
R1-7  The General Node Transaction Protocol
R1-7.1    The  transaction  protocol  has  three  primary
functions.    First,    it    coordinates    the    receiving    of
messages  that  arrive  in  multiple  blocks.  Second,  it
provides   a   mechanism   for   matching   primary   and
secondary  messages.  Third,  it  does  error  detection  on
incomplete  messages  whether  they  are  due  to  a  break
during multiple blocks or a lack of reply messages. The
third  function  is  vital  to  the  maintenance  of  a  working
system,  as  can  be  seen  from  the  following  discussion.
Once  a  transaction  is  begun  with  the  first  block  of  a
primary message, the receiving machine will have some
memory    allocated    to    buffering    or    pointing    to
interpreting    modules.    If    the    transaction    remains
incomplete  for  some  reasonable  length  of  time,  it  may</p><p>SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 199918
be assumed that an error has occurred and the receiving
machine  should  release  any  memory  it  may  be  holding
for the transaction. If memory were to remain allocated
to  incomplete  transactions,  conceivably  the  receiving
machine could run out of available memory and would
be unable to function properly. For this reason, the error
detection of incomplete transactions is an essential part
of the message transaction protocol in SECS-I.
R1-7.2  The message transaction protocol is based on a
system of timers called transaction timers. These timers
are  maintained  in  software  and  are  associated  with  a
given  transaction.  Once  a  transaction  is  begun,  there
will exist a timer on the time interval between all blocks
of  the  transaction  independent  of  the  direction  of  the
message.  The  machine  that  expects  to  receive  a  block
has the burden of timing and error detection. Timers are
required  in  any  machine  that  (1)  makes  a  request  and
expects  to  receive  data  back;  (2)  must  receive  multiple
block   requests;   or   (3)   sends   data   and   expects   an
acknowledgement.   A   machine   may   require   several
transaction timers if it can conduct multiple transactions
at  one  time  on  one  port  or  has  multiple  ports.  A
message  timer  will  exist  for  each  link  involved  in  the
transaction.  This  allows  the  error  detection  to  identify
the particular link which has failed.
R1-7.3    A  general  algorithm  can  be  constructed  to
handle  an  arbitrary  number  of  SECS  ports.  Such  an
algorithm  is  presented  in  the  form  of  a  flow  chart  in
Figure  R1-8.  There  is  one  such  algorithm  for  each
device ID. The algorithm handles all SECS data blocks
that  enter,  leave  or  pass  the  device  ID.  A  new  block
causes  the  procedure  to  be  executed  starting  from  the
point  marked  &quot;block  in&quot;  and  continues  until  the  point
marked  &quot;block  out.&quot;  The  block  of  data  will  then  be
directed to the proper destination.
R1-7.4  This algorithm makes use of a stored version of
the message header for each transaction being handled.
The stored header may be visualized as shown in Figure
R1-9.  The  stored  header  has  two  system  areas  and  an
associated  transaction  timer.  The  two  system  areas  are
required to keep the incoming and the outgoing system
areas  independent  in  coding,  yet  related  in  meaning.
The two system areas are referred to by the state of the
R-bit  in  the  message  block  header.  One  area  is  related
to R = 0 and the other R = l. When a prime message is
received that requires a reply, the system bytes from the
block are stored in the system area corresponding to the
opposite  state  of  the  R  bit  on  the  message.  When  the
reply  is  sent,  the  system  bytes  are  used  from  the  store
system  bytes  corresponding  to  the  same  R-bit  as  the
reply. The system area corresponding to the same R-bit
as  the  message  is  called  OUTSYS  while  the  system
area   corresponding   to   the   opposite   R-bit   is   called
INSYS.
R1-7.5  When a block is presented to this algorithm, the
first  task  is  to  determine  if  the  block  is  part  of  an
ongoing    transaction,    the    first    block    of    a    new
transaction,  or  some  other  unknown  block.  This  test  is
accomplished  by  comparing  the  header  of  the  block
with the stored headers. If a match is not found, then a
check is made to see if the block is the first of a primary
message.  If  this  is  true,  then  a  new  header  is  added  to
the  stored  header  list.  If  the  primary  message  is  only
one  block  long  and  requires  no  reply,  then  no  stored
header is created. When a match is found, the algorithm
modifies  the  stored  header  so  that  it  will  look  like  the
next  block  of  the  transaction  to  be  expected.  On  all
blocks  requiring  a  stored  header,  except  the  last,  a
transaction  timer  is  set  to  a  timeout  value  prior  to
sending the block to its destination. The last part of the
algorithm  directs  the  block  to  its  destination  or  detects
an error in the destination.
R1-7.6   Error   recovery   is   an   important   part   of   the
algorithm   to   ensure   that   the   system   will   remain
operational  in  spite  of  bad  data  blocks.  For  any  block
that  does  not  pass  the  tests  described  in  the  algorithm,
the header of the message is saved and sent in the host
direction on a Stream 9 error message. This information
can  be  useful  in  tracking  down  the  source  of  the  error.
Another   type   of   error   occurs   when   one   of   the
transaction  timers  times  out.  Such  an  error  message
means  that  the  transaction  has  been  interrupted.  An
error  message  is  formed  which  sends  the  stored  header
in the host direction on Stream 9. The stored header and
the  timer  are  then  released.  This  procedure  aids  in
keeping   software   cleared   and   ready   in   case   of
difficulties in the network.</p><p>SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 199919

1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  The  SEMI  Equipment  Communications  Standard
Part 2 (SECS-II) defines the details of the interpretation
of  messages  exchanged  between  intelligent  equipment
and  a  host.    This  specification  has  been  developed  in
cooperation    with    the    Japan    Electronic    Industry
Development Association Committee 12 on Equipment
Communications.</li><li>1.1  It   is   the   intent   of   this   standard   to   be   fully
compatible   with   SEMI   Equipment   Communications
Standard E4 (SECS-I).  It is also the intent to allow for
compatibility     with     alternative     message     transfer
protocols.  The details of the message transfer protocol
requirements are contained in Section 6.</li><li>1.2  It is the intent of this standard to define messages
to  such  a  level  of  detail  that  some  consistent  host  soft-
ware may be constructed with only minimal knowledge
of  individual  equipment.    The  equipment,  in  turn,  may
be  constructed  with  only  minimal  knowledge  of  the
host.</li><li>1.3  The messages defined in the standard support the
most  typical  activities  required  for  IC  manufacturing.
The  standard  also  provides  for  the  definition  of  equip-
ment-specific  messages  to  support  those  activities  not
covered by the standard messages.  While certain activ-
ities can be handled by common software in the host, it
is  expected  that  equipment-specific  host  software  may
be   required   to   support   the   full   capabilities   of   the
equipment.
2  Scope</li><li>1  SECS-II   gives   form   and   meaning   to   messages
exchanged   between   equipment   and   host   using   a
message transfer protocol, such as SECS-I.</li><li>1.1  SECS-II    defines    the    method    of    conveying
information between equipment and host in the form of
messages.        These    messages    are    organized    into
categories  of  activities,  called  streams,  which  contain
specific  messages,  called  functions.    A  request  for
information  and  the  corresponding  data  transmission  is
an example of such an activity.</li><li>1.2  SECS-II  defines  the  structure  of  messages  into
entities  called  items  and  lists  of  items.    This  structure
allows  for  a  self-describing  data  format  to  guarantee
proper interpretation of the message.</li><li>1.3  The interchange of messages is governed by a set
of  rules  for  handling  messages  called  the  transaction
protocol.    The  transaction  protocol  places  some  mini-
mum requirements on any SECS-II implementation.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  SECS-II applies to equipment and hosts used in the
manufacturing of semiconductor devices.  Examples of
the  activities  supported  by  the  standard  are:  transfer  of
control   programs,   material   movement   information,
measurement data, summarized test data, and alarms.</li><li>1.1  The   minimum   compliance   to   this   standard
involves meeting the few constraints outlined in Section</li></ol><h1>8</h1><ol start="8"><li>It  is  expected  that  a  given  piece  of  equipment  will
require  only  a  subset  of  the  functions  described  in  this
standard.  The number of functions and the selection of
functions  will  depend  upon  the  equipment  capabilities
and  requirements.    For  each  piece  of  equipment,  the
exact  format  for  each  function  provided  must  be  docu-
mented according to the form outlined in Section 10.</li><li>1.2  It  is  assumed  that  the  equipment  will  define  the
messages used in a particular implementation of SECS-
II.    It  is  assumed  the  host  will  support  equipment
implementation.

6  The Message Transfer Protocol
6. 1  Intent  —  SECS-II  is  fully  compatible  with  the
message transfer protocol defined by SECS-I.  It is the
intent  of  this  standard  to  allow  for  compatibility  with
alternative  message  transfer  protocols.    The  purpose  of
this   section   is   to   define   the   requirements   of   the
interaction  between  an  application  using  SECS-II  and
the  message  transfer  protocol.    The  methods  used  to
implement these requirements are not covered as a part
of  this  standard.    The  terms  used  in  this  standard  are
those   used   by   SECS-I.      Equivalent   terms   may   be
different for other message transfer protocols.
6. 2  Messages — The message transfer protocol is used
to  send  messages  between  equipment  and  host.    The
message transfer protocol must be capable of sending a
primary    message,    indicating    whether    a    reply    is
requested;  and,  if  a  reply  is  requested,  it  must  be
capable   of   associating   the   corresponding   secondary
message  or  reply  message  with  the  original  primary
message.    The  term  originator  will  refer  to  the  creator
of  the  original  primary  message.    The  term  interpreter
will   refer   to   the   entity   that   interprets   the   primary</p><p>SEMI E5-1104 © SEMI 1982, 2004 4
message  at  its  destination  and  generates  a  reply  when
requested.
6. 3  Blocking  Requirements  —  The  message  transfer
protocol  must  support  the  following  SECS-II  message
blocking requirements.
6. 3.1  Single-Block  Messages  —  SECS-II  requires  that
certain  messages  be  sent  in  a  single  block  or  single
packet   by   the   message   transfer   protocol.      Those
messages   defined   in   this   standard   as   single-block
SECS-II  messages  must  be  sent  in  a  single-block  or
packet.  The method used by the application software to
tell   the   message   transfer   protocol   that   a   particular
message must be sent as a single block is not covered as
part  of  this  standard.    For  compatibility  with  SECS-I,
the maximum length allowed for a single-block SECS-
II message is 244 bytes.  The minimum requirement for
the  message  transfer  protocol  is  to  be  able  to  send
single-block SECS-II messages.
6. 3.2  Multi-Block  Messages  —  For  compatibility  with
SECS-I,  SECS-II  messages  that  are  longer  than  244
bytes  are  referred  to  as  multi-block  messages.    Also,
certain SECS-II messages are allowed to be multi-block
messages  even  if  they  otherwise  meet  the  single-block
length  requirements.    Certain  older  implementations
may impose application-specific requirements on block
sizes  for  certain  incoming  messages.    Beginning  with
the 1988 revision of the standard, new applications may
not    impose    application-specific    requirements    on
incoming   block   sizes.      Applications   implemented
before 1988 may impose such requirements.
6. 4  Message Header — The message transfer protocol
must   provide   the   following   information,   called   the
message header, with every message.  Only the content
of the message header is defined by this standard.  The
exact format of the message header passed between the
application  and  the  message  transfer  protocol  is  not
covered as part of this standard.
NOTE 1:  In SECS-I, this information is contained in the 10-
byte header of each block of a message.
6. 4.1  Device ID — The message transfer protocol must
be  capable  of  identifying  the  device  ID  (0–32767)
which indicates the source or destination of a message.
6. 4.2  Stream  and  Function  —  The  message  transfer
protocol  must  be  capable  of  identifying  to  SECS-II  a
minimum15-bit message identification code.  In SECS-
II,  messages  are  identified  by  a  stream  code  (0–127,  7
bits)   and   a   function   code   (0–255,   8   bits).      Each
combination of stream and function represents a distinct
message identification.
6. 4.3  Reply    Requested    —    The    message    transfer
protocol must be capable of identifying whether a reply
is requested to a primary message.
6. 5  Transaction  Timeout  —  It  is  presumed  that  the
message  transfer  protocol  will  notify  SECS-II  in  the
event  of  failure  to  receive  an  expected  reply  message
within a specified transaction timeout period.
NOTE 2:  In SECS-I, a transaction timeout occurs if either the
reply timeout (T3) is exceeded before the first block of a reply
message  is  received  or  if  the  inter-block  timeout  (T4)  is
exceeded  before  an  expected  block  of  a  multi-block  message
is received.
6. 6  Multiple   Open   Transactions   —   This   standard
allows,  but  does  not  require,  the  support  of  more  than
one concurrent open transaction.
7  Streams and Functions
7. 1  Streams  —  A  stream  is  a  category  of  messages
intended to support similar or related activities.
7. 2  Functions — A function is a specific message for a
specific activity within a stream.  All the functions used
in   SECS-II   will   follow   a   numbering   convention
corresponding to primary and secondary message pairs.
All  primary  messages  will  be  given  an  odd-numbered
function  code.    The  reply  message  function  code  is
determined  by  adding  one  to  the  primary  message
function  code.    The  even-numbered  function  following
a  primary  message  which  requests  no  reply  is  reserved
and is not to be used.  Function code 0 is reserved in all
streams   for   aborting   transactions   as   described   in

8  Transaction and Conversation Protocols</li><li>1  Intent —    For    an    implementation    to    be    in
compliance  with  SECS-II,  it  must  meet  the  minimum
transaction  requirements  outlined  in  this  section.    The
conversation  protocols  serve  to  further  define  the  use
and interaction between transactions.</li><li>2  Transaction  Definition  —  A  transaction  forms  the
basis  for  all  information  exchanges  in  SECS-II.    A
transaction  consists  of  either  a  primary  message  for
which  no  reply  is  requested,  or  a  primary  message
which  requests  a  reply  together  with  its  corresponding
secondary   message.      Secondary   messages   cannot
request a reply.</li><li>3  Transaction  Level  Requirements  —  The  following
are   the   requirements   to   comply   with   the   SECS-II
protocol at the transaction level:</li></ol><h1>1</h1><ol><li>Respond   to   S1F1   with   S1F2   as   described   in
Section 10.5.</li></ol><h1>2</h1><ol start="2"><li>For any received message that cannot be processed
by   the   equipment,   send   the   appropriate   error
message  on  Stream  9.    As  described  in  Section</li><li>13, S9F1, F3, F5, F7, or F11 are possible.</li></ol><h1>3</h1><ol start="3"><li>Format any other supported messages according to
Section 10.</li></ol><h1>4</h1><ol start="4"><li>Upon  detection  of  a  transaction  timeout  at  the
equipment, send S9F9 to the host.</li></ol><h1>5</h1><ol start="5"><li>Upon  receipt  of  function  0  as  a  reply  to  a  primary
message,  terminate  the  related  transaction.    No
error  message  should  be  sent  to  the  host  by  the
equipment.</li><li>4  Conversation  Protocols  —  A  conversation  is  a
series  of  one  or  more  related  transactions  used  to
complete   a   specific   task.      A   conversation   should
include  all  transactions  necessary  to  accomplish  the
task and leave both the originator and interpreter free of
resource commitments at its conclusion.</li><li>4.1  Conversation Timeout — A conversation timeout
is   used   to   indicate   that   a   conversation   has   not
completed   properly.      A   conversation   timeout   is
application-dependent,   and   the   methods   used   for
detecting conversation timeouts are not covered as part
of this standard.  A conversation timeout will terminate
further  action  on  the  conversation,  and  will  allow  for
the   clearing   of   any   committed   resources.      Upon
detection  of  a  conversation  timeout  at  the  equipment,
S9F13 should be sent to the host.</li><li>4.2  Types of Conversations — There are seven types
of   conversations   which   characterize   all   information
exchanges in SECS-II:</li><li>A  primary  message  with  no  reply  is  the  simplest
conversation.  This message must be a single-block
SECS-II message.  The originator must assume that
the  interpreter  responds  to  the  message.    This
conversation  is  used  where  the  originator  can  do
nothing if the message is rejected.</li><li>If the interpreter has data that the originator wants,
the data are requested with a primary message and
the   data   returned   to   the   originator   as   a   reply
message.      It   is   assumed   that   the   originator
requesting   the   data   is   prepared   to   receive   the
amount  of  data  returned.    This  is  the  request/data
conversation.</li><li>If  the  originator  wishes  to  send  data  in  a  single-
block  SECS-II  message  to  the  interpreter,  then  the
originator    sends    the    data    and    expects    an
acknowledgment  from  the  interpreter.    This  is  the
send/acknowledge conversation.</li><li>If   the   originator   has   a   multi-block   SECS-II
message to send for a particular exchange, then the
originator   must   receive   permission   from   the
interpreter  prior  to  sending  the  data.    The  first
transaction  requests  permission  to  send,  and  the
interpreter  either  grants  or  denies  permission.    If</li></ol><p>SEMI E5-1104 © SEMI 1982, 2004 6
permission is granted, the originator sends the data
and  the  interpreter  replies  appropriately.    This  is
the   inquire/grant/send/acknowledge   conversation.
Between  the  inquire  and  the  send,  the  interpreter
may  commit  some  resources  in  preparation  for  the
data.  Consequently, a conversation timeout may be
set  by  the  interpreter  at  a  time  dependent  upon  the
application,  at  which  time  the  interpreter  will  free
its  resources  and  send  an  S9,F13  error  message  to
the  originator.    Note  that  under  the  definition  of
S9,F13 in this standard, only the equipment should
generate  an  error  message  to  the  host  under  these
conditions.
5. There  is  a  conversation  related  to  the  transfer  of
unformatted data sets between equipment and host.
This  conversation  is  described  in  detail  in  Stream</p><h1>13</h1><ol start="13"><li>(See Section 10.17)</li></ol><h1>6</h1><ol start="6"><li>There  is  a  conversation  related  to  the  handling  of
material  between  equipment.    This  conversation  is
described in detail in Stream 4.  (See Section 10.8)</li></ol><h1>7</h1><ol start="7"><li>The  originator  may  request  information  from  the
interpreter  which  requires  some  time  to  obtain
(e.g.,   operator   input   is   required).      The   first
transaction    requests    the    information    and    the
interpreter  responds  in  one  of  three  ways:  1)  the
information is returned, 2) the interpreter indicates
that the information cannot or will not be obtained,
or  3)  the  interpreter  indicates  that  the  information
will  be  obtained  and  returned  in  a  subsequent
transaction, as specified for this conversation.  For
case  number  3,  the  interpreter  will  initiate  the
subsequent  transaction  when  the  information  is
available.</li><li>4.2.1  Case    3    is    the    request/acknowledge/send/
acknowledge transaction.</li><li>4.2.2  The   originator   of   the   request/acknowledge/
send/acknowledge   conversation   may   commit   some
resources   in   anticipation   of   the   send/acknowledge
transaction.  Consequently, a conversation timeout may
be  set  by  the  originator  at  a  time  dependent  on  the
application.    On  timeout,  the  originator  will  free  its
resources    and    restart    the    conversation    with    the
‘request’,  or  send  an  S9,F13  error  message.    Note  that
under the definition of S9,F13 in this standard, only the
equipment should generate an error message to the host
under these conditions.</li><li>4.3  The key words, request, data, send, acknowledge,
inquire, and grant are used in the function names as an
aid   to   understanding   the   relationship   between   the
messages  and  the  conversation.    Single  message  trans-
actions do not use these words.
9  Data Structures</li><li>1  Intent —  All  information  transmitted  according  to
this  standard  will  be  formatted  using  two  data  struc-
tures,  items  and  lists.    These  data  structures  define  the
logical  divisions  of  the  message,  as  distinct  from  the
physical  divisions  of  the  message  transfer  protocol.
They  are  intended  to  provide  a  self-describing  internal
structure  to  messages  passed  between  equipment  and
host.</li><li>2  Item  —  An  item  is  an  information  packet  which
has  a  length  and  format  defined  by  the  first  2,  3,  or  4
bytes of the item.  These first bytes are called the item
header  (IH).    The  item  header  consists  of  the  format
byte  and  the  length  byte(s)  as  shown  in  Figure  2.    Bits
one  and  two  of  the  item  header  tell  how  many  of  the
following  bytes  refer  to  the  length  of  the  item.    This
feature allows for long items without requiring the byte
overhead  for  shorter  items.    The  item  length  refers  to
the  number  of  bytes  following  the  item  header,  called
the item body (IB), which is the actual data of the item.
The  item  length  refers  only  to  the  item  body  not
including the item header, so the actual number of bytes
in the message for one item is the item length plus 2, 3,
or  4  bytes  for  the  item  header.    All  bytes  in  the  item
body are in the format specified in the format byte.

Length refers to the number of bytes except in a list format where it
refers to the number of elements
(items or lists) in the list.</li></ol><p>Figure 2
Item and List Header</p><ol start="9"><li>2.1  A  zero-length  in  the  format  byte  is  illegal  and
produces  an  error.    A  zero-length  in  the  item  length
bytes  has  a  special  meaning  as  defined  in  the  detailed
message definitions.</li><li>2.2  Bits  3  through  8  of  the  format  byte  of  the  item
header define the format of the data which follows.  Of
the  64  possible  formats,  16  are  defined  as  shown  in
Table 1.  Format code 0 is called a list and is defined in
Section 9.3.  Format code 22 (octal) is called a localized
string and is defined in Section 9.4.  The remaining 14
item formats define unspecified binary, code 10 (octal);
Boolean, code 11 (octal); ASCII character strings, code
20   (octal);   JIS-8   character   strings,   code   21   (octal)</li></ol><p>SEMI E5-1104 © SEMI 1982, 2004 7
signed  integer,  codes  30,  31,  32,  34  (octal);  floating
point, codes 40, 44 (octal); and unsigned integer, codes
50,  51,  52,  54  (octal).    These  formats  are  used  for
groups  of  data  which  have  the  same  representation  in
order to save repeated item headers.  In signed integers,
negative   values   will   be   two’s   complement   values.
Floating   point   numbers   will   conform   to   the   IEEE
standard  754.    Boolean  values  will  be  byte  quantities,
with zero being equivalent to false, and non-zero being
equivalent to true.
9. 3  List —  A  list  is  an  ordered  set  of  elements,  where
an element can be either an item (Section 9.2) or a list.
The  list  header  (LH)  has  the  same  form  as  an  item
header  with  format  type  0.    However,  the  length  bytes
refer to the number of elements in the list rather than to
the number of bytes.  The list structure allows grouping
items  of  related  information  which  may  have  different
formats into a useful structure.
9. 3.1  A  zero-length  in  the  format  byte  is  illegal  and
produces an error.  A zero-length in the list length bytes
has  a  special  meaning,  which  is  defined  in  the  detailed
message definitions.

NOTE:  Changes  in  integer  format  codes  may  conflict  with  earlier
implementations.</p><ol start="9"><li>4  Localized  Character  String  Items  —  A  localized
character  string  is  an  item  which  is  used  for  repre-
senting a string of multi-byte characters.  Because there
are  many  different  encoding  schemes  and  the  informa-
tion  could  be  in  any  one  of  a  number  of  languages,
these  characteristics  must  also  be  included  in  the  item.
Thus  for  localized  character  strings  which  use  item
format  code  22  (octal),  there  is  an  additional  localized
string header (LSH) .</li><li>4.1  This  localized  string  header  follows  the  item
header  and  precedes  the  string.    The  localized  string
header  is  part  of  the  item  data,  thus  the  length  of  the
header  (2  bytes)  is  included  in  the  length  in  the  item
header.    The  length  of  the  localized  string  itself  is  the
number  of  bytes  that  it  occupies,  regardless  of  the
number  of  characters  that  represents  the  string.    The
localized  string  header  followed  by  the  string  together
comprise  the  localized  string  item.    For  example,  a  2
byte  localized  string  (which  may  represent  a  single
character), because of the 2 byte length of the localized
string  header,  will  have  a  4  byte  length  in  the  item
header.</li><li>4.2  The  LSH  is  a  16  bit  number  which  specifies  the
encoding  method  used  for  the  string.    Defined  values
for the encoding are as follows:

BLKDEF 31, 51   Block Definition
Blocks define the range for
before/after code checking
(specified by BCDS, IBCDS,
NBCDS, ACDS, IACDS, and NACDS).
BLKDEF specifies whether the
command being defined starts a
block (+1), terminates a block
(-1), or is within the body of a
block (0).  All other values are
invalid.  The outermost block of
a process program is implicit,
and is bounded by the first and
last command of the process
program.  Before/after checks
for a particular command are
performed with all other
commands in the same block and
at the same nesting level.  For
the purpose of before/after
checking, a set of commands
making up a block is considered
to be a single body command of
its containing block.  This
command has the before/after
restrictions of the start block
command which begins the block.

Parameter Default Value
Specifies default value and data
type of parameter.  If no
defaults are provided, item data
length will be zero.  For
numeric or Boolean data, the
default item may be a multi-
varied vector if the parameter
itself can be a vector.
If RQPAR is false:
Position of data in a default
item is significant.  When
obtaining a default value to be
used in the Nth position of a
vector parameter, the
value is obtained from the Nth
position of the default item.
If the default item has L
entries, no default value will
be provided for the L+1,...,PMAX
parameter entries.
If RQPAR is true:
The length of the default vector
(L) specifies the minimum number
of
entries which must be entered
for the parameter.  If &gt; PMAX,
only PMAX
entries are required.
