Originally published September 1999. 1 Purpose1.1 The Factory Labor Component provides thecapability to support the qualification and managementof available, qualified human resources for manufact-uring operations.1.2 The technical content of this b allot addresses theportion of the CIM Framework domain specified inSEMI E81, Provisional Specification for CIMFramework Domain Architecture, concerned withmanagement of the availability of qualified factorypersonnel. This specification provides the interfacesrequired by Manufacturing Execution Systems to: Configure the Person resource model. Each Persons name (or appropriate alias),identification, department, role, etc. Theremay be cases where identifying informationshould not be used to associate a person withthe required factory labor records. Each Persons initial skills and authorization toperform jobs and access data. Each Persons initial assignment to otherfactory resources (such as specific machines orfactory areas). Each Persons medical qualifications. Define skill maintenance tasks and what triggersthem. Track and report the Persons skills, authorization,and assignments and record these in the Personshistories. Support assignment of Persons to factory jobs andmonitor and record job progress (from theperspective of the Persons role). Monitor skill maintenance triggers (such as expiredskill certification) and recommend skill mainten-ance jobs. Execute triggered skill maintenance jobs. Change Person capabilities (before and aftertraining).  Execute and monitor skill maintenance jobs(training, certification testing) and report jobprogress. Record skill maintenance triggers and jobresults in Persons skill maintenance histories. Collect and report Person and skill performance(utilization and effectiveness). Maintain relationships between Persons and systemsecurity for identity authentication andauthorization. 2 Scope2.1 Specifically, this component p rovides the servicesto: Manage the assignment of qualified and availablelabor resources for factory operations. Manage the training and medical requirements forfactory operations. Support the maintenance of personnel information(full name, employee number, department, shiftassignment, machines qualified to operate, courseand medical examination records). Support the maintenance of personnel skill qual-ification histories (courses and medical examina-tions successfully completed) of factory personnel.2.2 The Factory Labor Componen t is divided into twosubcomponents: Person Management, which tracks, logs, and main-tains availability and task assignment for factoryoperations personnel within the manufacturingfacility. Also provides support for the managementof personnel information, training, and medicalqualifications. Skill Management, which provides support for themanagement of training and medical requirementsfor factory operations.2.3 Figure 1 depicts the relationsh ips between thesetwo components and their interaction with other CIMFramework components defined in the Section 7.2Functional Partitioning of SEMI E81, Provisional"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 2 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E86-0200 \xa9 SEMI 1999, 2000 2 Specification for CIM Framework DomainArchitecture.2.4 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use.

Persons are viewed as resour-ces in the manufacturing environment, are assigned to a factory area, and own a detailed training and medical exam-ination history (which qualifies them to perform a skill or set of skills). For example, there may be a requirementthat an operator periodically completes specific training or medical testing. Qualifications would include verifi-cation that required training had occurred within the specified time limit. The associated skill would identify theprocess capability enabled for this person through that qualification. At any given time, a Person may be assigned toone or more factory jobs associated with other factory resources or operations.6.3.2 The Component Information M odel for Person Management is shown in Figure 2.

This is especially true whenever there are a largenumber of objects of a given type or when the entities are transient rather than permanent. In both cases, it isdifficult to describe a general way for the host and equipment to specify which particular entity is referenced and toget information related only to a specific one out of many.7.1.2 By defining these entities as objects that comply with OSS, it is only necessary for the host to specify the typeof object and its specific identifier in order to inquire about one or more properties of the specific entity of interest.7.1.3 Object Properties7.1.3.1 A property (attribute) is information about an individual object that is presented as a name/value pair. Thename is a formally reserved text string that represents the property, and the value is the current setting for thatproperty.7.1.3.2 Properties shall be accessible to the host via the service GetAttr for the Carrier object. Using SEMI E39Object Services Standard, for example, it is possible to: get the list of IDs for the current carriers at the equipment, and get the specified properties for one or more individual carriers.7.1.4 Rules for Object Properties Attributes with RO access can not be changed using SetAttr service as defined in OSS. Attributes with RW access can be changed using SetAttr service as defined in OSS. Additional attributes may be specified by the user or the equipment supplier by using an attribute name startingwith UD (User Defined). Care should be taken to ensure the name of the attribute is unique.7.1.5 Object Attribute Table7.1.5.1 The object attribute table is used to list all the attributes related to the defined object as shown below theaccess is defined as Read only (RO) or Read/Write (RW). The REQD column is used to specify whether theattribute is required for implementation. Finally, the Form column is used to specify the format of that particularattribute.Table 1 Object Attribute Table Attribute Name Definition Access Reqd FormObjType Object type RO Y Text = Carrier"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 36 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E87-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1999, 20055 7.2 State Model Methodology7.2.1 A state model has three elements: definitions of each state and sub-state, a diagram of the states and thetransitions between states, and a state transition table. The diagram of the state model uses the Harel State Chartnotation. An overview of this notation is presented in an Appendix of SEMI E30. The definition of this notation ispresented in Science of Computer Programming 8, Statecharts: A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems, by D.Harel, 19871.7.2.2 State Model Requirements7.2.2.1 The state models included in this standard are a requirement for CMS compliance. A state model consists ofa state model diagram, state definitions, and a state transition table. All state transitions in this standard, unlessotherwise specified, shall correspond to collection events. More explicitly, there must be a unique collection eventfor each state transition.7.2.2.2 Equipment must maintain state models for each of the required state models as defined in this document.Equipment shall maintain individual and unique state models for each logical entity instantiated or physical entity inthe equipment that has state models associated with it. The event identifier reported during a particular statetransition change for each of these state models shall be shared for all associated state models but unique for eachtransition. For example, if the equipment has two load ports and the load port state model defines 10 transitions,there must be exactly 10 event identifiers for each load port transfer state model but not 10 for each physical loadport. The information identifying the physical entity or logical entity undergoing the transition will be containedwithin the associated event report.7.2.2.3 A state model represents the host's view of the equipment, and does not necessarily describe the internalequipment operation. All CMS state model transitions shall be mapped sequentially into the appropriate internalequipment collection events that satisfy the requirements of those transitions. In certain implementations, the equip-ment may enter a state and have already satisfied all of the conditions required by the CMS state model for transitionto another state. In this case, the equipment makes the required transition without any additional actions in thissituation.7.2.2.4 Some equipment may need to include additional sub-states other than those in this standard. Additional sub-states may be added, but shall not change the CMS defined state transitions. All expected transitions between CMSstates shall occur.7.2.2.5 Transition tables are provided in conjunction with the state diagrams to explicitly describe the nature of eachstate transition. A transition table contains columns for Transition number, Previous State, Trigger, New State,Actions, and Comments. The trigger (column 3) for the transition occurs while in the previous state. Theactions (column 5) includes a combination of: Actions taken upon exit of the previous state, Actions taken upon entry of the new state, and Actions taken which are most closely associated with the transition.7.2.2.6 When a state model is defined with multiple AND sub-states, the equipment may report all state entryevents with only one collection event. When conditional paths are defined in the state model, it is not necessary toreport any state transition(s) until a terminal state is reached at which time each transition used to reach that state isreported.Table 2 State Transition Table Num Previous State Trigger New State Actions Comments 1 Elsevier Science, P.

Request messages are initiated by a service user (e.g., the host).Request messages ask for data or an activity from the provider. Request messages expect a specific responsemessage (no presumption on the message content).7.3.3 Service Message Parameter Definition7.3.3.1 A service parameter dictionary table defines the description, range, and type for parameters used byservices, as shown in the following table:Table 4 Service Message Parameter Definition Table Parameter Name Form Description #1 A row is provided in the table for each parameter used on a service. 7.3.4 Service Message Definition7.3.4.1 A service message description table defines the parameters used in a service message.

Themessage sent by the initiator is called the Request. The receiver terms this message the Indication.

Thisdocument provides a standard interface for host/equipment communications regarding the transfer of carriers. Thestandardized carrier transfer host interface includes not only transfers to and from the external load ports, but alsotransfers to and from the internal buffer positions on internal buffer type equipment.8.2 Single Connection Requirement8.2.1 The expectation of the production equipment supplier is that this standard be implemented in conjunction withthe GEM interface to their production equipment and without the use of a separate communication connection. 9 Load Port9.1 A load port (port) is used by the factory to load and unload carriers to and from production equipment. A loadport may be used as an input load port, an output load port, or as an input/output load port, depending uponequipment type, configuration and/or factory practices. This classification may be fixed or it may be programmableby the user. A load port is generally designed to handle one specific carrier type, such as substrate cassettes,leadframe magazines, SMIF pods, or FOUPs.9.2 Load Port Numbering9.2.1 The load port number shall be assigned incrementally from the bottom left to bottom right, then top left to topright when facing the front of the equipment. The load port numbering requirement is to provide a commonreference base to external entities, such as humans.9.3 Carrier Slot Numbering9.3.1 The slot numbers for a carrier shall be assigned incrementally from the bottom, starting with 1.9.4 Load Port Resource Sharing9.4.1 A model of a load port must account for any mechanical assemblies that are either active during carriertransfer or are capable of interacting with the transfer. The load port is responsible for such mechanisms when theload port is in the TRANSFER READY state. If these mechanisms are shared with other load ports, then the sharingmust be coordinated.9.5 Load Port Transfer State Model9.5.1 The purpose of the Load Port Transfer State Model is to define the host view of a carrier transfer, whichincludes the host interactions with the equipment necessary to transfer carriers to and from equipment load ports.Each load port on the equipment shall maintain an independent instance of this state model.9.5.2 Load Port Transfer State Model Diagram9.5.2.1 Figure 1 is the diagram for the Load Port Transfer State Model."),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 39 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E87-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1999, 2005 8 9.5.3 Load Port Transfer State Definitions9.5.3.1 LOAD PORT TRANSFER  The super state for the IN SERVICE and OUT OF SERVICE states.9.5.3.2 OUT OF SERVICE  Transfer to/from this load port is disabled.

This state contains two sub-states, whichare used depending on whether or not a carrier is present on the load port (READY TO LOAD and READY TOUNLOAD).9.5.3.5 READY TO LOAD  A sub-state of TRANSFER READY. When transitioning to the TRANSFER READYstate, if a carrier is not present on the specified load port, this is the active sub-state. In this state, the load port isavailable to be loaded with an external carrier, or with a carrier that is currently located inside the equipment (i.e.internal buffer).9.5.3.6 READY TO UNLOAD  A sub-state of TRANSFER READY. When transitioning to the TRANSFERREADY state, if a carrier is present on the specified load port, this is the active sub-state. In this state, the load portis available for unloading of a carrier from the loadport to material handling equipment. When the load port is beingused by the equipment, the state shall transition to TRANSFER BLOCKED.9.5.3.7 TRANSFER BLOCKED  The carrier transfer state is neither READY TO LOAD nor READY TOUNLOAD.

This allows the host to exchange information with theequipment about one or more specific carriers using services defined in SEMI E39, Object Services Standard. Acarrier has properties (attributes) that are defined in Table 6, Carrier Attribute Definition.10.2 Object Instantiation10.2.1 The carrier object is a software representation of the carrier in the equipment. Under normal circumstancesthis object is instantiated by the equipment when the host uses the Bind or Carrier Notification service or when theequipment successfully reads the carrierID from the carrier. A carrier object is instantiated by carrierID read only ifthere are no currently existing objects with the carrierID just read. A carrier object can also be instantiated by eitherthe ProceedWithCarrier or CancelCarrier Services on an NOT ASSOCIATED port. (This implies a failed carrierIDread event.) The ContentMap attribute will be an empty list (a list of zero) when the instantiation is done byCarrierID read. The SlotMap attribute should be a list consisting of all slots enumerated as UNDEFINED whenthe carrier object is instantiated by CarrierID read.10.2.2 From the host point of view, an object is instantiated if the host is able to query the equipment about thatobject, it's current state, and other attributes. Once instantiated, the object is considered destroyed (no longerinstantiated) if the response to such queries is unknown object.10.2.3 Summary of carrier object instantiation:1. Bind or Carrier Notification or CarrierReCreate (with PropertiesList) service;2. CarrierID read with no currently existing carrier objects having the carrierID just read; and3. ProceedWithCarrier or CancelCarrier Service on an NOT ASSOCIATED port with a carrier.10.2.4 Carrier Object Identifier (ObjID)10.2.4.1 The purpose of an Object Identifier is to allow references to an object within the system. The objectidentifier is created when an object is instantiated and should be unchanged or persistent until the end of the objectlifecycle. The Object Identifier shall be unique at the equipment during lifecycle of the object.

The equipment is responsible for ensuring uniqueness of the Carrier ID prior toinstantiation by the bind service.10.2.5 Carrier Object Destruction10.2.5.1 Normally, the Carrier Object reaches the end of its lifecycle when the carrier is unloaded from theequipment. Abnormally, the Carrier Object reaches the end of its lifecycle when a CancelBind orCancelCarrierNotification service is executed prior to the carrier being loaded, or when an equipment based carrierverification fails following carrier instantiation by the bind service.10.2.5.2 Summary of carrier object destruction:1. A carrier is unloaded from the equipment;2. A CancelBind or CancelCarrierNotification service is received;3. An equipment based CarrierID verification fails after a carrier object was previously instantiated with a Bindservice (Equipment initiated CancelBind); and4. The host or operator has issued a CarrierReCreate service.10.3 Carrier Attribute Definitions10.3.1 The following table contains the attributes that are of importance to the host and/or the equipment in order tomanage the history and the reports about the carrier object.10.3.2 REQD Column10.3.2.1 All attributes in the following table are required to be associated with the carrier object and are alwaysmaintained and updated by the equipment (for example, if the equipment has a waferID reader, the equipment candetermine the ContentMap).10.3.3 ACCESS Column10.3.3.1 Even though a value may be marked as RO (read only), the initial value for the attribute may be providedby the host when attached to either the Bind or ProceedWithCarrier services.10.3.4 Carrier Attribute Definition TableTable 6 Carrier Attribute DefinitionAttribute Name Definition Access Reqd FormCapacity Maximum number of substrates acarrier can hold.RO Y Positive integer.

All other attributes, such as LocationID, shall be set and maintained by the equipment. The attributes, Capacity, ContentMap, Substrate count and Usage, shall be provided with Bind,CarrierNotification, or ProceedWithCarrier service before or when SlotMap is provided. The SlotMap shall be provided with Bind, CarrierNotification, or ProceedWithCarrier to verify CarrierID, whenthe SlotMap verification is equipment based. And it shall not be provided when the SlotMap verification is hostbased. Carrier properties may be provided before the carrier arrives as part of the Bind service and should be retaineduntil either a CancelBind service is received or the carrier is removed. Carrier properties may also be provided by the ProceedWithCarrier service. The carrier properties that areprovided by the ProceedWithCarrier service may differ based whether or not the object is instantiated by theservice. Carrier properties that are required shall be actively updated by the equipment.10.3.6 Carrier Location10.3.6.1 A carrier location, signified by LocationID, is used for tracking carriers as they move through theequipment. A carrier location is any physical area that is capable of holding a carrier. It is not intended to represententire mechanisms, which may have a variety of other properties of interest, but only that portion where a Carriermay rest.10.3.7 Carrier Location Examples10.3.7.1 Carrier Locations include load port locations, substrate port locations, internal buffer locations, as well asgrippers, conveyors, and elevators that are used internally for moving the carrier from one fixed location to another."),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 45 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E87-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1999, 2005 14 10.4 Carrier Location Naming10.4.1 Carrier locations shall be assigned a unique name. Information about the carrier location can be ob-tained byquerying the CarrierObject for the LocationID or by asking the equipment for the CarrierLocation-Matrix. The textform of the LocationID shall be descriptive of the location. For example, LocationID form for load port load/unloadlocation might be LPn, where n equal is equal to the load port number (the load port number is determinedthrough the numbering rule in 9.1). The LocationID form for the FIMS port location might be FIMSn. TheLocationID form for a buffer location might be BUFn.10.5 Load Port Carrier Locations10.5.1 For fixed buffer equipment configured to handle FOUPs, a Load Port has two different Carrier Locations.One represents the place where a Carrier is delivered and picked up, while the other represents the place where theCarrier is docked and can be opened.10.6 Carriers Between Locations10.6.1 When the carrier is traveling from one location to another, the location attribute remains equal to the sourcelocation until the carrier movement is complete and the carrier is resting at the new carrier location (the destinationlocation).10.6.2 Usage10.6.2.1 The Usage parameter indicates the type of substrate the carrier contains. All Usage values are equipmentspecific values. Some internal buffer equipment manages carriers by establishing logical partitions. This type ofequipment shall use the Usage parameter to determine which logical partition where the carrier is held.10.6.3 SubstrateCount10.6.3.1 The SubstrateCount parameter can be sent to the equipment by the host in either the Bind service or theProceedWithCarrier service. However the equipment shall update this parameter based on the results of the read slotmap operation. Furthermore, the equipment shall update the parameter based on its own actions of adding andremoving a substrate to and from a carrier. If the equipment does not know the value of SubstrateCount prior toinstantiation, the equipment shall instantiate the carrier object with the value of null for SubstrateCount.10.6.4 Lot information for ContentMap10.6.4.1 Lot is defined in SEMI E90 as a group of one or more substrates of the same type. It is organized externalto the equipment. The Lot ID is the identifier of this group. If the equipment is informed of the Lot ID to which asubstrate belongs, the equipment must maintain this information.10.6.5 Carrier Accessing Status10.6.5.1 The CarrierAccessingStatus is used by the host to know whether or not the carrier owned by the equipmentcan be moved out. If the carrier is within the internal buffer equipment, this status may be used by the host to issueCarrierOut service.10.7 Carrier State Model10.7.1 The purpose of the Carrier State Model is to define the hosts view of a carrier.

This represents a transient random failure rather than a steadycondition.10.7.7 Bypass Read ID  A carrier ID reader may be unavailable: either out of service, not installed, or otherwisemalfunctioning and unable to execute a read operation. This represents a steady condition that often is known inadvance. The equipment shall provide a user-configurable variable BypassReadID used to bypass verification of thecarrier ID when the carrier ID reader is unavailable or not installed and the loadport is ASSOCIATED.BypassReadID is not used to bypass the carrier ID reader. In this case, the carrier object is instantiated in the IDNOT READ state, and when the carrier is received, the state model transitions to either WAITING FOR HOST orID VERIFICATION OK, depending upon whether BypassReadID is FALSE (the default value) or TRUE. WhenTRUE, then the Carrier ID received in the Bind is used automatically. Otherwise, the carrier transitions toWAITING FOR HOST and waits for the host to send a ProceedWithCarrier. The ID used will be the ID includedwith the ProceedWithCarrier. 11 Access Mode11.1 Access Mode State Model11.1.1 The Access Mode State Model defines the host view of equipment access mode, as well as the hostinteractions with the equipment necessary to switch the access mode. Each Load Port has its own Access Mode StateModel. There are two access mode states: MANUAL and AUTO. These are defined in 11.3.3.11.1.2 The access mode for a load port may be switched at anytime by the host or the operator, except when theLoad Port Reservation State Model for that Load Port is in the RESERVED state or during carrier transfer. Carriertransfer boundaries, for determining when access mode may be changed, are designated by Table 8, Carrier TransferBoundaries.")))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
