The  test  is  not  a  valid  method  for\ncomparing   the   moldability   of   different   compounds\nsince a spiral flow test cannot duplicate actual molding\nconditions in different types of molds.\n3. 2     The    moldability    of    thermosetti ng    molding\ncompounds  has  generally  been  defined  by  a  single\nspiral  flow  number.  The  ram  follower  device  follows\ngraphically  the  molding  compound  as  it  melts  and  the\nrate  of  flow  increases,  as  viscosity  builds  up  due  to\nresin  polymerization,  and  as  the  flow  of  the  compound\nceases.  Thus,  it  measures  the  gelation  point  of  the\ncompound,  or  the  point  where  the  material  ceases  to\nflow.  This  information  can  be  an  aid  in  characterizing\nthe rheological behavior of the molding compound.\n4  Apparatus\n4. 1   Transfer  Molding  Press  \u2014  Wi th  a  platen  area\nsufficient  to  maintain  a  uniform  mold  temperature  and\nhaving  (1)  a  transfer  piston  pressure  potential  of  1000\npsi  on  the  material;  (2)  sufficient  clamping  pressure  to\nprevent  flashing  of  the  molding  compound;  and  (3)  a\nminimum  plunger  speed  of  25.4  mm  (1  inch)  per\nsecond without load.
