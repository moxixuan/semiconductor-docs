Argon,  due  to  its  effectiveness  and  material\ncompatibility, is the most commonly selected shielding\nand   purging   gas.   Argon   and   helium   are   inert   and\ntherefore have no effect on the weld metal. These gases\ndo  have  very  different  ionization  potentials,  thermal\nconductivity, and reactivity.\n9. 5    Argon/hydrogen  mix  is  a  reducing  gas  that  avoids\nthe  formation  of  oxides.  It  also  reduces  the  amperage\nrequired for a given ID weld bead width while reducing\nthe  OD  bead  width.  Argon/hydrogen  mixes  adversely\naffect high ferrite materials (above 80% ferrite). Use of\nargon/hydrogen  mixes  will  shorten  tungsten  electrode\nlife. The weld parameters will be affected by hydrogen\nto  argon  percentages.  Hydrogen  mixes  above  5  vol%\nare not recommended for safety reasons.\n9. 6    Nitrogen  will  cause  instability  of  the  arc  in  mixes\nabove  3  vol%  in  the  shield  (OD)  purge  gas.  It  is  a\nacceptable backing (ID) gas for austenitic stainless and\nmany   CRAs.   Nitrogen   when   exposed   to   welding\ntemperatures  will  cause  nitride  formation  in  some  high\nferrite  materials  (above  80%  ferrite).  Use  of  nitrogen\nmixes   in   the   shielding   (OD)   gas   will   shorten   the\ntungsten electrode life.\n9. 7  The ID purge gas will be certified to 99.9997%, or\nless  than  3  ppm  total  contaminants  (moisture,  oxygen,\nand other contaminants).\n10  Safety Precautions\n10. 1  This practice does not purport to address all of the\nsafety   issues   associated   with   its   use.

It  has  been  derived  from  the  cited\ndocuments. Determination of the suitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user.\nA1-1     General\nA1-1.1   The  fume  generated  when  welding  stainless\nsteels  includes  respirable  particles,  the  composition  of\nwhich\xf3particularly   with   the   flux-shielded   welding\nprocesses\xf3suggests  a  risk  to  cause  cancers.  However,\nepidemiological analyses have not identified any actual\nrisk  specific  to  stainless  steels  but  have  shown  a  slight\nexcess  of  lung  cancers  among  welders  as  a  whole,  i.e.\nboth   welders   of   non-alloyed   steels   and   welders   of\nstainless  steels,  compared  with  the  general  population.\nThe cause of this excess has not been identified but may\nbe   connected   with   factors   incidental   to   welding.\nNevertheless, appropriate precautions to avoid exposure\nto  welding  fume  of  all  kinds  are  advisable  and  indeed\nnecessary if regulatory limits are to be observed.\nA1-1.2    There  is  an  important  difference  between  the\nchemical  forms  of  chromium  in  fume  from  the  flux\nprocesses  and  from  the  gas-shielded  processes.  In  the\nformer   group   most   of   the   chromium   is   present   in\nhexavalent    form    (chromates),    while    almost    all\nchromium   in   fume   produced   by   the   gas-shielded\nprocesses   is   in   the   trivalent   form   and   hexavalent\ncompounds  are  only  present  in  very  small  proportions.\nThe   relevance   of   this   difference   is   that,   without\nreference to welding, hexavalent chromium compounds\nare  classified  as  carcinogenic  to  humans  (Group  1)  by\nthe  IARC\n5\nparticularly  lung  cancer.  This  fear  is  based\non  the  chemical  composition  of  the  fume,  especially\nthat produced by the flux processes, and the very small\nsize  of  the  particles,  which  puts  them  in  the  respirable\nrange,  i.e.,  capable  of  penetration  down  to  the  level  of\nthe  lung  alveoli.  Trivalent  chromium  compounds  are\nunclassifiable  to  carcinogenicity  to  humans  (Group  3).\nNickel compounds are also classified in Group 1 by the\nIARC.\nA1-1.3    Further  information  on  the  above  topic  can  be\nfound  in  Status  Report:  Stainless  Steel  and  Welding\nFume,   SR-0008,   March   2001,   Nickel   Development\nInstitute,  214  King  Street  West,  Suite  510,  Toronto,\nOntario, Canada M5H 3S6.\nA1-1.4   For  information  about  hexavalent  chromium,\nrefer   to   HESIS   Hazard   Alert,   June   1992,   Hazard\nEvaluation  System  &  Information  Service,  California\nOccupational  Health  Program,  2151  Berkeley  Way,\nAnnex 11, Third Floor, Berkeley, CA 94704."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"5 International Agency for Research on Cancer\nNOTICE: SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or\nrepresentations  as  to  the  suitability  of  the  standards  set\nforth    herein    for    any    particular    application.

In laboratory\ntesting  (10)  no  reaction  of  the  silicon  was  noted  with\n50% aqueous HBr after 45 days immersion.\n6. 7.2    One  reason  for  the  lack  of  reactivity  of  silicon\nwith  chlorine,  bromine  or  iodine  halides  is  the  low\nvapor  pressure  of  the  reaction  product.

Typical  stainless  steel  passivity  is  strongly\ndependent  upon  the  amount  of  H\n2\nO  present,  declining\nsharply  as  water  content  increases  above  1  ppm  in  the\npresence  of  halogens  or  halides  (6,  9,  10,  72).    Paciej\n(72)  reported  that  0.1  ppm  moisture  in  HCl  does  not\nattack  316L  stainless,  while  200  ppm  moisture  in  HCl\ncan  significantly  corrode  the  surface  of  this  material.\nFine (9) points out similar behavior for 316L in HBr at\n0. 5  ppm  and  100  ppm  moisture  over  the  course  of  10\ndays.\n6. 7.4    However,  silicon  corrosion  resistance  is  virtually\nunaffected  by  moisture  content  up  to  and  including\naqueous   solutions.
