SPECIFICATION FOR SENSOR/ACTUATOR NETWORK
COMMUNICATIONS FOR LONWORKS
This  standard  was  technically  approved  by  the  global  Information  &amp;  Control  Committee.    This  edition  was
approved for publication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on April 7, 2005.  It was available
at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005.
NOTICE:  This document replaced SEMI E54.6 in 2005.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  This standard specification defines a communication specification based on the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 Control
Networking  Protocol  (L
ONWORKS)  to  enable  communications  between  intelligent  devices  on  a  sensor/actuator
network  (SAN)  that  operate  in  accordance  with  SEMI-specified  device  models  (common  and  device  specific)  on
semiconductor manufacturing equipment.</li><li>2  This document specifies a mapping of the SEMI Common Device Model (CDM) onto L
ONWORKS technology
using  the  L
ONMARK  Interoperability  Guidelines  established  for  LONWORKS  devices.  The  LONMARK  International
Association  will  review  and  approve  the  enhanced  SEMI  L
ONMARK  functional  profiles  presented  in  this  network
communication   document   and   incorporate   the   required   SEMI   profiles   into   the   L
ONMARK   Interoperability
Guidelines.</li><li>3  Background  and  Motivation —  The  L
ONWORKS  communications  system  provides  interconnection  of  smart
control  devices  such  as  sensors,  actuators,  and  controllers  in  a  fast-response  time,  low-cost  network  for  industrial
use. L
ONWORKS enables multiple devices to share a single network, thereby significantly reducing the point-to-point
wiring  between  controllers,  sensors,  and  actuators.  The  L
ONWORKS  network  communications  standard  (NCS)  is
based  on  the  seven-layer  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1  (L
ONWORKS)  protocol,  implemented  by  the  Neuron  Chip,  a
physical  layer  transceiver,  and  an  optional  host  processor.  The  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1  (L
ONWORKS)  control
networking  protocol  was  developed  by  Echelon  and  may  be  freely  licensed  for  implementation  on  any  hardware
platform.  The  SEMI  NCS  for  L
ONWORKS  is  based  on  the  LONMARK  interoperability  guidelines,  which  provide  a
framework for interoperable use of the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L
ONWORKS) protocol at layers 1-6, as well as at the
application layer. Where the L
ONMARK interoperability guidelines do not provide the functionality required by the
SEMI  Common  Device  Model  (CDM)  and  the  SEMI  Specific  Device  models  (SDM),  the  guidelines  are  extended
with SEMI-specific enhanced profile requirements.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This  document  specifies  a  SAN  communications  specification  standard,  based  on  the  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1
Control Networking Protocol (L
ONWORKS) specification, that enables communication with SAN devices configured
according  to  the  SEMI  SAN  Common  Device  Model  and  appropriate  SEMI  SAN  Specific  Device  Model  (SDM)
specifications.</li><li>2  This document specifies the use of L
ONWORKS technology for services that compliant intelligent devices must
support in order to exchange information over this semiconductor equipment sensor/actuator network.</li><li>3  This document specifies the utilization of L
ONWORKS technology to present externally visible device structure
and behavior, specified in the CDM and appropriate SDMs, on a L
ONWORKS network.</li><li>4  This  document  is  used  in  conjunction  with  the  SEMI  SAN  Common  Device  Model  specification  and  one  or
more  SEMI  SAN  Specific  Device  Model  specifications  (e.g.,  for  a  mass  flow  controller).  Together,  the  model
documents describe the externally visible data structures and behavior of devices using L
ONWORKS technology in a
SEMI-compliant SAN system.</li><li>5  This  specification,  together  with  the  sensor/actuator  network  common  device  model,  one  or  more  sensor/
actuator network specific device model documents, the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L
ONWORKS) protocol specification,
and  the  L
ONMARK  interoperability  guidelines,  specifies  requirements  for  SEMI  SAN  implementations  based  on
L
ONWORKS technology.</li></ol><p>SEMI E54.16-0705 © SEMI 2005 2
NOTICE:  This  standard  specification  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.  It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  specification  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  This  document  specifies  a  semiconductor  equipment  SAN  based  solely  on  L
ONWORKS  technology  and  is  a
companion document to the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L
ONWORKS) control networking protocol specification; thus, a
complete  specification  of  this  standard  necessarily  includes  the  L
ONWORKS  specifications.  There  are  other
semiconductor equipment SAN communications options. The specifications for these options are not included here.
3. 2  This  document  specifies  enhancements  that  provide  additional  capabilities  over  and  above  those  currently
required  by  the  L
ONMARK  Interoperability  Guidelines.  In  order  to  avoid  document  consistency  problems,
information in the L
ONWORKS technology specifications that relate to this standard is not repeated in this document.
This  document  is  limited  to  describing  enhancements  or  limitations  of  L
ONWORKS  technology  and  the  LONMARK
interoperability guidelines that are imposed by this specification.
3. 3  A  complete  specification  of  the  conformance  testing  procedure  shall  include  the  applicable  L
ONMARK
interoperability   conformance   testing   specification.   Conformance   testing   shall   include   enhancements   to   the
L
ONMARK interoperability guidelines required by this standard specification.

configuration properties (CP). Input and output network variables and configuration properties may be read and/or
written by the device itself, and all attributes may be polled over the network. Additionally, input network variables
and configuration properties may be updated over the network, and the receipt of such an update may cause an event
to be propagated to the device&#x27;s application layer. This corresponds to a RW (Read and Write) attribute of the object
owning the network variable. Output network variables may not be updated over the network. This corresponds to a
RO (Read Only) attribute of the object owning the network variable. When the device itself updates one of its output
network  variables,  the  value  of  that  variable  may  be  propagated  over  the  network  to  destination  addresses
determined  at  installation  time.  Finally,  configuration  properties  are  attributes  typically  stored  in  non-volatile
memory and preserved across device resets and power cycles.</li><li>4.2  behavior —  Generic  object  behavior  is  specified  by  the  L

Guidelines. Additional object-specific behavior is specified by means of functional profiles.</li><li>4.3  device —  A  device  (or  node)  typically  consists  of  one  network  transceiver  which  implements  the  physical
layer  of  the  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1  (L
ONWORKS)  protocol,  one  Neuron  Chip  with  associated  firmware  which
implements  the  other  layers  of  the  L
ONTALK  protocol,  and  input/output  hardware  implementing  the  physical
interface of the device to external sensor and/or actuator hardware. A L
ONWORKS device may optionally contain a
host processor and associated software or firmware which implements the application layer of the ANSI/EIA/CEA-</li><li>1 (L
ONWORKS) protocol.</li><li>4.4  device model — The device model comprises several elements which fully describe the external interface of
the  device  for  an  interoperable  network.  The  interface  is  made  of  the  following  pieces:  a  Device  Manager  (DM)
object;  a  Sensor/Actuator/Controller  (SAC)  object;  functional  blocks  such  as  sensors,  actuators,  and  controllers;
individual network variables; and configuration properties.</li><li>4.5  instance —  Real  devices  may  have  zero  or  more  instances  of  each  of  the  defined  functional  blocks.  Object
instances are identified by means of an instance number within the device.</li><li>4.6  object —  Functional  blocks  defined  as  a  set  of  one  or  more  network  variable  inputs  and/or  outputs,
implemented as Standard Network Variable Types, and a set of configuration properties, implemented as Standard
Configuration  Property  Types.  Functional  blocks  form  the  basis  of  interoperability  at  the  application  layer.  The
functional blocks describe standard formats for how information is input to, and output from, a device, and shared
with other devices on the network.</li><li>4.7  service — Request services are represented by ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1input network variables (NVI) being  set
and  delivered  to  the  device  application.  Notification  services  are  represented  by  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1output
network variables being set by the device application and delivered over the network.</li></ol><p>SEMI E54.16-0705 © SEMI 2005 5
5. 4.8  state diagram — In a LONWORKS device, state is represented by the collection of values of local and network
variables of the application program. Transitions between states are the result of external events (such as the receipt
of a network variable update, or other I/O event), or internal events (such as the expiration of a timer).
5. 5  L
ONWORKS-Specific  Definitions —  In  addition  to  the  standard  data  type  definitions  for  bit,  nibble,  byte,  and
character, the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L
ONWORKS) protocol defines a set of standard data representations for use as
attribute values.
5. 5.1  binding —  Network  variables  on  the  same  or  different  devices  may  be  associated  together  by  means  of  a
network management service known as binding. Binding is permitted only if all the network variables in the set are
of the same data type. The values of network variables that are bound together are propagated over the network by
the  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1  (L
ONWORKS) protocol.  Table  2  shows  the  permitted  combinations  for  updating  and
polling of network variables.

non-volatile memory.</li><li>5.3  device  interface —  A  device  interface  is  a  specification  of  one  or  more  functional  blocks,  together  with
semantic definitions relating the behavior of the functional block(s) to the network variable values. The collection of

Layered View of the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L
ONWORKS) Protocol</p><ol start="6"><li>1.1  Figure  1  represents  a  conceptual  view  of  the  device  architecture.  Implementations  typically  use  the  Neuron
Chip and its associated firmware, which provide a conforming implementation of layers 2 through 6. The LonMark
Interoperability Guidelines specify the protocol options to be used, most specifically at the physical layer (network
transceivers) and at the application layer (object model).</li><li>2  Physical Layer — The device shall employ one of the L
ONMARK-approved physical channels as specified in the
L
ONMARK  Layers  1–6  Interoperability  Guidelines.  LONWORKS-based  SEMI  SAN-compliant  devices  shall  use,  by
default,  a  two-pin  screw-terminal  open  pluggable  connector  (Weidmüller-Klippon  SL2,  Phoenix  Combicon,  or
equivalent)  for  the  network  connection.  The  default  connector  specification  may  be  overridden  for  specific  device
types  if  special  requirements  apply;  any  such  overrides  shall  be  noted  in  §9,  Specific  Device  Type  Information,  of
this  document.  This  connection  is  polarity-insensitive.  The  requirements  of  semiconductor  equipment  may  be  met
by one of the twisted pair channel specifications listed below.</li><li>2.1  TP/XF-1250 Twisted Pair — This twisted-pair channel operates at a bit rate of 1,250kbps and supports a bus
topology using transformer-coupled transceivers.</li><li>2.2  TP/FT-10  Twisted  Pair —  This  twisted-pair  channel  operates  at  a  bit  rate  of  78kbps  and  supports  both  free
topology and bus topology wiring, as well as optional link power.</li><li>2.3  The L
ONMARK  Layers  1-6  Interoperability  Guidelines  provide  specific  details  of  the  characteristics  of  these
transceivers. This document also provides  specifications  of  wiring  types  and  interconnection  topologies  to  be  used
for  guaranteed  device  interoperability.  Note  that  the  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1  (L
ONWORKS) protocol   supports
heterogeneous  networks.  Devices  with  dissimilar  transceivers  may  be  interconnected  and  communicate  via  routers
or  repeaters.  Similarly,  routers  and  repeaters  may  be  used  to  extend  a  physical  channel  beyond  the  device  count,
wire length, or other physical limitations imposed by the chosen transceiver.</li></ol><p>SEMI E54.16-0705 © SEMI 2005 7
6. 2.4  Multiple  physical  layer  protocols  and  data  encoding  methods  are  used  in  the  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1
(L
ONWORKS) protocol. Differential Manchester encoding is used on twisted pair physical layers.
6. 3  Link  Layer —  The  device  shall  comply  with  the  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1  (L
ONWORKS) protocol  link  layer
specification. This layer includes the media access control sublayer. For a number of reasons, including simplicity
and  compatibility  with  the  multicast  protocol,  the  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1  (L
ONWORKS) protocol  supports  a  simple
connectionless service. Its functions are limited to framing, frame encoding, and error detection.
6. 3.1  Media  Access  Control  Sub-layer —  In  order  to  deal  with  a  variety  of  media  in  the  potential  absence  of
collision  detection,  the  MAC  (Media  Access  Control)  sub-layer  employs  a  collision  avoidance  algorithm  called
Predictive p-persistent CSMA (Carrier Sense, Multiple Access).
6. 4  Network  Layer —  The  device  shall  comply  with  the  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1  (L
ONWORKS) protocol  network
layer specification. This layer handles packet delivery within a single domain, with no provisions for inter-domain
communication. The network service is connection-less, unacknowledged, and supports neither segmentation nor re-
assembly of messages. The routing algorithms employed by the network layer to learn the topology assume a tree-
like network topology; routers with configured tables may operate on topologies with physical loops, as long as the
communication paths are logically tree-like. In this configuration, a packet may never appear more than once at the
router on the side on which the packet originated. The unicast routing algorithm uses learning for minimal overhead
and  no  additional  routing  traffic.  Use  of  configured  routing  tables  is  supported  for  both  unicast  and  multicast
addresses.
6. 5  Transport  Layer —  The  device  shall  comply  with  the  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1  (L
ONWORKS) protocol  transport
layer specification. The heart of the protocol hierarchy is the Transport and Session layers. A common Transaction
Control  sub-layer  handles  transaction  ordering  and  duplicate  detection  for  both  layers.  The  transport  layer  is
connectionless and provides reliable message delivery to both single and multiple destinations. Authentication of the
message sender’s identity is provided as an optional feature. The authentication server requires only the Transaction
Control sub-layer to accomplish its function. The transport and session layer messages may be authenticated using
all  of  the  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1addressing  modes  other  than  broadcast.  The  transport  layer  supports  end-to-end
acknowledged service and an unacknowledged/ repeated service.
6. 6  Session Layer — The device shall comply with the ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L
ONWORKS) protocol session layer
specification.  This  layer  implements  a  simple  Request-Response  mechanism  for  access  to  remote  servers.  This
mechanism  provides  a  platform  upon  which  application-specific  remote  procedure  calls  can  be  built.  The
ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1  (L
ONWORKS) network  management  protocol,  for  example,  is  dependent  on  the  Request-
Response mechanism in the Session layer, even though it accesses the protocol via the application layer interface.
6. 7  Presentation  Layer —  The  device  shall  comply  with  the  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1  (L
ONWORKS) protocol
presentation layer specification. The Presentation layer and the Application layer taken together form the foundation
of  interoperability  for  L
ONWORKS  devices.  The  application  layer  provides  all  the  usual  services  for  sending  and
receiving  messages,  but  it  also  contains  the  concept  of  network  variables.  The  presentation  layer  provides
information  in  the  Application  Protocol  Data  Unit  (APDU)  header  for  how  the  APDU  is  to  be  interpreted  for
network  variable  updates.  This  application-independent  interpretation  of  the  data  allows  data  to  be  shared  among
devices without prior arrangement. With agreement on which network variables are to be used for sensors, actuators,
etc.,  intelligent  components  from  different  manufacturers  may  work  together  without  prior  knowledge  of  each
other&#x27;s characteristics.
6. 8  Application Layer — At the application layer, interoperability between L
ONWORKS-based devices is facilitated
through the use of functional blocks and Standard Network Variable Types (SNVTs). Functional blocks build upon
network variables and provide a concise application layer interface that incorporates semantic meaning for specific
device functions. Functional blocks not only define which SNVTs to use to convey data, but also provide semantic
meaning about the information being communicated. To aid in the specification of specific device models with well-
defined  functional  behavior,  functional  block  interfaces  and  semantics  are  defined  by  functional  profiles.  The
Application Layer also includes the L
ONWORKS file transfer protocol, which provides segmentation and reassembly
of  arbitrary  length  files  of  data.  This  service  may  be  used  to  get  and  set  object  attributes  that  exceed  the  network
variable size limit of 31 bytes.
6. 8.1  Object Models — The ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1 (L
ONWORKS) protocol provides an object-oriented specification
for  defining  and  addressing  network  variables  and  configuration  properties,  which  are  the  representation  of  object
attributes and events. The device shall comply with the object model specifications defined in §7 of this document.</p><p>SEMI E54.16-0705 © SEMI 2005 8
6. 8.2  Functional Block Structure — The LONMARK Application Layer Interoperability Guidelines define a structure
for functional  profiles.  Each  functional  profile  may  have  a  set  of  mandatory  network  variables,  a  set  of  optional
network  variables,  a  set  of  configuration  properties  (both  mandatory  and  optional),  and  a  manufacturer-defined
section,  which  may  be  used  for  non-interoperable  extensions  to  the  profile.  This  is  illustrated  in  Figure  2.  This
notation is defined in the L
ONMARK Application Layer Interoperability Guidelines.</p><p>NOTE: Diagram notation, the arrow-like symbol used in Figure 2 is defined in the LonMark Application Layer Interoperability
Guidelines.

LonMark Object Structure</p><ol start="6"><li>8.3  The L
ONMARK Application Layer Interoperability Guidelines provide for the definition of Standard Network
Variable Types, Standard Configuration Property Types, and Functional Profiles. In the mapping of the SEMI CDM
to  the  L
ONMARK  object  structure  in  §7,  extensions  to  the  current  SNVT  list  and  LONMARK  Interoperability
Guidelines are marked with an asterisk (*). Functional profile numbers are specified by the guidelines; a device may
consist of one instance of a Node Object type, and one or more instances of other functional profiles.</li><li>9  Network  Management —  The  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1  (L
ONWORKS) protocol  defines  a  complete  network
management  and  diagnostic  protocol  for  L
ONWORKS  devices.  This  protocol  is  a  layer  above  the  Session  layer
(request/response  service)  and  provides  mechanisms  for  application  downloading,  device  address  assignment,
distribution of destination addresses for implicit messaging, router configuration, and device-level diagnostics. The
L
ONMARK Application Layer Interoperability Guidelines define a device management layer for functional blocks.
7  Required and Optional Object Types</li><li>1  The  L
ONMARK  guidelines  do  not  require  any  specific  objects  to  exist  in  a  device  in  order  to  be  a  compliant
L
ONMARK device, except that a Node object functional block is required for devices that contain multiple functional
blocks  (SEMI  compliant  devices  will  typically  have  a  Node  object  functional  block).  New  L
ONMARK  standard
profiles are defined in this standard to identify and describe functional blocks that shall exist in devices that are to be
interoperable and interchangeable on a L
ONMARK SEMI compliant SAN network.</li><li>1.1  L
ONMARK International Association publishes functional profiles for various sensor, actuator, and controller
objects.  A  specific  device  may  be  implemented  using  functional  blocks  based  on  these  profiles.  The  Common
Device  Model  specification  additionally  identifies  two  functional  blocks  (namely  the  Device  Manager  (DM)  and
Sensor  Actuator  Controller  (SAC)  objects)  that  must  exist  in  all  SEMI  compliant  SAN  devices.  The  required
functional profiles for a SEMI compliant SAN device utilizing the network communication specification described
herein necessarily comprise, at minimum, the union of the L
ONMARK functional profile requirements and the CDM
specification requirements.</li><li>1.2  A  list  of  required  and  optional  object  types  is  given  in  Table  3.  Additional  objects  that  are  specified  in  a
particular SDM are given identifiers in that SDM specification. The L
ONMARK specific presentation information for
these identifiers is given in §9 of this document.</li></ol><p>SEMI E54.16-0705 © SEMI 2005 9

7. 1.4  A  device  accepts  a  SNVT_semi_req  request  by  updating  the  nvoSemiStat  and  nvoFileStat  outputs  of  the
Node Object function block.  The nvoSemiStat output is defined by the SNVT_semi_status type as follows:
typedef enum {
struct {
STAT_SUCCESS                  =      0,
STAT_UNSUPPORTED_SERVICE   =  1,
STAT_UNSUPPORTED_ATTRIBUTE  =  2,
STAT_SET_ATTRIBUTE_ERROR   =  3,
STAT_GET_ATTRIBUTE_ERROR   =  4,
STST_CALIBRATION_ERROR     =  5,
STAT_SERVICE_REQUEST_ERROR  =  6,
STAT_DIAGNOSTIC_ERROR        =  7,
} semi_status_t;
typedef struct {
semi_status_t status;
unsigned long selected_file;
struct address {            // Address of the requesting device
unsigned short domain_id<!-- -->[6]<!-- -->;
unsigned short domain_length;
unsigned short subnet;
unsigned short node;
}
} SNVT_semi_status;
7. 1.5  If  the  nvoSemiStat  and  nvoFileStat  outputs  indicate  the  request  was  accepted,  the  requesting  device  then
fetches the requested data by transferring the file with the file index reported by the nvoSemiStat response.
7. 1.6  Object  Attributes —  The  SEMI  GetAttribute  and  SEMI  SetAttribute  service  requests  are  implemented  as
network  variable  fetch,  poll,  and  update  requests  addressed  to  the  network  variable  corresponding  to  the  specified
attribute. This is appropriate when responses greater than 31 bytes are not required. A GetAttribute service request
may  be  addressed  directly  to  any  network  variable  as  a  LonTalk  request  message,  using  the  LonTalk  protocol
network  management  NV  fetch  mechanism.  A  GetAttribute  service  request  may  also  be  addressed  to  an  output
network variable as a LonTalk NV poll message, using the NV selection mechanism. A SetAttribute service request</p><p>SEMI E54.16-0705 © SEMI 2005 11
may  be  addressed  to  an  input  network  variable  as  a  LonTalk  NV  update  message,  using  the  NV  selection
mechanism. The confirmation of a SetAttribute (network variable update) is provided by the acknowledged service
of the LonTalk protocol transport layer.
7. 1.7  Sequence  Numbers —  Each  network  variable  in  a  functional  block  is  identified  by  means  of  a  self-
documentation string stored in the device’s memory. This string contains the functional block index of the functional
block to which this variable belongs, and the Sequence Number of the network variable within its functional block.
For  the  L
ONWORKS  NCS,  this  sequence  number  is  identical  to  the  numerical  sequence  number  specified  by  the
CDM  tag.  As  an  example,  using  the  Device  Manager  object  instance  declared  as  the  second object instance  in  the
device  it  has  an  Instance  Id  of  1.  The  Device  Manager  attribute  Standard  Revision  Level  has  the  tag  DmA2.  The
self-documentation string for this network variable is, therefore, specified as “@1|2.”
7. 1.8  Publish  Service —  The  Publish  notification  service  is  implicit  when  an  output  network  variable  is  updated.
The  device  propagates  the  value  of  the  output  network  variable  (equivalent  to  a  read-only  attribute)  to  any  input
network  variable(s)  to  which  it  may  be  bound.  The  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1  (L
ONWORKS)  protocol  only  supports
propagation  of  output  network  variables.  In  CDM  terminology,  this  means  that  only  read-only  attributes  may  be
published. If a specific device model requires publication of a read/write attribute, an output network variable whose
value mirrors the value of the input (read/write) network variable may be introduced to the object definition.
7. 2  Sensor/Actuator/Controller Object (<em>) — The SEMI CDM SAC object coordinates the functionality of Sensor,
Actuator, and Controller objects in the device. The SAC object is mapped to the L
ONMARK Node object functional
block.    Each  device  must  support  one  (and  only  one)  Node  object  functional  block.  The  SAC  functional  block  as
well as its common required and optional attributes, services and behavior are described in document SEMI E54.1
the CDM standard specification. Extensions to the current SNVT list and L
ONMARK Interoperability Guidelines are
marked with an asterisk (</em>).
7. 2.1  Extensions  to  the  Node  Object  functional  profile  are  defined  in  the  L
ONMARK  Interoperability  Guidelines,
which  form  part  of  the  L
ONMARK  Functional  Profiles  for  SEMI  SAN-compliant  devices  based  on  LONWORKS
technology.  Table  4  summarizes  the  network  variables  that  implement  the  attributes  of  the  SAC  object.  Table  5
summarizes the services implemented by the SAC object.

7. 3.4  Device  Manager  Object  Configuration  Properties —  The  DM  object  has  configuration  properties  to  control
exception reporting as shown in Table 8. These parameters are Standard Configuration Property Types (SCPTs).
7. 3.4.1  The  type  SCPT_rept_mode(<em>)  contains  two  four-bit  fields  specifying  the  reporting  method  for  alarms  and
warning conditions. For example, in Neuron C, the application programming language used on the Neuron Chip, the
declaration of SCPT_rept_mode is as follows:
typedef enum {
REP_REQUEST                 = 0,
REP_REQ_LATCHED             = 1,
REP_EVT_TRIGD_ON            = 2,
REP_EVT_TRIGD_ONOFF         = 3,
REP_TIME_TRIGD              = 4,
REP_EVT_ON_TIME_TRIGD       = 5,
REP_EVT_ONOFF_TIME_TRIGD    = 6,
}  rept_mode_t;
typedef struct {
rept_mode_t alarm_rept_mode :4;
rept_mode_t warn_rept_mode  :4;
}  SCPT_rept_mode;
7. 3.4.2  The  type  SCPT_exc_sts(</em>)  is  a  16-bit  value  representing  times  from  0.00  to  655.35  seconds,  with  a
resolution of 0.01 seconds. This parameter is optional. The default reporting mode is REP_REQUEST.
7. 3.4.3  Device  Manager  Functional  Block  Output  Network  Variables  —  The  Device  Manager  functional  block  of
the CDM defines the attribute variable Device Status. The data type SNVT_dev_status is an enumeration.  One field
of  the  union  is  an  enumeration,  corresponding  to  the  device  status  attribute  defined  by  the  table  Device  Status
Attribute Values of the CDM. The values of this type are defined in Table 8.

7. 3.4.4.1  The  value  DS_ABORT_1  corresponds  to  the  Abort  from  Idle  or  Executing  state,  and  the  value
DS_ABORT_2 corresponds to the Abort from Initialized/Self Testing or Self Test Exception state of the DM object.
7. 3.4.5  The type SNVT_exc_que(<em>) contains four fields specifying the exception queue and exception elements to
retrieve. For example, in Neuron C, the application programming language used on the Neuron Chip, the declaration
of SNVT_exc_que_mode is as follows:
typedef enum {
REP_ALARM          = 0,
REP_WARNING        = 1,
}  que_t;
typedef struct {
que_t exception_type :1;
int element_number   :1;
SNVT_state  exception_list<!-- -->[13]<!-- -->;
int exception_clear  :1;
}  SNVT_exc_que;
7. 3.4.6  The  type  SNVT_exc_detail(</em>)  is  a  sequence  of  three  structures  containing  arrays.  The  ANSI/EIA/CEA-
709. 1 protocol limits the size of each of these arrays to 9 bytes, so that the type fits within the network variable size
limit of 31 bytes. For example, in Neuron C, the declaration of SNVT_exc_detail is as follows:
typedef struct {

7. 4  Sensor,  Actuator,  and  Controller  Functional  Blocks —  These  functional  blocks  are  necessarily  specific  to  the
Specific  Device  Models.  The  L
ONMARK  Application  Layer  Interoperability  Guidelines  provide  a  framework  for
defining functional profiles. Specific Device Models may employ these functional profiles, and/or may define their
own  functional  profiles  and  Standard  Network  Variable  Types  for  device-specific  requirements.  As  long  as  the
functional   profile   definition   guidelines   are   followed,   these   profiles   may   be   proposed   to   the   L

This is not an NV or CP.  It is configuration information contained within the device’s NV configuration table and address table that specifies
a  network  variable  connection  between  two  or  more  network  variables  on  the  device.    It  can  only  be  used  to  connect  network  variables  of  the
same type.  The link is created as soon as the tables are updated, so the Commit operation is not a separate step.</p><p>Table 12  Local Link Object Network Services

this service may be used to verify compliance with the SEMI guidelines.</li><li>2  The   certification   procedure   and   checklist   may   be   viewed   and   obtained   by   accessing   web   site

9  Specific Device Type Information
9. 1  This  section  provides  for  the  mapping  of  network-visible  specific  device  model  structure  and  behavior,
specified  in  a  SEMI  standard  Specific  Device  Model  specification,  to  the  ANSI/EIA/CEA-709.1  (L
ONWORKS)
protocol.  Each  subsection  is  devoted  to  a  single  Specific  Device  Model  specification.  As  additional  SEMI  SDM
specifications  are  created,  additional  SDM  mappings  are  added  as  subsections  to  this  NCS  specification.  Unless
otherwise  noted,  all  attributes  and  services  described  are  instance  level  attributes  (as  opposed  to  class  level
attributes).  Device-type-specific  items,  such  as  overrides  to  the  standard  connector,  may  also  be  noted  in  these
subsections.
9. 1.1  Note that the formats of object instance attributes and services are detailed in the associated Specific Device
Model specification. The presentation of the attributes and services to a L
ONWORKS network is detailed in the tables
contained  in  the  following  sub-sections  and  in  the  L
ONMARK  Application  Layer  Interoperability  Guidelines
document. Note that relationships between object classes, including inheritance are defined in the associated SDM
specification and the CDM specification.
9. 1.2  The instance identifier format of 1 through n, assigned to an object type, refers to the possibility of multiple
instantiations of the object type. Refer to Table 3 of this document and the CDM document for a further explanation
of object instance assignments.
9. 2  Specific Device Model For Mass Flow Device — These sections detail the network mapping required to support
the  Specific  Device  Model  For  Mass  Flow  Device  (see  reference  SEMI  E54.3  of  §4.1).  Table  29  summarizes  the
Mass  Flow  Device  object  types.  Subsequent  Table  30  to  Table  49  detail  the  instance  attributes  and  services
associated with each Mass Flow Device object type.
