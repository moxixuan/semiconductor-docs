The  interface  must  address  the\nproper  container  orientation  for  material  transfer  and\nmaintain    continuity    between    the    container    and\nequipment  environment  in  order  to  control  particulate\nand non-particulate contamination.\n2  Scope\nThis  specification  describes  an  approach  to  interfacing\na    clean    transport    container    (pod)    to    a    clean\nenvironmental  housing  on  a  piece  of  semiconductor\nprocessing  equipment  or  to  other  clean  environments.\nThe  system  concept  involves  mating  a  pod  door  to  a\nport door in an equipment interface and transferring the\nwafers into, and out of, the equipment without exposing\nthe wafers to outside contamination.\nThe    incorporation    of    this    standard    may    require\nequipment  designers  to  include  the  features  of  the\ninterface   into   the   tool   design.   Spacing   between\nequipment  interface  ports  must  be  considered  when\nincorporating  this  interface.  Designers  are  directed  to\nthe  recommendations  made  in  SEMI  E15.1  in  this\nregard.\nThis  standard  is  specific  to  the  size  of  the  designated\nwafer  and  references  the  appropriate  Semiconductor\nEquipment and Materials International (SEMI) cassette\nand   wafer   diameter.

A   standby   power   supply   (SPS)   or\nuninterruptible   power   supply   (UPS)   is   included   to\nmaintain EMO and selected cluster tool functions in the\nevent  of  main  power  failure.  It  may  be  desirable  to\ninclude  additional  circuit  breakers  in  the  main  power\nenclosure  if  individual  module  disconnects  are  needed\nat  level  I  in  Figure  R1-1.  Disconnect  at  level  II  in\nFigure  R1-1  is  made  possible  by  the  module  circuit\nbreakers;       SEMI       E7,       \u201cElectrical       Interfaces\nSpecification,\u201d  should  be  used  for  loads  up  to  10  kW.\nAdditional  main  power  enclosures  could  be  provided\nfor  modules  with  heavy  AC  loads,  provided  that  each\nmain   contactor   is   operated   by   one   common   EMO\ncircuit, however, some user\u2019s safety codes may demand\na single source of supply.\nR1-2  Operation of Remote Equipment\nR1-2.1    Activation  of  the  EMO  shall  stop,  by  fail-safe\nmeans at the tool, the delivery of potentially hazardous\nenergy  (e.g.,  high  voltage,  laser)  or  hazardous  material\n(e.g., toxic process gas, coolant) to the cluster tool (see\nSection 6.1.3).\nR1-3  EMO Switch Placement\nR1-3.1    The   EMO   switches   on   each   module   (see\nSection  6.2.1)  need  to  be  placed  so  that  they  are\naccessible  to  any  person  in  the  vicinity  of  the  cluster\ntool. Local safety codes may take precedence in matters\nof  EMO  switch  placement.  The  standard  ensures  that\neach  module  has  at  least  one  EMO  switch  and  that  its\noperation, when the module is attached, removes power\nfrom the entire cluster tool.\nR1-4  EMO Bypass\nR1-4.1 Implementation  \u2014  The  functions,  specified  in\nSection  4.2.1,  to  allow  EMO  bypass  and  to  ensure  that\nmodule  power  is  off  when  the  EMO  is  removed  from\nthe  cluster  tool  EMO  circuit,  can  be  implemented  as\nshown  in  Figure  R1-2.  A  relay  or  switch,  operated  in\nparallel  with  the  dedicated  circuit  breaker  specified  in\nSection  6.1.2  for  the  module,  provides  24  VAC  to  the\ncoil  of  a  double  pole  relay  when  the  circuit  breaker  is\nde-energized. An indicator light in parallel with the coil\nilluminates  when  the  bypass  is  enabled  and  the  power\nto the module is off. One set of contacts of this relay is\nused to enable the momentary EMO bypass switch. The\nother  set  is  connected  across  pins  3  and  4  of  the  EMO\nreceptacle  at  the  EMO  interface  and  is  in  the  EMO\ncircuit  when  the  EMO  bypass  jumper  plug  is  installed.\nBoth sets of contacts are wired to open when voltage is\nremoved  from  the  relay  coil,  i.e.,  when  the  circuit\nbreaker is closed.\nR1-4.2 Module  Disconnect  \u2014  The  dedicated  circuit\nbreaker  (see  Section  6.2.1)  to  the  module  must  be\nturned  off  prior  to  disconnect.  This  causes  the  contacts\nin  series  with  the  momentary  EMO  bypass  switch  to\nclose,  rendering  it  operational.  At  this  point,  the  EMO\nswitch  on  the  module  is  still  in  the  cluster  tool  EMO\ncircuit.  To  disconnect,  the  operator  holds  in  the  EMO\nbypass  switch  while  removing  the  module  EMO  plug\nfrom  the  EMO  interface  and  then  connecting  the  EMO\nbypass jumper plug. The momentary bypass switch can\nthen be released.\nR1-4.3 Module  Connect  \u2014  To  connect  a  module,  the\ndedicated circuit breaker (see Section 6.2.1) must be off\nat  the  power  distribution  point  to  the  module.  The\npower cable may be attached to the module at this time.\nThe  operator  holds  in  the  momentary  bypass  switch\nwhile disconnecting the EMO bypass jumper plug from\nthe  EMO  interface  and  connecting  the  module  EMO\nPlug.   The   momentary   bypass   switch   can   then   be\nreleased. Power cannot be applied to the module unless\nthe EMO is connected (as shown in Figure R1-2).\nR1-5  Additional Documents and References\nIn  implementing  the  standard,  documents  that  may\nprovide additional guidance include:\nR1-5.1  SEMI Document\nSEMI   S2   \u2014   Safety   Guidelines   for   Semiconductor\nManufacturing Equipment\nR1-5.2  Other Documents\nInternational Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)\nStandard 204, Sections 1, 2 and 3.\n(U.S.) National Electrical Code (NEC).\n2"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"2 National Fire Protection Association, Batterymarch, Quincy, MA"),(0,i.yg)("h1",{id:"02269"},"02269"),(0,i.yg)("ol",{start:2269},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"})),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E20-0697 \xa9 SEMI 1991, 2002 4"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Figure R1-1\nExample: AC Distribution/EMO Block Diagram"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E20-0697 \xa9 SEMI 1991, 2002 5"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Figure R1-2\nExample: EMO Connect/Disconnect Circuit(Module Power is \u201coff,\u201d as drawn.)"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"NOTICE: The user\u2019s attention is called to the possibility that compliance with this standard may require use of an\ninvention  covered  by  patent  rights.

The\nsubstantial   clearance   between   the   wafer   and   the\nchamber  wall  is  to  allow  freedom  for  process-specific\ndesign requirements.\nR1-1.2    Individual  process  chamber  designs  may  place\nthe wafer closer to the interface plane than 305 mm (12\nin.) and still conform to the standard.\nR1-1.3      Wafers   are   transported   individually   in   a\nhorizontal  attitude.  Modules  may  contain  any  number\nof wafers. For example, batch processing is allowed.\nR1-2  Vertical Position of Transport Plane\nR1-2.1    The  transport  plane  elevation  of  1100  mm\n(43.307 in.) (see Section 4.1.2) is positioned within the\nconstraints  placed  on  the  cluster  tool  by  the  Inter-\nEquipment    Automation    requirement    for    cassette\nplacement  (SEMI  E15).  SEMI  E15  specifies  the  load\nheight for cassettes to be 900 mm (35.46 in.) \xb1 10 mm\n(0.394 in.) outside an environmental load-lock.\nR1-2.2    The  vertical  position  of  the  transport  plane  is\nderived from the following contributions:\n\u2022 910  mm  (35.854  in.)  is  a  worst-case  cassette  load\nheight position.\n\u2022 12 mm (0.473 in.) is a nominal pickup clearance to\nzero  a  wafer  elevator  indexer  after  the  cassette  is\ndrawn into the environmental load-lock.\n\u2022 178 mm (7.01 in.) is the location of the top slot in a\nstandard 200 mm (8 in.) wafer carrier (SEMI E1.7).\nR1-2.3    These  additive  contributions  assure  that  the\ntransport  plane  elevation  allows   as   much   space   as\npossible  for  location  of  support  equipment  such  as\npumps,   electronics,   and   power   supplies   below   the\nprocess chamber. The 1100 mm (43.307 in.) \u201cnominal\u201d\ndimension  could  be  adjustable  by  the  module(s)  to\nwithin \xb1 25 mm (1 in.).\nR1-3  Vertical Motion\nR1-3.1  The standard (see Section 4.1.2.1) requires that\nthe  transport  module  be  capable  of  moving  in  two\nplanes. An ability to move in other planes is optional.\nR1-3.2    The  transport  module  moves  the  wafer  in  the\nhorizontal  wafer  transport  plane  (see  Definition  3.12).\nThe  transport  module  has  a  vertical  motion  capability\nfor  wafer  handoff  or  pickup.  It  is  assumed  that  the\ntransport  module  moves  in  the  lower  plane  after  wafer\nhandoff or prior to wafer pickup.\nR1-4  Interface Seal Zone\nR1-4.1    The  interface  seal  zone  (see  Section  4.2.1)  is\nsufficiently    wide    to    permit    double    seals    with\nintermediate pumping.\nR1-4.2  Blank-Off Plates \u2014 The location of the seals on\nthe transport module allows plain blank-off plates to be\nused for environmental sealing.\nR1-5  Wafer Transport Zone\nR1-5.1    The  minimum  specified  height  of  32  mm\n(1.184   in.)   (see   Section   4.2.2)   provides   sufficient\nclearance  for  passage  of  a  knuckle  joint  or  pivot  point\nin  the  transport  module  end  effector  (see  SEMI  E22,\n"Cluster Tool Module Interface: Transport Module End\nEffector  Exclusion  Volume  Standard")  and  for  6  mm\n(0.238 in.) of vertical motion. The wafer transport zone\nmay  be  expanded  up  to  the  boundary  of  the  interface\nseal zone when a module requires a larger opening (see\nSection 4.2.1 and Figure 3).\nR1-6  Interface Plane Alignment Pins\nR1-6.1    The  standard  (see  Section  4.2.3)  implies  the\nnormal engineering practice of chamfering pin ends and\ncountersinking  pin  locating  holes.  Actual  dimensions\nfor  this  have  been  specified  or  recommended  by  other\nauthorities.\nR1-6.2    Pins  reside  in  the  sealing  surface  to  avoid\naccidental damage to the surface finish during assembly\nand  disassembly.  With  centrally  placed  pins,  valves\nmay  be  mounted  in  either  orientation  if  this  simplifies\nservicing or accessibility.\nR1-6.3    A  clearance  hole  and  slot  arrangement  allows\nuse of dissimilar flange materials in a dynamic thermal\nenvironment.\nR1-7  Isolation Valves\nR1-7.1    The  standard  (see  Section  4.2.4)  allows  the\nvalves   to   be   integral   to   the   modules   or   discrete\nseparable units.'),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E21-94 \xa9 SEMI 1991, 2002 8\nR1-8  Clamping\nR1-8.1    The  standard  (see  Section  4.3.1)  allows  a\nuniversal   clamping   scheme   to   be   employed.

The standard should be referred to in all cases.\nR1-1  Wafer Transport\nR1-1.1   The standard (see Section 6.1) does not require\nthat  the  entire  transport  module  end  effector  move  in  a\nhorizontal   attitude   while   the   wafer   does   have   this\nrequirement.  For  example,  the  transport  module  end\neffector  may  have  a  component  of  motion  in  a  plane\nother  than  the  horizontal  during  wafer  transport  across\nthe interface plane.\nR1-2  Variables \u2014 Definitions and Dimensions\nR1-2.1   The function of Table 2 (see Section 6.2) is to\nlist   the   numerical   values   for   the   wafer   dependent\nvariables used in Figures 1 and 2. The values are wafer\nsize  dependent  so  as  not  to  penalize  the  design  of  a\ntransport module end effector when handling only small\ndiameter  wafers.  For  example,  the  physical  size  of  a\ntransport  module  end  effector  for  a  100  mm  diameter\nwafer may be smaller than that for a 200 mm diameter\nwafer.\nR1-3  Vertical Plane Exclusion Zone\nR1-3.1   The   development   of   the   numeric   values\nspecified in the standard (see Section 6.5) and given in\nFigure 2 are described below.\nR1-3.2   The  3  mm  height  above  the  wafer  transport\nplane   (defined   in   SEMI   E21)   allows   for   transport\nmodule  end  effectors  which  use  contraints  (e.g.,  a\ncupped  device  or  pins)  to  ensure  the  wafer  does  not\nslide.  Also,  this  may  be  necessary  if  the  wafer  is\ntransported with the circuit side facing down.\nR1-3.3    The  7  mm  value  allows  for  a  4  mm  thickness\nbelow  the  wafer  transport  plane  to  accommodate  a\nstructurally  and  thermally  strong  transport  module  end\neffector design.\nR1-3.4    The  12.5  mm  thickness  allows  for  process  or\ncassette modules with a minimum slot opening value of\nless than 32 mm (see SEMI E21).\nR1-3.5   The  200  mm  minimum  length  part  of  the\nexclusion   zone   allows   for   a   transport   module   end\neffector of limited reach to pass into modules with slot\nopenings smaller than the minimum value of 32 mm.\nR1-3.6    The  23  mm  thickness  allows  for  the  presence\nof  a  \u201cwrist\u201d  joint  or  for  additional  rigidity  in  the\ntransport module end effector.\nR1-3.7   The  120  mm  length  is  specified  as  a  fixed\nnumber   to   ensure   that   multiple   wafer   sizes   (and\ntransport   module   end   effectors)   do   not   necessarily\ndemand  a  change  in  geometry  of  the  receiving  module\naround the wafer transport position.\nR1-3.8   The  minimum  nominal  clearance  above  and\nbelow the exclusion zone is 1.5 mm on both sides of the\ntransport  module  end  effector  when  it  passes  through\nthe  minimum  slot  opening.  This  takes  into  account  the\nexclusion   zone   size   due   to   the   vertical   travel   the\ntransport module end effector may experience.\nR1-3.9    A  subset  of  the  vertical  plane  exclusion  zone\n(see Figure R1-1) is required by a transport module end\neffector  which  must  access  wafers  directly  from  SEMI\nstandard  or  equivalent  cassettes.  The  vertical  plane\nexclusion zone described in the standard (see Figure 2)\nwas  not  subject  to  these  restrictions  since  a  single\ngeneric transport module end effector design was found\nnot to be practical.\nR1-4  Transport Module End Effector Exclusion\nVolume\nR1-4.1   This  volume  as  described  in  Section  6.6  is\nintended  to  be  the  volume  within  which  the  transport\nmodule end effector has complete autonomy. Therefore,\nprocess and cassette modules are not allowed to violate\nthis   volume   during   wafer   transport.

Note  that  some  of  these\nconditions  prevent  opening  and  others  prevent  closing\nof  the  valves.  (See  Section  4.1.).  Module  types  are\ndefined  in  SEMI  E21.  SEMI  S2  provides  guidance  in\ndefining potential safety hazards. It is common practice\nto  detect  valve  positions  and  so  verify  operation,  but\nthis is not an interface matter.\nR1-1.2  Transport  Module  Examples  \u2014  The  transport\nmodule   end   effector   (see   SEMI   E22)   is   extended\nbeyond   the   interface   plane.   The   connected   module\nshould not close its isolation valve, as such an operation\ncould damage the end effector.\nR1-1.2.1    The  transport  module  is  not  at  an  acceptable\ntransfer  pressure.

The transport module should not open its\nisolation valve and attempt to extend its end effector.\nR1-1.3.1    The  process  module  is  not  at  an  acceptable\ntransfer  pressure.  For  instance,  the  module  may  be  at\natmospheric  pressure  for  preventive  maintenance.

In the figure, the contacts\nin  module  B  are  closed,  enabling  operation  of  the\nisolation  valve  controlled  by  module  A,  while  one  of\nthe contacts in module A is open, preventing closure of\nthe isolation valve controlled by module B.\nR1-3  Interlock Example\nR1-3.1    This  example  elucidates  some  of  the  interlock\nlogic  described  in  Section  4.2.  In  the  case  described\nhere,   the   Transport   Module   (TM)   end   effector   is\nextended   into   a   Process   Module   (PM),   which   is\nequipped with an isolation valve. This valve is inhibited\nfrom closing by the interlock in the TM.\nR1-3.2  A situation arises in the PM which results in its\ninterlock  inhibiting  the  opening  of  the  isolation  valve\n(which  is  already  open)  on  the  TM.  As  specified  in\nSection  4.3.3,  the  TM  detects  the  interlock  change  and\nimmediately  withdraws  its  end  effector  from  the  PM.\nThe   TM   interlock   enables   the   closure   of   the   PM\nisolation  valve  (which  the  PM  may  do  if  that  is  the\nappropriate  response  to  the  situation)  and  the  TM  can\nclose its isolation valve."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E24-92 \xa9 SEMI 1992, 2004 4"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Figure R1-1\nIllustration of Isolation Valve Interlock Standard"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"NOTICE:   The   user\u2019s   attention   is   called   to   the\npossibility   that   compliance   with   this   standard   may\nrequire use of an invention covered by patent rights.
