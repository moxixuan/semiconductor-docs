Figure 14Equipment Element 6.4.4.2 The key and keyref constructs in the schema allow the enforcement the structure of the document. A keydefines an element that may be used to uniquely identify a structure in the document. To uniquely identify thestructure in the document, the key element must remain unique within the document. A document will failvalidation if an instance of the element is found that is not unique.6.4.4.3 The keyref construct allows a reference to a specific key to be created. The keyref requires an instance ofthe element exist with the same value as the reference. The key and keyref constructs allow the enforcement of theUid elements in the CEM schema. A key exists for all Uid elements in the document forcing each Uid defined in thedocument to be unique and creates a table of them. This key is then used to enforce references to all objects base onNameable in the document. Additional keys and keyref fields are defined to enforce a reference to an IODevice,Subsystem, or Module.6.4.4.4 The unique construct is also used to enforce the structure of the document. The unique construct defines anelement that must be unique within a portion of the document. For the CEM schema, the unique construct enforcesthe uniqueness of object names within an aggregation.

Originally published March 2003;last published March 2004. 1 Purpose1.1 The inclusion of XML (Extensible Markup Language) notation within current SEMI standards reflects theindustrys growing interest in XML technology. This guide is the first step to prepare for XML protocols in SEMIstandards and to establish consistency in XML style and usage. Recommendations given in this document areintended for the definition and conformance of XML based standards. This document also attempts to highlightthose areas where standardization and further work may be required. 2 Scope2.1 This guide is intended to promote interoperable application of XML in a variety of semiconductormanufacturing usage contexts. It addresses an approach for the usage and definition of XML specifications withinthe semiconductor industry with the focus on the use of XML in future SEMI standards. These guidelines should beapplied to any XML document or schema generated as part of a SEMI standard for communication betweensoftware entities. This guide includes the following:2.1.1 Overview of XML Resources, Organizations, and Standards,2.1.2 XML Three Tier Model Architecture, and2.1.3 General and specific recommendations of XML style and usage.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Because of the rapid development of new standards in the XML arena at the time of the writing of thisdocument, it was found that there are areas in XML where standards are still in the development stage. Someexamples of emerging XML technologies are: XMI (XML Metadata Interchange), SOAP (Simple Object AccessProtocol), and Web Services Routing. Therefore, this guide does not include recommendations in those areas untilthe governing bodies approve these specifications.

These schemas usuallycover a particular area such as equipment, transport system, scheduler/dispatcher, maintenance, etc.7.1.2 Secondary Schemas  Secondary Schemas are schemas that have been defined by SEMI. These schemas arefor a particular functionality required by the application such as carrier management, process job, data collection,etc. Secondary Schemas may derive from Primary Schemas as a base by extension or restriction.7.1.3 Tertiary Schemas  Tertiary Schemas are defined by the supplier of the tool or application. These Schemasmay derive from either Primary or Secondary Schemas as a base by extension or restriction. 8 XML Recommendations8.1 XML Document Compliance8.1.1 All XML documents, by definition, must comply with the W3C Recommendation, XML version 1.0 (see",(0,i.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml"},"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml")," for more detail on the specification). The purpose of this compliance is to assurethat all XML documents are well-formed and valid. A well-formed document means that there is exactly oneroot element, all sub-elements (and recursive sub-elements) have delimiting start- and end-tags, and that they areproperly nested within each other. A well-formed document also conforms to the XML syntax specification anddoes not include external references unless a schema reference is provided. An XML document is valid if it hasan associated schema and complies with the constraints expressed in the schema. Valid XML data is also well-formed.8.2 Use of XML Schema versus DTD8.2.1 All XML documents should conform to a specified set of production rules. These production rules should bespecified as XML Schemas. XML Schemas are the preferable way to define XML documents. XML Schemas aremodular in structure and can be built from multiple components (files) by including or importing the components.8.3 Using Elements versus Attributes8.3.1 When defining attributes from an object model, it is preferable to define them as XML elements such that theycan be easily extended by other applications.8.3.2 Use elements if the information is hierarchical, contains a content model, or could potentially become morecomplex or hierarchical in the future.8.3.3 Use attributes when the information is metadata about the element.8.4 Naming Conventions8.4.1 The following list is a compendium of recommended practices to be used when naming attributes and simpleor complex elements.8.4.1.1 Use the UpperCamelCase convention for elements and the lowerCamelCase convention for attributes.8.4.1.2 Do not use any punctuation in the element name; i.e. underscores, dashes, etc. Use only alphanumericcharacters."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 8 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E121-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2005 4 8.4.1.3 Acronyms should be all in uppercase. Following a Three (or more) Letter Acronym (TLA), all inuppercase, the next letter is lowercase, i.e.: TLAlowercase, not TLAUppercase.8.5 Common XML Structures8.5.1 When defining a list of elements where each has the same element name, nest the list of elements inside aparent element. Form the parents element name by concatenating the name of the list elements with the wordList.8.5.1.1 For example:Substrate1Substrate2:Substrate25 8.6 Schema Element Organization  The following recommendations apply only to the Primary and SecondarySchemas.8.6.1 With the purpose of readability of the schema and to aid in the understanding of the XML document, thefollowing guidelines are recommended when elements are defined in the XML document or schema:8.6.1.1 Elements of type ID or KEY should be listed at the top of the schema, and elements of type IDREF orKEYREF should be listed second.8.6.1.2 Elements of simpleType should be declared first, followed by elements of complexType.8.7 XML Namespaces8.7.1 A namespace name is a URI (Universal Resource Identifier) that uniquely identifies the namespace. Anamespace is a group of names usually with a related purpose and context. The namespace is a globally uniquename. This is ensured by using a domain names as part of the namespace definition or a pre-determined identifier.SEMI documents will use the URN (Universal Resource Naming) convention to define namespaces, suppliers orany other 3 rd party suppliers can use either URN or URL (Universal Resource Locator) descriptions.8.7.2 Each application or document definition is responsible for providing a namespace for the extension of itsvocabulary definition. A namespace must be unique and to ensure its uniqueness the definitions of namespaces mustfollow the rules described below.8.7.3 Namespace Syntax8.7.3.1 SEMI Namespaces use Uniform Resource Names (URNs). All URNs have the following syntax: ::= urn: : 8.7.3.2 Where is the namespace identifier and is the namespace specific string. The syntaxis limited to upper or lower characters followed by upper or lower characters including a hyphen -. ::= ","[","]","*"," ::= | ::= | | | - 8.7.3.3 The namespace identifier is case insensitive thus ABC and abc refer to the same namespace.

For example, Specification for Carrier Management = E087. In those cases where the standardhas not been approved but a formal document number has been assigned, use this number instead. For example,Equipment Diagnostic Interface = Doc3563. When the definition is from a third party use the defined companydomain. For example, Etch equipment = EtchTool or Model-3731-134.8.7.3.7  Properly identifying the revision level of the schema and it is required when there is anapproved version of the standard the namespace definition should include the date that corresponds to the standardrelease date or when it was approved. Dates are represented as month (mm) and year (yy) and use the Vmmyyformat. This field is not required when SEMI standards are non-existent. For third party applications it isrecommended that the Vx-x form be used. For example, 2001 Feb = V0201 or for Version 2.1 = V2-18.7.3.8  This label corresponds to the actual name of the document to which the namespace belongs.For metadata definitions include the descriptive name of the schema using upper camel case. Ex.CarrierManagement, EquipmentDiagnosticAcquisition, EquipmentMetadata, etc. For web services, the includes the service or interface role and whether it corresponds to the binding or the portType definition. (SeeUDDI Version 3 from OASIS for WSDL structure).Examples of valid representations of namespaces are: urn:semi-org:xsd.E087.V0702.CarrierManagementurn:semi-org:xsd.Doc3509.V12.DataCollectionManagementurn:supplierXX-com:EtchTool.V07.Model123urn:semi-org:ws.E132-1.V0305.SessionManager-bindingurn:semi-org:ws.E125-1.V1104.MetadataManager-portType Examples of invalid representation of namespaces are: urn:semi.org:xsd.Doc3509.V12.DataCollectionManagement (Invalid use of period in )urn:semi-org:xsd.E087.V7.22.CarrierManagement (Invalid use of period in ) 8.7.4 Multiple Default Namespaces8.7.4.1 When more than one namespace is used in an XML document or schema, a prefix shall be defined for eachof the namespaces that uniquely identifies the elements that belong to each of the namespaces. This prefix is used tospecify that a local element or attribute name belongs to a particular namespace. These prefixes are used to overrideattribute values and must be documented by the supplier of the application. The following rules apply to prefixes:Rule 1: Prefixes should be defined in all uppercase or all lower case letters but not both. Ex: abcd xyze"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 10 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E121-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2005 6 Rule 2: Do not use the same prefix for more than one XML namespace. Prefixes defined with the same charactersand in the same order are considered the same even when defined in different letter case. Ex. CMS and cms are equivalent. 8.7.5 Target Namespace8.7.5.1 When more than one namespace is used in schema definition a target namespace should be defined using thetargetNamespace format definition. The target namespace definition should include the elementFormDefault =qualified such that the elements defined within the target namespace are all qualified (in the namespace).For example: For web services: 8.8 Character Sets8.8.1 Vocabularies (element and attribute names) should be restricted to the ASCII 7-bit character set (ISO-646) inaddition to restrictions imposed by XML and XML Schema on element and attribute names as defined in thisdocument.8.8.2 XML Schema and instance documents should use the UTF-8 (ISO-10646) encoding; all other documentsshould use the UTF-8 encoding (other encoding types may be used for documents whose intended use is restricted tolocales where the restriction to UTF-8 is inappropriate).8.8.3 UTF-8 supports the ASCII 7-bit character set and the Unicode character set and is the current defaultencoding for SOAP based documents.8.9 Extensions to Enumeration Lists8.9.1 As a general guideline fixed enumeration lists should not to be changed with additional values. Extendableenumeration lists, on the other hand, are defined such that they allow the inclusion of supplier or application specificchoices.8.9.2 Non-extendable Enumeration Lists8.9.2.1 When an element or attribute has a fixed list of values it can be assumed that it is necessary to restrict thelist. The reasons for restriction to a fixed list are: The implementation has a known set of cases to consider. Variations in spelling, abbreviating, and case use need to be eliminated.For example, an answer to a question may be either yes or no. A depth may be either HI or LOW. A unit ofmeasure may be one of a long, but finite list of ISO abbreviations."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 11 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E121-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 20057 8.9.2.2 For this case implementation is straight forward. An enumerated list is the choice and the list is notextendable. The above construct should only be used where it is clear that the list should be tightly controlled andonly extended as a new version. If a user needs to extend the list they should copy this construct and build their ownschema with the simpleType that contains the new set of values. When the usage case indicates that the enumerated list should be fixed then a simpleType using enumeration ofvalues should be used. The elements and attributes that use these values should be local. Extension (or furtherrestrictions) on the set of values should be done by SEMI with a change in version. (block=#all may also be used) 8.9.3 Extendable Fixed Enumerated Lists8.9.3.1 The term extendable fixed is contradictory. However, there is a common usage case suggested for thissituation. This case is where the list is fixed but allows other or unknown to be specified. In this case, there is nosemantic meaning to the value of other or unknown except that it states that the given list has not appropriatevalues.In this example a list of process control may include ","{","R2R, FDC, SPC, other","}",". The instance writer may not want touse the listed options, and therefore can choose other or unknown as the value.8.9.3.2 In this case the semantic meaning of the two values is different. Other generally means that there is anappropriate value but it is not in the list of values that are given. Unknown means that the instance writer does notknow the value. The example below illustrates a list where the enumeration other defined.  When a fixed list may not be inclusive of all possible values, include the value, other. When a fixed list is part of a mandatory element or attribute, consider including the value unknown.8.9.4 General Extendable Enumerated Lists8.9.4.1 In the previous section the value other is described to be an extension policy. While this allows the user tosay that there is a value other than those in the enumerated list that is appropriate, it does not define ahead of timewhat the value is.

R1-1 Overview of XML Resources, Organizations and StandardsR1-1.1 There are an extensive number of resources in the area of XML. Most of the information is readilyavailable from organizations such as OMG, W3C, RosettaNet, ebXML, OASIS, Sun Micro Systems, IBM andothers through their web sites. There has been a lot of work standardizing dictionaries and vocabularies for severalindustries and these documents can be used until further work is generated in this industry. Books are also widelyavailable from several editorial companies like OReily, Wrox, SAMS, Addison Wesley and other to mention some.Titles vary from publisher to publisher but the information is in general the same. Next, is a list of theseorganizations and their role in the development of standards for XML.R1-1.2 OMGR1-1.2.1 The Object Management Group (OMG) is an open membership, not-for-profit consortium that producesand maintains computer industry specifications for interoperable enterprise applications. The membership roster,comprises of about 800 scientists from the industry, includes virtually every large company in the computerindustry, and hundreds of smaller ones. Their flagship specification is the multi-platform Model DrivenArchitecture (MDA), recently underway but already well known in the industry. It is based on the modelingspecifications the MOF, the UML, XMI, and CWM. OMGs own middleware platform is CORBA, which includesthe Interface Definition Language OMG IDL, and protocol IIOP. The Object Management Architecture (OMA)defines standard services that will carry over into MDA work shortly. OMG Task Forces standardize DomainFacilities in industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, telecommunications, and others. This organization is ofinterest because of the work made in the areas of UML, XMI and MOF.

W3C has morethan 500 Member organizations from around the world and has earned international recognition for its contributionsto the growth of the Web. By promoting interoperability and encouraging an open forum for discussion, W3Ccommits to leading the technical evolution of the Web. In just over seven years, W3C has developed more than 35technical specifications for the Webs infrastructure. Some examples of those technical specifications are: The XML1.0 Recommendation (published in February 1998). This was the first step towards the next generation Web,allowing each community to design languages that suit their particular needs and integrate them harmoniously into ageneral infrastructure based on XML. Since XML 1.0, a number of Recommendations have added to the XMLinfrastructure: XML Namespaces was published in January 1999, Associating Style Sheets with XML documentswere published in June 1999, and XSLT, for XML transformations, was published in November 1999.

For example, in the tag , title is an attribute, and My Slide is its value.R1-2.2 Binding  Construction of the code needed to process a well-defined bit of XML data.R1-2.3 Comment  Text in an XML document that is ignored, unless the parser is specifically told to recognize it.A comment is enclosed in a comment tag, like this: .R1-2.4 Content  The part of an XML document that occurs after the prolog, including the root element andeverything it contains.R1-2.5 CDATA  A predefined XML tag for Character DATA that says dont interpret these characters, asopposed to Parsed Character Data (PCDATA), in which the normal rules of XML syntax apply (for example,angle brackets demarcate XML tags, tags define XML elements, etc.). CDATA sections are typically used to showexamples of XML syntax. Like this:..A sample slide.. ","]","]",">","which displays as:..A sample slide.. R1-2.6 Data  The contents of an element generally used when the element does not contain any sub elements.When it does, the more general term content is generally used. When the only text in an XML structure is containedin simple elements, and elements that have sub elements have little or no data mixed in, then that structure is oftenthought of as XML data, as opposed to an XML document.R1-2.7 Declaration  The very first thing in an XML document, which declares it as XML. The minimaldeclaration is . The declaration is part of the document prolog.R1-2.8 Document  In general, an XML structure in which one or more elements contain text intermixed with subelements. See also: data.R1-2.9 DOM  Document Object Model. A tree of objects with interfaces for traversing the tree and writing anXML version of it, as defined by the W3C specification.R1-2.10 Element  A unit of XML data, delimited by tags. An XML element can enclose other elements. Forexample, in the XML structure, ...., the element contains two elements.R1-2.11 Entity  A distinct, individual item that can be included in an XML document by referencing it. Such anentity reference can name an entity as small as a character (for example, ","<"," , which references the less-thansymbol, or left-angle bracket (","<","). An entity reference can also reference an entire document, or external entity, or acollection of element definitions (a parameter entity)."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 17 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E121-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 200513 R1-2.12 Entity Reference  A reference to an entity that is substituted for the reference when the XML documentis parsed. It may reference a predefined entity like ","<"," or it may reference one that is defined in the schema. In theXML data, the reference could be to an entity that is defined in the local subset of the schema or to an external XMLfile (an external entity). The schema can also carve out a segment of schema specifications and give it a name so thatit can be reused (included) at multiple points in the schema by defining a parameter entity.R1-2.13 Error  A SAX parsing error is generally a validation errorin other words, it occurs when an XMLdocument is not valid, although it can also occur if the declaration specifies an XML version that the parser cannothandle. See also: fatal error, warning.R1-2.14 External Entity  An entity that exists as an external XML file, which is included in the XML documentusing an entity reference. R1-2.15 External Subset  That part of the schema that is defined by references to external .dtd or .xsd files.R1-2.16 Fatal Error  A fatal error occurs in the SAX parser when a document is not well formed, or otherwisecannot be processed. See also: error, warning.R1-2.17 General Entity  An entity that is referenced as part of an XML documents content, as distinct from aparameter entity, which is referenced in the schema. A general entity can be a parsed entity or an unparsed entity.R1-2.18 HTML  Hypertext Markup Language. The language of the Web. A system where every document has aglobally unique location, and documents can link to one another.R1-2.19 Local Subset  That part of the schema that is defined within the current XML file.R1-2.20 Namespace  A standard that lets you specify a unique label to the set of element names defined by aschema. A document using that schema can be included in any other document without having a conflict betweenelement names. The elements defined in your schema are then uniquely identified so that, for example, the parsercan tell when an element called should be interpreted according to your schema, rather than using thedefinition for an element called name in a different schema.R1-2.21 Normalization  The process of removing redundancy by modularizing, as with subroutines, and haveremoving superfluous differences by reducing them to a common denominator. For example, reducing them to asingle NL normalizes line endings from different systems, and multiple white space characters are normalized to onespace.R1-2.22 Notation  A mechanism for defining a data format for a non-XML document referenced as an unparsedentity. This is a holdover from SGML that creaks a bit. The newer standard is to use MIME data types andnamespaces to prevent naming conflicts.R1-2.23 OASIS  Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards.

The element that contains all other elements.R1-2.32 SAX  Simple API for XML. An event-driven interface in which the parser invokes one of severalmethods supplied by the caller when a parsing event occurs. Events include recognizing an XML tag, finding anerror, encountering a reference to an external entity, or processing a schema specification.R1-2.33 Schema  A database-inspired method for specifying constraints on XML documents using an XML-based language. Schemas address deficiencies in DTDs, such as the inability to put constraints on the kinds of datathat can occur in a particular field (for example, all numeric). Since schemas are founded on XML, they arehierarchical, so it is easier to create an unambiguous specification, and possible to determine the scope over which acomment is meant to apply.R1-2.34 SGML  Standard Generalized Markup Language. The parent of both HTML and XML. However, whileHTML shares SGMLs propensity for embedding presentation information in the markup, XML is a standard thatallows information content to be totally separated from the mechanisms for rendering/displaying that content.R1-2.35 Tag  A piece of text that describes a unit of data, or element, in XML. The tag is distinguishable asmarkup, as opposed to data, because it is surrounded by angle brackets (","<"," and ",">","). For example, the elementMy Name has the start tag , the end tag , which enclose the data My Name.To treat such markup syntax as data, you use an entity reference or a CDATA section.R1-2.36 Unicode  A standard defined by the Unicode Consortium that uses a 16-bit code page which mapsdigits to characters in languages around the world.

A URI is an abstract superclass -- its a name we can use when we know weare dealing with either an URL or an URN, and we dont care which.R1-2.39 URL  Universal Resource Locator. A pointer to a specific location (address) on the Web that is unique inthe entire world. The first part of the URL defines the type of address. For example, http:/ identifies a Web location.The ftp:/ prefix identifies a downloadable file. Other prefixes include file:/ (a file on the local disk system) andmailto:/ (an email address).R1-2.40 URN  Universal Resource Name. A unique identifier that identifies an entity, but doesnt tell where it islocated. That lets the system look it up to see if a local copy exists before going out to find it on the Web. It alsoallows the web location to change, while still allowing the object to be found.R1-2.41 Valid  A valid XML document, in addition to being well formed, conforms to all the constraints imposedby a schema. In other words, it does not contain any tags that are not permitted by the schemas, and the order of thetags conforms to the or schemas specifications.R1-2.42 Validating Parser  A validating parser is a parser that ensures that an XML document is valid, as well aswell formed.

To use XHTMLfor everything would of course defeat the purpose of XML, since the idea of XML is to identify information content,not just tell how to display it. XHTML makes the conversion from HTML to XML, though. You can also referenceit in a schema, which allows you to say, for example, that the text in an element can contain ",(0,i.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"and ",(0,i.yg)("strong",{parentName:"em"},"tags,rather than being limited to plain text.R1-2.47 XLink  The part of the XLL specification that is concerned with specifying links between documents.R1-2.48 XLL  The XML Link Language specification, consisting of XLink and XPointer.R1-2.49 XML  Extensible Markup Language, which allows you to define the tags (markup) that you need toidentify the data and text in XML documents.R1-2.50 XML Schema  The w3c schema specification for XML documents.R1-2.51 XPath  See XSL.R1-2.52 Xpointer  The part of the XLL specification that is concerned with identifying sections of documents sothat they can referenced in links or included in other documents.R1-2.53 XSL  Extensible Stylesheet Language.

Astate model consists of a processing state modeldiagram, processing state definitions, and a processingstate transition table. A state model represents thehosts view of the virtual tester, but not necessarily theactual tester operations. All TSEM state modeltransitions shall be mapped sequentially into the actualequipment events that satisfy the requirements of thosetransitions. In certain implementations, the tester mayenter a state and have already satisfied all of theconditions required by the TSEM state model fortransition to another state. In this situation, the testermakes the required transition without any additionalactions.6.2.2 Some equipment may need to include additionalstates.

SETTING UP 7 Virtual Testers7.1 General Definitions7.1.1 The virtual tester is defined as a single loadinstance of a test program (regardless of how many test-sites, test system resources, or test-heads are associatedwith that instance) that is capable of operating as anindependent tester in accordance with the state modelshown in this document.7.1.2 Loading another instance of the same testprogram, which uses separate or shared test systemhardware resources, establishes another virtual tester.The multiple copies of that test program areindependent of each other. In this context, programindependence describes the condition that one virtualtester program does not expect or rely on the existenceof another virtual tester program in order to run.7.1.3 For a single test system with one test-head thatmust be dedicated to a single test program, the physicaltester and virtual tester are the same and a single GEMcommunication interface is needed. In a test systemwith two test-heads, where each test-head can execute aunique process program autonomously, two virtualtesters may be operating at the same time with twoGEM communication sessions. If a test-head may bedivided into several segments, each capable ofautonomous execution of a unique program, there willbe one virtual tester and one matching GEMcommunication session for each of those segments.7.1.4 The number of virtual testers operating at anytime depends on how the test system is configured(hardware and software) and may range from one to themaximum capability of the particular test system. The number of GEM communication sessions is equal to thenumber of virtual testers supported by the tester.7.2 GEM Communication Sessions7.2.1 From the GEM communication host connection,only one program and virtual tester exists and the hostGEM communication connection has no knowledge orview of other virtual testers. Independence does notpreclude the tester executive or test hardware fromsharing resources between virtual testers, such as in thecase of power supplies or shared software libraries.7.2.2 For each virtual tester, the test system mustprovide a separate GEM client connection. The testsystem controller has responsibility to manage themultiple client connections.7.2.3 For each virtual tester the station controllerestablishes a unique host connection to a single testerGEM client. The station controller has responsibility tomanage the multiple host connections.7.2.4 The test system will have a set maximum numberof allowable unique GEM host/client connections. Themaximum number of connections (n) and the port IDsfor these GEM communication connections areconstants known to the station controller and availablefrom the test system controller after that controller isbooted.7.2.5 The maximum number of GEM communicationsessions allowed by the test system is also themaximum number of virtual testers allowed by the testsystem, regardless of the number and allocation oftester resources."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 27 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E122-0703 \xa9 SEMI 2003 8 7.2.6 Each unique virtual tester host/client connectionis an independent GEM communication session. Thefollowing hierarchy relationship can be established.7.2.7 GEM Communication session (1 ... n) acceptsprogram load instances (1 ... n) which uses testerhardware resources (x ... y) which establishes VirtualTester (1 ... n). This relationship does not imply anyorder of assignment. The station controller can selectany available GEM communication port in order to loada program and establish a virtual tester.7.2.8 Multiple station controllers can address a singlephysical test system, with each station controllerestablishing its own virtual testers, until the physicallimit for the test system is met.7.3 GEM Communication Synchronicity to Virtual andPhysical Tester7.3.1 The GEM communication client interface mustrepresent the actual real time state of the related virtualtester at all times.7.3.2 Events from outside the GEM communicationinterface, such as local operator actions, can cause statetransitions to occur.7.3.3 Synchronization of the virtual tester to physicaltester events (from any source) is required.7.3.4 The methodologies and effectiveness of thisvirtual tester to physical tester synchronization isoutside the scope of the TSEM and is the responsibilityof the test vendor.7.4 GEM communication Sessions and Alarms7.4.1 Any alarm condition that impacts more than onevirtual tester must be communicated to all impactedvirtual testers.7.5 State Model Implications7.5.1 When the test system workstation is powered up,and the workstation operating system (O/S)successfully loads, (n) GEM communication port IDswill be established and made available for the stationcontroller. Each GEM communication port represents apotential virtual tester. Each GEM communication portwill have a fully independent process state model,which initializes into the GEM READY state.7.5.2 The station controller can connect to andestablish a GEM communication session with any ofthe available GEM communication ports. Once thestation controller establishes a GEM communicationsession, the remote command START EXEC will loadthe tester executive and, if successful, cause the processstate model for that GEM communication session orvirtual tester to transition to the IDLE state. Thistransition is wholly independent of any other GEM communication sessions. The other GEM sessionsremain in their original states.Example: The host issues the first START EXEC toGEM communication port #1. The virtual testertransitions to INIT and starts the Tester Executivewhich in turn initializes all hardware. If successful, thevirtual tester then transitions to IDLE. GEMcommunication ports 2 through (n) remain in alogical GEM READY state even though the physicaltest system has started the Tester Executive.7.5.3 If a previous START EXEC remote command toa different GEM communication session on the sametester workstation has already started the testerexecutive, and the tester executive can support multiplevirtual testers, then the new GEM communicationsession can transition to the IDLE state without startinga new tester executive.7.5.4 The station controller can issue a STOP EXECremote command to an active virtual tester. If anothervirtual tester is running in that test system, the virtualtester that received the remote command will transitionto the GEM READY state, but leave the testerexecutive running. If no other virtual testers arecurrently running on that test system, the test systemcan shut down the tester executive.7.6 Physical Resources and Virtual Testers7.6.1 For the case of a multi-site virtual tester, eachtest-site should be uniquely identified without having toidentify the test-head associated with that test-site.7.6.2 Once a GEM communication session or virtualtester is in the IDLE state, the station controller canissue the PP-SELECT remote command. Until a PP-SELECT has been issued to a virtual tester, and theSETTING UP state is entered, the GEMcommunication session exists only as acommunications path to a potential virtual tester.7.6.3 In the SETTING UP state, the test system willdetermine whether the physical hardware resourcesrequired for that test program are available. If theresources are available, they are reserved for this virtualtester, the test program loads, SETTING UP processstate is successful, and the virtual tester transitions toREADY. If the physical hardware resources requiredfor that test program are not available, the SETTINGUP process state fails, the virtual tester has an ALARM,and it returns to the IDLE state. Before entering theIDLE state, all resources that have been reserved duringSETTING UP must be freed.7.6.4 Depending on the architecture of the test system,the hardware resources may or may not be tied to aspecific virtual tester."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 28 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E122-0703 \xa9 SEMI 20039 Example: A test system with three test-heads might require the use of virtual tester 1 to address test-head 1, virtualtester 2 to address test-head 2, and virtual tester 3 to address test-head 3. If a process-program requiring theresources of two test-heads is loaded on virtual tester 1, it might assign both test-head 1 and test-head 2 to thatvirtual tester. An attempt to load a program on virtual tester 2 would then fail, but a program might still be loadedto virtual tester 3.7.6.5 If all test-sites on a test-head are disabled, the test-head itself may be considered to be disabled. If a test-headis disabled the test-head may be undocked from the unit handling equipment and the test-board may be removedfrom the test-head. Commands to enable test-sites on a test-head that is not connected to the test-board or is notdocked should fail. Testing should be able to proceed on test-sites on other test-heads.7.6.5.1 If a virtual tester includes test-sites on more than one test-head, disabling a test-head should not preventtesting from continuing on the test-sites on other test-heads. 8 Collection Event List8.1 Requirements8.1.1 All defined TSEM process state model state transitions are required collection events. In addition to definedprocess state model state transition collection events, the following collection events are also required.Table 3 Additional Required Collection Events Collection Event Name Collection Event DescriptionTestBoardChange A test-board is attached, removed, or changed.DockStatusChange The test-head is docked or undocked from the materials handler.EnableSite A previously disabled test-site is enabled.DisableSite A previously enabled test-site is disabled. 9 Variable Items9.1 The purpose of this section is to define the list of variable items required by the TSEM. Values of thesevariables will be available to the host through collection event reports and host status queries.9.2 Requirements9.2.1 Variable items required by TSEM are categorized as follows: Common Variables (CVs)  Variables common to all testers. Configuration-Specific Variables (CSVs)  Variables associated with a specific configuration of the aboveequipment class.9.2.2 Equipment constants have various uses in TSEM, including the following: Equipment offsets that match the performance of several pieces of equipment that would otherwise performdifferently due to inherent manufacturing differences. Examples are home values and motion axis scalingfactors. Setting the configuration of the equipment to allow for different material specifications, equipment options,material flows, frequency of automatic functions, etc. An example is yield check frequency. Managing optional machine features. Examples are constants that indicate whether optional features such asautomated media stackers are present and control the configuration and function of these optional subsystemswhen they are present. Equipment Constants can be changed by the user but are not modified by the equipment. Its value can bequeried by the host at any time. Equipment constants remain in effect until they are modified by the user.9.2.3 Status Variables are valid at all times. A status variable may not be changed by the host but may be changedby the equipment or operator. The value of status variables may be queried by the host at anytime."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 29 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E122-0703 \xa9 SEMI 2003 10 9.2.4 Data Variables are valid only upon the occurrence of specific collection events. Data variables may bequeried by the host. An attempt to read a data variable item at the wrong time does not generate an error, but thedata reported may not have relevant meaning.9.2.5 Data Item Requirements for Multi-Head, Multi-Site Equipment  Some variables may change valuedepending on the processing state (whether or not resources are allocated to a virtual tester). See definition ofVirtual Tester.Example: If calibration is done separately on two test-heads, and a virtual tester has been allocated resources onlyfrom the more recently calibrated test-head, CalDate for that virtual tester may have a more recent date in theREADY state than it did in the IDLE state.9.3 class, hard-bin, and soft-bin  Equipment is to maintain variables that provide three levels of granularity fortest results: class, hard-bin, and soft-bin. Classes, hard-bins, and soft-bins are defined within a process program, andtheir values are made available during events. When unit testing has completed, the process program is to determinethe class, hard-bin, and soft-bin with which the unit is to be associated, based on the results of the testing.9.4 Variable Item TablesTable 4 Variable Item TableVariable Name Category Description Format CommentsActiveSites CV List of test-sites that are to be tested.

The first type is the collection event report. Collection event reports areassociated with process state model transition events or other non-transition collection events as described in Section8.1.1 . The second type is the datalog report. Datalog reports are not specifically associated with a collection eventand are intended to provide the host with test measurement result data.10.2 User-configured Reports  The host shall be provided a mechanism to configure additional reports of eithertype. The method for defining either type of report and associating them with either collection events or datalogrequirements shall be the same.10.3 Report Messages  Collection event reports and datalog reports shall be provided to the host via two separatemessage services. This requirement is designed to prevent the larger datalog reports from impacting the executionspeed of the process state model.10.4 Collection Event Reports  The following reports are required as pre-configured collection event reports. Thespecific format of the report should follow the format provided by the collection event message definition.Table 6 Collection Event ReportsReport Label DescriptionMust be valid On process state transition 3.In READY, EXECUTING and PAUSE states.Description Provides information on the general process program and test hardware setup.TestHeadIDDockingStatusTestBoardIDPPExecName SETUP-REPORT Parameters PPExecVersion"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 33 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E122-0703 \xa9 SEMI 2003 14 Report Label DescriptionMust be valid On process state transition 5.In READY and PAUSE States.Description Provides test result information.SiteIDUnitIDHardBinIDSoftBinID BIN-DATA-REPORT Parameters ClassIDMust be valid With the EnableSite or DisableSite collection event.In READY, EXECUTING and PAUSE states.Description Used to notify the host that a test-site has been enabled or disabled.

The following is also required. Theprocess program must have a structure that enables theuser to build process programs with default conditionsthat can be overridden at run time via parametersspecified in the PP-SELECT remote command. When a process program is downloaded to theequipment by the host, the process program syntaxshall be verified by the equipment. The downloaded process parameters shall bechecked for type and range before execution. Anerror message must be generated from the tester ifthe process program parameters are outside therange of the machine capability. The contents of the downloaded process programbody (PPBODY) may contain the explicit para-meters and data necessary for the runtime processprogram, or the body may contain referenceinformation (i.e., PATH location) on where theexplicit data is stored. In the latter case, it isrequired that the equipment combines or compilesthe reference data prior to the verification step.11.2 Diagnostic and calibration routines are consideredprocess programs and must be verified and validatedthe same as a typical process program. 12 Alarm Management12.1 Alarm Definition12.1.1 The TSEM requires a broader definition ofalarms than is provided by SEMI E30. The alarm definitions provided by SEMI E5 provide this broaderdefinition. SEMI E5 provides for eight (8) categoriesof alarms:1. personal safety  Condition may be dangerous topeople.2. equipment safety  Condition may harmequipment.3. parameter control warning  Parameter variationoutside of preset limits  may harm product.4. parameter control error  Parameter variationoutside of reasonable control limits  mayindicate an equipment malfunction.5. irrecoverable error  Intervention required beforenormal use of equipment can resume.6. equipment status warning  An unexpectedcondition has occurred, but operation can continue.7. attention flags  A signal from a process programindicating that a particular step has been reached.8. data integrity  A condition that may cause lossof data.12.1.2 It will be the equipments responsibility tocategorize the alarm. Some alarm conditions maycause more than one type of alarm to be issued. Forexample, a parameter control error for over voltage mayalso trip a protective device that makes the alarmirrecoverable without some intervention.12.2 Relationship to ALARM PAUSED Process State12.2.1 The relationship between an alarm conditionand the ALARM PAUSED process state should bedefined by the equipment manufacturer on a case-by-case basis along these guidelines."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 37 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E122-0703 \xa9 SEMI 2003 18 1. An alarm does not necessarily require a processstate change to ALARM PAUSED even though itmay ultimately prove to be the root cause of thattransition at a later time.2. Alarms that force immediate processing stoppagefor the primary function of the tool should trigger atransition to ALARM PAUSED.3. Most alarms in categories 13 will cause atransition to ALARM PAUSED.12.2.2 A machine with currently set alarms mayPAUSE instead of ALARM PAUSED if none of thecurrently set alarms were the immediate trigger for thetransition. 13 Remote Commands13.1 The purpose of this section is to identify remotecommands, command parameters, and valid commandsversus states in the processing state models.13.2 Requirements The equipment must support the GEM-requiredremote commands. (Some of the SEMI E30-required remote commands are restated here todefine TSEM-specific requirements.) All the remote commands defined by TSEM arerequired. The alphanumeric strings defined by TSEM forremote commands and command parameters arerequired. If additional remote commands are supported, thenthe Remote Command versus Valid States matrixmust be generated for these additional commands.Place an X in the table for each state in which agiven command is valid.13.3 Remote Commands and TSEM Process ModelMapping13.3.1 Table 9 illustrates the relationship betweenremote commands and states of the TSEM processingstate model. An X indicates that a command is validfor use in this state. If a remote command is attemptedduring a non-valid state, the equipment would reject theremote command.13.4 Remote Command Descriptions13.4.1 ABORT  This command terminates thecurrent processing. ABORT makes no guarantee aboutcompletion of the current test(s). 13.4.2 PAUSE  This command transitions the testerto the PAUSING process state when the current test(s)completes processing.13.4.3 RESUME  This command resumes processingfrom the point where the process was PAUSED.Process program variable parameters can be specifiedin this command that modify the default values forthese variable parameters in the process program.Process program verification (CHECKING state) mustoccur when variable parameters accompany thiscommand.13.4.4 PP-SELECT  This command instructs thetester to copy the indicated Process Program from non-volatile storage to the testers process programexecution area. Process program variable parameterscan be specified in this command that modify thedefault values for these variable parameters in theprocess program. Process program verification mustoccur when variable parameters accompany thiscommand.13.4.5 DEFINE-DATALOG-PLAN  This commanddefines and names a datalog plan. The STARTcommand may subsequently activate the datalog planby name.13.4.6 START  This command is only available tothe host or operator when a process program has beenselected and the tester is in the READY processingstate. The START command instructs the tester toinitiate processing. Parameters can be specified in thiscommand.13.4.7 STOP  This command completes the currenttest(s), stops in a safe condition, and returns to theIDLE processing state. STOP has the intent of bringingabout a normal termination after completion of thecurrent test(s).13.4.8 START EXEC  This command instructs thetester to start the tester executive.13.4.9 STOP EXEC  This command instructs thetester to stop the tester executive.13.4.10 ENABLE-SITE  This command instructs thetester to persistently re-enable a test-site previouslydisabled via the DISABLE-SITE remote command.Parameters can be specified in this command.13.4.11 DISABLE-SITE  This command instructs thetester to persistently disable a test-site originallyenabled via the PP-SELECT remote command.Parameters can be specified in this command."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 38 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E122-0703 \xa9 SEMI 200319 13.5 Associated Remote Command ParametersTable 8 Remote CommandsCommand Name Parameter Name Opt./Req.

The SELECT-TEST-SITE parameter on the START remote command establishes a single execution subset ofthe initial default set of test-sites established with the PP-SELECT remote command.3. The ENABLE-SITE and DISABLE-SITE remote commands provide for a persistent override of the initialdefault set of test-sites to be established with the PP-SELECT remote command. The DISABLE-SITE remote command will persistently disable a test-site originally enabled via theENABLE-SITE parameter of the PP-SELECT remote command. The ENABLE-SITE remote command will persistently re-enable a test-site that was disabled via theDISABLE-SITE remote command. The ENABLE-SITE remote command may not enable a test-site that was not initially enabled via theENABLE-SITE parameter on the PP-SELECT remote command.13.7 Remote Commands and TSEM Process Model Mapping13.7.1 Table 9 illustrates the relationship between remote commands and states of the TSEM processing statemodel.

Becauseequipment configurations vary for datalog content andformat, the equipment manufacturer must document theformat and content of datalog information used by theequipment and make that information available acrossthe communications interface. A test data acquisitioninterface and mechanism for management of test datacollection is described below.15.3 Datalog Plan  The datalog plan describes amethod by which the host can request test result data tobe communicated in an automated fashion by theequipment. It specifies the set of data in which Host isinterested in and that the equipment should send off-tool. It includes a mechanism for organizing relateddata into groups or categories to make it morestraightforward for Host to enable or disable a large number of data sources, and to allow Host to organizerelated data into groups according to their purpose.15.4 Defining a Datalog Plan  The remote commandDEFINE-DATALOG-PLAN will assign a name to a setof reports and datasets. Named datalog plans defined inthis manner are undefined when the tester leaves thePROCESSING ACTIVE state. There must be onepredefined datalog plan called NONE that willdisable all datalog reports.15.5 Test Data Types  The types of test data that arecommonly collected are described in the followingsections, grouped by the type of test that generated thedata. This list, which may not be exhaustive, representsthe minimum required data to be supported by the testequipment. In datalog plans, the TestType can be usedto enable or disable an entire group of data to becommunicated to the host; see TestType data variablefor enumerated values of TestTypes. Upon loading ofthe test recipe or process program, the test equipmentshould have knowledge of all test steps as well as theirrespective TestTypes.15.5.1 Functional Test Data  Test data associatedwith a functional test, such as pattern name and thefunctional test result. Functional test results arenormally a vector of pass/fail values.15.5.2 Parametric Test Data  Test data associatedwith a parametric test. Parametric test results arenormally a measured value from within a range.15.5.3 Text Test Data  Test data associated with atext test. Text test results contain an arbitrary string oftext.15.6 Test Steps  Upon successful completion ofprocess program load, the tester should have fullknowledge of all the functional, parametric, etc. teststeps defined by the process program. Each test step isuniquely identified by a test step ID and associated witha TestType. Information on all test steps defined mustbe available to Host via defined reports and can beattached to program load complete collection event, seeTEST-LIST report.15.7 Collection Plan Definition  Definition of adatalog plan to the equipment specifies the exact testdata to be collected and/or communicated to the hostand specifies a way to group data.

It also specifies away to group the data into data sets based on test-site.15.7.2 Dataset  The Dataset defines a grouping ofdata based on test-site of unit data. One or more test-sites may be specified for each dataset. If no test-site isspecified, all test-sites is assumed. Each Dataset isassociated with a name.15.7.3 TestSite  TestSite specifies the processingtest-site of the unit where test data was produced.15.7.4 TestTypeData  TestTypeData defines the datato be collected for a particular TestType (functional,parametric etc) via an attached data report definition.15.7.4.1 TestType  Specifies the type of test forwhich to collect data on via the attached reportdefinition.15.7.4.2 TestStatus  Specifies the pass/fail status oftest for which data will be communicated to host.15.7.5 TestStepData  TestStepData defines the datato be collected for a particular test via an attached datareport definition. TestID specifies the ID of the test asprovided by the TEST-LIST report, and TestStatusspecifies pass/fail condition for which data will becommunicated to host. 15.7.6 TestReport  TestReport defines the structuredformat and the data variables to communicate to host.The ReportID uniquely identifies the report defined inthe equipment.15.8 Test Data Reporting  Test data reporting isenabled by specifying a DATALOG-PLAN parameterin the START command or by defining an unnameddatalog plan in the STARTcommand using theDATALOG-DATASETS, DATALOG-BY-TESTTYPE, DATALOG-BY-TESTID, andDATALOG-OPTIONS parameters. If no datalog planis specified in the START command, the last supplieddatalog plan is used. Initially (after a PP-SELECT), alltest data reporting will be disabled (using datalog planNONE). The unnamed plan defined in the STARTcommand will be undefined as soon as another datalogplan is activated.15.8.1 Sample test data reporting can be done bysetting the DATALOG-PLAN to NONE and then,every once in a while, setting it to another datalog planthat generates the desired reports.15.8.2 If limited test data reporting is desired at alltimes, but full test data reporting is required on asample basis, two datalog plans can be defined and eachSTART command can indicate the appropriate datalogplan."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 44 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E122-0703 \xa9 SEMI 200325 15.9 Collection Plan Activation  The collection plan is communicated to equipment as parameters to the STARTremote command, with one parameter specifying the Dataset, TestTypeData and TestStepData definitionsrespectively. An additional parameter is also included to globally enable or disable all test data collection forprocess program. The parameters are DATALOG-DATASETS, DATALOG-BY-TESTTYPE, DATALOG-BY-TESTID, and DATALOG-OPTIONS.
