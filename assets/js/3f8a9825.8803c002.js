R1-1 Alpha ValuesR1-1.1 A transport module in the shape of an N-sidedregular polygon possesses an alpha value of 360/N (seeSection 4.1 and Figure 1). R1-2 Transport Module Side LengthR1-2.1 The specified transport module side length (L)of 420 mm (16.54 in.) given in Table 2 is a minimumvalue that will ensure clearance at the interface planevalve (see SEMI E21), assuming a 340 mm (13.39 in.)flange width at the interface plane plus additionalclearance for side-mounted clamps. The side length isspecified as a minimum value since a single transportmodule could have various side lengths and/or alphavalues. Longer side lengths may ease access to thetransport module, but will have the negative impact ofincreasing the transport module handler extension,which is the distance from the common point (in Figure1) to the wafer transport position (defined in SEMIE22). For a radial cluster tool with the transport modulehandler having the "home" position at the commonpoint, the maximum extension in millimeters is relatedto the side length, alpha, and the transport maximumreach, which is specified as 305 mm (12 in.) in SEMIE21 by: L2   tan 90 2  + 305 R1-3 Evaluation of Footprint ShapesR1-3.1 Access (see Section 4.1) for a variety ofpurposes is severely restricted in a radial cluster tool,because all modules converge toward one areR1-Achieving access to clamps at the interface plane and tothe module (usually a process module) in proximity tothe interface plane is especially difficult. Thus, severalfootprint shapes were modelled: A radial architecturecomprising an N-sided regular polygon transportmodule with L = 420 mm (see Table 2 and Section R1-2) was used, and the dimensional effects on the modulefootprint were investigated for 4 \u2264 N \u2264 10. Anatomicaldata was used to evaluate access to various parts of theradial cluster tool. The configuration chosen provides ashort, fat footprint. It allows maximum freedom for themodule designer and accommodates modules near theinterface plane without forcing the design of additionalwafer transport mechanisms. Guidance in setting W1 and W2 values (see Figure 1) was provided by the needfor a single wafer sputter module to be placed directlyon an N = 8 regular polygon transport module and abatch processing module with an intermediate "buffer"station on the same transport module. R1-4 Module Width at Interface PlaneR1-4.1 Although L can be longer than 420 mm (16.54in.), the module attached to the transport module cannotpossess a width greater than 400 mm (15.75 in.) at theinterface plane in order to be interchangeable among alltransport module interfaces (see Figure 1). R1-5 Flexibility for Module SuppliersR1-5.1 Module footprint dimensions (calculated fromthe expressions in Table 2) and transport modulehandler extensions (calculated from the expression inSection R1-2) for L = 420 mm and for selected valuesof alpha are given in Table A1 to provide guidance forweighing design targets. Alpha values corresponding tovalues of N for an N-sided regular polygon transportmodule are noted.R1-5.2 Modules designed for an N = 8 ( = 45)transport module will fit on any transport module withN \u2264 8 ( \u2264 45), providing for greater flexibility, butpossessing a more restrictive footprint, than a moduledesigned for an N = 6 ( = 60) transport module. R1-6 Nonradial Cluster Tool ApplicabilityR1-6.1 An example of a nonradial transport module isshown in Figure R1-1. Sides 1, 3, 4, and 5 of thetransport module are equivalent to a radial cluster tool.The standard applies to these four sides (see Section4.1). R1-7 Restricted AreasR1-7.1 Access (see Section 4.2) for maintenanceactivities that involve the lifting of heavy componentsor crouching, requires a minimum separation of 2 AM= 915 mm (36 in.) between integrated module hardware(see Table 2). When a width of 915 mm (36 in.) for theentire restricted area was used in the model (see SectionR1-3), it became apparent that footprints wouldcomprise narrow corridors. This would force the designof buffer chambers and additional wafer handlingmechanisms for many applications. For practicalpurposes, the concept of a smaller reach area (thehatched region in Figure R1-2), where the moduleshould be detached from the transport module for heavylifting or crouching tasks, was considered acceptable.'),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 6 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E26-92 \xa9 SEMI 1992, 20045 R1-7.2 Dependence on L  A transport module sidelength (L) greater than the minimum value of 420.0 mmwill result in a larger restricted area by increasing thehalf widths AM, A R, and a beyond their respectiveminimum values of 457.5 mm, 360.0 mm, and10cos","[","/2","]",' mm (see Table 2).R1-7.3 Restricted Area Temporary Residence Equipment such as roll-out drawers or swing-outequipment may temporarily reside in the restricted area(see Section 4.2). R1-8 Restriction on AlphaR1-8.1 The maximum value of alpha was based on anN = 4 ( = 90) regular polygon transport moduledesign (see Section 4.3).R1-8.2 In order for a module manufacturer toadequately design for access, some knowledge of the adjacent modules must be available. This can be doneby setting a minimum value for alpha, which thendefines the adjacent footprint leading to the moststringent "half" access area. For the purposes of thestandard, the minimum value of alpha was based on anN = 10 ( = 36) regular polygon transport module (seeFigure R1-2). R1-9 Module Connect and DisconnectR1-9.1 The number of components and the degree ofcomplexity at the interfaces of a radial cluster tool arehigh. To ensure non-interference between modules, theconcept of an impenetrable wall at the interface planeand adjacent module footprints should be used. Withinthis area, requirements for module connect anddisconnect are the responsibility of the modulemanufacturer (see Section 4.4).

Alinearity specification is used to allow prediction to aknown level of uncertainty, the output of an MFC atpoints other than those at which its output is known. 2 Scope2.1 The scope is to define the linearity of the mass flowcontroller (controller with integral flow transducer andcontrol valve) and the mass flow meter (flow transduceronly). Terminal-based linearity is used to describe thelinearity of MFCs and MFMs.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Background3.1 There are three commonly-used methods ofdescribing linearity: independent, zero-referenced, andterminal-based linearity. Terminal-based linearity bestdescribes the performance requirements for MFCs andMFMs because of its ease of application. In addition, italso yields the maximum expression of deviation.

The Pascalis the preferred unit of pressure for use within thesemiconductor industry. Units of pressure include thefollowing: Pascal (Pa) Pounds per square inch (psi) Torr (T) Kilograms per square centimeter (kg/cm2) Bar (B) NOTE 1: Units of pressure are sometimes expressed as anequivalent height of a column of some liquid, such asmillimeters of mercury or inches of water. These unitsrequire correction to some standard for liquid density andgravity. As these corrections are neither broadly standardizednor often even addressed, their use should be avoided.4.1.2 absolute pressure  the pressure measuredrelative to zero pressure (perfect vacuum) (see Figure1).NOTE 2: Absolute pressure is the pressure illustrated by theideal gas law, PV = nRT. For example, when the number ofmoles, n, equals zero (no molecules), absolute pressure, P,equals zero. To indicate unambiguously that a pressuremeasurement is absolute, the following abbreviations shouldbe used: Pa  Pascal (absolute assumed) psi (a)  Pounds per square inch, absolute Torr  Torr (absolute assumed) kg/cm2(a)  Kilograms per square centimeter, absolute B (a)  Bar, absolute4.1.2.1 Units such as Pascal and Torr are customarilyabsolute units.

Figure 3Definition of Differential Pressure for MFCs 4.1.6 gauge pressure  the differential pressuremeasured relative to ambient pressure. For example,when the pressure within a system equals the prevailingambient pressure, the gauge pressure equals zero (seeFigure 1).NOTE 4: To indicate unambiguously that a pressuremeasurement is gauge, the following abbreviations should beused: Pa (g)  Pascal, gauge psi (g)  Pounds per square inch, gauge Torr (g)  Torr, gauge kg/cm2  Kilograms per square centimeter, gauge B (g)  Bar, gaugeNOTE 5: The performance of MFCs can vary significantlywith gas density. Atmospheric pressure varies with theweather and altitude at various geographical locations. Gaugepressure units commonly reference atmospheric pressure.Therefore, the same gauge pressures measured at differentgeographical locations may correspond to different gasdensities. For this reason, the use of gauge pressure unitswith MFCs can be imprecise and should be avoided.4.1.7 inlet pressure  the pressure at the inlet fittingof the MFC (see Figure 3).4.1.8 maximum operating pressure  operation ispermitted up to this inlet pressure, but performance isnot specified above normal operating pressure (seeFigure 2).4.1.9 maximum overrange pressure  the maximumgas pressure to which the MFC may be subjectedwithout degrading specified performance.

A.1 Appendix A: Charged Wafer TestingDue to overriding microcontamination concerns, non-static-dissipative wafer carriers must be used duringsemiconductor fabrication. It is suggested that anyequipment which handles wafers be tested with waferscharged to 18 kV/in. The charge generator used for801-2 testing can be used to charge the wafer. Someexperimentation will be required to determine the bestmeans to carry out this test. Alternately, the handlingmechanism may be challenged by air or contactdischarge directed to the mechanism.It is suggested that wafer handlers be designed todissipate charge on incoming wafers in a controlled,non-sparking manner. A simple AM radio tunedbetween stations and placed near the handler has beenfound to be a good qualitative means to detect sparking.Sparking will result in pops and static being heard onthe radio. A.2 Appendix B: ESD Test MethodsAlthough the contact method of ESD testing has beenfound to be much more reproducible than the airdischarge, the air discharge is a more realisticsimulation of possible events that can occur in thesemiconductor factory. Also, the air discharge methodis the only realistic way to test objects that are primarilyfabricated from insulators, such as wet stations andkeyboards.In addition to testing surfaces that come in contact withhumans and wafers, it is important to test any area ofthe equipment that can be exposed to ESD. Forinstance, wet stations are composed of assembliesinvolving large masses of insulators in proximity tometallic sensors and controllers. It is possible for theinsulating surfaces to build up charge, which thensparks to a sensor or controller  all internal to theequipment itself. A.3 Appendix C: Future DirectionsItems in this section are not requirements of thisstandard, but are included to indicate currently ill-defined goals for further improvements tosemiconductor factory EMC.A.3.1 Static Charge  Minimization of static chargepromotes cleanliness, and avoids damage to material inprocess and reticles. It is suggested that electrostatic fields be held to under200 V/cm (500 V/in). This would be applicable topersonnel, wafers, cassettes, cassette boxes, reticles,reticle boxes, and all equipment and facility surfaces inproximity to these items as well as all surfaces exposedto filtered airflow. Measurements shall be made using aproperly-grounded electrostatic field meter inaccordance with its manufacturer's instructions.

Originally published in 1995; previously published March 2004. NOTICE: This document was completely rewritten in 2005. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this guide is to provide standard metrics for evaluating unit production cost effectiveness ofmanufacturing equipment in the semiconductor industry.1.2 This guide establishes a well-defined procedure to facilitate an understanding of equipment-related costs byproviding definitions, classifications, algorithms, methods, and default values necessary to build a full or constrainedcost of ownership (COO) calculator.NOTE 1: Related Information 1 provides a graphical representation of calculating COO to expand upon the guide text. 2 Scope2.1 This guide is applicable to any type of equipment for processing semiconductor units, which may be wafers,devices, flat panels or other material. Some terms are specialized to integrated circuit wafer and device production.2.2 Effective use of the metric to build a COO model requires identification of constraints and data values. Wherepossible, use direct values for inputs rather than deriving them from secondary models or using example values.NOTE 2: Related Information 2 provides some example data.2.3 Full calculation of COO often requires data held proprietary and is coupled to the overall factory yield and therelated cost of yield loss. It is envisioned that this guide will be used for internal factory and equipmentoptimization, investment evaluation, and equipment design improvements.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Certain cost factors are more difficult than others to accurately determine. Figure 1 depicts the relationship ofsome of the COO model input factors to ability to collect and validate them. The accuracy of a COO calculationmay be prone to a variety of errors or omissions.3.2 Line balance considerations are not included in the COO calculation. Line balance considerations are notincluded because it is difficult, in an individual COO model, to show the impact of equipment being modeled on thecomplete manufacturing facility. A factory-level cost model should be used for this purpose.3.3 A COO calculation may have more detail than presented explicitly in this guide.

COO is calculated on anannualized basis. The metric is expressed as cost per good unit for one pass through the equipment.

An example is a baseline COO that only includes EY (i.e., DLY and PLY are not included.6.2.2 Constraints should be predefined by all stakeholders in a specific equipment COO model, prior to estimatingCOO, to minimize biasing of the COO estimate.6.3 Lifetimes6.3.1 The lifetime of a piece of equipment is the time over which the fixed and recurring costs are considered forevaluating the annualized COO.

Tax lifetime is based upon local tax or standard accounting practices.6.3.3 The piece of equipment usually remains in production much longer than the tax lifetime, so it is useful toconsider both lifetimes in evaluating COO.6.4 CEO: Fixed and Recurring Costs6.4.1 Determining CEO requires enumerating all of the fixed and recurring costs that are incurred in the life cycleof the piece of equipment. The calculation is shown in 8.6.4.2 Fixed costs are those incurred once and are usually associated with the acquisition and incorporation of apiece of equipment into the factory. End-of-life costs, such as decontamination and removal costs, are also part offixed costs.6.4.3 Recurring costs are those that arise on a regular basis from the operation and maintenance of the piece ofequipment. Some infrequent recurring costs, including the costs of upgrading a piece of equipment to newtechnologies may be included in fixed costs if the CEO is being calculated to compare an upgraded existing piece ofequipment with a new acquisition.6.4.3.1 Costs that are depreciated should be included as fixed costs.6.5 Yield6.5.1 Yield is a metric of the percentage of the unit volume that results in good product. Yield affects the COO in anumber of ways. Volume of units that must be processed for the required product requirements. Cost of units that do not produce good product.6.5.2 Product yield (PRY) is the percentage of units that pass through the factory and result in good product.Product yield for units is the composite yield from all sources of yield loss, as shown in Equation 4. Thecomponents are defined in 5.( ) ( ) ( )ReworkPLYDLYEYPRY = 111 (4)6.5.2.1 Since DLY is generally a wafer-level phenomena, Equation 4 may be simplified for other types of units bysetting DLY = 1. Particle additions are a predictor of defect yield loss at a future step, but not a complete predictorof all the possible loss since there may be other defects or parametric problems.6.5.2.2 The P/T ratio of test and measurement equipment also affects PRY. P/T ratio is reflected in Equation 4 bythe inclusion of  and . The formulas for calculating  and  are provided in Appendix 1.6.6 Cost of Yields6.6.1 A unit lost at the end of a given step represents the loss of the starting unit cost and all costs of manufacturinga unit prior to that step. In addition, units leaving a step with undetected defects may be lost at a later step.Calculating CYL therefore requires knowing the accumulated costs of manufacturing before the unit is lost.Therefore, although CYL is a recurring cost, it should be tracked separately. CYL is given in Equation 7 in 8.2.6.7 Volume Requirement6.7.1 The volume requirement is the number of units to be processed and can be derived from specification of theproduct units needed corrected for yield and the number of other units required to be processed by the equipment ina specific time period such as rework or monitor units. One complication in accurately estimating the volumerequirement is that the volume of units actually reaching the equipment will depend on the equipment yields from allprior steps.6.8 Equipment Required6.8.1 Once the volume of units is specified, the number of pieces of equipment required (ER) is obtained from theTP and the OU.ER = Volume Requirement / (TP  OU) (5)"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 39 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E35-0305 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2005 8 For CEO calculations, ER is a whole number.

A1-1 PurposeA1-1.1 In silicon manufacturing product disposition is typically contingent on metrology equipment output. Forexample, a unit may be shipped, scrapped, or reworked based on information from one or more measured outputcharacteristics.A1-1.2 This appendix provides a standard methodology to include the cost due to misclassification of productbecause of measurement variability and bias during testing of the product for conformance to a specification.A1-1.3 This appendix is also intended to be useful for pre-purchase evaluation of pieces of measurement equipmentwith different P/T ratios. It is also intended to be useful when comparing the operation of a single measurementinstrument in different throughput modes where P/T ratio changes with the throughput mode utilized or otherequipment setup factors. This appendix can help users select the optimum cost solution based on their specificprocess capability and requirements. A1-2 ScopeA1-2.1 This appendix covers a methodology to determine the alpha and beta probabilities associated withmisclassification of product due to variability and bias of measurement equipment. Alpha probability () isassociated with failing units that conform to specifications. Beta probability () is associated with passing units thatdo not conform to specifications.A1-2.2 This appendix can be applied to make relative misclassification cost comparisons as part of a COO analysisbetween two or more measurement gauges operating under conditions specified by the user. These conditions mayinclude any aspects of the measurement system affecting the measurement results directly or indirectly (e.g.,ambient conditions, throughput, recipe). This appendix can also be used to compare the relative costs of a singleinstrument under different operating conditions.A1-2.2.1 A measurement gauge is defined by a specific realization of systems and subsystems required to makemeasurements. Gauges that differ in at least one system or subsystem may be considered different for the purposeof comparison.A1-2.3 This appendix can be applied to any piece of metrology equipment or to the metrology portion of any pieceof equipment that includes metrology.A1-2.4 This appendix covers the case in which the piece of metrology equipment is used to make binary decisionsabout the item being measured, that is, only two outcomes are possible (e.g., pass/fail, go/no-go, ship/scrap).Models for decisions with more than two outcomes, such as the binning of data, are beyond the scope of thisAppendix.A1-2.5 To apply the formulae in this appendix, the user must estimate either the probability density function (PDF)or cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the process characteristic or characteristics of interest. Thedistributions can be based on a theoretical model or on empirical information obtained from manufacturing data.A1-2.6 To apply the formulae in this appendix, the user must be able to estimate all biases and variances associatedwith the piece of equipment being compared under the specified operating conditions and with respect to the processcharacteristic(s) of interest. These values can be obtained from a measurement system capability analysis (see SEMIE89).A1-2.7 This appendix does not consider costs associated with other components of uncertainty outside ofmeasurement variability and bias."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 44 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E35-0305 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 200513 A1-3 LimitationsA1-3.1 Application of this appendix requires that all measurement variances, biases, and process characteristicdistributions be accurately characterized. If this is not done, the resulting calculation may be in error.A1-3.2 Application of this appendix also requires that measurement variances and biases be constant over themeasurement range interval of interest. If this is not the case, the resulting calculation may be in error.A1-3.3 This appendix considers only the case of two convolved distributions, process characteristic variability andmeasurement variability; consideration of additional distributions (such as would be required if the measurementbias or variance were assumed to be a function of the measured value) is beyond the scope of this appendix.A1-3.4 Extension of the model to the cases of decisions based on (1) measurements on multiple gauges, (2)multiple inspections with the same gauge, or (3) on multiple characteristics is provided in A1-5. A1-4 ProcedureA1-4.1 Estimate the PDF for the process characteristic to be studied. This can be done using empirical data thatrepresents the process. Although actual data may be used to create a discrete PDF, it is sometimes convenient to usethe data to parametrically fit a PDF model (e.g., log normal).A1-4.2 Unless already known, establish the bias and standard deviation for each measurement gauge to becompared in accordance with SEMI E89.A1-4.3 In all cases take the measurement influence into account so that it does not broaden the PDF. This may bedone by taking repeated measurements at each point in the measurement range and calculating the mean, or bydeconvolving the process characteristic PDF, f(x), and the measurement variability CDF, G(u), generally assumed tobe a Gaussian (or normal) distribution with arithmetic mean equal to the bias, so that: ( ) ( ) ( ) xxuuGMu Md2exp21 22 ==  (1) where: = bias,M = standard deviation of the measurement distribution.NOTE 1: The quantity M includes the effects of the change in bias over the time interval in which M has been established.A1-4.4 Calculate and as follows. Note that the symbols in the equations for and have the followingmeanings:f(x) = PDF of process characteristic x,USL = upper specification limit,LSL = lower specification limit, and(u) = Gaussian CDF (see Equation (1) in A1-4.3).A1-4.4.1 For a characteristic with only a USL, use the following equations to calculate and: ( ) xxfxUSLUSLMd1  += (2) ( ) xxfxUSLUSL Md += (3) A1-4.4.2 For a characteristic with only an LSL, use the following equations to calculate and: ( ) xxfxLSLLSL Md += (4)"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 45 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E35-0305 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2005 14 ( ) xxfxLSLLSLMd1  += (5) A1-4.4.3 For a characteristic with both upper and lower specifications limits, use the following equations tocalculate and: ( ) ( )   ++ +=USLLSL M USLLSL MxxfxLSL xxfxUSL d d1 (6) ( ) ( ) xxfxLSLxUSL xxfxLSLxUSL USL MM LSLMMd d    + ++ + += (7) A1-5 Extensions of the Methodology to More Complex SituationsA1-5.1 In general, when a single characteristic on a unit is measured once on a single gauge and 100% sampling isemployed, the model will take the form described earlier. If the situation is more complex, the nature of the modelwill be different. Factors that can affect the nature of the model include the following: number of units examined (lot acceptance sampling vs. 100% sampling), number of times a unit is inspected (single vs. multiple), effect of the inspection process on the unit (destructive vs. non-destructive), number of item characteristics examined for a single decision (one vs. many), and cost functions associated with the business decisions (fixed vs. variable).A1-5.2 Extension to Multiple GaugesA1-5.2.1 To extend the model to multiple gauges, one must make the additional assumption that all measuringgauges are measuring the same characteristic.A1-5.2.1.1 In addition, define a conforming item as one that all gauges show the measured characteristic to be inspecification.A1-5.2.1.2 A nonconforming item is taken to be one in which at least one gauge shows the measured characteristicto be outside of specification.A1-5.2.2 It is then possible to define a set of and error rates for each gauge. Let1,2, ,n be the valuesand1,2 , ,n be the values associated with the n different gauges.A1-5.2.3 The overall value,T, is calculated from the equation: T = ( ) nii11 (9) where: ( ) xxfUSLd= , and f(x) = PDF of the characteristic being measured.NOTE 2: This equation is based on the probability P that the item is conforming but that one or more gauges give a conformingresult:T = P","[","Item is conforming, \u22651 gauges show nonconforming","]","= P","[","Item is conforming","]"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 46 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E35-0305 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 200515  P","[","Item is conforming, All gauges show conforming","]","A1-5.2.4 The overall value,T, is calculated from the equation: T = =nii1 (10) NOTE 3: This equation is based on the probability P that the item is nonconforming but that all gauges give a conforming result:T = P","[","Item is nonconforming, All gauges show pass","]","A1-5.3 Extension to Multiple Inspections with the Same Metrology SystemA1-5.3.1 Multiple inspection with the same metrology system is a special case of inspection with multiple gauges.If the same measurement system is used to measure the item characteristic repeatedly, one merely letsi = andi= for all i, as the and error rates will not change for the same gauge.A1-5.4 Extension to Decisions Based on Multiple CharacteristicsA1-5.4.1 It is also possible to develop a model where a decision is based on more than one characteristic. As withthe case of multiple gauges, several assumptions must be made.A1-5.4.1.1 The characteristics being measured are independent or an independent combination of their values isused.A1-5.4.1.2 All tests are performed before a decision to reject or pass is made.A1-5.4.1.3 F(x) has been deconvolved from FG.A1-5.4.1.4 A conforming unit is defined as one in which all measured characteristics are shown to be withinspecification.A1-5.4.1.5 A nonconforming unit is taken to be one in which at least one characteristic is outside of specification.A1-5.4.2 It is then possible to define a set of and errors for each gauge.
