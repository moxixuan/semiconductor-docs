13. 3  If  a  wafer  map  was  made,  report  the  following
information  in  addition  to  a  density  plot  of  the  carrier
recombination lifetime:
13. 3.1  Point spacing and pattern, and
13. 3.2  Radius of the mapped area.
13. 4  If   measurements   were   made   at   a   specific   or
several  temperatures,  report  the  temperature  of  each
measurement.
14  Precision and Bias
14. 1  Precision —  Neither  the  intralaboratory  nor  the
interlaboratory  precision  of  this  test  method  has  yet
been   established.      In   spite   of   this   limitation,   the
technique  is  widely  utilized  in  the  industry  without  the
benefit   of   standardization   of   the   test   conditions.
Because  of  the  lack  of  a  precision  determination,  this
test  method  should  be  used  for  materials  specification
and  acceptance  only  after  the  parties  to  the  test  have
established reproducibility and correlation.
14. 2  Bias —  No  information  can  be  presented  on  the
bias  of  this  test  method  because  no  material  having  an
accepted   reference   value   of   carrier   recombination
lifetime is available.

RELATED INFORMATION 1
INJECTION LEVEL CONSIDERATIONS
NOTICE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  MF1535.    It  was  derived  from
information  developed  during  the  original  preparation  of  the  standard  in  ASTM  Committee  F-1  in  1994.
This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures.
R1-1   The  carrier  recombination  lifetime  is  frequently
associated  with  the  minority  carrier  lifetime.    This
association  is  correct  only  if  the  lifetime  is  determined
for  low  injection  level  when
η  (the  ratio  of  density  of
excess   photogenerated   carriers   to   the   equilibrium
density  of  majority  carriers)  is  much  less  than  1,  and
then  only  if  certain  other  conditions  are  also  met  (see
Related   Information   2   and   Related   Information   3).
Nevertheless,  the  low-injection  (small-signal)  value  of
the carrier recombination lifetime is independent of the
exact value of
η provided that η << 1.  However, in this
test  method,  it  is  often  neither  possible  nor  convenient
to  make  measurements  in  the  low-injection  regime.
When  this  is  the  case,  the  measured  recombination
lifetime is a function of the injection level.
R1-2   The   basic   model   for   carrier   recombination
through    defect    centers    in    semiconductors    was
developed  independently  by  Hall
14
and  by  Shockley
and Read.
15
This model has been thoroughly discussed
by  Blakemore.
16
In  the  Shockley-Read-Hall  (S-R-H)
model,  it  is  assumed  (1)  that  the  doping  level  of  the
semiconductor  is  not  so  high  that  the  semiconductor
becomes  degenerate,  and  (2)  that  the  density  of  defect
centers  is  small  compared  with  the  majority  carrier
density.
NOTE 1:  The  reader  should  refer  to  Blakemore’s  text  for  a
more complete treatment than is presented here, including the
derivation   of   the   S-R-H   expression   (Equation   R1-1)   for
carrier  lifetime  and  discussion  of  the  effect  of  Fermi  energy
on   the   small-signal   recombination   lifetime.      In   addition,
Blakemore  goes  on  to  discuss  other  complexities  that  result
when the density of defect centers is not small compared with
the   majority   carrier   density,
17
and   when   carrier   trapping
occurs.
18

R1-3   Both   the   assumptions   underlying   the   S-R-H
model are generally appropriate for the specimens to be
measured by this test method.  With these assumptions,
the  density  of  excess  electrons  (n
e
)  is  equal  to  the
density  of  excess  holes  (p
e
),  and  the  electron  (τ
n
)  and
hole  (

useful for studying iron in p -type silicon because of the
facts that (1) it is possible to treat the sample to ensure
that  essentially  all  of  the  iron  is  in  either  the  elemental
or paired state,
19
and (2) the injection level dependence

may
represent  some  average  of  the  values  for  the  various
contaminants  because  this  technique  is  not  impurity
specific as is deep-level transient spectroscopy or other
spectroscopic techniques involving filling and emptying
of defect centers in the space-charge layer.

TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF CARRIER RECOMBINATION
LIFETIME
NOTICE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  MF1535.    It  was  derived  from
information  developed  during  the  original  preparation  of  the  standard  in  ASTM  Committee  F-1  in  1994.
This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures.
R2-1   The   temperature   dependence   of   the   carrier
recombination   lifetime   as   determined   under   low-
injection conditions has been proposed
4
as  a  means  for
identifying metallic impurities in silicon.  However, this
is  possible  only  for  low  injection  and  then  only  under
very restricted conditions.
R2-2   In  the  low-injection  limit,  the  (S-R-H)  carrier
recombination lifetime is given by Equation R1-2.  In a
nondegenerate  semiconductor,  the  carrier  densities,  n
0

p

R2-3   From  Equation  R1-2,  it  is  clear  that  the  low-
injection    (or    small-signal)    carrier    recombination
lifetime,
τ
0
,  can  be  calculated  readily  in  terms  of  the
electron and hole capture time constants,

In the temperature region between the freeze-out region
and  the  intrinsic  region  where  the  majority  carrier
density   is   equal   to   the   net   dopant   density,   the
denominator of these terms is constant.  If, in addition,
the  capture  time  constants  are  assumed  not  to  depend
on  temperature,  the  slope  of  the  ln
τ
0
versus  1/T  curve
yields the defect center energy,
ε
T
, in those temperature
regions where the defect centers are partially filled (that
is,  when  a  term  in
p
1
or  n
1
dominates  the  small-signal
recombination  lifetime).    Although  this  assumption  is
usually  not  rigorously  correct,  the  variation  of  capture
time  constant  with  temperature  is  usually  much  less
strong  than  the  exponential  dependence  of  the  carrier
densities.
R2-4   Three examples, elemental iron in both
n- and p-
type silicon and iron-boron pairs in
p-type silicon, serve
to illustrate these considerations.  In each case the iron
density  is  assumed  to  be  5  ×  10
11
atoms/cm
3
and  the
dopant density is assumed to be 1 × 10
15
atoms/cm
3
, for
p-type  silicon  this  dopant  density  corresponds  to  a
resistivity
ρ ≈  10–15  Ω·cm  and  for  n-type  silicon  it
corresponds   to   a   resistivity
ρ ≈   3–5   Ω·cm.      The
temperature  range  considered  is  from  250  to  1000  K
over  which  the  dopant  atoms  may  be  assumed  to  be
fully  ionized.    Elemental  iron  is  a  donor  center  which,
as  shown  in  Table  R1-1,  lies  well  above  the  valence
band  edge  in  the  bottom  half  of  the  forbidden  energy
gap.    The  iron-boron  pair  is  also  a  donor  center  but  it
lies   much   closer   to   the   top   of   the   valence   band.
Consequently,  in  each  case
p
1
>>  n
1
,  the  difference
being greater for the iron-boron pair.

However, because there is not much difference between

that of the

In  this  case,  there  is  even  less  difference  between  the

dominated by a single term, and thus the energy of the

comparable    with
n

material,  no  single  term  dominates  the  expression  and
so the slopes have no physical meaning.

impurities.

MINORITY-CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME
NOTICE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  MF1535.    It  was  derived  from
information  developed  during  the  original  preparation  of  the  standard  in  ASTM  Committee  F-1  in  1994.
This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures.
R3-1   The  recombination  of  an  excess  electron-hole
pair at a defect center is a two-step process.  It involves
either (
a) the capture of an electron in an empty defect
center  followed  by  the  capture  of  a  hole  or  (
b)  the
capture  of  a  hole  on  a  filled  defect  center  followed  by
the  capture  of  an  electron.    Thus,  the  recombination
time  depends  on  the  number  of  filled  or  empty  defect
centers as well as the capture time constants.
R3-2   The occupancy of the defect centres is controlled
by  the  position  of  the  Fermi  energy  as  discussed  by
Blakemore.
16
If all of the defect centers are empty, the
electron recombination time is governed by the electron
capture  time  constant,
τ
n0
;  this  occurs  when  the  Fermi
energy is well below the defect center energy.  If all of
the  defect  centers  are  filled,  the  hole  recombination
time is governed by the hole capture time constant,
τ
p0
;
this  occurs  when  the  Fermi  energy  is  well  above  the
defect energy.  Since the position of the Fermi energy is
governed    primarily    by    the    dopant    density,    the
occupancy  of  the  defect  centers  may  be  different  for
different resistivity wafers.
R3-3   There  are  two  sets  of  equivalent  cases.    The
defect  center  may  be  in  the  same  half  of  the  forbidden
gap  as  the  Fermi  energy  or  it  may  be  in  the  other  half.
Thus, the case for the defect center in the lower half of
the gap of a
p-type semiconductor is the same as for the
defect  center  in  the  upper  half  of  the  gap  in  an
n-type
semiconductor  with  the  roles  of  electrons  and  holes
interchanged.    Similarly,  the  case  for  the  defect  center
in the upper half of the gap in a
p-type semiconductor is
the same as for the defect center in the lower half of the
gap in an
n-type semiconductor.
R3-4   As   examples,   consider   the   three   cases   of
elemental  iron  in  both
n-  and  p-type  silicon  and  iron-
boron  pairs  in
p-type  silicon  at  room  temperature  (300
K).    In  each  case  the  iron  density  is  assumed  to  be
5 × 10
11
atoms/cm
3
.  Note that at for very low resistivity
wafers,  the  nondegeneracy  requirement  of  the  S-R-H
model may be violated.

Elemental  Iron  in  p-Type  Silicon  (see  Figure
R3-1)  —  For  all  practical  values  of  resistivity,  the
Fermi  energy  lies  many
kT  below  the  near  mid-gap
energy of the elemental iron center.  Consequently, the
defect  centers  are  empty  and  the  limiting  process  is
capture of excess minority electrons, there being ample
numbers of holes present to recombine with the electron
immediately  upon  its  capture  by  the  defect  center.
Therefore,    the    small-signal    carrier    recombination
lifetime   is   equal   to   the   electron   (minority-carrier)
capture time constant:
τ
0
= τ
n0
.
R3-4.2
Elemental  Iron  in  n-type  Silicon  (see  Figure
R3-2)  —  In  this  case,  for  all  values  of  resistivity,  the
Fermi energy is very far above the defect center energy
and all the defect centers are filled, and hole capture is
governed   by   the   hole   capture   time   constant,
τ
p0
.
Because  the  Fermi  energy  is  close  to  the  conduction
band edge, there are large numbers of electrons present
so that as soon as a hole is captured, the defect center is
filled  again.    Therefore,  hole  capture  is  the  limiting
process,   and   the   small-signal   carrier   recombination
lifetime  is  equal  to  the  hole  (minority-carrier)  capture
time constant:
τ
0
= τ
p0
.
R3-4.3
Iron-Boron  Pairs  in  p-Type  (Boron-Doped)
Silicon
(see  Figure  R3-3)  —  This  defect  center  is
located quite close to the valence band edge.  For all but
very low resistivity wafers, the Fermi energy lies above
the  defect  center  energy  so  that  some  of  the  defect
centers  are  filled.    In  this  case,  the  capture  of  minority
electrons  is  still  the  limiting  process,  but  since  only  a
fraction  of  the  sites  can  capture  an  electron,  the  small-
signal recombination lifetime is larger than the electron
capture time constant.  Quantitatively, because
n
0
<< p
0
,
the  small-signal  carrier  recombination  lifetime  is  given
by
τ
0
= τ
n0
(p
1
/p
0
).
R3-4.4    The  fourth  possible  case  is  one  in  which  the
defect  center  is  located  near  valence  band  edge  in
n-
type  material.    The  iron-boron  pair,  of  course,  cannot
exist  in
n-type  material;  however,  for  the  case  of  a
hypothetical defect center with energy near the valence
band  in
n-type  material,  τ
n0
p
1
>>  τ
p0
n
0
for  all  but  the
most heavily doped material so this term dominates the
small-signal lifetime and the minority-carrier properties
do not influence the recombination process.
R3-5   Thus,  for  deep  lying  defect  centers,  the  low-
injection (small-signal) carrier recombination lifetime is
equal  to  the  minority-carrier  capture  time  constant  (or
minority-carrier lifetime), while for centers close to the
band   edge,   the   small-signal   carrier   recombination
lifetime  can  be  much  larger  than  the  minority-carrier
capture time constant.

GUIDE FOR GENERATION OF CONSENSUS REFERENCE MATERIALS
FOR SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY
This guide was technically approved by the global Silicon Wafer Committee.  This edition was approved for
publication  by  the  global  Audits  and  Reviews  Subcommittee  on  April  7,  2005.    It  was  available  at
www.semi.org  in  June  2005  and  on  CD-ROM  in  July  2005.    Original  edition  published  by  ASTM
International as ASTM F 1569-94.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1569-94 (Reapproved 1999).
1  Purpose
1. 1  This  guide  covers  the  procedures  for  producing  a  single  set  of  consensus  reference  materials  (ConRefs)  in  the
absence of suitable certified reference materials from an established source.
1. 2  Such  reference  materials  are  frequently  required  for  calibration  of  measurement  systems  to  reduce  bias
differences between different organizations.
1. 3  The generated ConRefs can be used by a single laboratory for internal use or for interlaboratory comparison of
related equipment and materials.
1. 4  Most  often,  however,  they  are  used  for  replicating  multiple  sets  of  reference  materials.    In  such  a  case,  the
property  values  of  these  reference  materials  are  traceable  to  the  values  of  the  property  value  of  the  ConRefs.
Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  preparing  organization,  these  multiple  sets  may  be  certified  reference  materials  or
working reference materials.  For this purpose, a guide for generation of reference materials specific to the materials
and property may be required; Appendix 1 outlines the requirements for preparing a guide for generation of multiple
sets of reference materials.
2  Scope
2. 1  This guide covers the steps to be taken to generate a set of ConRefs for a specific property or family of related
properties required in semiconductor technology.
2. 2  The procedure for generating the set of ConRefs is based on interlaboratory testing in accordance with ASTM
Practice  E  691.    It  is  assumed  for  the  purposes  of  this  guide  that  the  test  method  evaluated  by  the  interlaboratory
study (ILS) is appropriate for determining the property values of the ConRef.
2. 3  This  guide  does  not  cover  the  selection  of  one  of  several  possible  test  methods  nor  does  it  cover  the  case  for
which other reference materials must be used in the measurement of the properties of the ConRef.
2. 4  This guide also describes procedures that may be used to generate consensus property values that may form the
basis for the generation of multiple sets of CRMs or reference materials (RMs).
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  guides  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.

Reference Material Hierarchy
4. 1.1  certified reference material (CRM) — a reference material one or more of whose property values are certified
by a technically valid procedure, accompanied by or traceable to a certificate or other documentation that is issued
by a certifying body (ISO Guide 30:1981).
4. 1.2  consensus  reference  material  (ConRef)  —  a  reference  material  one  or  more  of  whose  property  values  have
been established by a documented ILS that is based on a technically valid test method.
4. 1.3  reference  material  (RM)  —  a  material  or  substance  one  or  more  properties  of  which  are  sufficiently  well
established  to  be  used  for  the  calibration  of  an  apparatus,  (for)  the  assessment  of  a  measurement  method,  or  for
assigning values to materials (ISO Guide 30:1981; ISO 10012-1).
4. 1.3.1  Discussion  —  A  reference  material  made  by  a  laboratory  for  its  own  use  is  referred  to  as  a  working
reference material (WRM).  This term is gradually replacing the term, secondary reference material, which has been
used widely in the past.
4. 1.4  Standard Reference Material (SRM

) — a certified reference material issued by the U.S. National Institute of
Standards and Technology.
4. 1.5  traceability — the ability to trace the history, application, or location of an item or activity, or similar items or
activities, by means of recorded identification (ISO 8402).
4. 1.5.1  Discussion  —  ISO  8402  states  that  in  a  calibration  sense,  traceability  relates  measuring  equipment  to
national or international standards, primary standards, or basic physical constants or properties.  In this guide, as in

NOTE 2:  See Figure 2 for a flow chart of the steps covered.

Figure 2
Flow Chart for Generation of Consensus Reference Materials and Derived Sets of Reference Materials
5. 1  The  test  method  to  be  used  is  selected  or  developed,  and  acceptable  levels  of  repeatability  and  reproducibility
are defined.
5. 2  An  ILS  test  protocol  for  use  with  the  selected  consensus  test  method  is  developed  in  accordance  with  ASTM
Practice E 691 and the proper materials and instrumentation are assembled.
5. 3  The ILS is executed and analyzed.
5. 4  The results are evaluated against the criteria selected in ¶5.1.  If the results are acceptable, a precision statement
is developed and balloted for inclusion in the test method.  If the results are not acceptable, the test method validity
and the usefulness of the materials tested are assessed.
5. 5  The results are incorporated into a research report.
5. 6  If the results are acceptable, the materials used in the test are now qualified as ConRefs.  They have values of
the desired property (or properties) that represent the consensus of the industry; the uncertainty in these values can
be  estimated  from  the  repeatability  and  reproducibility  obtained  in  the  test,  as  documented  in  the  research  report.
These materials are stored in a location accessible for future use in preparing replicate sets of reference materials.
6  Procedure
6. 1  Select  or  establish  the  test  method  to  be  used  and  define  acceptable  levels  of  repeatability  and  reproducibility
for the proposed test method.
6. 1.1  If the test method has already been evaluated by an interlaboratory study (ILS) and contains repeatability and
reproducibility results documented in a research report or in the method itself, proceed directly to ¶6.4.  Otherwise
develop the test method as follows:
6. 1.1.1  Determine feasibility of proposed test method.
6. 1.1.2  Conduct screening experiments (ruggedness tests) of the proposed test method in a single laboratory.

6. 1.1.3  Draft test method.
6. 1.1.4  Obtain consensus within a representative task group or subcommittee.
6. 2  Design and initiate the Interlaboratory Study (ILS).
6. 2.1  Design  the  experiment  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of  ASTM  Practice  E  691,  taking  into  account
whether the test is destructive or nondestructive.
6. 2.2  Prepare  an  interlaboratory  test  protocol  that  specializes  the  test  method  to  this  design  and  also  includes  a
provision for reporting deviations from the method if participants in the interlaboratory test are unable to follow the
test method exactly.
6. 2.3  Select,  qualify,  and  prepare  materials  for  the  interlaboratory  test,  paying  particular  attention  to  issues  of
uniformity, stability, storage, transportation, and handling.
6. 2.4  Qualify instrumentation in accordance with test method and applicable quality control practices.
6. 2.5  Select and qualify participating laboratories.
6. 3  Execute the interlaboratory experiment.
6. 3.1  Collect the data in a round-robin or hub-and-spoke mode.
6. 3.2  Analyze the data collected in accordance with Practice E 691 to establish the repeatability and reproducibility
of the test.
6. 3.3  Derive an appropriate “uncertainty” from the results of the analysis and incorporate the repeatability and
reproducibility into “Precision” and “Bias” sections for the test method.
6. 4  Evaluate test results against the preselected criteria (see ¶6.1).
6. 4.1  If the result is acceptable, proceed to ¶6.5.
6. 4.2  If  the  result  is  not  acceptable,  assess  the  validity  of  the  test  method  and  the  usefulness  of  the  generated
materials.  Consider whether the test method may need to be revised or the ILS repeated with improved controls on
the procedures used.

TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING SURFACE SODIUM, ALUMINUM,
POTASSIUM, AND IRON ON SILICON AND EPI SUBSTRATES BY
SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY
This  test  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the   North   American   Regional   Standards   Committee   on   December   4,   2003.      Initially   available   at
www.semi.org February 2004; to be published March 2004.  Originally published by ASTM International as
ASTM F 1617-95.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1617-98 (Reapproved 2002).
1  Purpose
1. 1      Secondary   ion   mass   spectrometry   (SIMS)   can
measure    on    polished    silicon    wafer    product    the
following:
(1) the  sodium  and  potassium  areal  densities  that
can  affect  voltage  flatband  shifts  in  integrated  circuits,
and,
(2) the  aluminum  areal  density  that  can  affect  the
thermal oxide growth rate.
(3) the  iron  areal  density  that  can  affect  gate  oxide
integrity, minority carrier lifetime, and current leakage.
1. 2    The  SIMS  measurement  facilitates  the  production
of  silicon  wafers  with  upper  control  limits  on  sodium,
potassium, aluminum, and iron areal densities.
1. 3    This  test  method  can  be  used  for  monitoring  a
mirror-polished  wafer  cleaning  process,  for  research
and    development,    and    for    materials    acceptance
purposes.
1. 4    This  test  method  can  provide  spatial  information
for   these   metal   contaminants,   including   near-edge
substrate contamination levels.
1. 5        This    test    method    is    especially    useful    for
determining  the  surface  metal  areal  densities  in  the
native  oxide  or  chemically  grown  oxide  of  polished
silicon substrates after cleaning.
2  Scope
2. 1    This  test  method  covers  the  determination  of  total
sodium,  aluminum,  potassium,  and  iron  on  the  surface
of  mirror-polished  single  crystal  silicon  and  silicon  epi
substrates  using  SIMS.    This  test  method  measures  the
total amount of each metal, because this test method is
independent   of   the   metal's   chemistry   or   electrical
activity.
2. 2    This  test  method  can  be  used  for  silicon  with  all
dopant species and dopant concentrations.
2. 3    This  test  method  is  especially  designed  to  be  used
for  surface  metal  contamination  that  is  located  within
approximately 5 nm of the surface of the wafer.
2. 4    This  test  method  is  useful  for  sodium,  aluminum,
potassium,  and  iron  areal  densities  between  10
9
and
10
14
atoms/cm
2
.  The limit of detection is determined by
either  the  BLANK  value  or  by  count  rate  limitations,
and may vary with instrumentation.
2. 5  This test method is complementary to:
2. 5.1    Total  reflection  X-ray  fluorescence  (TXRF),  that
can detect higher atomic number Z, surface metals such
as  iron,  but  does  not  have  useful  (<10
11
atoms/cm
2
)
detection  limits  for  sodium,  potassium,  and  aluminum
on silicon.
2. 5.2    Vapor  phase  decomposition  (VPD)  of  surface
metals   followed   by   atomic   absorption   spectroscopy
(AAS)     or     inductively     coupled     plasma     mass
spectrometry  (ICP-MS)  of  the  VPD  residue,  where  the
metal detection limits are 10
8
to 10
10
atoms/cm
2
.  There
is   no   spatial   information   available   and   the   VPD
preconcentration   of   metals   is   dependent   upon   the
chemistry of each metal.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  Surface metal contamination of sodium, aluminum,
potassium or iron introduced during handling of the test
specimen or during the measurement itself introduces a
bias    to    the    measurement.        (Particulate    room
contamination    containing    these    metals    is    easily
distinguished from metal contamination by the shape of
the  SIMS  profile  that  should  have  the  log  of  the  signal
drop  linearly  with  time.    A  particulate  contamination
does not follow this shape under SIMS profile.)
3. 1.1      The   discrimination   of   elemental   ions   from
molecular  ions  is  particularly  important  for  the
27
Al
+

signal  that  has  a  significant  interference  below  about
10
11
to    10
12
atoms/cm
2
from    ubiquitous    C
2
H
3
+

molecular  ions  that  may  arise  from  clean  room  air  or


SEMI MF1617-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 2
from    plastic    cassette    containers.        The    relative
importance  of  the  organic  interference  is  dependent
upon the surface organics of the test wafer.
3. 1.2      Another   significant   interference   occurs   from
ubiquitous  BO
+
when  the  aluminum  is  in  the  range  of
10
9
to  10
10
atoms/cm
2
,  since  surface  boron  at  the  10
12

atoms/cm
2
range is common for all wafers, both n-type
as well as p-type.

3. 1.3    If  the  surface  contains  high  levels  of  sodium,
there  may  be  a  NaO
+
molecular  interference  for
39
K
+
.
In  principle,
11
B
12
C
+
and
11
B
28
Si
+
can  be  a  molecular
interferences for
23
Na
+
and
39
K respectively.
3. 1.4  The
54
Fe
+1
signal  can  have  interferences  from
27
Al
2
+1
or
54
Cr
+1
.
3. 1.5  Discrimination of molecular ion interferences can
be    achieved    using    magnetic    mass    spectrometers
operated  under  high  mass  resolution  or  in  some  cases
using   quadrupole   mass   spectrometers   via   energy
filters.
2

3. 2      Bias   in   the   relative   sensitivity   factors   (RSFs)
derived from reference materials can introduce bias into
the SIMS measured areal densities.
3. 3      Mass   interferences   can   introduce   bias   if   the
instrument  mass  resolution,  or  subsequent  detection
scheme, is not sufficient to exclude the interference.
3. 4    The  SIMS  sodium,  aluminum,  potassium,  and  iron
instrumental backgrounds can limit the detection of low
levels of surface metals.
3. 5  The accuracy and precision of the measurement can
be  significantly  degraded  by  analysis  of  specimens
whose  surfaces  are  not  all  at  the  same  inclination  with
respect   to   the   ion   collection   optics   of   the   SIMS
instrument.    The  specimen  holder  must  be  constructed
and  maintained  such  that  after  specimen(s)  are  loaded
into  the  holder,  the  inclination  of  the  surface  of  each
specimen is constant from specimen to specimen.
3. 6    The  accuracy  and  precision  of  the  measurement
significantly  degrade  as  the  roughness  of  the  specimen
surface  increases.    This  degradation  can  be  avoided  by
using chem-mechanical polished surfaces.
3. 7    If  an  oxygen  leak  is  not  used  in  conjunction  with
the measurement, there may be a bias due to the effect

5  Terminology
5. 1    All  terms  in  this  test  method  are  in  conformance
with those given in ASTM Terminology E 673.
6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1  Specimens of mirror-polished single crystal silicon
are   loaded   into   a   sample   holder.      The   holder   is
transferred  into  the  analysis  chamber  of  the  SIMS
instrument.
6. 2    A  primary  ion  beam,  typically  O
2
+
,  is  used  to
bombard  each  specimen  with  a  sputter  rate  less  than
0. 015 nm/s (0.9 nm/min).
6. 3    The  area  of  analysis  may  be  different  for  different
instruments and may range from 100 μm × 100 μm to 1
mm × 1 mm.
6. 4      Depending   upon   instrumentation,   a   molecular
oxygen jet or leak may be focused on the analysis area.
6. 5    The  positive  secondary  ions
23
Na,
27
Al,
39
K,  and
54
Fe  are  mass  analyzed  by  a  mass  spectrometer,  and
detected  by  an  electron  multiplier  (EM)  or  equivalent
high-sensitivity  ion  detector  as  a  function  of  time  until
the signals reach background levels or 1% of the initial
signal rates of each element.  The instrumentation must
be  able  to  discriminate  the  elemental  ion  signals  from
molecular interferences.
6. 6      A   BLANK   silicon   sample   is   used   to   evaluate
whether   the   lower   limit   of   detection   arises   from
molecular   ion   interferences,   elemental   instrumental
backgrounds,  or  count  rate  limitations.    The  matrix
positive  secondary  ion  count  rate  for  silicon  (

29
Si,
or
30
Si)   is   measured   by   a   faraday   cup   (FC)   or
appropriate detector during, or at the end of, the profile.
If   multiple   detectors   are   used   during   the   test,   the
relative  sensitivities  of  the  detectors  are  determined  by
measuring standard ion signals (either the same positive

7  Apparatus
7. 1  SIMS  Instrument  —  Equipped  with  a  primary  ion
beam,  preferably  O
2
+
,  a  mass  spectrometer  with  some
method  of  discriminating  molecular  ion  interferences
from  elemental  ions  of  interest,  an  electron  multiplier
detector,  or  faraday  cup  detector,  or  similar  detector
system capable of measuring secondary ion count rates,
or  any  combination  thereof,  and  the  ability  to  sputter
the  surface  at  less  than  0.015  nm/s.    An  molecular
oxygen  jet  may  be  used  to  stabilize  the  surface  ion
yield; the local oxygen gas flux to the specimen surface
must be stable enough that the secondary ion yield does
not  vary  during  the  analysis.    The  stability  of  the
oxygen  jet  effect  can  be  checked  by  monitoring  a
silicon  matrix  signal  during  a  profile;  and  if  the  matrix
signal  is  not  monitored  during  a  profile,  the  vacuum
chamber  pressure  can  be  monitored  for  fluctuations  in
the oxygen gas pressure.  The SIMS instrument should
be adequately prepared and maintained so as to provide
the lowest possible instrumental backgrounds.
7. 2  Test  Specimen  Holder  —  Reserved  for  the  SIMS
measurement.    In  some  instruments  the  holder  can
support  multiple  5  by  5-mm  samples  that  are  held  face
down  against  metal  (tantalum)  windows.    In  other
instruments  the  holder  can  support  one  or  more  15  by
15-mm  samples  by  spring  clips  on  the  edge  of  the
specimen  or  silver  paste  on  the  sample  back  surface.
Some  instruments  can  hold  full  silicon  wafers.    In  all
cases, the sample holder should be adequately prepared
and  maintained  so  as  to  provide  the  lowest  possible
contribution to instrumental backgrounds.
7. 3  Stylus  Profilometer  —  Or  equivalent  device  (for
example,  atomic  force  microscope)  to  measure  SIMS
crater depths.  This is required to calibrate depth scales
for   concentration   profiles   of   calibration   standard
samples.    For  routine  depth  scale  calibration  of  test
specimens,  the  instrument  must  be  capable  of  crater
depth  measurements  of  10  nm  with  an  accuracy  and
precision of 10%.  In the absence of such an instrument,
a secondary depth calibration standard (such as a silicon
wafer  with  a  known  impurity  depth  profile)  must  be
prepared  and  can  be  used  to  measure  the  SIMS  sputter
rate during the measurement.
NOTE  1:    The  accurate  measurement  of  sputter  crater  depths
on  the  order  of  and  below  10  nm  is  still  an  area  of  research,
because the sputtered silicon is very reactive to oxygen in the
air  when  removed  from  the  SIMS  chamber  for  crater  depth
measurement.    For  example,  sputter  craters  expected  to  be
only  1  nm  in  depth  can  actually  be  thicker  than  the  original
native  oxide  due  to  this  rapid  oxide  growth  on  sputtered
silicon, that is, one observes a bump on the surface where the
erosion  was,  rather  than  a  crater.    If  a  reference  sample  is
similar  to  the  unknown  in  type,  that  is,  intentional  surface
contamination  rather  than  shallow  ion  implant,  it  may  be
possible  to  avoid  the  need  for  a  direct  shallow  crater  depth
measurement on each sample.
8  Sampling
8. 1    Since  this  procedure  is  destructive  in  nature,  a
sampling   procedure   must   be   used   to   evaluate   the
characteristics of a group of silicon wafers.  No general
sampling  procedure  is  included  as  part  of  this  test
method,  because  the  most  suitable  sampling  plan  will
vary     considerably     depending     upon     individual
conditions.  For referee purposes, a sampling plan shall
be agreed upon before conducting the test.  See ASTM
Practice E 122 for suggested choices of sampling plans.
9  Specimen Requirements
9. 1  Sample specimen surfaces must be flat and smooth
(see Sections 3.5 and 3.6).
9. 2    Sample  specimens  must  be  cleaved  or  diced  to  fit
within  the  sample  specimen  holder.    Specimens  need
not be all the same size, but typical specimen sizes are
approximately  square  with  one  side  of  dimension  5  to
15 mm.
9. 3  Prepare a BLANK specimen with a level of surface
metal  below  that  expected  to  be  detected  by  this  test
method,  and  which  has  surface  organics  of  a  level  and
type expected for the unknown specimens.
NOTE  2:    If  measurements  are  to  be  made  on  specimens
taken  soon  after  a  cleaning  process,  the  organics  on  the
surface from clean room air and cassette carriers are very low
and negligible.  However, if the specimens are stored for one
day  or  more,  the  level  of  organics  may  be  significant  for  a
molecular    ion    interference    in    the    measurement
5
;    this
interference must be removed by the detection scheme.
10  Calibration
10. 1    The  calibration  is  by  RSFs  which  are  determined
empirically from reference materials.

quantitative    measurement.        With    a    spin    coat
contaminated  reference  sample,  it  may  be  possible  to
avoid the need for the crater depth measurement and its
bias/variability.    For  this  reference  sample,  the  areal
density D to be used in Equation 1 (see Section 12.1) is
the    elemental    areal    density    determined    by    the
VPD/AAs   or   VPD/ICP-MS,   corrected   for   isotopic
abundance  since  the  SIMS  measurement  of  SI

is

non-uniformity  can  introduce  variability  or  bias  to  the
SIMS quantitative measurement.  With an SC-1 dipped
reference  sample,  it  may  be  possible  to  avoid  the  need
for     the     crater     depth     measurement     and     its
bias/variability.    For  this  reference  sample  the  areal
density D to be used in Equation 1 (see Section 12.1) is
the    elemental    areal    density    determined    by    the
VPD/AAS   or   VPD/ICP-MS,   corrected   for   isotopic

uniform,  since  spatial  non-uniformity  can  introduce
variability     or     bias     to     the     SIMS     quantitative
measurement.  It is necessary to demonstrate that RSFs
obtained   from   these   reference   materials   and   the
instrumentation     and     operation     used     for     the
measurement are consistent with RSFs from spin coated
reference samples.

11  Procedure
11. 1  Specimen Loading and SIMS Instrument Set-up
11. 1.1  Cleave or dice individual specimens (unknowns,
reference,  BLANK)  to  fit  within  the  sample  holder.
The reference sample must contain
23
Na,
27
Al,
39
K, and
56
Fe  (or
54
Fe)  or  there  must  be  multiple  reference
samples, each with one or more of these elements.  Do
this   preparation   in   such   a   way   as   to   minimize
contamination of the specimens with surface metals.
11. 1.2    Load  the  specimen(s)  into  the  SIMS  sample
holder.
11. 1.3      Transfer   the   loaded   holder   into   the   SIMS
instrument sample chamber.
11. 1.4    Turn  on  the  instrument  in  accordance  with  the
manufacturer's instructions.
11. 1.5        Set    the    appropriate    analytical    conditions
including    the    method    for    molecular    ion    mass
interference discrimination.
11. 1.5.1    Select  a  primary  ion  current,  primary  beam
raster  size,  and  secondary  spectrometer  transmission,
which  will  result  in  an  appropriate  sputter  rate  (less
than 0.015 nm/s).
11. 1.5.2    Select  the  secondary  spectrometer  conditions
so that the maximum secondary ion-count rates result in
dead time losses below 10%.
6

11. 1.6          Confirm     that     analytical     conditions     are
appropriate  to  the  measurement  goals  by  measurement
of known reference standard(s) and BLANK sample.
11. 1.6.1  Confirm that the analytical sputter rate is such
that  each  element  monitored  in  a  single  profile  is
sampled  at  a  frequency  greater  than  or  equal  to  once
every 0.2 nm of sputtered depth.
11. 1.6.2    If  an  oxygen  jet  is  used,  confirm  that  0-leak
pressure  is  suitable  by  measuring  a  matrix  ion  depth
profile  and  demonstrating  that  matrix  secondary  ion
yield is constant (within 20%) during the analysis of the
first  10  nm  of  a  specimen.    Perform  this  confirmation
measurement on a typical specimen at the same sputter
rate to be used for the measurement of the surface metal
impurities.  If the ion yield shows significant variation,
increase  the  0-leak  pressure  by  a  factor  of  2×  and
reconfirm stability.
11. 1.6.3  Depending upon the instrumentation used and
if  needed,  measure  the  detector  efficiency  ratio(s)  for
any   detectors   used   during   the   measurement   (for
example,  the  electron  multiplier  and  the  faraday  cup
detectors).    Make  this  measurement  by  intercomparing
standard   secondary   ion   signals   of   the   appropriate
intensity    (to    minimize    dead-time    losses).        The
secondary  ion  count  rates  used  here  may  be  different
for this measurement than for the analysis, and may be
generated  under  different  sputter  rate  conditions  than
the analysis.
11. 2  Analysis of Specimen
11. 2.1      Center   the   primary   ion   beam,   initialize   the
SIMS  instrument  control  software,  and  begin  a  SIMS
profile.    For  sodium,  aluminum,  potassium,  and  iron,
the secondary ion signals generated by sputtering these

contaminants from the free surface or native oxide layer
on  the  specimen  should  ordinarily  reach  a  maximum
within the first 1 nm of the depth profile, and decrease
monotonically  thereafter.    If  this  general  profile  shape
is  not  obtained,  repeat  the  measurement  on  a  fresh
surface of the specimen.
11. 2.2      When   the   impurity   signal   has   either:   (1)
decreased  to  at  least  <1%  of  the  maximum,  (2)  or
reached a constant background count rate, then measure
and  record  the  silicon  matrix  ion  count  rate  on  the
appropriate detector.
11. 2.3      Measure   the   sputter   rate   under   the   analysis
conditions.    This  can  be  done  by  measuring  the  SIMS
crater  depth  with  a  stylus  profilometer  or  equivalent
instrument   if   available,   and   combining   the   depth
measurement with the recorded time elapsed during the
sputter profile.  If the analytical craters are too shallow
to be measured by available instrumentation, the sputter
rate must be monitored during a measurement series by
repeated analysis of a previously characterized standard
sample.
11. 2.4  Measure the BLANK under the same analytical
conditions as the unknown specimens.

12. 1    The  RSF  for  an  element  in  a  matrix  can  be

12. 3  The conversion of data cycles or time into depth is
completed  by  measuring  the  crater  depth  and  the  total
time  (or  data  cycles)  of  the  sputtering  that  formed  the
crater.    The  depth  scale  is  assumed  to  be  linear  with
time or data cycles.

14. 1.1    SIMS  measurements  were  made  on  samples

Two SIMS instruments were used: a CAMECA IMS 3f

PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS
ON SILICON WAFERS
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  for  publication  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  16,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org
September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.    Original  edition  published  by  ASTM  International  as
ASTM F 1618-95.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1618-02.
1  Purpose
1. 1  The  fabrication  of  semiconductor,  dielectric,  and
metal  thin  films  is  a  critical  part  of  silicon  integrated
circuit  production.    The  variation  of  film  properties
across  the  surface  of  a  wafer  can  have  significant
impact on the further processing of the wafer and on the
ultimate  yield  of  acceptable  chips  from  the  wafer,  as
well as on their reliability.
1. 2  The   purpose   of   this   practice   is   to   promote
commonality  of  approach  to  the  analysis  of  uniformity
among  all  parties  needing  to  generate  or  assess  such
information,  including  manufacturers  of  the  basic  test
instrumentation to be used.
1. 3  This   practice   is   intended   for   process   control,
research   and   development,   and   process   equipment
evaluation  purposes.    It  is  intended  for  the  benefit  of
semiconductor   device   and   equipment   manufacturers
alike so that acquisition, reduction, and communication
of  thin  film  data  is  consistent  among  various  parties
who may need to concur on interpretation of the results
of a thin film fabrication-process step.
1. 4  Measurement of the uniformity of one or more thin
film   properties   such   as   thickness,   sheet   resistance,
reflectivity,  dielectric  constant  or  index  of  refraction
enables the monitoring of a critical aspect of the results
of  a  given  process  step.    This  information  can  be  used
to determine the behavior of individual process steps; it
can   be   used   with   similar   information   from   earlier
process steps to determine their interaction with respect
to  final  product  uniformity.    Also,  it  can  be  used  in
conjunction  with  historical  data  from  the  same  process
step   to   determine   loss   of   control   of   the   piece   of
equipment or the process cycle being used with respect
to   producing   product   having   a   required   level   of
uniformity.    Further,  it  can  be  used  to  determine  the
adequacy  of  new  or  modified  process  cycles,  materials
or   equipment   for   a   given   film   deposition   or   film
modification requirement.
1. 4.1  It  is  common  practice  to  monitor  the  value  of  a
simple  statistic,  such  as  the  standard  deviation,  that
results  from  layer  uniformity  measurement  data  and  to
compare the current value of the statistic with historical
values for the same layer formation process.  An
increase  of  the  current  value  over  historical  values  is
taken  as  an  indication  of  possible  deterioration  of  the
quality  of  the  layer  formation  process.    It  is  then
common  to  convert  the  data  into  a  contour  or  similar
map  of  uniformity  to  aid  in  diagnosing  changes  in  the
process  that  caused  the  increase  in  standard  deviation
(or  similar  statistic).    This  practice  does  not  treat  the
interpretation   of   the   statistic   resulting   from   data
analysis, nor does it give procedures for converting the
data to a uniformity map.
1. 5  The non-uniformities of a film property on a given
wafer  are  primarily  systematic,  not  random,  in  their
spatial  shape  or  distribution  and  arise  from  spatially
systematic   variations   in   such   process   variables   as
temperature,  gas  flow,  pressure,  or  electric  field.    As  a
result,  the  simple  statistic  standard  deviation  that  is
specified for analysis of data acquired with this practice
will not generally have the normal interpretation for the
standard   deviation   of   a   sample   from   a   random
population.    It  is  a  figure  of  merit  for  comparing  data
sets   of   a   similar   type,   but   it   cannot   be   used   for
computing confidence or tolerance intervals.
2  Scope
2. 1  This   practice   covers   a   set   of   site   distribution
patterns for measuring the uniformity of a property of a
thin   film   on   a   silicon   wafer,   as   well   as   simple
procedures  for  analyzing  and  reporting  the  results  of
those measurements.
2. 2  This  practice  is  intended  for  use  as  a  template  for
the   evaluation   of   the   uniformity   of   intrinsic   film
properties  such  as  thickness  or  composition,  and  also
film  functional  characteristics  such  as  sheet  resistance
and reflectivity.  The resulting information may be used
to assess the uniformity of the film itself or of the layer
formation   process.      This   practice   is   not   directly
applicable  to  evaluating  wafer-to-wafer  or  lot-to-lot
variations.
2. 3  This practice is intended for use with any thin film
or  layer  type,  or  formation  technique,  for  which  basic
measurement instrumentation and capability exists that,
is  appropriate  to  the  film  parameter  of  interest.    This
practice  is  intended  for  layer  growth  and  deposition
techniques  such  as  epitaxy,  implantation,  thermal  and


SEMI MF1618-1104 © SEMI 2004 2
chemical   vapor   deposition   (CVD)   oxidation,   and
metallization,  as  well  as  for  layer  modification  such  as
various means of layer etching.
2. 4  This  practice  is  intended  for  use  with  all  silicon
wafer  sizes  and  types  when  measuring  uniformity  of
film   properties   and   characteristics.      This   practice
describes  measurement  site  patterns  and  determination
of their spatial coordinates on the wafer, as well as the
statistics  to  be  used  when  reducing  the  measurement
data to determine uniformity.  For each of the sampling
plans, the exact number of measurement sites is chosen
based  on  the  size  of  the  wafer  being  used,  the  desired
spatial  resolution  of  the  measurement  instrument,  and
whether   maximal,   or   somewhat   lesser   information
density  is  desired.    However,  in  all  such  choices,  the
pattern  of  measurement  sites,  the  rules  for  selecting
their   coordinates   on   the   wafer,   and   the   statistical
calculations of the results should remain consistent with
the procedures of this practice.
2. 5  This  practice  can  be  used  with  any  measurement
method, procedure or instrumentation that can measure
the    needed    film    property    or    characteristic    with
sufficient  precision  and  spatial  resolution  to  reveal  the
needed  information  on  spatial  non-uniformity  of  the
film.    This  practice  does  not  itself  contain  details  on
performing any specific measurement.
2. 5.1  Not  all  types  of  measurements  that  may  need  to
be  used  for  evaluation  of  the  uniformity  of  a  thin  film
have   formal   procedural   standards.      SEMI   MF374,
SEMI  MF576,  SEMI  MF1392,  SEMI  MF1393,  and
SEMI MF1529 give details of measurement procedures
that may be applied to evaluating the uniformity of thin
film properties.
2. 5.2  This  practice  does  not  deal  with  acquisition  or
analysis  of  uniformity  data  where  it  is  desired  to  take
more  than  one  measurement  per  specified  spatial  cell
such   as   is   commonly   done   for   wafer   site   flatness
measurements.
2. 6  This practice makes no recommendations regarding
the   interpretation   of   the   statistics   that   result   from
analysis   of   the   data   acquired   with   regard   to   the
goodness or badness of given values of the test statistic,
nor does it make recommendations regarding decisions
about  the  process  cycle  or  equipment  used  to  produce
the thin film that was measured.
2. 7  The  principles  of  this  practice  may  be  adapted  to
determine    the    uniformity    of    bulk    silicon    wafer
properties   such   as   interstitial   oxygen   content   and
resistivity,  but  depending  on  the  desired  property  and
the  chosen  measurement  technique,  depth-dependent
variations may be misinterpreted as lateral variations.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  This  practice  is  written  for  evaluation  of  planar  or
blanket films, but it may be applied to patterned films if
the pattern size, shape, and distribution do not interfere
with the spatial resolution of the selected measurement
technique and the specified measurement site selection.
If either of these interferences occur, the user may adapt
the  principles  of  the  method  to  the  needed  application,
but the interpretation of the results may change.
3. 2  The  principles  of  this  practice  may  be  adapted  to
other  semiconductor  wafers,  such  as  gallium  arsenide,
but  particular  concerns  with  those  other  materials  may
not be addressed adequately in this practice.
3. 3  Uniformity  measurements  from  certain  types  of
measurements  may  be  misinterpreted  if  the  user  is  not
aware of the full nature of the basic measurement being
made.  For example, sheet resistance is a function both
of  the  inherent  resistivity  of  the  film  being  measured
and  of  its  thickness  value.    Non-uniformity  in  sheet
resistance values across the wafer may result from non-
uniformity in resistivity (layer composition or structure)
or  layer  thickness  (deposition  rate)  alone,  or  it  may
result from simultaneous variations of both parameters.
3. 4  Changes in test equipment performance, or changes
in   test   procedure   or   conditions   over   time   may
detrimentally  affect  the  ability  to  compare  test  results
from this practice over time for a given film property or
fabrication  step.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  user  to
ensure   that   the   measurement   system   and   process
remains   in   sufficient   control   to   allow   time-wise
comparison  of  uniformity  results,  if  such  comparisons
are needed.
3. 5  Sampling  area  or  sampling  spot-size  may  cause
misinterpretation   of   the   cause   of   thin   film   non-
uniformity  if  the  magnitude  of  the  non-uniformity  and
its spatial scale, or rate of variation is not well matched
to the sampling spot size and the selected distribution of
measurement  sites.    While  this  should  not  be  a  serious
concern for most modern film deposition processes, and
process equipments, which are operating in control, the
principles of this limitation are worth elaborating.
3. 5.1  If  the  sampling  area  or  the  spot  size  of  the  test
instrument is large compared to rates of film parameter
change (gradients) that are important to identify, it must
be recognized that such large sampling area instruments
generate  some  form  of  spatial  average  response  that


SEMI MF1618-1104 © SEMI 2004 3
may understate macroscopic film non-uniformity or fail
to  respond  to  microscopic  film  non-uniformities  or
both.
3. 5.2  If  the  sampling  area  or  spot  size  is  small,  it  is
generally   possible   to   quantify   the   full   scale   of
macroscopic  film  non-uniformities.    However,  should
spatial  fine-scale  systematic  film  variations  be  present,
they  may  affect  the  individual  measurements  in  an
inconsistent  manner  unless  the  measurement  sampling
plan  is  tailored  to  the  spatial  size  scale  of  the  fine
variations.    Such  tailoring  of  the  sampling  plan  is
generally  incompatible  with  the  requirements  of  this
practice.
3. 6  For    the    most    meaningful    interpretation    of
uniformity  data,  all  sampling  sites  should  represent
equal  wafer  areas,  and  the  available  area  of  the  wafer
should  be  fully  sampled.    The  existence  of  wafer  flats
causes   a   failure   of   the   first   requirement   with   all
concentric  circle  sampling  plans.    The  need  of  the
semiconductor  industry  to  establish  as  large  a  quality
area  as  possible  on  wafers  also  causes  a  failure  of  the
first  requirement  for  the  outermost  circle  of  concentric
circle  sampling  plans  because  of  the  need  to  measure
right  up  to  a  very  small  edge  exclusion  value.    The
second  requirement  is  not  met  near  the  perimeter  of
Cartesian sampling plans.
3. 7  Ideally,   measurements   would   be   made   at   the
specified sites in a random sequence so that instrument
drift or changes in other environmental parameters that
may  affect  measurement  results  would  have  a  random
correlation  with  measurement  positions.  It  is  normally
not  practical  to  acquire  data  in  this  fashion.  Therefore,
any  instrumental  or  environmental  change  that  may
occur  will  have  a  correlation  with  the  spatial  ordering
of  the  measurement  sequence.  While  such  changes  are
expected   to   have   about   the   same   effect   on   both
concentric    circle    and    Cartesian    sampling    plan
measurements, providing the number of data points are
about the same, they would nevertheless have different
effects  on  two-dimensional  contour  maps  that  resulted
from these two different types of sampling plans.
3. 8  Individual  test  instruments  and  test  methods  that
may be used to measure properties or characteristics of
thin  films  are  subject  to  various  interferences  that  may
affect  measurement  precision  consistency,  resolution,
and   accuracy.      These   may   include   such   things   as
sensitivity to stray illumination, rf-fields, and variations
in temperature.  It is the responsibility of the user of this
practice  to  consult  instrument  manuals  and  appropriate
test  methods  in  order  to  identify  and  control  potential
interferences with that instrument or method.
3. 8.1  It is also the responsibility of the user to devise a
test for the inherent precision of the measurement being
made  so  that  imprecision  in  the  measurement  is  not
misinterpreted as non-uniformity of the thin film being
evaluated   by   this   practice.      This   is   particularly
important  for  application  of  this  practice  to  evaluating
films from process steps that are capable of a very high
degree  of  uniformity,  for  example,  1%  across  a  wafer.
Such  tests  may  involve  using  known  uniform  or  non-
uniform  test  specimens  whose  spatial  pattern  of  non-
uniformity   has   been   found   to   be   very   stable   over
extended periods of time.

6  Summary of Practice
6. 1  Measurements are made at the sites specified in the
chosen     sampling     plan     using     the     appropriate
instrumentation  and  measurement  procedure  for  the
film  parameter  of  interest.    Measures  of  the  dispersion
of the values are obtained by simple statistics specified
for the sampling plans.
7  Apparatus
7. 1  Four-probe     Sheet     Resistance,     Eddy-current,
Mercury   Probe   CV,   Spectroscopic   Reflectometers,
Ellipsometers,         Interferometers,         and         Stylus
Profilometers — Typical apparatus chosen according to
the type of material parameter being monitored.  Others
may be chosen according to need.  The instrumentation
should include such features as temperature monitoring
and     control,     EMI     shielding,     shielding     from
illumination,  etc.  as  is  necessary  for  good  practice  of
that    type    of    measurement.        In    addition,    all
instrumentation must include the following:
7. 1.1  Ability  to  center  the  wafer  on  the  measurement
stage to an accuracy of 0.5 mm or better,
7. 1.2  Vacuum  chuck,  or  similar  fixture,  to  secure  the
wafer to the instrument stage during measurement,
7. 1.3  Ability    to    locate    the    measurement    points
specified in the chosen sampling plan to an accuracy of
0. 5 mm or better, and
7. 1.4  Ability  to  store  all  measurement  data  to  perform
the required calculation of uniformity.
7. 2  Capability of the instrumentation to perform one or
more  of  the  following  auxiliary  data  presentations  is
highly recommended:
7. 2.1  Generating a two-dimensional contour map of the
acquired data,
7. 2.2  Generating  a  histogram  of  the  raw  data  values,
and
7. 2.3  Presenting the raw data as a time-series plot.
7. 3  Capability  to  edit  data  and  to  blend  or  interpolate
data in conjunction with two-dimensional mapping may
be useful, but it should be done with caution.
8  Procedure
8. 1  Calibrate  the  measurement  system  in  accordance
with   the   manufacturer’s   instructions   or   with   the
applicable test method.
8. 2  Place  the  wafer  on  the  instrument  stage  so  as  to
locate  the  wafer  center  within  0.5  mm  of  the  center  of
the stage.  For the purposes of this procedure, the wafer
center is considered to be defined by the intersection of
any  two  diameters  that  do  not  intersect  a  wafer  flat  or
orientation notch.
8. 3  Select  the  sampling  plan  to  be  used  from  those
listed in Appendix 1 and proceed to take measurements
at  all  the  specified  locations.    It  may  be  necessary  to
enter  the  coordinates  of  the  desired  sampling  plan  into
instrument  software,  or  to  work  with  the  manufacturer
of the equipment to modify its software if the sampling
plans  available  in  the  instrument  do  not  match  the
requirements of Appendix 1.
8. 4  Take  measurements  at  all  locations  specified  for
the   selected   sampling   plan.      Then   quantify   the
uniformity from the acquired data using the calculations
specified in Section 9.

9. 2  Examine  the  data.    If  agreed  upon  between  parties
to the test, reject values that are away from the mean by
more than three times the standard deviation calculated
in  Section  9.1.    Recalculate  the  mean  and  standard
deviation using Equations 1 and 2, where N is now the
reduced number of data points.
NOTE 1:  It  is  generally  advisable,  through  use  of  a  time
series plot of the original data, or similar means, to inspect the
data   just   rejected   for   determination   of   measurement   site
location and relation to adjacent measurement values.
NOTE 2:  The   calculation   for   standard   deviation   may   be
made regardless of any systematic behavior of the underlying
distribution  of  measured  values.    However,  when  there  is  a
systematic   spatial   behavior   to   the   measured   values,   the
standard  deviation  may  not  be  used  to  estimate  confidence
intervals or tolerance limits.
9. 3  Calculate  the  following  two  statistics  from  the
complete data set or from the reduced data set if certain
measurements  were  rejected  in  Section  9.2.  These  two
statistics represent the range and the distribution of data
about the mean.  The use of only one of these statistics
is at the discretion of the interested parties.

APPENDIX 1
SAMPLING PLANS TO BE USED FOR WAFER UNIFORMITY
DETERMINATION
NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI MF1618 and was approved by full letter ballot
procedures.
A1-1 Introduction
A1-1.1 For  all  plans,  measurements  are  made  within  a
circular  area  defined  by  the  radius,  R
o
,  between  the
center  of  the  wafer  and  the  circle  on  which  the  centers
of the outermost measurement sites lie.  Determine this
radius by either of the following methods:
A1-1.1.1
Method  A  —  In  this  method,  the  outermost
edges of the measurement spots on the outermost radius
are  tangent  to  the  boundary  of  the  fixed  quality  area
(FQA) as defined in SEMI M1:

where:

D      =    nominal  diameter  of  the  wafer,  for  example,
100, 150, 200, or 300 mm,
EE     =    nominal      wafer      edge      exclusion,      which
determines the FQA, and
d          =          known     or     estimated     diameter     of     the
measurement  spot  for  the  test  instrument  being
used (Note 1).
NOTE 1:  The  exact  diameter  of  the  measurement  spot  may
not be known for many types of measurements.  Estimate the
diameter as 1.5 times the probe spacing for a four-point probe,
transducer radius for an eddy-current instrument, and apparent
beam   spot   radius   for   optical   measurements   if   no   other
information is available.
A1-1.1.2 Method B — In this method, the centers of the
measurement  spots  on  the  outermost  radius  are  on  the
boundary of the fixed quality area (FQA) as defined in

A1-2 Selection of Method
A1-2.1 Neither  of  these  methods  is  “better”  than  the
other; rather, there are tradeoffs.
A1-2.2
The  location  of  every  point  in  a  multipoint
measurement  pattern  depends  on  the  method  chosen  to
define the position of the outermost measurement sites.
Therefore,  there  may  be  differences  between  the  two
methods for reported individual and statistical values.
A1-2.3
Data for a measurement site are usually reported
at  the  location  corresponding  with  the  center  of  the
measurement spot.
A1-2.4
Data  from  each  measurement  on  the  outermost
ring in Method A are not affected by the film properties
in   the   edge   exclusion   annulus   outside   the   FQA.
However,   in   this   case,   data   are   not   reported   for
locations  closer  to  the  boundary  of  the  FQA  than  the
measurement spot radius.
A1-2.5
Conversely, data from each measurement on the
outermost  ring  with  Method  B  include  contributions
from  film  properties  both  inside  and  outside  the  FQA.
In this case, measurement data is reported for locations
up  to  the  boundary  of  the  FQA,  but  establishing  the
significance   of   including   data   influenced   by   film
properties  outside  the  FQA  is  outside  the  scope  of  this
practice.
NOTE 2:  Measurements   obtained   using   a   probe   whose
effective  measurement  area  extends  beyond  the  edge  of  the
film inaccurately represent actual film properties.

A1-3 Concentric Circle Plans
2

A1-3.1 The concentric circle plans are designed so that
each  measurement  location  samples  approximately  an
equal  area  of  the  specimen  surface.  Because  these  are
circular  plans  on  a  circular  wafer,  ideally  they  give
equal   representation   to   all   portions   of   the   wafer’s
surface.    This  approximation  to  equal-area  sampling
breaks  down  for  the  outermost  circle  if  the  size  of  the
edge  exclusion  is  less  then  half  the  radial  separation
between the inner circles for the spacing being used.  In
this   case,   the   measurements   on   the   outer   circle
represent   a   smaller   area   of   silicon   than   do   the
measurements  on  the  inner  circles.    Moreover,  if  the
actual  sampling  area  of  the  measurement  being  used  is
larger  than  the  value  estimated  in  Section  A1-1.1.1,
measurements  on  the  outer  circle  may  be  partially
influenced   by   thin   film   properties   in   the   excluded
region even though the resulting values are attributed to
the fixed quality area of the film.
A1-3.2
The  concentric  circle  sampling  plans  utilize  a
measurement   at   the   wafer   center   and   points   on   a
number of concentric circles designated 1, 2, 3, ... n, the
number of circles being chosen by the user according to
wafer   diameter,   estimated   sampling   area   for   the
measurement    being    made,    and    the    amount    of
information  desired  about  the  uniformity  of  the  thin
film.
A1-3.2.1
On    each    circle,    the    measurements    are
separated    by    equal    angular    intervals.        Eight
measurements are made on the first circle, 16 are made
on  the  second  circle,  etc.    In  general,  the  number  of
measurements is eight times the circle number.  For the
first  circle,  measurements  are  separated  by  rotations  of
45°,  for  the  second  circle,  by  22.5°,  and  so  forth,
regardless of the radial value of the measurement or the
wafer diameter.
A1-3.2.2
The radial values for the concentric circles are
determined  as  follows.    Inspect  Table  A1-1  for  the
number  of  total  measurements  that  are  made  as  a
function of the number of circles used and decide on the
number    of    circles    according    to    the    amount    of
information needed for the film uniformity and the time
required  for  the  test  instrument  to  take  that  many
measurements.    Call  the  chosen  number  of  circles,  N
C
.
Divide    the    value    of    the    outermost    radius,    R
o
,
determined  in  Section  A1-1.1,  by  N
C
.    This  gives  the
radial increment between the circles.  The center of the
measurement  tool  or  measurement  spot  is  to  be  placed
at  the  location  given  by  this  radial  increment  value.

circle and four-circle sampling plans.
NOTE 3:  If  the  incursion  of  the  orientation  flat(s)  precludes
taking  valid  measurements  near  the  flat  in  conjunction  with
the  chosen  edge  exclusion,  the  parties  to  the  test  may  choose
to   exclude   specified   measurement   locations   if   the   test
instrument permits or to replace specified sites with sites at a
distance  from  the  flat  that  is  equal  to  the  distance  specified
with respect to the circular perimeter of the wafer.  It must be
remembered,  however,  that  either  such  choice  may  have  an
adverse  impact  on  the  interpretation  of  any  two-dimensional
contour map.

A1-3.2.3 For   consistency,   place   the   wafer   on   the
instrument  stage  with  the  primary  flat,  or  notch,  facing
the operator.  If another convention becomes necessary,
so  note  it  on  the  report.    Measurements  are  made
starting  at  the  center  of  the  wafer  then  proceeding
around  the  first,  then  the  second,  then  the  third  circle,
and  so  forth.    For  all  circles,  make  sure  that  the  first
measurement  is  made  at  the  same  angular  orientation;
the  positive  x-axis  or  the  positive  y-axis,  as  defined  in
the wafer coordinate system specified in SEMI M20, is
recommended.    The  choice  should  have  no  bearing  on
the  data  or  its  analysis.    However,  if  data  is  to  be
presented  as  a  time-series  plot,  note  on  the  plot  the
position  of  the  first  point  on  each  circle  as  well  as
whether  the  measurements  proceed  in  a  clockwise  or
counterclockwise fashion on the wafer surface.

Calculate the uniformity based on the difference
between the maximum and minimum measured values,
HLV(%),  and  on  the  standard  deviation  as  a  percent  of
the  mean  of  all  measurements,  SUP(%)  as  detailed  in
Section 9.3.
A1-4 Cartesian Sampling Plans
A1-4.1 Cartesian  sampling  plans  sample  equal  areas  in
the  interior  of  the  wafer  surface,  but  fail  to  sample
portions of the wafer near its perimeter.  They may not
provide   sufficient   information   about   the   outermost
portion of the fixed quality area for a given application.
See  Figure  A1-3  for  an  illustration  in  the  case  of  a  37-
point Cartesian sampling plan.
A1-4.2
These  plans  have  a  grid  of  equal-sized  cells,
equally   spaced   about   the   center   of   the   wafer.      A
measurement  is  made  in  the  center  of  each  cell.    The
number of rows and columns in the grid, always an odd
number,   is   chosen   according   to   wafer   diameter,
estimated sampling area for the measurement being


SEMI MF1618-1104 © SEMI 2004 8

made, and the amount of information desired about the uniformity of the thin film.  The square cells in this plan are
not necessarily the shape or size of the sampling area for the measurement being used.  In general, make sure that
the sampling area for the measurement is smaller than the dimensions of the square.

A1-4.3 The  size  of  the  cells,  and  the  separation  of  the
measurement    sites    along    the    x-    and    y-axes,    is
determined  by  the  number  of  rows  and  columns  into
which the wafer surface is partitioned. Use Table A1-2
as  a  guide  to  the  approximate  number  of  measurement
sites for various numbers of rows and columns of cells.
To  calculate  the  dimensions  of  the  square  cells,  divide
the  outermost  radius,  R
o
,  determined  in  Section  A1.1,
by N,  the  desired  number  of  rows  and  columns.  The
exact number of sites that will be measured is governed
by  the  number  of  cells  near  the  wafer  perimeter  that
need to be excluded because the center of the cell, that
is,  the  center  of  the  measurement  spot,  does  not  fall
within the radius R
o
.
A1-4.4
Use  test  instrument  software  to  establish  the
coordinates of the center of all cells as determined from
the ratio R
o
/N
C
, calculated in Section A1-4.3.  Disallow
measurement  sites  near  the  wafer  perimeter  such  that
the  radial  distance  to  the  center  of  the  cell,  that  is,  the
center  of  the  measurement  spot,  is  larger  than  R
o
.  This
follows  the  same  rationale  for  allowed  measurement
sites as is used with the concentric circle plans.
A1-4.5
Take   measurements   at   all   sites   allowed   in
accordance   with   Table   A1-2.      The   measurement
sequence,  whether  starting  from  the  center  point  and
moving  outward  or  starting  from  one  edge  a  row  or
column at a time, is to be decided by the parties to the
test.
A1-4.6
Calculate the uniformity based on the difference
between the maximum and minimum measured values,
HLV(%),  and  on  the  standard  deviation  as  a  percent  of
the  mean  of  all  measurements,  SUP(%),  as  detailed  in
Section 9.3.
A1-5 Single-Diameter Sampling Plan
A1-5.1 This    plan    uses    a    very    high    density    of
measurements    along    a    diameter    and    includes    a
measurement   at   the   wafer   center.      It   is   shown
schematically  in  Figure  A1-4  for  the  diameter  being
parallel  to  a  major  wafer  flat.    However,  in  the  case  of
notched  wafers,  the  notch  would  replace  the  flat  in  the
figure.  It is also possible, by agreement of the parties to
the test, to make the measurements along a diameter at
a  specified  angle  with  respect  to  the  fiducial  axis  as
long as such an angle is then stated in the report.
A1-5.2
Choose   a   value,   N
M
,   for   the   number   of
measurements, where N
M
is at least 25.  The separation
between  measurement  sites  is  given  by  2R
o
/(N
M
−  1),
where R
o
is determined as in Section A1-1.1.

additional information may be obtained by choosing so
large a value for N
M
; it may be appropriate to reduce N
M

so that the new calculated site separation is equal to or
greater than the measurement sampling area.
A1-5.3
Establish  the  coordinates  for  all  measurement
sites using the site interval value just calculated and the
wafer    center    as    the    reference    point.        Take
measurements at all sites.
A1-5.4
Calculate the uniformity based on the difference
between the maximum and minimum measured values,

the  mean  of  all  measurements,  SUP(%),  as  detailed  in
Section 9.3.

TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OF
SINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES
This  test  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the North American Regional Standards Committee on March 14, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org

May 2004; to be published July 2004.  Original edition published by ASTM International as ASTM F 1630-

# 95

95.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1630-00.
1  Purpose
1. 1  Electronic  grade  polysilicon  producers  and  users
rely  on  LTFT-IR  spectroscopy  to  evaluate  polysilicon
for quality assurance and research purposes.
1. 2   LTFT-IR   spectroscopy   identifies   and   quantitates
boron,     phosphorus,     aluminum,     arsenic,     indium,
antimony, and gallium.
1. 3 LTFT-IR spectroscopy can be applied to FZ, CZ, or
other single crystal silicon (either doped or undoped) up
to the concentration limits given in Section 2.2.
1. 4   The   measurement   of   carbon   in   silicon   at   low
temperature   can   be   accomplished   concurrently   in
accordance  with  SEMI  MF1391.    The  carbon  can  be
measured  at  lower  concentrations  at  <15  K  than  is
possible  at  room  temperature  because  the  two-phonon
band  transmission  is  increased  by  a  factor  of  two
allowing  greater  throughput  to  the  detector  that  results
in  an  increased  signal  to  noise  ratio.    Also  the  carbon
adsorption band narrows from a FWHM of 5 to 6 cm
−1

to   a   FWHM   of   2.5   to   3.0   cm
−1
at   these   low
temperatures.
2  Scope
2. 1   This   test   method   covers   the   determination   of
electrically     active     boron,     phosphorus,     arsenic,
aluminum,   antimony,   and   gallium   concentration   in
single crystal silicon.
2. 2  This  test  method  can  be  used  for  silicon  in  which
the  impurity/dopant  concentrations  are  between  0.01
ppba  and  5.0  ppba  for  each  of  the  electrically  active
elements.
2. 3  The  concentration  for  each  impurity/dopant  can  be
obtained  by  application  of  Beer’s  Law.    Calibration
factors are given for each element.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  guides  and  determine  the
applicability  of  regulatory  or  other  limitations  prior  to
use.
3  Limitations
3. 1 The sample specimen must be colder than 15 K for
measurement   of   electrically   active   species.      If   the
sample specimen is mounted on a cold finger, care must
be  taken  to  obtain  good  contact  between  the  sample
specimen and the cold finger for efficient heat transfer.
The  oxygen  absorption  lines  at  1136  cm
−1
and  1128
cm
−1
are  sensitive  to  temperature  and  can  be  used  to
determine   the   specimen   temperature.
1
When   the
sample specimen is less than 15 K the net absorbance at
1136 cm
−1
is three times larger than the net absorbance
at  1128  cm
−1
.    A  ratio  of  greater  than  three  is  obtained
for temperatures below 15 K.
3. 2    Without    sufficient    incident    white    light    the
compensated  donors  and  acceptors  will  not  absorb.
Therefore,   the   white   light   intensity   must   be   great
enough  to  completely  neutralize  all  the  compensated
donors  and  acceptors.    The  intensity  of  the  white  light
necessary  must  be  determined  for  each  system.    The
user should increase the intensity of the white light until
further   increase   in   intensity   no   longer   affects   the
area/height  of  the  electrically  active  impurity/dopant
peaks.
3. 3    Water    vapor    absorption    interferes    with    the
measurement   of   several   peaks.      Consequently,   the
background spectrum should be collected at least daily.
The  entire  light  path,  including  the  sample  chamber,
must  be  purged  to  remove  moisture.    Special  care
should   be   taken   whenever   a   sample   specimen   is
changed   so   that   the   moisture   level   in   the   sample
chamber or elsewhere  in the light path is not affected.
3. 4  Oxygen  level  in  Czochralski  silicon  can  be  high
enough   to   exhibit   thermal   donor   absorption   lines.
These  lines  fall  between  400  cm
−1
and  550  cm
−1
and
can  interfere  with  aluminum  (473  cm
−1
),  gallium  (548
cm
−1
),  and  occasionally  arsenic  (382  cm
−1
).    Thermal
donors   can   be   removed   by   annealing   the   sample
specimen.

3. 5    Multiple    internal    reflections    can    produce    a
secondary   interferogram   and   baseline   oscillations.
Changing  the  sample  specimen  thickness,  the  surface
preparation,    or    the    resolution    can    eliminate    the
secondary interferogram and the baseline oscillation.

6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1   A   sample   specimen   of   single   crystal   silicon   is
cooled  to  less  than  15  K.    Under  these  conditions  the
number  of  free  carriers  becomes  negligibly  small  and
the  IR  spectrum  of  the  sample  exhibits  a  series  of
absorption bands that are characteristic for each shallow
impurity species.
4

6. 2   The   sample   specimen   is   illuminated   with   an
incident  white  light  source  to  flood  the  silicon  with
photons  of  greater  energy  than  the  silicon  band  gap  to
allow neutralization of compensated impurities.
5

6. 3  An  infrared  beam  is  directed  through  the  sample
specimen  and  a  transmitted  spectrum  is  collected.    The
spectrum  is  ratioed  to  the  background  spectrum  and
then converted to an absorbance spectrum.
6. 4 Baselines are constructed at one of the characteristic
absorption   bands   for   each   impurity/dopant   to   be
measured.

6. 6     Concentrations     of     each     impurity/dopant     are
calculated   in   accordance   with   Bouguer-Beer’s   Law
with factors given in this test method.
7  Apparatus and Materials
7. 1 Cryostat   —   To   maintain   the   sample   specimen
temperature  below  15  K.    This  cryostat  may  be  liquid
helium   immersion,   exchange   gas,   or   closed   cycle
refrigeration.
7. 2 Sample  Specimen  Holder  —  Constructed  of  high
heat conductivity metal with an aperture(s) to block any
of  the  infrared  beam  except  that  passing  through  the
sample.
NOTE   1:      The   procedure   of   Section   11   is   based   on   the
assumption  that  the  cryostat  can  accommodate  and  utilizes  a
multi-sample holder.
7. 3 White-light Source — As shown in Figure 1.

Sample Holder and Optics Suitable for Illumination
with White Light via Fiber Optics

7. 4 Fourier  Transform  Infrared  Spectrometer  (FT-IR)
—  Must  be  equipped  with  suitable  optics  and  detector
for use in the region from 250 cm
−1
to 1300  cm
−1
.
7. 4.1  The  spectrometer  shall  be  capable  of  at  least  1.0
cm
−1
resolution.    The  resolution  shall  be  sufficient  so
that    after    zero-filling,    apodization,    and    Fourier
transformation the phosphorus adsorption band at 315.9
cm
−1
has a FWHM not to exceed 1.1 cm
−1
.
7. 4.2   The   detector   shall   be   sufficiently   sensitive   to
provide  a  reasonable  signal  to  noise  response  in  the
desired  spectral  region.    A  room  temperature  DTGS
with    a    CsI    window    suffices    for    the    higher
concentrations    of    elements    in    this    test    method.
However,   a   zinc-doped   germanium   Ge:Zn   detector
operated  at  4.4  to  10.0  K  is  preferred  to  give  a  signal-
to-noise   ratio   sufficient   to   properly   determine   the
elements  at  the  lower  concentrations  and  for  improved
precision.
7. 5 Calcium Fluoride Crystal (CaF
2
) — Cut to nominal
thickness of 5 mm.
8  Sample Preparation
8. 1  If  the  samples  are  from  polysilicon,  they  must  first
be converted to single crystal in accordance with SEMI
MF1723 or other established means.
8. 2 Sample specimen shall be cut and polished to fit the
sample   specimen   holder.      The   surface   may   be
mechanically  or  chemically  polished.    Each  sample
specimen  shall  have  a  thickness  variation  of  less  than
1% of overall thickness.
8. 3  For  measurement  of  electrically  active  impurities,
the sample specimen thickness should be as follows:
8. 3.1  For  high  purity  silicon  (>2000  Ω·cm): 3 to 5 mm
to allow for lower detection limits.
8. 3.2  Between  5  and  20  mm  in  cases  where  impurity
levels to be measured are below 0.01 ppba.
8. 3.3 For heavily doped silicon (<10 Ω·cm): 1 to 2 mm
to allow greater transmission of the infrared radiation.
9  Reference Specimens
9. 1 One or more silicon samples that contain impurities
in  the  range  of  the  samples  to  be  tested  shall  be
classified  as  reference  specimens.    These  reference
specimens    should    be    analyzed    repeatedly    and
periodically according to this test method. Compare the
results  obtained  to  previous  data  to  establish  that  the
measurement process is in control.
10  Testing of the Instrument
10. 1  Establish  FT-IR  instrument  stability  by  checking
the 100% transmittance line.
10. 1.1    Collect    and    store    two    background    spectra
sequentially  through  an  open  aperture  of  the  cryostat
specimen holder.
10. 1.2    Ratio    these    two    spectrum    to    obtain    a
transmittance spectrum.
10. 1.3 Examine  the spectrum  from  1200  cm
−1
to  250
cm
−1
.    The  spectrum  should  be  100  ±  0.5%  T over this
range.  Proceed  only  if  the  spectrum  is  100  ±  5%  over
this    range,    otherwise    correct    any    instrumental
instability.

10. 2 Check for detector linearity.

10. 2.1 Examine one of the two single-beam (unratioed)
spectra obtained in Section 10.1.1 for nonzero response
at  wavenumbers    where  the  detector  is  known  to  have
zero  response  (below  200  cm
−1
for  the  zinc  doped
germanium detector with a CsI window).  The observed
response  in  this  region  should  be  less  than  1.0%  of  the
maximum  response  over  the  1200  to  250  cm
−1
region.
If not, take corrective action before proceeding.
10. 2.2 Alternatively,  collect  a  spectrum  with  a  CaF
2

crystal  wafer,  5  mm-thick,  in  the  IR  beam.    Ratio  this
spectrum  relative  to  one  of  the  background  spectrum
obtained  in  Section  10.1.1  to  obtain  a  transmittance
spectrum.  CaF
2
is totally opaque below 800 cm
−1
.  The
spectrum must give 0.0 ± 0.5% transmittance from 800
to  250  cm
−1
.    If  not,  take  corrective  action  before
proceeding.
11  Procedure
11. 1 Measure the thicknesses to ±0.02 mm and load all
the  sample  specimens  to  be  examined  onto  the  sample
specimen holder leaving at least one open slot.  Include
a reference specimen to serve as an audit to ensure that
the entire instrument is performing correctly.
11. 2 Mount them in the cryostat and cool the samples to
less than 15 K.
11. 3 Set instrumental parameters to give a resolution of
1. 0 cm
−1
or better.
11. 4 Select the reference specimen as the first sample to
be measured.
11. 5  Collect  1000  scans  of  an  empty  sample  chamber
slot and use this as the background spectrum.
11. 6 Move the sample specimen into position.
11. 7 Turn on the incident white-light source and ensure
that the sample specimen is fully illuminated with white
light  and  properly  aligned  relative  to  the  IR  beam  (see
Figure 1).
11. 8 Collect a minimum of 300 scans of the sample.
11. 9 Zero-fill, apodize, and transform the interferogram
into  a  spectrum  and  then  ratio  it  to  the  background
spectrum.
11. 10 Covert to an absorbance spectrum and use as the
sample specimen spectrum.

Spectroscopy 38(4), 491–494 (1984).
11. 11   Store   this   spectrum   and   subsequent   ones   for
further   manipulation   and   measurement   of   the   peak
areas.
11. 12 Repeat  Sections  11.5  through  11.11  for  each
sample specimen.
12  Data Reduction
12. 1  This  test  procedure  requires  the  measurement  of
the  areas  of  the  absorption  bands  before  calculation  of
the  concentration  of  each  element.    The  absorption
bands   are   very   sharp,   especially   for   the   Group   V
elements,  and  therefore  peak  height  measurements  are
difficult  to  reproduce  from  instrument  to  instrument.
Use of peak areas greatly reduces this variability.
12. 1.1    Establish    baselines    for    each    peak    before
measurement  of  the  area.    Use  only  the  area  above  the
established   baseline   in   the   calculations.      Several
algorithms  are  available  on  various  commercial  FT-IR
instruments  to  obtain  the  desired  baseline  corrected
areas.  The following is one suggested method:
12. 1.1.1      Retrieve   the   sample   absorbance   spectrum
from the computer storage disk.  With the wavenumber
expand  commands  available,  zoom  in  on  the  region  of
the  absorption  band(s)  of  interest.    Expand  until  this
region  is  only  slightly  larger  than  the  baseline  limit
regions given in Table 1.
12. 1.1.2      Employ   the   interactive   baseline   correction
routine  to  bring  the  spectral  baseline  to  coincide  with
the 0.0 absorbance line.  Refer to Table 1 for the upper
and   lower   wavenumber   regions   for   guidance   in
adjusting the baseline.  Expand in the absorbance scale
as  necessary  to  improve  the  observation  of  the  noise
and fine features of the spectrum in order to provide the
best  placement  of  the  baseline.    Apply  only  linear
corrections  with  the  fit  of  the  straight  line  through  the
points  on  both  sides  of  the  absorption  peak(s).    Note
that the peaks for boron and phosphorus are very close
together   and   thus   only   one   baseline   is   obtained
surrounding  both  peaks.  Figures  2  and  3  show  spectra
before  and  after,  respectively,  baseline  correction  for
boron and phosphorus spectral region.
12. 1.2   Measure   the   area   for   the   absorption   peak
between  the  upper  and  lower  wavenumbers  given  in
Table  1  for  the  integration  limits.    Most  computer
algorithms  handle  this  nicely.  However,  disable  the
automatic  zeroing  of  the  baseline  at  the  integration
limits.      If   not   disabled,   the   integration   would   not
represent  the  baseline  as  established  in  Section  12.1.1
and may result in errors.
12. 1.3   Repeat   Sections   12.1.1   and   12.1.2   for   each
component desired for each specimen measured.

The factors given here do not all have the same degree of certainty.  The factors for boron, phosphorus, and arsenic are
believed  to  be  correct  to  better  than  ±  10%.    The  other  factors  should  be  considered  approximations  and  used  for
estimations only.  A discussion of the origin of these factors is given in Related Information 1.

RELATED INFORMATION 1
DERIVATION OF FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING
CONCENTRATIONS AND DENSITIES OF ELEMENTS IN SILICON
NOTICE: This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  MF1630.    It  was  developed  as  non-mandatory
information  in  ASTM  during  the  initial  development  of  the  document  in  1994-5.    This  related  information  was
approved for publication by SEMI by full letter ballot procedures on March 14, 2004.
R1-1      The   factors   shown   in   Table   1   resulted   from
several  years  of  corrections  and  modifications  but  are
ultimately based on resistivity measurements on silicon
samples.  The  dopant  density,  or  the  concentration  of
impurities  for  this  test    method,  is  directly  obtained
from the conversion Tables found in SEMI MF723.
R1-2  Baber’s
5
calibration  factors  published  in  1980,
were   the   starting   point   for   the   current   factors.
Corrections  or  modifications,  or  both,  to  his  published
data follow in this discussion.
R1-2.1    Baber’s  LTFT-IR  study  utilized  the  conversion
relations  reported  by  Irvin
7
in  1962,  relating  resistivity
and impurity concentrations.  Currently, the conversion
tables  given  in  SEMI  MF723  are  believed  to  be  more
reliable.    Corrections  to  Baber’s  factors  were  made  to
reflect these new conversion tables.
R1-2.2    The  factors  of  Baber  relate  peak  heights  of  the
absorption  bands  to  concentrations.  Peak  heights  are
extremely  sensitive  to  several  FT-IR  parameters.    The
phosphorus  band  at  316.0  cm
−1
and the arsenic band at
382. 0  cm
−1
are  very  narrow,  about  0.25  cm
−1
,  and  thus
the  peak  heights  of  these  bands  vary  greatly  with
nominal resolution, type of apodization, degree of zero-
filling, and mechanical strain on the sample.  The boron
absorption  at  319.6  cm
−1
band  used  in  this  test  method
is   actually   a   composite   of   four   separate   boron
absorption  bands.    The  variability  of  the  measurement
of  the  absorption  bands  is  reduced  considerably  when
peak areas are used instead of peak heights.  The use of
peak  areas  is  common  in  the  field  and  their  use  is
specified in this test method.
R1-2.3    Further  minor  modifications  have  been  made
over the in the period from about 1985 to about 1995 in
several laboratories that use LTFT-IR spectrometers for
determination of electrically active impurities.
R1-2.3.1    Studies  with  and  without  the  white  light  on
the    silicon    samples,    covering    a    wide    range    of
concentrations,   are   valuable   as   tools   to   check   for
consistency of the boron and phosphorus factors, which
are  indeed  the  most  common  impurities.    With  the

only  the  net  carrier  absorption  bands  at  an  intensity
proportional      to      the      excess      majority      carrier
concentration.      These   data   along   with   the   total
impurities  obtained  with  white  light  on  the  samples
permitted    minor    adjustments    to    the    boron    or
phosphorus factors, or both.
R1-2.3.2    Silicon  samples  whose  resistivity  has  been
carefully  determined  have  been  measured  by  LTFT-IR
spectroscopy, and the results used to confirm or slightly
modify the calibration factors.
R1-3  In 1990, a pilot study was conducted in which ten
silicon   samples   were   examined   at   four   different
laboratories  by  either  LTFT-IR  or  photoluminescence,
or  both,  and  the  results  compared.    Even  though  each
laboratory  used  their  own  factors  and  modifications  of
this    test    method    for    determination    of    impurity
concentrations,  the  data  for  boron  and  phosphorus  all
agreed  to  within  ±  20%  of  the  average  value.    The
factors  given  in  this  test  method  are  approximately
equal to the average values from that study.
R1-4  In  summary,  the  factors  given  in  Table  1  are  a
result   of   continued   refinement   as   more   and   better
measurements   have   been   made.      However,   they
ultimately  correspond  to  the  resistivity  measurements
and  the  conversion  to  dopant  (impurity)  concentrations
as  given  in  SEMI  MF723.    The  factors  for  boron    and
phosphorus  have  the  highest  degree  of  certainty  since
these  two  elements    are  the  most  commonly  measured
and are therefore studied the most.  The factors for the
other    elements,    especially    aluminum,    antimony,
gallium,   and   indium,   should   be   considered   only
approximations    and    used    only    to    estimate    their
concentrations in silicon.

PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY
MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  for  publication  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  16,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org

September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.    Original  edition  published  by  ASTM  International  as
ASTM F 1708-96.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1708-02
1  Purpose
1. 1 Polycrystalline   silicon   is   used   as   the   starting
material  for  growth  of  large  single  crystal  ingots  by
Czochralski methods.
1. 2 Although  Czochralski  grown  ingots  are  intention-
ally   doped   during   crystal   growth   to   the   desired
resistivity and type, the dopant levels in the polysilicon
must be known to calculate the amount of dopant to be
added.  This practice provides a means to determine the
impurity  levels  in  granular  polysilicon  to  be  used  for
crystal growth.
1. 3 Carbon levels in polysilicon must be known so that
the   concentration   of   carbon   in   the   ingot   can   be
controlled to a low level.
1. 4 This practice has applicability in production control,
quality   assurance,   materials   research,   and   materials
acceptance.
2  Scope
2. 1 This  practice  describes  a  procedure  to  consolidate
granular polysilicon into a solid rod and then to convert
the  polysilicon  rod  into  a  single  crystal  by  a  float-zone
technique.  The resultant single crystal ingot is used for
the determination of trace impurities in the polysilicon.
These  impurities  are  acceptor  and  donor  components
(usually  boron,  aluminum,  phosphorus,  arsenic,  and
antimony) as well as substitutional carbon.
2. 2 The useful range of impurity concentration covered
by this practice is 0.002 to 100 parts per billion atomic
(ppba) for acceptor and donor impurities, and 0.02 to 15
parts   per   million   atomic   (ppma)   for   carbon.      The
acceptor and donor impurities in a slice taken from the
single crystal ingot are analyzed by photoluminescence
or   infrared   spectroscopies.   The   carbon   impurity   is
determined    by    analysis    of    a    slice    by    infrared
spectroscopy.
2. 3 This  practice  is  applicable  only  to  evaluation  of
polysilicon     granules     as     produced     by     thermal
decomposition  and  deposition  of  silane,  or  one  of  the
chlorosilanes, onto high purity seeds of polysilicon in a
continuous or batch fluid bed reactor.  The granules are
near  spherical  in  shape  and  range  in  size  from  200  to
3000 μm with a mean size of about 900–1200 μm.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  guides  and  determine  the
applicability  of  regulatory  or  other  limitations  prior  to
use.
3  Limitations
3. 1 The  quartz  tubes  used  in  this  procedure  must  be  of
high purity, especially in regards to the impurities to be
measured.    Boron  is  of  particular  concern  since  it  is
always  present  in  quartz  and  may  frequently  appear  in
uncharacteristically high concentrations in polysilicon.
3. 2 All chemicals and gases used in this procedure must
be free of components to be measured or they may give
extraneously high results.
3. 3 Loss  of  single  crystal  during  the  zone  pass  will
produce  an  ingot  that  may  give  unsatisfactory  results.
The   quality   of   the   infrared   or   photoluminescence
spectra usually reveals the lack of single crystal.

6  Summary of Practice
6. 1 Granular   polysilicon   is   converted   into   a   single
crystal silicon rod in a two-step procedure.
6. 1.1  First,  the  silicon  granules  are  consolidated  into  a
polysilicon  rod  by  melting  fluidized  granules  into  the
molten  (bottom)  end  of  a  silicon  pedestal  during  a
downward  pass  of  the  coil  of  the  zone  furnace.    After
about 15 g of polysilicon has been melted and cooled in
the zone process, a polysilicon rod about 8 to 12 mm in
diameter and up to 70 mm in length is obtained.
6. 1.2  In the second step, a single crystal silicon seed is
melted into the tail end of the polycrystalline rod and a
single zone pass is done in the upward direction to level
the  impurities  and  to  convert  the  silicon  to  a  single
crystal rod.  This produces a single crystal silicon ingot
about  8  to  12  mm  in  diameter  and  up  to  70  mm  in
length  from  which  a  section  is  sliced  for  measurement
of  impurities.    The  entire  consolidation  and  zoning
requires about 30 min to accomplish.
6. 1.3  A  slice  2  to  4  mm  thick  is  taken  from  the  center
one-third   of   the   single   crystal   silicon   ingot   for
measurement      of      impurities      by      infrared      or
photoluminescence spectroscopies.
7  Apparatus
7. 1 Acid Exhaust Fume Hood — To provide for exhaust
of  acid  fumes,  a  clean  air  environment  (ISO  Class  6
minimum, as defined in ISO 14544-1), a drain for acids
and  water,  and  a  deionized  water  supply.    This  hood
provides  for  the  cleaning  of  quartz  containers,  funnels,
and tubes used in the melter/zoner as well as a place to
etch silicon pieces and samples used in this practice.
NOTE 1:  ISO  class  6  is  about  the  same  as  Class  1000  as
defined in Federal Standard 209E).
7. 2 Laminar Flow Hood — To provide a flow of clean
(ISO  Class  6  minimum)  air  for  drying  of  components
and the etched and clean silicon pieces.
7. 3 Quartz   Sample   Containers   —   200   to   300   mL
capacity quartz bottles to contain and transport granular
polysilicon samples.
7. 4 Quartz  Funnel  —  A  funnel  of  sufficient  size  to
transfer granular polysilicon from the sample container
to the 15 mm inside diameter quartz tube.
7. 5 Quartz Tube — A section of high purity quartz tube
with  18  mm  outside  diameter,  15  mm  inside  diameter,
and  a  length  of  556  mm.    The  inside  diameter  and
outside  diameter  variances  should  be  small  to  avoid
problems with clearances both internally and externally.
This  tube  provides  the  working  enclosure  for  both  the
consolidation and the zone leveling within the confines
of the working coil of the melter/float zone apparatus.


SEMI MF1708-1104 © SEMI 2004 3
7. 6 Melter/Float Zone Apparatus — A radio frequency
(rf) generator operating between 2.0 and 3.0 MHz with
a  copper,  water-cooled  working  coil  for  rf  coupling  to
the silicon (see Figure 1).  The coil shall have an inside
diameter of 20 mm to accommodate the 18 mm outside
diameter quartz tube and shall have sufficient power to
sustain  a  molten  zone  of  at  least  2  cm.    Controls  to
adjust  the  power  output  of  the  rf  generator  must  be
readily  available  to  the  operator.    The  apparatus  shall
have  a  carriage  to  vertically  support  and  move  the
quartz tube through the coil in a smooth and continuous
manner.  The upper and lower endpieces of the carriage
shall  be  designed  with  chucks  to  hold  silicon  pedestals
as  well  as  the  quartz  tubing.    These  endpieces  shall
provide a seal to exclude air from the inside of the tube
and  have  connections  for  argon  entry  at  the  bottom
endpiece  and  exhaust  at  the  top.    Manual  as  well  as
motorized  movement  of  the  carriage  in  the  vertical
direction    while    minimizing    horizontal    motion    is
essential.    This  entire  apparatus  is  set  up  and  utilized
inside a Class 6 clean room.

7. 7 PTFE  Plunger-Diffuser  —  A  cylindrical  piece  of
PTFE  machined  to  close  tolerance  that  fits  snugly  but
can be moved freely inside the quartz tube.  This PTFE
plunger  is  drilled  with  an  array  of  small  holes  for
diffusion of argon gas from the bottom endpiece of the
zoner  carriage,  through  a  bed  of  polysilicon  granules,
and  finally  exhausted  through  the  top  endpiece.    The
bottom of this plunger is machined to fit on the end of a
stainless   steel   rod   that   is   extended   through   and
supported by the bottom endpiece.  This rod provides a
way to vertically move the PTFE plunger/diffuser plate
within the quartz tube.

steel  that  fits  inside  the  quartz  and  upon  the  upper  end
of  the  stainless  steel  rod  extending  from  the  lower
endpiece  with  a  hole  drilled  in  the  top  about  3  mm
inside  diameter  and  1  cm  deep  (see  Figure  1).    This
supports  a  2.5  mm  single  crystal  silicon  seed  rod  in  a
near  vertical  position  while  allowing  some  (about  2
mm) horizontal movement at the top of an 80 mm rod.
7. 9 Hydrogen  Torch  —  Constructed  by  restricting  the
end  of  a
¼  in.  outside  diameter  piece  of  stainless  steel
tubing  and  drilling  a  1.5  mm  hole  as  the  orifice.    This
torch is used to preheat the silicon to the point where rf
coupling occurs.

9  Hazards
9. 1 The   acids   used   in   this   practice   are   potentially
harmful and must be handled with the utmost of care at
all   times.      Hydrofluoric   acid   (HF)   solutions   are
especially    hazardous    to    the    eyes,    skin,    mucous
membranes, and the lungs.  Anyone using HF and other
acids  must  be  familiar  with  the  potential  hazards  and
must    employ    proper    techniques    and    preventive
measures to avoid injury.
9. 2 The   rf   generator   and   coil   of   the   melter-zoner
apparatus can be injurious to the operator if the operator
is   not   properly   trained   in   working   with   electrical
connections, rf fields, and hot parts.
9. 3 Use  eye  protection  to  protect  the  operator  from  the
bright  light  of  the  molten  silicon  in  the  melter-zoner
apparatus.
10  Sampling
10. 1 Granular  polysilicon  samples  are  best  handled  in
clean,  dry  quartz  bottles.    Samples  are  always  taken
with clean silicon or quartz scoops or devices.
10. 2 Granular polysilicon is commercially produced by
a   continuous   process   in   a   fluidized   bed   reactor.
Samples  for  evaluation  by  this  practice  can  be  taken  in
process,  while  packaging  (normally  in  270–300  kg
specially  lined  drums),  or  at  the  point  of  use.    The
sampling  point  is  therefore  determined  by  the  purpose
of the evaluation.
11  Reference Specimen
11. 1 Use   a   large   homogeneous   sample   of   granular
polysilicon reference material to monitor the process of
consolidation and conversion to a single crystal silicon.
Periodically   and   repeatedly   convert   this   reference
material   to   single   crystal   silicon   to   establish   the
consistency and cleanliness of this practice.
11. 2 Collect    and    statistically    evaluate    the    values
obtained by low-temperature Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy  for  carbon  and  the  acceptor  and  donor
impurities  in  the  analytical  slices  to  establish  and  keep
the process in control.
12  Preparation of Apparatus
12. 1 Take  the  utmost  care  to  ensure  the  cleanliness  of
all parts of the melter/zoner, especially the quartz tube,
sample  containers,  transfer  funnel,  and  the  carriage
endpieces.
12. 1.1  Clean the inner part of the quartz tube and etch
it with 3:1 HF:HNO
3
.  Following the acid etch, rinse the
tube  with  copious  amounts  of  DI  water  and  allow  it  to
dry in a laminar air flow hood.
12. 1.1.1  Warning:   Acids,   especially   HF,   are   very
hazardous  to  the  eyes,  skin,  mucous  membranes,  and
lungs.  Anyone using these acids must be familiar with
and use precautionary means to avoid injury.
12. 1.2  Etch, clean and dry other quartz parts, including
sample  containers  and  funnels  as  in  Section  12.1.1
except that the etchant used is 1:1 HF:H
2
O.
12. 1.3  Carefully clean the carriage endpieces, stainless
steel  rods,  and  chucks  of  the  melter/zoner  by  rinsing
with  methanol  and  allowing  them  to  thoroughly  dry  in
the clean room environment.
12. 2 Prepare  the  silicon  pedestals  and  single  crystal
seed  rods  for  use  by  etching  with  a  continuous  stream
of  the  MAE  for  15  to  20  s,  followed  quickly  with  a
copious rinse of DI water.  Air dry or blot dry with lint-
free paper.
13  Procedure
13. 1 Assemble  a  freshly  etched  and  dried  quartz  tube
into the carriage endpieces.
NOTE 2:  Freshly,   as   referred   to   here   and   the   following
paragraphs, refers to a time of less than 1 h.
13. 2 Mount  a  freshly  etched  and  dried  silicon  pedestal
(6 by 6 by 100 mm) in the upper chuck and place in the
upper  endpiece.    Center  the  silicon  pedestal  within  the
quartz  tube.    Adjust  the  carriage  so  that  the  bottom  of
the silicon pedestal is inside but not below the working
rf  coil.    Remove  the  pedestal  and  chuck  and  set  aside
for later use.
13. 3 Mount  a  freshly  cleaned  PTFE  plunger-diffuser
part  on  the  lower  rod  assembly  and  place  it  inside  the
bottom  of  the  quartz  tube.    Secure  the  rod  assembly  to
the  lower  endpiece  and  carefully  move  the  rod  and
plunger to a point of about 100 to 120 mm below the rf
coil.    Start  the  argon  purge  and  diffuser  gas  flow  at  a
rate of about 0.1 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM)
through  the  lower  portal,  PTFE  diffuser,  and  exhaust
out  the  top  of  the  open  quartz  tube  through  the  upper
endpiece.
13. 4 Introduce  the  granular  polysilicon  sample  through
the  upper  end  piece  with  a  quartz  funnel.    Fill  with


SEMI MF1708-1104 © SEMI 2004 5
about 25 g of polysilicon until the upper bed of granules
is  near  the  lower  part  of  the  rf  coil.    Reduce  the  argon
flow until only the top layer of granules are fluidized.
13. 5 Remove  the  funnel  and  replace  the  upper  chuck
and silicon pedestal.  Reposition the carriage so that the
pedestal is midway between the rf coil.
13. 6 Ignite   the   hydrogen-air   torch   and   position   it
slightly  above  and  about  30  mm  from  the  working  coil
impacting  the  outside  of  the  quartz  tube.    Turn  on  and
increase  the  rf  power  to  about  80%  of  the  operating
power  needed  for  melting.    Watch  for  rf  coupling  with
the  silicon  rod,  which  will  occur  in  about  2  min  as  is
evident from the red glow of the pedestal.  Turn off the
torch  and  move  the  carriage  upward  at  a  rate  that  the
red  hot  zone  follows  the  rf  coil  until  the  hot  zone  is  at
the bottom of the silicon pedestal.
13. 7 Increase  the  rf  power  until  the  bottom  of  the
pedestal  melts.    Move  the  position  of  the  granules
upward  with  the  lower  rod  and  PTFE  plunger  until  the
top  of  the  fluidized  bed  begins  to  melt  into  the  upper
pedestal.  As the granules melt into the upper pedestal,
move the entire carriage upward.
NOTE 3:  The  melt  freezes  as  it  leaves  the  working  zone  of
the rf coil.  The consolidated rod diameter is smaller than the
inside  diameter  of  the  quartz  tube  so  it  does  not  contact  the
tube walls.
13. 8 Continue    consolidation    growth    with    minor
adjustments   until   a   consolidated   polysilicon   rod   of
about  9  mm  in  diameter  and  60  mm  in  length  is
obtained.    Lower  the  polysilicon  granules  bed  and
reduce the rf power permitting the tail end of the rod to
solidify.  Note the time required for the melting process
(normally about 12 min).
13. 9 Remove the lower rod and plunger from the quartz
tube by removal of part of the lower endpiece.  Let the
excess  polysilicon  granules  fall  out  the  bottom  of  the
tube and discard them.
13. 10 Remove   the   PTFE   plunger/diffuser   from   the
lower  stainless  steel  rod  and  replace  it  with  the  lower
seed chuck (see Figure 1).
13. 11 Mount  a  freshly  etched  and  dried  single  crystal
silicon seed (2.5 by 2.5 by 100 mm) in the lower chuck.
Place the silicon seed rod, chuck, and lower rod into the
quartz  tube  through  the  bottom  as  before.    Move  the
lower  rod  upward  until  the  seed  crystal  is  about  5  mm
below   the   tip   of   the   consolidated   polysilicon   rod
previously   produced.      Purge   the   entire   tube   for   a
minimum of 1 min at a flow rate of 0.5 SCFM.
13. 12 Reduce  the  argon  purge  to  about  0.1  SCFM.
Reignite  the  hydrogen  torch  and  increase  the  rf  power
to  80%  needed  to  melt  silicon.    Watch  for  the  glow  of
the  consolidated  polysilicon  rod  as  rf  coupling  begins.
Shut off the torch.
13. 13 Increase    rf    power    until    the    consolidated
polysilicon  rod  tip  is  molten  and  then  raise  the  seed  to
penetrate  into  the  melt.    Hold  in  this  position  until  the
seed has taken sufficient heat to melt and becomes one
with the melt from the consolidated polysilicon rod.
13. 14 In a trial and error mode, increase the rf power as
needed  to  carry  out  the  one  pass  zone  leveling.    When
the   proper   rf   power   is   established,   activate   the
motorized  carriage  for  movement  downward  (floating
zone  movement  is  upward)  at  a  rate  to  match  that
employed  during  the  consolidation  process,  typically  a
zone  rate  of  about  5.0  mm  per  minute.    Continue  the
zoning  until  the  entire  consolidated  polysilicon  rod  has
been  converted  to  a  single  crystal  as  is  evident  by  the
four  growth  facet  lines.    Now,  slightly  reduce  the  rf
power   and   slowly   move   the   lower   rod   downward
separating  the  single  crystal  ingot  from  the  polysilicon
rod.  Turn off the rf power.  Allow about 2 min for the
ingot to cool.
13. 15 Remove the single crystal ingot and break off the
seed  crystal  after  scoring  with  a  diamond  scribe.    Save
the  remaining  seed  for  growth  of  the  next  crystal.
Examine  the  crystal  to  be  sure  the  growth  facet  lines
extend the entire length of the ingot.
13. 16 Mount  the  crystal  in  the  saw  chuck  and  cut  an
analytical  slice  2  to  4  mm  thick  as  needed  from  the
center one-third of the crystal.
NOTE 4:  Since  segregation  of  the  impurities  occurs  both
during  the  consolidation  step  and  the  conversion  to  single
crystal,  the  one  pass  zone  during  the  conversion  to  single
crystal  at  the  same  rate  as  the  consolidation  step  effectively
levels   these   impurities.      Thus,   the   concentration   of   the
impurities  in  the  ingot  is  essentially  constant  except  at  both
extremes.
13. 17 Prepare   the   analytical   slice   for   infrared   or
photoluminescence  spectroscopic  measurements  with
application  of  a  bright  chemical  etch  or  a  mechanical
polish.
13. 17.1  To   etch,   hold   the   slice   with   polyethylene
forceps  and  suspend  it  into  a  PTFE  beaker  filled  with
the  mixed  acid  etchant  as  described  in  Section  8.5.
Gently  stir  the  solution  with  a  magnetic  stir  bar  while
immersing  the  silicon  slice  for  4  min.    Remove  and
quickly  rinse  with  copious  amounts  of  DI  water.    Air
dry the silicon slice, which is now ready for analysis.
13. 18 Utilize   the   appropriate   test   methods   for   the
desired  analysis.    For  carbon  content,  test  by  infrared
spectrophotometry  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF1391.
For  determination  of  donor  and  acceptor  contents,  test
either by low-temperature FT-IR analysis in accordance


SEMI MF1708-1104 © SEMI 2004 6
with  SEMI  MF1630  or  by  photoluminescence  analysis
in accordance with SEMI MF1389, or both.
14  Interpretation of Results
14. 1 The     results     obtained     from     spectroscopic
techniques  on  the  analytical  slice  as  obtained,  directly
represent  the  impurity  concentrations  in  the  granular
polysilicon   provided   no   impurity   contamination   is
found  during  the  process.    In  reality,  there  is  always
small  impurity  contamination  during  the  consolidation
and  conversion  to  a  single  crystal.    This  contamination
leads  to  results  higher  than  actually  present  in  the
granular polysilicon.
15  Precision
15. 1 In  the  mid-nineties,  the  precision  of  this  practice
was  established  by  one  laboratory  as  follows:  A  large
sample of granular polysilicon was evaluated repeatedly
and  periodically  by  this  practice  for  over  more  than  a
year.      Low   temperature   Fourier   transform   infrared
spectroscopy   was   used   to   measure   the   impurity
concentrations.      The   combined   errors   of   sample
handling,  consolidation  to  polysilicon  rod,  conversion
to a single crystal ingot, and the infrared determinations
gave a standard deviation of 0.03 ppba at the 0.06 ppba
concentration  level  for  boron  and  phosphorus  and  a
standard  deviation  of  0.03  ppma  for  interstitial  carbon
at the 0.07 ppma level.
15. 2 Analysis of more recent similar data indicates that
the standard deviation is less than 0.02 ppba at the 0.04
ppba concentration level for boron and phosphorus and
0. 02 ppma for interstitial carbon at the 0.05 ppma level.

PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON
RODS BY FLOAT-ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  for  publication  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  16,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org

September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.    Original  edition  published  by  ASTM  International  as
ASTM F 1723-96.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1723-02.
1  Purpose
1. 1  The concentration of acceptor and donor impurities
in  polycrystalline  silicon  (polysilicon)  is  used  by  the
grower  of  monocrystalline  silicon  ingots  to  calculate
the  additional  dopant  needed  to  produce  the  required
ingot  resistivity  or  to  predict  the  resistivity  of  undoped
ingots.
1. 2  The  concentration  of  acceptor  and  donor  elements
and  carbon  in  the  polysilicon  is  used  by  the  crystal
grower to determine material acceptance.
1. 3  The  concentration  of  impurities  in  the  polysilicon
is  used  for  monitoring  source  gas  purity,  polysilicon
production  processes,  development  of  new  processes,
and materials acceptance purposes.
1. 4  This  practice  describes  the  sampling  system  and
float-zone  crystal  growth  procedures  used  to  prepare
polysilicon   core   samples   for   analysis   of   acceptor,
donor, and carbon content.
2  Scope
2. 1  This   practice   covers   procedures   for   sampling
polycrystalline  silicon  rods  and  growing  single  crystals
from  these  samples  by  the  float-zone  technique.    The
resultant    single    crystal    ingots    are    analyzed    by
spectrophotometric   methods   to   determine   the   trace
impurities in the polysilicon.  These trace impurities are
acceptor  (usually  boron  or  aluminum,  or  both),  donor
(usually  phosphorus  or  arsenic,  or  both),  and  carbon
impurities.
2. 2  The useful range of impurity concentration covered
by this practice is 0.002 to 100 parts per billion atomic
(ppba) for acceptor and donor impurities, and 0.02 to 15
parts  per  million  atomic  (ppma)  for  carbon  impurity.
These  impurities  are  analyzed  in  the  ingot  samples  by
infrared or photoluminescence spectroscopy.
2. 3  This  practice  is  applicable  only  to  evaluation  of
polysilicon  ingots  grown  by  a  method  that  utilizes  a
slim  silicon  rod  (filament)  upon  which  the  polycrystal-
line silicon is deposited.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  guides  and  determine  the
applicability  of  regulatory  or  other  limitations  prior  to
use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  Polysilicon  rods  that  are  cracked,  highly  stressed,
or have deep dendritic growth cannot be sampled due to
shattering or breaking during the coring process.
3. 2  Polysilicon  cores  with  fractures,  cracked  surfaces,
or voids in the surface are difficult to clean.  Impurities
are not completely etched out of the cracks or voids, or
etch  residues  may  remain  in  the  cracks,  thus  contrib-
uting  contamination.    Cracked  or  highly  stressed  cores
may shatter or break during the zoning process.  Cores
must  be  cleaned  after  fabrication  to  remove  any  oil,
grease, or handling contamination.
3. 3  The purity of the acids and deionized water (DI) is
critically  important.    Impurities  in  the  acids,  etching
apparatus,   or   water   may   interfere   with   accurate,
reproducible  analysis.    Etching  and  zoning  should  be
done  in  a  clean  room  to  minimize  impurities  from  the
ambient  air,  walls,  floors,  and  furniture.    The  specific
acid  mixture,  acid  etch  temperature,  silicon  removal
rate, number of etch-rinse cycles, and exposure time are
other  factors  that  must  be  monitored  and  controlled  to
prevent  impurity  interferences.    Any  materials  that
contact  the  etched  cores,  such  as  boats  and  containers,
must  be  cleaned  before  use  and  monitored  to  prevent
contamination.  Gloves or other materials used to wrap
the  etched  cores  must  be  tested  and  monitored  to
prevent contamination.
3. 4  The   zoner   itself,   especially   the   preheater,   can
introduce impurities into the growing silicon ingot.  The
walls,  preheater,  coil,  and  seals  of  the  zoner  are  usual
sources of contamination.  Maintaining a clean zoner is
very   important   to   the   procedures   covered   by   this
practice.


SEMI MF1723-1104 © SEMI 2004 2
3. 5  Any   variation   from   the   prescribed   float-zoning
procedures that can affect the distribution of the volatile
impurities  in  the  gas,  liquid,  and  solid  phases  will  alter
the  results.    Variations  in  core  diameter,  zone  dimen-
sions,  pull  rate,  seal  purity,  or  ambient  conditions  may
alter the effective distribution coefficient or evaporation
rate  and  thus  change  the  amount  of  impurity  incorpor-
ated into the crystal.
3. 6  Each  acceptor  or  donor  element  and  carbon  have
unique  segregation  coefficients.    By  growing  several
ingots  with  lengths  up  to  30  times  the  zone  length,  the
effective   segregation   coefficient   can   be   measured.
These  should  agree  with  published  values.

,

Wafers
are   cut   from   this   ingot   at   equilibrium   positions
corresponding  to  the  segregation  coefficient.    Wafers
cut  from  other  locations  may  not  accurately  represent
the amount of impurity in the polysilicon.  If ingots can
not  be  grown  to  sufficient  length  to  achieve  the  flat
portion of the axial concentration profile, wafers can be
cut  from  the  ingot,  and  the  measured  values  corrected
for   the   effective   segregation   coefficient,   based   on
repeated measurements of control rods.
3. 7  In  the  conversion  of  the  core  to  a  monocrystal
during zoning, it is possible to lose structure and have a
zoned  rod  that  is  not  monocrystalline.    Ingots  with
excessive  crystallographic  defects  give  photolumines-
cence  or  infrared  spectra  with  excessive  noise;  such
spectra  are  difficult  to  interpret  accurately.    In  extreme
cases, it is not possible to obtain acceptable spectra.

5. 1.2.3  deposition  layer  (growth  layer), n —  the  layer
of  polysilicon  surrounding  the  filament,  extending  to
the outer diameter of the poly rod.
5. 1.2.4     filament,   slim   rod, n —   a   small   diameter
silicon rod, assembled into a U-shape, used to provide a
substrate  or  seed  for  the  deposition  of  polycrystalline
silicon.
6  Summary of Practice
6. 1  One or more core samples, selected according to a
prescribed plan, are taken from the polysilicon rod to be
evaluated.  Cores can be taken parallel or perpendicular
to the filament at both ends of the rod.  The preparation
and  zoning  process  is  the  same  for  both  types,  but  the
data calculation and carbon analysis are different.
6. 2  After  inspection  for  damage,  the  polysilicon  cores
are  identified  and  scheduled  for  etching  and  crystal
growth.  Cores are etched in acid, rinsed clean, mounted
into    a    float-zone    crystal    growth    apparatus,    and
converted to single crystal ingots.  Cores must be float-
zoned  as  soon  as  possible  after  being  etched  to  avoid
surface  contamination.    Studies  in  one  laboratory  in  an
ISO Class 5 (Note 1) clean room indicated that surface
contamination   can   occur   after   36   h.      For   each
laboratory,   maximum   holding   times   and   handling-
packaging procedures must be determined.  Cores must
be reetched if the maximum holding period is exceeded.
To  extend  the  holding  period,  cores  may  be  wrapped
and  sealed  in  a  suitably  clean  material  and  stored  in  a
clean environment until use.
NOTE 1:  ISO Class 5 as defined in ISO 14644-1 is about the
same as Class 100 as defined in Federal Standard 209E.
6. 3  A control rod is etched and float-zoned along with
the  sample  rods  to  monitor  any  contamination  inter-
ferences  from  the  sample  preparation  and  float  zoning
process.
6. 4  The   polysilicon   cores   are   converted   to   single
crystal  ingots  by  the  float-zone  technique,  using  one
zone pass in an argon atmosphere.  After crystal growth
is     completed,     the     ingots     are     checked     for
monocrystalline character, diameter, and length.
6. 5  Sections of the ingot are selected for measurement
of acceptor, donor, and carbon content, according to the
individual segregation coefficients for these elements.
6. 6  From  the  selected  sections  of  the  ingot,  wafers  are
cut  and  prepared  for  analysis  by  spectrophotometric
techniques    described    in    SEMI    MF1389,    SEMI
MF1391, and SEMI MF1630.

9  Hazards
9. 1  It   is   required   that   the   user   have   a   working
knowledge   of   fabrication   techniques,   acid   handling
practices, and crystal growth furnaces.  Good laboratory
practices also must be understood.
9. 2  This practice uses hot acid to etch away the surface
of   the   polysilicon   rod.      The   etchant   is   potentially
harmful  and  must  be  handled  in  an  acid  exhaust  fume
hood  with  utmost  care  at  all  times.    Hydrofluoric  acid
solutions  are  particularly  hazardous.    All  precautions
normally   used   with   these   acids   should   be   strictly
observed.    They  should  not  be  used  by  anyone  who  is
not familiar with the specific preventative measures and
first  aid  treatments  given  in  the  appropriate  Material
Safety Data Sheet.
9. 3  The  crystal  growth  furnace  uses  radio  frequency
(RF)  power  (generator  and  coil)  to  supply  power  for
melting  silicon,  about  1400°C.    The  user  must  be
trained  in  working  with  electrical  connections,  pressu-
rized gas lines, RF fields, and hot parts.
9. 4  The  molten  silicon  in  the  melt  zone  emits  a  bright
light  and  operators  may  be  exposed  to  this  light  for
several  hours.    This  exposure  requires  the  use  of  eye
protection.
10  Sampling
10. 1  The  cores  shall  contain  material  representative  of
the  growth  process  used  to  form  the  polysilicon  rod.
The  cores  are  intended  to  be  representative  of  the
polysilicon rod being sampled.
10. 2  A  number  of  cores  can  be  taken  at  different
locations   of   the   polysilicon   rod   to   satisfy   various
sample plans.  Samples taken should cover both ends of
the rod.  Two typical sampling methods are taking cores
parallel  to  the  filament  and  taking  cores  perpendicular
to  the  filament  as  shown  in  Figures  1  and  2.    The
parallel core system is described in Section 10.2.1.  The
perpendicular   core   system   is   described   in   Section
10. 2.2.

10. 2.1  Parallel  Cores  —  As  shown  in  Figure  1,  cores
are  taken  parallel  to  the  filament  at  a  minimum  length
of  100  mm  and  a  diameter  of  20  mm.    Two  different
cores,  a  filament  core  and  a  growth  layer  core,  are
required  to  calculate  the  total  polysilicon  rod  impurity
content.
10. 2.1.1  Parallel  Filament  Cores  —  Cores  including
the  filament  are  representative  of  the  filament  and  the
initial deposition layer on the filament.  These cores are
float zoned, analyzed, and the values combined with the
growth layer cores to calculate a total value.
10. 2.1.2  Parallel  Growth  Layer  Cores  —  Cores  not
including   the   filament,   only   the   growth   layer,   are
representative  of  the  poly  deposited  onto  the  filament.
These  cores  are  float-zoned,  analyzed,  and  the  values
combined  with  the  filament  core  values  to  calculate  a
total value.
10. 2.1.3  Parallel Core Sampling Locations
10. 2.1.3.1  Radial   Location   —   Cores   can   be   taken
across the entire rod diameter to check radial uniformity
of  the  deposition  layer.    Since  the  outer  surface  may
contain surface cracks or surface roughness, the outer 5
mm should not be sampled.
10. 2.1.3.2  Axial  Location  —  For  an  entire  U-rod  of
polysilicon,  cores  usually  are  taken  from  the  short
bridging section or from a region on the long rod within
50  mm  of  either  end,  but  may  be  taken  at  any  location
to check axial uniformity of deposition.
10. 2.2  Perpendicular  Cores  —  As  shown  in  Figure  2,
20-mm  diameter  cores  are  taken  through  the  diameter
of the polysilicon rod with length same as the diameter
of  the  poly  rod.    Cores  are  taken  so  that  the  filament
and  material  from  all  parts  of  the  deposition  layer  are
included.    For  accurate  calculation  of  the  impurities  at
various  growth  layers,  at  least  one  end  of  the  perpen-
dicular  core  should  include  the  outer  skin  layer.    For
rods  less  than  60-mm  diameter,  it  is  not  possible  to
produce  single  crystal  ingots  of  sufficient  zone  length
for accurate analysis.  In this case, cores parallel to the
filament are taken for analysis.
10. 2.2.1  Perpendicular  Growth  Layer  Cores  —  Cores
without  the  intersected  filament,  as  shown  in  Figure  2,
can  be  zoned  and  analyzed  to  determine  the  impurities
in  the  deposition  layer.    To  find  the  impurities  in  the
total  rod,  the  filament  must  be  analyzed  separately  and
combined  with  the  growth  layer  results.    Values  are
calculated using the formulas for parallel cores.
10. 2.2.2  Perpendicular   Core   Sampling   Location   —
For  an  entire  U-rod  of  polysilicon,  cores  usually  are
taken from the short bridging section, or from a region
on the long rod within 50 mm of either end.  Cores may
be  taken  at  any  location  to  check  axial  uniformity  of
deposition,  but  are  not  taken  at  the  bend  of  the  U-rod,
due to stresses in this area.
10. 3  Filament Analysis — If a parallel or perpendicular
filament  core  can  not  be  taken,  the  filament  may  be
analyzed  separately,  then  combined  with  the  growth
layer  analysis.    For  filaments  that  are  single  crystal,  or
nearly  single  crystal,  wafers  can  be  cut,  prepared,  and
analyzed by spectrophotometric techniques described in
SEMI MF1389, SEMI MF1391, and SEMI MF1630.
11  Reference Specimens
11. 1  Use polysilicon control rods to monitor the purity
of  the  core  preparation  techniques,  acid  etch  bath,  and
zoning  conditions.    Drill  a  large  number  of  deposition
layer  cores,  20-mm  diameter  by  100-mm  length  from
polysilicon  rods  having  a  uniform  deposition  layer.
Select  control  rods  with  low  impurity  levels,  such  as
acceptor/donor   values   about   0.01   ppba   and   carbon
values  about  0.05  ppma  to  allow  the  early  detection  of
trace  impurities  from  interference  sources.    After  re-
peated  analysis,  assign  values  for  donor,  acceptor,  and
carbon  concentrations.    Then  etch,  zone,  and  analyze
these control rods on a periodic basis to monitor purity
of  the  sample  preparation,  etching,  and  zoning  pro-
cesses.
11. 2  Control  chart  values  for  the  acceptor,  donor,  and
carbon   concentrations   from   the   control   rods   using
standard   statistical   process-control   techniques   and
statistical rules to determine if the current values are in
control.    If  these  values  exceed  the  statistical  limits,
make corrections and repeat the analysis.
12  Procedure
12. 1  Seed Preparation
12. 1.1  Prepare   round   or   rectangular   seeds   by   core
drilling, cutting, or crystal pulling from high purity float
zone  ingots.    Use  seed  material  of  zero  dislocation
density with acceptor content less than 0.05 ppba, donor
content  less  than  0.05  ppba,  and  carbon  content  less
than 0.1 ppma.
12. 1.2  Select a high purity single crystal seed, 3 mm to
5  mm  in  diameter,  for  initiation  of  float  zone  crystal
growth.  Orient the seed 〈111〉 within 0.5°.
12. 1.3  Clean,  acid  etch,  rinse  and  dry  the  seed  to  the
same  procedure,  using  the  same  equipment  described
for  core  samples.    To  avoid  surface  contamination,  use
seeds  within  36  h  after  etching,  or  store  them  in  a
manner to prevent contamination.

12. 2  Core Etching
12. 2.1  Do  all  operations  in  the  etch  bench  clean  room
and zoner clean room with operators in full clean room
attire, including gloves, hood, and mask.
12. 2.2  Make a fresh acid etch mixture and fill the tanks
in  the  etch  bench.    When  the  proper  temperatures  and
water  flows  are  achieved,  place  the  core  samples  into
clean etch boats and etch, rinse, and dry the cores.  Use
the HNO
3
-HF acid etching mixture, etching at least two
cycles,  to  remove  a  minimum  of  100  μm  from  the
surface of the core sample.  This is necessary in order to
remove  surface  damage  caused  by  the  coring  process.
Other  acid  etch  mixtures  can  be  used,  but  must  be
evaluated  and  controlled  to  ensure  effectiveness  and
avoid impurity interferences.
12. 2.3  After   etching,   float   zone   cores   as   soon   as
possible  to  reduce  the  probability  of  contamination.
Re-etch   cores   if   the   maximum   holding   period   is
exceeded.  To extend the holding period, seal the cores
in  a  suitably  clean  material  and  store  in  a  clean  room
environment.
12. 3  Preparation of Apparatus
12. 3.1  Clean  the  core  drilling  apparatus  to  prevent
contamination of the core sample.
12. 3.2  Clean  the  etch  bench  and  check  the  DI  rinse
water  purity,  temperature,  total  organic  carbon,  and
resistivity.
12. 3.3  Clean  the  float  zone  chamber.    Using  the  stain-
less steel wire brush, scrub the walls of the chamber to
loosen  silicon  deposits  and  remove  the  loose  particles
with the vacuum cleaner.  Wipe the walls, holders, and
coil  with  clean  room  wipes  soaked  with  a  high  purity
solvent.    Inspect  cooling  water  reservoir,  water  flow,
water   temperature,   coil   and   preheater   connections,
shaft,  coil  feedthroughs,  door  seals,  hose  connections,
travel stops, and rotations.
12. 3.4  Carry    out    major    cleaning,    including    acid
cleaning  of  coil  and  associated  parts,  and  changing  of
seals on a periodic basis.  After cleaning, argon drying,
and vacuum pumping, perform a chamber and preheater
bakeout of at least 15 min.
12. 4  Ingot Growth
12. 4.1  Place  the  core  samples  and  seed  in  the  furnace
chamber so that both hang plumb and are centered and
aligned with the vertical axis of rotation.
12. 4.2  Remove  air  from  the  chamber  with  a  series  of
evacuation  and  argon  purge  cycles.    Fill  the  chamber
with argon and continue the argon purge throughout the
growth  cycle,  maintaining  a  positive  pressure  of  argon
in the chamber.
12. 4.3  Position  the  seed  end  of  the  core  sample  in  the
coil, and the preheater close to the seed end of the core.
Adjust the preheater power to make the initial induction
coupling of the preheater and sample, and heat until the
sample begins to glow, about 600 to 700°C.  Move the
preheater  away  from  the  sample  and  move  the  core
sample  close  to  the  coil  opening  to  establish  a  molten
zone controlled by power to the coil.
12. 4.4  After  a  small  molten  zone  has  been  established
at the seed end, move the seed vertically until it touches
the  molten  zone.    Withdraw  the  seed  to  form  a  conical
melt, making sure the seed has melted in, and begin the
necking  phase  in  order  to  form  a  zero  dislocation
crystal.
12. 4.5  Adjust  top  and  bottom  travel  and  rotation  rates
to  complete  the  necking  phase,  check  for  the  three-
growth  facet  lines  to  ensure  the  ingot  is  single  crystal,
and  adjust  travel  and  power  level  to  form  the  final
diameter  of  the  ingot.    Adjust  the  travel  and  rotations
and grow a single crystal zero dislocation ingot.
12. 4.6  When the desired ingot length has been attained,
pull the ingot from the melt, making sure the ingot and
melt   separate   without   freezing.      After   separation,
reduce  power,  stop  all  travels  and  rotation,  turn  off
power, and allow to cool.
12. 5  Ingot Evaluation
12. 5.1  Visual   Examination   —   Examine   the   ingot
visually    for    uniformity    of    diameter,    continuous
uniform-growth   facet   line,   and   color,   to   determine
whether  the  ingot  is  zero  dislocation  single  crystal  and
whether  oxide  deposits  are  present  as  a  result  of  air
leaks.
12. 5.2  Structural and Electrical Examination
12. 5.2.1  Determine  crystallographic  orientation  in  ac-
cordance  with  SEMI  MF26  on  a  sampling  basis  to
confirm the visual examination.
12. 5.2.2  Determine  the  crystallographic  perfection  of
the grown ingot in accordance with SEMI MF1725 on a
sampling basis to confirm the visual examination.
12. 5.2.3  Test       for       uniform       distribution       of
acceptor/donor   impurities   by   plotting   a   resistivity
profile along the length of the ingot in accordance with
SEMI MF397.  Note that resistivity values should vary
along  the  length  consistent  with  the  net  acceptor/donor
values  measured  at  the  various  points  and  that  sharp
changes  in  the  profile  indicate  point  contamination  or
nonuniformity of the sample deposition layer.
12. 6  Ingot Sampling
12. 6.1  After  the  ingot  is  inspected  for  crystallographic
perfection,  appearance,  and  uniformity,  and  judged  to
