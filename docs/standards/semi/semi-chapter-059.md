SEMI E109-0305 © SEMI 2001, 200511 10.2.2 From the host point of view, an object is instantiated if the host is able to query the equipment about thatobject, its current state, and other attributes. Once instantiated, the object is considered destroyed (no longerinstantiated) if the response to such queries is unknown object.10.2.3 Summary of reticle pod object instantiation:1. Bind, ReticleTransferJob, or PodNotification Service;2. PodID read with no currently existing pod objects having the PodID just read; and3. ProceedWithPod or CancelPod Service on an UNASSOCIATED port with a pod.10.2.4 Reticle Pod Object Identifier (ObjID)10.2.4.1 The purpose of an Object Identifier is to allow references to an object within the system. The objectidentifier is created when an object is instantiated and should be unchanged or persistent until the end of the objectlifecycle. The Object Identifier shall be unique at the equipment during lifecycle of the object. The PodID is theReticle Pod Object Identifier. The equipment is responsible for ensuring uniqueness of the PodID prior toinstantiation by the bind, pod notification, or ReticleTransferJob service.10.2.5 Reticle Pod Object Destruction10.2.5.1 Normally, the Reticle Pod Object reaches the end of its lifecycle when the reticle pod is unloaded from theequipment. Abnormally, the Reticle Pod Object reaches the end of its lifecycle when a CancelBind,CancelReticleTransferJob, or CancelPodNotification service is executed prior to the reticle pod being loaded, orwhen an equipment based pod verification fails following pod instantiation by the bind service.10.2.5.2 Summary of reticle pod object destruction:1. A reticle pod is unloaded from the equipment;2. A CancelBind, CancelReticleTransferJob or CancelPodNotification service is received; and3. An equipment based verification fails (after the object has been instantiated via the bind services).10.3 Reticle Pod Attribute Definitions10.3.1 The following table contains the attributes that are of importance to the host and/or the equipment in order tomanage the history and the reports about the reticle pod object.10.3.2 REQD Column10.3.2.1 All attributes in the following table are required to be associated with the reticle pod object. However onlythe attributes marked with a Y in the REQD column are always required to be maintained and updated by theequipment. The attributes marked with an N in the REQD column are only required to be maintained if they areprovided by the host by either the Bind, PodNotification, ReticleTransferJob or ProceedWithPod Services or if theequipment has means of determining the attribute values. (For example, if the equipment has a ReticleID reader, theequipment can determine the ContentMap).10.3.3 ACCESS Column10.3.3.1 Even though a value may be marked as RO (read only), the initial value for the attribute may be providedby the host when attached to either the Bind, PodNotification, ReticleTransferJob or ProceedWithPod services. Theonly other time the PodCapacityStatus attributes are updated is at the first ProceedWithPod service.10.3.4 Pod Attribute Definition TableTable 6 Pod Attribute Definition Attribute Name Definition Access Reqd FormObjType Object type. RO Y Text equal to Reticle Pod.ObjID Object identifier. RO Y Text 1 to 80 characters equal to the PodID.Capacity Maximum number of reticles inpod.RO Y Positive integer. If a pod arrives at a load portwith no warning the default value is one.

All otherattributes, such as LocationID, shall be set and maintained by the equipment. The attributes, Capacity, ContentMap, Reticle count, shall be provided with Bind, PodNotification,ReticleTransferJob, or ProceedWithPod service before or when SlotMap is provided. The SlotMap shall be provided with Bind, PodNotification, ReticleTransferJob or ProceedWithPod to verifyPodID, when the SlotMap verification is equipment based. And it shall not be provided when the SlotMapverification is host based. Reticle pod properties may be provided before the reticle pod arrives as part of the Bind, PodNotification, orReticleTransferJob service and should be retained until either a CancelBind, CancelPodNotification, orCancelReticleTransferJob service is received or the reticle pod is removed. Reticle pod properties may also be provided by the ProceedWithPod service. The reticle pod properties that areprovided by the ProceedWithPod service may differ based whether or not the object is instantiated by theservice.

SEMI E109-0305 © SEMI 2001, 200513  Reticle pod properties that are required shall be actively updated by the equipment.10.3.6 Reticle Pod Location10.3.6.1 A reticle pod location, signified by LocationID, is used for tracking. A reticle pod location is any physicalarea that is capable of holding a pod. It is not intended to represent entire mechanisms, which may have a variety ofother properties of interest, but only that portion where a reticle pod may rest.10.3.7 Reticle Pod Location Examples10.3.7.1 Reticle Pod Locations include reticle pod load port locations, internal pod buffer locations, as well asgrippers, conveyors, and elevators that are used internally for moving the pod from one fixed location to another.10.3.8 Slot Map Relation to Content Map  The slot map attribute and content map attribute hold similarinformation. The purpose of these attributes differs. The slot map is provided so that the equipment or host canquickly verify that the pod has reticles correctly placed in the correct slot (as provided by the host). This verificationis based on a slot map read. The content map is provided so that the host can communicate the specific ReticleID ina specific slot as delivered and that the equipment can communicate the specific ReticleID that it places in a specificslot.10.3.9 Reticle Pod Location Naming  All locations shall be assigned a unique name. Information about thereticle pod location can be obtained by querying the Pod Object for the ReticlePodLocationID or by asking theequipment for the PodLocationMatrix. The text form of the ReticlePodLocationID shall be descriptive of thelocation.10.3.10 Capacity10.3.10.1 The Capacity parameter can be sent to the equipment by the host in the PodNotification, Bind,ReticleTransferJob, or the ProceedWithPod service. However the equipment shall update this10.3.10.2 Parameter based on the results of the read slot map operation. Furthermore, the equipment shall updatethe parameter based on its own actions. If the equipment does not know the value of Capacity prior to instantiation,the equipment shall instantiate the reticle pod object with the value of one for Capacity.10.3.11 The ReticlePodAccessing10.3.11.1 Status is used by the host to know whether or not the reticle pod owned by the equipment can betransferred from the equipment.10.3.11.2 Enumerated values of ReticlePodAccessing-Status correspond to the substates ofReticlePodAccessingStatus (see Figure 2).10.4 Reticle Pod State Model10.4.1 The purpose of the Reticle Pod State Model is to define the hosts view of a reticle pod. The equipment shallmaintain a separate and independent state model for each reticle pod in/at the equipment.10.4.2 Reticle Pod State Model Diagram10.4.3 Reticle Pod State Definitions10.4.3.1 RETICLE POD  The RETICLE POD state has four ANDed (orthogonal) substates: RETICLE POD IDSTATUS, RETICLE POD SLOT MAP STATUS, RETICLE POD ACCESSING STATUS, AND RETICLE PODCLAMPING STATUS.10.4.3.1.1 RETICLE POD ACCESSING STATUS  This is a substate of RETICLE POD and indicates the currentaccessing status of the pod. It has three substates, NOT ACCESSED, IN ACCESS, and COMPLETE. The initialdefault entry substate is NOT ACCESSED.10.4.3.1.1.1 NOT ACCESSED  This is a substate of RETICLE POD ACCESSING STATUS and is active whenthe reticle pod has not been opened. It has two substates NOT AVAILABLE and AVAILABLE.10.4.3.1.1.1.1 NOT AVAILABLE This is a substate of NOT ACCESSED and is active when the reticle pod has beeninstantiated via service but has not been received by the equipment.

It has four substates, ID NOT READ, WAITING FOR HOST ON IDSTATUS, ID VERIFICATION FAILED, ID VERIFICATION OK. The initial substate is conditional based oninformation the equipment has about the reticle pod. When the PodID is provided by the Bind, ReticleTransferJob,or the PodNotification service, the reticle pod object shall be instantiated in the ID NOT READ substate. When thePodID is provided by the PodID read, the reticle pod shall be instantiated in the WAITING FOR HOST ON IDSTATUS substate. When the Reticle Pod is instantiated by the ProceedWithPod service, the reticle pod shall beinstantiated in the ID VERIFICATION OK substate. Finally when the reticle pod is instantiated by the CancelPodservice, the pod will be instantiated in the ID VERIFICATION FAILED substate.10.4.3.1.3.1 ID NOT READ  This is a substate of RETICLE POD ID STATUS. This state is active whenever thePodID has not been read by the equipment.10.4.3.1.3.2 ID VERIFICATION FAILED  This is a substate of RETICLE POD ID STATUS and is active whenthe PodID has verification by the host with the CancelPod service. This is a final state.10.4.3.1.3.3 ID VERIFICATION OK  This is a substate of RETICLE POD ID STATUS and is active as soon asthe PodID has been accepted. The ID is determined to be accepted by either successful verification by theequipment or the host, or by bypassing ID read because a PodID reader is not available and the BypassReadIDvariable is set to true. This is a final state.10.4.3.1.3.4 WAITING FOR HOST ON ID STATUS  This is a substate of RETICLE POD ID STATUS and isactive during the period of time when the PodID has been read by the equipment successfully or unsuccessfully andhas not yet been verified.10.4.3.1.4 RETICLE POD SLOT MAP STATUS  This is a substate of RETICLE POD and indicates the currentstatus of the reticle pod with respect to its slot map. It has four substates, SLOT MAP NOT READ, WAITINGFOR HOST ON SLOT MAP STATUS, SLOT MAP VERIFICATION FAILED, SLOT MAP VERIFICATION OK.The initial default entry sub-state is SLOT MAP NOT READ.10.4.3.1.4.1 SLOT MAP NOT READ  This is a substate of RETICLE POD SLOT MAP STATUS and is thedefault entry state. It is active when the Reticle Pod is first loaded at the equipment until the Slot Map has been readsuccessfully by the equipment.10.4.3.1.4.2 SLOT MAP VERIFICATION FAIL  This is a substate of RETICLE POD SLOT MAP STATUS andis active when the Slot Map has been read by the equipment and has failed verification by the host. This is a finalstate.10.4.3.1.4.3 SLOT MAP VERIFICATION OK  This is a substate of RETICLE POD SLOT MAP STATUS and isactive as soon as the slot map has been verified. This is a final state.10.4.3.1.4.4 WAITING FOR HOST ON SLOT MAP STATUS  This is a substate of RETICLE POD SLOT MAPSTATUS and is active when the equipment is waiting for input from the host.

LOCKED Data required to be available forthis event report:PodIDPortID#1 Only one collection event report is required when entering the Reticle Pod State Model (instantiating a reticle pod object). This event reportshall include the entry state of the all the substates of Reticle Pod State Model, (including RETICLE POD ID STATUS substate, the RETICLEPOD SLOT MAP STATUS substate, the RETICLE POD ACCESSING STATUS, and the RETICLE POD LOCKING STATUS). 10.4.5 Slot Map Read Details10.4.5.1 The Slot Map shall be read on all production equipment prior to removal of reticles from the reticle pod.10.4.6 Pod Read Failure  A pod read failure occurs when the PodID reader is present, in service, and reports thatit is unable to read the ID of a pod. This represents a transient random failure rather than a steady condition.10.4.7 Bypass Read ID  A PodID reader may be unavailable: either out of service, not installed, or otherwisemalfunctioning and unable to execute a read operation. This represents a steady condition that often is known inadvance. The equipment shall provide a user-configurable variable BypassReadID that the user is able to set tospecify the action to take when a pod is received to an ASSOCIATED load port. In this case, the reticle pod objectis instantiated in the ID NOT READ state, and when the reticle pod is received, the state model transitions to eitherWAITING FOR HOST or ID VERIFICATION OK, depending upon whether BypassReadID is FALSE (the defaultvalue) or TRUE. When TRUE, then the PodID received in the Bind is used automatically. Otherwise, the podtransitions to WAITING FOR HOST and waits for the host to send a ProceedWithPod. The ID used will be the IDincluded with the ProceedWithPod. 11 Access Mode11.1 Access Mode State Model11.1.1 The Access Mode State Model defines the host view of equipment access mode, as well as the hostinteractions with the equipment necessary to switch the access mode. Each Reticle Load Port has its own AccessMode State Model. There are two access mode states. These are defined in 11.3.3.11.1.2 The access mode for a reticle pod load port may be switched at anytime by the host or the operator, exceptwhen the Reticle Load Port Reservation State Model for that Reticle Pod Load Port is in the RESERVED state orduring reticle pod transfer. Reticle pod transfer boundaries, for determining when access mode may be changed, aredesignated by Table 8, Reticle Pod Transfer Boundaries.

They enable the host to inform the equipment of a future reticle pod delivery without specifying the reticlePodID and at the same time allow host based verification. (Equipment based verification is enabled via theLoad Port/Pod Association State Model, the Bind service, ReticleTransferJob, and the PodNotification servicedetailed in 13, 18.4.2, 18.5.19, and 18.4.11.)2. They enable the equipment to send a state change event to the host if the operator (either local or remote)informs the equipment of a future pod delivery to a reticle load port without specifying the reticle PodID.

If the Reticle Load Port Reservation State Model is in the NOTRESERVED state, the Bind or ReticleTransferJob service triggers a transition to the RESERVED state. If theReticle Load Port Reservation is in the RESERVED State, the CancelBind or CancelReticleTranserJob servicetriggers a transition to NOT RESERVED.12.1.2 For Lithography, reticle inspection, and bare reticle stocker equipment, the Reservation State Model, theReserveAtPort service, the CancelReserveAtPort service, and all other associated functionality is a user option andnot necessary for fundamental compliance.12.1.3 For equipment implementing the reservation state model, the equipment shall provide a reticle load portreservation state model for each load port.12.2 Reservation Visible Signal12.2.1 When a port reservation has taken place, the equipment shall display a visible signal indicating that thedesignated load port is in the Reserved State. Examples of visible signals for the associated load port are: BlinkingLEDs, flags, color indicators, or other methods that allow easy recognition that the load port is reserved; proximityto or location on the load port is recommended. The visible signal shall remain present as long as the load port stateremains RESERVED. When the state changes to NOT RESERVED the visible indicator shall cease. Thiscapability is not required for fundamental compliance to RPMS.12.3 Load Port Reservation State Model Diagram NOTRESERVED RESERVED 2 3 1 Reticle Load PortReservation Figure 4Reticle Load Port Reservation State Model Diagram 12.4 Reticle Load Port Reservation State Definitions12.4.1 RETICLE LOAD PORT RESERVATION  The super state of the substates NOT RESERVED andRESERVED.12.4.2 NOT RESERVED  A substate of LOAD PORT RESERVATION, this state is active when there is noreservation existing at the load port.12.4.3 RESERVED  A substate of LOADPORT RESERVATION, this state is active when there is a reservationfor future activity at the load port.

SEMI E109-0305 © SEMI 2001, 200525 13 Reticle Pod Load Port/Pod Association State Model13.1 The purpose of the Reticle Pod Association State Model is to define the host view of pod to reticle load portassociation of the production equipment, as well as the host interactions with the production equipment necessary toassociate a reticle pod to a reticle load port, and to perform equipment based pod verification. Each reticle load portshall maintain an independent instance of the Pod Association State Model. Each instance of this state model mustnot influence the state of the same state model for a different reticle load port.13.1.1 This state model provides the ability to perform PodID verification with two different methods. If the PodIDis provided before the equipment reads the PodID, the PodID that becomes associated with the reticle load port canbe used later for equipment based pod verification. If the association happens by PodID read (not by a serviceexecution), then the production equipment shall report the PodID information in a data collection event.13.2 Reticle Pod Load Port/Pod Association State Model Diagram NOTASSOCIATED ASSOCIATED 2 3 1 RETICLE POD LOAD PORT/ PODASSOCIATION 4 Figure 6Reticle Pod Load Port/Pod Association State Model Diagram 13.2.1 Reticle Pod Load Port/Pod Association State Definitions13.2.1.1 RETICLE POD LOAD PORT/POD ASSOCIATION  The parent state of the NOT ASSOCIATED andASSOCIATED sub-states.13.2.1.2 NOT ASSOCIATED  A sub-state of RETICLE POD LOAD PORT/POD ASSOCIATION.

This transition only occurswhen the Bind orReticleTransferJobcommand has been used.Data required to be availablefor this event report:PortIDPodID 14 Reticle Object14.1 Information about a reticle is encapsulated as an object. This allows the host to exchange information with theequipment about one or more specific reticle using services defined in SEMI E39, Object Services Standard. Areticle has properties (attributes) that are defined in Table 12, Reticle Attribute Definition.14.2 Object Instantiation14.2.1 The reticle object is a software representation of the reticle in the equipment. Under normal circumstancesthis object is instantiated by the equipment when the host uses the Bind, ReticleTransferJob, PodNotification,ProceedWithPod service (when it included the content map attribute), MoveReticle service, when the equipment

&lt;!-- Page 17 --&gt;

SEMI E109-0305 © SEMI 2001, 200527 successfully reads the ReticleID from the reticle pod tag, or when the equipment successfully reads the ReticleIDfrom the reticle itself. A reticle is instantiated by reticle pod tag read or ReticleID read only if there are no currentlyexisting objects with the ReticleID just read. A reticle object can also be instantiated by either the ProceedWithPodor CancelPod Services when these services contain the content map. A Reticle can be instantiated by theMoveReticle Service if the ReticleID(s) provided by the service have not been previously instantiated.14.2.2 From the host point of view, an object is instantiated if the host is able to query the equipment about thatobject, it's current state, and other attributes. Once instantiated, the object is considered destroyed (no longerinstantiated) if the response to such queries is unknown object.14.2.3 Summary of possible reticle object instantiation methods:1. Bind, ReticleTransferJob, or PodNotification Service that contains the content map attribute;2. PodID tag read containing the content map with no currently existing reticle objects having the ReticleID justread from the pod tag;3. ReticleID read with no currently existing reticle objects having the ReticleID just read from the ReticleID read;4. ProceedWithPod or CancelPod Service containing the content map attribute; and5. MoveReticle Service when the reticle is not previously instantiated.14.2.4 Reticle Object Identifier (ObjID)14.2.4.1 The purpose of an Object Identifier is to allow references to an object within the system. The objectidentifier is created when an object is instantiated and should be unchanged or persistent until the end of the objectlifecycle. The Object Identifier shall be unique at the equipment during lifecycle of the object. The ReticleID is theReticle Object Identifier. The equipment is responsible for ensuring uniqueness of the ReticleID prior toinstantiation by the bind, PodNotification, ReticleTransferJob, or MoveReticle service.14.2.5 Reticle Object Destruction14.2.5.1 Normally, the Reticle Object reaches the end of its lifecycle when the reticle pod containing the reticle isunloaded from the equipment. Abnormally, the Reticle Object reaches the end of its lifecycle when a CancelBind,CancelReticleTransferJob, or CancelPodNotification service (if the original Bind, ReticleTransferJob, orPodNotification service contained the contentmap) is executed prior to the reticle pod being loaded, when aCancelMoveReticle service is executed prior to reticle removal from the reticle pod (if the reticle was instantiatedusing the MoveReticle command), when an equipment based pod verification fails following reticle pod and reticleinstantiation by the bind service, ReticleTransferJob, or reticle pod tag read.14.2.5.2 Summary of reticle object destruction:1. A reticle pod is unloaded from the equipment;2. A CancelBind, CancelReticleTransferJob, or CancelPodNotification service that contained the content map isreceived;3. An equipment based verification fails (after the object has been instantiated via the bind, ReticleTransferJobservice, or reticle pod tag read);4. A CancelMoveReticle service is executed prior to reticle removal from the reticle pod (when the content maphas not been provided by other service or reticle pod tag read); and5. Manual removal of the physical reticle.14.3 Reticle Attribute Definitions14.3.1 The following table contains the attributes that are of importance to the host and/or the equipment in order tomanage the history and the reports about the reticle object.14.3.2 REQD Column14.3.2.1 All attributes in the following table are required to be associated with the reticle object. However only theattributes marked with a Y in the REQD column are always required to be maintained and updated by theequipment. The attributes marked with an N in the REQD column are only required to be maintained if they are

SEMI E109-0305 © SEMI 2001, 2005 40 16 Reticle Pod Release Control16.1 For equipment, where Pod Read/Write technology is used and the Host initiates writing, the reticle pod orreticle cassette must remain at the write position where the tag may be accurately written on until the Host hascompleted its entire read and write operations. For this purpose, a variable that affects the equipment releasing apod is defined.16.2 Pod Hold Trigger  Equipment shall allow the user to select a trigger to release the carrier pod whenreading/writing is complete. Release does not mean the equipment must move the pod from the location it currentlyoccupies, only that it is permissible to do so.16.2.1 Pod Hold Trigger set to Host Release  If the Pod Hold trigger is set to Host Release, equipment shall holdthe pod at the write position until the PodRelease service is received.16.2.2 PodHold Trigger set to Equipment Release  If the Pod Hold trigger is set to Equipment Release, theequipment shall release the reticle pod based on the when the equipment has finished removing all reticles from thepod, finished placing all reticles in the pod, and in the case where the equipment initiates writing until the equipmenthas finished writing.16.3 Fixed Buffer Equipment shall allow the user to select a trigger to unclamp the reticle pod based on AMHSarrival at the equipment. If the access mode is MANUAL, the unclamp control trigger has no effect.16.3.1 UnclampControl trigger set to PODCOMPLETE Triggered Unclamp  The equipment automaticallyunclamps the reticle pod when the reticle pod status is COMPLETE.16.3.2 UnclampControl trigger set to AMHS Triggered Unclamp  The equipment behavior depends upon theReticle Load Port Access State. If the Reticle Pod Load port Access State is AUTO, the reticle pod remainsclamped until AMHS has arrived. The AMHS arrives and begins a PIO unload sequence. 17 Reticle Location Object Definition17.1 A Reticle Location Object (RLO) provides a model for identifying reticle locations. Each RLO on anequipment is assigned a reticle location ID to uniquely identify it. The assignment shall be documented by theequipment supplier. There are two types of substrate locations: reticle pod reticle location, which is the location orposition (e.g., slot) in the reticle pod, and equipment reticle location, which is on the equipment resource. Theequipment reticle location is a persistent object, while the reticle pod reticle locations are dynamic objects that shallbe created or deleted by the placement or removal of reticle pods on the equipment. The intent is to follow E90 inregards to location object management. The reticle location object is a subtype of the substrate location object.17.1.1 Source reticle locations and Destination reticle locations are the points at which reticles transfer to/from theequipments internal reticle locations (often locations at which processing occurs). A reticle pod reticle location isthe Source or Destination reticle location when a pod is used to transfer the reticle. An equipment reticle locationcan be the Source or Destination reticle location when the reticle is transferred directly (without a pod).17.2 Reticle Location State Model  Figure 9 below shows the dynamic behavior of the reticle location using theHarel state chart representation. © UNOCCUPIED OCCUPIED RETICLE LOCATION 1 2 Figure 9Reticle Location State Model Diagram

When using host based verification, the productionequipment shall move the pod in to the internal buffer for the first time after receiving the ProceedWithPod request.If the PodIn service is received by the production equipment without previously having received a PodOut servicefor the carrier, the service will be refused.Table 47 PodIn Service Parameter Definitions Parameter Name Req/Ind Rsp/Conf DescriptionPodID M  The CarrierID for the carrier to internalize.CMStatus  M Information concerning the result of the service. 18.5.13 PodOut  The PodOut service is sent to internal buffer production equipment, to request that theequipment move the specified carrier to a load port, as soon as the carrier is completed. When the CarrierOutservice is started, the destination load port state becomes TRANSFER BLOCKED, and the load ports associationstate becomes ASSOCIATED.18.5.13.1 PodOut Queuing18.5.13.1.1 This service request can be queued by the production equipment. The production equipment is requiredto support a queue of n size, where n is equal to the sum of the number of internal buffer locations and the number ofinternal FIMS ports. The order of the queue is FIFO for each load port. If the load port is not specified in servicerequest, the equipment chooses which load port queue to place the PodOut service. The queued service does nottake effect until the current substrate handling action is complete (i.e., filling, emptying of the pod) and the load portis in the NOT ASSOCIATED state. When a PodOut service is queued and the production equipment load port iscurrently in the TRANSFER BLOCKED state, the production equipment shall keep the load port in the TRANSFERBLOCKED state. Then, after the port is cleared, the PodOut service shall begin.Table 48 PodOut Service Parameter Definitions Parameter Name Req/Ind Rsp/Conf DescriptionPodID M  PodID for the carrier to be moved out.

The equipment should create anassociation between the reticle pod and reticle load port. The equipment should transition the load port reservationstate model to RESERVED. The ReticleTransferJob service is also used by the host to inform the equipment whichreticles contained in the reticle pod should be removed and placed in the equipment. Lastly the ReticleTransferJobservice is used by the host to inform the equipment which reticles contained in the equipment should be removedfrom the equipment and placed in the reticle pod.

It is used to instruct equipment to disengage the independentclamping mechanism. It is used by the host when macro instructions such as provided by Bind, PodNotification,ProceedWithPod and ReticleTransferJob have not been provided by the host.Table 55 Unclamp Service Parameter Definitions Parameter Name Req/Ind Rsp/Conf DescriptionPodID C  The PodID of the pod to unclamp. Either the PodID or the PortID mustbe specified.PortID C  The PortID for which to unclamp a carrier. Either the PodID or thePortID must be specified.CMStatus  M Information concerning the result of the service. 19 Pod Tag Read/Write19.1 Some technologies allow data to be stored on a PodID tag where it can be subsequently read and/or modified.In one case the equipment can write information to the PodID tag. For example, the equipment will have knowledgeof the ReticleID of a reticle placed in a pod. At this time the equipment may write the ReticleID on the PodID tag.In another case, it is the host that specifies when this data is written and read, because the equipment has noknowledge of the contents of the data. The read operations shall be performed only when the pod is at the readposition. The write operations shall be performed only when the pod is at the write position.NOTE 2: The read and write positions may be the same position. The host shall be able to both read and write wheneverPodHold switch is set to Host Release and the pod is at the respective read or write position. Once the host has completed all ofits read and write operations for that pod, then the host sends the PodRelease request to the equipment. The PodRelease serviceinforms the equipment that pod read or pod write is complete. The PodRelease service has a different purpose from the PodOutservice. The intent of the PodOut service request is to move the pod to a load port, while the intent of the PodRelease servicerequest is to inform equipment that it may move the pod away from the read or write position. Therefore, PodOut may also beused with the PodRelease command. If PodHold is Host Release, then the pod shall be kept at the write position until anPodRelease service request is received, regardless of when a PodOut is sent. If PodHold is set to Equipment Release, then thePodRelease request has no effect. 20 Additional Events20.1 This section identifies data collection events that are not related to State transitions for variable data items.The intent of this section is to ensure certain data is available for specific events that are not related to statetransitions, not to define all the additional collection events for RPMS. Also, all state transitions in RPMS statemodels are required to have associated event reports.20.2 Buffer Capacity Changed Event20.2.1 An event shall be generated whenever Buffer Capacity changes. This applies to all internal buffers andinternal buffer partitions.
