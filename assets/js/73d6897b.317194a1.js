Current edition approved by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on August 15, 1998. Initially available at ",(0,a.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.semi.org"},"www.semi.org")," January 1999; to be publishedFebruary 1999. Originally published September 1998.This document replaces E76-0998 in its entirety. 1 Purpose1.1 Factory design variations make it difficult forequipment manufacturers to predict or agree onconsistent points of connection for hookup of equipmentto facility services. Similarly, device manufacturerscannot easily pre-facilitate their factories for equipmentbecause the connections on the equipment are notconsistently located. Standardization of connectionlocations and utilizing pre-facilitation strategiesdecreases the cost of and time required for equipmentinstallation.1.2 This document is a guide for 300 mm equipmentmanufacturers to define the positioning of theequipment points of connection (EPOC), required onsemiconductor processing equipment for hookup tofacility utility services. The document identifieslocations for the EPOCs and provides EPOCconsistency recommendations that should allow forefficient equipment installation. In addition, thisdocument defines strategies to support the devicemanufacturers ability to pre-facilitate the utility pointof connection (UPOC). Recommendations for supplier-provided EPOC documentation are also included. 2 Scope2.1 This guide addresses three areas that are necessaryto improve the efficiency of and reduce the duration ofequipment installations.a) Recommendations for EPOC location, grouping,consistency and reduction to increase confidence inthe accuracy and repeatability of EPOCs, andreduce the amount of work required to hookupequipment. As a result, device manufacturers canemploy standard pre-facilitation strategies andincrease the efficiency of equipment installation.b) Pre-facilitation recommendations that provide theability for UPOCs to be efficiently and accuratelyinstalled prior to equipment delivery, thus allowingimmediate hook-up of the equipment upon arrivalin the wafer fab. This includes recommendations for jigs, templates, mating pedestal bases, andassociated interface panels.c) Documentation recommendations to be required bythe device manufacturer and provided by theequipment supplier relative to EPOC location,group, consistency, pre-facilitation strategies andhardware. This includes additional documentationrecommended to support equipment installationsbut not directly related to EPOCs.2.2 This guide applies to 300 mm semiconductorprocessing equipment and any supplier-providedsupport equipment for installation into new factories.2.3 The following groups of utilities are covered in thisguide. Electrical Power Data communications Exhaust and other process effluents Process fluids (liquids and gases) Support equipment interconnects2.4 The primary focus for this guide is hookup ofsemiconductor processing equipment including but notlimited to the following equipment types.

The locations noted apply to all equipmenttypes, as listed in the document scope, and allequipment configurations including but not limited toboxed equipment, linked equipment, and clusterequipment.6.1.2 Bottom Location Plane: Facility services aretypically provided from the subfab below the waffleslab. The bottom location of EPOCs allows for straightup routing of supply lines, thus reducing equipmentfootprint and easing facilitation. The locations ofEPOCs need to be readily accessible to facilitate hook-up to the UPOC (i.e., accessible from the back or sides).(See Table 1.)6.1.3 Back Location Plane: If the bottom locationplane option is not utilized for hookup, EPOCs shouldbe on back plane of equipment just above the raisedfloor. (See Table 1.)6.2 Equipment Point of Connection Groups6.2.1 Equipment points of connection should begrouped together by service type to ensure ease ofhookup and qualification of the equipment. Thefollowing groups should be considered during theconfiguration of the equipment.a) Electrical Power Connections  Includes butis not limited to connections for main electricalutility power supply. b) Data Communications Connections Includes but is not limited to factory systems,automated material handling system, andsupport equipment communication cables andinterface connectors.c) Gas Delivery System Connections  Includesbut is not limited to fittings for bulk andspecialty gas lines.d) Liquid Delivery System Connections Includes but is not limited to fittings for liquidchemical, slurry, ultra pure water, processcooling water, temperature control unit fluids,and industrial water lines.e) Equipment Effluent Connections  Includesbut is not limited to fittings for exhaust, drain,and vacuum lines.f) Life and Safety System Connections Includes but is not limited to fire protection,leak detection, emergency machine off (EMO),and hazard warning systems.6.2.2 A hierarchy should be adhered to when locatingthese groups of connections on equipment. Datacommunication wiring should be routed separately frompower wiring and connections. Radio frequency (RF)interconnects should be routed and grouped separately.All electrical and electronic wiring should be away fromand above water and drain lines.6.3 Equipment Point of Connection Consistency6.3.1 This section provides key elements to ensure therequired consistency of the equipment points ofconnection. Connection locations on the equipment"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 25 --",">"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E76-0299  SEMI 1998, 19995 should be consistent with those defined in the FacilitiesInterface Specification and should not deviate fromequipment to equipment of a specific model andrevision. EPOC tolerances need to be +/- 6.35 mm (+/-1/4 inch) in all directions as measured from the supplierdefined equipment datum point. Tighter tolerancesshould be considered for inflexible or difficult to movehookups such as large diameter (over 2 inch) exhaust orwater lines. Connector sizes and types should matchexactly.6.3.2 Table 2 - EPOC Consistency Recommendationsidentify equipment variations and levels of consistencyrequired for equipment points of connection location,connector type and size.6.3.3 In Table 2, the term Should Match identifiesareas that have traditionally been the most costly andwhere significant gains can be made in achievinginstallation efficiency . The term Could Matchidentifies areas where modest gains can be made ininstallation efficiency .6.4 Equipment Point of Connection Reduction6.4.1 The number of connection points to theequipment should be kept to a minimum. The EPOCslocated on wafer processing equipment should follow astrategy commonly referred to as single line drops,where there is only one point of connection per serviceper piece of equipment. Where feasible, distribution ofa particular facility (e.g., chilled water, waste drains forthe same type of chemicals) should be distributedthrough internal manifolding. Internal equipmentmanifolding should be configured to allow forconfigurable equipment sub-systems like processchambers and gas panels. In addition to manifolding, allother interface box functions should be configured on-board the equipment this includes any required shut-offvalves, regulators, filters, QC sample valves andpressure indicators.6.5 Equipment Point of Connection Interface Panel6.5.1 Once EPOC locations and groupings have beendefined and standardized for purposes of consistency,the supplier could utilize an interface panel concept forsimplifying equipment hook-up. The interface panelshould consist of a physical panel that becomes part ofthe permanent equipment installation. All EPOCsshould be comprehended in the layout of the interfacepanel using the recommendations for location,grouping, and consistency as discussed in Sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3. The supplier should design a standardinterface panel layout that supports a given equipmenttype and all associated revisions.6.5.2 Common connector technologies, types, andsizes should be utilized along with provisions forcontainment of hazardous materials. Typically,hazardous production material connections arecontained within the equipment6.5.3 Spacing of multiple gas and liquid connectionson the interface panel should provide sufficient accessand spacing for installation and maintenance formultiple lines (i.e., orbital weld head, wrench, and testfittings). 7 Pre-facilitation Recommendations7.1 The pre-facilitation strategy should provide thedevice manufacturer with the ability to efficiently andaccurately install UPOCs prior to equipment delivery,allowing immediate hook-up of the equipment uponarrival to the fab. The equipment supplier shouldprovide a template and/or jig, as well as a EPOCinterface panel (if applicable) or pre-facilitationpedestal prior to the equipment delivery as part of astrategy to support accurate pre-facilitation of utilitypoints of connection. In situations where a pedestal isbeing utilized (see Section 7.4), the pedestal can serveas an aide to pre-facilitation. The supplier and devicemanufacturer should discuss and agree on the chosenstrategy.7.2 Templates: The template provides a two-dimensional guide that projects EPOC locations to atwo-dimensional surface, typically the floor. This wouldallow the device manufacturer to open popouts, coreholes, etc., and pre-facilitate to a point close to, but notnecessarily including, the UPOC. See Figure 1 for arepresentative example of a Template.7.3 Jigs: The jig provides a guide that locates the -EPOCs in three-dimensional space. This would allowthe device manufacturer to pre-facilitate to the UPOCsor at least prefabricate the facility lines and UPOCssuch that final hookup could be accomplishedimmediately after setting the equipment. See Figure 2for a representative example of a Jig.7.4 Pre-facilitation Pedestal: Application notes andthree representative examples of using pedestals tosupport pre-facilitation are included in the relatedinformation section at the end of this document."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 26 --",">"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E76-0299 SEMI 1998, 1999 6 Figure 1Template Example Figure 2Jig Example"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 27 --",">"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E76-0299  SEMI 1998, 19997 8 Documentation Recommendations8.1 Equipment suppliers should provide the followingdocumentation concerning equipment point ofconnections and/or template, jig, and pre-facilitationpedestal to the device manufacturers.

Oncethe equipment is set on this pre-facilitation pedestal,hookup is relatively quick and easy. When a pre-facilitation pedestal is used, both the devicemanufacturer and supplier should agree who is responsible for coordinating space utilization within thepedestal.R1-1.2 When pre-facilitation pedestals are used, thephysical location of the EPOCs and correspondingUPOCs can be determined by utilizing templates, jigs,and/or EPOC interface panels in conjunction with thepedestal. The facility utility lines can be prefabricatedand installed to the UPOCs prior to setting theequipment on the pre-facilitation pedestal. See FigureR1-1 for a representative example of a Pre-facilitationPedestal.R1-1.3 The pre-facilitation pedestal should be providedby the equipment supplier and standardized for aequipment type.

This data is reduced to quantify the relationshipbetween the flow measurement by the MFC on one gasto another gas.6.2 This method allows the user to determine theconversion factor between two gases for the MFC andto determine the onset of errors in the MFC calibrationdue to the conversion factor/function effects. 7 Interferences7.1 The accuracy rating of the measuring equipmentshall be superior to that of the D.U.T. Preferably themeasuring equipment will have an accuracy that is fourtimes better than the D.U.T. Calibration equipmentmust have a valid calibration certificate.7.2 Take care when using test instruments with aspecified accuracy expressed in percent of full scale.7.3 Installation effects on the flow should beminimized.

Originally published September 1998.1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this document is to minimize thenegative impact on productivity caused by static chargein semiconductor manufacturing environments. It is aguide for establishing electrostatic compatibility ofequipment used in semiconductor manufacturing.1.2 Electrostatic surface charge causes a number ofundesirable effects in semiconductor manufacturingenvironments. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) damagesboth products and reticles. ESD events also causeelectromagnetic interference (EMI), resulting inequipment malfunctions. Charged wafer and reticlesurfaces attract particles (electrostatic attraction orESA) and increase the defect rate. Charge on productscan also result in equipment malfunction or productbreakage. Operating problems and additional productdefects due to static charge can have a negative impacton the cost of ownership of semiconductormanufacturing equipment (refer to SEMI E35).1.3 An increasing amount of semiconductor productionis done in minienvironments or within the productionequipment. The majority of static related problemsoccur while the product is in its carriers, or beingtransferred from them, by the production equipment.1.4 Static control methods can be incorporated in theequipment design to reduce static charge to acceptablelevels. This guide will be used primarily by equipmentmanufacturers during the design of their equipment.There are test methods available (see Sections 6 and 7of this guide) to demonstrate the effectiveness of thestatic control methods. The end user will be able to usethe same test methods to verify compliance with anequipment purchase specification. 2 Scope2.1 The scope of this document is limited to methodsof measurement and a guide for the maximumrecommended level of static charge on: Product or reticles, Carriers, and  Parts of the input/exit ports of equipment andminienvironments.2.2 This document presents a matrix of maximumrecommended levels of static charge on products,reticles, carriers, and the input and exit ports ofproduction equipment or minienvironments. Thepurpose is to: Reduce product, reticle, and equipment damagedue to ESD, Reduce equipment lock-up problems due to ESDevents, and Reduce the attraction of particles to chargedsurfaces.2.3 This document references SEMI E43 and othermethods of measuring static charge. RelatedInformation 1 of this document contains a theoreticalinvestigation of electrostatic particle attraction, as wellas case histories from users and equipmentmanufacturers as to the static charge problemsencountered and how they were solved. A bibliographyof related technical papers is also included. RelatedInformation 2 describes static control methodscommonly used in semiconductor manufacturing.2.4 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Static Measurements  Measurements ofelectrostatic quantities such as charge, electric field,and voltage are difficult to make. The nature of theobject (insulator or conductor), its geometry, itssurroundings, and the measuring equipment itself, areonly a few of the factors affecting the accuracy of anelectrostatic measurement.3.1.1 Similarly, it is difficult to relate the measurementof an electrostatic quantity to its effect on products orequipment. For example, an ESD simulator produces astandardized discharge waveform when a capacitor is"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 44 --",">"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E78-1102 \xa9 SEMI 1998, 2002 2 discharged at a known voltage. This device is used toestablish the ESD damage threshold for semiconductorproducts, or the effect of ESD on equipment. While theamount of charge transferred is known (q = CV), themaximum current that results is not. There is noguarantee that the same amount of charge wouldproduce the same results if different values ofcapacitance and voltage were used.3.2 Location  The test methods and maximumrecommended levels of static charge on product,reticles, and carriers are meant to be applied at theinput/exit ports of production equipment, and whenpossible within the equipment. This document is notmeant to be applied in any way that affects the processwithin the equipment.3.3 Test Methods  The test methods referenced inthis document do not guarantee precise measurementsof static charge levels. The maximum static chargelevels recommended in this document have largetolerances. (See Section 15.1.)3.4 Static Charge Control  There are a variety ofstatic related issues in a semiconductor manufacturingenvironment. The issues are complex due to the widerange of electrostatic problems, and device orequipment sensitivities to these problems. This guidecontains general recommendations. Users of thisdocument are cautioned that specific static relatedproblems may require or allow different levels of staticcharge than are recommended in this document. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E10  Standard for Definition and Measurementof Equipment Reliability, Availability, andMaintainability (RAM)SEMI E33  Specification for SemiconductorManufacturing Facility Electromagnetic CompatibilitySEMI E35  Cost of Ownership for SemiconductorManufacturing Equipment MetricsSEMI E43  Guide for Measuring Static Charge onObjects and Surfaces4.2 ESD Association Standards and Advisories1 ESD STM5.1  Sensitivity Testing  Human BodyModel (HBM) - Component LevelESD ADV1.0  Glossary of Terms 1 ESD Association, 7900 Turin Road, Rome, NY 13440 ESD ADV 2.0  Advisory for Protection andSensitivity Testing of Electrostatic DischargeSusceptible Items - HandbookANSI/ESD STM5.3.1  Sensitivity Testing - ChargedDevice Model (CDM) - Component LevelANSI/ESD STM5.2  Sensitivity Testing -- MachineModel (MM) - Component Level4.3 Other DocumentsIEC/TS 61000-4-2  Transient Immunity Standard,International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)2 89/336/EEC  European Union Directive onElectromagnetic CompatibilityNOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 deposition velocity  Particle flux to a surface(number of particles deposited per unit area per unittime) divided by the particle concentration adjacent tothe surface boundary layer.5.1.2 electromagnetic interference (EMI)  Anyelectrical signal in the non-ionizing (sub-optical)portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with thepotential to cause an undesired response in electronicequipment.5.1.3 electrostatic attraction (ESA)  The forcebetween two or more oppositely charged objects.

The amount of static charge, thedistribution of static charge on an object, and the natureof the static discharge will all interact to determine ifthe charge level is safe. It will be difficult to determinelevels that guarantee static related problems are totallyeliminated. The goal of this guide is to assist the user inidentifying static charge levels likely to cause problemsin process equipment. This guide should provide theuser with enough insight to define a test methodologyfor each static problem and understand its limitations.6.2 ESD Damage6.2.1 When considering direct ESD damage to anobject (product, reticle, or equipment), the importantparameter is the current accompanying the chargetransfer to or from the object. Under a fixed set of testparameters, the damaging amount of current due to thecharge transfer to or from the object can be determined.Established test methods exist for determining thethreshold of damage to a particular object. ESD simulators of various types are used for this purpose.Refer to EOS/ESD Association Standards listed inSection 4 for further information concerning devicetesting.6.2.2 The end user should determine what is damagingcurrent level due to charge transfer to product orreticles that will be handled in a particular piece ofproduction equipment.6.2.3 In the context of production equipment, it appearsimportant to know the charge on the product, itscarriers, and any other objects that might directlycontact the product. Charge is measured in coulombs,or more conveniently in nanocoulombs (10-9 coulombs)for this purpose. The measurement is made withinstrumentation known as a Faraday Cup, as shown inSection 7, Figure 1.6.2.4 A charged object, like an integrated circuit, isplaced in the Faraday Cup and a reading is taken of thecharge on it. It will be necessary to obtain an instrumentwith a large enough cup for wafers, cassettes, andother equipment parts. It will also be necessary to getthe objects into the cup without altering their chargelevels. Further information on making thesemeasurements should be available from themanufacturers of the measuring equipment.6.2.5 The user should determine with an ESDsimulator what levels of ESD cause product, or reticledamage. The equipment manufacturer will need todetermine with an ESD simulator what levels of staticcharge cause equipment damage.6.2.6 It will be the responsibility of the equipmentmanufacturer to demonstrate that equipment operationdoes not generate more than the allowable amount ofcharge on product, carriers or equipment parts. This isshown in Section 7, Figure 2.6.3 Particle Attraction6.3.1 Electrostatic attraction (ESA) of particles canoccur due to the electrostatic field created by the chargeon the surface of an object. Both the field strength and,usually to a lesser degree, the divergence of the fieldinfluence the electrostatic contribution to particledeposition velocity. Electrostatic particle depositionvelocity also depends on particle size and particleelectrical charge. Unfortunately, even under controlledlaboratory conditions, accurate measurements ofelectric field strength, particle size distribution, and,especially, particle charge, are difficult. Of these threeparameters, electric field measurements are the mostlikely to be available.6.3.2 Measurements of electrostatic field can be madewith a commonly available electrostatic fieldmeter. Theunits of electrostatic field are volts/cm (volts/inch)."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 46 --",">"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E78-1102 \xa9 SEMI 1998, 2002 4 Precise measurements will be difficult as the presenceof the measuring instrument changes the fieldcharacteristics and may overstate the actual level ofelectrostatic field. This is shown in Section 7, Figure 3.SEMI E43 describes measurement techniques using anelectrostatic fieldmeter.6.3.3 Electrostatic deposition velocity depends only onelectric field, particle size and particle charge.However, the concentration of particles deposited on asurface also depends on the particle concentration in theequipment area and the length of the exposure timeduring which particle deposition occurs. Mechanismsother than electrostatic deposition, such as gravitationalsettling and diffusion, can also contribute to particledeposition. The concentration of particles deposited bythese non-electrostatic mechanisms will also vary withparticle concentration in the equipment ambient andexposure time.6.3.4 Comparisons of the electrostatic depositionvelocity with the deposition velocities associated withthese other deposition mechanisms is the key fordetermining threshold values of allowed electrostaticfield from the viewpoint of particle deposition. Suchcomparisons are the basis for estimating the allowedvalues of electrostatic field presented in Appendix A1-2.2 and Related Information R1-2. Users and equipmentmanufacturers should determine and agree on ambientparticle sizes and concentrations, and product exposuretimes.6.4 Equipment ESD6.4.1 Equipment ESD immunity is being addressed ingeneral through a number of international standardsincluding IEC 61000-4-2 and BS EN 61000-6-2 forEuropean CE compliance. Measurements are madeusing an ESD simulator which is described in thesestandards.6.4.2 The ESD simulator is used to create both a directdischarge to the surface of the equipment and an airdischarge to a surface 10 cm (4 inches) away from theequipment. The ESD simulator charges a 150 picofaradcapacitor (C) to a known voltage (V) and thendischarges it to produce a standardized dischargewaveform. Knowing the voltage and capacitanceinvolved in this test means the total charge can becalculated by the equation q = CV. For example, a 4000volt discharge (IEC 61000-4-2 test level) transfers acharge, q = 600 nanocoulombs.6.4.3 The value of the capacitor (C) in the ESDsimulator is specified in the international standards. Itshould not be assumed that a different value ofcapacitance and voltage that produce the same chargetransfer of 600 nanocoulombs would have the sameaffect on a specific piece of equipment. Discharge currents will vary with the impedance of the dischargepath and with the voltage. It is, however, impractical totest all possible combinations. For the purposes of thisguide, the parameters of the ESD simulator specified inthe standards for equipment ESD immunity will beused.6.4.4 For true ESD immunity, an ESD event inequipment must not disturb either the equipment itoccurs in, or another nearby piece of equipment. Chargeon product or carriers transferred from one piece ofequipment must not disturb the operation of subsequentequipment. It will be a systems issue to make sure thatall equipment in a facility meets the required ESDimmunity standards.6.4.5 The range of reactions in equipment to an ESDevent runs from transient errors that are automaticallycorrected, to hard errors that cannot be correctedwithout manual intervention or damage the equipment.While small numbers of transient errors may beacceptable from the point of view of equipmentoperation, they may still cause unacceptable productlosses.6.4.6 The user and manufacturer must determine withan ESD simulator what levels of ESD cause equipmentinterruptions. The user must determine if any of theseequipment interruptions caused by ESD are acceptable.6.4.7 In setting a level to provide ESD immunity foran individual piece of equipment from static charge onproducts and carriers, the charge on these items shouldbe kept below the levels determined by ESD simulatortesting.6.4.8 The Faraday Cup measurement can be used forthis purpose. If equipment has been tested for ESDimmunity and passes a 4000 volt test, then total chargeon product and carriers leaving this equipment shouldbe kept below 600 nanocoulombs. Any producttransferred at this level should not be handled by otherequipment with a lower ESD immunity. A possibleimplementation of this test method is shown in Section7, Figure 4. 7 Apparatus7.1 ESD Damage  The apparatus for determining theESD damage thresholds for products will depend on thetest methods used. See Section 4 for additionalinformation.

ESA or ESD events that result in thejamming or breakage of product in high speedequipment may create a personnel hazard. ESD eventsthat produce sparks must be prevented in areas that useflammable or explosive chemicals or gases. ESD eventsto personnel are usually not harmful, but they mayresult in an unwanted reflex, or startle reaction. Thisreflex may create a personnel hazard, particularly in thevicinity of moving equipment or where causticchemicals are in use. It may be necessary to useadditional static charge control methods, beyond thoseused inside the equipment, to minimize these personnelhazards.8.2 Measurement Safety  Users should exercisecaution while making static charge measurements in thevicinity of moving parts of production equipment, or inareas where static potentials on ungrounded conductorsmay exceed 30,000 volts.

Table 1 Recommended Sensitivity Levels ElectrostaticDischarge(Nanocoulombs) ParticleAttraction(Volts/cm) EquipmentMalfunction(Nanocoulombs)Level 4 100 4000 1200Level 3 50 400 600Level 2 10 200 300Level 1 1 100 150 12.5.1 Sensitivity Level 4 compliance means thatproducts, reticles, and carriers can leave the equipmentwith up to the recommended amounts of static chargeor electrostatic field measured on them according to thetest method used. This level essentially states that theequipment is used in a process that has no significantproblems handling charged product, nor are there issuesassociated with contamination or ESD damage.12.5.2 At levels 1, 2, or 3 a decision should be made asto what is the most serious static charge problem. TheSensitivity Level and test methods are chosenaccordingly. The lower the level of static chargeallowed, the more static control measures theequipment manufacturer may need to install.12.5.3 Level 1 may be used primarily by manufacturersof specialized components such as: gallium arsenidesemiconductors or magneto-resistive (MR) disk driveread heads; those experiencing significant losses due tocontamination; or those using specialized equipmentwith low immunity to ESD or EMI.12.6 The levels listed in Table 1 have been determinedas the result of analysis of working conditions, orexperiments done in operating semiconductor facilities. Justifications for these levels are found in Appendix 1.The actual levels to be used for any piece of productionequipment may be decided by agreement between theuser and manufacturer of the equipment.12.7 Other levels may be appropriate under specificequipment conditions and for specific devices. 13 Calculations13.1 A series of five measurements should be made.The average of the five measurements should notexceed the recommended level. 14 Reporting Results14.1 Data records should contain the followinginformation: Description of equipment under test includingmodel and serial numbers. Description of the equipment operating conditionsand environment. Measurement equipment and last calibration date. Description of objects measured and measurementlocations. Humidity and temperature at measurement locationwhen measurements were made. Results of measurements. Personnel making the measurements. Any other relevant comments. 15 Precision and Accuracy15.1 Accuracy of Test Methods  The test methodsreferenced in this document do not guarantee precisemeasurements of static charge levels. Similarly,maximum static charge levels recommended in thisdocument are not stated as precise requirements.Accuracy of approximately \xb1 20% is acceptable in allmeasuring instrumentation. At low static charge levelsor for more accurate measurements, alternativeinstrumentation and test methods may need to be used. 16 Related Documents16.1 EIA/JEDEC StandardsEIA/JESD22-A114  Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)Sensitivity Testing Human Body Model (HBM)EIA/JESD22-A115  Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)Sensitivity Testing Machine Model (MM)"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 50 --",">"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E78-1102 \xa9 SEMI 1998, 2002 8 JESD22-C101A  Field-Induced Charged-DeviceModel Test Method for Electrostatic DischargeWithstand Thresholds of Microelectronic Components16.2 Other DocumentsEN 50082  Generic Immunity Standard for CECompliance, CENELEC European UnionBS EN 61000-6-2  Electromagnetic compatibility(EMC) - Generic standards - Immunity for industrialenvironments - British Standards Institution (BSI).3 MIL-STD 883C  Notice 8  Method 3015.7 Electrostatic Discharge Sensitivity Classification 3 BSI, 389 Chiswick High Road, GB - LONDON W4 4AL")))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
