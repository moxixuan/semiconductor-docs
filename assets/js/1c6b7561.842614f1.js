Where   the\nvariation   exceeds   10%,   a   third   location   should   be\nselected  and  the  two  air  flows  in  the  best  agreement\naveraged  and  used.  The  use  of  a  single  centerline\nreading  for  obtaining  average  velocity  is  a  very  coarse\napproximation  and  is  not recommended.  If  a  traverse\ncannot be done, then the centerline duct velocity should\nbe  multiplied  by  0.9  for  a  coarse  estimate  of  actual\naverage  duct  velocity.  Center  line  duct  velocity  should\nnot  be  used  less  than  5  duct  diameters  from  an  elbow,\njunction, hood opening, or other source of turbulence.\nA2-8.2  For ducts 150 mm (6 in.) and smaller, at least 6\ntraverse  points  should  be  used.  For  round  ducts  larger\nthan 150 mm (6 in.) diameter, at least 10 traverse points\nshould  be  employed.  For  very  large  ducts  with  wide\nvariation in velocity, 20 traverse points will increase the\nprecision of the air flow measurement.\nA2-8.3    For  square  or  rectangular  ducts,  the  procedure\nis  to  divide  the  cross-section  into  a  number  of  equal\nrectangular  areas  and  measure  the  velocity  pressure  at\nthe  center  of  each.  The  number  of  readings  should  not\nbe less than 16. Enough readings should be made so the\ngreatest  distance  between  centers  is  less  than  150  mm\n(6 in.).\nA2-8.4  The following data are required:\nA2-8.4.1  The area of the duct at the traverse location.\nA2-8.4.2  Velocity pressure at each point in the traverse\nand/or average velocity and number of points measured.\nA2-8.4.3  Temperature of the air stream at the time and\nlocation of the traverse.\nA2-8.4.4    The  velocity  pressure  readings  obtained  are\nconverted  to  velocities,  and  the  velocities  (not  the\nvelocity  pressures)  are  averaged.  Useful  equation:  V  =\n4. 043  (VP/d)\n0. 5\n,  where  V  =  velocity  in  m/s,  VP  =\nvelocity   pressure   in   mm   H\n2\nO,   and   d   =   density\ncorrection     factor     (unitless).     Some     monitoring\ninstruments   conduct   this   averaging   internal   to   the\ninstrument.\nA2-8.5  Flow measurement taken at other than standard\nair   temperatures   should   be   corrected   to   standard\nconditions (i.e., 21\xb0C ","[70\xb0F]",", 760 mm ","[29.92 in.]"," Hg)."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S2-0703a\nE\n\xa9 SEMI 1991, 2004 40\nAPPENDIX 3\nDESIGN GUIDELINES FOR EQUIPMENT USING LIQUID CHEMICALS\n\u2014 Design and Test Method Supplement Intended for Internal and\nThird Party Evaluation Use\nNOTICE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  S2  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot\nprocedures on December 15, 1999  by the North American Regional Standards Committee.\nA3-1  Introduction\nA3-1.1      This   appendix provides   specific   technical\ninformation   relating   to   Section   23.

It  is  often  necessary  to\nperform  hazard  analyses  to  identify  hazards  that  are\nspecific  to  the  system,  and  develop  hazard  control\nmeasures  that  adequately  control  the  associated  risk\nbeyond  those  that  are  covered  in  existing  design-based\nstandards.   This   document   provides   guidelines   for\ndeveloping   a   deliberate,   planned   equipment/product\nsafety   (EPS)   program   integrating   the   compliance\nassessment  activities  with  hazard  analyses  and  other\nactivities  needed  to  provide  a  safe  system  throughout\nthe life of equipment or products.\nR1-1.2  An  effective  EPS  program  reduces  the  cost,\nschedule  slips,  and  liability  associated  with  the  late\nidentification  and  correction  of  hazards.  To  be  most\neffective,  an  EPS  program  should  be  begun  by  the\nmanufacturer  early  during  the  design  phase.  Starting\nearly  allows  safety  to  be  designed  into  the  system  and\nits     subsystems,     equipment,     facilities,     processes,\nprocedures,  and  their  interfaces  and  operations.  These\nguidelines  are  designed  to  assist  the  manufacturer  in\nplanning   and   implementation   of   an   effective   EPS\nprogram.\nR1-1.3  The  lowest  costs  for  implementing  safety  can\nbe  achieved  when  hazards  are  identified  and  resolved\nbefore  hardware  is  built  and  firmware  or  software  is\ncoded. This guide is intended to provide the basis for a\nmethodology  for  implementing  a  safety  program  for\nearly   and   continued   hazard   identification   and   the\nelimination or reduction of associated risks.\nR1-1.4  EPS  program  success  depends  directly  upon\nmanagement  emphasis  and  support  applied  during  the\nsystem design and development process and throughout\nthe  life  cycle  of  the  product.  This  emphasis  should\ninclude the following management controls:\nR1-1.4.1  Agreement  from  management  that  the  EPS\nprogram  will  be  maintained  and  supported  throughout\nthe product or facility life cycle;\nR1-1.4.2  Clear and early statements of agreement with\nEPS objectives and requirements;\nR1-1.4.3  Understanding  of,  and  participation  in,  the\nrisk acceptance process; and\nR1-1.4.4  Continuing  consideration  of  risk  reduction\nduring the management review process.\nR1-2  Purpose\nR1-2.1  This     guide     describes     an     approach     for\ndeveloping   and   implementing   an   EPS   program   of\nsufficient comprehensiveness to identify the hazards of\na  product  and  to  develop  design  and  administrative\ncontrols   to   prevent   incidents.   The   EPS   program\naddresses hazards from many sources to include system\ndesign,  hazardous  materials,  advancing  technologies,\nand new techniques. The goal is to eliminate hazards or\nreduce the associated risk to an acceptable level.\nR1-3  Scope\nR1-3.1  This  guide  applies  to  every  activity  of  the\nproduct     life     cycle     (e.g.,     research,     technology\ndevelopment,  design,  test  and  evaluation,  production,\nconstruction,          checkout/calibration,          operation,\nmaintenance and support, modification and disposal).\nR1-4  General Guidelines\nR1-4.1\nEPS  Program  \u2014  The  supplier  should  establish\nand  maintain  an  EPS  program  to  support  efficient  and\neffective   achievement   of   overall   EPS   objectives.\nDepending  upon  the  needs  of  the  company,  the  EPS\nProgram may be a company wide program covering all\nprojects,  separate  programs  for  each  project,  or  some\ncombination of the two.\nR1-4.1.1  Management  System  \u2014  The  supplier  should\nestablish  an  EPS  management  system  to  implement\nprovisions  of  this  guide  commensurate  with  the  needs\nof   the   program.   The   program   manager   should   be\nresponsible  for  the  establishment,  control,  incorpor-\nation, direction and implementation of the EPS program\npolicies  and  should  assure  that  risk  is  identified  and\neliminated  or  controlled.  The  supplier  should  establish\ninternal    reporting    systems    and    procedures    for\ninvestigation    and    disposition    of    product    related\nincidents   and   safety   incidents,   including   potentially\nhazardous conditions not yet involved in an incident.\nR1-4.2  EPS Design Guidelines\nR1-4.2.1  EPS design requirements should  be specified\nafter   review   of   pertinent   standards,   specifications,\nregulations, design handbooks, safety design checklists,"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S2-0703a\nE\n\xa9 SEMI 1991, 2004 51\nand other sources of design guidance for applicability to\nthe  design  of  the  system.  The  supplier  should  establish\nEPS   design   criteria   derived   from   applicable   data\nincluding   the   preliminary   hazard   analyses.   These\ncriteria   should   be   the   basis   for   developing   system\nspecification  EPS  requirements.  The  supplier  should\ncontinue  to  expand  the  criteria  and  requirements  for\ninclusion   in   development   specification   during   the\nsubsequent program phases.\nR1-5  Detailed Guidelines\nR1-5.1  The  purpose  of  the  EPS  program  is  to    ensure\nthat   the   equipment   or   product   is   designed   and\ndocumented  in  a  manner  that  reduces  the  safety  risk\nassociated with that equipment or product to a level that\nis   acceptable   to   the   customer.   This   consideration\napplies  to  all  life  cycle  phases  of  the  equipment  or\nproduct.    The    following    sections    include    detailed\nelements of a formal EPS program. Management should\nselect or tailor the elements appropriate to their needs.\nR1-5.2  EPS Program Plan (EPSPP) \u2014 The purpose of\na  EPS  Program  Plan  (EPSPP)  is  to  describe  the  tasks\nand  activities  of  EPS  management  and  engineering\nrequired   to   identify,   evaluate,   and   eliminate/control\nhazards,  or  reduce  the  associated  risk  to  an  acceptable\nlevel   throughout   the   system   life   cycle.   The   plan\nprovides  a  basis  of  understanding  of  how  to  organize\nand execute an effective EPS program.\nR1-5.2.1  EPS  Program  Scope  and  Objectives  \u2014  Each\nEPSPP  should  describe,  as  a  minimum,  the  following\nfour elements of an effective EPS program:\n\u2022 a planned approach for task accomplishment,\n\u2022 qualified people to accomplish tasks,\n\u2022 authority  to  implement  tasks  through  all  levels  of\nmanagement, and\n\u2022 appropriate commitment of resources (both staffing\nand funding) to assure tasks are completed.\n\u2022 The scope and objectives should:\n\u2022 Describe  the  scope  of  the  overall  program  and  the\nrelated EPS program.\n\u2022 Identify    the    tasks    and    activities    of    EPS\nmanagement  and  engineering  functions.

The    International\nCommission      on      Radiation      Protection      (ICRP)\nrecommends   that   any   exposure   above   the   natural\nbackground   radiation   should   be   kept   as   low   as\nreasonably  achievable,  but  below  the  individual  dose\nlimits.  The  total  individual  dose  limit  for  radiation\nworkers  over  5  years  is  100  mSv,  and  for  members  of\nthe general public, is 1 mSv per year. These dose limits\nhave  been  established  based  on  a  prudent  approach  by\nassuming  that  there  is  no  threshold  dose  below  which\nthere would be no effect. This hypothesis proposes that\nany additional dose will cause a proportional increase in\nthe  chance  of  a  health  effect.  This  relationship  has  not\nyet  been  established  in  the  low  dose  range  where  the\ndose limits have been set.\nR7-1.3  The   ICRP   and   the   IAEA   recommend   the\nindividual  dose  must  be  kept  as  low  as  reasonably\nachievable  and  consideration  must  be  given  to  the\npresence  of  other  sources  that  may  cause  simultaneous\nradiation  exposure  to  the  same  group  of  the  public.\nAlso, allowance for future sources or practices must be\nkept  in  mind  so  that  the  total  dose  received  by  an\nindividual  member  of  the  public  does  not  exceed  the\ndose limit.\nR7-2  How Does This Apply to the\nSemiconductor Industry?\nR7-2.1  A  person  who  can  potentially  be  exposed  to\nionizing radiation during the normal course of business\nin  excess  of  the  annual  limit  for  the  general  public\nshould  be  considered  a  radiation  worker.  A  radiation\nworker  is  trained  to  recognize  and  protect  him  or\nherself  from  the  hazards  of  ionizing  radiation.  They\nmay    require    exposure    monitoring    to    determine\ncompliance  with  local  radiation  regulations.  Radiation\nworkers  are  covered  by  a  radiation  safety  program.  A\nradiation  safety  program  is  an  administrative  control.\nEngineering  controls  minimize  the  need  for  spending\nresources in a large scale radiation program.\nR7-2.2  The  exposure  limit  for  the  radiation  worker  is\n20 millisievert (2000 millirem) per year. Based on a 40\nhour/week,  50  week/working  year  basis,  the  allowable\nionizing  radiation  emissions  are  10  microsieverts/hr\n(1.0    millirem/hr).    This    exposure    rate    should    be\nevaluated   as   an   emission   rate   from   any   accessible\nsurface  of  the  equipment  (the  closest  approach  to  the\nsurface that the radiation is penetrating).\nR7-2.3  Maintenance technicians for radiation machines\nshould be participants in the radiation safety program as\nradiation workers. The equipment should be designed to\nallow  maintenance  technicians  access  to  areas  that  do\nnot exceed 10 microsieverts/hr.\nR7-2.4  Service   technicians   for   radiation   machines\nshould  be  participants  in  their  employer\u2019s  radiation\nsafety  program  as  radiation  workers.  The  equipment\nshould  be  designed  to  allow  service  technicians  access\nto  areas  that  exceed  the  10  microsievert  per  hour  level\nwhen operating, but not while the radiation is present.\nR7-2.5  The    person    operating    radiation    producing\nequipment   (Operator)   should   not   be   considered   a\nradiation  worker.  The  emission  limit  for  the  operator\naccessible  areas  is  recommended  to  be  20%  of  the\noccupational  limit.  The  maximum  allowable  ionizing\nradiation  emissions  for  operator  accessible  areas  is\nrecommended     to     be     2     microsieverts/hr     (0.2\nmillirem/hr). This exposure rate should be evaluated as\nan    emission    rate    from    any    surface    foreseeably\naccessible by an operator of the equipment, and should\nbe measured as an instantaneous rate.\nR7-3  Definitions\nR7-3.1  accessible  \u2014  a  significant  part  of  the  whole\nbody, head, or eyes.\nR7-3.2  bremsstrahlung  \u2014  is  radiation  produced  by\nslowing of charged particles.

This related information was approved for publication by vote of the responsible committee on\nOctober 21, 1999.\nThe  following  is  some  of  the  research  leading  to  the\nvalues in Table 1 in Section 18 of this guideline.\nR13-1      The  proposed  Hazardous  Temperature  Limits\nwere  derived  from  UL1950\n12\nand  IEC950\n13\nby  adding\nambient     temperature     (25\xb0C)     to     the     maximum\ntemperature    rise    allowed    for    external    parts    of\ninformation   technology   equipment.   Because   several\nSEMI  members  have  questioned  whether  these  limits\nmight  subject  operators  and  maintenance  personnel  to\ncontact   with   potentially   hazardous   temperatures,   a\nreview   has   been   done   of   several   other   sources   of\nsuggested temperature limits.\nR13-2    The  proposed  hazardous  surface  temperatures\nfor handling and touching of metal handles, knobs, etc.,\nfor  brief  periods  in  normal  use  is  60\xb0C.  Assuming  a\nbrief handling time to be 5 seconds or less, this limit is\nsupported   in   MIL-STD-1472\n14\n,   MIL-HDBK-759A\n15"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"and EN563\n16\n(which are the same or more conservative\nby  2\xb0C),  and  is  equal  to  the  pain  and  tissue  damage\nthreshold    listed    in    the    Human    Factors    Design\nHandbook\n17\n.    Thus,    this    temperature    limit    seems\nappropriate   for   momentary   (five   seconds   or   less)\ncontact  with  uncoated  metal  handles,  knobs,  etc.,  and\nother material with high thermal conductivity.\nR13-3      The  proposed  hazardous  surface  temperatures\nfor  handling  and  touching  of  glass/porcelain  handles,\nknobs,  etc.,  for  brief  periods  in  normal  use  is  70\xb0C.\nThis  temperature  limit  is  supported  by  MIL-STD-1472\nand EN563.

MIL-HDBK-759 is not applicable.\nR13-5    The  proposed  hazardous  surface  temperatures\nfor continuous handling and touching of metal handles,\nknobs,   etc.,   during   normal   usage   is   55\xb0C.   It   is\nsuggested,   based   on   observations   of   semiconductor\nequipment  in  use,  that  a  continuous  handling  time  of\none minute be used. With this duration, the limit of the\nMIL-STD and the MIL-HDBK ranges from 49 to 52\xb0C.\nThe EN563 burn threshold limit for contact with metal\nfor  one  minute  is  51\xb0C.  The  burning  heat  pain  level\nlisted  in  the  Human  Factors  Design  Handbook  is  49\xb0C\n(no time frame given; assume high thermal conductivity\nmaterial). Thus, the proposed temperature limit appears\nto   be   somewhat   high   for   reasonably   foreseeable\nextended handling contact with uncoated metal handles,\nknobs,   etc.,   and   other   material   with   high   thermal\nconductivity.

The  limit  of  MIL-STD-\n1472D is 59\xb0C for \u201cprolonged contact\u201d with glass. The\nEN563  burn  threshold  limit  at  1  minute  is  56\xb0C.  Thus,\nthe  proposed  temperature  limit  appears  to  be  slightly\nhigh   for   reasonably   foreseeable   extended   handling\ncontact   with   glass/porcelain   surfaces   of   moderate\nthermal  conductivity.  The  Section  18  Table  1  limit  is\n56\xb0C,    which    is    the    more    conservative    of    the\nrecommendations.  This  limit  could  be  raised  based\nupon  the  results  of  the  risk  assessment  for  actual  and\nforeseeable normal usage.\nR13-7   Similarly,   the   proposed   hazardous   surface\ntemperatures  for  extended  handling  and  touching  of\nplastic/rubber handles, knobs, etc., during normal usage\n(again  assuming  1  minute)  is  75\xb0C.  The  limit  of  MIL-\nSTD-1472D   is   69\xb0C   for   \u201cprolonged   contact\u201d   with\nplastic.  The  EN563  burn  threshold  limit  at  1  minute  is\n60\xb0C.   Thus,   the   proposed   temperature   limit   again\nappears  to  be  slightly  high  for  reasonably  foreseeable\nextended  handling  contact  with  plastic/rubber  surfaces\nof  low  thermal  conductivity.

It is assumed that this limit\napplies       to       inadvertent       touching       by       the\noperator/maintenance  person,  resulting  in  the  person\ninstantly  breaking  contact  with  the  hot  surface.

The  EN563  burn\nthreshold  range  for  one-second  contact  with  uncoated\nmetal  is  65  to  70\xb0C,  while  the  range  for  one-second\ncontact   with   glass   is   80   to   86\xb0C.
