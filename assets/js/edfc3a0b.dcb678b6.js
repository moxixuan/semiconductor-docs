This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures. R2-1 Association of IMMC State Changes with EPT Module State ChangesR2-1.1 The IMMC defines the IMM as an EPT Module, and the tool connected to the IMM is required to includethe IMM among its EPT Modules.R2-1.2 The EPT state of the IMM as a whole is based on three components: the state of the STPO, the state of theportion of the IMM that is independent of the STPO (representing loading and unloading of substrates) and thecombined state of any IMM Data Table Object (representing either current measurement (raw data) or calibration)or data conversion activities. The IMMC does not require the IMM-only (exclusive of STPO and IMM Data TableObject states) to have a state model representing any other activities that it may be performing, but to correctlycalculate the EPT state as a whole, its own EPT states must be done.R2-1.2.1 IMM-Only State  Excluding activities performed by, and subsystems used only by, an STPO orrepresented by an IMM Data Table Object state, the IMM-only may contain various subsystems, such as an aligner,the various sensors used for measuring, and mechanisms for moving a substrate from one Substrate Location toanother, but excludes those mechanisms used solely by an STPO. The IMM-only, then, will be either: actively performing some task, with or without material, with no faults (EPT-BUSY), inactive, without material, and with no reason that would prevent it from performing any of its normal tasks(EPT-IDLE), or inactive, either with material present or because of a fault in one of its subsystems (EPT-BLOCKED).R2-1.2.2 The IMM Service state is not related to the IMM EPT State. Whether IN SERVICE or OUT OFSERVICE, the IMM-Only can be in any of the three EPT states.R2-1.3 STPO StateR2-1.3.1 The STPO is IDLE only in the READY TO LOAD state. Here it has no material, is performing noactivity, and has nothing to prevent it from performing a load activity.R2-1.3.2 The STPO is BUSY only in the ASSIGNED state.R2-1.3.3 The STPO is BLOCKED in the BLOCKED state.R2-1.3.4 The STPO is BLOCKED in the READY TO UNLOAD state, because, although it is not performing anactivity, it has material.R2-1.4 IMM Data Table Object StateR2-1.4.1 The combined IMM Data Table Object state, for EPT purposes, is determined by the combination of allIMM Data Table Objects stored within the IMM.R2-1.4.2 The combined state is BUSY if at least one IMM Data Table Object is IN PROCESS.R2-1.4.3 If no IMM Data Table Object is IN PROCESS, then the combined state is IDLE.R2-1.4.4 There is no state for an IMM Data Table Object that corresponds to BLOCKED.R2-1.5 The rules for determining the IMM EPT State are as follows: If any of the above components is BLOCKED, then the IMM EPT State is BLOCKED. If no component is BLOCKED and at least one is BUSY, then the IMM EPT State is BUSY. If all three components are IDLE, then the IMM EPT State is IDLE."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 5 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E127-0705 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2005 56 R2-1.6 The statements in the above sections are summarized in tabular format by Table R2-1.

Current editionapproved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on October 16, 2003 and December 4, 2003.Initially available at ",(0,i.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.semi.org"},"www.semi.org")," February 2004; to be published March 2004. Originally published July2003. 1 Purpose1.1 This standard specifies XML structures required toencode message header or envelope information forasynchronous messages. It applies to applicationsconforming to other SEMI standards only if they useasynchronous XML messaging for communication.XML is used in software applications to encodeinformation with tags that provide structure and datatype information specified in XML Schemas. XML isalso used to structure information needed to route anddeliver messages between applications. A standard formessage headers is required to avoid development anduse of multiple incompatible protocols based on XML.This specification will be referred to as The XMLMessaging Specification.1.2 The XML Messaging Specification providesdefinitions of message headers needed for messagesexchanged in an asynchronous fashion. Asynchronousmessages are delivered independently withoutdependence on transport technology to correlate relatedmessages. The rationale for choosing an asynchronousmessage delivery mechanism is based on thecharacteristics of the interaction between two softwaresystems. Some of these reasons are that: Support for long-running Request/Replyinteractions may not be practical in a synchronoussession-oriented communication. Some messaging interactions require additionalcallback messages reporting on server activitywhich supplement the reply message. Clients may wish to interleave requests and repliesto manage parallel or overlapping activities inmultiple concurrent messaging conversations.1.3 The base technology supporting asynchronousmessaging may also support synchronous interactionsthat rely on transport sessions for identification andcorrelation of related messages. The XML MessagingSpecification does not prevent these synchronousmessaging dialogs since the specified header elementsare not required in these cases. However, there may bebenefits of using the message header elements specifiedhere even in synchronous interactions. The messageheader elements provide self describing information about messages that may be useful for debugging ortracking message traffic. Their use may also enablefuture migration to different message transports.1.4 The XML Messaging Specification usesestablished, openly referenceable industry standards forXML messaging where possible. It only specifiesextensions to existing industry standards when neededto meet the immediate requirements for messaging in aSEMI Standard application context. The intent of thisstandard is not to replicate existing standards or offercompeting specifications, but to align with and cite theusage of existing standards. 2 Scope2.1 In Scope  The XML Messaging Specificationwill include within its scope the following:2.1.1 Use of the W3C Simple Object Access Protocol(SOAP)  SOAP is used as a basic message foundationfor SEMI messaging applications.2.1.2 Definition of SOAP Extensions  Thisspecification defines SOAP extensions for header andbody elements needed to support asynchronousmessaging interactions.2.1.3 Structures for Request/Reply Point-to-PointMessage Dialogs  This specification will address themessage header data needed to support request/replyinteractions with a request message and correspondingreply message using asynchronous, one-way messages.2.1.4 Structures for Asynchronous Point-to-PointCallback Messages  This specification will addressthe message header data needed to enable atomic,asynchronous callback messages that complement arequest/reply dialog between two endpoints.2.1.5 Structures for Asynchronous Multicast EventMessages  This specification will address themessage header data needed to enable atomic,asynchronous event messages distributed via apublication multicast to multiple subscribers.2.1.6 Use of W3C Web Services Definition Language(WSDL)  WSDL is a message metadata specificationlanguage for describing signatures of web serviceinterfaces. This specification will define how WSDL"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 18 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E128-0304 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2004 2 will be used to represent the interfaces intended forasynchronous message exchange patterns.2.2 Out of Scope  The following topics are beyondthe scope of this specification. These topics may beaddressed in separate specifications, but are notintended as future additions to this standard.2.2.1 Message Security  The specification does notprovide mechanisms for authentication of the messagesender or receiver or for securing the content ofmessages from unauthorized access.2.2.2 Quality of Performance  The XML MessagingSpecification does not provide performancerequirements or conformance testing for theperformance characteristics of message transports.There may be environments in which XML messagingstructures are not appropriate or effective for highperformance communications. The definition of theenvironments where XML Messaging may or may notbe appropriate is beyond the scope of this document.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Provisional Standard Deficiencies  Thisdocument is Provisional due to areas where thespecification needs additions. When these missingtopics are addressed with subsequent revisions, thisstandard will be upgraded to remove Provisional status.The following items are cited as deficiencies in thisdocument:3.1.1 SOAP 1.2  This specification depends on theW3C SOAP standard. The release of the full SOAP 1.2W3C Recommendation is anticipated in early 2003.Once it is formally adopted, this specification will needto make adjustments for changes between SOAP 1.1and SOAP 1.2.3.1.2 Namespace for XML Messaging Schema  Thisprovisional specification will need to be aligned with afuture guideline for the specification of namespacesbelonging to SEMI Standards.3.1.3 Structure for Publish/Subscribe Event Messages This provisional specification does not yet providemechanisms for defining messages for distribution via amulticast publish/subscribe mechanism.3.1.4 Structure for Attachments with Non-XML Data This provisional specification does not yet specifythe message structure for messages that have both a SOAP envelope and a message attachment containingnon-XML data.3.1.5 WSDL Requirements  The provisionalspecification does not yet specify the form of WSDLrequired for exposing services for access usingasynchronous messaging. Additional investigation intoWSDL and SOAP 1.2 Message Exchange Patterns isrequired before completing the WSDL section of thisspecification. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Standards1 Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (SecondEdition)  W3C Recommendation, 6 October 2000.(See ",(0,i.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006.)The"},"http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006.)The")," latest version of Extensible Markup Lanuage(XML) 1.0 is available at ",(0,i.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml.Namespaces"},"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml.Namespaces")," in XML  W3C Recommendation, 14January 1999.

The following XMLNamespace declaration shall be used to specify thenamespace. 6.3 Use of SOAP Messages for SynchronousRequest/Reply Interactions  The XML MessagingSpecification does not preclude the use of SOAP forsynchronous interactions. The SOAP HeaderExtensions specified in this document are not requiredfor a synchronous exchange, but may be useful even inthose cases. A standard adopting a synchronous use ofSOAP shall clearly indicate whether the headerextensions are required for conformantimplementations.6.4 SOAP Header Entry for Messaging  The SOAPmessage shall have an entry contained in theSOAP-ENV:Header element named MessageHeaderthat contains elements as defined in this section. TheMessageHeader element shall be defined with amustUnderstand = 1 attribute that requires allconformant implementations to process the headerelement or return a MustUnderstand fault to themessage sender.6.4.1 From  The From element shall identify theapplication that sent this message. The format of thevalue in the From element shall be a valid URI. Thedomain of the value in the From element may vary bytransport binding.6.4.2 To  The To element shall identify theapplication that is the intended recipient of thismessage. The format of the value in the To elementshall be a valid URI. The domain of the value in the Toelement may vary by transport binding.6.4.3 MessageType  The MessageType elementshall identify the role of the message in a conversation.A message shall be either a request, reply or callbackmessage.6.4.4 Request Message  A request message shalloriginate from an endpoint in the client role and shallestablish a new RequestId. The RequestId shall beunique within the domain of all such Ids generated bythe originating client. The request message bodycontains the information needed by the server to enableit to perform a requested action on behalf of the client.6.4.4.1 Reply Message  A reply message shalloriginate from an endpoint in the server role and shallecho the RequestId received from a client in a priorrequest message as a CorrelationId. The reply messagebody may contain information that conveys thecompletion of an action initiated by a related requestmessage. It may instead include a body entry for aFault that communicates the reason for a failure.

A callback message body containsunspecified information that relates to the requestedaction initiated by a related request message. Acallback message may precede the reply message (aleading callback message), or it may follow the replymessage (a trailing callback message). The callbackmessage shall also contain an element for theEventIndex if the server will send more than onecallback message. The body of a callback message mayalso contain SOAP Faults if there is a processing errorthat needs to be conveyed to the client.6.4.5 RequestId  The RequestId element shall beused in a request message to identify it as the first of aseries of messages that belong to a single interaction.The value of RequestId shall be generated by a clientwith the initial request message and then shall beechoed back as the CorrelationId in subsequentcallback messages or reply messages from theresponding server. The XML Schema shall specify achoice between RequestId and CorrelationId.RequestId shall be the choice when MessageType isRequest.6.4.6 CorrelationId  The CorrelationId elementshall be used in each reply or callback message toidentify it as part of an interaction that was initiated bya prior request message. The value of CorrelationIdshall be identical to the RequestId from the initialrequest message. The same CorrelationId value shallbe echoed back in all callback messages or replymessages sent from the server in response to the clientsinitial request message. The XML Schema shallspecify a choice between RequestId and CorrelationId.CorrelationId shall be chosen when MessageType isReply or Callback.6.4.7 Action  The Action element shall be a stringthat serves to identify the unit of functionality invokedby the request message. An Action value shall beunique to the recipient of the message.6.4.8 ReplyExpected  The ReplyExpected elementis optional. When present, the ReplyExpected elementshall indicate whether the client expects to receive areply message by a true value. When present with avalue of false, the ReplyExpected element shallindicate that the client does not expect to receive a replymessage. If not present, the server receiving the requestshall assume that a reply is expected (equivalent to a true value). A service shall be prepared to return areply for every request, and a client shall be prepared toreceive replies even if this element is set to false.ReplyExpected is intended only for optimizingconversations where the client intends to ignore replymessages.6.4.9 MessageId  The MessageId element shall beoptional in the MessageHeader to define a string valueto uniquely identify the message. MessageId need notbe included in the MessageHeader if there is no valueestablished for uniquely identifying each message bythe selected message transport. If present, MessageIdshall be globally unique.6.4.10 EventIndex  The EventIndex element shall beoptional in the MessageHeader of a callback message.EventIndex shall not be included in request or replymessages. Within the MessageHeader of a callbackmessage, EventIndex is optional only if there is just onecallback message in an interaction, but required if thereare a series of callbacks. EventIndex is used to identifythis messages position in relation to multiple callbackmessages resulting from the original request.6.4.10.1 EventIndex Sub-elements  EventIndex shallcontain sub-elements for Position, and either Total orFinished as specified in the following paragraphs.Either Total or Finished shall be present, but not both.6.4.10.2 Position  The Position element shallindicate this messages position in a stream of callbackmessages. Position shall be greater than or equal to 1.Position shall be less than or equal to Total, when Totalis present.6.4.10.3 Total  The Total element shall indicate thefinal count of callback messages to be delivered in thisinteraction (that is, all messages sharing a commonRequestId/CorrelationId). Total shall have the samevalue in each callback message in the sequence.6.4.10.4 Finished  The Finished element shallindicate whether this is the last in a sequence ofcallback messages. Finished shall be present in callbackmessages for interactions in which the total number ofcallback messages cannot be known in advance. Avalue of false shall indicate that additional callbackmessages will be sent. A value of true shall indicatethat no further callback messages will be sent.6.4.10.5 Default Interpretation if EventIndex is notPresent  If EventIndex is not present, the clientreceiving the callback message shall interpret it asequivalent to a EventIndex element with Position = 1and Total = 1, indicating a single callback messagefrom server to client."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 21 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E128-0304 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 20045 6.4.11 MessageHeader XML Schema  The XML schema in Figure 1 defines the MessageHeader element that isrequired by this specification.

The transport used in a synchronous interaction typically manages the correlation of the requestwith the reply by completing the interaction in a single step. Synchronous interactions have the advantage ofsimplicity.R1-1.2 Synchronous interactions often also come with limitations. The client may not perform other activitieswhile waiting for the reply.

This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures. R2-1 Transport IndependenceR2-1.1 The aim of these examples is to keep implementation and transport mechanism specifics separated from theuse of the XML Messaging Specification. The example interface consists of five operations: start(myName)  starts the messaging send/receive endpoint, send(destName, envelope)  sends a message to another endpoint, stop() terminates the messaging endpoint, onMessage(envelope)  callback provided by an application to process incoming messages, and receive()  waits for next message (needed when onMessage is not supported).R2-1.2 This kind of interface abstracts the minimum functionality needed to send and receive messages. Anypotential message transport (HTTP, JMS, HSMS, RMI, etc.) could be encapsulated into methods similar to these tokeep the messaging implementation independent of the transport. An application could then be written using HTTPtoday and then easily switched to JMS a year later. Also, new applications could be prototyped with lightweighttransports and deployed with robust MOM transports with no change to application code.R2-1.3 This Related Information is based on a simple example (illustrated in Figure R2-1) of a typical interactionbetween a client application sending requests to a server which provides the service and sends reply messages. Thepurpose of this example is to illustrate the way the message header elements proposed in this specification arerealized in an asynchronous messaging implementation over HTTP."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 33 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,'SEMI E128-0304 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 200417 Client Server getCounter" Request , cId = 1 getCounter" Reply , cId = 1 setCounter" Request, cId = 2 setCounter" Reply, cId = 2 counter = 0 counter = 123 counter = 123 getCounter" Request , cId = 3 getCounter" Reply , cId = 3 counter = 123 bogusAction" Request , cId = 4 bogusAction" Reply , cId = 4Fault Value = badrequest Figure R2-1Sample Interaction for Messaging Examples R2-1.4 In order to show this example in an application context, it was implemented in Java for both HTTP and JMStransports. The examples that follow were extracted from this sample application and the debug output of therunning example. R2-2 SOAP/HTTPR2-2.1 Since HTTP is inherently synchronous, a common implementation would support only synchronousrequest/reply and would not use any of the MessageHeader elements that support asynchronous messaging. In thesynchronous case, only the To and Action elements would be present in the MessageHeader. The To element wouldmap to the URL of the target service and Action could also be URL encoded.R2-2.2 To implement asynchronous messages over HTTP, both client and server endpoints must listen for messagescoming through the selected transport. Each message is interpreted based on both the transport properties and theXML MessageHeader included in the SOAP header. Unlike more typical HTTP usage, the request and reply are not'),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 34 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,'SEMI E128-0304 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2004 18 constrained to a single session context, and can be separated in time. There is no blocking on pending replies.This model lends itself better to clients or servers that deal with many messaging partners at a time, while stillneeding to act on common data.R2-2.3 In the HTTP/SOAP transport example, each of the messages in the sample scenario will be sent with anHTTP Post operation. Every message will include an XML document containing a SOAP envelope and theMessageHeader specified in this standard. The message body will contain the application specific elements thatcommunicate the content of each message.R2-2.4 The elements of the MessageHeader contain data that is used to construct the appropriate HTTP messageand to populate the properties of the SOAP message. Specifically, the destination URL for each message appears inthe To attribute of the MessageHeader. The From attribute contains the URL of the sender of each message. TheSOAPAction HTTP header replicates the Action element in the transport specific header attribute.R2-2.5 This example (and the ones that follow) include both the HTTP properties and the XML message from theclient perspective. The request message shown in Figure R2-2 illustrates the HTTP transport form of the message.

The PSEM300 consists ofequipment characteristics and behaviors that apply tothis class of equipment and are required to beimplemented. The intent of this document is tofacilitate the integration of prober equipment into anautomated semiconductor factory. This documentaccomplishes this by defining an operational model forprober equipment as viewed by a host. This definitionprovides a standard host interface and equipmentoperational behavior. 2 Scope2.1 The PSEM300 extends the generic Process StateModel of SEMI E30 (GEM) with a Specific ProcessState model for prober equipment. This standardattempts to be protocol independent. There is noattempt to replace the protocol dependent aspects ofSEMI E30 (GEM). Instead, this document assumes thatcertain equipment features not covered within theconcepts and behaviors of the related 300 mm standardswill be supported using the concepts and behaviorsdefined within SEMI E30. See Section 9 for adescription of the SEMI E30 provisions.2.2 This document does not attempt to define the fullset of equipment capabilities. It is understood thatadditional value-added features will be provided inaddition to the requirements set forth in this document.2.3 This document intends host-instructed indexing ofsites within a substrate and the loading/unloading of thesubstrates. Automated self-indexing with suchcommunications as GPIB or RS-232C between testerand prober equipment is outside the scope of thisspecification but is not precluded. See the RelatedInformation section for reference.2.4 This document does not describe much aboutrecovery of exception or manual operation to recoverfrom alarm / potential-alarm (warning) situations. Suchconditions are usually configuration specific. 2.5 This standard presents a solution from the conceptsand behavior down to the messaging services. It doesnot define the messaging protocol.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This document does not define the format of eachdata item specified in the equipment recipe.3.2 This document does not define a communicationsprotocol.

Process Job Managementstandard (SEMI E40) is part of the required behavior of this document as described in Section 9. For additionaldescription of this behavior see Section 10 or See the actual standard, SEMI E40.8.1.1 The Process State model tracks the state of the equipment with regard to its ability to perform processing on asubstrate. The Process State model is used to inform the host when a substrate is loaded on the main chuck and hasbeen properly setup for processing.8.1.2 It is expected that the prober will be preparing a substrate to be loaded on the main chuck while the host isprocessing an existing substrate on the main chuck. This concurrent activity does not impact the hosts ability toprocess the existing substrate and therefore does not cause a change in the Process State model. The standard forSubstrate Tracking (SEMI E90) is used for tracking substrates between individual substrate locations.8.1.3 The processing state model in this document is required for implementing a PSEM300-compliant prober, inaddition to the required state models in the related standards. A state model consists of a state model diagram, statedefinitions, and a state transition table.

In certain implementations, the prober may entera state and has already satisfied all of the conditions required by the PSEM300 state model for transition to anotherstate. In this situation, the prober makes the required transition without any additional actions.8.1.4 Some equipment may need to include additional states. However, any additional states must not change thePSEM300-defined state transitions. All expected transitions between PSEM300 states must occur.

Instead, this document takes anhierarchical approach to identifying the methods forachieving a given task as shown inRelated Standards Hierarchy.9.1.1 SEMI E30 Inclusions  All of the SEMI E30state models are required with exception of theprocessing state diagram. This diagram is replacedwith the one defined in this standard.9.1.2 SEMI E30 Exclusions  Data Type restrictionsmay conflict with the newer 300 mm standards andtherefore, the constraints found within the newerstandards shall take precedence over the restrictionsfound in SEMI E30 section 5 Data Types. 10 Process JobsNOTE 1: SEMI E40 is required for PSEM300 compliance.10.1 A PSEM300 prober is not able to operate as anindependent processing agent. It requires a host tocoordinate interaction with the tester. This documentdefines a suitable GEM interface consisting of theProcess State Model and associated remote commandsto allow the host to act as the processing agent onbehalf of the prober to complete the execution of theprocess job.10.2 This standard assumes that if the equipment has apipeline (e.g. pre-align stage and main chuck), theequipment will support concurrent process jobs suchthat when the last substrate of an active process jobleaves the first pipeline stage, the equipment willlaunch another process job thus maintaining continuousmaterial flow.10.3 Process Job Preconditioning  This standarddoes not attempt to define the set of recipe attributesthat, when different from the current equipmentconfiguration, will require a transition to the Process Job SETTING UP state (preconditioning required).The recipe attributes that do impact the Process Jobtransition to SETTING UP will be user defined anddocumented as such.10.4 A PM compliance checklist must be filled out toindicate the level of compliance to both theFundamental and Additional PM capabilities. 11 Control JobNOTE 2: SEMI E94 is required for PSEM300 compliance.11.1 See SEMI E94 for details of Control Jobmanagement.11.2 A substrates destination substrate location isspecified in the Control Jobs MtrlOutSpec attribute. Ifthe MtrlOutSpec attribute is not set, the destinationsubstrate location defaults to the source substratelocation.11.3 A CJM compliance checklist must be filled out toindicate the level of compliance to Fundamental CJMcapabilities (no Additional capabilities are defined atthis time). 12 Carrier ManagementNOTE 3: SEMI E87 is required for PSEM300 compliance.12.1 CarrierReCreate  After processing material fora given carrier, the host must be able to define a newCJ/PJ for the same carrier without having to remove thecarrier from the tool. For this, the equipment mustsupport the CarrierReCreate service.12.2 A CMS compliance checklist must be filled out toindicate the level of support for CMS for a givenequipment configuration. 13 Substrate TrackingNOTE 4: SEMI E90 is required for PSEM300 compliance."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 44 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E130-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2004 8 13.1 Substrate Tracking must be supported for allproduct substrates and substrate locations whereproduct substrates may reside. Some of the substratelocations that might exist include: handling robot, post-chuck substrate location.13.2 The supplier may choose not to support substratetracking for certain internal substrate locations. This isallowable if the substrate location will not be occupiedby product substrates (e.g. Cleaning Media tray, AUXTray). The supplier must document which substratelocations are available for substrate tracking.13.3 A CMS CarrierReCreate service will cause eachof the substrates contained within a recreated carrier tobe reset to the AT SOURCE and NEEDSPROCESSING state.NOTE 5: A STS compliance checklist must be filled out toindicate the level of compliance to STS Fundamental andAdditional capabilities. 14 Equipment Configuration14.1 This standard does not attempt to specify thephysical equipment configuration. The intent of thisstandard is to provide a generalized specification thatapplies to all configurations. The supplier isresponsible for assuring that additional featuresintegrate consistently with the relevant standardsimpacted by the feature. The purpose of this section isto add clarification to baseline assumptions that areimplied throughout this specification.14.2 Pipeline14.2.1 A typical pipeline configuration consists of apre-align stage used to pre-process a substrate beforeloading onto the chuck. The equipment can beginprocessing the substrate on the chuck while the nextsubstrate is being prepared on the pre-align stage. Forthis configuration, the material flow is assumed tofollow the path: source substrate location  pre-alignstage  chuck  destination substrate location. Theremay be additional substrate locations both before andafter the chuck. 15 Control Maps15.1 Control Maps provide a mechanism forcommunicating the selective sites for processing in apre-determined manner. Control Maps are not suitablefor adaptive test where dynamic site selection is used.15.2 Control Map Uses15.2.1 Inking  The host can download a control mapcontaining the sites to be inked. The host issues theINK DIE remote command specifying the control mapas the source for the die list. 15.2.2 Normal Processing  When using a ControlMap, the host issues the INDEX remote command tomove the prober coordinates to the next site listed in theControl Map. The host may issue a move relatedcommand other than INDEX to move the chuck to anylocation on the substrate. Move commands other thanINDEX, do not impact the state of the Control Map.The prober processes subsequent INDEX commands bygoing to the next site listed in the Control Map. If theControl Map does not contain additional sites theequipment sends an event to the host indicating that thecontrol map has been completed.15.2.3 Interrupted Processing  If the processing of asubstrate using a Control Map is interrupted (i.e.Correlation Test, Probe Cleaning with a cleaningsubstrate, Chuck Reset, etc...), the equipment shallresume processing with the Control Map from the pointwhere processing was suspended when the substrateprocessing resumes. The exceptions to this requirementare15.2.3.1 If the current Process Job is altered such thatthe suspended substrate is no longer in the INPROCESS state, the Control Map is no longer valid.15.2.3.2 If the host issues a RESET-CONTROL-MAPcommand, the Control Map will resume at the first site.If the host designates coordinates with the RESET-CONTROL-MAP command, the prober will resume theControl Map with the designated coordinates. It is theresponsibility of the host to assure that the coordinatesprovided with this command are contained in theControl Map.15.3 If the host issues a SET-CONTROL-MAPcommand, the prober will begin processing the ControlMap at the first site of the designated Control Map. Ifthe host designates coordinates with the SET-CONTROL-MAP command, the prober will processthe Control Map beginning with the designatedcoordinates. It is the responsibility of the host to assurethat the coordinates provided with this command arecontained in the Control Map.15.4 Control Map Transmission  The method fordownloading/uploading control maps is outside thescope of this document.15.5 Control Map Structure  The structure of thecontrol map is outside the scope of this document. Theuse of SEMI G81 or SEMI G85 standards isrecommended to describe map structures.15.6 Control Map Modifications  The option toupdate a control map to register sites as they areprocessed is a user specific detail. In the event thatcontrol maps are modified on the prober, the probermust support uploading the modified maps to the host."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 45 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E130-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 20049 16 Service Tasks16.1 The recipe on a PSEM300 compliant probercontains setup parameters and references to a collectionof service recipes. (See SEMI E42 for a description ofService Recipes). The host can issue a command toexecute a service task. The instructions for performingthe specified task are contained in the respective servicerecipe. This standard makes no attempt to define thefull list of service tasks available for a given equipment.However, when a service task is available, the supplieris responsible for documenting the command andparameters required for the host to request the task.When a service task is performed, the Process Statemodel transitions to the SERVICE TASK state andprovides the host with a descriptive TaskID.16.2 Inking16.2.1 The host can perform inking on individualdevices by issuing the INK-DEVICE command, or thehost can ink a list of devices by issuing the INK-DIEcommand and a die list. The die list parameter mayreference a Control Map containing the die selection.16.3 Inspecting16.3.1 There are several inspections the prober may becapable of performing such as inspecting the probes,inspecting ink marks, and inspecting the Probe to Padalignment. The supplier must document the inspectionsthat are supported and provide remote commands forselecting the designated inspection.16.3.2 The Inspection associated with the maintenanceactivity is not to be confused with the process ofInspecting as defined in this section. The activity ofinspecting the equipment in a maintenance capacitymay involve the use of subsystems including one ormore inspection process steps. While the use of aninspection subsystem in a process capacity constitutes atransition to the SERVICE TASK state, the equivalentuse of the same subsystem in a maintenance capacitydoes not.16.4 Probe Cleaning16.4.1 This document does not attempt to specify thefull set of probe cleaning features. However, thisdocument does require at minimum the ability todesignate logical zones within a cleaning media type toprevent cross-contamination between wafer technologytypes. The supplier must provide suitable meansthrough the use of Equipment Constants and StatusVariables to allow the user full selectivity of theavailable options. 17 Material Movement17.1 Between Substrate Locations (Inter-SubstrateMoves)17.1.1 Loading Substrates17.1.1.1 The host issues the LOAD-SUBSTRATEcommand to load the next substrate identified in thecurrent Process Jobs PRMtlNameList attribute onto thechuck. The order by which the substrates of a processjob are processed is fully defined within the ProcessJob.17.1.1.2 If the equipment is configured with a multi-stage pipeline, upon receiving the LOAD-SUBSTRATE command from the host, the equipmentwill fill the pipeline up to the point where the substrateto be processed is loaded onto the chuck and readied forprocessing. Subsequent LOAD-SUBSTRATEcommands will maintain a full pipeline as long asadditional substrates are available for processing. Thisassures continuous material flow.17.1.1.2.1 Example: if the equipment is configuredwith a two-stage pipeline consisting of a pre-align stageand a main chuck, A LOAD-SUBSTRATE commandissued by the host while the Process State model is inthe AWAITING LOAD state and the pipeline is emptywill cause the first substrate to be processed through thepre-align stage and onto the chuck. The next substratewill then be loaded onto the pre-align stage.17.1.2 Loading SubstratesSpanning Process JobBoundaries17.1.2.1 When the host issues the LOAD-SUBSTRATE command that moves the last substrateof the current Process Job out of the first pipeline stage(or chuck for non-pipelined configurations) and anotherProcess Job is defined with the PRProcessStart attributeset to TRUE, the equipment will automatically launchthe next Process Job. If Process Job preconditioning isnot required for the newly launched Process Job, thefirst substrate listed in the PRMtlNameList will beloaded into the first pipeline stage (or chuck for non-pipelined configurations).17.1.3 Loading SubstratesSubstrate State Model17.1.3.1 Substrate Tracking events (SEMI E90) mustbe available to the host. When a substrate is movedfrom the source carrier to the first pipeline stage (orchuck for non-pipelined configurations), the substratestate model will transition from AT SOURCE to ATWORK.17.1.3.2 When a substrate is loaded on the chuck, thesubstrate state model will transition from NEEDSPROCESSING to IN PROCESS for substrates thatwere not previously suspended (see Section 17.1.5 for"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 46 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E130-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2004 10 a description of suspending substrates). A substratethat was suspended will already be in the IN PROCESSstate.17.1.4 Unloading Substrates17.1.4.1 LOAD-SUBSTRATE Command  When thehost issues the LOAD-SUBSTRATE command, thesubstrate currently occupying the chuck is removedfrom the chuck and placed in the destination substratelocation (This assumes that no additional post-chucksubstrate locations exist). The substrate state modeltransitions from the IN PROCESS to PROCESSEDstate. When the substrate is loaded in its destinationsubstrate location, the substrate transitions from the ATWORK to the AT DESTINATION state.17.1.4.2 UNLOAD-SUBSTRATE Command  Thehost issues the UNLOAD-SUBSTRATE command toremove the substrate from the chuck and place it in itsdestination substrate location leaving the chuckunoccupied. For pipelined configurations, thesubstrate(s) in the pipeline remain in their currentlocation. The state model for the substrate removedfrom the chuck transitions from the IN PROCESS toPROCESSED state. When the substrate is loaded in itsdestination substrate location, the substrate transitionsfrom the AT WORK to the AT DESTINATION state.This command cannot be used to suspend the substrateoccupying the chuck.17.1.4.3 UNLOAD-ALLSUBSTRATES Command The host issues the UNLOAD-ALLSUBSTRATEScommand to return all substrates occupying the chuckand pipeline stages to their respective carriers. Forpipelined configurations, substrates occupying a pre-chuck pipeline stage are returned to their sourcesubstrate location. The state model for these substratestransitions from the AT WORK to AT SOURCE statewhile remaining in the NEEDS PROCESSING state.17.1.4.3.1 UNLOAD-ALLSUBSTRATES withSUSPEND  If the host intends to continue processingthe substrate occupying the chuck, the host includes theSUSPEND parameter with the UNLOAD-ALLSUBSTRATES command. (See Section 17.1.5for a description of suspending substrates.)17.1.4.3.2 UNLOAD-ALLSUBSTRATES no SUSPEND If the host has completed processing the substrateoccupying the chuck, the host issues the UNLOAD-ALLSUBSTRATES without the SUSPEND parameter.The substrate occupying the chuck transitions from theIN PROCESS to PROCESSED state and is delivered tothe destination substrate location. When the substrate isloaded in the destination substrate location, thesubstrate transitions from the AT WORK to the ATDESTINATION state. 17.1.5 Suspending SubstratesNOTE 6: Substrate Suspending and Resuming are not JobControl collection events (e.g. CJ/PJ PAUSE/RESUME). Asubstrate can be suspended as part of a normal processinterrupt to allow a service task to be performed as directedby the host.17.1.5.1 The host can suspend processing on asubstrate in order to free the chuck for other purposessuch as performing diagnostics or maintenance. Asuspended substrate will be returned to its sourcesubstrate location and remains in the IN PROCESSstate. When the substrate is loaded into the sourcesubstrate location, the substrate transitions from the ATWORK to the AT SOURCE state.17.1.5.2 Suspending a substrate does not change theorder in which substrates are processed within a ProcessJob.17.1.5.3 The commands that result in a substrate beingsuspended are: UNLOAD-ALLSUBSTRATES withSUSPEND and LOAD-TEST-SUBSTRATE. It isexpected that additional capabilities may exist thatresult in a substrate being suspended (such as cleaningprobes with a cleaning disk).17.1.6 Resuming a Suspended Substrate17.1.6.1 A substrate that has been suspended will bethe first substrate loaded onto the chuck whenprocessing resumes.17.1.6.2 If a substrate was suspended automatically aspart of a service task, the equipment will automaticallyresume the suspended substrate prior to indicating thatthe service task has completed.17.1.6.3 If the host suspended a substrate by issuingthe UNLOAD-ALLSUBSTRATES with SUSPEND,the host resumes the suspended substrate by issuing theLOAD-SUBSTRATE command.17.2 Chuck Movement (Intra-Substrate Moves)17.2.1 When a control map is used to specify stepping,the INDEX Remote command must be used to move tothe next die location. When a control map is not used,either the MOVE, MOVE-ABS or MOVE-SUBSTEPRemote commands must be used to specify motion.17.2.2 Die coordinates are row and column numbers.Moving the wafer one row increases or decreases theDieYCoordinate by one. Moving the wafer one columnincreases or decreases the DieXCoordinate by one.Following an INDEX command the die coordinates canbe retrieved from the variables DieXCoordinate andDieYCoordinate."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 47 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E130-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 200411 17.2.3 The Z coordinate is zero if the wafer is out of contact (the chuck is down) with the probes and one if it is incontact (the chuck is up).17.2.4 The MOVE command specifies the number of rows and columns to move from the current position. Whenthe move is complete, DieXCoordinate will be changed to DieXCoordinate+X; DieYCoordinate will be changed toDieYCoordinate+Y. When the Z parameter is included in the MOVE command, a value of (Z = 1) moves thechuck to the down coordinate, a value of (Z = +1) moves the chuck to the up coordinate, and a value of (Z = 0)leaves the chuck in the starting Z coordinate.17.2.5 The MOVE-ABS command specifies the new die coordinates. When the move is complete, DieXCoordinatewill be changed to X; DieYCoordinate will be changed to Y; and the chuck will be down (Z = 0) or up (Z = 1).17.2.6 The MOVE-SUBSTEP remote command moves the substrate in units smaller than the die size. The stepresolution for the X,Y and Z axis is available for query from the equipment status variables MinXStep, MinYStepand MinZStep. X, Y, and Z are all relative motions in the specified units. The prober may apply an appropriatecompensation factor to adjust for thermal expansion, etc. 18 Coordinate System18.1 This standard provides a coordinate system capable of describing simple geometries.
