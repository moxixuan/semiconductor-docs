Figure 9
The Compound ESF defect is an epi stacking fault that has a broken surface, but maintains the square shape
of an ESF.  It typically scatters more light than a normal ESF because of the extra facets, so it is sized larger
in a SSIS. Magnification 500 times using Nomarski Interference Microscopy. Approximate SSIS event size:

Figure 11
A Polysilicon Epitaxial Stacking Fault is a defect that covers a large area and is covered or surrounded by
ESFs.  This classification is used when the surface appears to be poly-crystalline rather than single crystal.  It
is almost always a Large Area Defect and is caused by a large particle that may still be visible (see Buried
Particle).  Magnification 1500 times using Nomarski Interference Microscopy. Approximate SSIS event size,

6  Requirements
6. 1    As  a  minimum,  the  substrate  shall  conform  to
SEMI   M1   and   the   appropriate   individual   polished
monocrystalline silicon wafer standard.
6. 2  Epitaxial wafer defects shall not exceed the limit as
given in Table 1.
6. 2.1    Limits  for  slip,  which  may  require  destructive
testing,  shall  be  specified  in  a  purchase  order  together
with  an  appropriate  test  method.  In  the  absence  of
another  specification,  the  wafer  will  contain  no  slip
lines within the quality area. (See Table 1, Note 1.)
NOTE  7:    When  an  unetched  wafer  is  observed  for  slip  it  is
impossible to differentiate between slip and linear misfit lines.
6. 3  Layer  Thickness  Variation  ó  Unless  otherwise
specified,  the  thickness  variation  shall  be  determined
from   value   measured   at   the   center   and   locations
centered   12   mm   ±   1   mm   from   the   periphery,   on
diameters   both   parallel   and   perpendicular   to   the

6. 4  Layer  Net  Carrier  Density  Variation  ó  The  net
carrier   density   variation   shall   be   determined   from
values measured at the center and locations with center
of  the  probe  at  12  mm  ±  1  mm  from  the  periphery,  on
diameters   both   parallel   and   perpendicular   to   the

7  Test Methods and Measurements
7. 1    Measurements  shall  be  carried  out  in  conformance
with  the  specified  SEMI  Test  Methods.  Where  no
methods  are  specified  or  where  choices  are  given,  the
supplier  and  purchaser  shall  agree  in  advance  on  the
means for making the measurement.
7. 2  Substrates ó   Determine   in   accordance   with
methods specified in SEMI M1.
7. 3  Epitaxial Layer
7. 3.1  Thickness   ó   Determine   in   accordance   with
SEMI MF95 or SEMI MF110.
NOTE   8:      In   the   case   of   thin   layers   and   graded   doping
transitions,   SEMI   MF95   and   SEMI   MF110   may   not   be
suitable.  See  the  scopes  of  these  test  methods  to  determine
their limitations. In all cases, there is a possibility that various
types  of  infrared  reflectance  instrumentation  may  result  in
different  values  of  epitaxial  layer  thickness.  Therefore,  the
instrumentation  used  shall  be  agreed  upon  between  supplier
and purchaser.
7. 3.2  Net  Carrier  Density  ó  Determine  by  method(s)
agreed upon between supplier and purchaser.
NOTE 9:  SEMI MF1392 and SEMI MF1393 are methods for
measuring  net  carrier  density  using  a  mercury  probe  contact.
If  resistivity  is  measured,  as  by  SEMI  MF374  or  SEMI
MF525,  conversion  to  dopant  density  shall  be  made  using
SEMI  MF723.  Net  carrier  density  of  very  heavily  doped
layers  (or  substrates)  may  be  found  using  SEMI  MF398.  Net
carrier   density   profiles   may   be   determined   directly   in
accordance   with   SEMI   MF1392   or   SEMI   MF1393   or
indirectly  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF672,  with  conversion
from  resistivity  to  net  carrier  density  in  accordance  with
SEMI  MF723.  If  the  method  used  for  determining  the  net
carrier   density   profile   is   not   the   same   as   that   used   to
determine  the  center-point  net  carrier  density,  correlation
between the two methods used shall be established.
7. 3.3  Epitaxial    Wafer    Defects    ó    Determine    in
accordance with the methods given in Table 1.
7. 3.3.1    Surface  inspection  shall  be  performed  before
any  other  testing.  Wafers  may  be  cleaned  prior  to
inspection    to    minimize    difficulty    in    the    visual
inspection of defects other than foreign matter.
7. 3.3.2  Slip ó  Determine  by  methods  agreed  upon
between supplier and purchaser.
7. 3.3.3  Automatic   surface   inspection   technology   is
being  developed  to  detect  and  discriminate  surface
defects.    The  extended  definitions  in  Section  4.3  are
intended to facilitate this development.
NOTE  10:    For  observation  of  gross  slip,  examination  of  the
epitaxial  layer  under  the  illumination  conditions  specified  in
Section   12.2   of   SEMI   MF523   may   suffice.   For   more
demanding  applications,  it  may  be  desirable  to  etch  the
surface in accordance with SEMI MF1726 prior to the visual
inspection.
7. 4      If   substrates   of   different   type   and   net   carrier
density  than  the  product  substrates  are  to  be  used  for
deposition  control,  their  type,  resistivity,  and  quantity
per run or lot shall be agreed upon between supplier and
purchaser.

NOTE 6: For observation of gross slip, examine the epitaxial layer under illumination conditions specified in Section 12.2 of SEMI MF523. For
more demanding applications, it may be desirable to etch the surface in accordance with SEMI MF1726.
NOTE  7:  In  todayís  technology,  it  may  be  possible  to  do  this  inspection  using  automated  laser  scanning  systems;  however,  a  standard  test
procedure has yet to be developed. Application of automated inspection must be agreed upon between supplier and user.

8  Sampling
8. 1      Unless   otherwise   specified,   appropriate   sample
sizes  shall  be  selected  from  each  lot  according  to
ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4-1993.  Quality  characteristics  shall
be   assigned   an   acceptable   quality   level   (AQL)   in
accordance  with  ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4-1993.  Inspection
levels   shall   be   agreed   upon   between   supplier   and
purchaser. Accept and reject criteria are to be based on
defective wafers, not on defective characteristics.
8. 2    Unless  otherwise  specified,  the  following  AQLís
shall be assigned:
8. 2.1      Epitaxial   Layer   Center-point   Thickness   and
Variation, 1%;
8. 2.2    Epitaxial  Layer  Center  Net  Carrier  Density  and
Variation, 1%;
8. 2.3  Epitaxial Wafer Defects, Cumulative, 2.5%.
9  Certification
9. 1    Upon  request  of  the  purchaser  in  the  contract  or
order,  a  manufacturerís  or  supplierís  certification  that
the material was manufactured and tested in accordance
with this specification, together with a report of the test
results, shall be furnished at the time of shipment.
9. 2    The  supplier  and  purchaser  may  agree  that  the
material  shall  be  certified  as  ìcapable  of  meetingî
certain   requirements.   In   this   context,   ìcapable   of
meetingî  shall  signify  that  the  supplier  is  not  required
to  perform  the  appropriate  tests  in  Section  7;  however,
if the purchaser performs the test and the material fails
to meet the requirement, the material may be subject to
rejection.
10  Packing and Marking
10. 1    Special  packing  requirements  shall  be  subject  to
agreement  between  the  supplier   and   the   purchaser.
Otherwise  all  wafers  shall  be  handled,  inspected,  and
packed   in   such   a   manner   as   to   avoid   chipping,
scratches,  and  contamination,  and  in  accordance  with
the best industry practices to provide protection against
damage during shipment.


SEMI M11-0704 © SEMI 1988, 2004 17
10. 2    The  wafers  supplied  under  this  specification  shall  be  identified  by  appropriately  labeling  the  outside  of  each
box or container and each subdivision thereof in which it may reasonably be expected that the wafers will be stored
prior  to  further  processing.  Identification  shall  include  supplierís  name  and  reference  number,  purchaserís  p.o.
number,  quantity,  dopant,  orientation,  conductivity  type  of  substrates  and  epitaxial  layers,  carrier  density,  and
thickness  of  the  epitaxial  layer.  The  reference  number  assigned  by  the  supplier  shall  provide  ready  access  to
information concerning the fabrication history of the particular wafers in that lot. Such information shall be retained
on file at the manufacturerís facility for at least one year after that particular lot has been shipped.
11  Guides
11. 1  The specifications in the epitaxial guides are examples which were formed by a consensus of viewpoints. They
may or may not be used as a foundation to specify an epitaxial wafer for use in device manufacture. Their usefulness
can be increased by considering the guides prior to developing a device design or process. The required specification
is  deter-mined  by  the  device  and  the  process  design,  the  guides  are  suggestions  from  which  a  specification  can
evolve.
11. 2  An epitaxial guide can be viewed as a generic epitaxial wafer specification or as an example of a specification.
These  tables  provide  common  epitaxial  wafer  characteristics  which  describe  starting  wafers  useful  for  the
manufacture of some twin tub CMOS devices.
11. 3  The guides in Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 provide a series of options intended to increase the awareness of
epitaxial specifications and to provide information from which a specification can be formulated.
11. 4    SEMI  M18  was  used  as  a  template  for  formulating  these  tables.  When  suitable  to  the  application,  the  guides
can be used intact, reducing the proliferation of specifications and formats.
11. 4.1  Table 3 is representative of 1.0 μm design rule epitaxial wafer criteria.
11. 4.2  Table 4 is typical of an epitaxial wafer criteria for custom twin tub CMOS, 0.35 μm design rule devices, such
as, but not limited to ASICís, FPGAís, linears, DSPís, and microprocessors.
11. 4.3  Table 5 is typical of an epitaxial wafer criteria for 0.35 μm design rule devices such as 64 megabit DRAMís.
11. 4.4    Table  6  is  typical  of  epitaxial  wafer  criteria  for  twin  tub  CMOS,  0.25  μm  design  rule  devices,  such  as,  but
not limited to ASICís, FPGAís, linears, DSPís, and microprocessors.
11. 4.5  Table 7 is typical of epitaxial wafer criteria for twin tub CMOS, 0.18 μm design rule devices.
11. 4.6  Table 8 is typical of epitaxial wafer substrate criteria for a wafer pre-epitaxial that will be used in twin tub
CMOS, 0.25 μm design rule devices.
11. 4.7  Table 9 is typical of epi wafer criteria for twin tub CMOS, 0.13 μm design rule devices.
11. 4.8  Table 10 is typical of epi wafer criteria that can be used to develop a wafer specification for 90 nm Design
Rule CMOS devices.

NOTE 1: * indicates substrate specification.
NOTE 2: NS is the abbreviation for Not Specified.
NOTE 3: Non-destructive metrology did not exist at the time this document was approved.
NOTE 4: The site size is 25 mm ◊ 32 mm. Partial sites are included. The metrology was being developed at the time this document was being
balloted.
NOTE 5: These values are mathematically consistent.  The 0.09 μm count limit was transformed using draft international standard: ISO 14644-1
which follows the equation: 112 counts per wafer

= 200 counts per wafer

/(0.12 μm /0.09 μm)
2
.
NOTE 6: The process control capability is expected to be: ≤ 500 @ ≥ 0.25 μm.
NOTE  7:  Large  Area  Defects  (LADís)  are  surface  imperfections  or  particles  that  have  geometry  with  at  least  one  side  or  diameter  that  is  a
minimum of 1 micron in length .
NOTE 8: Tested per SEMI MF1726; a depth < 100 nm is acceptable.
NOTE 9: Only process control data is required.  Data not required on Certificate of Compliance.
NOTE 10: The first column under item references SEMI M18.  M18 was in the process of substantial revision at the time this documented  was
balloted.  Many M18 line references remain to be determined. TBD is the abbreviation for ìto be determinedî.
NOTE 11: The intent in specifying carrier density using a range, rather than the center nominal with tolerance accompanied by a wafer variation
limit, is to minimize the importance of edge variations and to emphasize meeting the range of carrier density as it is allowed by the process and
the designers.

NOTE  1:  The  first  column  under  item  references  SEMI  Standard  M18.    M18  was  in  the  process  of  substantial  revision  at  the  time  this
documented was balloted.  Many M18 line references remain to be determined. TBD is the abbreviation for ìto be determinedî.
NOTE 2: Unless otherwise agreed upon for a specific characteristic or test method.
NOTE  3:  Only  process  control  data  is  required.    Data  not  required  on  Certificate  of  Compliance.  A  larger  warp  value  may  be  appropriate  if  a
oxide layer is deposited on the back of the substrate.
NOTE  4:  Oxygen  level  in  itself  should  not  be  specified  but  rather  is  only  a  control  parameter  that  may  give  an  indication  of  the  amount  of
precipitation  that  will  occur  after  some  thermal  process  that  nucleates  and  grows  Bulk  Micro-defects  generated  at  precipitates.    Addition  of
nitrogen or carbon (above the background level) to the crystal can enhance the growth of these precipitates.
NOTE 5: Test in accordance with SEMI MF1188, JEIDA 61, or DIN 50438/1. Also see SEMI M44.
NOTE 6: Test in accordance with SEMI MF1366 or Gas Fusion Analysis, as agreed between supplier and purchaser.  Non-destructive metrology
did not exist at the time this document was approved.
NOTE 7: Test in accordance with SEMI MF951, Plan A1, A2, or A3, as agreed between supplier and purchaser.
NOTE 8: Non-destructive metrology did not exist at the time this document was approved.
NOTE 9: The 9-point TTV parameter has been replaced by GBIR.  See 12.4a.
NOTE 10: SFQR with a site size of 26 mm ◊ 8 mm is approximately equal to SFSR with a site size of 26 mm x 32 mm at the 90 nm technology
level. The smaller site allows more coverage of the FQA than the larger site. The value of site flatness of 90 nm is taken from the ITRS Starting
Materials Table.
NOTE  11:  The  90  nm  count,  238,  may  be  transformed  to  another  maximum  LLS  count  using  draft  international  standard:  ISO/DIS  14644-1
which  uses  the  equation:    count  per  wafer  at  65  nm  (new  minimum  size)

=    (count  per  wafer  at  90  nm)

*(90  nm  /  65  nm)
2.
.    For  example
converting from a 90 nm minimum size to a 65 nm minimum size yields a count of 456.
NOTE 12: This specification implies a polished back surface.
NOTE 13: The intent in specifying carrier density using a range, rather than the center nominal with tolerance accompanied by a wafer variation
limit, is to minimize the importance of edge variations and to emphasize meeting the range of carrier density as it is allowed by the process and
the designers.
NOTE 14: Large Area Defects (LADs) are surface imperfections or particles that have geometry with at least one side or diameter that is equal to
or greater than the layer thickness.  Their actual size cannot be currently implied from the output of an SSIS.
NOTE 15: Slip tested in accordance with SEMI MF1726; an etch depth < 100 nm is acceptable.  The metrology used for slip determination is a
major  factor  in  determining  the  presence  or  absence  of  slip  lines.    X-ray  Topography  is  much  more  sensitive  than  the  ASTM  etching  and
microscopic  inspection  method  given  here  but  no  Standard  Test  Method  currently  exists.    X-ray  Topography  will  detect  slip  that  may  not
penetrate to the near surface region where the device is fabricated.  Use of SSIS equipment set at less ≤90 nm can also reveal slip lines on epi
wafers but again no Standard Test Method currently exists.  Surface roughness may interfere with SSIS measurements.  With the thermal cycles
employed in 90 nm technology thermal processes, slip propagation should not be a problem.
NOTE 16: Value from the 2003 ITRS 90 nm node.
NOTE  17:  May  include  stacking  faults  of  different  scattering  intensities  and  other  structural  epitaxial  defects  which  are  not  correctly  sized  by
current generation SSISs.

SEMI M12-1103 © SEMI 1988, 2003 1
SEMI M12-1103
SPECIFICATION FOR SERIAL ALPHANUMERIC MARKING OF THE
FRONT SURFACE OF WAFERS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Traceability  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Traceability  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  July  27,  2003.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  October
2003; to be published November 2003.  Originally published in 1988; previously published March 2003.
1  Purpose
1. 1  This  specification  provides  a  serial  alphanumeric
marking of silicon or other semiconductor wafers.  The
wafer  serial  number  links  the  properties  of  the  wafer
stored   in   an   appropriate   database   system   to   each
individual  wafer  for  purposes  of  tracking  and  control
during wafer and device manufacture.
1. 2    By  defining  the  basic  code  used  for  the  mark,  this
specification  ensures  the  consistency  of  wafer  marking
performed  by  wafer  manufacturers.    Thus,  it  allows
simplification   of   the   performance   requirements   of
automatic  optical  character  reading  (OCR)  equipment,
provides    for    unassisted    and    immediate    human
readability   without   wafer   handling,   and   facilitates
resolution of wafer level process variations.
1. 3    The  marking  code  is  intended  to  be  valid  for  a
broad range of wafer products (i.e., epi, SOI, processed
polished wafers, etc.).
2  Scope
2. 1  This specification defines the geometric and spatial
limits  of  the  alphanumeric  code,  specifically  for  serial
identification of flatted and notched silicon wafers.
2. 2    This  specification  does  NOT  address  the  marking
techniques that may be employed when complying with
this standard.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

6  Alphanumeric Code
6. 1  The code consists of one line of 12 characters. The first eight characters are an identification number which is
unique  to  the  wafer  for  a  given  vendor.  These  characters  may  be  alphanumeric  except  character  8  which  must  be
numeric  (see  Table  2).  Characters  9  and  10  comprise  the  supplier  identification  code  (see  SEMI  AUX001
1
).
Characters 11 and 12 are check characters (see Section 9). These check characters are machine generated for code
acceptance and reading verification.

9  Alphanumeric Error-Detecting Method
9. 1    The  alphanumeric  check  characters  in  character
locations  11  and  12  are  a  required  part  of  the  Code
defined in this specification.
9. 2  All single-character substitution errors are detected.
9. 3    All  two-character  transposition  errors  are  detected
for any message up to 58 characters in length.
9. 4    The  character  set  may  be  expanded  to  include  the
first 59 characters of the ASCII 64-character set.
9. 5    There  exist  simple  recursive  algorithms  for  error
detection  and  check  character  generation  that  do  not
require the use of multiplication or division.
9. 6  Definition of the Error-Detecting Method
9. 6.1    For  the  purpose  of  describing  the  error-detecting
method, we define the following symbols:
• A
i
represents the ith ASCII character.
• a
i
represents the numerical value assigned to A
i
.
9. 6.2  The characters are numbered from left to right, so
that the message is given by
A
1
A
2
A
3
...A
12

9. 6.3      A   complete   description   of   the   error-detecting
method is given by the following seven rules:
9. 6.3.1    The  numerical  value  a
i
is  found  by  subtracting
32  from  the  ASCII  decimal  representation  of  A
i
(refer
to Table 4 — Character Values).
9. 6.3.2    An  ASCII  character  A
i
is  allowed  only  if  its
numerical value a
i
is one of
0,1, 2,...58.

9. 6.3.3    The  check  character  A
11
must  be  one  of  the
ASCII characters A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H.
9. 6.3.4    The  check  character  A
12
must  be  one  of  the
ASCII characters 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
9. 6.3.5  The check character pair A
11
A
12
may not be one
of the combinations H3, H4, H5, H6, H7.
9. 6.3.6      When   the   message   is   written,   the   check
characters  A
11
and  A
12
are  chosen  such  that  59  divides
the expression
8
11
a
1
+8
10
a
2
...+8
2
a
10
+8a
11
+a
12

without a remainder.
9. 6.3.7    If,  on  reading  the  message,  59  does  not  evenly
divide   the   expression   given   above,   an   error   has
occurred.

9. 7  Suggestions   for   Implementation   —   The   error-
detecting   method   can   be   implemented   directly   by
calculating  the  expression  given  above,  and  the  check
characters    can    be    found    by    exhaustive    search.
However,  this  approach  is  unnecessarily  complex;  a
decrease   in   complexity   can   be   made   by   taking
advantage of three simple observations.


SEMI M12-1103 © SEMI 1988, 2003 6
9. 7.1      First,   since   we   are   interested   only   in   the
remainder of the final expression after dividing it by 59,
we    can    avoid    working    with    large    numbers    by
subtracting  59  repeatedly  after  each  operation  until  the
result is less than 59.
9. 7.2      Second,   we   can   rearrange   the   error-detecting
expression, using Horner's Rule, to form
a
12
+8 a
11
+...8a
3
+8a
2
+8a
1
()
()
...
()

which can be calculated recursively from the inside out
by successive multiplication and addition.
9. 7.3          Third,     multiplication     by     eight     can     be
accomplished  by  adding  a  quantity  to  itself  three  times
in succession.
9. 8  An Algorithm for Error Detection
9. 8.1        When    implementing    error    detection,    it    is
convenient  to  imagine  a  checksum  for  each  individual
character position. This partial checksum forms a check
on  all  preceding  characters,  as  well  as  the  present
character.  Then  using  Horner's  Rule,  one  can  calculate
a  running  checksum  (that  is,  calculate  each  partial
checksum   in   order).   This   leads   to   the   following
algorithm.
9. 8.2    Add  the  checksum  (or  the  previous  character
position  to  itself.  (For  the  first  character  position,  the
value of the previous checksum is zero.) If the result is
59  or  greater,  subtract  59.  This  leaves  a  value  in  the
range 0–58.
9. 8.3  Add the result of step 1 to itself. If the result is 59
or greater, subtract 59.
9. 8.4  Add the result of step 2 to itself. If the result is 59
or  greater,  subtract  59.  The  result  of  this  step  is  eight
times the previous position checksum, modulo 59.
9. 8.5  Add the result of step 3 to the numerical value of
the  character  in  the  present  position.  If  the  result  is  59
or  greater,  subtract  59.  The  result  of  this  step  is  the
checksum for the present character position.
9. 8.6      Repeat   steps   1   through   4   for   each   character
position. If the checksum for the final character position
is nonzero, an error has occurred.
9. 9  An Algorithm for Generating the Check Characters
— The check characters can be generated as follows:
9. 9.1  Initially, assume that the check characters are A0
(the  first  check  character  is  the  letter  A,  the  second  is
the numeral 0).
9. 9.2      Calculate   the   final   checksum   in   the   manner
described above for error detection. If the result is zero,
the  check  characters  are  correct,  and  the  algorithm
terminates.
9. 9.3  If the result of step 2 is nonzero, subtract it from
59, yielding a number in the range 1–58.
9. 9.4  Convert the result of step 3 to binary.
9. 9.5    Add  the  least  significant  three  bits  of  the  binary
number  to  the  numerical  value  of  the  second  assumed
check  character  0  (numeral  zero).  This  will  yield  a
value  that  corresponds  to  an  ASCII  character  in  the
range 0–7.
9. 9.6  Add the next higher three bits of the binary num-
ber  to  the  numerical  value  of  the  first  assumed  check
character  A.  This  will  yield  a  numerical  value  that
corresponds to an ASCII character in the range A–H.
9. 10  An  Illustrative  Example  —  For  the  purpose  of
illustrating  the  check  character  generating  algorithm,
assume    that    the    message    consists    of    only    two
characters, the numerals 2 and 3.
9. 10.1  Initially, assume that the check characters are A
and 0 (zero) yielding the composite message 23A0.
9. 10.2    Using  the  algorithm  described  above,  the  final
checksum is found to be 33. Since this is nonzero, it is
subtracted  from  59,  yielding  26  in  decimal,  or  011010
in binary.
9. 10.3    The  least  significant  three  bits  010  (decimal
value  2)  added  to  the  numerical  value  of  the  ASCII
character  0  (numeral  zero),  which  is  16,  yields  18  (the
numerical value of the ASCII character 2).
9. 10.4  The next higher three bits 011 (decimal value 3)
added to the numerical value of the ASCII character A,
which  is  33,  yields  36  (the  numerical  value  of  the
ASCII  character  D).  The  final  composite  message  is
23D2.

R1-1  Considerations for Reliable Automatic
Reading of the Marking
R1-1.1    The  following  suggestions  are  offered  to  assist
in  assuring  the  most  reliable  automatic  reading  of  the
alphanumeric marking.
R1-1.2  Character  Stroke  Thickness  —  If  a  5  ×  9  dot
matrix  is  chosen  for  marking,  it  is  recommended  that
the  minimum  dot  size  be  0.100  mm.  Double  or  higher
density  dot  matrix  is  recommended  —  when  used,
smaller   dot   diameters   may   be   employed.   Stroke
thickness should be constant within 20% over the entire
character   set   so   that   the   reader   settings   may   be
optimized for the specific wafer run.
R1-1.3  Contrast    —    The    character    should    have
sufficient   contrast   to   be   legible.   Contrast   may   be
affected by depth and other conditions.
R1-1.4  Clear  Zone  —  It  is  recommended  that  the  area
immediately  beneath  and  a  minimum  of  0.500  mm
around    the    marking    characters    be    of    uniform
reflectivity  and  free  of  any  lithography  and  process
overlay edges.
R1-2  Considerations for the Use of Front
Surface Markings
R1-2.1    Marks  can  impinge  upon  areas  where  devices
may  be  printed.  Since  mask  geometries  are  varied,
considerations of the mark area should be made in mask
design  and  also  when  applying  the  mark  specifications
to existing mask designs.
R1-2.2    When  the  mark  is  applied  prior  to  epitaxial
deposition,  a  crown  or  epi  may  grow  along  the  mark
edge. The height of this crown will depend upon the epi
thickness and the deposition process.
NOTICE:      SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or

SPECIFICATION FOR ALPHANUMERIC MARKING OF SILICON
WAFERS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Traceability  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Traceability  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American Silicon Wafer Committee on July 27, 2003.  Initially available at www.semi.org October 2003; to
be published November 2003.  Originally published in 1988; previously published in September 1998.
1  Purpose
1. 1        This    specification    describes    an    alphanumeric
marking  system  for  silicon  wafers.    The  marking  code
includes    information    on    the    origin,    approximate
resistivity,    dopant    species,    and    crystal    growth
orientation in addition to a wafer identification number.
Use  of  this  specification  ensures  the  consistency  of  all
wafer  marking  performed  by  silicon  manufacturers.
This     consistency     allows     simplification     of     the
performance    requirements    of    Automatic    Optical
Character Reading (OCR) equipment.
1. 2  By defining the basic code used to characterize the
individual    wafer,    this    specification    provides    the
information needed for practical operator interpretation.
2  Scope
2. 1        This    specification    defines    the    character    set,
location,  and  associated  dimensions  and  tolerances  of
an  alphanumeric  code,  specifically  for  identification  of
flatted and notched silicon wafers.
2. 2    This  specification  does  not  address  the  marking
techniques that may be employed when complying with
this standard.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

7  Alphanumeric Error-Detecting Method


7. 1    The  alphanumeric  check  characters  in  character
locations  17  and  18  are  a  required  part  of  the  Code
defined in this specification.
7. 2  All single-character substitution errors are detected.
7. 3    All  two-character  transposition  errors  are  detected
for any message up to 58 characters in length.
7. 4  The character set may be expanded into the first 59
characters of the ASCII 64-character set.
7. 5    There  exist  simple  recursive  algorithms  for  error
detection  and  check  character  generation  that  do  not
require the use of multiplication or division.
7. 6  Definition of the Error-Detecting Method
7. 6.1    For  the  purpose  of  describing  the  error-detecting
method, we define the following symbols:
• A
i
represents the i
th
ASCII character.
• a
i
represents the numerical value assigned to A
i
.
7. 6.2      The  characters  are  numbered  from  left  to  right,
so that the message is given by
A
1
A
2
A
3
...A
18
.

7. 6.3      A   complete   description   of   the   error-detecting
method is given by the following seven rules:
7. 6.3.1    The  numerical  value  a
i
is  found  by  subtracting
32  from  the  ASCII  decimal  representation  of  A
i
(refer
to Table 4).
7. 6.3.2    An  ASCII  character  A
i
is  allowed  only  if  its
numerical value a
i
is one of
0,1, 2,..., 58.

7. 6.3.3    The  check  character  A
17
must  be  one  of  the
ASCII characters A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H.
7. 6.3.4    The  check  character  A
18
must  be  one  of  the
ASCII characters 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
7. 6.3.5    The  check  character  pair  A
17
A
18
may  not  be
one of the combinations H3, H4, H5, H6, H7.
7. 6.3.6      When   the   message   is   written,   the   check
characters  A
17
and  A
18
are  chosen  such  that  59  divides
the expression
8
17
a
1
+8
16
a
2
... + 8
2
a
16
+8a
17
+a
18

without a remainder.
7. 6.3.7    If,  on  reading  the  message,  59  does  not  evenly
divide   the   expression   given   above,   an   error   has
occurred.
7. 7  Suggestions   for   Implementation   —   The   error-
detecting   method   can   be   implemented   directly   by
calculating  the  expression  given  above,  and  the  check
characters can be found by exhaustive search. However,
this  approach  is  unnecessarily  complex;  a  decrease  in
complexity  can  be  made  by  taking  advantage  of  three
simple observations.
7. 7.1    First,  since  we  are  interested  only  in  the  remain-
der  of  the  final  expression  after  dividing  it  by  59,  we
can  avoid  working  with  large  numbers  by  subtracting
59 repeatedly after each operation until the result is less
than 59.


SEMI M13-1103 © SEMI 1988, 2003 7
7. 7.2      Second,   we   can   rearrange   the   error-detecting
expression, using Horner's Rule, to form
a
18
+ 8(a
16
+ ...8(a
3
+ 8(a
2
+8a
1
))...)

which can be calculated recursively from the inside out
by successive multiplication and addition.
7. 7.3    Third,  multiplication  by  eight  can  be  accom-
plished  by  adding  a  quantity  to  itself  three  times  in
succession.
7. 8  An Algorithm for Error Detection
7. 8.1  When implementing error detection, it is conven-
ient to imaging a checksum for each individual charac-
ter position. This partial checksum forms a check on all
preceding  characters,  as  well  as  the  present  character.
Then,  using  Horner's  Rule,  one  can  calculate  a  "run-
ning"  checksum  (that  is,  calculate  each  partial  check-
sum in order). This leads to the following algorithm.
7. 8.2    Add  the  checksum  for  the  previous  character
position  to  itself.  (For  the  first  character  position,  the
value of the previous checksum is zero.) If the result is
59  or  greater,  subtract  59.  This  leaves  a  value  in  the
range 0-58.
7. 8.3    Add  the  result  of  Step  1  to  itself.  If  the  result  is
59 or greater, subtract 59.
7. 8.4    Add  the  result  of  Step  2  to  itself.  If  the  result  is
59 or greater, subtract 59. The result of this step is eight
times the previous position checksum, modulo 59.
7. 8.5  Add the result of Step 3 to the numerical value of
the  character  in  the  present  position.  If  the  result  is  59
or  greater,  subtract  59.  The  result  of  this  step  is  the
checksum for the present character position.
7. 8.6    Repeat  Steps  1  through  4  for  each  character
position. If the checksum for the final character position
is nonzero, an error has occurred.
7. 9  An Algorithm for Generating the Check Characters
— The check characters may be generated as follows:
7. 9.1  Initially, assume that the check characters are A0
(the  first  check  character  is  the  letter  A,  the  second  is
the numeral 0).
7. 9.2      Calculate   the   final   checksum   in   the   manner
described above for error detection. If the result is zero,
the  check  characters  are  correct,  and  the  algorithm
terminates.
7. 9.3  If the result of Step 2 is nonzero, subtract it from
59, yielding a number in the range 1–58.
7. 9.4  Convert the result of Step 3 to binary.
7. 9.5    Add  the  least  significant  three  bits  of  the  binary
number  to  the  numerical  value  of  the  second  assumed
check  character  0  (zero).  This  will  yield  a  value  that
corresponds to an ASCII character in the range 0–7.
7. 9.6  Add the next higher three bits of the binary num-
ber  to  the  numerical  value  of  the  first  assumed  check
character  A.  This  will  yield  a  numerical  value  that
corresponds to an ASCII character in the range A–H.
7. 10  An  Illustrative  Example  —  For  the  purpose  of
illustrating  the  check  character  generating  algorithm,
assume    that    the    message    consists    of    only    two
characters,  the  digits  2  and  3.  Initially,  assume  that  the
check   characters   are   A   and   0   (zero)   yielding   the
composite message 23A0.
7. 10.1  Initially, assume that the check characters are A
and 0 (zero) yielding the composite message 23A0.
7. 10.2    Using  the  algorithm  described  above,  the  final
checksum is found to be 33. Since this is nonzero, it is
subtracted  from  59,  yielding  26  in  decimal,  or  011010
in binary.
7. 10.3    The  least  significant  three  bits  010  (decimal
value  2)  added  to  the  numerical  value  of  the  ASCII
character 0 (zero), which is 16, yields 18 (the numerical
value of the ASCII character 2).
7. 10.4  The final composite message is 23D2. The next
higher  three  bits  (011)  (decimal  value  3)  added  to  the
numerical value of the ASCII character A, which is 33,
yields  36  (the  numerical  value  of  the  ASCII  character
D).
