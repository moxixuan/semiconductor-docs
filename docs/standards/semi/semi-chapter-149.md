correction  factor  for  such  geometries  varies  rapidly
with thickness (see Section 8.6).
8. 3.1  Because   of   the   relative   insensitivity   of   the
calculated  center-point  resistivity  to  the  exact  value  of
diameter   for   large   diameter   wafers,   it   is   usually
adequate  to  assume  the  nominal  diameter  of  standard
commercially  available  wafers  specified  in  accordance
with  SEMI  M1.    However,  diameter  correction  factors
are     usually     required     for     off-center     resistivity
measurements  made  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF81.
When required, diameter measurements should be made
at the positions outlined in SEMI MF2074.
8. 4
Axial  Resistivity  Uniformity  —  The  uniformity  of
the resistivity along the crystal axis is important for all
applications   in   which   the   sampling   volume   of   the
measuring  instrument  in  the  direction  perpendicular  to
the wafer surface is different from that of the certifying
or   calibrating   instrument.      In   addition,   gross   axial
uniformity along a crystal section may be ascertained in
order  to  qualify  the  section  as  a  source  of  resistivity
reference  wafers  of  a  particular  resistivity  prior  to
slicing the section.
8. 4.1  Very  crude  indications  of  the  range  of  center-
point   resistivity   within   a   crystal   section   may   be
obtained  from  measurements  made  on  the  ends  of  the
section  in  accordance  with  the  Four-probe  Method  of
SEMI  MF43.    While  these  measurements  provide  a
useful  preliminary  screen  for  the  crystal  section,  they
cannot   be   relied   upon   to   give   accurate   values   of
resistivity.
8. 4.2  Somewhat    more    accurate    but    still    gross
indications   of   axial   resistivity   uniformity   may   be
obtained  from  measurements  of  the  resistivity  at  the
center  of  wafers  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF84  as  a
function of position along the crystal section.  However,
because of local fluctuations in dopant incorporation as
the  crystal  was  grown,  this  procedure  does  not  yield
reliable information about the center-point resistivity of
any wafer that is not measured.  In addition, it does not
yield information about the local variation in resistivity
as  a  function  of  depth  from  the  wafer  surface,  even  if
center-point resistivity measurements are made on each
wafer in the section.
8. 4.3  For   use   in   connection   with   measurements   in
which  the  sampling  volume  differs  from  the  sampling
volume   of   an   in-line   four-point   probe   with   1.59
[10/(2π)]  mm  spacing  as  specified  in  SEMI  MF84,
transfer   accuracy   is   affected   by   local   resistivity
uniformity.    In  particular,  the  resistivity  in  the  near-
surface   region   sampled   by   spreading   resistance   or
mercury   probes   may   differ   significantly   from   the
average  resistivity  of  the  resistivity  reference  wafer.
Depth profiles of resistivity near the wafer surface may
be obtained from spreading resistance measurements on
beveled sections in accordance with SEMI MF672.  To
obtain  depth  profiles  across  the  entire  wafer,  spreading
resistance  measurements  can  be  made  on  a  cleaved  or
polished   perpendicular   section;   special   fixtures   are
required for these measurements, which do not provide
the depth resolution of an angle beveled section.  Since
relative   measurements   only   are   required,   accurate
calibration  of  the  spreading  resistance  probe  is  not
necessary;   however,   linearity   is   important.      Two
difficulties  with  this  approach  must  be  recognized.
First,    if    beveled    specimens    are    employed,    the
possibility   of   mixing   the   vertical   and   horizontal
resistivity   variations   must   be   considered.      Second,
because   the   method   is   destructive,   the   resistivity
variation  of  the  actual  material  being  used  for  the
resistivity    reference    wafer    cannot    be    determined
directly  at  the  center  of  a  resistivity  reference  wafer;  it
can  only  be  inferred  from  measurements  on  nearby
sections or adjacent wafers.
8. 5
Radial Resistivity Uniformity — The uniformity of
the   resistivity   along   the   surface   of   the   resistivity
reference  wafer  is  important  for  all  applications  in
which  the  measuring  instrument  samples  a  different
area than the certifying or calibrating instrument.  Since
all resistivity measurements other than those conducted
in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF84,  including  four-point
probe  measurements  made  with  probes  with  different
probe-tip  spacing,  sample  different  areas,  this  factor  is
one  of  the  most  significant  limitations  in  transfer  of
resistivity values from one instrument to another.
8. 5.1  Large   scale   (macro)   variations   in   resistivity
across  the  surface  of  a  wafer  can  be  measured  with  a
four-point probe.
8. 5.1.1  Coarse indications can be obtained using an in-
line  four-point  probe  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF81
modified to yield a nine-site map of resistivity variation
over  the  central  38-mm  diameter  region  of  the  wafer.
In    addition    to    four-point    probes,    eddy    current
instruments      are      frequently      used      for      these
measurements.  Although the procedures for using eddy
current  instruments  for  measuring  resistivity  variation
are not standardized, they provide an adequate measure
of  radial  resistivity  variation,  especially  in  the  central
region   of   the   wafer   where   edge   effects   are   not
significant.    Although  more  dense  patterns  may  be
measured,   they   are   very   inconvenient    to    obtain
manually  using  either  a  four-point  probe  or  an  eddy
current instrument.
8. 5.1.2  Several     commercial     automated     mapping
instruments that utilize dual-configuration, in-line, four-

point  probes

or  square-array  four-point  probes
7
are
available.    These  instruments  provide  for  collection  of
sufficient  data  to  enable  determination  of  the  macro-
scale variation of the sheet resistance in detail adequate
for the application.  Measurements should be taken in a
49-site  pattern  consisting  of  the  center  point  and  sites
on  three  equally  spaced,  concentric  circles  as  specified
in SEMI MF1618.  In this pattern the inner, middle, and
outer circles have 8, 16, and 24 sites, respectively.  The
nominal  diameter  of  the  outer  circle  should  be  38  mm
(Note  5).    Procedures  for  measurements  with  square-
array  four-point  probes  have  not  been  standardized.
Dual-configuration    sheet    resistance    measurements
using   in-line   four-point   probes   should   be   made   in
accordance  with  SEMI  MF1529.    Since  the  thickness
correction    factor    is    not    established    for    dual-
configuration     probes,     the     resistivity     at     each
measurement   site   cannot   be   calculated   accurately.
However,    provided    that    the    wafer    thickness    is
sufficiently    uniform,    determination    of    the    sheet
resistance   is   adequate   for   this   application   because
relative  values  are  all  that  are  required  to  establish  the
variation.
8. 5.2  Micro-scale  variations  in  resistivity  across  the
surface  of  a  wafer  can  be  established  by  means  of
spreading resistance measurements made in accordance
with   SEMI   MF525.      It   is   especially   important   to
minimize  such  variations  in  material  to  be  used  as
resistivity   reference   wafers   for   spreading   resistance
calibrations.  Because of the high density of data points
required to obtain information on micro-scale variations
over  a  meaningful  area,  long  times  are  required  for
making these measurements.
NOTE 5:  If it is desired to qualify a larger area of a wafer for
use in preparing chip sets for spreading resistance calibration,
the  uniformity  of  both  resistivity  and  thickness  should  be
determined   over   the   larger   area   of   the   wafer.      For
determinations  of  macro-scale  radial  resistivity  uniformity,  it
is  recommended  that,  as  a  minimum,  the  site  density  used  in
evaluating the central region of the wafer (see Section 8.5.1.2)
be  maintained.    Table  1  lists  the  minimum  number  of  sites
required   for   areas   of   various   diameters.      Micro-scale
variations should also be determined over the larger area, but
because   it   is   impractical   to   make   detailed   micro-scale
variation  measurements  on  each  wafer,  each  chip  should  be
evaluated for micro-scale resistivity variations prior to use.

8. 6  Wafer  Thickness  —  Resistivity  reference  wafers
should be thick enough to avoid extreme fragility and to
allow  determination  of  the  center-point  thickness  to
±0.25% but not too thick to require large corrections to
the  thin  wafer  equation  for  resistivity  (see  Section  R2-
3. 2).  A thickness of 625 to 875 μm is recommended for
resistivity  reference  wafers.    Wafers  with  thickness  as
small  as  500  μm  may  be  used,  but  particular  attention
must be given to control of the total thickness variation
(see Section 9.1.1).

8. 6.1  For  four-point  probes  with  1.59-mm  probe-tip
spacing  as  specified  in  SEMI  MF84,  the  thickness
correction   factor   is   within   0.5%   of   unity   for   test
specimens up to 875-μm thick.  For probes with 1.016-
mm  (40-mil)  spacing,  the  thickness  correction  is  about
1% for a test specimen thickness of 625 μm, increasing
to  about  5%  at  875  μm.    For  probes  with  0.635-mm
(25-mil) spacing, the thickness correction is about 7.5%
at  a  thickness  of  625  μm,  increasing  to  nearly  20%  at
875 μm.
8. 6.2  The thickness enters into the determination of the
resistivity   of   the   reference   wafer   directly   as   an
independent    factor.        Therefore    determination    of
thickness  should  be  made  as  accurately  as  possible.    If
manual   methods   are   used   for   determining   radial
resistivity  uniformity  (see  Section  8.5.1.1),  the  average
thickness   and   total   thickness   variation   should   be
determined  in  accordance  with  the  contactless  method
of Test Methods SEMI MF533 using the same sites for
the   thickness   and   resistivity   measurements.      This
method,  however,  has  only  marginal  precision  for  this
application.      If   automated   methods   are   used   for
determining  radial  resistivity  uniformity  (see  Section
8. 5.1.2),   the   average   thickness   and   total   thickness
variation should be determined over the central 38-mm
diameter  circle  (Note  5)  in  accordance  with  SEMI
MF1530.
8. 6.3  The  various  errors  in  resistivity  determination
that result from uncertainties in thickness are discussed
in Section R2-3.2.

8. 7  Wafer  Conductivity  Type  and  Surface  Orientation
—  For  control  of  four-point  probes  or  for  calibrating
eddy  current  probes,  conductivity  type  and  surface
orientation  do  not  influence  the  result.    In  this  case
these parameters should be chosen so as to provide the
most  uniform  specimens  available.    For  low  resistivity
reference wafers,
p-type (100) or (111) wafers are most
appropriate, while for high resistivity reference wafers,
n-type  (neutron  transmutation  doped)  wafers  of  either
orientation   are   preferred.      For   use   in   calibrating
mercury  probes,  the  conductivity  type  of  the  reference
wafers  must  match  that  of  the  specimens  to  be  tested.
For  use  in  calibrating  spreading  resistance  instruments,
the type and surface orientation of the reference wafers
must match those of the specimens to be tested.
NOTE 6:  When  uniformity  considerations  are  the  dominant
issue,   the   following   should   be   kept   in   mind.      At   low
resistivity,  wafers  cut  from  Cz  crystal  are  not  only  more
readily  available  but  probably  have  better  uniformity  than
wafers  cut  from  FZ  crystals.    Wafers  cut  from  MCz  crystals,
if  available,  may  be  an  acceptable  alternative  to  NTD  wafers
for  the  higher  resistivity  ranges.    In  general,  (100)  crystals
have  better  radial  resistivity  uniformity  than  (111)  crystals.
Also p-type  crystals  have  generally  better  radial  resistivity
uniformity than n-type crystals.
9  Preparation and Calibration of Resistivity
Reference Wafers
9. 1
Wafer  Preparation  —  Wafers  should  be  sliced
from   a   qualified   crystal   section   of   the   desired
resistivity, diameter, conductivity type, and orientation.
The  thickness  of  the  as-cut  wafers  should  be  at  least
100 μm  larger  than  the  desired  finished  thickness  to
allow  for  removal  of  25  μm  from  each  surface  during
both  etching  and  lapping.    Etching  immediately  after
slicing in either KOH etching solution (see Section 5.4)
or   etching   solution   (15   +   1)   (see   Section   5.5)   is
recommended  to  remove  damage  introduced  during
slicing.    Subsequent  lapping  with  5  to  9-μm  aluminum
oxide  abrasive  is  intended  to  provide  both  control  of
thickness variation and a uniform matte surface.
9. 1.1  The total thickness variation (TTV) of resistivity
reference  wafers  should  be  as  small  as  possible.    As  a
minimum,  the  reference  wafers  should  meet  the  TTV
requirement  of  ±1  %  of  the  center-point  thickness  as
specified  in  SEMI  MF84.    For  625-μm  thick  wafers,
this  would  require  TTV  ≤  12.5  μm.    In  most  cases,  it
should be possible to obtain lapped wafers with TTV ≤
6 μm over the entire wafer and TTV ≤ 3 μm (± 0.25%
of  the  center-point  thickness)  over  the  region  of  the
wafer  where  the  resistivity  uniformity  is  determined
(see  Section  8.5.1.2).    Etched  or  single-side  polished
wafers may have somewhat larger TTV.
9. 1.2  The  preferred  surface  finish  is  that  obtained  by
lapping  with  5-μm  alumina  powder  as  specified  in
SEMI  MF84;  generally  similar  results  can  be  obtained
by  lapping  with  alumina  powders  up  to  9  μm.    This
surface  finish  was  originally  chosen  to  provide  good
probe-tip   and   specimen-surface   wear   together   with
sufficient    smoothness    to    reduce    probe    wander.
9

However,   resistivity   reference   wafers   intended   for
calibration  of  mercury  probe  and  spreading  resistance
instruments  must  be  polished.    On  the  other  hand,  if
polished    wafers    are    used    for    four-point    probe
measurements,  difficulties  may  be  encountered  with
accumulated  probe  damage  and  the  resultant  contact
quality    degradation    or    surface    charge,    or    both.
However,  use  of  instruments  calibrated  with  lapped
resistivity   reference   wafers   for   measuring   polished
wafers  could  result  in  errors  because  the  electrical
thickness  may  be  different  for  lapped  and  polished
wafers of the same mechanical thickness.
NOTE 7:  An   unpublished   roughness-thickness   correlation
study has shown that the electrical thickness of lapped wafers
with root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness < 0.58 μm on
both  sides  does  not  differ  from  the  mechanical  thickness  by
more than 2.5 μm.
9. 2  Calibration
9. 2.1  Determine that the candidate resistivity reference
wafer   meets   the   resistivity   uniformity   requirements
appropriate  to  the  intended  application  or  applications
(see Sections 8.1, 8.4, and 8.5).
9. 2.2  Determine    the    resistivity    of    the    candidate
reference  wafer  at  its  center  in  accordance  with  SEMI
MF84  except  that  (1)  thickness  should  be  measured  in
accordance  with  Section  8.6.2,  (2)  each  determination
should  consist  of
m  measurements,  where  6  ≤ m ≤  10,
taken with the wafer rotated about (360/
m) deg between
each measurement, and (3) wafers with a surface finish
that  results  in  stable,  reproducible  measurements  may
be  used.    If  the  measurement  is  made  on  an  etched  or
polished surface, equivalence with the result that would
have  been  obtained  using  a  lapped  surface  must  be
demonstrated.
9. 2.3  Calculate   the   average   resistivity   corrected   to
23°C  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF84  and  the  sample
standard deviation of the six to ten individual resistivity
measurements (corrected to 23°C).
9. 2.4  If the resistivity reference wafer is to be used for
calibrating   a   mercury   probe   system,   convert   the
temperature-corrected  average  resistivity  value  to  net
carrier density using the computational method given in

determination, and
9. 2.5.12  Standard  deviation  of  corrected  center-point

,
9. 2.6.2  Diameter  of  the  area  over  which  thickness  and
radial  resistivity  uniformity  were  obtained,  if  different
from 38 mm,
9. 2.6.3  Measures of macro-scale and micro-scale radial
sheet  resistance  (resistivity)  uniformity,  including  the
method   or   methods   by   which   the   uniformity   was
determined,
9. 2.6.4  Measure     of     axial     resistivity     uniformity
estimate,  including  a  description  of  the  procedure  by
which the estimate was obtained, and
9. 2.6.5  Average   voltage-current   ratio,   corrected   to
23°C for a four-point probe with ideal (equal) 1.59-mm
probe-tip spacing.
10  Application of Resistivity Reference
Materials
10. 1  Calibration   procedures   for   various   resistivity
measurement  equipment  are  given  in  the  applicable
resistivity test method as summarized in Table 2.
10. 2  For  control  of  instruments  for  routine  resistivity
measurements,   a   control   chart   for   individuals   with
moving  range  should  be  employed.    In  general,  single
measurement determinations of resistivity are made for
routine   purposes;   therefore,   the   control   should   be
carried out on this basis.  Established procedures should
be  used  for  generating  and  maintaining  the  individuals
and  moving  range  control  charts,  for  determining  the
existence  of  out-of-control  conditions,  and  taking  the
appropriate corrective action.  A suggested procedure is
given  in  Section  R1-4  for  use  in  organizations  without
previously established procedures.
11  Operator Training Requirements
11. 1  Personnel responsible for selection and calibration
of  resistivity  reference  wafers  should  be  skilled  in  the
following areas:
11. 1.1  Operation    of    four-point    probe    resistivity
measurement   apparatus,   including   familiarity   with
SEMI MF84 or DIN 50431,
11. 1.2  Sources  of  radial  and  longitudinal  resistivity
variations in silicon crystal,

11. 2  Individuals     responsible     for     preparation     of
resistivity   reference   wafers   should   have   a   good
understanding  of  wafer  shaping  processes,  especially
slicing and lapping.
11. 3  Operators and other personnel associated with the
use  of  resistivity  reference  wafers  for  calibration  or
control  of  resistivity  measurement  equipment  used  in
production  or  for  other  routine  measurements,  should
be  well  trained  in  the  use  and  maintenance  of  the
equipment  as  well  as  in  meticulous  record  keeping;
accurate  records  are  essential  to  the  integrity  of  the
calibration  and  control  procedures.    Familiarity  with
statistical     process     control     procedures     including
generation  and  maintenance  of  moving  range  control
charts, recognition of out-of-control conditions, and the
appropriate corrective action chain is also required.

RELATED INFORMATION 1
PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINING THE PRESENCE OF OUT-OF-
CONTROL CONDITIONS AND THE NEED FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION
NOTICE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  MF1527.    It  was  derived  from
information  developed  during  the  original  preparation  of  the  standard  in  ASTM  Committee  F-1  in  1994.
This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures.
R1-1   Types of Control Charts
R1-1.1   Three types of control charts are employed for
various   purposes   in   connection   with   the   use   of
resistivity reference wafers.
R1-1.2   Two
X and s charts are used for the control of
primary resistivity measuring instruments.  One of these
is the usual type of chart for which the control limits are
established    from    measurements    made    with    the
instrument (see Section 7.1.1).  The second, intended to
ensure  traceability,  differs  from  the  usual  control  chart
in   that   it   has   limits   that   are   based   not   on   the
measurements     themselves     but     instead     on     the
characteristics of the CRMs used for the measurements
(see  Section  7.1.2).    These  two  types  of  control  charts
are  of  the  types  intended  to  provide  control  with  no
standard  given  and  control  with  respect  to  a  given
standard, respectively.
10

R1-1.3   The   third   type   of   chart   is   one   based   on
individual  measurements  and  the  moving  range,  which
is  the  difference  between  one  measurement  and  the
next.    The  control  limits  for  this  chart  are  based  on  the
measurements.  This type of chart is used for control of
instruments  for  routine  resistivity  measurements  (see
Section 10.2).
R1-2   Control Charts for Primary Resistivity
Measuring Instruments
R1-2.1    Since  there  is  no  standard  given  for  these
charts,  the  limits  are  based  on  the  initial  series  of
resistivity  determinations.    First,  select  an  appropriate
number  of  measurements  (six  to  ten)  for  the  resistivity
determination,    and    make    the    same    number    of
measurements    for    each    determination.        Begin
construction  of  the  instrument
X  and  s  charts  by
making  25  to  30  center-point  resistivity  determinations
in  accordance  with  the  procedure  of  Section  7.1.1  on
one  or  more  resistivity  reference  wafers  covering  the
resistivity range of the specimens to be measured.  If no
other  acceptable  material  is  available,  CRMs  or  other
commercially    obtained    calibrated    wafers    can    be
employed  until  suitable  reference  wafers  have  been

prepared.    Measurements  should  be  taken  regularly,
every  day  or  every  shift,  as  appropriate.    If  variations
between operators are suspected, separate control charts
should be maintained by different operators.

R1-4   Control Charts for Instruments for
Routine Resistivity Measurements
R1-4.1   For control of resistivity measuring equipment
used   in   routine   applications,   a   control   chart   for
individuals  with  moving  range  is  appropriate.    Select
reference  wafers  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  in
the  applicable  test  method  (see  Table  2)  covering  the
resistivity  range  of  the  specimens  to  be  measured.
Begin construction of the control chart by making 25 to
30    center-point    resistivity    determinations    on    the
selected   reference   wafer   in   accordance   with   the
procedures   in   the   method   governing   the   type   of
instrument being controlled.

Record  the  date,  time,  sample  identification,

after the first, calculate and record the magnitude of the
difference  between  the  current  value  and  the  previous
value.
R1-4.3
Construct  an X  (individuals)  chart  by  plotting
the measured resistivity values in the order in which the
data were obtained.  Construct a moving R (range) chart
by  plotting  the  differences  in  the  order  in  which  they
were obtained.

R2-4    Temperature  Correction  Factor—SEMI  MF84
requires   that   the   resistivity   of   a   silicon   wafer   be
corrected to its value at 23°C.  Between 18° and 28°C,
the  resistivity  of  silicon  can  be  treated  as  a  linear
function   of   the   temperature;   over   this   temperature
range,  the  temperature  correction  factor,  F
T
is  given  as
follows:

R2-4.1    The  temperature  coefficient  has  been  deter-
mined experimentally as a function of the resistivity of
both   boron-   and   phosphorus-doped   silicon.

TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING BORON CONTAMINATION IN
HEAVILY DOPED n-TYPE SILICON SUBSTRATES BY SECONDARY
ION MASS SPECTROMETRY
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  for  publication  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  16,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org

September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.    Original  edition  published  by  ASTM  International  as
ASTM F 1528-94.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1528-94 (Reapproved 1999).
1  Purpose
1. 1  Frequently  it  is  essential  to  control  the  boron  level
in   heavily-doped   n-type   substrates   used   to   make
epitaxial  wafers  because  the  boron  contamination  can
result  in  autodoping  at  the  epitaxial  silicon-substrate
interface.
1. 2  SIMS  can  measure  the  boron  contamination  in
heavily-doped n-type substrates.
1. 3  This  test  method  can  be  used  for  process  control,
research  and  development,  and  materials  acceptance
purposes.
2  Scope
2. 1  This  test  method  covers  the  determination  of  total
trace boron contamination in the bulk of single crystal,
heavily doped n-type silicon substrates using secondary
ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).
2. 2  This  test  method  can  be  used  for  silicon  in  which
the  dopant  concentrations  are  less  than  0.2%  (1  ×  10
20

atoms/cm
3
)    for    antimony,    arsenic    or    phosphorus
doping.    This  test  method  is  especially  applicable  for
silicon    where    boron    is    an    unintentional    p-type
contaminant at trace levels (<5 × 10
14
atoms/cm
3
).
2. 3  This  test  method  can  be  used  for  silicon  in  which
the  boron  contamination  is  greater  than  two  times  the
SIMS  detection  limits  that  is  approximately  between  5
×  10
12
atoms/cm
3
and  5  ×  10
13
atoms/cm
3
depending
upon the instrumentation type.
2. 4  In principle, different sample surfaces can be used,
but  the  precision  estimate  was  taken  from  data  on
polished etched surfaces.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  Boron  adsorbed  on  the  surface  can  interfere  with
the boron measurement.
3. 2  Boron    adsorbed    from    the    SIMS    instrument
chamber  to  the  surface  can  interfere  with  the  boron
measurement.
3. 3  The specimen surface must be flat in the specimen
holder windows so that the inclination of the specimen
surface  with  respect  to  the  ion  collection  optics  is
constant  from  specimen-to-specimen.    Otherwise,  the
accuracy and precision can be degraded.
3. 4  The  accuracy  and  precision  of  the  measurement
degrade  significantly  as  the  roughness  of  the  specimen
surface  increases.    This  degradation  can  be  avoided  by
using polished etched surfaces.
3. 5  Variability of boron in the calibration standards can
limit the measurement precision.
3. 6  Bias  in  the  assigned  boron  concentration  of  the
calibration  standard  can  introduce  bias  into  the  SIMS
measured boron.

5. 1  Definitions
5. 1.1  ion  mass  spectrometry  —  the  separation  and
counting of ions by their mass-to-charge ratio.
5. 1.2  primary  ions  —  ions  created  and  focused  by  an
ion  gun  onto  the  specimen  surface  to  sputter  ionize
surface atoms.
5. 1.3  secondary   ion   mass   spectrometry   —    mass
spectrometry  performed  upon  secondary  ions  from  the
specimen surface.
5. 1.4  secondary  ions  —  ions  that  leave  the  specimen
surface  as  a  result  of  the  primary  ion  beam  sputter
ionizing the specimen surface atoms.
5. 2  For definitions of other terms used in silicon wafer
technology refer to SEMI M1 and SEMI MF1241.
6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1  Secondary   ion   mass   spectrometry   (SIMS)   is
utilized to determine the bulk contamination of boron in
single crystal, heavily doped  n-type silicon substrates.
6. 1.1  Specimens  of  single  crystal  silicon  (one  silicon
specimen with very low boron concentration, such as a
high resistivity n-type float-zone silicon specimen, to be
used   as   an   instrumental   BLANK;   one   calibration
specimen  made  of  a  bulk-doped  boron  silicon  wafer;
and the test specimens) are loaded into a sample holder.
6. 1.2  An oxygen primary ion beam is used to bombard
each specimen.
6. 1.3  The positive secondary ions are mass analyzed.
6. 1.4  The   BLANK   silicon   sample   is   sputtered   to
determine instrumental background.
6. 1.5  The  samples  are  then  analyzed  for  boron  and
silicon in a sequential manner throughout the holder.
6. 1.6  The  ratio  of  the  measured  boron  and  silicon
secondary  ion  intensities  (B
+
/S
+
)  is  calculated  for  each
specimen.
6. 1.7  The (B
+
/Si
+
) ratios of the test specimens are then
converted  to  boron  concentrations  by  linear  scaling
from  the  (B
+
/Si
+
)  ratio  of  the  calibration  specimen  that
has a known boron concentration.
6. 1.8  No crater measurement is required.
7  Apparatus
7. 1  Magnetic  Sector  SIMS  Instrument,  equipped  with
an   oxygen   primary   ion   source,   electron   multiplier
detector,  and  Faraday  cup  detector  or  daley  detector
capable  of  measuring  positive  secondary  ions.    The
SIMS  instrument  should  be  adequately  prepared  (that
is,   baked)   so   as   to   provide   the   lowest   possible
instrumental background.
7. 2  Liquid    Nitrogen    or    Liquid    Helium    Cooled
Cryopanel,  to  surround  the  test  specimen  holder  in  the
analysis  chamber  if  the  analysis  chamber  vacuum  is
10
−8
torr  or  higher.    For  instruments  with  vacuum  less
than 10
−8
torr the cooling is not required.
7. 3  Test  Specimen  Holder,  to  keep  the  specimen(s)
analysis surface planar and perpendicular to the several
kV extraction field, depending on the instrument type.
8  Sampling
8. 1  Since  this  procedure  is  destructive  in  nature,  a
sampling   procedure   must   be   used   to   evaluate   the
characteristics of a group of silicon wafers.
8. 1.1  No  general  sampling  procedure  is  included  as
part  of  this  test  method,  because  the  most  suitable
sampling   plan   varies   considerably   depending   upon
individual  conditions.    See  ASTM  Practice  E  122  for
suggested choices of sampling plans.
8. 1.2  For  referee  purposes,  a  sampling  plan  shall  be
agreed  upon  between  the  parties  to  the  test  before
conducting the test.
9  Specimen Requirements
9. 1  Sample  specimens  must  be  flat  and  smooth  on  the
side  used  for  analysis.    The  surface  shall  have  a  polish
etch   surface   or   better   (that   is,   chem-mechanically
polished).
9. 2  Sample  specimens  must  be  cleaved  or  diced  to  fit
within the sample specimen holder.
9. 3  A bulk boron-doped silicon calibration specimen is
required.
9. 4  A     BLANK     silicon     specimen     with     boron
concentration   below   5   ×   10
12
atoms/cm
3
must   be
present.
10  Calibration
10. 1  The  calibration  standard  must  be  present  with
bulk  boron  concentration  between  1  and  10  ×  10
14

atoms/cm
3
as  determined  by  some  other  measurement

11  Procedure
11. 1  Specimen Loading
11. 1.1  Load   the   specimens   into   the   SIMS   sample
holder  checking  to  see  that  the  specimens  are  flat
against   the   backs   of   the   windows   and   cover   the
windows  as  much  as  is  possible.    A  specimen  load
includes: one BLANK silicon specimen, one calibration
specimen, and the test specimens.
11. 2  Instrument Tuning
11. 2.1  Turn  on  the  instrument  in  accordance  with  the
manufacturer's instructions.
11. 2.2  Fill  the  liquid  nitrogen  or  helium  cold  trap  if
cooling equipment is used as stated in Section 7.2.
11. 2.3  Analytical Conditions
11. 2.3.1  Use a focused oxygen primary-ion current and
adjust  the  contrast  diaphragm  and  field  aperture  to
maximize  the
30
Si
+
-ion  count  rate.    The  rate  must  be
greater  than  1  ×  10
8
counts/s  as  measured  on  the
Faraday cup or daley detector, and with no raster.
11. 2.3.2  Use  a  first  raster  test  condition  of  several
hundred  micrometers  by  several  hundred  micrometers,
depending  upon  the  beam  radius,  (typical  condition  is
250-μm  by  250-μm  raster)  to  remove  surface  boron  in
the  native  oxide.    For  the  actual  measurement,  use  a
second raster test condition reduced several times from
the first raster condition (typical second raster condition
is 50-μm by 50-μm).  Use integration times of 1 s.
11. 3  Analysis of Specimen
11. 3.1  Position   the   specimen   holder   such   that   the
sputtered  crater  in  the  specimen  forms  near  the  center
of the window.
11. 3.2  Center the primary ion beam and begin a SIMS
profile.
11. 3.2.1  Sputter   the   sample   using   the   first   raster
condition  for  50  to  100  cycles  of  the  magnet  until  the
boron intensity is stable to remove any residual surface
contamination found typically in the native oxide of all
wafers.
11. 3.2.2  Decrease the rastered area to the second raster
condition and continue sputtering until the boron signal
is stable.
11. 3.3  At the end of the profile, measure and record the
11
B
+
count  rate  on  the  electron  multiplier  detector  and
the
30
Si
+
matrix intensity on the Faraday cup detector or
daley detector, averaged over the last 15 cycles.
11. 3.4  Repeat  the  above  steps  for  all  the  specimens  in
the holder until all the specimens have been sputtered.
11. 3.5  Calculate the ratio (
11
B
+
/Si
+
) of boron count rate
to  silicon  intensity  using  the  recorded  secondary  ion
intensities  at  the  end  of  each  profile.    Record  each
calculated ratio as S
u
.
11. 3.6  If the measured ratio (
11
B
+
/Si
+
) for the BLANK
specimen  exceeds  20  to  50%  of  the  ratio  (
11
B
+
/Si
+
)  of
the  other  specimens,  abort  the  analysis  and  find  the
cause of the high instrumental background.
11. 3.7  For   all   specimens   including   the   BLANK,
calibration,  and  test  specimens,  record  the  specimen
identification, and the (
11
B
+
/Si
+
) ratios, in a table.
12  Calculations
12. 1  Relative Sensitivity Factor (RSF) Calibration
12. 1.1  Calculate  the  relative  sensitivity  factor  RSF  as
follows:

=  ion  intensity  on  the  Faraday  cup,  daley  detector
or  other  detector  capable  of  measuring  positive
secondary  ion  currents  above  the  rate  of  10

counts/s.
12. 1.2  Convert  the  SIMS  ion  count  (

TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION
BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION
PROCEDURE
This  test  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the North American Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org

September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.    Original  edition  published  by  ASTM  International  as
ASTM F 1529-94.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1529-02.
1  Purpose
1. 1 The    sheet    resistance    of    epitaxial,    implanted,
diffused  or  deposited  films  is  an  important  materials
acceptance   and   process   control   parameter.      The
uniformity   across   a   wafer   of   the   sheet   resistance
resulting  from  any  of  these  processes  is  important  for
the  equivalence  of  performance  of  devices  or  circuits
made from various regions of the wafer.
1. 2 This   test   method   uses   a   four-point   probe   in   a
manner different from that of other ASTM methods for
the measurement of the resistivity or sheet resistance of
semiconductors.  In this test method, two different ways
(configurations)  of  connecting  the  probe  pins  to  the
electronics that supply current and measure voltage are
used  at  each  measurement  location  on  the  specimen.
This  use  of  a  four-point  probe  is  often  referred  to  as
“dual-configuration”   or   as   “configuration   switched”
measurements.
1. 3 There are three benefits that result from the second
measurement  configuration  at  each  location:  (1)  the
probe   no   longer   needs   to   be   in   a   high   symmetry
orientation on the specimen, that is, being perpendicular
or  parallel  to  the  radius  on  a  circular  wafer  or  to  the
length or width of a rectangular specimen, as long as it
is a modest distance from the edge of the wafer, (2) the
lateral  dimension(s)  of  the  specimen,  and  the  exact
location of the probe on the specimen no longer have to
be known—the geometric scaling factor results directly
from  the  two  sets  of  electrical  measurements  at  each
location,  (3)  the  two  sets  of  measurements  self-correct
for  the  actual  separations  between  the  probe  pins  in  a
manner  that  has  been  shown  to  be  more  effective  than
measuring   probe   impressions   made   on   a   piece   of
polished   material.      As   a   result,   high   precision
measurements    can    be    made    with    smaller    probe
separations  than  is  possible  with  single  configuration
use  of  a  four-point  probe,  thus  allowing  higher  spatial
resolution of wafer sheet resistance variations.

Measuring Large Diameter Doped Semiconductor Wafers,” J.
Electrochem. Soc. 123, 1745–1750 (1976).
1. 4 This test method is intended primarily for assessing
the  uniformity  of  layers  formed  by  diffusion,  epitaxy,
ion  implant  and  chemical  vapor,  or  other  deposition
processes  on  a  silicon  substrate.    The  deposited  film,
which    may    be    single    crystal,    polycrystalline    or
amorphous silicon, or a metal film, must be electrically
isolated  from  the  substrate.    This  can  be  accomplished
if  the  layer  is  of  opposite  conductivity  type  from  the
substrate  or  is  deposited  over  a  dielectric  layer  such  as
silicon   dioxide.      This   test   method   is   capable   of
measuring films as thin as 0.05 μm, but particular care
is  required  for  establishing  reliable  measurements  for
most films in the range below 0.2 μm.  Films that have
a  thickness  up  to  half  the  probe  separation  can  be
measured   without   the   use   of   a   thickness-related
correction  factor.    It  may  give  misleading  results  for
films   formed   by   silicon   on   insulator   technologies
because of charge or charge trapping in the insulator.
1. 5 This  test  method  can  be  used  to  measure  the  sheet
resistance  uniformity  of  bulk  substrates.    However,  the
thickness of the substrate must be known to be constant
or   must   be   measured   at   all   positions   where   sheet
resistance  values  are  measured  in  order  to  calculate
relative variations in resistance reliably.
NOTE 1:  The  thickness  correction  factor  for  layers  that  are
thicker  than  0.5  times  the  probe  spacing  is  known  to  vary
more  rapidly  than  that  for  single-configuration  four-probe
measurements,   but   such   a   correction   has   not   yet   been
published.    Until  such  a  correction  is  published,  resistivity
values  determined  by  the  dual-configuration  method  will  not
be accurate for these thicker specimens; however, if the wafer
has  uniform  thickness,  variations  of  resistivity  can  still  be
determined by this test method.
1. 6 This  test  method  is  suitable  for  use  in  materials
acceptance,  equipment  qualification,  process  control,
research, and development.
2  Scope
2. 1 This  test  method  covers  the  direct  measurement  of
the  sheet  resistance  and  its  variation  for  all  but  the
periphery  (amounting  to  three  probe  separations)  for
circular    conducting    layers    pertinent    to    silicon
semiconductor   technology.      These   layers   may   be


SEMI MF1529-1104 © SEMI 2004 2
fabricated on substrates of any diameter that is capable
of being securely mounted on a prober stage.
NOTE 2:  The  equation  used  to  calculate  the  sheet  resistance
data  from  measurements  is  not  perfectly  accurate  out  to  the
edge  of  the  wafer  for  probes  oriented  at  an  arbitrary  angle
with respect to a wafer radius.  Further, automatic instruments
on  which  this  test  method  will  be  performed  may  not  have
perfect  centering  of  the  wafer  on  the  measurement  stage.
These  factors  require  that  the  periphery  of  the  layer  being
measured  be  excluded.    Also,  many  thin  film  processes  use
wafer  clamps  that  preclude  forming  layers  out  to  the  edge  of
the  substrate.    The  edge  exclusion  in  this  test  method  applies
to the film that is being measured, rather than to the substrate.
The  equation  used  is  based  on  mathematics  developed  for
layers of circular shape.  It is expected to work well for layers
of   other   shapes   such   as   rectangular,   if   edge   exclusion
requirements are met; however, the accuracy near the edge of
other shapes has not been demonstrated.

2. 2 This  test  method  can  be  used  to  measure  sheet
resistance values from below 10 mΩ for metal films, to
over  25  000  Ω  for  thin  silicon  films.    However,  for
films  at  the  upper  end  of  this  resistance  range,  and  for
films  toward  the  low  end  of  the  thickness  range,  the
interpretation of the sheet resistance values may not be
straightforward     due     to     various     semiconductor
effects.
3,4,5

NOTE 3:  The   principles   of   this   test   method   are   also
applicable    to    other    semiconductor    materials,    but    the
appropriate  conditions  and  the  expected  precision  have  not
been established.
2. 3 This   test   method   uses   two   different   electrical
configurations    of    the    four-point    probe    at    each
measurement location.  It does not require measurement
of probe location on the wafer, or probe separations, or
of  wafer  diameter  (except  to  determine  edge  exclusion
for  measurement-site  selection)  as  do  other  four-point
probe  methods  such  as  Test  Methods  SEMI  MF81,
SEMI  MF84  and  SEMI  MF374.    By  use  of  electrical
data   from   the   two   different   configurations   at   each
location,  the  method  is  self-calibrating  with  respect  to
the geometrical parameters.

automated wafer testing systems that use R-theta or X-

calculations for sheet resistance used in this test method
are   based   on   more   extensive   calculations,   and   are
within  0.1%  of  the  results  of  those  more  extensive
calculations, even if the probes are not oriented parallel
or  perpendicular  to  a  wafer  radius,  providing  that  the
probes are more than 3-probe spacings from the edge of
the layer being measured

(see Note 1).
2. 5 Use   of   two   electrical   configurations   at   each
measurement  site  eliminates  the  need  for  measurement
of  geometric  separation  of  the  probe  tips  in  order  to
analyze   the   data.      As   a   result,   even   for   referee
measurements,  any  probe  spacing  that  is  agreed  upon
between   the   parties   to   the   test   and   demonstrates
sufficiently  low  data  scatter  may  be  used  for  this  test
method.
2. 6 The  values  stated  in  SI  units  are  to  be  regarded  as
the  standard.    The  values  given  in  parentheses  are  for
information only.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1 Photoconductive    and    photovoltaic    effects    can
seriously   influence   the   measured   sheet   resistance,
particularly  with  high  resistivity  layers  or  those  with
very  shallow  junctions.    Therefore,  all  measurements
should   be   made   in   a   darkened   enclosure   unless
experience   shows   that   the   material   of   interest   is
insensitive to ambient illumination.
3. 2 Spurious  currents  can  be  induced  in  the  test  circuit
when  the  equipment  is  located  near  high-frequency
generators.  If such a location is unavoidable, adequate
shielding must be provided.
3. 3 Minority  carrier  injection  during  the  measurement
can  occur  due  to  the  electric  field  in  the  specimen.
With   material   possessing   a   long   minority-carrier
lifetime and moderate to high resistivity, such injection
can   result   in   a   lowering   of   the   resistivity   (sheet
resistance)  for  a  distance  of  several  centimeters  from
the point of injection.  Carrier injection can be detected
by repeating the measurements at lower current.  In the
absence of injection, no increase in resistivity should be
observed   at   the   lower   current.      The   current   level
recommended,    (see    Table    1)    should    reduce    the
probability  of  difficulty  from  this  interference  to  a
minimum,  but  in  cases  of  doubt  the  measurements
should  be  repeated  at  a  lower  current  level.    If  the
proper  current  is  being  used,  doubling  or  halving  its


SEMI MF1529-1104 © SEMI 2004 3
value  should  result  in  a  change  of  sheet  resistance  that
is less than 0.5%.
Table 1  Nominal Current Values for Measurement of
Sheet Resistance
#1
The  current  used  should  be  from  one-half  to  twice  the  nominal
value  and  should  be  chosen  to  give  a  measured  voltage  on  the
specimen  that  is  between  7  and  15  mV  when  using  Configuration  A.
Once  the  current  is  selected  for  forward  direction  measurements  at  a
given  site,  it  must  be  kept  constant  to  0.01%  for  the  remaining
measurements at that site.

3. 4 Semiconductors   have   a   significant   temperature
coefficient     of     resistivity.          Consequently,     the
measurement  current  used  should  be  small  to  avoid
resistive  heating.    The  current  levels  recommended
should reduce the chances of this problem.  If resistive
heating  is  suspected,  it  can  be  detected  by  a  change  in
readings   starting   immediately   after   the   current   is
applied.    If  such  a  change  is  observed,  repeat  the
electrical  measurements  at  a  lower  current.    In  the
absence  of  Joule  heating,  the  temperature  of  the  water
should  be  uniform  if  the  wafer  is  mounted  on  a  chuck
having  good  thermal  conductivity  and  large  thermal
mass.  Sheet resistance maps should not be distorted by
temperature non-uniformities in this case.  Coefficients
for the temperature variation of the sheet resistance of a
particular  layer  type  will  depend  upon  the  specific
dopant,  or  resistivity,  profile  of  that  layer  type,  and
must  be  evaluated  empirically  for  the  layer  fabrication
process  being  used  if  correction  of  data  to  a  fixed
reference temperature is desired.
3. 5 Vibration  of  the  probe  may  cause  variations  in
contact   resistance,   which   is   often   manifested   as
unstable  readings.    If  difficulty  is  encountered,  the
apparatus should be vibration isolated.
3. 6 Penetration  of  either  the  current  or  voltage  probes
through   the   layer   being   measured   to   the   substrate
results  in  erroneous  readings.    This  can  usually  be
checked  by  mounting  the  specimen  directly  on  a  metal
support  that  is  grounded  to  the  current  supply  and  by
then  looking  for  a  reduction  in  measured  specimen
voltage in at least one polarity as the ground connection
is  removed  and  replaced.    If  this  condition  occurs,
examine   the   probe   tips   microscopically   for   sharp
asperities  and  remove  these  by  polishing  or  otherwise
conditioning  the  probe  tip,  or  else  reduce  the  probe
force or use a probe with blunter probe tips.
3. 7 Use    of    the    data    from    the    two    electrical
configurations  to  calculate  a  factor  for  water  diameter
and for position of the measurement site on the wafer is
accurate to within 0.1% as long as the measurement site
is  away  from  the  perimeter  of  the  wafer.    To  meet  this
requirement   the   site   should   be   at   least   five-probe
separations  from  the  perimeter  for  the  case  of  probe
alignment  perpendicular  to  a  wafer  diameter,  and  at
least three-probe separations from the perimeter for the
case  of  probe  alignment  parallel  to  a  wafer  diameter.
For certain processes, such as ion implantation, use of a
wafer clamp during layer formation causes a p-n layer-
to-substrate  junction  on  the  top  surface  of  the  wafer
interior  to  the  mechanical  edge  of  the  wafer.    In  these
cases,  the  probe  separation  values  above  refer  to  the
location  of  the  measurement  site  with  respect  to  such
junctions.
3. 8 In shallow or lightly-doped layers, an effect known
as  carrier  redistribution  causes  the  number  of  free
carriers  in  the  layer  to  be  different  from  the  number  of
dopant  atoms.    As  a  result,  sheet  resistance  values
measured   by   this   test   method   may   be   noticeably
different from values calculated from models that imply
the   dopant   and   free-carrier   depth   profiles   to   be
equivalent.
3. 9 Surface   and   near-surface   effects,   such   as   the
formation  of  hydrogen  complexes  with  acceptors,  may
occur  during  or  immediately  after  the  fabrication  of
many  thin  films,  particularly  if  lightly  doped.    They
may also occur slowly with storage.  These effects may
be  uniformly  or  non-uniformly  distributed  across  the
wafer  surface.    The  result  is  to  modify,  generally  by
way of increasing, the measured sheet resistance.  Two
of  the  most  prominent  impacts  of  these  effects  are  to
make  the  results  of  a  given  process  step  appear  to  be
more non-uniform than is actually the case, and to shift
the  absolute  level  of  a  reference  wafer  used  to  monitor
the performance of the mapping tool so as to make the
tool appear to be out of control.

6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1 An in-line four-point probe is used to determine the
specimen sheet resistance at each desired measurement
location.
6. 1.1 The   number   and   positioning   of   measurement
locations  is  determined  by  end-use  needs,  or  by  the
parties to the test in the case of referee measurements.
6. 1.2 At each location, a direct current is passed into the
specimen, using two of the probes, as specified, and the
potential  difference  is  measured  using  the  other  two
probes.
6. 1.3 Current   polarity   is   reversed   and   the   potential
difference   is   re-measured   to   allow   elimination   of
thermoelectric effects.
6. 1.4 Before the probe is raised, the process is repeated
using  a  different  combination  of  probes,  as  specified.
At  each  location,  the  sheet  resistance  is  obtained  from
the four ratios of potential difference to current.
6. 2 The  adequacy  of  the  probe  is  determined  both  by
optical  examination  of  probe  indentations  made  in  a
polished silicon surface, and by a performance test on a
wafer of the type whose uniformity is to be checked.
6. 3 The  accuracy  of  the  electronics  is  tested  by  means
of  an  analog  circuit  emphasizing  the  performance  and

.
noise  immunity  of  the  electronics  in  the  presence  of
large   contact   resistances   of   the   probe   tips   to   the
semiconductor surface.
7  Apparatus
7. 1 Specimen Preparation
7. 1.1 Chemical   Laboratory   Apparatus   —   Such   as
plastic  beakers,  graduated  cylinders,  and  plastic  coated
tweezers  for  use  both  with  acids  and  with  solvents.
Proper facilities for handling and disposing of acids and
their vapors are essential.
7. 1.2 Hot  Plate  —  Large  enough  to  heat  wafer  of
interest to 200°C.
7. 2 Probe Assembly
7. 2.1 Four-point Probe — Having conical probe tips of
a   durable   material   such   as   tungsten-carbide.      The
included angle of the tips shall be in the nominal range
45  to  150°.    The  probe  tips  shall  be  in  a  straight  line
with  nominally  equal  separations  in  the  range  250  μm
(0.010  in.)  to  1.59  mm  (0.0625  in.).    An  isolation
resistance  between  adjacent  probes,  a  factor  of  10
5

larger than the sheet resistance of the film is required; a
value  of  10
9
Ω,  or  greater,  is  recommended  for  the
widest general application.  Recommended tip radii and
probe force values are slightly different depending upon
whether   the   probe   force   is   applied   by   springs,   or
deadweight, as follows:
7. 2.1.1 Spring-loaded   Probes   —   Having   tips   that
terminate in a radius in the nominal range 25 to 250 μm
or  in  a  flat  circular  truncation  of  the  cone  with  a  circle
diameter in the range 50 to 125 μm.  A probe force per
pin  of  0.25  to  2.0  N  (approximately  25  to  200  gf)  may
be needed to cover the variety of films that are covered
under the scope of this test method.
7. 2.1.2 Deadweight-loaded   Probes   —   Having   probe
tips  that  terminate  in  a  radius  of  at  least  19  μm.    A
probe  force  per  pin  of  0.1  to  1  N  (approximately  10  to
100 gf) may be needed to cover the variety of films that
are covered under the scope of this test method.
NOTE 4:  In general, the blunter the probe tip, the higher the
probe force that is used to make good electrical contact to the
layer.  Conversely, the sharper the probe tip, or the thinner the
layer,  the  lighter  the  probe  force  that  should  be  used.    The
upper  end  of  the  allowed  probe  force  range  is  generally  used
only   for   buried-peak   conducting   layers,   such   as   MeV
implants,   or   for   high-resistivity,   thick   epitaxial   layers.
General   experience   indicates   that   there   is   not   a   simple
specification of one or two combinations of probe radius and
probe  force  that  will  cover  all  layers  of  interest.    Experience
with  conditioning  probe  tips  against  materials  such  as  a
sapphire or non-polished ceramic substrate, or even on a piece
of  lapped  silicon,  indicates  that  the  microroughness  of  the
probe  tip  is  a  very  important,  but  not-readily  specifiable


SEMI MF1529-1104 © SEMI 2004 5
parameter  for  the  proper  probe  type  in  a  given  application.
The  combination  of  probe  radius  and  force  that  is  chosen
affects   both   the   likelihood   of   probe   penetration   and   the
quality   of   electrical   contact,   which   in   turn   affects   the
measurement noise and accuracy.  A use test is given to aid in
verifying appropriateness of a given probe for a specific layer
type.  Controlled lowering of the probe pins so that contact is
made without lateral scrubbing of the probes against the wafer
surface has been found to be very important.
7. 3 Microscope
7. 3.1 The microscope for inspecting probe damage shall
have  a  magnification  of  at  least  600×,  and  an  eyepiece
magnification  no  greater  than  15×.    The  microscope
shall  be  capable  of  dark-field,  interference  contrast,  or
oblique illumination.
7. 3.2 The  microscope  shall  have  a  stage  capable  of
moving  the  specimen  in  order  to  examine  a  number  of
adjacent damage marks made by each of the four probe
points.
7. 4 Measurement Stage
7. 4.1 Wafer  Prober Stage  —  With  a  vacuum  chuck  or
comparable means of holding the wafer securely during
measurement.      This   vacuum   chuck   should   be   of
sufficient  thermal  mass  to  keep  the  wafer  at  a  constant
temperature,  within  1°C,  during  the  time  required  for
all  measurements.    The  stage  should  be  provided  with
stops,   pins,   engraved   circles,   or   other   means   for
accurately   and   repeatedly   positioning   wafers.      For
measurements   on   wafers   where   the   deposited   or
fabricated   film   may   extend   over   the   edges   of   the
substrate and make contact to the backside, a thin layer
of  mica,  or  other  electrical  insulator  must  be  used
between the wafer and the chuck.
7. 4.2 Probe Assembly Support that allows the probes to
be  lowered  onto  the  wafer  surface  with  no  evidence  of
lateral  movement  (probe  skidding).    This  requirement
can  be  verified  by  lowering  and  raising  the  probes  a
number  of  times  onto  a  polished  silicon  surface  with
steps of 50 to 100 μm between these locations, and then
observing  the  probe  damage  marks  for  each  of  the
probe points with the required microscope.
NOTE 5:  For  a  probe  with  blunt  tips  or  well-conditioned
probe  points,  it  is  generally  very  difficult  to  view  the  probe
damage   with   bright   field   illumination;   use   of   dark-field,
Nomarski, or oblique illumination is recommended.  To aid in
locating   the   probe   damage,   the   formation   of   a   grid   of
rectangles, by scribing, etching or other suitable process on a
polished   wafer   surface,   has   been   found   helpful.      The
rectangles  should  be  large  enough  to  allow  all  four  probe
points  to  be  readily  located  within  the  boundaries  and  a
number  of  probe  impressions  to  be  made  within  the  confines
of a single rectangle.
7. 4.3 Wafer  Probe  Stage  with  a  sufficient  range  of
motion  to  allow  probing  all  desired  locations  on  the
largest  wafers  to  be  measured.    Except  for  restrictions
on   the   exclusion   of   three   probe   spacings   at   the
perimeter  of  the  layer  being  measured,  the  accuracy  of
sheet resistance measurements using this test method do
not  require  any  particular  accuracy  on  the  position
coordinates.
NOTE 6:  If    this    test    method    is    used    for    referee
measurements,   uncertainty   in   position   coordinates   may
produce accurate measurements at the locations measured but
may   make   comparison   of   data   more   difficult.      It   is
recommended that the wafer be centered on the stage with an
accuracy  of  1  mm,  or  better,  and  that  all  positions  measured,
have  coordinates  controlled  with  an  accuracy  of  10  μm,  or
better, with respect to the center of the stage.
7. 4.4 The  wafer  stage  shall  be  instrumented  with  a
temperature  monitor  to  be  used  for  any  application
where  the  average  sheet  resistance  of  the  layer  is  a
parameter  to  be  reported.    The  temperature  monitor
may be of any convenient type, but must be accurate to
0. 3°C, or better.
7. 5 Electrical Measuring Apparatus
7. 5.1 The conceptual layout of the electronic circuitry is
shown in Figure 1 for the case where a standard resistor
is  used  to  monitor  the  applied  current.    The  standard
resistor  can  be  omitted  if  the  current  value  is  set  or
known directly.
7. 5.1.1 Constant    DC-Current    Source    —    Having
sufficient   compliance   voltage   to   supply   a   constant
current  that  results  in  a  measured  voltage  drop  on  the
specimen  that  is  between  5  and  20  mV.    Currents
between  10
−6
and  10
−2
A  are  required  if  the  sheet
resistance  range  1  to  20,000  Ω  is  to  be  covered.    The
output current must be stable to 0.01%, or better, during
the time required to take all data at each location; ripple
and other noise must be less than 0.1% of the dc-current
level.    A  compliance  voltage  in  excess  of  10  V  is
generally  not  needed  unless  measurements  must  be
made  through  a  significant  layer  of  oxide  or  other
dielectric.    A  standard  resistor  (Section  7.5.1.2)  is
needed  to  determine  measurement  current  unless  the
current  supply  is  in  calibration  and  known  to  output  a
dc-current that is within 0.1% or better of the set-point
value.  A wet or dry battery may be used for the current
source  providing  there  is  means  for  regulating  the
output current.

and a Probe Wired for Configuration A

NOTE 7:  to   semiconductor   effects   occurring   at   higher
measurement  currents  are  avoided.    However,  for  certain
applications  of  interest,  such  as  metal  films  and  very  heavily
doped  silicon  substrates,  it  will  generally  be  necessary  to
accept measurements with fewer significant figures or else to
use  a  current  supply  with  an  output  above  the  common
maximum  of  100  mA,  or  else  to  use  a  voltmeter  with  sub-
microvolt resolution.
7. 5.1.2 Standard Resistor — Used to monitor the value
of  the  measurement  current  if  the  current  supply  does
not  meet  the  accuracy  of  settability  given  in  Section
7. 5.1.1.  The standard resistor shall be selected to give a
potential  difference  of  0.5  to  5  times  that  measured
across the specimen.  This requires the standard resistor
to have a value from 2.5 to 25 times the sheet resistance
of the layer.  The value of the standard resistor must be
known at least to four significant digits.
7. 5.1.3 Switches —  Double  pole,  double  throw  switch
for reversing the direction of the current, and four pole,
double    throw    switch    for    changing    the    probe
configuration.      The   switching   functions   may   be
accomplished  by  wafer  switches  or  relays.    Isolation
between all switch poles or relays must be 10
6
times the
sheet  resistance  of  the  layer  being  measured;  isolation
of 10
9
Ω, or greater is recommended.
7. 5.1.4 Electronic  Voltmeter  —  To  read  the  potential
difference across the specimen and standard resistor, or
if  calibrated  in  conjunction  with  the  current  source,  to
read  the  voltage-current  ratio  directly.    The  voltmeter
shall  be  capable  of  measuring  dc  voltages  between  1
and  100  mV  full  scale,  and  be  able  to  resolve  the
measured voltages to 0.01%, or better.  The meter must
have an input impedance of at least 10
9
Ω.
7. 5.2 Analog Test Circuit — Five resistors connected as
shown  in  Figure  2  shall  be  used  according  to  the
measurement   electronics   qualification   procedure   of
Section  11.3  for  evaluating  the  accuracy  and  precision
of   the   electronics   in   the   presence   of   large   series
resistors   simulating   the   probe   contact   resistances.
Several  circuits  of  this  type  may  be  needed  with  the
resistance  of  the  central  resistor,  r,  of  each  being,
selected  according  to  the  expected  sheet  resistance  of
the layer to be measured, as listed in Table 2.

7. 6 Computer  Control  —  It  is  intended  that  this  test
method   will   be   under   control   of   a   computer   for
positioning   the   sample   at   each   of   the   intended
measurement sites, lowering the probes, and performing
all  necessary  control  of  circuit  switching,  setting  of
current values, and measuring and logging voltages.  It
is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  test  method  to  specify
details of the computer-based automation.

The resistance shall be within a range from one-half to twice the value listed

8  Reagents and Materials
8. 1 Purity of Reagents — All chemicals for which such
specifications  exist  shall  conform  to  the  assay  and
impurity  levels  of  Grade  1  SEMI  specifications  for
these  specific  chemicals.    Other  grades  may  be  used,
provided  it  is  first  determined  that  the  chemical  is  of
sufficiently   high   purity   to   permit   its   use   without
lessening the accuracy of the test.
8. 2 Purity  of  Water  —  Reference  to  water  shall  be
understood  to  mean  Type  E-3  or  better  deionized  (DI)
water as described in ASTM Guide D 5127.
8. 3 Qualification Wafers
8. 3.1 Polished  Silicon  Wafers  —  Of  any  convenient
diameter  for  making  probe  impressions to be inspected
for  general  probe  related  damage  and  contact  size  and
shape.  It is useful to divide the surface into rectangular
regions by use of scribe lines or similar technique to aid
in  locating  a  particular  series  of  impressions  under  the
inspection microscope.
8. 3.2 One,  or  more,  wafers  from  each  of  the  processes
to be evaluated, for testing the electrical suitability of a
given probe for the intended evaluation.
8. 4 Reagents   for   Surface   Treatment   —   If   surface
treatment  is  required,  the  following  chemicals  may  be
needed:
8. 4.1 Buffered    HF    —    10:1    or    more    dilute,    in
accordance with SEMI C23.
8. 4.2 2-Propanol — In accordance with SEMI C41.
8. 4.3 Acetone — In accordance with SEMI C19.
8. 4.4 Filtered dry nitrogen.
9  Sampling
9. 1 In the case of referee measurements, it is left to the
parties  to  the  test  to  agree  upon  the  number  of  wafers
from  a  batch,  and  their  selection  procedure,  as  well  as
the number and location of test positions on each wafer.
9. 2 In   the   case   of   non-referee   measurements,   for
example,  process  control  or  research  applications,  it  is
left  to  the  user  of  this  test  method  to  determine  the
number and location of test positions on each wafer.
10  Suitability of Test Specimen
10. 1 The  front  and  back  surfaces  of  the  wafer  to  be
measured  should  be  tested  for  conductivity  type  using
Method  A  of  SEMI  MF42.    If  they  are  of  the  same
conductivity  type,  a  thin  sheet  of  insulating  material,
such  as  mica,  should  be  placed  between  the  wafer  and
the  stage.    This  test  is  not  necessary  if  the  front  and
back surfaces are known to be of opposite conductivity
type  or  if  the  layer  is  fully  isolated  from  the  substrate
by a dielectric layer.
10. 2 If  the  wafer  to  be  measured  was  fabricated  by  a
process  that  uses  “finger”  clamps  or  other  types  of
clamping  that  intrude  into  the  top  surface  area  of  the
water,  the  wafer  is  unsuitable  for  use  with  sampling
plans  that  require  measurements  within  several  probe
spacings from the wafer perimeter.
11  Preparation of Apparatus
11. 1 Visual  Inspection  of  Probe  Impressions  —  This
inspection  should  be  performed  when  a  new,  rebuilt  or
reconditioned  probe  is  first  installed  to  get  an  initial
indication of the mechanical performance of the probes.
Once  a  probe  is  installed,  meets  the  visual  inspection
criteria,  and  is  left  mounted,  visual  inspection  of  probe
impressions  is  generally  not  needed;  functional  probe
performance  tests  detailed  in  Section  11.2  generally
suffice  to  qualify  the  probe  for  continued  use.    Further
visual   inspection   of   probe   impressions   is   advised,
however,   when   a   probe   has   trouble   meeting   the
requirements    of    Section    11.2.1.        More    routine
inspection   of   probe   impressions   is   also   advised   if
probes     are     interchanged     routinely     for     special
applications,  thus  increasing  the  risk  of  changes  in  the
alignment or rigidity of the probe mounting.
11. 1.1 After    selecting    a    probe    for    the    intended
application,   make   a   series   of   at   least   10   probe
impressions on a polished silicon surface in steps of 50
to   125   μm   (0.002   to   0.005   in.).      Examine   the
impressions  from  each  of  the  pins  to  determine  that
there  is  no  probe  skidding,  no  cracks  or  fracture  lines
surrounding   any   of   the   impressions,   and   that   the
impressions are generally compact in nature (see Figure
3).
11. 1.2 If  fracture  lines  are  seen,  the  probe  must  be
replaced,   or   conditioned   on   surfaces   of   ceramic,
sapphire,    lapped    silicon    or    other    suitable,    non-

contaminating material until sets of impressions can be
made that do not exhibit fracture.  After a conditioning
process,   it   is   useful   to   clean   the   probe   tips   with
methanol  on  a  cotton  swab  to  loosen  debris  that  may
have collected in the tip.
11. 1.3 If  probe  skidding  is  seen,  tighten  or  otherwise
adjust  the  probe  clamp  and  probe  lowering  mechanism
to eliminate skidding.
11. 1.4 If   non-compact   probe   impressions   are   seen,
acceptable  data  may  result,  but  the  probe  tip(s)  are
generally  in  an  advanced  state  of  wear  and  may  not  be
stable with use.
11. 2 Probe Performance Verification — This test must
be     performed     before     any     series     of     referee
measurements,  or  if  a  type  of  layer  is  being  measured
for which there is not past experience regarding proper
selection  of  probe  radius,  load  and  conditioning.    It
qualifies    a    probe    for    taking    highly    repeatable
measurements,   as   are   needed   for   mapping   spatial
variations   of   sheet   resistance,   but   does   not   ensure
accuracy  of  measured  value.    It  should  be  performed
separately for each type of layer to be measured.
11. 2.1 Select  a  wafer  of  the  type  to  be  checked  for
uniformity.      At   five   different   locations   that   are
reasonably  well  separated  on  the  wafer,  make  a  series
of   10   measurements   following   the   procedure   of
Sections  12.4  to  12.6,  13.1,  and  13.2,  using  steps  no
larger    than    100    μm    between    each    of    the    10
measurement  positions.    Calculate  the  average  and
standard   deviation   for   each   of   the   five   sets   of
measurements.  For a probe to be satisfactory for use in
measuring  layers  of  this  type,  the  standard  deviation
must  be  no  more  than  0.1%  of  the  average  for  at  least
four of these sets.
11. 3 Qualification  of  Measurement  Electronics  —  The
suitability and accuracy of the measurement electronics
shall   be   verified   immediately   prior   to   a   referee
measurement    unless    the    equipment    is    separately
demonstrated    to    be    under    statistical    control    for
measurements   of   that   process.      For   non-referee
applications,  use  of  the  analog  circuits  is  helpful  for
troubleshooting   or   performance   monitoring   of   the
electronics.
11. 3.1 Analog Test Circuit
11. 3.1.1 With   the   current   supply   short-circuited   or
turned off, attach the current leads from the analog test
circuit of the appropriate resistance value to the current
supply and connect the potential leads designated V (see
Figure  2)  from  the  analog  circuit  to  the  input  of  the
voltage  measuring  instrumentation.    Allow  sufficient
time for the electronics to warm up in accordance with
the manufacturers instructions.

All probe impressions were made with steps of about 50
μm between impressions, and using probes loaded more
heavily than would normally be done for measuring thin
films; this was done to provide better photographic detail.

NOTE 8:  Caution: Constant-current  power  supplies  often
operate  at  output  voltages  of  several  hundred  volts  when  not
connected   to   a   load.      Any   changes   of   connection   to   a
constant-current   supply   should   be   made   either   with   the
current supply turned off or with its output short-circuited.
11. 3.2 With  the  current  initially  in  either  direction  (to
be called “forward”) adjust its value to give a measured
voltage  of  between  7  and  12  mV  (see  Table  1  for
nominal  values).    Record  the  current,  I
f
,  through  the
analog  box,  or  measure  the  potential,  V
sf
,  across  the
appropriate  standard  resistor  connected  in  series  with
the  analog  box.    Measure  the  potential,  V
af
,  across  the
analog  box.    Reverse  the  direction  of  the  current  and
record  the  current,  I
r
,  or  measure  the  potential  V
sr
,
across  the  standard  resistor;  measure  the  potential,  V
ar
,
across  the  analog  box.    Repeat  this  procedure  until  ten
sets of data have been taken.  All values measured and
recorded  must  be  known  to  at  least  four  significant
figures.

11. 3.4 Requirements for the Analog Test Circuit — For
the   electrical   equipment   to   be   suitable   for   referee
measurements   at   the   sheet   resistance   value   just
simulated, it must meet the following requirements:
11. 3.4.1 The  value  of
m
r
v
must  be  within  0.25%  of  the
known value of the resistor, r, and
11. 3.4.2 The value of the standard deviation, s

must be
no greater than 0.1% of
m
r
v
.
NOTE 9:  If  not  previously  known,  the  value  of  the  analog
circuit  resistor  may  be  determined  by  using  the  procedure  of
Sections 11.3.1 to 11.3.3.2 but measuring the potential across
the analog box using the connections V′ in Figure 2.
12  Procedure
12. 1 Specimen Preparation
12. 1.1 If the specimens have been kept in a clean, non-
contaminating atmosphere, or are to be measured within
3 h after fabrication, proceed to Section 12.2.
12. 1.2 Remove possible organic contaminants that may
arise  from  the  storage  container  as  follows:  Rinse  the
specimen in acetone for 1 min.  Remove.  Immediately
immerse  in  2-propanol  for  1  min.    Remove.    Blow  dry
with  filtered  dry  nitrogen.    Repeat  if  necessary  until
specimen  is  free  from  visible  stains,  streaking  or  other
visual evidence of residue.
12. 2 Mounting and Checking the Wafer
12. 2.1 Using   vacuum   paddle,   tweezers,   or   robotic
arrangement,  mount  the  wafer  on  the  stage,  so  that  the
wafer center is within 1 mm of the stage center.  Clamp
the  wafer  to  the  stage  with  vacuum  or  other  means.
Lower   the   probes   onto   the   wafer.      If   not   known
measure  the  electrical  resistance  between  any  of  the
probe  pins  and  the  stage  to  verify  that  the  electrical
isolation is at least 10
9
Ω.
12. 2.2 Allow sufficient time for the wafer's temperature
to  equilibrate  with  that  of  the  stage.    Thirty  seconds  is
sufficient   if   the   wafer   had   been   held   at   room
temperature   prior   to   mounting.      Longer   times   are
necessary  if  the  wafer  was  recently  removed  from  a
reactor or other elevated temperature process.
NOTE 10:  The   absolute   value   of   the   wafer   temperature
during   measurement   affects   the   absolute   values   of   sheet
resistance,  particularly  for  lightly  doped  layers,  but  it  should
not  affect  the  measurement  of  uniformity  of  sheet  resistance
values,  as  long  as  the  temperature  is  constant  within  0.2°C
during  measurement  of  any  wafer.    However,  for  referee
measurements  or  process  control  applications,  for  which  the
absolute  sheet  resistance  values  are  likely  to  be  an  important
part of the measurement results, it is important to maintain the
stage temperature within a narrow range (e.g., 23 ± 1°C) or to
develop  an  empirical  relation  between  sheet  resistance  and
measurement  temperature  for  each  layer  fabrication  process
of interest.
12. 3 Measurement    Site    Selection    —    Using    the
measurement   site   selection   agreed   to   for   a   referee
measurement  or  that  decided  upon  for  process  control
or other application, follow Sections 12.4 through 12.6
at  each  measurement  site  before  raising  the  probe  and
moving to the next site.
NOTE 11:  Various   site   selection   plans   may   be   chosen
according to the application needs.  These include, but are not
limited  to:  diameter  scans  with  step  sizes  appropriate  to  the
spatial resolution needed, sparse sampling extensions of the 5-
point  and  9-point  plans  described  in  SEMI  MF81,  and  area
sampling plans with the size of the area and number of points
chosen    by    measurement    time    constraints    and    process
information  requirements,  such  as  the  circular  or  rectangular
patterns  of  SEMI  MF1618.    This  test  method  makes  no
recommendation  about  choice  of  sampling  plans,  since  user
needs and interests are widely varied.
NOTE 12:  If  wafer  diameter  scans  are  chosen,  the  probe
should  not  be  oriented  so  that  the  pins  lie  exactly  along  the


SEMI MF1529-1104 © SEMI 2004 10
diameter   being   scanned.      Doing   so   would   risk   noisy
measurements if probes were placed in previous measurement
locations.    This  may  be  avoided  by  slightly  misaligning  the
probe pins with respect to the diameter.
12. 4 Measuring  in  Configuration  A  to  Obtain  R
A
—
Connect the probe to the electronics  so  that  the  current
will flow through the outer pins (designated Pins 1 and
4),  and  that  the  specimen  voltage  will  be  measured  by
the  digital  voltmeter  (DVM)  using  the  inner  pins  (Pins
2  and  3),  Figure  4.    Lower  the  probe  into  the  wafer.
Start   with   the   current   in   either   direction   (called
“forward”), and adjust the current to obtain a specimen
voltage   between   7   and   12   mV,   inclusive.      It   is
recommended  that  the  current  value  be  increased  from
low  levels  until  the  required  voltage  is  obtained,  rather
than  lowering  the  current  from  large  values.    Measure
the  current  (using  the  proper  standard  resistor,  or  by
monitoring the set point of a calibrated current supply),
and  the  specimen  voltage,  each  to  a  resolution  of  at
least 0.01% of the value.  Record the current reading as
I
f(1-4)
,  and  the  voltage  reading  as  V
f(2-3)
.    Reverse  the
direction of the current and again measure the specimen
voltage and current to the same resolution.  Record the
current  readings  as  I
r(1-4)
and  the  voltage  reading  as
V
r(2-3)
.    The  subscripts  used  for  current  and  voltage  are
those  of  the  pins  that  perform  the  current-carrying  and
voltage-measuring functions (see Caution, Note 8).
12. 5 Measuring  in  Configuration  B  to  Obtain  R
B
—
Without  raising  the  probe  from  the  measurement  site,
connect  the  probe  to  the  current  supply  so  the  current
flows   through   one   of   the   outer   probes,   and   the
nonadjacent inner probe, Figure 5.  (There are two ways
of  doing  this  that  should  provide  equivalent  results.)
Connect  the  remaining  two  probes  to  the  voltmeter,
making sure that the wiring polarity corresponds to that
used for the connections to the current supply.  With the
current in the forward direction, measure and record the
current as I
f(1-3)
and the voltage as V
f(2-4)
), with the same
resolution  as  in  Section  12.4.    Reverse  the  direction  of
the  current;  measure  and  record  the  current  I
r(1-3)
and
the voltage as V
r(2-4)
.
NOTE 13:  The notation in Section 12.5 assumes Pins 1 and 3
were  used  for  current,  and  Pins  2  and  4  were  used  for
specimen voltage measurement.  If the other choice of wiring
the   probe   for   Configuration   B   were   used,   the   subscript
notation   in   Section   12.5   (and   Section   13.1.2)   would   be
changed accordingly.
12. 6 Moving to the Next Measurement Site
12. 6.1 Turn  off,  or  short  circuit,  the  output  of  the
current  supply;  raise  the  probe  and  move  the  stage  to
the  next  measurement  site.    Follow  the  procedure  of
Sections 12.4 and 12.5 at this and all other sites.

12. 6.2 The  current  at  each  measurement  site  may  be
kept  at  the  value  used  for  the  first  site,  or  it  may  be
readjusted  for  each  site  to  give  a  specimen  voltage
across the specimen sites that is within very tight limits.
Whenever  the  probes  are  lowered  or  the  current  is
changed, make sure that there is a short pause to ensure
that    the    probes,    the    current    supply,    and    the
measurement voltage lines have stabilized before taking
data.    Depending  on  the  wafer  type  and  the  design  of
the  instrumentation,  this  may  be  from  a  fraction  of  a
second to several seconds.
12. 6.3 Measure and record the temperature of the stage
to  the  nearest  0.1°C  at  least  at  the  beginning  and  the
end  of  the  measurements.    Actual  measurement  of
temperature  for  each  measurement  site  is  preferred  if
experience  indicates  that  noticeable  drift  or  fluctuation
(greater than 1°C) is likely to occur during the course of
the measurements.

13. 3 Reviewing   the   Data   —   Many   applications   of
uniformity testing involve acquisition of large amounts
of  data.    It  is  generally  beneficial  to  review  these  data
before  interpreting  them  simply  as  manifestations  of
sheet  resistance  non-uniformity.    A  useful  technique  is
to  plot  the  values  obtained  for  R
s
as  a  time  sequence,
that  is,  in  the  order  the  data  for  the  site  were  taken  for
these sites.  Examination of this plot may be correlated
with measurement site coordinates to reveal unexpected
edge proximity effects or regions of the wafer that have
unusual  non-uniformity  that  may  need  to  be  re-probed
with  a  different  site-selection  plan.    Examination  may
also   reveal   one   or   more   points   that   are   highly
inconsistent  with  adjacent  points,  possibly  indicating
problems   due   to   vibrations   or   spots   of   surface
contamination.    Note  such  observations,  but  do  not
delete or edit the data, unless agreed upon by all parties
to the test.
13. 4 Analysis   and   Summary   of   Data   —   The   sheet
resistance  data  may  be  analyzed  and  summarized  in  a
number  of  ways  as  agreed  upon  by  parties  to  referee
test,  or  as  appropriate  for  process  control  or  other
applications.  These may include, but are not limited to:
listing of all data with site coordinates, contour plots of
the  deviations  from  average  value,  and  distributional
statistics of the data.

15  Precision and Bias
15. 1 Precision —    Single    laboratory    values    for
repeatibility  of  the  measurement  of  wafer  uniformity
were  obtained  from  a  series  of  tests  run  in  1991.    For
these  tests,  five  types  of  wafers  with  average  sheet
resistance values from about 15 Ω to about 400 Ω were
tested, as detailed in Related Information 1.


SEMI MF1529-1104 © SEMI 2004 12
15. 1.1 The wafers in these tests were fabricated by five
different  processes.    The  purpose  of  these  tests  is  to
demonstrate  the  consistency  of  determination  of  sheet
resistance   uniformity   with   dual-configuration   four-
probe  measurements,  not  to  determine  the  uniformity
achievable  by  a  given  process.    The  five  processes
utilized are capable of both better and poorer uniformity
than seen here.
15. 1.2 The repeatability of uniformity values given here
represent    good    measurement    practice,    but    the
consistency  of  values  for  each  wafer  might  have  been
even  better  if  all  measurements  had  been  taken  over  a
shorter time interval.
15. 1.3 A  standard  deviation,  (in  percent),  was  used  to
represent  the  uniformity  values  obtained  for  each  test
on  each  of  the  wafers.    While  it  is  common  to  give
repeatability  values  as  a  standard  deviation,  in  order  to
avoid  confusion  from  duplication  of  terminology,  the
repeatability  of  the  repeated  determinations  of  non-
uniformity for each type wafer are given in Table R1-1
as the range of standard deviation values obtained in the
original tests.
15. 1.4 A straightforward propagation of errors based on
the performance specifications, in order to estimate the
precision,    does    not    appear    possible.        Required
instrument resolution, power supply stability, and probe
performance   qualification   are   designed   to   allow   a
relative  accuracy  and  precision  of  better  than  0.1%  for
all measurement sites on a wafer.  However, for wafers
with  high  uniformity  (for  example,  standard  deviation
of  all  measurement  site  values  on  the  order  of  0.2%),
even  these  requirements  may  not  ensure  good  two-
party,   or   multilaboratory   agreement   on   the   wafer
uniformity.
15. 2 Bias —  A  statement  of  bias  cannot  be  made
because  there  are  no  semiconductor  reference  artifacts
with a known level of non-uniformity.

RELATED INFORMATION 1
SINGLE LAB TEST RESULTS
NOTICE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  MF1529.    It  was  derived  from  information
developed  during  the  original  preparation  of  the  standard  in  ASTM  Committee  F-1  in  1994.    This  related
information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures on August 16, 2004.
R1-1  One  wafer  from  each  of  five  different  thin  film
types  was  tested  for  uniformity.    Each  was  100  mm
diameter.    A  measurement  test-site  plan  using  81  test
locations  located  at  wafer  center  and  on  four  equally
spaced  circles  with  a  maximum  radius  of  38.1  mm,  as
described    in    SEMI    MF1618,    was    used    for    all
measurements.        The    measure    of    uniformity    for
measurements on each wafer was the standard deviation
of the 81 measured values expressed as a percent of the
mean measured value.  For each of the wafers, 11 to 13
tests of uniformity were run over periods that ran from
3 to 6 months, depending on the individual wafer.
R1-1.1  Temperatures    of    the    wafer    stage    were
monitored  and  recorded.    Average  sheet  resistances
were  found  to  change  as  a  function  of  temperature  but
no corresponding corrections of sheet resistance values
were  made  because  the  temperature  coefficients  of
resistivity were not known for the films involved.  The
assumption   was   made   that   the   determination   of
uniformity should be minimally affected as long as the
temperature stayed relatively constant during the course
of each measurement run.
R1-1.2  Results  of  this  test  are  summarized  in  Table
R1-1.    The  highest  temperatures  used  for  each  wafer
were    achieved    by    deliberate    elevation    of    room
temperature  in  order  to  determine  whether  temperature
affected  average  sheet  resistance  or  uniformity  value.
Temperature  dependence  of  average  sheet  resistance
was seen for wafer Types 1, 2 and 5.  No dependence of
sheet resistance uniformity on temperature was seen.
R1-2  An  additional  test  involved  three  measurements
of uniformity on each of three different wafers from the
same  five  thin-film  fabrication  processes.    These  tests
were  completed  within  three  days.    They  were  also
associated    with    evaluation    of    the    repeatability
capability    of    the    sheet    resistance    measurement
instrumentation.    For  this  evaluation  of  the  instrument,
50  measurements  were  made  on  each  wafer  by  taking
10  very  closely  spaced  measurements  in  each  of  five
relatively widely separated locations on the wafer.  The
assumption  was  made  that  in  each  group  of  ten,  the
measurements  were  so  closely  spaced  compared  to  the
sampling   volume   of   the   four-point   probe   that   any
variability experienced was a measure of the equipment
repeatability   (imprecision)   and   was   not   caused   by
variations    in    the    thin    film    itself.        The    actual
measurements  of  wafer  uniformity  used  the  same  81-
point test pattern as used for the wafers in Section R1-1

R1-2.1  The  measurements  from  this  test,  summarized
in  Table  R1-2,  show  that  for  each  process,  the  three
wafers  have  a  different  average  sheet  resistance,  even
when  measured  at  the  same  nominal  temperature  and
they also have rather different levels of non-uniformity
as  determined  from  the  standard  deviations  of  the  81
measurements.      The   variation   of   these   run-to-run
standard deviations for a given wafer is seen to be small
compared    to    the    typical    wafer-to-wafer    standard
deviations for the different wafers from a given process.

SEMI MF1530-1104
TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING FLATNESS, THICKNESS, AND
TOTAL THICKNESS VARIATION ON SILICON WAFERS BY
AUTOMATED NON-CONTACT SCANNING
This  test  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee.  Current edition approved for publication by
the  North  American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  July  11,  2004.    Initially  available  at
www.semi.org
September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.    Original  edition  published  by  ASTM  International  as
ASTM F 1530-94.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1530-0704.
1  Purpose
1. 1  Flatness, thickness and thickness variation are vital
factors  affecting  the  yield  of  semiconductor  device
processing.
1. 2  Knowledge  of  these  characteristics  can  help  the
producer  and  consumer  determine  if  the  dimensional
characteristics   of   a   specimen   wafer   satisfy   given
geometrical requirements.
1. 3  This  test  method  is  suitable  for  measuring  the
flatness and thickness of wafers used in semiconductor
device   processing   in   the   as-sliced,   lapped,   etched,
polished, epitaxial or other layer condition.
2  Scope
2. 1  This    test    method    covers    a    noncontacting,
nondestructive  procedure  to  determine  the  thickness
and flatness of clean, dry, semiconductor wafers in such
a way that no physical reference is required.
2. 2  This  test  method  is  applicable  to  wafers  50  mm  or
larger    in    diameter,    and    100    μm    (0.004    in.)
approximately  and  larger  in  thickness,  independent  of
thickness  variation  and  surface  finish,  and  of  wafer
shape.
2. 3  This test method measures the flatness of the front
wafer  surface  as  it  would  appear  relative  to  a  specified
reference  plane  when  the  back  surface  of  the  water  is
ideally flat, as when pulled down onto an ideally clean,
flat  chuck.    It  does  not  measure  the  free-form  shape  of
the wafer.
2. 4  Because   no   chuck   is   used   as   a   measurement
reference,  this  test  method  is  relatively  insensitive  to
microscopic particles on the back surface of the wafer.
2. 5  The  values  stated  in  SI  units  are  to  be  regarded  as
the  standard.    The  values  given  in  parentheses  are  for
information only.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  Any relative motion between the probes and along
the  probe  measuring  axis  during  scanning  produces
error  in  the  lateral  position  equivalent-measurement
data.
3. 2  Most     equipment     systems     capable     of     this
measurement  have  a  definite  range  of  wafer  thickness
combined  with  sori/warp  (dynamic  range)  that  can  be
accommodated  without  readjustment.    If  the  sample
moves   outside   this   dynamic   range   during   either
calibration or measurement, results may be in error.  An
overrange  signal  can  be  used  to  alert  the  operator  and
measurement data examiners to this event.
3. 3  The  quantity  of  data  points  and  their  spacing  may
affect the measurement results (see Section 7.1.5.2).
3. 4  Site  flatness  measurements  may  be  affected  if  the
site  boundaries  and  corners  do  not  contain  data  array
elements.      This   effect   may   be   reduced   through
interpolation techniques.

revision  of  this  standard,  are  SFQR  with  a  site  size  of  either
26 mm by 8 mm or 25 mm by 8 mm and GBIR (TTV).
5. 2  Definitions  related  to  wafer  flatness  can  be  found
in SEMI M1.
5. 3  Definitions   of   other   terms   related   to   silicon
material technology can be found in SEMI MF1241.
6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1  A calibration procedure is performed.  This sets the
instrument's scale factor and other constants.
6. 2  The  wafer  is  supported  by  a  small-area  chuck  and
is scanned along a prescribed pattern by both members
of an opposed pair of probes.
6. 3  The   paired   displacement   values   are   used   to
construct  a  thickness  data  array  (t[x,y]).    This  array
represents the front surface of the wafer when the back
surface of the wafer is ideally flat, as when pulled down
onto and ideally clean, flat chuck.
6. 4  The  data  array  is  used  to  produce  one  or  more  of
the parameters required by the application.
6. 4.1  If flatness measurements are required, a reference
plane  and  a  focal  plane  suitable  to  the  application  are
constructed on the back or front surface.
6. 5  Thickness or flatness, or both, values are calculated
and reported, as required.

8  Materials
8. 1  Set-up    Masters    —    suitable    to    accomplish
calibration and standardization as recommended by the
equipment manufacturer.
8. 2  Reference  Wafer  —  with  total  thickness  variation
(TTV) value and flatness value similar to the product or
process to be monitored and with a data set that is used
to  determine  the  level  of  agreement  between  the  data
set obtained by the measuring equipment under test and
the reference wafer data set (see Section 9 ).
9  Suitability of Measuring Equipment
9. 1  Determine    the    suitability    of    the    measuring
equipment  with  the  use  of  a  reference  wafer  and  its
associated data set in accordance with the procedures of
Sub-section  9.2  ,  or  by  performance  of  a  statistically-
based    instrument    repeatability    study    to    ascertain
whether    the    equipment    is    operating    within    the
manufacturer's stated specification for repeatability.
9. 1.1  The reference wafer data set is a set of thickness
or flatness parameters based on corrected data in that all
possible  interferences  have  been  removed  and  the  data
has been replanarized in accordance with this method.
9. 1.2  Each reference wafer (artifact) is accompanied by
its own data set, the reference data set (RDS), in which
each  parameter  value  is  the  average  of  a  number  of
values  obtained  for  that  parameter  over  a  number  of
“passes”   (repeat   measurements).      The   artifact   is
measured  on  a  measurement  equipment  under  test  and
its  RDS  is  compared  against  the  resultant-measured
sample  data  set.    Delta-parameter  and  other  values  are
computed from the differences.  The parameter used to
determine   agreement   between   the   artifact   and   the
measuring  equipment  under  test  and  the  acceptable
level of this agreement is to be agreed upon between the
parties to the test.
9. 2  Procedure
9. 2.1  Select  a  reference  wafer  of  appropriate  criteria
together with its associated reference data set (RDS).
9. 2.2  Measure the reference wafer on the measurement
equipment under test to obtain a sample data set (SDS).
9. 2.3  Subtract the two data sets on a parameter basis to
obtain a difference data set (DDS):

DDSSDSRDS=−                          (1)
9. 2.3.1  The  DDS  represents  the  differences  between
the  measurements  made  on  the  measuring  equipment
under test and the reference data set.  The DDS contains
many values.
9. 2.4  The simplest metric that can be used to determine
acceptability    is    maximum    difference,    the    largest
absolute  value  in  the  DDS.    This  represents  the  worst-
case  disagreement  between  the  results  obtained  from
the    measurement    equipment    under    test    and    the
reference  data.    Accept  the  measurement  equipment  as
suitable for measurement if the maximum difference is
less than a value that is agreed upon between the parties
to the test.
SEMI MF1530-1104 © SEMI 2003, 2004 3


9. 2.5  More  complex  calculations  may  also  be  used  to
determine  acceptability.    For  example,  a  histogram  of
the  parameter  values  of  the  DDS  along  with  statistical
measures  (mean,  sample  standard  deviation,  etc.)  may
be   used.      These   measures   may   be   compared   to
application-specific  limits  or  used  to  provide  insight
into the nature and source of the difference, or both, as
arranged by agreement of the parties to the test.
10  Sampling
10. 1  This  test  method  is  nondestructive  and  may  be
used  on  either  100%  of  the  wafers  in  a  lot  or  on  a
sampling basis.
10. 1.1  If   samples   are   to   be   taken,   procedures   for
selecting the sample from each lot of wafers to be tested
shall  be  agreed  upon  between  the  parties  to  the  test,  as
shall the definition of what constitutes a lot.

12. 3.3.1.2  Three-point front surface plane (3), or
12. 3.3.1.3  Least-squares front surface plane (L).
12. 3.3.2  For  site  flatness  measurements  with  a  global
reference  plane,  select  one  of  the  following  global
reference  planes  using  all  points  within  the  FQA  to
construct the reference plane:
12. 3.3.2.1  Ideal back surface plane (I),
12. 3.3.2.2

sub-site  reference  plane,  select  the  following  reference
plane using all points within the sub-site that lie within
the FQA to construct the reference plane:

13. 3.2  Construct  a  focal  plane  to  calculate  deviation
parameters  from  the  data  set  t(x,y).    The  focal  plane  is
of the following form:

FFFfocal

The  focal  plane  is  parallel  with  the  reference  plane  so
that in all cases

13. 3.2.1  A   global   focal   plane   is   the   same   as   the
corresponding reference plane so that
• c

where x

are  the  coordinates  of  the  site  or  sub-

NOTE 2:  Use of the thickness data set, t(x,y), in this regard is
equivalent  to  setting  the  origin  of  the  z-axis,  as  defined  in
SEMI M20,  at the back surface of the wafer at each point of
the data set.  Then the value of z at each point is equal to the
thickness t at that point.  This is equivalent to constraining the
wafer so that the back surface is pulled down uniformly onto
an ideal chuck.
NOTE 3:  The  constants  a
R
and  a
F
provide  the  slopes  of  the
reference and focal planes, respectively, in the x direction, the
constants b
R
and  b
F
provide  the  slopes  of  the  reference  and
focal planes, respectively, in the y direction, and the constants
c
R
and  c
F
provide  the  distances  of  the  center  point  of  the
reference and focal planes, respectively, from the back surface
at that point.
NOTE 4:  The  values  t(x,y)  at  any  point  represent  z
f
(x,y),
where z
f
is  the  height  of  the  front  surface  from  the  z-axis
origin  at  each  point.    It  is  use  of  this  data  set  that  causes  the
reference  surface  to  be  the  front  surface  for  both  the  least
squares and three-point reference planes.

of f(x,y) over the specified range of x

In   this   case,   use   of   either   the   focal   plane   or   the
reference plane results in the same answer.
NOTE 5:  GBIR,  the  flatness  TIR  with  an  ideal  global  back
surface reference plane, is equal to the TTV.  However, TTV
can  be  obtained  from  the  t(x,y)  data  set  without  construction
of the reference plane.
13. 3.5  Determine  focal  plane  deviation  (FPD)  using
the  focal  plane.    The  FPD  is  given  by  the  larger  of
|f(x,y)

13. 3.6  Record the determined values.
13. 3.7  For  referee  or  other  measurements  where  the

maximum,    minimum,    sample    standard    deviation,

flatness less than or equal to a specified value, or

15. 1  Twenty-three    200    mm    diameter,    single-side
polished silicon wafers were employed in a round-robin
experiment.    These  wafers  represented  three  different
manufacturing  processes.    All  three  subsets  were  bare
on  the  front  surface.    Two  subsets  were  bare  on  the
back  surface  and  one  subset  had  oxide  on  the  back
surface.
15. 2  Eight  laboratories  measured  thickness.    Six  of
these  laboratories  also  measured  flatness.    Each  of  the
twenty-three   wafers   was   measured   three   times   in
succession  (in  three  cassette-to-cassette  “passes”),  on  a
single   day   on   automatic   measurement   systems,   in
accordance with this test method.
15. 3  All  measurement  data  were  acquired  with  3  mm
nominal edge exclusion.
15. 4  Flatness  values  were  calculated  in  an  array  of  15
by 15 mm sites, and a 7.5 mm array offset in both
x and
y  directions,  relative  to  the  wafer  center.    Within  this
137-site array, precision statistics were derived for four
selected  sites,  two  “full”  sites  in  the  central  area  and
two   “partial”   sites   along   the   FQA   boundary,   as
indicated in Table 2.  Figure 2 shows these sites within
the complete 137-site array.

15. 5  The    number    of    laboratories,    samples,    and
determinations    in    this    study    met    the    minimum
requirements  for  determining  precision  prescribed  in
ASTM Practice E 691.

which two measurements are considered statistically to
be  the  same,  for  within-laboratory  repeatability  (r)  and
between-laboratory  reproducibility  (R)  are  shown  in
Table 3.

TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN
SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF
PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  for  publication  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  16,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org

September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.    Original  edition  published  by  ASTM  International  as
ASTM F 1535-94.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1535-00.
1  Purpose
1. 1  If the free carrier density of a semiconductor is not
too high, the carrier recombination lifetime is controlled
by  impurity  centers  that  have  energies  located  in  the
forbidden  energy  gap.    Many  metallic  impurities  form
such  recombination  centers  in  silicon.    In  most  cases,
very  small  densities  of  these  impurities  (≈10
10
to  10
13

atoms/cm
3
)  reduce  the  carrier  recombination  lifetime
and adversely affect device and circuit performance.  In
some cases, such as very fast bipolar switching devices
and     high     power     devices,     the     recombination
characteristics must be carefully controlled to obtain the
desired device performance.
1. 2  This test method covers a procedure for measuring
carrier  recombination  lifetime  in  a  variety  of  types  of
silicon  wafers.    Because  electrical  contact  is  not  made
to the wafer during the test, additional processing steps
can be carried out following the test if wafer cleanness
is maintained.
1. 3  This test method is suitable for use in research and
development, process control, and materials acceptance
applications.    However,  because  the  precision  of  this
test    method    has    not    yet    been    established    by
interlaboratory  test,  it  should  be  used  for  materials
specification and acceptance only after the parties to the
test have established reproducibility and correlation.
2  Scope
2. 1  This test method covers the measurement of carrier
lifetime  appropriate  to  carrier  recombination  processes
in homogeneously doped, polished, n- or p-type silicon
wafers  with  room-temperature  resistivity  greater  than
about 0.05 Ω·cm.  This test method may also be applied
to the measurement of carrier recombination lifetime in
as-cut,   lapped,   or   etched   wafers   provided   that   the
sensitivity   of   the   conductivity   detection   system   is
adequate.
2. 2  In   this   test   method,   the   decay   of   the   wafer
conductivity  following  generation  of  excess  carriers
with  a  light  pulse  is  determined  by  monitoring  the
microwave reflectivity of the wafer.  Since no contact is
made    to    the    specimen,    this    test    method    is
nondestructive.      If   wafer   cleanness   is   maintained,
wafers  may  be  further  processed  following  testing  by
this test method.
2. 3  Depending  on  the  level  of  photoexcitation,  the
carrier  recombination  lifetime  determined  by  this  test
method   may   be   the   minority-carrier   lifetime   (low
injection level) or a mixture of minority- and majority-
carrier   lifetimes   (intermediate   and   high   injection
levels).    In  the  latter  case,  the  minority  and  majority
carrier    lifetimes    may    be    separated    under    some
conditions if a single recombination center that follows
the Shockley-Read-Hall model is assumed (see Related
Information 1).
2. 4  This     test     method     is     appropriate     for     the
measurement  of  carrier  recombination  lifetimes  in  the
range from 0.25 μs to >1 ms.  The shortest measurable
lifetime    values    are    governed    by    the    turn-off
characteristics  of  the  light  source  and  by  the  sampling
frequency of the decay signal analyzer while the longest
values  are  determined  by  the  geometry  of  the  test
specimen  and  the  degree  of  passivation  of  the  wafer
surface.    With  suitable  passivation  procedures,  such  as
thermal  oxidation  or  immersion  in  a  suitable  solution,
lifetimes   as   long   as   tens   of   milliseconds   can   be
determined   in   polished   wafers   with   thickness   as
specified in SEMI M1.
NOTE 1:  Carrier    recombination    lifetime    of    large    bulk
specimens  can  be  determined  by  Method  A  or  B  of  SEMI
MF28.      These   test   methods,   which   are   also   based   on
measurement   of   photoconductivity   decay   (PCD),   require
electrical  contacts  to  the  specimen.    In  addition,  they  assume
large  surface  recombination  on  all  surfaces  and  so  the  upper
limit of measurable lifetime is governed by the size of the test
specimen.    Method  B  of  SEMI  MF28  stipulates  that  the  test
be carried out under conditions of low injection to ensure that
the  minority-carrier  lifetime  is  determined.    Minority-carrier
lifetime can also be deduced from the carrier diffusion length
as  measured  by  the  surface  photovoltage  (SPV)  method  in
accordance  with  Method  A  or  B  of  SEMI  MF391.    When
carried  out  under  low  injection  conditions,  both  the  SPV
method and the PCD method should yield the same values of
minority-carrier lifetime
1
under certain conditions.  First, it is

1  Saritas, M., and McKell, H.  D., “Comparison of Minority-Carrier
Diffusion Length Measurements in Silicon by the Photoconductive


SEMI MF1535-1104 © SEMI 2004 2
required  that  carrier  trapping  not  occur.    Second,  correct
values of absorption coefficient and minority-carrier mobility
must  be  used  in  analyzing  the  SPV  measurements.    Third,
surface  recombination  effects  must  be  eliminated  (as  in  the
present  test  method)  or  properly  accounted  for  (as  in  SEMI
MF28)   in   carrying   out   the   PCD   measurements.      The
generation  lifetime,  which  is  another  transient  characteristic
of  semiconductor  materials,  is  typically  orders  of  magnitude
larger   than   the   recombination   lifetime.      Although   SEMI
MF1388 covers the measurement of the generation lifetime in
silicon wafers, the recombination lifetime can also be deduced
from  capacitance-time  measurements  made  at  temperatures
above   room   temperature   (≥70°C)   using   the   same   MOS
capacitor structure.
2

2. 5  Interpretation   of   measurements   to   identify   the
cause or nature of impurity centers is beyond the scope
of this test method.  However, some aspects of deriving
this  information  from  carrier  recombination  lifetime
measurements   alone   are   discussed   in   the   related
information    sections.        Use    of    “injection    level
spectroscopy”
3
is  discussed  in  Related  Information  1
and  use  of  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  carrier
recombination    lifetime    as    determined    with    low-
injection  level
4
is  discussed  in  Related  Information  2.
The identity and density of impurity centers found to be
present in the wafer by means of recombination lifetime
measurements may usually be determined more reliably
from     deep-level     transient     spectroscopy     (DLTS)
measurements  made  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF978
or    from    other    capacitance    or    current    transient
spectroscopy techniques provided that a suitable catalog
of impurity characteristics is available.
5

2. 6  Metallic     impurities     that     affect     the     carrier
recombination   lifetime   may   be   introduced   into   the
wafer  during  various  processing  steps,  especially  those
that involve high temperatures.  Analysis of procedures
for detection of contamination sources (see Section 6.4)
is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  test  method.    Although  the
test method is generally nonselective, certain individual
impurity species can be identified under very restricted
conditions  (see  Section  6.3,  Related  Information  1  and
Related Information 2).

NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  user  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  Higher   mode   decay   of   photoinjected   carriers
influences the shape of the decay signal, particularly in
its  early  phases.
6
These  effects  are  minimized  by
measuring  the  decay  after  the  higher  modes  have  died
away  (beginning  below  50%  of  the  maximum  decay
signal).
3. 2  If the lifetime of the carriers is such that the carrier
diffusion  length  is  greater  than  0.1  times  the  wafer
thickness,  the  effects  of  recombination  at  the  surfaces
of  the  wafer  must  be  suppressed  by  thermal  oxidation
or  by  immersion  in  a  suitable  electrolyte  (see  Section
11).
3. 2.1  Treatments  with  electrolyte  solutions  must  result
in  a  stable  surface  for  the  test  method  to  produce
reliable results.
3. 2.2  A further caution is in order if thermal oxidation
is employed.  Particularly in high oxygen wafers, oxide
precipitates  may  form  in  the  bulk  of  the  wafer  during
oxidation.    The  presence  of  such  precipitates  can  alter
the  recombination  properties  of  the  wafer  (see  also
Section 3.4) thus rendering the test specimen unsuitable
for measurement by this test method.
3. 2.3  Externally   gettered   wafers   may,   under   some
conditions,     yield     erroneous     values     of     carrier
recombination   lifetime   when   measured   by   this   test
method.    Results  of  measurements  on  such  wafers
should be checked very thoroughly for validity.
3. 3  The  method  is  not  suitable  for  measurement  of
recombination  lifetime  in  very  thin  films  of  silicon.    If
the thickness of the test specimen is comparable with or
smaller than the inverse of the absorption coefficient of
the incident radiation, the decay curve may be distorted
by  the  spatial  dependence  of  the  generation  of  excess
carriers.
3. 4  Variations  in  carrier  recombination  properties  in
the  direction  perpendicular  to  the  wafer  surface  may
result    in    inaccurate    determinations    of    the    bulk
recombination  lifetime.    These  variations  may  arise
because of the presence (1) of p-n or high-low (p-p
+
or
n-n
+
)   junctions   parallel   with   the   surface   or   (2)   of
regions   of   dissimilar   recombination   characteristics

New York, 1987) Section 10.4.

(such  as  a  wafer  with  oxide  precipitates  and  a  surface
denuded region free of such precipitates).
3. 5  The  recombination  characteristics  of  impurities  in
silicon    are    strongly    temperature    dependent.        If
comparisons  between  measurements  are  to  be  made
(that  is,  before  and  after  a  process  step  or  at  a  supplier
and a customer), both measurements should be made at
the same temperature.
3. 6  Different     impurity     centers     have     different
recombination  characteristics.    Therefore,  if  more  than
one  type  of  recombination  center  is  present  in  the
wafer, the decay may consist of contributions with two
or  more  time  constants.    The  recombination  lifetime
deduced   from   such   a   decay   curve   may   not   be
representative of any of the individual centers.
3. 7  The  recombination  characteristics  of  an  impurity
center  depend  on  the  dopant  type  and  density  of  the
wafer  as  well  as  the  position  of  the  energy  level  of  the
impurity   center   in   the   forbidden   energy   gap   (see
Related Information 3).

provided that the density of excess carriers is very small
compared  with  the  density  of  majority  carriers  (low

the  recombination  of  excess  minority  carriers  at  the

to the product of the hole or electron charge and hole or

6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1  Excess hole-electron pairs are locally created in the
wafer for a very brief time by a short pulse (width ≤200
ns,  rise  and  fall  times  ≤25  ns)  of  light  with  energy
slightly  greater  than  the  width  of  the  forbidden  energy
gap  at  a  specified  power  density  (injection  level).    The
specimen  surface  is  conditioned  in  such  a  way  that
surface  recombination  has  a  negligible  effect  on  the
decay  of  the  conductivity  following  cessation  of  the
light  pulse.    This  decay  is  monitored  by  means  of
microwave  reflectance,  and  the  carrier  recombination
lifetime  is  determined  as  the  time  constant  of  the
appropriate   portion   of   the   exponential   conductivity
decay.
6. 2  A  narrow-beam  light  source  may  be  used  so  that
measurements  may  be  made  repeatedly  at  different
localized  points  on  the  wafer  to  obtain  a  map  of  the
distribution of carrier recombination lifetime.
6. 3  The   measurement   may   be   repeated   at   several
different values of specific parameters, such as injection
level  (light  source  intensity)  or  temperature  in  order  to
obtain more detailed information about the nature of the
recombination centers.
6. 4  A  process  step  that  acts  as  a  contamination  source
can     sometimes     be     identified     by     comparing
measurements  of  carrier  recombination  lifetime  made
before and after the step.
7  Apparatus
7. 1  Pulsed   Light   Source   —   A   laser   diode   with
wavelength  between  0.9  and  1.1  μm.    Pulse  length  is
nominally ≤200  ns,  and  the  rise  and  fall  times  are  ≤25
ns (Note 2).  It is preferred that the output power of the
light  source  be  variable  such  that  photon  densities
between  2.5  ×   10
10
and  2.5  ×  10
15
photon/cm
2
are
generated at the wafer surface during the pulse.
NOTE 2:  The  rise  and  fall  times  of  the  pulsed  light  source
and  the  sampling  time  of  the  signal  conditioner  (see  Section
7. 5) should be ≤0.1 of the shortest lifetime to be measured.
7. 2  Photon  Detector  —  Suitable  means,  such  as  a
semitransparent  mirror  in  the  light  path  at  an  angle  of
45°  and  a  silicon  photodetector,  to  provide  feedback
control  to  maintain  the  laser  power  at  a  constant  level
appropriate to the specified injection level.
7. 3  Microwave    Pick-Up    System    —    Including    a
microwave  source  operating  at  a  nominal  frequency  of
10 ± 0.5 GHz and an apparatus for measuring reflected
power,  such  as  a  circulator,  an  antenna,  and  a  detector
(see  Figure  1).    The  sensitivity  of  the  detection  system
shall  be  as  great  as  possible  to  permit  measurement  of
photoconductivity decay at low injection levels.

7. 4  Wafer  Mounting  Stage  —  For  holding  the  wafer
(with vacuum hold down) in the desired position under
the pulsed light source.  The stage may contain a heater
for controlling its temperature over a small temperature
range  above  room  temperature.    It  may  be  driven  by
computer   controlled   motors   to   provide   x-y   or   r-
θ
motion  for  mapping  capability  over  the  wafer  surface
and  may  have  automatic  wafer  loader  and  transport  to
facilitate  automatic  sequential  measurement  of  a  group
of wafers.
7. 5  System   for   Analysis   of   the   Decay   Signal   —
Appropriate signal conditioners and display unit (real or
virtual oscilloscope with suitable time sweep and signal
sensitivity).      The   signal   conditioner   shall   have   a
bandwidth ≥40 MHz, or a minimum sampling time ≤25
ns (Note 2).  The display unit shall have a continuously
calibrated  time  base  with  accuracy  and  linearity  better
than  3%.    The  system  shall  be  such  that  the  time
constant  of  user-specified  portions  of  the  decay  signal
can be established independently.
7. 6  Computer  System  —  Although  the  measurement
can  be  made  manually,  it  is  recommended  that  it  be
carried   out   using   a   suitable   computer   system   that
controls  the  wafer  loading,  stage  motion,  the  pulse  and
detector   operation,   decay   signal   analysis,   statistical
analysis  of  the  data,  data  logging  and  storage,  and
printing or plotting of results.
7. 7  Facilities    for    Etching    or    Passivating    Wafer
Surfaces — If required.
7. 7.1  For   Chemical   Passivation   —   A   fume   hood
equipped  with  an  acid-proof  sink  and  suitable  beakers
or other containers for holding wet chemicals, including
hydrofluoric  acid  at  room  temperature  and  protective
gear appropriate to the chemicals used.
7. 7.2  For  Oxidation  —  A  clean  furnace  capable  of
high  quality  dry  oxidations  at  temperatures  of  950°  to
1050°C  and  associated  cleaning,  drying,  and  wafer
handling facilities.
7. 8  Wafer Holder — If required.  In some cases, it may
be necessary to measure the wafer while it is immersed
in a passivating solution (see Section 11).  In this case,
a  flat  chemically  inert,  optically  transparent  holder  is
required  to  contain  both  the  wafer  and  the  passivating
solution.
8  Reagents
8. 1  Purity of Reagents — All chemicals for which such
specifications  exist  shall  conform  to  Grade  1  SEMI
specifications   for   those   specific   chemicals.      Other
chemicals  shall  conform  to  reagent  grade,  as  specified
in  Reagent  Chemicals.
9
Other  grades  may  be  used,
provided  it  is  first  determined  that  the  chemical  is  of
sufficiently   high   purity   to   permit   its   use   without
lessening the accuracy of the test.
8. 2  Purity  of  Water  —  Reference  to  water  shall  be
understood   to   mean   Type   E-3   or   better   water   as
described in ASTM Guide D 5127.
8. 3  The    recommended    chemicals    shall    have    the
following nominal assays:
8. 3.1  Ethanol (CH
3
CH
2
OH) — Absolute, ≥99.9%.
8. 3.2  Iodine (I

) — >99.8%.
8. 3.3  Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) — Concentrated, 49.00 ±
0. 25%.      Warning:   see   Section   9.3   for   warning
statement.
8. 3.4  Nitric   Acid   (HNO
3
)   —   Concentrated,   70.0–
71. 0%.
8. 4  Iodine-Ethanol  Passivating  Solution  —  Mix  1  g
iodine with 100 mL ethanol.
NOTE 3:  Other    passivating    solutions    may    be    utilized
provided   that   they   (1)   reduce   the   surface   recombination
velocity  to  a  value  at  which  surface  recombination  no  longer
interferes  with  the  determination  of  the  bulk  recombination
lifetime (see Section 11), and (2) result in stable surfaces (see
Section 6.2.1).
8. 5  Bright  Etching  Solution,  for  Etching  Non-Polished
Surfaces — Mix 95 mL concentrated HNO
3
with 5 mL
concentrated   HF.      Warning:   See   Section   9.3   for
warning statement.
8. 6  Dilute  HF  Solution,  for  Etching  Surface  Oxide
Films  —  To  obtain  100  mL  of  a  2  %  solution  of  HF,
mix  4  mL  concentrated  HF  with  96  mL  of  water.
Warning: See Section 9.3 for warning statement.
9  Hazards
9. 1  The laser illumination system should be interlocked
so   that   direct   observation   of   the   laser   beam   is
prevented.      Warning:      Do   not   operate   the   laser
illumination system with the interlock disabled.
9. 2  The  microwave  system  should  be  shielded  and
interlocked  so  that  personnel  cannot  come  into  contact
with   the   beam.      Warning:      Do   not   operate   the
microwave system with the interlock disabled.

9. 3  The   chemicals   used   for   etching   and   for   some
surface  passivating  solutions  are  potentially  harmful
and  must  be  handled  in  an  acid  exhaust  fume  hood,
with  proper  protective  gear  including  safety  goggles,
and   with   utmost   care   at   all   times.      Warning:
Hydrofluoric  acid  solutions  are  particularly  hazardous.
HF  solutions  should  not  be  used  by  anyone  who  is  not
familiar with the specific preventive measures and first
aid  treatments  given  in  the  appropriate  Material  Safety
Data Sheet.
10  Sampling
10. 1  If   the   test   method   is   not   used   on   a   100%
inspection  basis,  sampling  procedures  shall  be  agreed
upon by the parties to the test.
10. 2  If  sampling  by  lot  is  required,  the  determination
of   what   constitutes   a   lot   and   the   procedures   for
sampling  and  the  procedures  for  sampling  by  lot  shall
be agreed upon by the parties to the test.
10. 3  Because    the    concentration    of    recombination
centers in a wafer may be non-uniform, it is desirable to
determine  the  recombination  lifetime  at  various  points
across   the   wafer   surface.      The   point   density   and
location of points measured shall be agreed upon by the
parties to the test.
11  Test Specimen Preparation
11. 1  The  required  test  specimen  preparation  depends
on  both  the  surface  condition  of  the  test  specimen  and
the   expected   magnitude   of   the   bulk   recombination
lifetime,
τ
b
, to be measured.
11. 2  No  test  specimen  preparation  is  required  if  the
value  of
τ
b
is  no  greater  than  one-tenth  of  the  surface
recombination  lifetime,
τ
s
.    The  surface  recombination
lifetime  is  composed  of  two  terms,  a  diffusion  term,
τ
diff
,  which  accounts  for  the  diffusion  of  carriers  to  the
surface,  and  a  surface  recombination  term,
τ
sr
,  which
accounts  for  the  recombination  at  the  surface.    The
surface  recombination  lifetime  may  be  computed  from
the following approximate relation:

Measurement on Silicon with Chemically Passivated Surface,”
Applied Surface Science, Vol 63, 1993, pp.  306–311.
S     =   surface recombination velocity, in cm/s, assumed
equal on both surfaces.
Electron  and  hole  surface  recombination  lifetimes  are
shown    in    Figure    2    as    a    function    of    surface
recombination   for   wafers   with   different   thickness
11

(Note 4).
NOTE 4:  If   S   is   very   large   (>10
4
cm/s)   excess   carriers
recombine  immediately  on  striking  the  surface  so  the  surface
recombination lifetime is dominated by
τ
diff
.  A well polished
surface  has  a  surface  recombination  velocity  of  ~10
4
cm/s
10

while    for    an    abraded    (lapped)    surface    the    surface
recombination  velocity  is  even  larger  (~10
7
cm/s,  the  carrier
saturation   velocity).      In   such   cases,   the   maximum   bulk
recombination lifetime that can be measured to 10% accuracy
in wafers of standard thickness is about 1 μs for p-type wafers
and about 2 μs for n-type wafers.  In spite of this limitation of
accurate  determination  of  the  bulk  recombination  lifetime,  it
is possible to detect relative variations of bulk recombination
lifetime   on   unpassivated   polished   wafers   that   have   bulk
recombination  lifetime  as  large  as  0.5  to  1  ms  provided  that
the following conditions are met:
(1)  the  diffusion  coefficient  and  surface  recombination
velocity are uniform over the wafer, and
(2)  the microwave system is sensitive enough to resolve
measured lifetimes which differ by 1%.
Under  these  same  conditions,  relative  measurements  can  be
made  on  lapped  wafers  with  bulk  recombination  lifetimes  up
to about 100 μs.  In this case, it may be necessary to etch the
surfaces in bright etching solution (see Section 8.5) for about
1  min  in  order  to  obtain  sufficient  uniformity  of  the  surface
recombination velocity.
11. 3  If  bulk  recombination  lifetimes  larger  than  about
0. 1
τ
s
are  to  be  measured,  the  wafer  surfaces  must  be
passivated by one of the following methods (Note 5) to
obtain accurate measurements.
11. 3.1  Oxidation —  Bulk  recombination  lifetimes  up
to  about  1  ms  can  be  measured  on  wafers  ≥0.5  mm
thick  that  have  a  very  high  quality  (dry)  thermal  oxide
(D
it
< 10
10
/cm
2
·eV) (Note 6).  Ensure that the oxidation
conditions  are  such  that  significant  numbers  of  oxide
precipitates do not form during the oxidation cycle (see
Section  3.2.2).    For  measurement  of  lifetimes  between
about 1 ms and 10 ms, strip the oxide in dilute HF (see
Section 8.6) and make the measurement within 15 min.



11  For these estimates, the diffusion coefficients were assumed to be
constant at the following limiting values: D
n
= 33.5 cm
2
/s and
D
p
= 12.4 cm
2
/s.  These values are somewhat smaller than the limiting
values given in the 1993 edition of DIN 50 440, Part 1.


SEMI MF1535-1104 © SEMI 2004 7


Note:  The maximum bulk recombination lifetime that can be accurately measured is about 1/10 of the surface lifetime.

Coefficient and Selected Values of Wafer Thickness
11. 3.2  Immersion   in   Passivating   Solution   —   To
measure bulk recombination lifetimes up to ~1 ms on a
bare  polished  wafer  ≥0.5  mm  thick,  first  pretreat  the
wafer   in   iodine-ethanol   passivating   solution   (see
Section   8.4)   or   an   alternative   passivating   solution.
Then  enclose  the  wafer  in  a  small  plastic  bag  or  other
fixture containing enough of the passivating solution to
coat the surface with a thin film while the measurement
is  being  made.    Ensure  that  the  passivation  technique
results  in  stable  and  repeatable  measurements  before
proceeding with the test (see Section 3.2.1).
11. 3.2.1  If  the  wafer  is  oxidized,  passivate  it  with
iodine-ethanol, an alternative passivating solution, after
first   removing   the   oxide   by   etching   in   dilute   HF
solution  for  a  time  that  depends  on  oxide  thickness;
etch times range from about 30 s for thin oxide (<5 nm)
to about 10 min for thick oxide (~200 nm).
11. 3.2.2  Again,  ensure  that  the  passivation  technique
results  in  stable  and  repeatable  measurements  before
proceeding with the test (see Section 3.2.1).
NOTE 5:  Polished   surfaces   that   have   been   oxidized   or
passivated with certain chemical solutions have much reduced
surface   recombination   velocity.      For   example,   carefully
prepared  thermally  oxidized  silicon  surfaces  have  surface
recombination  velocity  as  low  as  1.5  to  2.5  cm/s  while  the
surface  recombination  velocity  can  be  as  low  as  0.25  cm/s
following  stripping  of  the  oxide  in  hydrofluoric  acid.
12
This
reference  also  outlines  a  procedure  for  determining  surface
recombination  velocity.    Immersion  in  the  iodine-ethanol
passivating  solution  (Section  8.4)  has  been  shown  to  reduce
surface   recombination   velocity   of   a   chemically   polished,
oxide-free silicon wafer to ≤10 cm/s.

12  Procedure
NOTE 7:  The  following  procedures  are  given  in  sufficient
detail  for  manual  data  collection  and  analysis.    However  it  is
strongly  recommended  that  instrument  setup,  data  collection,
and   analysis   be   carried   out   using   computer-controlled
equipment, with data storage and display capabilities.  In such
cases,   the   procedures   and   algorithms   employed   must   be
equivalent to those given in this section.
12. 1  If they are not known, determine the conductivity
type  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF42,  the  center-point
wafer  thickness  in  accordance  with  SEMI  MF533  or
SEMI   MF1530,   and   the   center-point   resistivity   in
accordance   with   SEMI   MF84   or   SEMI   MF673.
Convert  the  resistivity  to  the  density  of  the  majority
carriers (n
maj
, in carriers/cm
3
) in accordance with SEMI
MF723.    Record  these  data  together  with  the  nominal
diameter  and  the  condition  (polished,  etched,  lapped,
as-cut, etc.) of the front and back surfaces.
12. 2  Record  the  temperature  of  the  room,  or  if  the
stage  is  temperature-controlled,  the  temperature  of  the
stage surface.
12. 3  Load  the  wafer  onto  the  stage  so  that  the  light
pulse will strike the desired region.
12. 4  Switch   on   the   pulsed   laser   light   source   (see
Section 7.1).
12. 5  Adjust  the  intensity  so  that  the  injection  level,
η,
is  at  the  specified  value.    If  an  injection  level  has  not
been  specified,  set  it  to  100.    If  it  is  not  adjusted

automatically by the apparatus, set the injection level as

12. 5.1  If   the   test   specimen   is   oxidized   and   the
thickness  of  the  oxide  layer  is  not  known,  measure  or
estimate  it,  using  a  method  acceptable  to  the  parties  to
the test.  Record the thickness.
12. 5.2  Determine   and   record   the   fraction   of   the
incident  light  that  penetrates  the  oxide  and  is  absorbed
by the specimen from the dashed curve in Figure 3.

Note:    For  these  calculations  the  wavelength  of  the  incident
radiation, λ , is assumed to be 905 nm, the index of refraction
of silicon is taken as 3.610, and the index of refraction of SiO
2

is  taken  as  1.462.    Maximum  absorption  occurs  at  an  oxide
thickness d = (2n + 1)λ/4  while  minimum  absorption  occurs
at   an   oxide   thickness   d = nλ/2,   when   n   =   0,   1,   2,   etc.
Therefore,  if  the  wavelength  of  the  incident  radiation,  λ
1
,
differs from 905 nm, these curves can be used by determining
the relative intensity for an effective oxide thickness d
0
= 905

12. 5.3  Adjust  the  light  source  intensity  so  that  the
photon density absorbed in the silicon during the pulse,
φ,  is  equal  to  η×n

,  where  η  is  the  desired  injection
level  and  n
maj
is  the  density  of  majority  carriers  in  the
wafer  as  determined  in  Section  12.1.    The  photon

12. 6  Turn  on  the  microwave  power  source  and  view
the photoconductivity decay on the display unit.  Adjust
the time and voltage scales so as to display the desired
portion   of   the   decay   signal.      In   the   absence   of
indications  to  the  contrary,  observe  the  decay  signal
from 45 to 5% of the peak voltage.
12. 7  Determine  that  the  decay  is  exponential  over  the
desired  range.    Determine  the  time  constant  by  fitting
an exponential curve to the voltage, V, as a function of
time, t, or (for manual data collection) a straight line to
the curve of lnV as a function of t.
12. 8  Record  this  time  constant  as  the  recombination
lifetime.
12. 9  If  desired,  move  the  wafer  position  and  repeat
Sections 12.6 through 12.8 as required to obtain a wafer
map, noting the point spacing and pattern together with
the radius of the mapped area.
12. 10  Alternatively,  if  desired,  repeat  Sections  12.2
and 12.6 through 12.8 at the same location for different
temperatures or repeat Sections 12.5 through 12.8 at the
same location for different values of injection level.
