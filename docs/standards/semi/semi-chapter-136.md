8. 2  Color ó Using a colorimeter, compare sample in a
specific  glass  tube  with  flat  bottom,  graduated  at  113
and  250  mm,  with  a  standardized  color  reference  disk
CAA (Scale 2.5 to 30 APHA units).
8. 3  Water   Use  a  Karl  Fischer  (KF)  coulometer,
consisting  of  a  titration  beaker,  an  electrode  generator
and  an  electrode  indicator  with  double  platinum  wire;
having as reagents Hydranal Coulomat A solution at the
anode   and   Hydranal   Coulomat   C   solution   at   the
cathode.    Add  500  μl  of  sample,  taking  care  to  protect
the  sample  from  moisture.    Read  directly  the  water
content of sample in μg of water.
8. 4  Acidity   Use  a  potentiograph  with  a  compound
glass electrode and a titration vat with nitrogen inlet. To
100  mL  of  sample  add  5  mL  of  water,  5  mL  of
methanol  and  2  drops  of  titan  yellow  under  nitrogen-
stream.    The    titration    is    performed    with    N/100
tetrabutylammonium        hydroxide        (TBAH)        in
isopropanol.  The  equivalence  point  is  at  about  −400
mV.  The  density  (see  SEMI  C1)  of  the  Dimethyl
sulfoxide  sample  to  be  titrated  must  be  determined  to
express the result in (meq/g).
8. 5  Residue  after  Evaporation
  The  residue  after
evaporation is defined as the relative amount of residue


SEMI C53-0704 © SEMI 2001, 2004  DIMETHYL SULFOXIDE 2
remaining  after  evaporation  of  a  sample  of  DMSO

mL beaker at 105∞C in an oven for 30 min., cool for 30
min.  in  a  dessicator  charged  with  calcium  chloride  and
weigh.  Place  100  g  of  DMSO  into  the  200  mL  tared
beaker. Evaporate the liquid gently, so that boiling does
not  occur,  in  a  hood  protected  from  any  possibility  of
contamination. When all the sample has evaporated, dry
the residue in an oven at 105∞C for 30 minutes and cool
the  beaker  for  30  min  in  a  dessicator  charged  with
calcium chloride and reweigh.
8. 5.1  Calculate the residue as parts per million (ppm).
8. 6  Trace   Metal   Determination   ó   The   following
method  has  given  satisfactory  results  in  determining
trace metal impurities at the value specified for each of
the  following  trace  metals:  aluminum  (Al),  antimony
(Sb),  arsenic  (As),  barium  (Ba),  boron  (B),  cadmium
(Cd),  calcium  (Ca),  chromium  (Cr),  copper  (Cu),  iron
(Fe),    lead    (Pb),    lithium    (Li),    magnesium    (Mg),
manganese  (Mn),  nickel  (Ni),  potassium  (K),  sodium
(Na),  tin  (Sn),  titanium  (Ti),  vanadium  (V)  and  zinc
(Zn).    Alternate  methods  may  be  used  as  long  as  the
method has been validated according to SEMI C1.
8. 7  Special Reagents

Figure 1
Safety Alert Symbols for Signal Word Panel Use
5. 5  safety label — a sign, label, or decal that provides safety information.
5. 6  signal  word  — the  word  that  calls  attention  to  the  safety  label  and  designates  a  degree  or  level  of  hazard
seriousness.
5. 7   surround  shape  —  a  geometric  configuration  that  is  placed  around  a  symbol  and  which  conveys  additional
safety information.
5. 8  symbol — a graphical representation, either abstract or representational, of a hazard, a consequence of engaging
a hazard, or a method to avoid a hazard, or some combination of these ideas.
NOTE 6: Some label design standards use the term “pictorial” in the same sense as this guideline uses the term “symbol.”
5. 9  target audience — the audience to be advised of the hazard.
6  General Provisions
6. 1   Safety  labels  should  communicate  information  about  specific  hazards.  Safety  labels  should  be  simple,  direct,
and understandable by the target audience.
6. 2  Content — Safety labels should communicate:
6. 2.1  the seriousness of the hazard (indicated by the signal word);
6. 2.2  the nature of the hazard (e.g., type of hazard) or the probable consequence of engaging the hazard; and
6. 2.3  how the hazard can be avoided.
6. 3  See Figure 2 for examples of how this information can be communicated on a safety label.

Figure 2
Examples of How Product Safety Labels Communicate Content
(Note that the order and content of the word message is flexible).
6. 4  Identifier — Safety labels should have a unique identifier (e.g., a part number) printed on the label, to facilitate
ordering replacement labels from the equipment manufacturer.
NOTE 7: If a safety label becomes illegible, the user may want to replace it.
6. 5  Durability — Safety labels should have a reasonable useful life. Determination of reasonable useful life should
take into consideration the expected life of the product and the intended environment of use.
NOTE 8: Two  factors  that  may  be  used  for  judging  useful  life  are  color  stability  and  legibility  when  viewed  at  a  safe  viewing
distance.  Legibility is affected by letter height.
7  Formats
7. 1  Safety labels should consist of at least three panels: signal word panel, word message panel, and symbol panel.
Figure 3 provides examples of some possible horizontal and vertical formats incorporating these panels.
EXCEPTION 1: A symbol panel is not necessary for labels that indicate only potential property damage hazards.
EXCEPTION 2: When space limitations exist, such as under guards or on small parts, for safety labels whose target
audience is maintenance or service personnel, symbol-only formats with surround shapes (i.e., no signal word, word
message, or symbol panels; see Figures 7, 8, and 9) may be used. In this case, borders around the surround shapes
should be used. Alternatively, for the same situations, a safety label may be used that has a signal word panel and a
word message panel but does not have a symbol panel.

8  Signal Words
8. 1  The signal words for safety labels are DANGER, WARNING, and CAUTION.
8. 1.1   DANGER  is  the  signal  word  used  to  indicate  an  imminently  hazardous  situation  that,  if  not  avoided,  will
result in death or severe injury. This signal word is to be limited to the most extreme situations.
8. 1.2  WARNING is the signal word used to indicate a potentially hazardous situation which, if not avoided, could
result in death or severe injury.
8. 1.3   CAUTION  is  the  signal  word  used  to  indicate  a  potentially  hazardous  situation  which,  if  not  avoided,  could
result in moderate or minor injury. It may also be used to alert against unsafe practices.
NOTE 9: CAUTION without the safety alert symbol may be used as a signal word to indicate a potentially hazardous situation
which, if not avoided, could result in property damage.
NOTE 10: SEMI S10 contains examples of ways to categorize severe, moderate, and minor injuries.
8. 2  The signal word is placed in the signal word panel.
8. 2.1   For  DANGER,  WARNING,  and  CAUTION  signal  words,  the  safety  alert  symbol  (see  Figure  1)  is  located
immediately to the left of and on the same level as the signal word (see Figure 5).



SEMI S1-0701

Figure 5
Signal Word Panels

8. 2.2  The safety alert symbol should not be used to alert persons to property-damage-only hazards.
8. 2.3  When multiple hazard situations are addressed on one safety label, and the hazards are classified at different
levels of seriousness, the signal word corresponding to the greatest hazard level should be used.
9  Symbols
9. 1  Symbols are graphic representations chosen to convey specific safety messages.
9. 2  The symbol panel should contain the safety label’s symbol(s).
9. 2.1  More than one symbol panel may be used on a safety label.
NOTE 11: See also Section 7.2.
9. 2.2  More than one symbol may be used in each symbol panel.
9. 3  Symbols may be used to clarify or supplement a portion of a safety label’s word message.
NOTE 12: In some cases, symbols may replace the word message. See the exception to Section 10.2.
9. 4   A  symbol  should  represent  the  nature  of  the  hazard,  or  the  potential  consequence  of  engaging  the  hazard,  or
actions to be taken to avoid the hazard.
9. 5  Symbols should be compatible with the safety label’s word message.
NOTE 13: It is preferable to use the symbols shown in Appendix 1.
NOTE 14: For additional information on symbol design, see Annex A of ANSI Z535.3.
9. 6  Symbols should be shown in their appropriate surround shape as defined in Section 9.10.
9. 7   When  an  effective  symbol  does  not  exist  or  cannot  be  created  to  illustrate  the  specific  hazard  or  specific
avoidance  information,  the  ISO  3864  general  warning  symbol  should  be  used  with  a  text  message  that  conveys
specific information about the hazard (see Figure 6).

10. 1  The word message is placed in the word message panel.
10. 2   The  word  message  preferably  contains  a  description  of  the  hazard,  the  consequence  of  engaging  the  hazard,
and how to avoid the hazard. The ordering of this content in the word message is flexible.
EXCEPTION: Parts or all of the word message may be omitted, depending on such factors as whether the message
can be inferred from a symbol, other text messages, user training, or the context in which the safety label is used.
10. 3  The word message on a safety label should be concise and readily understood.
10. 4   Messages  on  the  same  safety  label  that  warn  of  different  hazards  should  be  formatted,  when  feasible,  to
prevent them from visually blending together. Bullets, lines, and extra line spacing are examples of such formatting.
10. 5  When detailed instructions, precautions, or consequences would require a lengthy message, the message may
alternatively refer the reader to another source for additional safety information. Examples of such sources include
safety instructions, operation and maintenance manuals, service manuals, operating procedures, and safety bulletins.
11  Lettering
11. 1  Signal words should be in the lettering style shown in Appendix 2.

11. 2  For languages using the “Roman” alphabet, such as the official languages used in the Americas and in much of
the European Union, the lettering should be a combination of upper- and lowercase sans serif letters. Uppercase only
lettering may be used for short messages or for emphasis of individual words.
NOTE 17: Preferred  Roman  sans  serif  lettering  styles  include  those  named  Arial,  Arial  Bold,  Folio  Medium,  Franklin  Gothic,
Helvetica, Helvetica Bold, and Univers.
11. 3  Lettering should be of a size that enables a person with normal vision, including corrected vision, to read the
safety label at a safe viewing distance from the hazard.
NOTE 18: Related Information 1 provides an example of a method of calculating minimum letter heights.
NOTE 19: The proportions and spacing of individual letters also affect readability.
12  Colors
12. 1  Color Specifications — Colors should conform to those colors specified in ISO 3864.
NOTE 20: For purposes of reproduction, the closest PANTONE
®
color match for opaque safety colors is:
• Red – PANTONE 485
• Orange – PANTONE 152
• Yellow – PANTONE 109
• Blue – PANTONE 2945
(PANTONE
®
is a registered trademark of Pantone, Inc.).
NOTE 21: Perceived  color  will  be  different  under  colored  light  (e.g.,  “yellow  room”)  conditions.  The  committee  knows  of  no
current technical solution.
12. 2   Symbol  and  Surround  Shape  Color  Specifications  —  See  section  9.10  for  symbol  and  surround  shape  color
criteria.
12. 3  Signal Word Panel — The three signal words should be colored as follows (see Figure 5):
12. 3.1  The word DANGER should be in white letters on a red background.
12. 3.2  The word WARNING should be in black letters on an orange background.
12. 3.3  The word CAUTION should be in black letters on a yellow background.
12. 3.4  Safety Alert Symbol — The solid triangle portion should be the same color as the signal word lettering, and
the exclamation mark portion should be the same color as the signal word panel background.
12. 4  Optional Use of Red — The color red may be used in a symbol to indicate heat or fire.
13  Placement
13. 1   Location  of  Safety  Labels  —  Safety  labels  should  be  permanently  attached  to  the  equipment  and,  when
possible, located near the hazard.
13. 2  Safe Viewing Distance —  Safety labels should be placed to allow the viewer enough time to:
• be informed by the safety label; and
• have sufficient time to avoid the hazard or take appropriate evasive action to reduce the potential harm from the
hazard.
13. 3  Placement —  Safety  labels  should  be  placed  so  that  they  are  legible,  non-distracting,  and  not  hazardous  in
themselves.
13. 4   Inadvertent  Removal,  Visual  Blockage  —  Safety  labels  should  not  be  located  in  areas  where  they  may  be
removed by the motion of equipment or rendered ineffective by situational conditions.
13. 4.1  Safety labels should not be blocked from view by moveable panels such as doors, windows, and racks where
this would limit the effectiveness of the blocked label.

APPENDIX 1
SAFETY SYMBOLS
NOTE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI S1 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures on April 30,
2001 by the North American Regional Standards Committee.
This  appendix  illustrates  symbols  used  on  safety  labels  for  hazards  commonly  found  in  the  semiconductor
manufacturing  industry.  Additional  symbols  may  need  to  be  developed  for  other  hazards  (see  ANSI  Z535.3-1998
Informative Annex A for an example of symbol development guidelines).
To determine what symbol should be used on a safety label, it is first necessary to determine what message is to be
communicated.  Symbols  may  enhance  a  safety  label’s  meaning  and  may  be  useful  to  communicate  across  many
languages.
When appropriate, the following symbols should be used.
NOTE A1-1: Some symbols (e.g., laser, biohazard, and radiation) are required by law or regulation in some jurisictions.

NOTICE:   A   new   Appendix   will   be   added   (in
numerical  order)  upon  July  1,  2006  publication  as
shown  in  Delayed  Revisions  Section  1.    The  EH&S
Committee has voted that addition of this Appendix
section is OPTIONAL before the Effective Date.
2. 3  Precedence  of  Sectional  Requirements  —  In  the
case of conflict between provisions in different sections
of  this  guideline,  the  section  or  subsection  specifically
addressing the technical issue takes precedence over the
more general section or subsection.
NOTICE:  This  safety  guideline  does  not  purport  to
address  all  of  the  safety  issues  associated  with  its  use.
It   is   the   responsibility   of   the   users   of   this   safety
guideline  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health
practices  and  determine  the  applicability  of  regulatory
or other limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  This  guideline  is  intended  for  use  by  supplier  and
user  as  a  reference  for  EHS  considerations.  It  is  not
intended  to  be  used  to  verify  compliance  with  local
regulatory requirements.
3. 2  It is not the philosophy of this guideline to provide
all  of  the  detailed  EHS  design  criteria  that  may  be
applied   to   semiconductor   manufacturing   equipment.
This  guideline  provides  industry-specific  criteria,  and
refers   to   some   of   the   many   international   codes,
regulations, standards, and specifications that should be
considered        when        designing        semiconductor
manufacturing equipment.
3. 3  Existing models and subsystems should continue to
meet  the  provisions  of  SEMI  S2-93A.  Models  with
redesigns  that  significantly  affect  the  EHS  aspects  of
the  equipment  should  conform  to  the  latest  version  of
SEMI  S2.  This  guideline  is  not  intended  to  be  applied
retroactively.
3. 4  In  many  cases,  references  to  standards  have  been
incorporated  into  this  guideline.  These  references  do
not imply applicability of the entire standards, but only
of the sections referenced.
4  Referenced Standards
NOTICE: New Referenced Standards will be added
(in  alphabetical  or  numerical  order  as  appropriate)
upon  July  1,  2006  publication  as  shown  in  Delayed
Revisions  Section  1.    The  EH&S  Committee  has
voted   that   implementation   of   the   information   is
OPTIONAL before the effective date.

6  Safety Philosophy
6. 1  A  primary  objective  of  the  industry  is  to  eliminate
or  control  hazards  during  the  equipment’s  life  cycle
(i.e.,  the  installation,  operation,  maintenance,  service,
and disposal of equipment).
6. 2  The     assumption     is     made     that     operators,
maintenance   personnel,   and   service   personnel   are
trained in the tasks that they are intended to perform.
6. 3  The  following  should  be  considered  in  the  design
and construction of equipment:
• regulatory requirements;
• industry standards;
• this guideline; and
• good engineering and manufacturing practices.
6. 4  This guideline should be applied during the design,
construction,     and     evaluation     of     semiconductor
equipment,   in   order   to   reduce   the   expense   and
disruptive effects of redesign and retrofit.
NOTICE:    Section  6.5  below  will  be  withdrawn
upon  July  1,  2006  publication  and  replaced  by  the
new  Section  6.5  including:  figures  and  tables  as
shown  in  Delayed  Revisions  Section  2.    The  EH&S
Committee  has  voted  that  implementation  of  the
information is OPTIONAL before the effective date.
6. 5  No   reasonably   foreseeable   single-point   failure
condition or operational error should allow exposure of
personnel,  facilities,  or  the  community  to  hazards  that
could  result  in  death,  significant  injury,  or  significant
equipment damage.
NOTE 7:  The  intent  is  to  control  single  fault  conditions  that
result in significant risks (i.e., Critical, High, or Medium risks
based on the example risk assessment matrix in SEMI S10).
6. 6  Equipment safety features should be fail-safe or of
a fault-tolerant design and construction.
6. 7  Components  and  assemblies  should  be  used  in
accordance   with   their   manufacturers’   ratings   and
specifications,  where  using  them  outside  the  ratings
would create a safety hazard.
6. 8  A  hazard  analysis  should  be  performed  to  identify
and  evaluate  hazards.  The  hazard  analysis  should  be


SEMI S2-0703a
E
© SEMI 1991, 2004 8
initiated  early  in  the  design  phase,  and  updated  as  the
design matures.
NOTICE:    Section  6.8.1  below  will  be  withdrawn
upon  July  1,  2006  publication  and  replaced  by  the
new  Section  6.8.1  including:  figures  and  tables  as
shown  in  Delayed  Revisions  Section  2.    The  EH&S
Committee  has  voted  that  implementation  of  the
information is OPTIONAL before the effective date.
6. 8.1  The hazard analysis should include consideration
of:
• the application or process;
• the hazards associated with each task;
• anticipated failure modes;
• the  probability  of  occurrence  and  severity  of  a
mishap;
• the level of expertise of exposed personnel and the
frequency of exposure;
• the    frequency    and    complexity    of    operating,
servicing and maintenance tasks; and
• safety critical parts.
NOTE 8:  EN  1050  contains  examples  of  hazard  analysis
methods.
6. 8.2  The   risks   associated   with   hazards   should   be
characterized using SEMI S10.
6. 9  The  order  of  precedence  for  resolving  identified
hazards should be as follows:
6. 9.1  Design  to  Eliminate  Hazards  —  From  the  initial
concept  phase,  the  supplier  should  design  to  eliminate
hazards.
NOTE 9:  It  is  recommended  that  the  supplier  continue  to
work to eliminate identified hazards.
6. 9.2  Incorporate   Safety   Devices   —   If   identified
hazards  cannot  be  eliminated  or  their  associated  risk
adequately controlled through design selection, then the
risk  should  be  reduced  through  fixed,  automatic,  or
other protective safety design features or devices.
NOTE 10:  It  is  recommended  that  provisions  be  made  for
periodic functional checks of safety devices, when applicable.
6. 9.3  Provide  Warning  Devices  —  If  design  or  safety
devices  cannot  effectively  eliminate  identified  hazards
or adequately reduce associated risk, a means should be
used to detect the hazardous condition and to produce a
warning signal to alert personnel of the hazard.
6. 9.4  Provide  Hazard  Warning  Labels  —  Where  it  is
impractical    to    eliminate    hazards    through    design
selection  or  adequately  reduce  the  associated  risk  with
safety or warning devices, hazard warning labels should
be provided. See Section 10 for label information.
6. 9.5  Develop Administrative Procedures and Training
—  Where  hazards  are  not  eliminated  through  design
selection   or   adequately   controlled   with   safety   or
warning  devices  or  warning  labels,  procedures  and
training should be used. Procedures may include the use
of personal protective equipment.
6. 9.6  A   combination   of   these   approaches   may   be
needed.
7  General Provisions
7. 1  This guideline should be incorporated by reference
in  equipment  purchase  specifications.  The  user  and
supplier should agree on deviations from this guideline.
The   intent   is   for   the   user   to   purchase   equipment
conforming with SEMI S2, not to design the equipment.
7. 2  The   equipment   must   comply   with   laws   and
regulations  that  are  in  effect  at  the  location  of  use.  All
equipment    requiring    certification    or    approval    by
government  agencies  must  have  this  certification  or
approval as required by regulations.
NOTE 11:  It  is  recommended  that  the  supplier  request  from
the user information regarding local laws and regulations.
7. 3  The       manufacturer       should       maintain       an
equipment/product   safety   program   to   identify   and
eliminate  hazards  or  control  risks  in  accordance  with
the order of precedence (see Section 6.9).
7. 3.1  The supplier should provide the user’s designated
representative with bulletins that describe safety related
upgrades    or    newly    identified    significant    hazards
associated with the equipment. This should be done on
an ongoing basis as needed.
7. 4  Model-specific  tools  and  accessories  necessary  to
operate,  maintain,  and  service  equipment  safely  should
be  provided  with  the  equipment  or  specified  by  the
supplier.
NOTE 12:  The official values in this guideline are expressed
in The International System of Units (SI). Values that:
• are   expressed   in   Inch-Pound   (also   known   as   “US
Customary” or “English”) units,
• are enclosed in parentheses, and
• directly follow values expressed in SI units
• are  not  official,  are  provided  for  reference  only,  and
might not be exact conversions of the SI values.
8  Evaluation Process
8. 1  This section describes the evaluation of equipment
to  this  guideline,  the  contents  of  the  evaluation  report,


SEMI S2-0703a
E
© SEMI 1991, 2004 9

evaluation   report   should   include   only   the   manuals
(Section 9.6) and the design-specific sections (Sections
10  through  27).  The  Appendices  should  be  used  in  the
evaluation,  and  referenced  in  the  report,  only  as  they
pertain to the specific application.
8. 3.1  For each numbered section, the evaluation report
should   state   one   of   the   following,   and   provide
supporting rationale:
• “Conforms”  —  equipment  conforms  to  the  section
or to the intent of the section.
• “Does  not  Conform”  —  equipment  conforms  to
neither the section nor to the intent of the section.
• “N/A” — section is not applicable to equipment.
8. 3.1.1  The  results  of  a  risk  assessment  indicating  no
significant  risk  may  be  used  in  determining  that  the
equipment conforms to the intent of a section.
8. 3.1.2  The    evaluation    report    should    include    a
determination   per   SEMI   S10   of   the   level   of   risk
associated with nonconformance findings.
8. 3.1.3  Supporting  rationale  may  include  test  data  or
documented engineering rationale.

relevant   parts   of   the   equipment,   is   automatically
brought to a safe condition.


SEMI S2-0703a
E
© SEMI 1991, 2004 12
11. 4  Upon  activation,  the  safety  interlock  should  alert
the operator immediately.
EXCEPTION: Alerting the operator is not expected if a
safety  interlock  triggers  the  EMO  circuit  (see  Section
12) or otherwise removes power to the user interface.
NOTE 24:  An  explanation  of  the  cause  is  preferred  upon
activation of a safety interlock.
11. 5  Safety  interlock  systems  should  be  fault-tolerant
and  designed  so  that  the  functions  or  set  points  of  the
system    components    cannot    be    altered    without
disassembling,  physically  modifying,  or  damaging  the
device or component.
EXCEPTION:  When  safety  interlock  systems  having
adjustable  set  points  or  trip  functions  are  used,  access
should  be  limited  to  maintenance  or  service  personnel
by requiring a deliberate action, such as using a tool or
special   keypad   sequences,   to   access   the   adjustable
devices or to adjust the devices.
NOTE 25:  This  section  does  not  address  the  defeatability  of
safety interlocks. See Section 11.7 for additional information.
NOTICE:    Section  11.6  below  will  be  withdrawn
upon  July  1,  2006  publication  and  replaced  by  the
new  Section  11.6  including:  figures  and  tables  as
shown  in  Delayed  Revisions  Section  2.    The  EH&S
Committee  has  voted  that  implementation  of  the
information is OPTIONAL before the effective date.
11. 6  Electromechanical  devices  and  components  are
preferred.        Solid-state    devices    and    solid    state
components  may  be  used,  provided  that  the  safety
interlock  system,  or  relevant  parts  of  the  system,  are
evaluated  for  suitability  for  use  in  accordance  with
appropriate  standard(s).  The  evaluation  for  suitability
should   take   into   consideration   abnormal   conditions
such   as   overvoltage,   undervoltage,   power   supply
interruption,    transient    overvoltage,    ramp    voltage,
electromagnetic  susceptibility,  electrostatic  discharge,
thermal cycling, humidity, dust, vibration, and jarring.
EXCEPTION:   Where   the   severity   of   a   reasonably
foreseeable  mishap  is  deemed  to  be  Minor  per  SEMI
S10,  a  software-based  interlock  may  be  considered
suitable.
NOTE 26:  Where  a  safety  interlock  is  provided  to  safeguard
personnel    from    a    Severe    or    Catastrophic    mishap    as
categorized  by  SEMI  S10,  consideration  of  positive-opening
type switches is recommended.
NOTE 27:  Evaluation for suitability for use may also include
reliability,   self-monitoring,   and   redundancy   as   addressed
under standards such as NEMA ICS 1.1 and UL 991.
NOTE 28:  Solid-state devices include operational amplifiers,
transistors, and integrated circuits.
11. 6.1  FECS    may    be    used    in    conjunction    with
electromechanical     or     solid     state     devices     and
components  provided  the  programmable  safety  control
system   conforms   to   an   appropriate   standard   for
electronic  safety  systems.    Components  of  the  FECS
should   be   tested   and   certified   according   to   the
requirements   of   the   standard   used.      Examples   of
recognized  electronic  safety  systems  standards  include
IEC   61508   ISO   13849-1   (EN   954-1),   ANSI/ISA
SP84.01 DIN/V/VDE-0801.
NOTE 29:  Paragraph  13.4.3    states  additional  assessment
criteria for safety-related components and assemblies.
NOTE 30:  A FECS is a subsystem of a (PES) Programmable
Electronic  System.  IEC  61508  is  the  preferred  standard  for
complex PES.
NOTE 31:  Related    Information    14    provides    additional
information on applications of FECS design.
11. 7  The safety interlock system should be designed to
minimize  the  need  to  override  safety  interlocks  during
maintenance activities.
11. 7.1  Safety    interlocks    that    safeguard    personnel
during  operator  tasks  should  not  be  defeatable  without
the use of a tool.
11. 7.2  When  maintenance  access  is  necessary  to  areas
protected  by  interlocks,  defeatable  safety  interlocks
may  be  used,  provided  that  they  require  an  intentional
operation to bypass.
11. 7.2.1  Upon  exiting  or  completing  the  maintenance
mode,  all  safety  interlocks  should  be  automatically
restored.
11. 7.2.2  If    a    safety    interlock    is    defeated,    the
maintenance   manual   should   identify   administrative
controls  to  safeguard  personnel  or  to  minimize  the
hazard.
11. 8  The  restoration  of  a  safety  interlock  should  not
initiate  equipment  operation  or  parts  movement  where
this can give rise to a hazardous condition.
11. 9  Switches and other control device contacts should
be  connected  to  the  ungrounded  side  of  the  circuit  so
that  a  short  circuit  to  ground  does  not  result  in  the
interlocks being satisfied.
11. 10  Where   a   hazard   to   personnel   is   controlled
through  the  use  of  an  enclosure,  the  enclosure  should
either:  require  a  tool  to  gain  access  and  be  labeled
regarding    the    hazard    against    which    it    protects
personnel;  or  be  interlocked.  In  addition  to  enclosures,
physical  barriers  at  the  point  of  hazard  should  be
included where inadvertent contact is likely.
NOTE 32:  Where  the  removal  of  a  cover  exposes  a  hazard,
consider additional labels. See Section 10 for guidance.

12  Emergency Shutdown
12. 1  The  equipment  should  have  an  “emergency  off”
(EMO)  circuit.  The  EMO  actuator  (e.g.,  button),  when
activated,   should   place   the   equipment   into   a   safe
shutdown  condition,  without  generating  any  additional
hazard to personnel or the facility.
EXCEPTION  1:  An  EMO  circuit  is  not  needed  for
equipment rated 2.4 kVA or less, where the hazards are
only   electrical   in   nature,   provided   that   the   main
disconnect meets the accessibility provisions of Section
12. 5.2  and  that  the  effect  of  disconnecting  the  main
power   supply   is   equivalent   to   activating   an   EMO
circuit.
EXCEPTION 2: Assemblies that are not intended to be
used  as  stand-alone  equipment,  but  rather  within  an
overall  integrated  system,  and  that  receive  their  power
from  the  user’s  system,  are  not  required  to  have  an
emergency   off   circuit.   The   assembly’s   installation
manual   should   provide   clear   instructions   to   the
equipment  installer  to  connect  the  assembly  to  the
integrated system’s emergency off circuit.
NOTE 33:  It   is   recommended   that   the   emergency   off
function  not  reduce  the  effectiveness  of  safety  devices  or  of
devices with safety-related functions (e.g., magnetic chucks or
braking  devices)  necessary  to  bring  the  equipment  to  a  safe
shutdown condition effectively.
NOTE 34:  If   a   fire   detection   or   suppression   system   is
provided  with  the  equipment,  see  Section  14  for  additional
information.
12. 1.1  If   the   supplier   provides   an   external   EMO
interface on the equipment, the supplier should include
instructions for connecting to the interface.
12. 2  Activation  of  the  emergency  off  circuit  should
deenergize  all  hazardous  voltage  and  all  power  greater
than  240  volt-amps  in  the  equipment  beyond  the  main
power enclosure.
EXCEPTION 1: A non-hazardous voltage EMO circuit
(typically   24   volts)   and   its   supply   may   remain
energized.
EXCEPTION  2:  Safety  related  devices  (e.g.,  smoke
detectors,      gas/water      leak      detectors,      pressure
measurement devices, etc.) may remain energized from
a non-hazardous power source.
EXCEPTION   3:   A   computer   system   performing
data/alarm  logging  and  error  recovery  functions  may
remain    energized,    provided    that    the    energized
breaker(s),  receptacle(s),  and  each  energized  conductor
termination  are  clearly  labeled  as  remaining  energized
after  EMO  activation.  Hazardous  energized  parts  that
remain   energized   after   EMO   activation   should   be
insulated  or  guarded  to  prevent  inadvertent  contact  by
maintenance personnel.
EXCEPTION   4:   Multiple   units   mounted   separately
with  no  shared  hazards  and  without  interconnecting
circuits with hazardous voltages, energy levels or other
potentially hazardous conditions may have:
• separate sources of power and separate supply
circuit disconnect means if clearly identified, or
• separate  EMO  circuits,  if  they  are  clearly
identified.
12. 2.1  The  EMO  circuit  should  not  include  features
that are intended to allow it to be defeated or bypassed.
12. 2.2  The     EMO     circuit     should     consist     of
electromechanical components.
EXCEPTION  1:  Solid-state  devices  and  components
may  be  used,  provided  the  system  or  relevant  parts  of
the  system  are  evaluated  and  found  suitable  for  use.
The components should be evaluated and found suitable
considering  abnormal  conditions  such  as  over  voltage,
under voltage, power supply interruption, transient over
voltage,  ramp  voltage,  electromagnetic  susceptibility,
electrostatic discharge, thermal cycling, humidity, dust,
vibration  and  jarring.    The  final  removal  of  power
should be accomplished by means of electromechanical
components.
EXCEPTION 2: FECS may be used provided the FECS
conforms   to   an   appropriate   standard   for   electronic
safety  systems.    Components  of  the  FECS  should  be
tested and certified according to the requirements of the
standard  used.    IEC  61508  and  ISO  13849-1  (EN  954-
1) are examples of internationally recognized electronic
safety  systems  standards.    The  final  removal  of  power
should be accomplished by means of electromechanical
components.
NOTE 35:  Paragraph   13.4.3   states   additional   assessment
criteria for safety-related components and assemblies.
NOTE 36:  A FECS is a subsystem of a (PES) Programmable
Electronic  System.  IEC  61508  is  the  preferred  standard  for
complex PES.
12. 2.3  All EMO circuits should be fault-tolerant.
12. 2.4  Resetting   the   EMO   switch   should   not   re-
energize circuits, equipment, or subassemblies.
12. 2.5  The    EMO    circuit    should    shut    down    the
equipment   by   deenergizing   rather   than   energizing
control components.
12. 2.6  The    EMO    circuit    should    require    manual
resetting     so     that     power     cannot     be     restored
automatically.


SEMI S2-0703a

12. 3  The  emergency  off  button  should  be  red  and
mushroom  shaped.  A  yellow  background  for  the  EMO
should be provided.
NOTE 37:  Non-lockable  self-latching  (i.e.,  twist-  or  pull-to-
release) EMO buttons may be required by regulations.
12. 4  All   emergency   off   buttons   should   be   clearly
labeled as “EMO,” “Emergency Off,” or the equivalent
and should be clearly legible from the viewing location.
The  label  may  appear  on  the  button  or  on  the  yellow
background.
12. 5  Emergency    off    buttons    should    be    readily
accessible   from   operating   and   regularly   scheduled
maintenance locations and appropriately sized to enable
activation by the heel of the palm.
12. 5.1  Emergency  off  buttons  should  be  located  or
guarded to minimize accidental activation.
12. 5.2  No      operation      or      regularly      scheduled
maintenance location should require more than 3 m (10
feet) travel to an EMO button.
12. 5.3  The  person  actuating  or  inspecting  the  EMO
button should not be exposed to serious risks of tripping
or   falling   or   of   coming   in   contact   with   energized
electrical  parts,  moving  machinery,  surfaces  or  objects
operating   at   high   temperatures,   or   other   hazardous
equipment.
12. 6  See  Section  13.5  for  additional  EMO  guidelines
when EMOs are used with UPSs.
13  Electrical Design
13. 1  This   section   covers   electrical   and   electronic
equipment that use hazardous voltages.
13. 2  Types of Electrical Work — The following are the
four types of electrical work defined by this guideline:
Type 1 — Equipment is fully deenergized.
Type  2  —  Equipment  is  energized.  Energized  circuits
are covered or insulated.
NOTE 38:  Type  2  work  includes  tasks  where  the  energized
circuits  are  or  can  be  measured  by  placing  probes  through
suitable openings in the covers or insulators.
Type  3  —  Equipment  is  energized.  Energized  circuits
are  exposed  and  inadvertent  contact  with  uninsulated
energized  parts  is  possible.  Potential  exposures  are  no
greater than 30 volts rms, 42.4 volts peak, 60 volts dc or
240 volt-amps in dry locations.
Type  4  —  Equipment  is  energized.  Energized  circuits
are  exposed  and  inadvertent  contact  with  uninsulated
energized  parts  is  possible.  Potential  exposures  are
greater  than  30  volts  rms,  42.4  volts  peak,  60  volts  dc,
or  240  volt-amps  in  dry  locations.  Potential  exposures
to  radio-frequency  currents,  whether  induced  or  via
contact, exceed the limits in Table A5-1 of Appendix 5.
13. 3  Energized Electrical Work — The supplier should
design the equipment to minimize the need to calibrate,
modify,   repair,   test,   adjust,   or   maintain   equipment
while  it  is  energized,  and  to  minimize  work  that  must
be  performed  on  components  near  exposed  energized
circuits.  The  supplier  should  move  as  many  tasks  as
practical  from  category  Type  4  to  Types  1,  2,  or  3.
Routine   Type   4   tasks,   excluding   troubleshooting,
should    have    specific    written    instructions    in    the
maintenance manuals.  General safety procedures (e.g.,
wearing appropriate Personal Protective Equipment and
establishing   barriers)   for   troubleshooting,   including
Type 4 work, should be provided.
13. 4  Electrical  Design  —  Equipment  should  conform
to  the  appropriate  international,  regional,  national  or
industry product safety requirements.
13. 4.1  Nonconductive or grounded conductive physical
barriers should be provided:
• Where  it  is  necessary  to  reach  over,  under,  or
around, or in close proximity to hazards.
• Where   dropped   objects   could   cause   shorts   or
arcing.
• Where failure of liquid fittings from any part of the
equipment   would   result   in   the   introduction   of
liquid into electrical parts.
• Over the line side of the main disconnect.
• Where  maintenance  or  service  tasks  on  equipment
in  dry  locations  are  likely  to  allow  inadvertent
contact with uninsulated energized parts containing
either:  potentials  greater  than  30  volts  rms,  42.4
volts  peak,  or  60  volts  dc;  or  power  greater  than
240 volt-amps.
NOTE 39:  A dry location can be considered to be one that is
not normally subject to dampness or wetness.
NOTE 40:  Removable   nonconductive   and   noncombustible
covers are preferred.
13. 4.2  Where   test   probe   openings   are   provided   in
barriers,  the  barriers  should  be  located,  and  the  probe
openings should be sized, to prevent inadvertent contact
with  adjacent  energized  parts,  including  the  energized
parts of the test probes.
13. 4.3  Where  failure  of  components  and  assemblies
could result in a risk of electric shock, fire, or personal
injury,  those  components  and  assemblies  should  be
certified by an accredited testing laboratory and used in
accordance  with  the  manufacturer’s  specifications,  or
otherwise evaluated to the applicable standard(s).

NOTE 41:  With  the  exception  of  implementation  of  ground
fault  protection,  shunt  trip  units  that  require  power  to  trip
(actuate)  are  not  recommended  to  be  used  in  a  safety  control
circuit, because they are not fail-safe.
13. 4.4  Electrical   wiring   for   power   circuits,   control
circuits,  grounding  (earthing)  and  grounded  (neutral)
conductors    should    be    color    coded    according    to
appropriate  standard(s)  per  Section  13.4,  or  labeled  for
easy identification at both ends of the wire. Where color
is   used   for   identification,   it   is   acceptable   to   wrap
conductor   ends   with   appropriate   colored   tape   or
sleeving; the tape or sleeving should be reliably secured
to the conductor.
EXCEPTION    1:    Internal    wiring    on    individual
components,    e.g.,    motors,    transformers,    meters,
solenoid valves, power supplies.
EXCEPTION 2: Flexible cords.
EXCEPTION 3: Nonhazardous voltage multi-conductor
cables (e.g., ribbon cables).
EXCEPTION 4: When proper color is not available for
conductors designed for special application (e.g.,  high-
temperature conductors used for furnaces and ovens).
13. 4.5  Grounding (earthing) conductors and connectors
should  be  sized  to  be  compatible  in  current  rating  with
their  associated  ungrounded  conductors  according  to
appropriate standard(s) per Section 13.4.
13. 4.6  Electrical  enclosures  should  be  suitable  for  the
environment in which they are intended to be used.
13. 4.7  Enclosure  openings  should  safeguard  against
personnel  access  to  uninsulated  energized  parts.  (Refer
to  Appendix  1  for  examples  of  openings  for  protection
against access from operators.)
13. 4.8  Top  covers  of  electrical  enclosures  should  be
designed   and   constructed   to   prevent   objects   from
falling  into  the  enclosures.  (Refer  to  Appendix  1  for
examples of acceptable top enclosure openings.)
13. 4.9  The current interrupting capacity (also known as
amperes    interrupting    capacity,    or    AIC)    of    the
equipment  main  disconnect  should  be  identified  in  the
facility installation and maintenance manuals.
13. 4.10  The  equipment  should  be  provided  with  main
overcurrent  protection  devices  and  main  disconnect
devices   rated   for   at   least   10,000   rms   symmetrical
amperes interrupting capacity (AIC).
NOTE 42:  Some  facilities  may  require  higher  AIC  ratings
due to electrical distribution system design.
EXCEPTION:  Cord-  and  plug-connected  single  phase
equipment,  rated  no  greater  than  240  volts  line-to-
line/150  volts  line-to-ground  and  no  greater  than  2.4
kVA,  may  have  overcurrent  protection  devices  with
interrupting  capacity  of  at  least  5,000  rms  symmetrical
amperes interrupting capacity (AIC).
13. 4.11  Equipment   should   be   designed   to   receive
incoming  electrical  power  from  the  facility  to  a  single
feed  location  that  terminates  at  the  main  disconnect
specified   in   Section   13.4.9.   This   disconnect,   when
opened, should remove all incoming electrical power in
the equipment from the load side of the disconnect. The
disconnect   should   also   have   the   energy   isolation
(“lockout”) capabilities specified in Section 17.
EXCEPTION  1:  Equipment  with  more  than  one  feed
should be provided with provisions for energy isolation
(lockout)   for   each   feed   and   be   marked   with   the
following  text  or  the  equivalent  at  each  disconnect:
“WARNING:    Risk    of    Electric    Shock    or    Burn.
Disconnect  all  [number  of  feed  locations]  sources  of
supply prior to servicing.” It is preferred that all of the
disconnects   for   the   equipment   be   grouped   in   one
location.
EXCEPTION   2:   Multiple   units   mounted   separately
with  no  shared  hazards  and  without  interconnecting
circuits with hazardous voltages, energy levels or other
potentially hazardous conditions may have:
• separate  sources  of  power  and  separate  supply
circuit   disconnect   means,   if   they   are   clearly
identified; or
• separate    EMO    circuits,    if    they    are    clearly
identified.
13. 4.12  A      permanent      nameplate      listing      the
manufacturer’s  name,  machine  serial  number,  supply
voltage,  phase,  frequency  and  full-load  current  should
be attached to the equipment where plainly visible after
installation.  Where  more  than  one  incoming  supply
circuit is to be provided, the nameplate should state the
above information for each circuit.
NOTE 43:      Additional    nameplate    information    may    be
required depending on the location of use.
13. 5  Uninterruptable  Power  Supplies  (UPSs)  —  This
section  applies  to  UPSs  with  outputs  greater  than:  30
volts  rms,  42.4  volts  peak;  60  volts  dc;  or  240  volt-
amps.
13. 5.1  Whenever    a    UPS    is    provided    with    the
equipment,  its  location  and  wiring  should  be  clearly
described   within   the   installation   and   maintenance
manual.
13. 5.2  Power from the UPS should be interrupted
when
any of the following events occur:
• the emergency off actuator (button) is pushed; or
• the main equipment disconnect is opened; or


SEMI S2-0703a
E
© SEMI 1991, 2004 16
• the main circuit breaker is opened.
EXCEPTION:  Upon  EMO  activation,  the  UPS  may
supply   power   to   the   EMO   circuit,   safety   related
devices,  and  data/alarm  logging  computer  systems  as
described in the exception clauses of Section 12.2.
13. 5.3  The  UPS  may  be  physically  located  within  the
footprint  of  the  equipment  provided  that  the  UPS  is
within its own enclosure and is clearly identified.
13. 5.4  The  UPS  should  be  certified  by  an  accredited
testing   laboratory   and   be   suitable   for   its   intended
environment    (e.g.,    damp    location,    exposure    to
corrosives).
13. 5.5  The  UPS  wiring  should  be  identified  as  “UPS
Supply Output” or equivalent at each termination point
where the UPS wiring can be disconnected.
13. 6  Electrical Safety Tests
13. 6.1  Equipment   connected   to   the   facility   branch
circuit  with  a  cord  and  plug  should  not  exhibit  surface
leakage  current  greater  than  3.5  milliampere  (mA)  as
determined  by  testing  completed  in  accordance  with
“Leakage  Current  Test  for  Plug-and-Cord  Equipment”
in SEMI S9.
EXCEPTION:     Equipment     with     leakage     current
exceeding  3.5  mA  is  acceptable  if  documentation  is
provided  to  substantiate  that  the  equipment  is  fully
compliant  with  an  applicable  product  safety  standard
that explicitly permits a higher leakage current.
13. 6.2  Equipment  grounding  circuits  should  have  a
measured  resistance  of  one-tenth  (0.1)  ohm  or  less  as
determined by testing in accordance with SEMI S9.
13. 7  Equipment  in  which  flammable  liquids  or  gases
are  used  should  be  assessed  to  determine  if  additional
precautions  (e.g.,  purging)  in  the  electrical  design  are
necessary.
NOTE 44:  NFPA  497  and  EN  1127-1  provide  methods  for
making this assessment.
14  Fire Protection
14. 1  Overview  —  This  section  applies  to  fire  hazards
that are internal to the equipment.
14. 1.1  This     section     provides     minimum     safety
considerations  for  fire  protection  designs  and  controls
on the equipment.
14. 1.2  This      section      also      provides      minimum
considerations   for   fire   detection   and   suppression
systems when provided with the equipment.
NOTE 45:  Detailed  guidance  on  fire  risk  assessment  and
mitigation  for  semiconductor  manufacturing  equipment  is
provided in SEMI S14.
14. 2  Risk Assessment
14. 2.1  A   documented   risk   assessment   should   be
performed
or accepted by a party qualified to determine
and  evaluate  fire  hazards  and  the  potential  need  for
controls.  The  risk  assessment  should  consider  normal
operations   and   reasonably   foreseeable   single-point
failures  within  the  equipment.  It  should  not  consider
exposure  to  fire  or  external  ignition  sources  not  within
the specified use environment.
NOTE 46:  This  risk  assessment  can  be  combined  with  the
overall hazard analysis performed for this guideline, provided
the  risk  assessor  has  the  required  professional  expertise  to
perform risk assessments for fire hazards. SEMI S7 describes
qualifications for such an assessor.
14. 2.2  If  an  accurate  risk  assessment  depends  on  the
user’s  adherence  to  specified  procedures  or  conditions
of  use,  the  supplier  should  describe  such  procedures  or
conditions and state their importance.
14. 2.3  SEMI  S14  should  be  used  to  assess  and  report
risks to property and the environment.
14. 3  Reporting
14. 3.1  A  summary  report  should  be  provided  to  the
user.   The   summary
should   include   the   following
characterizations,  per  SEMI  S10,  for  each  residual
fire
hazard identified:
• the assigned Severity;
• the assigned Likelihood; and
• the resulting Risk Category.
14. 3.2  Optional  fire  risk  reduction  features  should  be
described  in  the  pre-purchase  information  provided  to
the user.
14. 3.3  The scope and effectiveness of the means of fire
risk  reduction  should  also  be  identified  and  reported,
including  the  expected  risk  reduction  (as  described  in
Section 14.3.1).
14. 3.4  If,  due  to  fire  hazards  within  the  equipment,
thermal   or   non-thermal   (e.g.,   smoke)   damage   is
possible  outside  of  the  equipment,  then  this  possibility
should  be  reported  to  the  user.  This  report  should
include   a   qualitative   description   of   the   foreseen
scenario.
14. 4  Fire Risk Reduction
14. 4.1  Materials of Construction — Equipment should
be  constructed  of  noncombustible  materials  wherever
reasonable.  If  process  chemicals  do  not  permit  the  use
of  noncombustible  construction,  then  the  equipment
should be constructed of materials, suitable for the uses
and  compatible  with  the  process  chemicals  used,  that
contribute least to the fire risk.


SEMI S2-0703a
E
© SEMI 1991, 2004 17
NOTE 47:  Some  regional  codes  (e.g.,  Uniform  Fire  Code)
may require construction with noncombustible materials.
14. 4.1.1  The flowchart in Appendix 6 may be used for
the selection of materials of construction for equipment.
14. 4.1.2  Any portion of equipment that falls within the
scope  of  SEMI  F14  (Guide  for  the  Design  of  Gas
Source  Equipment  Enclosures)  should  be  designed  in
accordance with that guide.
14. 4.2  Elimination  of  Process  Chemical  Hazards  —
The   option   of   substituting   non-flammable   process
chemicals  for  flammable  process  chemicals  should  be
considered.
14. 4.3  Engineering Controls
14. 4.3.1  Fire  risks  resulting  from  process  chemicals
may   be   reduced   using   engineering   controls   (e.g.,
preventing    improper    chemical    mixing,    preventing
temperatures from reaching the flash point).
14. 4.3.2  Fire    risks    resulting    from    materials    of
construction may be reduced using engineering controls
(e.g.,      non-combustible      barriers      that      separate
combustible  materials  of  construction  from  ignition
sources,   installing   a   fire   suppression   system   that
extinguishes ignited materials).
14. 4.3.3  Equipment  power  and  chemical  sources  that
present  unacceptable  fire  risks  should  be  interlocked
with  the  fire  detection  and  suppression  systems  to
prevent   start-up   of   the   equipment   or   delivery   of
chemicals  when  the  fire  detection  or  suppression  is
inactive.
NOTE 48:  Some jurisdictions require interlocking.
NOTE 49:  Refer to Section 6.5 for criteria for acceptability.
14. 4.3.4  Shutdown  or  failure  of  a  fire  detection  or
suppression system need not interrupt the processing of
product  within  the  equipment  by  immediately  shutting
down  the  equipment,  but  should  prevent  additional
processing  until  the  fire  detection  or  suppression  is
restored.  Software  or  hardware  may  be  used  for  this
function.
14. 4.3.5  Controlling smoke by exhausting it (using the
supplier-specified     equipment     exhaust)     from     the
cleanroom  may  be  used  to  reduce  fire  risks  from  the
generation  of  products  of  combustion.  When  used,  this
reduction method should be combined with detection or
suppression when flames can be propagated.
NOTE 50:  Controlling smoke may be sufficient when smoke
is  the  only  consequence  (e.g.,  smoldering  components  that
generate smoke).
NOTE 51:  For  controlling  smoke  to  be  effective,  the  smoke
must be removed not only from the equipment, but also from
the cleanroom. This is typically accomplished by using ducted
exhaust.
NOTE 52:  The  use  of  exhaust  to  remove  smoke  may  be
subject to regulations, such as building and fire codes.
NOTE 53:  The  use  of  exhaust  to  remove  smoke  may  create
hazards within the exhaust system. Therefore, a description of
the   expected   discharge   (i.e.,   anticipated   air   flow   rate,
temperature,  and  rate  of  smoke  generation)  into  the  exhaust
system   may   be   important   information   for   installation   of
equipment.
14. 4.4  Fire  Detection  —  The  following  criteria  apply
to    any    fire    detection    system    determined    to    be
appropriate    for    fire    protection    by    the    fire    risk
assessment:
NOTE 54:  Heat  detectors,  smoke  sensing  devices,  and  other
devices  used  solely  for  monitoring  equipment  status  may  not
need  to  meet  these  requirements.  Some  local  jurisdictions,
however, may require that all smoke detectors be connected to
building  systems  and  be  compliant  with  all  applicable  fire
alarm codes.
14. 4.4.1  The   fire   detection   system,   which   includes
detectors,  alarms  and  their  associated  controls,  should
be  certified  by  an  accredited  testing  laboratory  and
suitable  for  the  application  and  for  the  environment  in
which it is to be used.
NOTE 55:  Such   certifications   typically   require   that   the
components  of  fire  detection  systems  are  readily  identifiable
and distinguishable from other components in the equipment.
14. 4.4.2  The  fire  detection,  alarm  and  control  system
should be installed in accordance with the requirements
of    the    certification    in    Section    14.4.4.1,    and    in
accordance   with   requirements   of   the   appropriate
international or national codes or standards (e.g., NFPA
72).
14. 4.4.3  The fire detection system should be capable of
interfacing  with  the  facility’s  alarm  system.  It  may  be
preferable  for  the  equipment  supplier  to  specify  the
location  and  performance  of  detectors,  but  not  provide
them, so that the user may better integrate the detection
in   the   equipment   with   that   in   the   facility.   This
alternative should be negotiated explicitly with the user.
14. 4.4.4  The   fire   detection   system   should   activate
alarms audibly and visually at the equipment.
14. 4.4.5  Manual   activation   capability   for   the   fire
detection  system  should  be  considered,  for  the  purpose
of   providing   notification   to   a   constantly   attended
location.
14. 4.4.6  Activation     of     trouble     or     supervisory
conditions should result in all of the following:
• notification of the operator;


SEMI S2-0703a
E
© SEMI 1991, 2004 18
• allowing the completion of processing of substrates
in the equipment;
• prevention  of  processing  of  additional  substrates
until   the   trouble   or   supervisory   condition   is
cleared; and
• providing, through an external interface, a signal to
the   facility   monitoring   system   or   a   constantly
attended location.
NOTE 56:  Some  local  jurisdictions  require  that  such  alarms
signal the building/facility fire alarm systems.
14. 4.4.7  The fire detection system should be capable of
operating at all times, including when the equipment is
inoperable  (e.g.,  equipment  controller  problems)  or  in
maintenance    modes    (e.g.,    some    or    all    of    the
equipment’s  hazardous  energies  are  isolated  (“locked
out”).    For  the  purpose  of  this  section,  “inoperable”
includes the equipment states after an EMO is activated
and  after  the  equipment  has  had  its  hazardous  energies
isolated  (i.e.,  has  been  “locked  out”).    Therefore,  the
detection system should not require hazardous voltages
(e.g.,  line  alternating  current)  to operate anything other
than   the   equipment   within   the   detection   system’s
control  enclosure.    Sensors  and  other  devices  outside
the  detection  system’s  control  enclosure  should  not
require hazardous voltage.
EXCEPTION:   Operability   is   not   required   during
maintenance of the fire detection system.
14. 4.4.7.1  Power   at   a   hazardous   voltage   may   be
supplied  to  the  detection  system  controller  enclosure
after  the  equipment  EMO  is  activated  or  after  the
equipment has had its hazardous energies isolated only
if   the   wiring   providing   the   hazardous   voltage   is
separated from other wiring and is suitably labeled.
14. 4.4.7.2  If   the   hazardous   voltage   supply   to   the
detection  system  controller  is  not  disconnected  by  the
energy   isolation   method   that   removes   the   other
hazardous voltages from the equipment, there must also
be  separate  hazardous  energy  isolation  capability  for
the  hazardous  voltage  supplies  to  the  detection  system
controller enclosure.
14. 4.4.8  A    battery    or    other    regulatory    agency
acceptable  emergency  power  alternative,  capable  of
sustaining the detection system for 24 hours, should be
provided.
NOTE 57:  Back-up  power  must  be  provided  in  accordance
with  local  regulations.  The  requirements  for  back-up  power
vary among jurisdictions.
14. 4.4.9  The fire detection system should remain active
following EMO activation.
14. 4.4.10  There may be cases where the internal power
supply  for  a  detection  system  cannot  supply  power  for
the  full  length  of  extended  maintenance  procedures
(i.e.,  procedures  longer  than  the  expected  duration  of
the  back-up  power  supply).  In  such  cases,  the  supplier
should  provide  written  procedures  for  either  removing
the  fire  hazard  or  safely  supplying  power  to  the  fire
detection system.
14. 4.4.11  Activation   of   the   fire   detection   system
should  shut  down  the  equipment  within  the  shortest
time  period  that  allows  for  safe  equipment  shutdown.
This   includes   shutdown   of   any   fire-related   hazard
source  that  could  create  additional  fire  risks  for  the
affected module or component.
NOTE 58:  See  Sections  14.4.3.3  and    14.4.3.4  for  related
provisions.
EXCEPTION   1:   A non-recycling,   deadman   abort
switch is acceptable on detection systems that are used
for  equipment  shutdown,  but  not  on  those  used  for
activation of a suppression system.
EXCEPTION 2: Activation of the fire detection system
should not remove power from fire and safety systems.
14. 4.4.12  The   equipment   design   and   configuration
should  not  prevent  licensed  parties  from  certifying  the
design and installation of fire detection systems.
NOTE 59:  This   is   not   meant   to   suggest   installation   by
licensed   parties;   however,   some   jurisdictions   require   fire
detection  and  suppression  system  installers  to  be  licensed  as
specified by the jurisdiction.
14. 4.5  Fire   Suppression   —   The   following   criteria
apply  to  any  fire  suppression  system  determined  to  be
appropriate by the fire risk assessment.
NOTE 60:  As a fire detection system is generally required to
provide  the  initiating  sequence  for  the  suppression  system,  it
is  the  intention  of  this  guideline  that  this  be  the  same  fire
detection system described in Section 14.4.4.
14. 4.5.1  The  fire  suppression  system,  which  includes
nozzles, actuators, and their associated controls, should
be  certified  by  an  accredited  testing  laboratory  and
suitable  for  the  application  and  for  the  environment  in
which it to be used.
NOTE 61:  Such   certifications   typically   require   that   the
components    of    fire    suppression    systems    are    readily
identifiable and distinguishable from other components in the
equipment. This includes adequate labeling of piping.
14. 4.5.2  The fire suppression agent should be accepted
for  the  application  by  an  accredited  testing  laboratory.
The suppression agent selection process should include
an evaluation of the amount and storage location of the
suppression   agent   and   of   potential   damage   to   a
cleanroom  and  the  environment.  The  least  damaging
effective  agent  should  be  selected.  If  more  than  one


SEMI S2-0703a
E
© SEMI 1991, 2004 19
agent is effective, the options should be specified to the
user so that the user may specify which agent should be
provided  with  the  equipment.  The  supplier  should  also
specify if the user may provide the agent.
14. 4.5.3  The   fire   suppression   agent   and   delivery
system  should  be  designed  and  installed  in  accordance
with  the  appropriate  international  or  national  standard
(e.g.,  NFPA  12,  NFPA  13,  NFPA  2001).  It  may  be
preferable  for  the  equipment  supplier  to  specify  the
location    and    performance    of    suppression    system
components, but not provide them, so that the user may
better  integrate  the  suppression  in  the  equipment  with
that in the facility. This alternative should be negotiated
explicitly with the user.
14. 4.5.4  The assessment of the equipment to SEMI S2
should include the risks associated with the suppression
systems.
NOTE 62:  This   includes   risks   (e.g.,   chemical   exposure,
noise,  and  asphyxiation)  introduced  by  the  incorporation  of
the suppression system.
14. 4.5.5  Activation   of   the   fire   suppression   system
should  alarm  audibly  and  visually  at  the  equipment.
This  may  be  done  by  the  same  system  that  initiates
activation.
14. 4.5.6  If  the  discharge  is  likely  to  present  a  risk  to
personnel,  the  alarm  should  provide  adequate  time  to
allow   personnel   to   avoid   the   hazard   of   the   agent
discharge.
14. 4.5.6.1  If there is a confined space in the equipment,
the   asphyxiation   hazard   posed   by   the   suppression
system should be assessed.
14. 4.5.7  The fire suppression system should be capable
of  operating  at  all  times,  including  when  equipment  is
inoperable and during equipment maintenance.
NOTE 63:  For   the   purpose   of   this   section,   “inoperable”
includes the equipment state after the EMO is activated.
EXCEPTION:    Most    suppression    systems    contain
sources  of  hazardous  energy.  These  sources  should  be
capable  of  being  isolated  (i.e.,  “locked  out”)  to  protect
personnel.
14. 4.5.8  The  fire  suppression  system  should  remain
active following EMO activation.
14. 4.5.9  There  may  be  cases  where  the  internal  power
supply  for  a  suppression  system  cannot  supply  power
for  the  full  length  of  extended  maintenance  procedures
(i.e.,  procedures  longer  than  the  expected  duration  of
the  back-up  power  supply).  In  such  cases,  the  supplier
should  provide  written  procedures  for  either  removing
the  fire  hazard  or  safely  supplying  power  to  the  fire
suppression system.
14. 4.5.10  Allowances  can  be  made  to  provide  for  the
deactivation    of    an    automatic    discharge    of    the
suppression  system  when  in  the  maintenance  mode.
Such deactivation switches should be supervised (i.e., if
the  suppression  system  is  deactivated,  there  should  be
an   indication   to   the   user   and   the   resumption   of
production in the equipment should be prevented.)
NOTE 64:  Hazardous   energies   associated   with   the   fire
suppression  system  may  be  isolated  (i.e.,  “locked  out”)  using
an   energy   isolation   procedure   (see   Section   17)   during
equipment maintenance.
NOTE 65:  The  permissibility  of  deactivation  of  suppression
systems varies among jurisdictions.
14. 4.5.11  A    back-up    power    supply,    capable    of
sustaining  the  suppression  system  for  24  hours,  should
be  included  where  the  suppression  system  requires
independent  power  from  the  detection  system  used  to
activate the suppression.
NOTE 66:  The  requirements  for  back-up  power  vary  among
jurisdictions.
14. 4.5.12  The   fire   suppression   system   should   be
capable  of  interfacing  with  the  facility’s  alarm  system.
This may be done via the fire detection system.
14. 4.5.13  Activation  of  the  fire  suppression  system
should  shut  down  the  equipment  within  the  shortest
time period that allows for safe equipment shutdown.
NOTE 67:  See  Sections  14.4.3.3  and  14.4.3.4  for  related
provisions.
EXCEPTION: Activation of the fire suppression system
should not remove power from fire and safety systems.
14. 4.5.14  The   fire   suppression   system   should   be
capable  of  manual  activation,  which  should  shut  down
the  equipment  and  activate  an  alarm  signal  locally  and
at a constantly attended location.
14. 4.5.15  The fire suppression system should be tested
on  a  representative  sample  of  the  equipment.  The  test
procedure should include a suppression agent discharge
test,   unless   precluded   for   health   or   environmental
reasons.  This  test  may  be  performed  at  the  equipment
supplier’s   or   other   similar   facility,   but   should   be
performed  under  conditions  that  adequately  duplicate
any  factors  (e.g.,  equipment  exhaust)  that  may  reduce
the effectiveness of the suppression. This representative
sample   need   not   be   fully   operational,   but   should
duplicate  those  factors  (e.g.,  exhaust,  air  flow)  that
could negatively affect the performance of the system.
14. 4.5.16  Procedures   for   controlling   access   to   the
suppression    agent    source    (e.g.,    protecting    agent
cylinders     from     disconnection     by     unauthorized
personnel) should be provided.


SEMI S2-0703a

14. 4.5.17  The   equipment   design   and   configuration
should  not  prevent  licensed  parties  from  certifying  the
design and installation of fire suppression systems.
NOTE 68:  This   is   not   meant   to   suggest   installation   by
licensed   parties;   however,   some   jurisdictions   require   fire
detection  and  suppression  system  installers  to  be  licensed  as
specified by the jurisdiction.
14. 4.5.18  Installation  of  Piping  for  Fire  Suppression
Agent — The fire suppression piping system should be:
• made from corrosion-resistant components,
• designed  to  minimize  water  accumulation  around
components   and   control   other   conditions   that
promote corrosion, and
• designed   so   mechanical   inspections   are   easily
performed.
14. 4.5.19  Piping   should   be   designed,   installed,   and
tested to ensure that it is capable of containing the high
pressures generated by the discharge of the suppression
agent.
14. 4.5.20  The   supplier   should   provide   information
necessary for proper field installation of piping.
14. 5  Warnings  and  Safe  Work  Practices  —  Warnings
and  safe  work  practices  related  to  fire  detection  and
suppression features of the equipment (e.g., restrictions
on   using   open   flames   within   range   of   active   fire
detection    systems,    hazardous    stored    energy    in
pressurized  suppression  systems)  should  be  part  of  the
documentation provided by the supplier.
14. 6  Maintenance  and  Testing  of  Fire  Detection  and
Suppression Systems — The equipment supplier should
provide detailed maintenance and testing procedures for
the fire systems provided with each piece of equipment.
These  procedures  should  include  testing  frequency,  as
well as details of special equipment required for testing.
14. 6.1  Chemical generating test apparatus (e.g., canned
smoke) should be avoided for cleanroom applications.
NOTE 69:  Information about UV/IR generating sources used
for testing fire detection systems may require consideration of
Section 25 (Non-Ionizing Radiation).
14. 6.2  The    maintenance    testing    procedure    should
include  testing  of  the  facility  interface  and  verifying
that  all  the  equipment  fire  detection  and  suppression
systems are functional.
14. 6.3  The  detection  and  suppression  systems  should
be   designed   so   that   preventative   maintenance   of
components  does  not  degrade  their  performance  (e.g.,
by resulting in displacement or destruction of sensors).
14. 6.4  Supplier  should  document  the  sound  pressure
level  generated  during  suppression  agent  discharge,  if
the test is performed.
14. 6.5  Materials  or  procedures  used  for  testing  and
maintenance   of   the   fire   detection   and   suppression
system  should  not  degrade  the  equipment’s  ability  to
perform its intended function.
14. 6.6  Suppliers  should  describe  hazardous  energies
present  in  fire  detection  and  suppression  systems,  and
provide   instructions   for   their   proper   isolation   (see
Section 17.2).
14. 7  Environmental    —    Suppliers    should    provide
guidance to users regarding the impact on emissions of
any fire suppression agents used in the equipment.
15  Heated Chemical Baths
15. 1  Refer to SEMI S3 for the minimum safety design
considerations  for  heated  chemical  baths.  Each  heated
chemical bath should have the following:
• grounded or GFCI-protected heater;
• power interrupt;
• manual reset;
• automatic temperature controller;
• liquid level sensor;
• fail-safe over-temperature protection;
• proper construction materials;
• exhaust failure interlock; and
• overcurrent protection.
NOTE 70:   See Section 14 for fire protection risk assessment
considerations   for   baths   using   combustible   or   flammable
chemicals.
16  Ergonomics and Human Factors
16. 1  General — Ergonomics and human factors design
principles should be incorporated into the development
of  equipment  to  identify  and  eliminate  or  mitigate
ergonomics- and human factors-related hazards.
16. 2  Provisions for Conformance — Equipment should
be assessed to the guidelines set forth in SEMI S8. The
Supplier Ergonomic Success Criteria (SESC; see SEMI
S8),  or  the  equivalent,  should  be  used  to  document  the
assessment.

17  Hazardous Energy Isolation
17. 1  General
17. 1.1  Lockable energy isolation capabilities should be
provided  for  tasks  that  may  result  in  contact  with
hazardous energy sources.
17. 1.2  Where service tasks may be safely performed on
subassemblies,  energy  isolation  devices  (e.g.,  circuit
breakers,  disconnect  switches,  manual  valves)  may  be
provided for the subassemblies for use as an alternative
to  shutting  down  the  entire  equipment  system.  The
isolation devices should isolate all hazardous energy to
the subassemblies and be capable of being locked in the
position in which the hazardous energy is isolated.
17. 1.3  The  person  actuating  or  inspecting  an  energy
isolating  device  should  not  be  exposed  to  serious  risks
of  tripping  or  falling  or  of  coming  in  contact  with
energized  electrical  parts,  moving  machinery,  surfaces
or  objects  operating  at  high  temperatures,  or  other
hazardous equipment.
NOTE 71:  Hazardous   energies   include   electrical,   stored
electrical       (e.g.,       capacitors,       batteries),       chemical,
thermal/cryogenic,     stored     pressure     (e.g.,     pressurized
containers),   suspended   weight,   stored   mechanical   (e.g.,
springs), generated pressure (e.g., hydraulics and pneumatics),
and other sources that may lead to the risk of injury.
NOTE 72:  In order to minimize down-time and provide ease
of use, it is preferred to have energy isolation devices located
in the areas where maintenance or service is performed.
NOTE 73:  Energy     isolation     devices     for     incompatible
hazardous    energy    sources    (e.g.,    electrical    and    water,
incompatible gases) are recommended to be separated.
NOTE 74:  Isolation   of   hazardous   energy   may   include:
deenergizing    of    hazardous    voltage;    stopping    flow    of
hazardous   production   material   (HPM);   containing   HPM
reservoirs;  depressurizing  or  containing  HPM  and  pneumatic
lines;  deenergizing  or  totally  containing  hazardous  radiation;
discharging  of    residual  energy  in  capacitors;  stopping  of
hazardous    moving    parts;    and    shutting    off    hazardous
temperature sources.
NOTE 75:  Energy  isolation  devices  with  integral  locking
capabilities   are   preferred,   but   may   not   be   feasible   or
commercially  available,  in  which  case  detachable  lockout
adapters may be used.
NOTE 76:  See  Section  14  for  information  on  fire  protection
hazardous energies.
17. 2  Installation and Maintenance Manuals
17. 2.1  Installation  and  maintenance  manuals  should
identify  the  types  of  hazardous  energies  within  the
equipment.
17. 2.2  Installation  and  maintenance  manuals  should
provide  specific  instructions  for  the  equipment  on  how
to:
• shut down the equipment in an orderly manner;
• locate   and   operate   all   the   equipment's   energy
isolating devices;
• affix energy isolating (“lockout/tagout”) devices;
• relieve any stored energies;
• verify that the equipment has actually been isolated
and deenergized; and
• properly  release  the  equipment  from  its  isolated
state.
17. 2.3  Where    the    manufacturer    provides    written
maintenance procedures for tasks within subassemblies,
and   intends   that   these   tasks   be   performed   without
controlling  hazardous  energies  at  the  entire  equipment
level,  the  installation  and  maintenance  manuals  should
provide  appropriate  energy  isolation  procedures  at  the
subassembly level.
17. 3  Electrical Energy Isolation
17. 3.1  The     main     energy     isolation     capabilities
(equipment  supply  disconnect)  should  be  in  a  location
that is readily accessible and should be lockable only in
the deenergized position.
NOTE 77:  For  equipment  with  multiple  incoming  supply
sources,  it  is  recommended  that  all  of  the  energy  isolation
devices be located in one area.
17. 4  Non-Electrical Energy Isolation
17. 4.1  The  equipment  should  include  provisions  and
procedures  so  that  hazardous  energy  sources,  such  as
pressurized  systems  and  stored  energy,  can  be  isolated
or  reduced  to  a  zero  energy  state  prior  to  maintenance
or service work.
17. 4.2  The  hazardous  energy  isolation  devices  should
be in a location that is readily accessible.
17. 4.3  The  hazardous  energy  isolation  devices  should
be capable of being locked in the position in which the
hazardous energy is isolated.
18  Mechanical Design
18. 1  This section covers hazards due to the mechanical
aspects of the equipment.
NOTE 78:  This  is  similar  to  the  essential  requirements  of
European  Union  directives.  The  supplier  has  the  option  of
demonstrating  compliance  by  choosing  standards  that  are
appropriate to the machine and application.
NOTE 79:  Pressurized  vessels  must  meet  applicable  codes
and regulations.
18. 2  Machine   Stability   —   Equipment,   components,
and fittings should be designed and constructed so that
they  are  stable  under  reasonably  foreseeable  shipping,


SEMI S2-0703a
E

installation,  and  operating  conditions.  The  need  for
special   handling   devices   and   anchors   should   be
indicated  in  the  instructions.  Unanchored  equipment  in
its  installed  condition  should  not  overbalance  when
tilted in any direction to an angle of 10 degrees from its
normal position.
NOTE 80:  See IEC 61010-1 for an example of stability tests.
18. 3  Break-up  During  Operation  —  The  various  parts
of  the  equipment  and  its  linkages  should  be  able  to
withstand the stresses to which they are subjected when
used   as   designed.   Precautions   should   be   taken   to
control risks from falling or flying objects.
18. 3.1  The    potential    effects    of    fatigue,    aging,
corrosion,   and   abrasion   for   the   intended   operating
environment   should   be   considered   as   part   of   the
mechanical hazards risk assessment.
18. 3.2  Where   a   risk   of   rupture   or   disintegration
remains  despite  the  measures  taken  (e.g.,  a  substrate
chuck  that  loses  its  vacuum),  the  moving  parts  should
be  mounted  and  positioned  in  such  a  way  that,  in  case
of rupture, their fragments will be contained.
18. 3.3  Both rigid and flexible pipes carrying liquids or
gases  should  be  able  to  withstand  the  foreseen  internal
and  external  stresses  and  should  be  firmly  attached  or
protected against external stresses and strains. Based on
the  application,  an  appropriate  factor  of  safety  should
be included.
18. 4  Moving  Parts  —  The  moving  parts  of  equipment
should   be   designed,   built,   and   positioned   to   avoid
hazards.  Where  hazards  persist,  equipment  should  be
fitted  with  guards  or  protective  devices  that  reduce  the
likelihood of contact that could lead to injury.
18. 4.1  Where   the   machine   is   designed   to   perform
operations   under   different   conditions   of   use   (e.g.,
different   speeds   or   energy   supplies),   it   should   be
designed  and  constructed  in  such  a  way  that  selection
and  adjustment  of  these  conditions  can  be  performed
safely.
18. 4.2  Selection of Protection Against Hazards Related
to  Moving  Parts  —  Guards  or  protective  devices  used
to   protect   against   hazards   related   to   moving   parts
should be selected on the basis of a risk assessment that
includes the:
• hazards that are being guarded against;
• probability  of  occurrence  and  severity  of  injury  of
each hazard scenario; and
• frequency of removal of guards.
18. 4.3  Guards and protection devices. Guards should:
• reduce  the  risk  that  personnel  will  contact  the
mechanical hazard to an acceptable level; and
• not give rise to additional risk.
18. 5  Lifting    Operations   —   Equipment   presenting
hazards  due  to  lifting  operations  (e.g.,  falling  loads,
collisions,  tipping)  should  be  designed  and  constructed
to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
18. 6  Extreme   Temperatures   —   Surfaces   that   are
accessible   to   personnel,   and   that   are   at   high   (per
temperature limits in Table 1) or very cold temperatures
(below  -10°C  [14°F]),  should  be  fitted  with  guards  or
designed out.
18. 6.1  Where it is not feasible to protect or design out
the  exposures  to  extreme  temperature,  temperatures
exceeding  the  limits  are  permitted,  provided  that  either
of the following conditions is met:
• unintentional   contact   with   such   a   surface   is
unlikely; or
•
the part has a warning indicating that the surface is
at a hazardous temperature.

19  Seismic Protection
NOTE 81:  Users  have  facilities  located  in  areas  that  are
susceptible to seismic activity. The end user may require more
stringent design criteria because of increased site vulnerability
(e.g.,  local  soil  conditions  and  building  design  may  produce
significantly    higher    accelerations)    and    local    regulatory
requirements.  Certified  drawings  and  calculations  may  be
required in some jurisdictions.
19. 1  General  —  The  equipment  should  be  designed  to
control   the   risk   of   injury   to   personnel,   adverse
environmental  impact,  equipment  and  facility  damage
due to movement, overturning, or leakage of chemicals
(including  liquid  splashing),  during  a  seismic  event.
The  design  should  also  control  equipment  damage  due
to  failure  of  fragile  parts  (e.g.,  quartzware,  ceramics)
during a seismic event.
NOTE 82:  These  criteria  are  intended  to  accomplish  two
things:
(1) allow   equipment   suppliers   to   correctly   design   the
internal  frame  and  components  to  withstand  seismic  forces;
and
(2) allow equipment designers to provide end-users with the
information  needed  to  appropriately  secure  the  equipment
within their facility.
19. 1.1  Because  preventing  all  damage  to  equipment
may   be   impractical,   the   design   should   control   the
failure of parts that may result in increased hazard (e.g.,
hazardous materials release, fire, projectile).
NOTE 83:  It   is   recommended   that   the   hazard   analysis
described  in  Section  6.8  be  used  to  evaluate  both  the  risk  of
part failure and the effectiveness of control measures.
19. 1.1.1  These    parts    should    be    accessible    for
evaluation of damage.
NOTE 84:  SEMI  S8  contains  guidelines  for  maintainability
and    serviceability;    these    may    be    used    to    determine
accessibility.
19. 2  Design  Loads  —  The  equipment,  subassemblies,
and   all   devices   used   for   anchoring   the   equipment
should be designed as follows:
19. 2.1  For equipment containing hazardous production
materials (HPMs), the equipment should be designed to
withstand a horizontal loading of 94% of the weight of
the  equipment,  acting  at  the  equipment’s  center  of
mass.
19. 2.2  For    equipment    not    containing    hazardous
production  materials  (HPMs),  the  equipment  should  be
designed  to  withstand  a  horizontal  loading  of  63%  of
the  weight  of  the  equipment,  acting  at  the  equipment’s
center of mass.
NOTE 85:  Subassemblies  may  include  transformers,  vessels,
power  supplies,  vacuum  pumps,  monitors,  fire  suppression
components,   or   other   items   of   substantial   mass   that   are
attached to the equipment.
19. 2.3  Horizontal     loads     should     be     calculated
independently  on  each  of  the  X  and  Y axes,  or  on  the
axis  that  produces  the  largest  loads  on  the  anchorage
points.
19. 2.4  When  calculating  for  overturning,  a  maximum
value of 85% of the weight of the equipment should be
used to resist the overturning moment.
NOTE 86:  Because  equipment  may  be  placed  into  service
anywhere  in  the  world,  it  is  recommended  that  the  seismic
protection    design    of    the    equipment    be    based    upon
requirements  that  allow  the  equipment,  as  designed,  to  be
installed  in  most  sites  worldwide.  The  above  loads  are  based
on  1997  Uniform  Building  Code  (UBC)  requirements  for
rigid equipment in Seismic Zone 4, and are assumed to satisfy
most design situations worldwide.
NOTE 87:  If the equipment or internal component is flexible
as defined by the UBC, is located above the midheight of the
building,  or  is  within  5  km  of  a  major  active  fault,  the
horizontal  design  loadings  in  Sections  19.2.1  and  19.2.2  may
not be conservative. Likewise, there are several conditions for
which  the  horizontal  design  loadings  are  overly  conservative
(e.g.,  rigid  equipment  with  rigid  internal  components  located
at  grade,  or  sites  with  favorable  soils  conditions).  For  these
conditions, designing based on the more detailed approach in
the  UBC  may  result  in  a  more  economical  design.  It  is
recommended that the user engage a professional mechanical,
civil, or structural engineer to make these determinations.
19. 3  The  supplier  should  provide  the  following  data
and  procedures  to  the  user.  This  information  should  be
included  in  the  installation  instructions  as  part  of  the
documentation covered in Section 9.
• A drawing of the equipment, its support equipment,
its  connections  (e.g.,  ventilation,  water,  vacuum,
gases)  and  the  anchorage  locations  identified  in
Section 19.4.
• The  type  of  feet  used  and  their  location  on  a  base
frame plan drawing.
• The weight distribution on each foot.
• Physical  dimensions,  including  width,  length,  and
height of each structurally independent module.
• Weight and location of the center of mass for each
structurally independent module.
• Acceptable  locations  on  the  equipment  frame  for
anchorage.
NOTE 88:  A   “structurally   independent   module”   reacts   to
seismic  loads  by  transferring  substantially  all  of  the  loads  to
its  own  anchorages,  as  opposed  to  transferring  the  loads  to
adjacent modules.


SEMI S2-0703a
E
© SEMI 1991, 2004 24
19. 4  The   locations   of   the   tie-ins,   attachments,   or
seismic anchorage points should be clearly identified.
NOTE 89:  It  is  not  the  intent  of  SEMI  S2  that  the  supplier
provide    the    seismic    attachment    point    hardware.    Such
hardware  may  be  provided  as  agreed  upon  between  supplier
and user.
NOTE 90:  It is the responsibility of the user to verify that the
vibration  isolation,  leveling,  seismic  reinforcing,  and  load
distribution is adequate.
20  Automated Material Handlers
20. 1  This  section  covers  automated  material  handlers,
which include:
• substrate handlers;
• industrial robots and industrial robot systems; and
• unmanned transport vehicles (UTVs).
NOTE 91:     Substrate   handlers   typically   handle   a   single
substrate  at  a  time,  and  are  distinguished  from  industrial
robots by their small load capacity.
20. 2  General — The means of incorporating personnel
safeguarding  into  automated  material  handlers  should
be  based  on  a  hazard  analysis.  The  hazard  analysis
should   include   consideration   of   the   size,   capacity,
speed, and spatial operating range of the handler.
20. 2.1  Subsystem  Stops  —  If  a  separate  stop  button  is
used  for  the  automated  material  handler,  it  should  be
differentiated from the EMO button.
20. 3  Substrate Handlers — See Section 20.2, General.
20. 4  Industrial  Robots  and  Industrial  Robot  Systems
— Industrial robots and industrial robot systems should
meet   the   requirements   of   appropriate   national   or
international  standards,  e.g.,  ANSI/RIA  R15.06,  ISO
10218,  EN  775.  If  there  are  deviations  from  these
standards because of semiconductor applications of the
robot,  these  deviations  may  be  found  acceptable  based
on risk assessments.
20. 5  UTVs
NOTE 92:  There are two basic types of UTVs: (1) the floor-
traveling  (including  both  rail-guided  and  rail-independent)
UTV,  that  automatically  travels  on  the  floor  to  a  specified
destination where it is unloaded or loaded; and (2) the space-
traveling UTV, which automatically travels without resting on
the  floor  (e.g.,  in  the  space  below  the  ceiling)  to  a  specified
destination  where  it  is  loaded  or  unloaded.  UTVs  do  not
include    rail-guided    mechanisms    that    are    attached    to
equipment (such as in wet benches).
20. 5.1  Collision  Avoidance  —  UTVs  generally  travel
in wide areas and are used in a system rather than stand
alone operation. UTVs should be equipped with a non-
contact  approach  sensing  device  so  that  they  do  not
inadvertently contact people or other objects.
20. 5.2  UTVs: Loading and Unloading Equipment
20. 5.2.1  UTVs  should  be  interlocked  with  equipment
such  as  semiconductor  process  equipment,  automated
load   ports,   stockers,   ground-based   conveyors,   and
automated warehouses as needed to ensure that the load
remains   secure   and   that   the   UTV   and   transfer
components are not in conflict with one another.
20. 5.2.2  If  loading  results  in  an  unsafe  condition,  the
equipment should detect and indicate the condition, and
movement   of   all   loading   equipment   should   stop
immediately.  The  system  should  not  reset  or  restart
automatically.
21  Environmental Considerations
21. 1  This    section    covers    environmental    impacts
throughout the life of the equipment.
NOTE 93:   It is recommended that environmental impacts be
balanced  against  other  factors,  including  safety  and  health,
legal, and regulatory requirements.
NOTE 94:  It is recommended that the manufacturer maintain
awareness   of   relevant   environmental   regulations,   either
internally or through the user.
NOTE 95:  The    user    is    responsible    for    providing    the
manufacturer  with  information  regarding  any  environmental
restrictions  that  are  specific  to  a  given  site  and  that  may
impact  equipment  design  (e.g.,  cumulative  emissions  limits,
permit requirements, site-specific programs).
NOTE 96:  See   Section   14   for   fire   suppression   emission
issues.
NOTE 97:  References  to  “process”  in  this  section  are  meant
to refer to the baseline process.
21. 2  Design
21. 2.1  The  following  design  guidelines  apply  to  all
phases     of     equipment     life,     from     concept     to
decommissioning and disposal.
NOTE 98:  The  documentation  described  in  Sections  8.5.3
and  9.4  provide  information  that  can  be  used  for  evaluating
conformance to this section.
21. 2.2  Resource Conservation
21. 2.2.1  The  manufacturer  should  consider  resource
conservation  (i.e.,  reduction,  reuse,  recycling)  during
equipment design, for example:
• water    reuse    or    water    recycling    within    the
equipment;
• reduced  chemical  consumption,  energy  use,  and
water  use  (e.g.,  reducing  resource  use  when  no
process is occurring);


SEMI S2-0703a
E
© SEMI 1991, 2004 25
• reduced   use   of   resources   during   maintenance
procedures  (e.g.,  parts  cleaning  procedures  could
include minimum rinse rates and rinse times);
• recycling  or  reusing  chemicals  in  the  equipment,
rather than consuming only new materials;
• reducing volume of packaging, increasing recycled
content  of  packaging,  and/or  designing  reusable
packaging.
21. 2.3  Chemical Selection
21. 2.3.1  Chemical  selection  for  process,  maintenance,
and utility uses (e.g., gases, etchants, strippers, cleaners,
lubricants,   and   coolants)   should   take   into   account
effectiveness,  environmental  impacts,  volume,  toxicity,
by-products,       decommissioning,       disposal,       and
recyclability;  use  of  the  least  hazardous  chemical  is
preferred.   To   the   extent   practicable,   the   utilities,
maintenance,  and  process  should  be  designed  so  that
the equipment operates without the use of:
• ozone depleting substances (ODSs) as identified by
the Montreal Protocol, such as chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs),     methylchloroform,     hydrochlorofluoro-
carbons (HCFCs), and carbon tetrachloride, or
• perfluorocompounds  (PFCs),  including  CF

due  to  their  global
warming potential.
21. 2.4  Prevention and Control of Unintended Releases
21. 2.4.1  Equipment   design,   including   feed,   storage,
and  waste  collection  systems,  should  prevent  potential
unintended releases. At a minimum:
21. 2.4.2  Secondary  containment  for  liquids  should  be
capable of holding at least 110% (see first row of Table
A3-1 of Appendix 3) of the volume of the single largest
container, or the largest expected volume for any single
point failure.
NOTE 99:  In   some   circumstances   secondary   containment
may  be  specified  by  the  equipment  supplier,  but  provided  by
the user.
21. 2.4.3  Chemical  storage  containers  and  secondary
containment  should  be  designed  for  accessibility  and
easy removal of collected material.
21. 2.4.4  Secondary  containment  should  have  alarms
and  gas  detection  or  liquid  sensing,  as  appropriate,  or
have  recommended  sensing  points  identified  in  the
equipment installation instructions.
21. 2.4.5  Equipment  design  should  allow  personnel    to
determine      all      in-equipment      container      levels
conveniently  without  having  to  open  the  containers,
where   ignorance   of   the   level   could   result   in   an
inadvertent release.
21. 2.4.6  Overfill  level  detectors  and  alarms  should  be
provided for in-equipment containers.
21. 2.4.7  Secondary   containment   and   other   control
systems  should  be  designed  to  ensure  that  chemicals
cannot   be   combined,   where   the   combination   could
result in an inadvertent release.
21. 2.4.8  Equipment  components  should  be  compatible
with   chemicals   used   in   the   manufacturing   process.
Chemical  systems  should  be  designed  for  the  specified
operating  conditions,  and  have  sufficient  mechanical
strength and corrosion resistance for the intended use.
21. 2.4.9  Equipment  should  be  able  to  accept  a  signal
from   a   monitoring   device   and   stop   the   supply   of
chemical,  at  the  first  non-manual  valve  within  the
affected system.
21. 2.4.10  Chemical   distribution   systems   should   be
capable of automatic shutoff and remote shutdown.
21. 2.5  Effluents, Wastes, and Emissions
NOTE 100:  It    is    recommended    that    the    manufacturer
document  its  efforts  to  minimize  the  equipment’s  generation
of   hazardous   wastes,   solid   wastes,   wastewater,   and   air
emissions.
NOTE 101:  It  is  recommended  that  SEMI  F5  be  used  for
guidance in gaseous effluent handling.
21. 2.5.1  Equipment  design  that  allows  connection  to  a
central  waste  collection  system  is  preferred,  except
where   collection   at   the   equipment   may   facilitate
recycling  or  reuse  opportunities  or  otherwise  reduce
environmental impacts.
NOTE 102:  It  is  recommended  that  individual  drains  and
exhausts be kept separate (e.g., separate outlets for acid drain,
solvent   drain,   deionized   (DI)   water   drain;   acid   exhaust,
solvent exhaust).
21. 2.5.1.1  Point-of-use  collection  containers  should  be
designed  for  accessibility  as  well  as  the  possible  reuse
and recycling of the collected materials.
21. 2.5.2  Equipment   should   use   partitions,   double-
contained  lines,  or  other  similar  design  features  to
prevent the mixing of incompatible waste streams.
21. 2.5.3  The     manufacturer     should     evaluate     the
feasibility  of  including  integrated  controls  for  effluent
and emission treatment.
21. 2.5.4  Dilution   in   excess   of   process   or   safety
requirements should not be used to reduce contaminant
discharge concentrations.
21. 2.5.5  Segregation     of     effluents,     wastes,     and
emissions should be provided in the following cases:
• where chemically incompatible;


SEMI S2-0703a
E
© SEMI 1991, 2004 26
• where segregation facilitates recycling or reuse; or
• where separate abatement or treatment methods are
required.
NOTE 103:    It  is  recommended  that  the  equipment  design
documentation show evidence of consideration of by-products
generated during equipment operation, clean-up, maintenance,
and  repair.  By-products  can  include  deposits  in  drains  or
ducts,  and  replaceable  parts  (e.g.,  batteries,  vapor  lamps,
contaminated parts).
21. 2.6  Decommissioning and Disposal
21. 2.6.1  Equipment design should address (see Section
8. 5.3    for    documentation    provisions)    construction
material   and   component   reuse,   refurbishment,   and
recycling.
21. 2.6.2  The equipment should be designed to facilitate
equipment decontamination and disposal, e.g., by use of
removable liners or replaceable modules. This includes
minimizing    the    number    of        parts    that    become
contaminated with hazardous materials.
NOTE 104:  It  is  recommended  that  SEMI  S12  “Guidelines
for Equipment Decontamination” be used for guidance during
equipment decontamination.
22  Exhaust Ventilation
22. 1  Equipment exhaust ventilation should be designed
to  prevent  potentially  hazardous  chemical  exposures  to
employees as follows:
22. 1.1  As   primary   control   when   normal   operations
present  potentially  hazardous  chemical  exposures  to
employees   by   diffusive   emissions   that   cannot   be
otherwise prevented or controlled (e.g., wet decks, spin
coaters).
NOTE 105:  In  the  context  of  this  section,  “primary  control”
means  that  it  is  the  control  of  first  choice  (e.g.,  rather  than
personal protective equipment).
22. 1.2  As   supplemental   control   when   intermittent
activities   (e.g.,   chamber   cleaning,   implant   source
housing    cleaning)    present    potentially    hazardous
chemical    exposures    to    employees    which    cannot
reasonably be controlled by other means. Supplemental
exhaust hoods or enclosures may be integrated into the
equipment   design,   or   supplied   completely   by   the
equipment user.
22. 1.2.1  When a procedure (e.g., cleaning) specified by
the  supplier  requires  exhaust  ventilation,  the  supplier
should include the minimum criteria for exhaust during
the procedure.
22. 1.3  As   secondary   control   when   a   single-point
failure presents the potential for employee exposures to
hazardous   materials,   and   this   exposure   cannot   be
controlled  by  other  means  (e.g.,  use  of  all  welded
fittings).
EXCEPTION:  Secondary  exhaust  control  enclosures
for non-welded connections (e.g., valve manifold boxes
that  enclose  piping  jungles)  are  not  included  in  this
guideline for those hazardous gases that are transported
below  atmospheric  pressure  (e.g.,  via  vacuum  piping
systems)  if  it  can  be  demonstrated  that  equivalent  leak
protection   is   provided.   Equivalent   protection   may
include  such  things  as  equipping  the  vacuum  delivery
system    with    a    fail-safe    (e.g.,    to    close)    valve
automatically  activated  by  a  loss  of  vacuum  pressure.
Loss  of  vacuum  pressure  should  also  activate  a  visual
and audible alarm provided in visual or audible range of
the operator.
22. 2  Equipment exhaust ventilation should be designed
and  a  ventilation  assessment  conducted  (see  Section
23. 5, Appendix 2, and SEMI S6) to control, efficiently
and  safely,  for  potential  worst-case,  realistic  employee
exposures   to   chemicals   during   normal   operation,
maintenance, or failure of other equipment components
(hardware  or  software).  All  design  criteria  and  test
protocols  should  be  based  on  recognized  methods.  See
also Section 23.3.
22. 3  Documentation  should  be  developed  showing  the
equipment    exhaust    parameters    and    relevant    test
methods, and should include (see also Appendix 2):
• duct   velocity   (where   needed   to   transport   solid
particles);
• volumetric flow rate Q;
• capture  velocity  (where  airborne  contaminants  are
generated outside an enclosure);
• face velocity (where applicable);
• hood entry loss factor F
h
or K;
• coefficient of entry C
e.
;
• hood static pressure SP
h
;
• duct   diameter   at   the   point   of   connection   to
facilities; and
• location(s)    on    the    duct    or    hood    where    all
ventilation measurements were taken.
22. 4  Exhaust flow interlocks should be provided by the
manufacturer  on  all  equipment  that  uses  hazardous
production  materials  (HPMs)  where  loss  of  exhaust
may  create  a  hazard.  Flow  (e.g.,  pitot  probe)  or  static
pressure  (e.g.,  manometer)  switches  are  the  preferred
sensing methods.

NOTE 106:  Sail  switches  (switches  that  are  connected  to  a
lever that relies upon air velocity to activate) are generally not
recommended.
NOTE 107:  It  is  recommended  that  the  pressure  or  flow
measuring point be located upstream of the first damper.
NOTE 108:  Section    11    contains    provisions    for    safety
interlocks.
22. 4.1  When the exhaust falls below the prescribed set
point,  an  alarm  should  be  provided  within  audible  or
visible range of the operator, and the process equipment
should be placed in a safe stand-by mode. A time delay
and  exhaust  setpoint  for  the  equipment  to  go  into
standby   mode   may   be   allowable,   based   on   an
appropriate   risk   assessment.   The   system   should   be
capable of interfacing with the facility alarm system.
NOTE 109:  It   is   recommended   that   non-HPM   chemical
process   exhaust   be   equipped   with   audible   and   visible
indicators only.
22. 4.2  Exhaust   flow   interlocks   and   alarms   should
require manual resetting.
22. 4.3  Exhaust flow interlocks should be fault-tolerant.
22. 5  Equipment  and  equipment  components  should  be
designed using good ventilation principles and practices
to  ensure  chemical  capture  and  to  optimize  exhaust
efficiency (see Appendix 2).
NOTE 110:  It  is  recommended  that  exhaust  optimization  be
achieved with total equipment static pressure requirements of
–1 to –38 mm (–0.05 to –1.5") H
2
O (see also Section A2-1 of
Appendix 2, and Section 8.3.6.1 of SEMI S6-93).
23  Chemicals
23. 1  The   manufacturer   should   generate   a   chemical
inventory  identifying  the  chemicals  anticipated  to  be
used or generated in the equipment. At a minimum, this
should   include   chemicals   in   the   recipe   used   for
equipment qualification or “baseline” recipe, as well as
intended reaction products and anticipated by-products.
Chemicals   on   this   list   that   can   be   classified   as
hazardous  production  materials  (HPMs),  or  odorous
(odor   threshold   <   1   ppm)   or   irritant   chemicals
(according  to  their  material  safety  data  sheets),  should
also be identified.
23. 2  A  hazard  analysis  (see  Section  6.8)  should  be
used as an initial determination of chemical risk as well
as  to  validate  that  the  risk  has  been  controlled  to  an
appropriate level.
23. 2.1  The   hazard   analysis,   at   a   minimum,   should
address the following conditions:
• potential mixing of incompatible chemicals;
• potential    chemical    emissions    during    routine
operation;
• potential  chemical  emissions  during  maintenance
activities; and
• potential  key  failure  points  and  trouble  spots  (e.g.,
fittings, pumps).
23. 2.2  All routes of exposure (e.g., respiratory, dermal)
should be considered in exposure assessment.
23. 3  The  order  of  preference  for  controls  in  reducing
chemical-related risks is as follows:
23. 3.1  substitution   or   elimination   (see   also   Section
21. 2.2);
23. 3.2  engineering       controls       (e.g.,       enclosure,
ventilation, interlocks);
23. 3.3  administrative  controls  (e.g.,  written  warnings,
standard operating procedures);
23. 3.4  personal protective equipment.
23. 4  The    design    of    engineering    controls    (e.g.,
enclosure,    ventilation,    interlocks)    should    include
consideration of (see also Appendix 3):
• pressure requirements;
• materials incompatibility;
• equipment maintainability;
• chemical containment; and
• provisions for exhaust ventilation (see Section 22).
23. 5  During   equipment   development,   the   supplier
should    conduct    an    assessment    that    documents
conformance to the following airborne chemical control
criteria (see also Appendix 2). All measurements should
be  taken  using  recognized  methods  with  documented
sensitivities  and  accuracy.  A  report  documenting  the
survey    methods,    equipment    operating    parameters,
instrumentation   used,   calibration   data,   results,   and
discussion should be available.
23. 5.1  There  should  be  no  chemical  emissions  to  the
workplace    environment    during    normal    equipment
operation. Conformance to this section can be shown by
demonstrating  ambient  air  concentrations  to  be  less
than  1%  of  the  Occupational  Exposure  Limit  (OEL)  in
the   worst-case   personnel   breathing   zone.   Where   a
recognized    method    does    not    provide    sufficient
sensitivity   to   measure   1%   OEL,   then   the   lower
detection limit of the method may be used to satisfy this
criterion.
23. 5.2  Chemical     emissions     during     maintenance
activities  should  be  minimized.  Conformance  to  this


SEMI S2-0703a

section  can  be  shown  by  demonstrating  ambient  air
concentrations  to  be  less  than  25%  of  the  OEL,  in  the
anticipated worst-case personnel breathing zone, during
maintenance activities.
23. 5.3  Chemical  emissions  during  equipment  failures
should  be  minimized.  Conformance  to  this  section  can
be  shown  by  demonstrating  ambient  air  concentrations
to  be  less  than  25%  of  the  OEL,  in  the  anticipated
worst-case  personnel  breathing  zone,  during  a  realistic
worst-case system failure.
NOTE 111:  The  use  of  direct  reading  instrumentation  under
simulated  operating,  maintenance,  or  failure  conditions  is  the
preferred     measurement     method.     Where     used,     it     is
recommended that the sample location(s) be representative of
the    worst-case,    realistic    exposure    locations(s).    It    is
recommended    that    the    peak    concentration    be    directly
compared to the OEL to demonstrate conformance to Sections
23. 5.1–23.5.3.
NOTE 112:  It   is   recommended   that   integrated   sampling
methods  be  used  when  direct-reading  instrumentation  does
not    have    adequate    sensitivity,    or    when    direct-reading
technology  is  not  available  for  the  chemicals  of  interest.
Where integrated sampling is used, it is recommended that the
sample  duration  and  locations(s)  be  representative  of  the
worst-case,  realistic,  anticipated  exposure  time  and  locations.
The  resulting  average  concentration  is  directly  compared  to
the  OEL  to  demonstrate  conformance  to  Sections  23.5.1–
23. 5.3.
NOTE 113:  Tracer   gas   testing   (see   SEMI   F15   for   an
acceptable   method)   may   be   used   when   direct-reading
instrumentation  does  not  have  adequate  sensitivity,  or  when
direct-reading technology is not available for the chemicals of
interest.  Tracer  gas  testing  should  be  used  where  testing
conditions  may  be  hazardous  (e.g.,  system  failure  simulation
with  potential  release  of  hazardous  gas  to  atmosphere).  It  is
recommended  that  tracer  gas  testing  be  used  only  when  an
accurate rate of chemical emission can be determined. Where
used,   it   is   recommended   that   the   sample   location(s)   be
representative of the worst-case, realistic exposure location(s).
23. 5.4  Chemical    emissions    outside    the    enclosure
during  a  realistic  worst-case  system  failure  should  be
less than the lower of the following two values: 25% of
the lower explosive limit (LEL), or 25% of the OEL.
23. 6  Equipment that uses hazardous gases may require
continuous  detection  and,  if  so,  should  have  sample
points     mounted     in     the     equipment,     or     have
recommended    sampling    points    identified    in    the
equipment   installation   instructions.   Where   the   gas
supply  is  part  of  or  controlled  by  the  equipment,  the
equipment  should  be  able  to  accept  a  signal  from  an
external monitoring device and shut down the supply of
the gas.
23. 7  Appropriate   hazard   warning   labels   should   be
placed at all chemical enclosure access openings.
24  Ionizing Radiation
24. 1  This   section   covers   equipment   that   produces
ionizing  radiation  (e.g.,  X-rays,  gamma  rays)  or  uses
radioactive sources.
24. 2  Accessible emissions of ionizing radiation should
be  designed  as  low  as  reasonably  achievable.  This
criteria  can  be  met  by  demonstrating  conformance  to
the   provisions   in   Sections   24.2.1   and   24.2.2   and
Appendix 4.
24. 2.1  Accessible  levels  of  ionizing  radiation  during
normal  operations  should  be  less  than  2  microsieverts
(0.2  millirem)  per  hour  above  background.  See  also
Table A4-1 of Appendix 4.
24. 2.2  Accessible  levels  of  ionizing  radiation  during
maintenance and service procedures should be less than
10    microsieverts    (1    millirem)    per    hour    above
background. See also Table A4-1 of Appendix 4.
24. 2.3  Access  to  radioactive  contamination  or  internal
exposure   (e.g.,   inhalation,   ingestion)   to   radioactive
materials   should   be   minimized.   The   hazards   and
controls  for  the  prevention  of  personnel  contamination
and   internal   exposures   should   be   detailed   in   the
operation and maintenance manuals.
NOTE 114:  The   use   of   radioactive   material   is   strictly
regulated around the world. Import, export, and transportation
of radioactive materials is also highly regulated. Licenses may
be   required   to   possess,   use,   and   distribute   radioactive
materials.
NOTE 115:  Many   regions   require   both   user   and   import
licenses,  and  the  timely  acquisition  of  these  licenses  depends
on the information provided by the equipment supplier.
NOTE 116:  Radiation producing machines are also regulated
around  the  world.  Regulations  and  licensing  requirements
may  cover  activities  such  as  importing,  exporting,  installing,
servicing and using radiation producing equipment.
24. 2.4  The  manufacturer  should  supply,  in  the  user
documentation, a contact phone number and address for
the manufacturer’s radiation safety support personnel.
24. 3  Equipment should be designed to minimize access
or   exposure   to   ionizing   radiation   during   normal
operation,     maintenance,     and     service.     Potential
exposures should be controlled in the following order of
preference:
24. 3.1  Engineering  Controls  —  Engineering  controls
(e.g.   shielding,   interlocks)   should   be   the   primary
mechanism  to  minimize  emission  of  ionizing  radiation
or access to ionizing radiation.
24. 3.1.1  Radiation     shielding     for     the     equipment
facilities   connections   (e.g.,   gas   and   exhaust   lines)
should be designed such that  removal and replacement
of the shielding during installation is minimized.


SEMI S2-0703a

24. 3.2  Non-defeatable   safety   interlocks   should   be
provided  on  barriers  preventing  maintenance  access  to
radiation fields in excess of 10 microsieverts (μSv) or 1
millirem per hour.
24. 3.3  Administrative         Controls         —         When
administrative  controls  (e.g.,  distance,  time,  standard
operating  procedures,  labeling)  are  to  be  used,  the
equipment      supplier      should      provide      detailed
documentation  explaining  the  use  of  the  administrative
controls.
24. 4  Equipment    utilizing    or    producing    ionizing
radiation should be labeled appropriately.
NOTE 117:  Label    contents    are    typically    controlled    by
regulation in the country in which the equipment is to be used.
24. 5  The  manufacturer  should  conduct  an  assessment
to  document  conformance  to  the  criteria  specified  in
Sections    24.2.1    through    24.2.2    during    normal
equipment operation, maintenance, and service.
24. 5.1  A  radiation  survey  should  be  used  to  confirm
design  compliance  and  serve  as  a  baseline  survey  (see
also Table A4-1 of Appendix 4).
24. 5.2  Measurements should be taken using recognized
methods with documented sensitivities and accuracy. A
report   documenting   the   survey   methods,   equipment
operating  parameters,  instrumentation  used,  calibration
data, source locations, results, and discussion should be
made available.
24. 5.3  If   supplemental   administrative   controls   are
recommended based on survey results or calculations, a
discussion  should  be  provided  in  the  operations  and
maintenance  manuals  describing  the  source  locations,
radiation levels, and recommended control measures.
NOTE 118:  Ionizing  radiation  sources  must  be  registered  or
licensed   according   to   the   regulations   of   the   country   of
destination.  These  radiation  sources  must  conform  to  the
regulations    of    central    or    local    government    agencies,
whichever is stricter.
NOTE 119:  It  is  recommended  that  equipment  containing
radioactive   materials   should   demonstrate   conformance   to
licensing with local regulatory agencies prior to shipment.
NOTE 120:  Equipment  that  uses  particle  acceleration  in  its
process has the potential for generating ionizing radiation as a
result of nuclear interactions between the accelerated particles
and  various  materials.  These  materials  can  include  materials
of   construction   of   the   equipment,   accumulated   residual
process materials in the equipment, and the target materials.
25  Non-Ionizing Radiation and Fields
25. 1  This section covers equipment that produces non-
ionizing radiation, except laser sources, in the following
categories:
• static electric and magnetic (0 Hz),
• sub-radio  frequency  electric  and  magnetic  fields
( < 3 kHz),
• radio frequency (3 kHz–300 GHz),
• infrared radiation (700 nm–1 mm),
• visible Light (400 nm–700 nm), and
• ultraviolet Light (180–400 nm).
25. 2  Potentially    hazardous    non-ionizing    radiation
emissions that are accessible to any personnel should be
limited  to  the  lowest  practical  level.  This  criterion  can
be met by demonstrating conformance to the following
provisions:
EXCEPTION:   Emissions   of   non-ionizing   radiation
exceeding  the  cardiac  pacemaker  limits  in  Appendix  5
but  less  than  the  levels  in  Sections  25.2.1  and  25.2.2
should be identified with appropriate labeling. See also
Section 25.5.1.
25. 2.1  Accessible   levels   of   non-ionizing   radiation
during  normal  operations  are  less  than  the  Operator-
Accessible Limit (see Appendix 5);
25. 2.2  Accessible   levels   of   non-ionizing   radiation
during  maintenance  and  service  procedures  are  less
than  the  Maintenance-  and  Service-Accessible  Limit
(see Appendix 5).
25. 3  Sources   of   potentially   hazardous   non-ionizing
radiation  should  be  identified  in  the  operation  and
maintenance   manuals,   and   appropriate   parameters
listed.    Parameters    include    frequency,    wavelength,
power  levels,  continuous  wave  or  pulsed  (see  also
Appendix  5).  If  pulsed,  parameters  also  include  the
pulse  repetition  rate,  pulse  duration,  and  description  of
the pulse waveform.
EXCEPTION: Visible sources which are intended to be
viewed  or  which  provide  illumination  (e.g.,  display
panels,  visible  alarm  indicators),  and  are  not  lasers,  do
not need to be identified.
NOTE 121:  It  is  recommended  that  UV/IR  generators  that
are  part  of  fire  protection  test  apparatus,  and  are  provided
with  the  equipment,  be  considered  as  possible  sources  of
potentially hazardous non-ionizing radiation.
25. 4  Equipment should be designed to minimize access
or  exposure  to  non-ionizing  radiation  during  normal
operation,     maintenance,     and     service.     Potential
exposures should be controlled in the following order of
preference:
25. 4.1  engineering  controls  (e.g.,  enclosure,  shielding,
guarding, grounding, interlocks);
