SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 2000 26 12.4.3 Modifying Process Program V ariableParameters  The remote commands of PP-SELECT,PP-ASSIGN, or PP-UPDATE are used to modify anyof the identified process program variable parameterswithin the process program. The modification is doneby including CPNAME/CPVAL pairs within thePROCESS-BLD-GROUP, which is part of theremote commands of PP-SELECT or PP-ASSIGN, orby including a different list name in the PP-UPDATEremote command. A CPNAME in a process programshall be identical to the process program variableparameter name as specified in the PROCESS-BLD-GROUP. See next section for details of theseparameters.12.5 Use of Process Programs, Rem ote Commands,and PROCESS-BLD-GROUP  This is a briefdescription of the steps involved in using the processprogram structure, the process program variableparameters, the TABLE-DEFs, and the modification ofprocess program variable parameters through the use ofPROCESS-BLD-GROUP and CPNAME/CEPVALpairs in the enhanced remote command (S2,F49). A process program is created with certain items inthe body identified as process program variableparameters, along with their default values. The host sends to equipment one or more TABLE-DEFs: such as TABLE-AREA-DEF andTABLE-ALIGN-DEF, along with the names ofthose tables using Stream 13 commands (See SEMIE5). These tables are now resident on theequipment. The host sends an enhanced remote command(S2,F49) to the equipment (either PP-SELECT orPP-ASSIGN) that contains the information neededfor processing (CARRIERBLD). TheCARRIERBLD contains a PROCESS-BLD-GROUP for each different set of run parametersthat are needed during the inspection or reviewprocess. PROCESS-BLD-GROUP shall contain theProcessBuildGroupID to identify which program isselected. If the default list of slots in the process programneeds to be changed for this run, then PROCESS-BLD-GROUP contains a MATERIALLIST andthe list of selected slots or substrates, designated bySlotIDs or SubstrateIDs. If the default set of inspection areas in the processprogram needs to be changed for this run, thenPROCESS-BLD-GROUP contains the name of aspecific TABLE-AREA-DEF (in AreaTableName). If not all of the inspection areas given in that TABLE-AREA-DEF are needed for this run,then AREALIST is used and includes a list of thenames of the specific inspection areas which areneeded. Those names refer to inspection areasdefined in the TABLE-AREA-DEF. If the default set of alignment sites in the processprogram needs to be changed for this run, thenPROCESS-BLD-GROUP contains the name of aspecific TABLE-ALIGN-DEF (in AlignTableName). If not all of the alignment sites given inthat TABLE-ALIGN-DEF are needed for thisrun, then ALIGNLIST is used and includes a listof the names of the specific alignment sites whichare needed. Those names refer to alignment sitesdefined in the TABLE-ALIGN-DEF. If the SEMI M21 coordinate system is being usedand a pattern has been defined with pattern elementnames and if only certain of those elements need tobe inspected for this run, then PROCESS-BLD-GROUP contains an ELEMENTLIST and thelist of selected elements, designated byElementIDs. If certain equipment-specific process programvariable parameters need to have different valuesfor this run, then for each needed parameter,PROCESS-BLD-GROUP contains a CPNAME(unique name of a specific process programvariable parameter) and the new CEPVAL (newvalue for that parameter). The equipment executes the process program withthe new values. If indicated in the process program, the equipmentgenerates the list of anomalies found and sends it tothe host in the format of a TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF using the ISEM table definition and Stream13 transfer messages (see SEMI E5 for formatspecification). The host would send the TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF to a review equipment. The host might needto modify part of the table if required by the reviewequipment. This anomaly table is now resident onthe review equipment. (NOTE: The host mightchoose to not send all of the table of anomalies, butrather a desired selection of them.) The host sends the equipment the enhanced remotecommand (PP-SELECT or PP-ASSIGN) thatcontains a CARRIERBLD. TheCARRIERBLD has a PROCESS-BLD-GROUP for each different set of run parametersthat is needed by the review equipment. It isrequired for the host to use the Enhanced RemoteCommand S2,F49 for transferring the information

&lt;!-- Page 2 --&gt;

SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 200027 to the equipment. PROCESS-BLD-GROUPincludes the name of a specific TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF in the parameterAnomalyTableName. If not all of the anomaliesgiven in that TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF areneeded for this run, then either ANOMALYLISTor M21-ANOMALYLIST is used and includes alist of the names of the specific anomalies whichare desired. Those names refer to anomaliesdefined in the named TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF. The equipment runs the process program using theselected values and reviewing the specificanomalies indicated. The equipment adds review information to theANOMALYATTRIBUTE list. Then the reviewequipment sends this modified TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF to the host. 13 Remote CommandsThe purpose of this section is to identify remotecommands, command parameters, and valid commandsversus states pertinent to the SEM. 13.1 Requirements The equipment shall support the SEMI E30required remote commands. All the remote commands defined by ISEM arerequired unless they have been qualified by thestatement if the equipment supports thisfunctionality, it shall use this command. In thiscase, they are only required if the equipmentsupports the functionality necessary to support thecommand. A good example of this is the MAP-CARRIER command. If the equipment does nothave the hardware necessary to scan a carrier forthe presence of substrates in slots, then thecommand is not required by the ISEM. The alphanumeric strings defined by ISEM forRCMD and CPNAME are required.Host Command Parameter (CPNAME/CPVAL)  Aparameter name/value associated with a particular hostcommand when using stream function (S2,F41) and a(CPNAME/CEPVAL) parameter name/value whenusing the enhanced remote command (S2,F49). Thisdocument specifies unique names (CPNAMEs) andvalues (CPVALs and CEPVALs) for many commandparameters. Note that if there are no associatedparameters, a zero length list is sent.The purpose of the remote commands is to allow hostcontrol over the following capabilities:  Start processing  Stop processing Temporarily suspend processing Resume processing Abort processing Select process programs, material, and/or sites tomeasure Report location of material foundThe following remote commands (RCMDs) shall besupported as described below:NOTE 3: The terms current cycle and safe point usedbelow are to be defined by the supplier. 13.2 Remote Commands Descriptio n1. ABORT  Terminate the current cycle prior to itscompletion. ABORT has the intent of immediatelystopping the process and is used because ofabnormal conditions. ABORT makes no guaranteeabout the subsequent condition of material exceptas noted in the ABORTLEVEL description.2. CLEANUP  De-selection of the current ISEMjob (CARRIERBLD) and process program(PROCESS-BLD-GROUP), including theremoval of all material to output locations and anyequipment-specific activities needed to transitioninto the IDLE state. Completion of this commandshould generate a collection event report. If theequipment supports this functionality, it will usethis command.3. MAP-CARRIER  Requests the equipment toprovide a list of carrier slots that contain material.MAP-CARRIER has the intent of providing thehost with enough information about the locationand/or ID of material so it may select material forprocessing accordingly. Completion of thiscommand shall generate a collection event report.If the equipment supports this functionality, it mustuse this command.4. NEXT-MATERIAL  Processing of the currentsubstrate is halted at the first safe point andunloaded to the target carrier location. NEXT-MATERIAL has the intent of allowing the host toskip measurement of the current substrate. This is atrigger for processing state transition fromWORKING to UNLOAD. If the equipmentsupports this functionality, it will use thiscommand.5. PAUSE  Suspend processing temporarily at thenext safe point. PAUSE has the intent of resumingthe process at the same point where it was paused.

&lt;!-- Page 3 --&gt;

SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 2000 28 RESUME or PP-UPDATE may be used to resumethe process.6. PP-ASSIGN  Instructs the equipment thatsupports queuing to create a new ISEM job(CARRIERBLD) for the specified port(LOCATIONID) when more than one port isavailable for processing. If only one port isavailable, LOCATIONID is not required.Priority may optionally be specified with thiscommand. The PRIORITY specifies the priorityof the newly created job in the ISEM job queue (avalue of 0 (zero) assigns the highest priority to thejob). Without specifying a priority, the job isqueued with the default priority. Jobs with equalpriority are queued in the order the PP-ASSIGNcommands are received. This command is valid inall PROCESSING states.7. PP-SELECT  Instructs the equipment to makethe requested ISEM job(s) (CARRIERBLD)available in the execution area. This is a trigger forthe processing state transition from IDLE toSETTING UP. The first process program(PROCESS-BLD-GROUP) specified in theCARRIERBLD is also validated duringSETTING UP.8. PP-UNASSIGN  Removes the ISEM jobassignment (CARRIERBLD) for a carrier orport. The carrier or port is removed from theprocess queue.9. PP-UPDATE  Provides the ability to alter thecurrent process program being executed during thePAUSED state. The process program variablesspecified in the PP-UPDATE command will replace previous definitions in the PROCESS-BLD-GROUP. This command will triggertransition to CHECKING for process programparameter verification. A RESUME command isimplied with the validation of all replaced valuesto resume the process. If the PP-UPDATE fails, theprocess program variables present prior to the PP-UPDATE are retained. If no parameters values arespecified, the defaults are used.10. RESUME  Resume processing from the pointwhere the process was paused. This is the triggerfor processing state transition from PROCESSPAUSE to the previous PROCESS state.11. START  Instructs the equipment to initiateprocessing. This is the trigger for the processingstate transition from READY to LOAD. AnAUTOSTART command parameter may beincluded to allow for continuous processing.12. STOP  Complete the current cycle, stop in a safecondition, and return to the IDLE processing state.Stop has the intent of stopping the process entirely.This command can be used to both: stop the currentISEM job or to stop all queued jobs. Theequipment is not required to support thecontinuation of processing. 13.2.1 Remote Commands and Associ ated HostCommand Parameters  This table describes theallowable command parameters (CPNAME) for eachremote command (RCMD). Equipment shall support allparameters. The column marked Req/Opt specifieswhich parameters are required to be sent by the hostand which parameters may be optionally sent by thehost.Table 8 Allowable Command Parameters ParametersRemote CommandCPName Req/Opt CommentsABORT ABORTLEVEL RCLEANUP CARRIERIDLOCATIONIDSLOTID OOO PORT and SLOT may be used to define adifferent carrier/slot destination for thesubstrates.MAP-CARRIER CARRIERIDLOCATIONIDR\*R\*\* One is required.

SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 200039 RELATED INFORMATION 1 NOTE: This related information is not an official part ofSEMI E30.1 and was approved for publication by full letterballot procedures on September 3, 1999. R1-1 Defect Classification Code ManagementThe purpose of this section is to provide a method andspecific formats to define, identify, and communicatecoordinate systems and site locations on substrates foralignment sites, anomaly locations, and other sites usedby the ISEM equipment.R1-1.1 Classification Codes and Defect Classification One function of review equipment is to viewpreviously identified anomalies and to associate adefect classification code with each anomaly. Aclassification code is an identifier for a classificationdescription.Typically, the review equipment has a set of defectclassification codes and their descriptions available tothe operator. Then, for each anomaly, the operatorselects a particular code to be associated with thatanomaly. This action is defect classification.The set of valid classification codes and theirdescriptions may change from one run to another. Forexample, the same main process program could be usedwith different substrate levels, and each level may use adifferent set of classification codes. The purpose of thissection is to provide the requirements so that a user canboth define several sets of classification codes and theirdescriptions and can also manage these sets on ISEMequipment.R1-1.2 Requirements  Each set of classification codes and theirdescriptions shall have an identifier, known as aclassification code set ID. Review equipment shall provide a means for theuser (the host or the operator) to define aclassification code set, consisting of (a) theclassification code set ID and (b) the list ofclassification codes and their descriptions. Equipment shall provide a means to manage thevarious classification code sets. A main process program shall include a processprogram variable that specifies the particularclassification code set ID to be used. Equipment vendor shall provide documentation tothe user regarding how to define and manageclassification code sets. Comment: In one implementation, the equipmentconsiders a classification code set to be a sub-processprogram or an ISEM table. This would allow the user toidentify a classification code set by name (using aPPID) or a table name and thereby managing this sub-process program with the SEMI E30 Process ProgramCapability or with SEMI E58 ARAMS tables. R1-2 Reporting Coordinates and CoordinateSystemsThe purpose of this section is to provide a method andspecific formats to define, identify, and communicatecoordinate systems and site locations on substrates foralignment sites, anomaly locations, and other sites usedby ISEM equipment.The ISEM-required formats are intended to minimizethe number and type of site location formattransformations needing to be supported by bothequipment suppliers and users.All ISEM-required site location formats involve the useof an ISEM-defined right-handed Cartesian coordinatesystem, established on substrates in an ISEM-definedmanner. The scope of the detailed methods in thissection are specific to unpatterned and patterned wafersin this release, but the section is intended to be generalenough in methodology so that it can be extended toother substrate types in future revisions of ISEM, ifrequired.The purpose of inspection and review equipment is tolocate, evaluate, classify, and report anomalies onsubstrates. ISEM equipment may deal with eitherunpatterned or patterned substrates or both. In mostcases, the anomaly location is part of the informationreported and/or used by ISEM equipment. An anomalylocation is reported at a particular site with x,ycoordinates in a particular coordinate system. Sitecoordinates are also used by ISEM equipment for thealignment sites for defining a coordinate system on asubstrate. A standard method is needed to define acoordinate system and to report site coordinates forboth alignment sites, anomaly locations, and any otherreference sites needed by ISEM equipment. A standardmethod is essential in order to transfer the anomaly siteinformation from one equipment to another.R1-2.1 Site Location Accuracy  Each equipment hasan accuracy with which it can define or locate a site asbeing within a certain area. This area associated with asite is determined by the equipment accuracy, based onthe accuracy of its motion and imaging systems tolocate a site, as well as on the accuracy with which itcan define the coordinate system on the substrate.

&lt;!-- Page 15 --&gt;

SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 2000 40 When equipment shall locate a particular site on asubstrate based on the expected or design-basedlocation, then the location of a site or feature on anactual substrate is further affected by the accuracy ofthe equipment which placed the pattern on thesubstrate.R1-2.2 Expected or Designed Locations vs. ActualLocations  The placement of patterns, sites, andcoordinate systems is designed to be at certainmathematically described locations relative to oneanother and to an ideal substrate. These are theexpected or designed locations. When a pattern iswritten by equipment onto a specific substrate, theactual placement of the pattern, the pattern-elements,and their features may differ from the expectedlocations, due to variations in equipment performanceand variations in substrate shape and dimensions.R1-2.3 Substrate Coordinate Systems (Unpatterned) A substrate coordinate system is a coordinate systemwhich has both origin and axes defined by the shapeand dimensions of the substrate and which does notdepend on whether there is a pattern on the substrate orwhether it is unpatterned. This coordinate system isused to locate or define sites relative to the substrate.R1-2.4 Substrate Pattern Coordinate System  Asubstrate pattern coordinate system is a coordinatesystem which has its origin and axes defined by thepattern as a whole on the substrate. This coordinatesystem is used to locate or to define sites relative to thepattern on the substrate. The expected or designedlocation of the pattern on the substrate can be defined interms of the placement of the origin and axes of thesubstrate pattern coordinate system relative to those ofthe substrate coordinate system. The actual location of apattern on a substrate may differ from the expectedlocation. The actual location is determined by locatingtwo or more alignment sites on the patterned substrate.The alignment sites are specific points of certainfeatures in the pattern. The coordinates of the alignmentsites are given in the substrate pattern coordinatesystem. In many cases, equipment does not align to thespecific pattern elements but instead uses the definedlocations of the pattern elements within the substratepattern coordinate system.R1-2.5 Pattern Element Coordinate System  Apattern-element coordinate system is a coordinatesystem which has its origin and axes defined by thepattern of one specific rectangular element in a pattern(a defined arrangement) of equal-sized rectangularelements. This coordinate system is used to locate or todefine sites relative to that specific pattern-element. Theexpected or designed location of the pattern-elementwithin a pattern can be defined in terms of theplacement of the origin and axes of the pattern-element coordinate system relative to those of the patterncoordinate system. The actual location of a pattern-element within a pattern on a substrate may differ fromthe expected location. The actual location is determinedby locating two or more alignment sites within thepattern-element. The coordinates of the alignment sitesare given in the pattern-element coordinate system.R1-2.6 Parallel Coordinate Systems  A secondcoordinate system is considered to be parallel to a firstcoordinate system if the origin of the second can bedefined as a translation from the origin of the first andif the axes of the second are parallel and in the samedirection as those of the first.R1-2.7 Requirements  The following is a list ofrequirements for ISEM equipment regarding coordinatesystems and reporting site locations:  ISEM equipment shall document whether it dealswith coordinate systems based on (a) a substrate,(b) a substrate pattern, or (c) a pattern-element orwhether it deals with several of these coordinatesystems. ISEM equipment shall establish a substratecoordinate system using a standard, documentedmethod. This coordinate system is not based on anypattern on the substrate. This coordinate systemshall be a right-hand Cartesian coordinate systemand shall be identified by a name.NOTE: For wafers, this method is defined in SEMI M20(Specification for Establishing a Wafer CoordinateSystem), and the coordinate system is named M20.  For equipment dealing with substrate patterncoordinates, the substrate pattern coordinate systemshall be established in a standard, documentedmethod relative to the substrate coordinate system(the unpatterned coordinate system). Thissubstrate pattern coordinate system shall be a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system and shall bedesigned to be parallel to the substrate coordinatesystem. The substrate pattern coordinate systemshall be identified by a name. The location of itsorigin and axes relative to the substrate coordinatesystem shall be communicated in terms of thesubstrate coordinate system.NOTE: For wafers, this method is the one describedbelow, and the substrate pattern coordinate system isnamed M20P, and its origin and axis relative to theSEMI M20 coordinate system are given in terms ofM20 coordinates and are communicated usingXlateData.  For equipment dealing with pattern-elementcoordinates, the pattern-element coordinate systemshall be established in a standard, documented

SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 200041 method relative either to the substrate patterncoordinate system or to another pattern-elementcoordinate system. The pattern-element coordinatesystem shall be a right-hand Cartesian coordinatesystem which is designed to be parallel to thesubstrate pattern coordinate system. The pattern-element coordinate system shall be identified by aname. The location of its origin and axis relative tothe substrate pattern coordinate system shall becommunicated in terms of the substrate patterncoordinate system.NOTE: For wafers, this method is based on SEMI M21,and the coordinate system is named M21 and its originand axis relative to the M20P coordinate system aregiven in terms of the M20P coordinates.  ISEM requires that equipment have the capabilityto use site location information that is based on theusers product designs, which the user shallprovide in the appropriate ISEM-required format. ISEM-compliant equipment shall have thecapability to define, locate, and report siteinformation using only the ISEM-defined right-handed Cartesian coordinate system formats. Thisrequirement does not preclude equipment fromhaving additional capability for defining orreporting site location information using otherformats. Coordinate system name and placement relative tothe higher coordinate system shall be defined andcommunicated using the following ISEM dataitems, in terms of either expected or actualplacement: CoordSys, XlateData, and theirincluded data items. Alignment site information shall be defined andcommunicated using the following ISEM items:the variable item AlignList, the ALIGNLIST, theProcess program class of TABLE-ALIGN-DEF,and their included information. Areas to be inspected shall be reported using thespecific coordinate system defined by the user. Thefollowing ISEM items are used to define andcommunicate area locations: the variable itemAREALIST, the AREALIST, and the Processprogram class of TABLE-AREA-DEF, and theirincluded information. The displacement of an actual coordinate systemrelative to its expected location shall becommunicated using the ISEM data item:XlateData and its included data items. The displacement of an actual site location relativeto its expected site location shall be communicated using the ISEM data item: Offset and its includeddata items. The equipment vendor shall document therequirements for the ISEM data items used inalignment of a coordinate system. The equipment vendor shall provide and documenta means for the user to define and communicate apattern map using SEMI M21 data. A pattern mapdefines the layout of equal-sized rectangularpattern-elements which make up a pattern. Eachpattern-element shall have a name, using the SEMIM21 naming convention.NOTE: For patterned wafers, the naming method shallbe that described in SEMI M21, and the pattern-elementinformation shall be communicated using the ISEM dataitem of SEMI M21Data.  For ISEM compliance, inspection equipment shallreport various anomaly data; AnomalyID,coordinates, and attributes. Review equipment shallreceive this data for anomalies and be able to locatethem and perhaps modify the coordinates.Anomaly coordinates shall be reported using ISEMtable named TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF and itsincluded data. R1-3 Coordinate System for a SubstrateR1-3.1 SEMI M20 Coordinate System  The SEMIM20 standard (Specification for Establishing a WaferCoordinate System) describes how to map a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system to a substrate sothat its origin is at the center of the substrate, and itsnegative y-axis bisects the substrates primary fiducial.This coordinate system is defined by ISEM to be theM20 coordinate system. The only informationrequired by equipment in order to establish an M20coordinate system is the substrate size and the type offiducial, which are communicated using the ISEM dataitems named SubstrateSize and Fiducial. AnotherISEM data item named Orientation identifies how thesubstrate is loaded on the equipment. Note that theSEMI M20 standard requires that the M20 coordinatesystem is fixed on the substrate and is not affected byhow the substrate is loaded on equipment. Also, asstated in the SEMI M20 standard, an orientation of 0degrees designates a substrate loaded on equipment,with the primary fiducial towards the operator ordown.R1-3.2 M20P Coordinate System  ISEM defines theM20P coordinate system to be one which is aligned tothe pattern on the substrate. The M20P coordinatesystem is useful because in many cases, it is moresignificant to the user to know the location of ananomaly relative to the pattern on the substrate rather

&lt;!-- Page 17 --&gt;

SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 2000 42 than relative to the substrate shape and dimensions.ISEM also defines the M20P coordinate system to beone which is designed to be parallel to the SEMI M20coordinate system. In practice, because of experimentalerrors, both the origins and the axes may differ slightlyfrom their intended values of a simple translation andno rotation. Equipment should be designed to be able tolocate the alignment sites, given the various possibleexperimental errors.R1-3.3 Establishing an M20P Coordinate System  Aminimum of two alignment sites is necessary toestablish an M20P coordinate system on a substrate.Additional sites are often used to determine a scalingratio of the dimensions of the actual coordinate systemrelative to the dimensions of the expected coordinatesystem and are reported using the ISEM data item ofScaleFactor.XlateData is used to report actual coordinate systemlocation. Most equipment cannot distinguish whetherpatterned substrate site location errors are due to thesubstrate, the layout on the substrate, or theequipments ability to locate the sites. However,information that is available through the use ofpatterned-substrate alignment sites can provide a meansfor identifying potential equipment problems. Forinstance, assume that the only pattern-layout locationerror on a substrate is that due to the establishment ofthe location of the substrate center and fiducial. Formany users and equipment systems, this is a goodassumption. If this is the case, then the ISEM data itemnamed XlateData can be used to track this error.Although the error may result from multiple sources,being able to track it on various equipment will enableusers to apply statistical process control techniques toidentify the specific sources.Offset sites may be found by equipment at actuallocations which deviate from their expected locationsthrough either pattern layout errors or equipmentstage or imaging errors. Again, in a controlledmanufacturing process, these combined errors shouldbe normally distributed, and non-normal deviationsmay indicate possible equipment problems. The actualposition of a site relative to its expected position shallbe reported through the use of the ISEM data itemnamed Offset. R1-4 Layout of Rectangular Pattern Elementson a Substrate Using SEMI M20 CoordinateSystemEquipment shall be capable of routine, automatedoperation without needing substrate layout information(e.g., field or die maps). However, having the capabilityto provide substrate layout information to equipment from the host can be desirable. ISEM defines a meansto do this in this section for substrates, based on SEMIM21 (Specification for Assigning Addresses toRectangular Elements in a Cartesian Array.) The SEMIM21 standard is limited to defining how to assignaddresses to elements and how to find the arraycenter element. It does not specify how the rectangularpattern-elements are located on the substrate. In thissection, ISEM defines how these pattern-elements arelocated on a substrate, using the data item namedM21Data, and how to establish within-elementcoordinate systems. Any additional layout information,such as within-element structure details or elementattribute information, is beyond the scope of ISEM.R1-4.1 ISEM M21 Layouts  An M21 layout consists of an array of equal-sized rectangular pattern-elements with no spacebetween the pattern elements. ISEM defines the M21 layout on a substrate toinclude all pattern-elements which are eitherwholly or partially within the circumference of thesubstrate. The ISEM approach is to define the pattern map byspecifying the M20P coordinate for the lower leftcorner of the minimum number of pattern-elementsneeded to define the layout, along with the pattern-element addresses (names). For a non-tiled layout,the location and name of a single pattern-element issufficient to establish the M21 layout. For tiledlayouts, the location and name of one pattern-element in each row or column are required. Notethat the location of the lower left corner of somepattern-elements may be outside the circumferenceof the substrate. The M21 pattern-element coordinate systemshall have its x and y axes parallel to the respectiveM20P coordinate system axes and shall have theirorigins at the lower left corner of each element.The pattern-element coordinate system shall have aname and a specific pattern-element addressidentifier per SEMI M21. Layout definition is supported only for host-to-equipment communications. The user isresponsible for ensuring that the pattern-elementaddresses provided to the equipment agree with theSEMI M21 specification. The equipment need notcheck this, other than to ensure that there are notconflicts within the provided layout, and shallreport results with pattern-element addresses asprovided by the user.

&lt;!-- Page 18 --&gt;

SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 200043  M21 layouts are established within the M20P coordinate system and need not require any additionalalignment site data than is needed to establish the M20P coordinate system. However, as with M20P, additionalalignment may be necessary because of errors in either the pattern layout or the equipments ability to locatefeatures. Offset shall be used to report the location corrections that result from any within-element alignments. R1-5 How an M20P Coordinate System Is Established on a SubstrateThe following example is fairly basic. For this example, the M20P coordinate system has a zero translation from theSEMI M20 coordinate system. Also, the equipment documentation states that 4 alignment sites are required. Theequipment does M20P alignment on two alignment sites and does a low resolution and then a high resolutionalignment at each site. Note that the specific alignment point is different at the two resolutions, so the coordinatesare slightly different. The alignment sites are defined to the equipment via the process program class namedTABLE-ALIGN-DEF, as detailed below. The order of the sites in TABLE-ALIGN-DEF is not important. Thesites are then selected via the CPNAME named ALIGNLIST, which is included in the PP-SELECT command.The order of the sites listed in ALIGNLIST is important and is as-specified in the equipments documentation.The first item is the alignment site for the first low resolution site, the second item is for the first high resolution site,the third item is the second low resolution site, and the fourth is the second high resolution site.TABLE-ALIGN-DEF AlignName Coordx Coordy Coordsys Attribute (1)Coarse1 -60000 -200 M20PFine1 -60020 -205 M20PCoarse2 +60000 +200 M20PFine2 +59980 +195 M20P ALIGNNAMEL,41. 2\. 3\. 4\. Using this information, the equipment will go to the nominal M20 location for Coarse1, then find where itactually is. The offset between the nominal M20 location and the actual M20 location is then used to findFine1. The actual M20 location of Fine1 is saved. The process is then repeated for Coarse2 and Fine2. Theequipment can now determine the M20 to M20P offset from the nominal and actual coordinates. First, a summaryof the data:xN1 = -60020 yN1 = -205 Nominal x and y data for the first fine sitexA1 = -59800 yA1 = -150 Actual x and y data for the first fine sitexN2 = +59980 yN2 = +195 Nominal x and y data for the second fine sitexA2 = +60060 yA2 = +175 Actual x and y data for the second fine site

SEMI 30.1-0200 © SEMI 1998, 2000 44 The equipment first calculates Theta, using, forexample, the formula:  = tan1 MA  MN1+ MA MNwhere MA and MN are, respectively, the slopes of thelines connecting the two actual fine sites and the lineconnecting the two nominal sites, in M20coordinates, calculated as follows: MA = yA2  yA1xA2  xA1 MN = yN2  yN1xN2  xN1 The equipment then calculates DeltaX and DeltaY,using, for example, the formulas: DeltaX = Csin ( ) + Dcos ( )sin ( )( )2+ cos ( )( )2 DeltaY = Csin ( )  D cos ( )sin ( )( )2+ cos ( )( )2 where C and D, the adjusted site 1 coordinates in arotation-adjusted coordinate system, are calculated,for example, using the formulas:C = yA1  ((xN1 sin) + ((yN1 cos)D = xA1  ((xN1 cos)  ((yN1 sin)The equipment can also calculate a ScaleFactor termto indicate the relative ratio between the length of thevector connecting the nominal alignment sites and thelength of the vector connecting the actual alignmentsites. This can be used, for example, to judge whetherthere is a problem with the alignment process, sincethe difference between these two vectors should besmall. ScaleFactor = VAVNwhere VA and VN are the length of the vectorsconnecting the actual and nominal alignment sites,calculated using the formulas: VN = yN2  yN1( )2 + xN2  xN1( )2 VA = yA2  yA1( )2 + xA2  xA1( )2

Rather, these notes describe possible methods for implementing certain ISEM requirementsdescribed by the standard and are included as reference material. R2-1 Using ISEM Table Attributes to Specify Process Related Data Item Variable ValuesR2-1.1 Section 11.1 (ISEM Table Data) allows the host to use ISEM Table attributes to specify product and processrelated information related to the table data. The ISEM Variable Item Dictionary (Table 4) includes seven data itemsintended to be used for this purpose. They are identified with the comment This information may be added by thehost in the ISEM Tables. Identifying the value of variable data items in Table attributes is not covered in use ofISEM Tables. One method to accomplish this is to use attribute identifiers (ATTRIDn) that are the same identifiersthat are used for the equipment variable data items (Table R2-1). (This is very similar to the method specified inSection 12.5 to identify values to override the default values of variable process program parameters using the PP-SELECT remote commands).

See SEMI E30 and OtherReferences section for additional information on statecharts general rules and utilization.7.2 Processing State Model Requirements  TheProcessing state model is required to be implemented asdefined in the next sections of this document. A statemodel consists of the following: state model diagram,state definitions and a state transition table. A statemodel represents the host's view of the equipment, notnecessarily the actual equipment operation. All MSEMstate model transitions shall be mapped sequentiallyinto the appropriate actual equipment events that satisfythe requirements of those transitions. In certainimplementations, the equipment may enter a state andhave already satisfied all of the conditions required bythe MSEM state model for transition to another state.The equipment makes the required transition withoutany additional actions in this situation.7.3 Some equipment may need to include additionalstates. Additional states may be added, but shall notchange the MSEM defined state transitions. Allexpected transitions between MSEM states must occur.

Valuesof these variables shall be available to the host via collection event reports and host status queries.9.2 Requirement all generic variable data items defined in SEMI E30 are required by all Measurementequipment. Data item variables are categorized as follows: 9.2.1 Common Variables (CV)  variables common to all equipment of the class being addressed. These variablesare covered in Table 4 and must be used to regardless of the measurement tool type.9.2.2 Configuration-specific variables (CSV)  variables associated with a specific configuration of the aboveequipment class.

&lt;!-- Page 33 --&gt;

SEMI E30.5-0302 © SEMI 2001, 200211 9.2.2.1 The following rules should be adhered to in the reporting of these variables. The information should be sent using the corresponding formats defined on Table 4 and 5. For ASCII variables A\[n\]. If the actual data does not fill the entire field, blanks shall be used to complete thefield. For ASCII variables A\[1..n\]. All fields should be left justified.9.3 Since MSEM is generic to all equipment it tries not to specify the names of the measurement variables to besent to the host. MSEM does require that the data be reported at site, wafer and lot levels. It should include theoption of reporting data at the individual scan level if supported by the equipment. It is a requirement that theequipment report at least: max, min, mean, standard deviation. Additional statistic calculations may be added by theequipment supplier. For each type of data collected by the equipment at the site level; the data must be summarizedand available for reporting at the wafer and lot levels.9.4 The following rules should be applied when reporting measurement values taken by the tool. The rules specifythe units to be used whenever these values are reported. All values specified should be reported in floating point format. All critical dimensions (lines and spaces) should be in microns. All overlay measurements should be in microns. All FTIR transmittance values and corresponding wavelengths should be reported in percent units and microns,respectively. All film stress values should be reported in teradynes/cm-cm. All resistivity measurements should be reported in Ohm-cm. All film thickness measurements should be reported in Angstroms.9.5 Data item variables should be documented in the MSEM data item variable dictionary using the followingformat: Variable Name Category Description Class Format Comments Where:Variable Name: A unique name for the data item variable (this name is for reference only).Category: Defined as Common or Configuration-Specific variables.Description: If class is DVVAL, then the description must contain a statement of when datais valid in terms of MSEM events.Class: Data type of the item.Format: Acceptable formats are SEMI E5 lists, ASCII, floating point, unsigned integer orsigned integer. A description of ANY, indicates that any of the above formatsare acceptable and is left to the tool vendor to decide. When required use SECSMessage Language format.Comments: Any additional information pertinent to the variable name. 9.6 Data Item Variable Types 9.6.1 Equipment Constants (ECV)  can be changed by the host using S2F15. The operator may have the ability tochange some of the values, but the equipment does not change the values on its own. The value of the equipmentconstant may be queried by the host at any time using the S2F13/14 transaction.

SEMI E30.5-0302 © SEMI 2001, 200215 10 Alarm List10.1 Since each model of equipment differs inconfiguration, it is not practical to provide anexhaustive list of all possible alarms. Instead, theMSEM is requiring the two tables provided asdescribed in SEMI E30 (Document Section). AlarmList Table which is intended to provide for equipmentconfiguration specific alarms and Alarm ID, AlarmSet/Cleared Event Table.10.2 Alarm List Table10.2.1 The alarm list table contains examples of alarmsthat pertain to various configurational aspects ofequipment. These examples are intended to illustratethat alarms pertain to situations in which there exists apotential for exceeding physical safety limits associatedwith people, equipment, and material being processedas per the SEMI E30 definition of an alarm. See SEMIE30 for further reference.10.3 Alarm ID, Alarm Set/Cleared Event Table10.3.1 The Alarm ID, Alarm Set/Cleared Event tabledocuments the association of each ALID to a set andcleared event as required by SEMI E30. See SEMI E30for further reference. 11 Process Program Management11.1 Requirements The MSEM requires that theSEMI E30 capability of Process Program Managementbe fully supported for this class of equipment. TheMSEM is also requiring that the Process Program havea structure that enables the user to build ProcessPrograms with default conditions that can be overriddenfor a run. MSEM is requiring the ability to vary; thequantity of substrates measured, the alignmentinformation used and the number and/or location of thesites to be measured through the uses of ProcessProgram variable parameters. The concepts of ProcessProgram Structure and Process Program variableparameters are discussed in the following sections. 11.2 Process Program Structure 11.2.1 Definition and Rules for Process ProgramsA Process Program contains information and/orinstructions required for the metrology equipment toprocess a given run of material. Equipment constantscan be used to supplement the information contained ina Process Program. 11.2.1.1 The Process Program shall supply all of theinformation required for a remotely executed run to beprocessed without operator intervention. Anyinformation that is normally requested from the operator console in manual operation shall have defaultvalues assigned in the body of the Process Program.11.2.1.2 Process-program parameters are used to tailora specific run of material and do not permanentlymodify the Process Program. They will remain ineffect only until the next run or until the next PP-UPDATE or PP-SELECT, PP-ASSIGN remotecommand.11.2.1.3 MSEM is requiring the ability to definespecific Process Program variable parameters to; definewhat substrates are to be measured (Process SlotList),what sites are to be measured (SiteList or M21SiteList)and what aligns are used by the Process Program(AlignList or M21AlignList). If the MSEM equipmentis using the SEMI M21 coordinate system then anadditional Process Program variable parameter isrequired what elements are to be measured(ElementList).11.2.2 Definition of Process Program VariableParameters A process-program parameter specifiesa value that temporarily modifies the value of a variableparameter in a Process Program. A variable parameteris formally defined within a process-program body andcontains:  a variable parameter name that is unique in thebody a parameter initial value, known as default value,for use when the Process Program is selected forexecution without specification of an overridevalue for this variable parameter.11.2.3 The Equipment may also support the definitionincluding: a parameter restriction that represents one or moreconditions that any value specified for theparameter must satisfy. a CP-NAME in a remote command must beidentical to a variable parameter name in theProcess Program specified in the remote command.If the Equipment allows Sub-process Programs, aSub-process Program reference may also specifyparameters.11.2.4 Relationship of Process Program VariableParameter The PP-SELECT, PP-ASSIGN or PP-UPDATE remote commands can be used to modifyvariables within the Process Program. Themodification to process-program variables is done byusing CP-NAME/CP-VAL pairs within the command.

SEMI E30.5-0302 © SEMI 2001, 2002 16 11.2.5 Sub-Process Programs Equipment may allow a main Process Program to reference Sub-processPrograms. A main Process Program is one that can be referenced by the host. A Sub-process Program is a ProcessProgram that is referenced by a main Process Program or by other Sub-process Programs. No Sub-process Programmay reference its main Process Program. If the Equipment supports sub-process-program references, it must bepossible for the host to determine which Sub-process Programs are referenced in all Process Programs. 11.2.5.1 Before execution of a main Process Program can begin, the presence of all the Sub-process Programs that itreferences must be verified by the Equipment. If they are not all present, an error collection event must occur. Itmust be possible to include in the event report which Sub-process Programs are missing. For a formatted ProcessProgram, the error is reported using an S7F27 message.11.2.6 Component Descriptions and Allowed FormatsTable 6 Process Program Component Description and Format TableComponent Name Description Format CommentsALIGN-ATTRIBUTE(n)Tool specific information associated withalignment site for which no specific MSEMdata item has been defined.

Theequipment suppliershall document all attributesthat are supported.SITENAME A unique identifier for a site. A\[1..16\] 11.2.7 DEF-LIST-TABLE Description DEF-LIST types of tables are used by the equipment in conjunction withthe Process Programs. The DEF-LIST table structures provide a means to transfer to equipment a list of a particulartype of information. The DEF-LIST table structures are used by the host to send information to equipment for lateruse in association with a Process Program. Each DEF-LIST that is sent has a unique Table name and each listelement in the DEF-LIST has several components including a name (Site-Name, or Align-Name) as well as othercomponents. A specific list row can be accessed for use with a specific Process Program by giving the DEF-LISTtable name and the specific row name.

&lt;!-- Page 39 --&gt;

SEMI E30.5-0302 © SEMI 2001, 200217 11.2.7.1 There are five types of DEF-LIST tables: SITE-DEF-LIST: A list of Sites and their attributes, typically the list of sites to be measured. ALIGN-DEF-LIST: A list of alignment sites and their attributes. M21-ELEMENT-DEF-LIST: A list of element ID and their low left hand location in M20P or SEMI M20coordinates. M21-ELEMENT-SITE-DEF-LIST: A list of ElementID's and what sites are to be measured within that element. M21-ELEMENT-ALIGN-DEF-LIST: a list of ElementID's and the alignment sites to be used at each.NOTE 2: The attributes are equipment-defined.11.2.7.2 To support the SiteList, and AlignList, for SEMI M20, M20P and SEMI M21, the following types of tablesmust be implemented: SITE-DEF-LIST, ALIGN-DEF-LIST, or M21-ELEMENT-SITE- DEF-LIST, M21-ELEMENT-ALIGN-DEF-LIST and M21-ELEMENT-DEF-LIST. A host would send a DEF-LIST to equipmentusing standard transfer methods for tables as defined by ARAMS (SEMI E58). MSEM requires that the followingcolumns be included in the DEF-LIST tables. The DEF-LIST-TABLE components table defines the DEF-LISTcolumn names and their allowable format is given below.Table 7 SITE-DEF-LISTSitename Coordx Coordy Coordsys Site- Attribute(n) 11.2.7.3 For SEMI M21 Coordinate system an additional table is required.

SEMI E30.5-0302 © SEMI 2001, 2002 18 12 Remote Commands12.1 The purpose of this section is to identify theMSEM required remote commands, commandparameters, and valid commands versus MSEM states.12.2 Requirements The following capabilities arerequired: StartProcessing Stop Processing Temporaly Suspend Processing Resume Processing Abort Processing Select Process Programs, Material and/or Sites toMeasure Report Location of Material Found within acassette12.3 All the remote commands defined by MSEM arerequired unless they have been qualified by thestatement if the equipment supports this functionalityit shall use this command. Then, they are only requiredif the equipment supports the functionality necessary tosupport the command. A good example of this is theMAP-CASSETTE command if the equipment does nothave the hardware necessary to scan a cassette for thepresence of substrates in slots then the command is notrequired by the MSEM. The alphanumeric stringsdefined by MSEM for RCMD and CPNAME arerequired.12.4 Definitions12.4.1 Host Command Parameter (CPNAME/CPVAL) a parameter name/value associated with a particularhost command (S2,F49). This document will specifyunique names (CPNAMEs) and values (CPVALs) formany command parameters. Note that if there are noassociated parameters a zero-length list is sent.12.5 Remote Commands Description  this sectiondescribes required functionality, suppliers mayimplement additional commands. The following remotecommands (RCMDs) must be supported as describedbelow.NOTE 2: The terms current cycle and safe point usedbelow are to be defined by the supplier.12.5.1 ABORT  terminate the current cycle prior toits completion. Abort has the intent of immediatelystopping the process and is used because of abnormalconditions. Abort makes no guarantee about thesubsequent condition of material except as noted in theCPNAME ABORT-LEVEL description. 12.5.2 CLEANUP Process Program deselection,removal of all material to output locations and anyequipment specific activities needed to transition intothe IDLE state. Completion of this command shouldgenerate a collection event report.12.5.3 NEXT-MATERIAL processing of the currentsubstrate is halted at the first safe point and unloaded tothe target cassette location. Next-material has the intentof allowing the host to skip measurement of the currentsubstrate. This is a trigger for processing statetransition from WORKING to UNLOAD.12.5.4 PAUSE suspend processing temporarily atthe next safe point. Pause has the intent of resumingthe process at the same point where it was paused.RESUME or PP-UPDATE may be used to resume theprocess.12.5.5 PP-ASSIGN instructs the equipment to assigna process to a carrier ID(s)/location(s) and place theexchange station in the process queue with the givenpriority. Only one assignment is allowed for a exchangestation. Without specifying a priority, the material isqueued with the default priority. Material with equalpriority are queued in the order the PP-ASSIGNcommands are received. If the equipment supports thefunctionality of queuing material, it will use thiscommand.12.5.6 PP-SELECT instructs the equipment to makethe requested Process Program(s) available in theexecution area. Additionally, to reduce the number ofProcess Programs on the equipment, PP-SELECT maydefine the material to be measured, measurement sitelocations, and/or the information needed for sitealignment; default values shall be used if thisinformation is not specified. This is a trigger for theprocessing state transition from IDLE to SETTING UP.All Process Programs specified in the command are tobe validated12.5.7 PP-UPDATE provides the ability to alterProcess Program variables during the PAUSEDprocessing state. Any CPNAMEs specified in PP-UPDATE will replace the previous definitions. Thiscommand will RESUME the process. If the PP-UPDATE fails, the Process Program variables presentprior to the PP-UPDATE are retained. If no parametersvalues are specified, the defaults are used.12.5.8 RESUME resume processing from the pointwhere the process was paused. This is the trigger forprocessing state transition 10, from PROCESS PAUSE.12.5.9 START instructs the equipment to initiateprocessing. This is the trigger for the processing statetransition from READY to LOAD.

SEMI E30.5-0302 © SEMI 2001, 2002 28 RELATED INFORMATION 1SEM UNIQUE CAPABILITIES NOTE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E30.5 and was derived from work developed in the MetrologySpecific Equipment Model Task Force in North America. This related information was approved for publication by full letterballot on April 30, 2001.R1-1. Measurement Site Location Metrologyequipment most often is used to make measurementsand report results at specific sites on a substrate.Unfortunately, equipment suppliers and users haveadopted different formats for describing measurementsite location information. This has led to threeproblems which increase the cost of metrology. First,metrology equipment suppliers must provide formatswhich meet conflicting requirements of their customers,adding to equipment development costs. Second, usersmust transpose information from different systems totheir own format in order to use metrology data. Third,site location information is often an integral part ofrecipe set up, often requiring that an actual productsample be available for training the site locationinformation on the equipment. For users whomanufacture many different products on commonsubstrates, multiple metrology recipes must bedeveloped where the only differences are site locationinformation. This information is known to the userfrom product design data, and should not need to be"learned" uniquely on various metrology equipment. R1-1.1 In order to avoid these problems, MSEMdefines specific formats for identifying and reportingsite location information on substrates. TheMSEM-required formats are intended to minimize thenumber and type of site location format transformationsneeding to be supported by both metrology equipmentsuppliers and users. All MSEM-required site locationformats involve the use of an MSEM-definedright-handed Cartesian coordinate system, establishedon substrates in an MSEM-defined manner. Thisrelease of MSEM defines these only for silicon wafersubstrates, based on SEMI standard M20. Additionalsubstrate types may be included in future revisions ofMSEM, if required. R1-1.2 MSEM requires that equipment have thecapability to use site location information that is basedon the user's product designs, which the user mustprovide in the appropriate MSEM-required format. Inother words, equipment shall not require that a samplesubstrate be used to train site locations when userscan provide this information from product design data. R1-1.3 MSEM-compliant equipment shall have thecapability to define, locate, measure, and report siteinformation using only the MSEM-defined right-handed Cartesian coordinate system formats. Thisrequirement does not preclude equipment from havingadditional capability for defining or reporting sitelocation information using other formats. One suchadditional format is defined in MSEM for patternedsilicon wafer substrates, based on SEMI standard SEMIM21. MSEM-compliant equipment is not required tohave this M21 format capability, but must use theMSEM M21 format if it is provided. R1-1.4 Specific MSEM information that defines sitelocation information includes ; the data items AlignListand SiteList; the CPNAMEs CP-ALIGNLIST andCP-SITELIST and the TABLE type named ALIGN-DEF-LIST and SITE-DEF-LIST. Notice that multiplesites can first be Defined using the appropriate ProcessProgram class named ALIGN-DEF-LIST or SITE-DEF-LIST, then selected by using the ALIGN-NAMEor SITENAME in an MSEM defined remote commandthat use CP-ALIGNLIST AND CP-SITELIST. Thisinformation is similarly defined for the M21coordinate system plus an additional CPNAME ofELEMENTLIST which lists the ElementIDs to bemeasured on the silicon wafers.R1-2 Coordinate Systems For A Silicon WaferR1-2.1 Requirements MSEM defines tworight-handed Cartesian coordinate systems for use onsilicon wafers. These are identified as the M20 andM20P coordinate systems. Both are based on SEMIstandard M20. The SEMI M20 standard describes howto map a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system to awafer so that its origin is at the center of the wafer, andits negative y-axis bisects the wafer's primary fiducial.This coordinate system is defined by MSEM to be theM20 coordinate system. MSEM defines the "M20P"coordinate systems to be one which is aligned to thepattern on the wafer. Ideally, there is no differencebetween the M20P and M20 coordinate system. Inthe real world, there is a difference, due to experimentalerrors. This is explained further in the followingsections.R1-2.2 Implementation The only informationrequired by equipment in order to establish an M20coordinate system is the wafer size and type of fiducial.This is provided by way of the MSEM data itemsnamed WaferSize and Fiducial. Another data itemnamed Orientation provides for control over how thewafer is loaded on equipment. Note that the SEMI
