The SECS-I protocol both predates the ISO/OSI\nmodel  and  is  not  a  true  "open  system"  and,  therefore,\ndoes not correspond exactly to the ISO/OSI model. The\nSECS-I  protocol  is  a  communications  interface  rather\nthan  a  network  protocol.  However,  the  SECS-I  levels\ncan  be  roughly  compared  to  layers  1  through  part  of\nlayer  5  of  the  ISO/OSI  model.  ISO/OSI  layer  1,  the\nphysical link layer, corresponds to the SECS-I physical\nlink.  ISO/OSI  layer  2,  the  data  link  layer,  corresponds\nto the SECS-I block transfer protocol. lSO/OSI layer 3,\nthe  network  layer,  is  a  function  of  the  host  and  is  not\ndefined  in  SECS-I  beyond  the  provision  for  a  bi-\ndirectional  flow  (see  Section  6.2).  Similarly,  network\nmanagement  is  assumed  to  be  the  responsbility  of  the\nhost. ISO/OSI layer 4, the transport layer, is covered by\nthe  SECS-I  block  transfer  protocol,  duplicate  block\ndetection,  and  the  message  protocol.  ISO/OSI  layer  5,\nthe  session  layer,  is  partially  covered  by  the  SECS-I\nmessage protocol.\nR1-1.2 Single Timer for T1 and T2 (see Section 5.3) \u2014\nA  single  timer  can  be  used  for  both  the  inter-character\ntimer  and  the  protocol  timer,  since  both  are  the  time\nbetween receiving successive characters and both limits\nare never in effect at the same time.\nR1-1.3 Stalling  (see  Section 5.8.2)  \u2014  The  line  control\nportion  of  the  block  transfer  protocol  has  the  ability  to\ndelay the acceptance of a data block by not responding\nwith an EOT immediately after receiving an ENQ. Such\nan  action  by  the  receiver  is  called  "Stalling."  If  the\ndelay  exceeds  the  sender\'s  T2  value,  the  sender  will\nsend  another  ENQ.  This  can  be  continued  depending\nupon the sender\'s setting of T2 and RTY. Such a delay\nshould  be  an  occasional  convenience  to  accommodate\nrandom short delays in the receiver\'s ability to accept a\nnew block and should not be counted upon routinely to\nmake  up  for  poor  response.  In  particular,  the  block\ntransfer  protocol  should  probably  have  at  least  two\nbuffers  available  for  storing  incoming  blocks.  This\nallows   one   block   to   be   inspected   by   the   message\nprotocol  while  the  next  block  is  being  received,  thus\nallowing  a  reasonably  continuous  reception  of  data.  If\nboth buffers are full and the message protocol is slow in\nfreeing  the  buffer  for  the  block  transfer  protocol,  then\nthe block transfer protocol will start stalling the sender.\nIf  the  sender  is  stalled  long  enough,  it  will  declare  a\nsend  error,  which  is  probably  the  correct  thing  to  do.\nThe  sender  cannot  distinguish  between  a  reluctance  to\nreceive  and  failure  in  the  communications.  In  either\nsituation,    since    no    block    gets    through    in    a\npredetermined  time  limit,  the  communications  link  is\neffectively   broken.   Arbitrarily   long   delays   are   not\nacceptable in SECS-I.\nR1-1.4 Determining  the  Cause  of  an  NAK  (see  Section\n5. 8.5) \u2014The block transfer protocol does not include a\nway for a sender to determine the cause of an NAK. If\nsuch  information  is  useful  for  application  purposes,  it\nmust be collected at the receiving end.\nR1-1.5 Master  Sending  a  Long  Message  (see  Section\n5. 8) \u2014When the master is sending a long message, the\nslave  may  be  unable  to  send  a  block,  which  may  result\nin   timeouts.   It   is   good   practice   for   the   master   to\nintroduce enough delay between blocks so that the slave\nhas a chance to send a block every few seconds.\nR1-1.6 Device   Identification   (see   Section 6.3) \u2014\nAlthough  the  15  bits  of  the  device  ID  can  identify\n32,767  different  devices,  the  host  may  find  it  more\nconvenient  to  use  the  upper  seven  bits  to  identify  the\ntype  of  device  such  as  a  spinner  or  diffusion  furnace,\nand  to  use  the  lower  eight  bits  to  identify  the  specific\ndevice of that type.\nR1-1.7 Sending  Multiple  Open  Messages  (see  Section\n7. 2.4)  \u2014The  message  protocol  algorithms  defined  in\nthe  standard  are  capable  of  inter-leaving  the  blocks  of\nany  number  of  open  multi-block  messages.  Since  the\nreceiving  protocol  is  sensitive  to  the  time  between\nblocks  of  each  message  being  received,  it  is  proper\nprocedure   for   the   sending   algorithm   to   alternate\nbetween     messages     when     sending     blocks     from\ninterleaved multi-block messages.\nR1-1.8 Single  Timer  for  T3  and  T4  (see  Sections 7.3.2\nand 7.4.3) \u2014 For a given transaction, a single timer can\nbe  used  for  both  the  inter-block  timer  and  the  reply\ntimer,   since   both   are   the   time   between   receiving\nsuccessive  blocks  of  a  message,  and  both  limits  are\nnever in effect at the same time.'),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E4-0699 \xa9 SEMI 1980, 199914\nFigure R1-1\nRS-232 Isolation Example"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,'SEMI E4-0699 \xa9 SEMI 1980, 199915\nR1-2  Isolation\nR1-2.1  As  mentioned  in  Section  3.4,  the  standard  RS-\n232-C  line  does  not  provide  isolation  between  the\ngrounds of remote equipment and a central computer. It\nis   often   desirable   to   provide   isolation   to   minimize\ncommunications  errors  and  to  protect  equipment.  The\nfollowing  example  is  provided  here  to  illustrate  how\nsuch   an   isolation   might   be   provided   between   two\ndevices   using   RS-232-C,   while   at   the   same   time\nproviding  the  capability  to  drive  longer  lines.  This\ndescription  is  provided  for  information  only  and  is  not\npart of the standard.\nR1-2.2  Figure  R1-1  illustrates  a  possible  circuit  for\nisolation  which  provides  line  isolation  and  line  driving\ncapability. The two wires used to provide power to the\nremote  isolator  are  required  since  any  local  power\nsupply  would  have  the  same  isolation  problems  as  the\ndata   wires.   The   power   wires   also   eliminate   extra\nsupplies  at  every  terminal  or  remote  device.  There  are\nmany  other  possible  circuits.  This  example  has  been\nused successfully and works quite well at 9600 baud for\nlines less than 300 meters and illustrates the use of the\nvoltages on pins 18 and 25 as mentioned in 3.2.4.\nR1-3  Examples of Block Transfer Protocol\nR1-3.1  Figures  R1-2  and  R1-3  illustrate  some  simple\nmessage    interactions    between    the    host    and    the\nequipment. Figure R1-2 shows the handshake sequence\npossible to acquire the status of the equipment. Fig-ure\nR1-3 shows the sequence of events when both the host\nand the equipment try to send at the same time.\nFigure R1-2\nAsk for Status\nFigure R1-3\nContention Resolution\nR1-4    Use  of  Buffers  in  the  Block  Transfer\nProtocol\nR1-4.1  In the flow chart of the Block Transfer Protocol\n(Figure  2),  the  flow  chart  entry  "LISTEN"  implies  that\ncharacters  are  recognized  after  entering  the  given  state\nand  not  before.  If  the  particular  implementation  uses\nbuffers  and  stores  all  of  the  characters  received  before\nthe  "LISTEN"  state  is  achieved,  care  must  be  taken  in\nthe  proper  handling  of  the  data  in  the  buffer  to  avoid\nproblems  due  to  "timing  windows"  between  sending\nand receiving.\nR1-4.2    If  the  buffer  is  cleared  before  sending  the  last\ncharacter prior to the "LISTEN" (last checksum byte in\nsending a message, ENQ or EOT in line control), there\nis  still  a  time,  albeit  small,  where  spurious  characters\ncould be received into the buffer.\nR1-4.2.1      In   addition,   during   the   sending   of   the\nmessage, a delay between the checksum bytes while the\nbuffer  is  cleared  may  cause  an  inter-character  timeout\nby  the  receiver.  If  the  buffer  is  cleared  after  the  last\ncharacter   sent   before   the   "LISTEN,"   there   is   a\npossibility  that  the  desired  character  will  be  cleared\nfrom the buffer.\nR1-4.3    One  solution  is  to  look  at  the  buffer  after\nentering   the   "LISTEN"   state   and   examine   the   last\ncharacter  in  the  buffer,  if  any  are  there.  This  works\nwhile listening for an EOT after sending an ENQ. In the\ncase  where  the  sender  is  listening  for  an  ACK  after\nsending  the  second  checksum  byte,  it  is  possible  that\nthe  receiver  also  has  a  block  to  send,  and  follows  the'),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E4-0699 \xa9 SEMI 1980, 199916\nACK  immediately  with  an  ENQ.  In  this  case  the  last\ncharacter in the buffer might be an ENQ, and so the last\ntwo   characters   should   be   examined.   If   an   ACK\nprecedes  the  ENQ,  then  it  should  be  assumed  that  the\nblock  was  sent  successfully,  and  the  ENQ  should  be\nsaved for establishing line control (i.e., send an EOT, or\nan ENQ if there is contention).\nR1-4.4    The  handling  of  the  buffer  when  listening  for\nthe length byte is not improved by this suggestion. The\nbuffer should be cleared after the ENQ is received and\nbefore  the  EOT  is  sent.  Spurious  characters  received\nbefore the length byte will cause a send failure.\nFigure R1-4\nPossible Bock Header Structure\nR1-5  System Bytes\nR1-5.1    This  section  presents  a  sample  scheme  for\ngenerating  and  managing  the  system  bytes  field  of  the\nblock header. There are many possible implementations\nwhich  meet  the  requirements  of  SECS-I.  This  section\ndescribes one of those implementations.\nR1-5.2    Source  ID  and  Transaction  ID  \u2014  The  system\nbytes  are  divided  into  two  parts,  a  source  ID  and  a\ntransaction ID, as shown in Figure R1-4.\nR1-5.3      Distinct   source   IDs   are   assigned   to   each\napplication  level  originator  of  primary  messages  in  a\nhost or equipment. This allows a secondary message to\nbe  routed  to  the  source  of  the  corresponding  primary\nmessage  of  the  transaction.  The  transaction  ID  is  an\ninteger  that  is  incremented  for  each  primary  message\nsent  by  the  SECS-I  interface.  It  is  the  same  for  all\nblocks of a multi-block message.\nR1-5.4  Actions \u2014 When a SECS-II message is passed\nto  the  SECS-I  protocol,  the  least  significant  bit  of  the\nlower message ID is examined to determine whether the\nmessage is primary (bit 1 = 1) or secondary (bit 1 = 0)\nmessage.  If  the  message  is  primary,  transaction  ID  is\ngenerated  and  placed  in  the  transaction  ID  portion  of\nthe   system   bytes.   One   method   for   generating   the\ntransaction   ID   is   to   start   with   a   value   of   0   upon\ninitialization,   and   increment   by   1   for   each   new\ntransaction,  starting  with  1  (not  0)  when  the  largest\ntransaction  ID  value  has  been  used.  At  the  same  time,\nthe  application  sender's  source  ID  is  placed  in  the\nsource ID portion of the system bytes. If the message is\nsecondary, the system bytes are the same as those of the\ncorresponding  primary  message.  It  is  assumed  that  the\napplication generating the reply can identify the reply to\nthe message protocol, which has saved the system bytes\nfrom the primary message.\nR1-5.5    Block  Send  Failures  (see  Sections 5.8.2  and\n6. 8.1) \u2014 Since it is a requirement that the system bytes\nbe  distinct  from  those  used  in  blocks  that  were  not\nsuccessfully  sent  since  the  last  successful  block  send,\nthe  use  of  two  bytes  for  the  transaction  ID  would\neffectively satisfy the requirement by allowing for up to\n65,536 consecutive block send failures.\nR1-6  Using SECS in a Network\nR1-6.1    The  SECS  standard  can  be  used  to  control  the\nflow of data within a network of computers. A network\nis   an   interconnection   of   computers   or   intelligent\ncontrollers   communicating   with   one   another   over\ncommunications  lines.  Each  intelligent  entity  is  a  node\nof  the  network.  Each  node  may  have  a  number  of\nconnections to other members of the network.\nR1-6.2  One connection of equipment and computers is\nin  the  form  of  a  tree  network  with  the  processing\nequipment  at  the  ends  of  branches  as  shown  in  Figure\nR1-5.  Intermediate  Nodes  A  and  B  service  like  pieces\nof  equipment;  i.e.,  all  the  furnaces  to  Node  A,  all\nmasking to Node B, and so on, for more nodes.\nR1-6.3  Node A monitors the three stations 1A, 2A, and\n3A.  Node  A  handles  most  of  the  normal  requirements\nof  coordinating  1A,  2A,  and  3A.  Node  A  receives\ninstructions   from   Node   C   regarding   the   behavior\ndesired  from  1A,  2A,  and  3A.  A  CRT  or  operator\ninterface connected to Node A is shared by 1A, 2A, and\n3A. Any node can direct messages up or down the tree.\nA  message  such  as  an  alarm  can  be  sent  from  1A  to\nNode  A  and  from  Node  A  to  Node  C  which  might  be\nconsidered  the  host  of  the  network.  Node  A  might  be\npart  of  a  system  supplied  by  a  company  which  has  its\nown  communications  scheme  for  devices  tied  to  Node\nA. As long as the company provides one connection to\nNode  A  which  is  consistent  with  this  standard,  then"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E4-0699 \xa9 SEMI 1980, 199917\nNode A and its attached equipment can be connected to\nthe host, Node C, and collectively be called one node.\nFigure R1-5\nTree Network\nR1-6.4  This tree structure can be extended even further\nas    shown    in    Figure    R1-6    to    include    multiple\nmanufacturing  plants  at  remote  sites.  However,  the\nprimary   intent   of   this   standard   is   to   address   the\ncommunication  between  processing  equipment  and  a\nhost.  At  higher  levels  of  the  tree,  the  message  is\ncombined  with  more  system  level  messages  and  more\ncomputer   file   manipulations.   At   these   levels,   the\ncommunications  may  require  more  complex  or  higher\nspeed  standards.  Thus,  the  SECS  line  is  intended  to  be\nused  within  one  integrated  circuit  manufacturing  area\nrather  that  between  general  purpose  computer  centers,\nalthough  its  only  limitations  for  such  a  use  would  be\nspeed.\nFigure R1-6\nExtended Tree Network for a Large Organization\nR1-6.5    The  tree  network  is  characterized  by  the  fact\nthat  there  is  only  one  possible  path  between  any  two\nnodes  in  the  network.  This  feature  makes  handling\nmessages  in  the  tree  network  relatively  easy  when\ncompared    to    networks    where    more    than    one\ncommunication  path  exists  between  nodes.  In  these\nlatter  networks,  the  nodes  must  make  some  judgment\nabout   which   path   to   take,   perhaps   based   on   the\nconditions  of  the  lines  or  on  the  destination  of  the\nmessage.\nR1-6.6    The  device  ID  and  the  R  (Reply)  bit  play  an\nimportant  role  in  directing  messages  in  the  network.\nEach  node  of  the  three  maintains  a  table  of  the  device\nbelow  it.  From  the  device  code,  it  knows  on  which\nbranch to send the data. When a message is going from\nthe central node toward the device, the R-bit is set to 0.\nWhen  a  message  is  being  sent  from  the  device  up  the\ntree, the R-bit is set to 1. When a node sees the R-bit set\nto  1,  the  message  must  take  the  one  communication\ndirection that goes up the tree structure. Thus, the R-bit\nserves  to  direct  messages  up  the  tree  or  down  the  tree,\ndepending   on   its   value.   At   any   given   node,   this\nbehavior may be explained in Figure R1-7.\nFigure R1-7\nMessage Handling at a Node by Using the R-Bit\nR1-7  The General Node Transaction Protocol\nR1-7.1    The  transaction  protocol  has  three  primary\nfunctions.    First,    it    coordinates    the    receiving    of\nmessages  that  arrive  in  multiple  blocks.  Second,  it\nprovides   a   mechanism   for   matching   primary   and\nsecondary  messages.  Third,  it  does  error  detection  on\nincomplete  messages  whether  they  are  due  to  a  break\nduring multiple blocks or a lack of reply messages. The\nthird  function  is  vital  to  the  maintenance  of  a  working\nsystem,  as  can  be  seen  from  the  following  discussion.\nOnce  a  transaction  is  begun  with  the  first  block  of  a\nprimary message, the receiving machine will have some\nmemory    allocated    to    buffering    or    pointing    to\ninterpreting    modules.    If    the    transaction    remains\nincomplete  for  some  reasonable  length  of  time,  it  may"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,'SEMI E4-0699 \xa9 SEMI 1980, 199918\nbe assumed that an error has occurred and the receiving\nmachine  should  release  any  memory  it  may  be  holding\nfor the transaction. If memory were to remain allocated\nto  incomplete  transactions,  conceivably  the  receiving\nmachine could run out of available memory and would\nbe unable to function properly. For this reason, the error\ndetection of incomplete transactions is an essential part\nof the message transaction protocol in SECS-I.\nR1-7.2  The message transaction protocol is based on a\nsystem of timers called transaction timers. These timers\nare  maintained  in  software  and  are  associated  with  a\ngiven  transaction.  Once  a  transaction  is  begun,  there\nwill exist a timer on the time interval between all blocks\nof  the  transaction  independent  of  the  direction  of  the\nmessage.  The  machine  that  expects  to  receive  a  block\nhas the burden of timing and error detection. Timers are\nrequired  in  any  machine  that  (1)  makes  a  request  and\nexpects  to  receive  data  back;  (2)  must  receive  multiple\nblock   requests;   or   (3)   sends   data   and   expects   an\nacknowledgement.   A   machine   may   require   several\ntransaction timers if it can conduct multiple transactions\nat  one  time  on  one  port  or  has  multiple  ports.  A\nmessage  timer  will  exist  for  each  link  involved  in  the\ntransaction.  This  allows  the  error  detection  to  identify\nthe particular link which has failed.\nR1-7.3    A  general  algorithm  can  be  constructed  to\nhandle  an  arbitrary  number  of  SECS  ports.  Such  an\nalgorithm  is  presented  in  the  form  of  a  flow  chart  in\nFigure  R1-8.  There  is  one  such  algorithm  for  each\ndevice ID. The algorithm handles all SECS data blocks\nthat  enter,  leave  or  pass  the  device  ID.  A  new  block\ncauses  the  procedure  to  be  executed  starting  from  the\npoint  marked  "block  in"  and  continues  until  the  point\nmarked  "block  out."  The  block  of  data  will  then  be\ndirected to the proper destination.\nR1-7.4  This algorithm makes use of a stored version of\nthe message header for each transaction being handled.\nThe stored header may be visualized as shown in Figure\nR1-9.  The  stored  header  has  two  system  areas  and  an\nassociated  transaction  timer.  The  two  system  areas  are\nrequired to keep the incoming and the outgoing system\nareas  independent  in  coding,  yet  related  in  meaning.\nThe two system areas are referred to by the state of the\nR-bit  in  the  message  block  header.  One  area  is  related\nto R = 0 and the other R = l. When a prime message is\nreceived that requires a reply, the system bytes from the\nblock are stored in the system area corresponding to the\nopposite  state  of  the  R  bit  on  the  message.  When  the\nreply  is  sent,  the  system  bytes  are  used  from  the  store\nsystem  bytes  corresponding  to  the  same  R-bit  as  the\nreply. The system area corresponding to the same R-bit\nas  the  message  is  called  OUTSYS  while  the  system\narea   corresponding   to   the   opposite   R-bit   is   called\nINSYS.\nR1-7.5  When a block is presented to this algorithm, the\nfirst  task  is  to  determine  if  the  block  is  part  of  an\nongoing    transaction,    the    first    block    of    a    new\ntransaction,  or  some  other  unknown  block.  This  test  is\naccomplished  by  comparing  the  header  of  the  block\nwith the stored headers. If a match is not found, then a\ncheck is made to see if the block is the first of a primary\nmessage.  If  this  is  true,  then  a  new  header  is  added  to\nthe  stored  header  list.  If  the  primary  message  is  only\none  block  long  and  requires  no  reply,  then  no  stored\nheader is created. When a match is found, the algorithm\nmodifies  the  stored  header  so  that  it  will  look  like  the\nnext  block  of  the  transaction  to  be  expected.  On  all\nblocks  requiring  a  stored  header,  except  the  last,  a\ntransaction  timer  is  set  to  a  timeout  value  prior  to\nsending the block to its destination. The last part of the\nalgorithm  directs  the  block  to  its  destination  or  detects\nan error in the destination.\nR1-7.6   Error   recovery   is   an   important   part   of   the\nalgorithm   to   ensure   that   the   system   will   remain\noperational  in  spite  of  bad  data  blocks.  For  any  block\nthat  does  not  pass  the  tests  described  in  the  algorithm,\nthe header of the message is saved and sent in the host\ndirection on a Stream 9 error message. This information\ncan  be  useful  in  tracking  down  the  source  of  the  error.\nAnother   type   of   error   occurs   when   one   of   the\ntransaction  timers  times  out.  Such  an  error  message\nmeans  that  the  transaction  has  been  interrupted.  An\nerror  message  is  formed  which  sends  the  stored  header\nin the host direction on Stream 9. The stored header and\nthe  timer  are  then  released.  This  procedure  aids  in\nkeeping   software   cleared   and   ready   in   case   of\ndifficulties in the network.'),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E4-0699 \xa9 SEMI 1980, 199919\nFigure R1-8\nGeneral Node Transaction Algorithm"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E4-0699 \xa9 SEMI 1980, 199920\nRDevice ID\nDevice ID\nWSTREAM\nFUNCTION\nEBlock No.\nBlock No.\nS1(R=0)\nS2(R=0)\nS3(R=0)\nS4(R=0)\nS1(R=1)\nS2(R=1)\nS3(R=1)\nS4(R=1)\nTransaction Timer\nFigure R1-9\nStored Header Model\nNOTICE:  These  standards  do  not  purport  to  address\nsafety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  their  use.

For  compatibility  with  SECS-I,\nthe maximum length allowed for a single-block SECS-\nII message is 244 bytes.

In SECS-\nII,  messages  are  identified  by  a  stream  code  (0\u2013127,  7\nbits)   and   a   function   code   (0\u2013255,   8   bits).      Each\ncombination of stream and function represents a distinct\nmessage identification.\n6. 4.3  Reply    Requested    \u2014    The    message    transfer\nprotocol must be capable of identifying whether a reply\nis requested to a primary message.\n6. 5  Transaction  Timeout  \u2014  It  is  presumed  that  the\nmessage  transfer  protocol  will  notify  SECS-II  in  the\nevent  of  failure  to  receive  an  expected  reply  message\nwithin a specified transaction timeout period.\nNOTE 2:  In SECS-I, a transaction timeout occurs if either the\nreply timeout (T3) is exceeded before the first block of a reply\nmessage  is  received  or  if  the  inter-block  timeout  (T4)  is\nexceeded  before  an  expected  block  of  a  multi-block  message\nis received.\n6. 6  Multiple   Open   Transactions   \u2014   This   standard\nallows,  but  does  not  require,  the  support  of  more  than\none concurrent open transaction.\n7  Streams and Functions\n7. 1  Streams  \u2014  A  stream  is  a  category  of  messages\nintended to support similar or related activities.\n7. 2  Functions \u2014 A function is a specific message for a\nspecific activity within a stream.  All the functions used\nin   SECS-II   will   follow   a   numbering   convention\ncorresponding to primary and secondary message pairs.\nAll  primary  messages  will  be  given  an  odd-numbered\nfunction  code.    The  reply  message  function  code  is\ndetermined  by  adding  one  to  the  primary  message\nfunction  code.    The  even-numbered  function  following\na  primary  message  which  requests  no  reply  is  reserved\nand is not to be used.  Function code 0 is reserved in all\nstreams   for   aborting   transactions   as   described   in\nSection 10.4.\n7. 3  Stream  and  Function  Allocation \u2014 Some of the\nstream and function code combinations are reserved for\nthis   standard,   while   others   are   available   for   user\ndefinition.
