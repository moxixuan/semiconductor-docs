Application of thistest method is expected to yield comparable resultsamong components tested for the purposes ofqualification for this installation.1.2 This document defines a meth od of testing theinterior surfaces of stainless steel tubing, fittings,valves, and other components to determine the surfacecomposition and chemistry, as a measure of theeffectiveness of passivation processes.1.3 The objective of this method is to describe ageneral set of instrument parameters and conditions thatwill achieve precise and reproducible measurements ofimportant surface chemistry within the chromium-enriched oxide layer. 2 Scope2.1 This document describes a test method tocharacterize as received surface composition andchemistry encompassing all chromium-enrichedstainless steel surfaces in tubing, fittings, valves, andother components. This procedure involvesmeasurement of total Cr/Fe ratios, Cr ox/Fe ox oxidespecies ratios, and the surface elemental compositionsby Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis(ESCA), also called X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy(XPS).2.2 This document also describes the test method for acompositional ESCA depth profile measurement for Cr,Fe, Ni, O and C from the as-received surface, throughthe oxide layers, and extending into the base metal.The depth profile measurement evaluates the oxidethickness and the relative composition throughout themodified surface layer as a result of the passivationprocess.2.3 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This test method is intended to be used by ESCAanalysts familiar with the instrumentation andtechnique. The ESCA instrument must be calibratedand maintained to pertinent manufacturersspecifications. The method is not intended to precludethe use of any particular brand or model of surfaceanalysis equipment. While most of the testmethodology has been developed using specificinstrumentation, this method can be adapted to mostsurface analytical instrumentation.3.2 The effects of the depth of ana lysis of thetechnique and surface contamination affect the resultsof this test method. These are discussed in the attachedappendix.

Any samplepreparation shall avoid introducing contamination ontothe surface to be measured. In addition, preparationmust avoid excessive heating of the sample, i.e., thesurface temperature shall not exceed 50 oC, to avoidoxide growth or change in surface composition.11.2 Sample preparation should pre ferably be done bythe component manufacturer. Following sectioning thesample(s) are to be cleaned and packaged per themanufacturers standard final cleaning and packagingprocedures.11.3 If sample preparation is done b y other than themanufacturer, the sample(s) may be cleaned in DIwater.

The instrument vacuumshall be 1.0E-7 Torr or better during the analysis. 13 Calibration and Standardi zation13.1 Proper instrument calibration i s necessary toprovide the most accurate and reproducible results,particularly if results are compared among differentlaboratories. Instrument calibration for sensitivityfactors and binding energies shall be performed inaccordance with the instrument manufacturerrecommendations or other accepted method, such asthat provided in ASTM E902.13.2 The general ESCA calibration proceduresdescribed above are suitable for most analyses andprovide reasonably accurate relative quantitativeinformation regarding the surface chemistry. However,in order to establish the most accurate measurementpractical and to maintain the desired level ofreproducibility over time, an application-specificstatistical process control (SPC) shall be established forthis test method to determine the appropriate sensitivityfactors for Cr, Fe, Ni and Mo in 316L stainless steel.The bulk composition of the SPC material should havean assay consistent with the acceptable compositionrange of 316L for Cr, Fe, Ni and Mo, as set forth inASTM A276.

Some ofthese practices are detailed in ASTM-E1078. The areato be analyzed should be mounted parallel to the sampleholder surface so that TOA is well known.14.1.1 Place the sample in the ESCA introductionchamber for pump down. Transfer to the analyticalchamber at the manufacturer's recommended basepressure. Align the sample with respect to the X-raybeam and analyzer so that optimum count rate from thedesired analytical location is obtained. The use of acollimated high voltage electron beam to align thesample should be avoided, as this may pyrolyze surfacecarbon and potentially alter surface oxide chemistry.The surface area to be analyzed should be free ofvisible particles and large defect features, if possible.14.1.2 A beam size as close to 1 mm as possibleshould be used to ensure measurement of arepresentative surface. If surface curvature is great (e.g., ","<",' 1/4" tubing), a smaller beam may be employed.Elemental survey data (01100 eV) are to be measuredfrom the sample surface to determine the elementspresent and their approximate surface abundance. Ahigh throughput analyzer setting may be used to obtaina signal to noise ratio (S/N) sufficient to detect commonsurface contaminants such as sulfur and phosphorus atone atomic percent or better.14.1.3 Using instrument settings suffi cient to providea FWHM peak width of 1.0 eV or less on Au (4f7/2),measure chromium, iron, and carbon regions. A typicalregion width is 20 eV. Suggested ranges are as follows:Cr (2p 3/2) from 570 to 590 eV, Fe (2p 3/2) from 700 to720 eV, and C (1s) from 275 to 295 eV. Signal to noiseratios of greater than 20 are suggested.14.1.4 A consistent method of data re duction of high-resolution surface spectra is necessary in order toprovide meaningful comparison of the relative Cr:Feratios.14.1.5 The spectra shall be charge co mpensated withrespect to the maximum of the Cr (2p 3/2) set to 577 eV.An iterated Shirley method of background subtractionshall be applied to the Fe (2p 3/2) and Cr (2p 3/2) spectralregions, using a minimum of three iterations.14.1.6 The curve fit regions shall typi cally extendfrom:Cr (2p 3/2) 570582 eVFe (2p 3/2) 704717 eV14.1.7 The curve fit peak parameters should beinitialized as follows: Cr (2p 3/2) Peak Position FWHM % gaussian1 574 1.5 802 576.5 2.0 803 577.5 2.0 80 Fe (2p 3/2) Peak Position FWHM % gaussian1 707 1.0 802 708 1.0 803 710 1.4 804 711.5 1.4 805 713 1.4 80 14.1.8 The curve fit routine should ap ply the followingtolerances for the band limit parameters of all peaksdefined above:FWHM delta \u2264 0.2 eV% gaussian delta \u2264 10%Curve fit position delta \u2264 0.25 eV 14.1.9 An automated form of data red uction isrecommended to enhance reproducibility and minimize'),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 9 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F60-0301 \xa9 SEMI 20015 analyst subjectivity associated with the curve fitprocedure.

The elementalcomposition should be calculated using sensitivityfactors appropriate to the instrument, each element, andresolution settings for each measurement.15.2 The total Cr/Fe ratio is calcula ted by adding peakareas from all species of each element, adjusting fordifferent numbers of scans and sensitivity factors, and dividing the Cr result by the Fe result. The Cr oxide/Fe oxide ratio is calculated in a similar manner, exceptthat only peaks 2 and 3 for Cr and only peaks 3 through5 for Fe (oxide species) are used. The formulas are asfollows:Total Cr/Fe = ( Cr peak areas)/# Cr scans/Cr sensitivity factor( Fe peak areas)/# Fe scans/Fe sensitivity factorCr Oxide/ = ( Cr oxide peak areas)/# Cr scans/Cr sens. factorFe Oxide ( Fe oxide peak areas)/# Fe scans/Fe sens. factor 16 Reporting Results16.1 As-Received Surface Results  A tabularsummary of the elemental composition of all elementsdetected in the surface survey spectrum is to besupplied with the associated elemental survey spectrum.If sample preparation has been done by other than thecomponent manufacturer all tables of as-receivedsurface analysis results shall include a note stating:Sample preparation was not performed by thecomponent manufacturer.

This appendix is derived from presentations made tothe SEMI Surface Analysis Task Force.A1-1.1 The purpose of this appendix is to describe theESCA (sometimes referred to as X-Ray PhotoelectronSpectroscopy (XPS)) technique and explain theinterpretation of the depth profile analysis with respectto the structure and composition of the passive oxidelayer on stainless steel. The effect of the depth ofanalysis on the measured chromium to iron ratio, theoxide thickness, and the depth of enrichment isdiscussed. The discussion applies to depth profileanalyses performed by Auger electron spectroscopy,also.A1-1.2 ESCA  The ESCA technique makes use of anX-ray beam for a probe. The surface of interest isilluminated with X-rays, typically Al k radiation,which has a well-defined energy of 1486.6 eV. Whenan x-ray photon and an electron interact, the electronadsorbs all of the energy of the photon, 1486.5 eV; itcannot react with it partially. The electron then hassufficient energy to leave the atom and move into thematrix. The electrons energy in the matrix is 1486.6eV minus its binding energy to the atom from which itescaped. Its binding energy is indicative of the elementor compound from which it came and the orbital fromwhich it was removed. Such an electron is termed aphotoelectron.A1-1.3 In a typical ESCA instrument, amonochromatic beam of x-rays is focused at a point ofinterest on a surface. A cloud of electrons is generatedat the surface by the x-rays. This electron cloud ismade up of secondary electrons, Auger electrons andphotoelectrons. (NOTE: The generation of Augerelectrons is a byproduct of the process. If thephotoelectron was an inner shell electron, when itleaves the atom it creates an ion in an excited state.Once the ion is created it can de-excite via the Augerprocess. The presence of Auger electrons in an ESCAsurvey can be used to determine what elements werepresent.) The mechanisms of ESCA photoelectron andAuger electron generation are illustrated in Figure A1-1. Figure A1-1Schematic representation of the ESCAphotoelectron and Auger electron generationprocesses. A1-1.4 An electron lens is focused at the same point asthe x-ray beam and a portion of the electron cloudenters the lens. From the lens, the electrons enter anelectron analyzer that measures the number of electronsas a function of their kinetic energy. The kinetic energyis subtracted from the incident x-ray photon energy, andthe resulting binding energy is then plotted as the x-axiswith the number of electrons at each energy on the y-axis. An example is shown in Figure A1-2. Thebinding energy can be indicative not only of theelement from which the electron came but also thechemical bonding state of the element."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 11 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F60-0301 \xa9 SEMI 20017 Figure A1-2Example of ESCA spectrum of the oxide passivesurface of stainless steel A1-1.5 Illuminated Volume and Surface Sensitivity The incident x-ray beam penetrates well below thesurface. Photoelectrons and Auger electrons aregenerated all through this illuminated volume. Theinelastic mean free path (IMFP) of an electron in a solidis the mean distance through the solid that an electroncan travel before losing some of its energy (suffering aninelastic interaction). The IMFP is a function of theelectrons energy and the matrix through which it istraveling. Electrons with an energy of approximately 1keV have an IMFP of about 10 . That means that a 1keV electron will travel, on average, 10  beforeinteracting with the matrix and giving up some of itsenergy. In other words it will be scattered to lowerenergy and will not be part of the photoelectron orAuger electron line for its element. The IMFP is astatistical parameter and an electron may travel severalIMFPs before having a collision. The several IMFPsis called the escape depth of the electron, or the depthof analysis, as shown in Figure A1-3. Although ESCAand Auger are considered surface analytical tools, theirdepth of analysis is on the order of 50 , or about oneto two times the depth of the oxide film found on atypical passivated stainless steel surface. Figure A1-3The electron escape depth of low energy electrons insome metals. A1-1.6 Depth of Analysis Function  There has beensome discussion with respect to the Depth of AnalysisFunction. There is one school that believes that it is 5IMFPs and another that uses 3 IMFPs. These twofunctions will be referred to as 5 and 3 respectively.It will be seen that it makes little difference whichfunction is used even though the depth of the oxidefilms is of the order of the functions. These functionsare seen in Figure A1-4, which shows the proportion ofthe total signal generated from each depth below thesurface. The y-axis is in decimal and the x-axis is inangstroms from the surface. The first point of the 5curve is 0.16 at the 1 st angstrom level. That means that16% of the signal comes from the 1 st angstrom, 14%from the 2 nd angstrom level and so on down to 1% fromthe 25 th angstrom level. Thus elements that do notappear on the surface or in the first 24 angstroms infrom the surface, but do exist at the 25  level will bedetected. trum Skip Auto by 10100200300400500600700800900100011000123456789 x 10 4 FCEPSSe1.spe Binding Energy (eV) c/s -O KLL-O KLL -Fe LMM-Fe2p3-Cr2p3 -O1s -N1s -C1s -P2s-P2p-Fe3s-Fe3p-Cr3p-Mo3d -Ni LMM -Ni3p -Ni2p3"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 12 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F60-0301 \xa9 SEMI 2001 8 5 Lambda 00.020.040.060.080.10.120.140.160.18 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25Angstroms3 Lambda 00.020.040.060.080.10.120.140.160.18 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25Angstroms Figure A1-4These two graphs represent the Depth of Analysisthat will be seen when analyzing 1 keV electrons.The top curve is the 5 curve and bottom the 3.

Most actualdepth profiles exhibit a maximum of the Cr:Fe ratio atsome depth below the initial surface, referred to as thedepth of maximum enrichment. This is a consequenceof variation in the actual composition of the oxide,possibly having a higher concentration of Fe near thesurface, a phenomenon commonly termed a detachediron oxide layer, or of contamination on the surface,generally hydrocarbons. These are discussed in thenext section.A1-1.9 Effects of Detached Iron Oxide Layer andSurface Contamination  The model compositionprofile of Figure A1-7 shows 3  of pure Fe 2O 3 over 22 of pure Cr 2O 3 on 316L stainless steel. This is amodel of a detached iron oxide layer. Figure A1-8 isthe theoretical depth profile of this model derivedassuming a depth of analysis of 5 lambda. Note that theinitial Cr value in the profile is higher than the Fe value,even though the surface is pure Fe 2O 3. This is aconsequence of the depth of analysis detecting the Crfrom levels beneath the surface. The Cr:Fe ratio forthis model has its maximum value at 3  below theinitial surface.

Figure A1-10 is the theoretical depthprofile of this model assuming a depth of analysis of5. In this case the O, Cr and Fe atomic concentrationvalues are reduced by the presence of the carbon untilthe depth profiling proceeds past the carbon, but theyhave the same relative values (ie: same Cr:Fe ratio)versus depth as derived in the uncontaminated model.The maximum of the Cr:Fe ratio is seen to be at theinitial surface. Although the actual oxide thickness isless in this model, the FWHM measure of the oxidethickness from the depth profile is the same due to thepresence of the carbon layer. Note that the Oxygenconcentration profile initially increases to a maximum,then decreases.

Suchtests may include performance demonstrations,demonstrations of reliability criteria, and achievementof purity standards. Such tests are the basis foracceptance or rejection by the purchaser against a pre-negotiated set of criteria for the performance of thesystem.5.4 Qualification Testing  Quali fication testing mayinclude tests for resistivity, temperature, pressure, TOC,dissolved oxygen, particle levels, bacteria, total silica,dissolved silica, non-volatile residue, ions, and metals.5.5 Monitoring  UPW systems a re monitored forcontinuing performance against desired and achievablelevels of quality. Action limits are generally set todetermine when system performance suggests thatcorrective action is required.5.6 UPW specifications  UPW s ystems are generallyguaranteed to deliver a certain quality of water on anongoing basis. The guaranteed performance isestablished in advance between the UPW equipmentmanufacturer and the system owner. Both qualificationtesting and monitoring testing use the guaranteedspecifications to determine the parameters and levels ofpurity to be tested.5.7 Recycle/Reclaim Opportunitie s There can beseveral opportunities for using water within a UPWsystem, and should be recognized during the designphase when possible. Examples are; use of 1 st passreject for cooling tower make-up water, returning UFreject to Primary or Feed water Tank, re-use of laststage rinse waters as UPW for lower grade use areas, i.e., CMP, isolation of CMP waste stream, for possiblereclaim/reuse. 6 Source Water6.1 Raw Water is the raw mate rial from whichUPW is made. Untreated raw water is natural waterthat is obtained from a surface source such as a lake orriver, or from a ground water source. The raw water toa UPW system is most frequently treated MunicipalDrinking Water.6.2 Municipal Drinking Water  Most natural rawwaters must be treated in order to produce drinkingwater that meets federal and state requirements. Thereare upper limits for inorganic contaminants (e.g.,asbestos, arsenic, copper, and lead), pesticides, volatileorganic chemicals (e.g., benzene, trichloroethylene,toluene, and xylene), turbidity, microbiologicalcontaminants, and radiological contaminants (e.g.,radon 226, radon 228, tritium, and strontium 90).Municipal Water Treatment may utilize onlychlorination, or filtration and chlorination for certainground water sources. For many surface water sources,coagulation (injection of aluminum or iron salts),flocculation (injection of a long-chain polymer),sedimentation, lime or lime/soda ash softening,filtration, chlorination or chloramination (chlorine plusammonia) and other steps may be required. 7 Major Treatment Processe s7.1 Pretreatment includes all of th e water treatmentsteps ahead of the Reverse Osmosis MembraneTreatment step. These steps are primarily required toprotect the membrane units from scaling with sparinglysoluble salts, fouling with living or non-livingsuspended particles, or chemical attack by pH,oxidizing agents or other dissolved contaminants.Pretreatment equipment may include media filtration,micro filtration, or ultrafiltration (bulk suspended solidsremoval), 15 micron cartridge filtration (polishing stepfor suspended solids removal), sodium-cycle cationexchange (softening, to remove scale-forming cations),acid injection (to minimize cellulose acetate membranedamage and/or to control carbonate scales), scaleinhibitor injection (to control scaling), activated carbonfiltration (to remove oxidizing agents and certainorganic molecules), and sulfite ion injection (to removeoxidizing agents).7.2 Reverse osmosis Membrane T reatment providesextremely high rejection of dissolved ions (chargedatoms and molecules), organic (carbon containing)compounds, silica (silicon containing) compounds, andvirtually complete rejection of suspended contaminants,but will not reject dissolved gases and volatile organiccompounds as well. Reverse osmosis (RO) units may"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 19 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F61-0301 \xa9 SEMI 2001 4 be configured in a double-pass arrangement consistingof two RO membrane units in series. Permeate(filtered water) from the first RO unit is sent to thesecond RO unit to be filtered again. It is notuncommon for the permeate from a double-pass ROunit to have a resistivity reading up to 0.54 Megohm-cm, with less than one milligram per liter of organicand silica contaminants. The more contaminantsremoved in the membrane treatment step, the lower theloading on the Polishing steps.7.3 Volatiles Removal  The removal of dissolvedoxygen, carbon dioxide, other gases, and volatileorganic compounds is a necessary treatment step. Theremoval of these volatile contaminants is accomplishedto acceptable levels in vacuum degasifiers and inmembrane degasification units. The removal ofvolatiles that can form ions and the removal of volatileorganic compounds reduce the loading on downstreamPolishing equipment.7.4 Polishing  The relatively low level ofcontaminants that were not removed in the MembraneTreatment and Volatiles Removal steps are polisheddown to acceptable levels in the Polishing steps. Ionic,organic, and silica contaminants are removed intypically two stages of Ion Exchange in series (primarybeds and polishing beds). Organic compounds,measured as TOC (Total Organic Carbon, or TotalOxidizable Carbon), that are found downstream of theRO membrane units may be subjected to TOCReduction ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (185 nanometerlow pressure units or medium pressure units) to convertmost of them into ionic compounds that can beeffectively removed by Primary Ion Exchange Units(usually consisting of Separate Beds, Mixed Beds orEDI/CDI/E-Cell). TOC compounds that exit theprimary ion exchange units are typically subjected toTOC reducing UV irradiation to break them intoionized compounds to be removed by the Polishing IonExchange Units. The vast majority of all livingsuspended particles (mainly bacteria) that enter any 254nm UV unit are inactivated. Downstream filters with apore size of less than or equal to 0.45 micron removethe inactivated bacterial bodies. The final filter prior toDistribution typically has a pore size of less than 0.2micron. 8 Distribution8.1 Distribution is frequently comp osed of one ormore Loops. Each loop consists of UPW thatcontinuously recirculates through appropriate pipingfrom the final filters, to the manufacturing areasrequiring UPW (end users), and back to a tank locatedwithin the Polishing section to be polished again. TheUPW to the end-user area is commonly called the Supply. The UPW that travels from the end-user areaback to the water treatment area is commonly called theReturn. Ozone may be injected into the Supply and/orReturn line to control microbiological contaminants andalso to enhance the action of TOC breakdown indownstream TOC reducing UV units. Sometimes ozoneis injected into the Supply line for similar reasons(requires de-ozonation at the end-use points).Sometimes the UPW in the distribution loop is heated(hot loop) for particular processes.8.2 Basic System Components8.3 General  Each UPW system contains certainbasic components and a variety of design options tomeet particular customer and facility needs.

However, it is up toeach individual owner of a UPW system to setspecifications for the purity of its water based on itsown needs and available resources.4.3 This guide is reflective of a pa rticular designapproach for a UPW system. The guidelines can beproduced from a properly maintained UPW system asdescribed and diagrammed in SEMI F61 and is typicaloutput from existing high-end semiconductormanufacturing plants with state-of-the-art watersystems. The purity of water generated in other types ofwater systems may differ greatly.4.4 The guidelines are targeted to UPW produced forsemiconductor manufacturing.
