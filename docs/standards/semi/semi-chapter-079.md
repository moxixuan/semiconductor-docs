SEMI F30-0298 © SEMI 19981 SEMI F30-0298START-UP AND VERIFICATION OF PURIFIER PERFORMANCETESTING FOR TRACE GAS IMPURITIES AND PARTICLES AT ANINSTALLATION SITE 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this procedure is to verify theperformance of purifiers by employing analyticalinstrumentation to measure gas impurities and particlesto customer specifications. If specific inlet challenge(s)and/or inlet measurements are required, it should bediscussed beforehand with the customer. Inletimpurities must be measured by part-per-million (PPM)or part-per-billion (PPB) analytical equipment. Thisprocedure applies only to large scale bulk purifiersrated at greater than 50 liters-per-minute (LPM)flowrate. 2 Scope2.1 Verify performance of large sc ale purifiers innitrogen, argon, helium, oxygen, and hydrogen service.Verification tests are done at PPB or sub-PPB levels ofgaseous impurities and sub-micron sizes of particlesmeasured downstream of any installed filter modules.Tests are done at maximum achievable flow of purifier,and/or customers specified percentages of maximumflow. 3 Limitations3.1 PPB and sub-PPB gaseous imp urity levels areachievable using atmospheric presssure ionization massspectrometry (APIMS), which is the preferred methodof choice, and the reduction gas detector (RGD)-gaschromatograph. APIMS is currently not available foroxygen service. A partial list of non-APIMS measuringequipment for use in oxygen service is in Appendix 1for commonly measured impurities. 4 Referenced Documents4.1 Approved procedures for oper ation of analyticalequipment.4.2 Approved gas sampling and pu rifier procedures. 5 TerminologyNone. 6 Summary of Method6.1 The purifier is started, and the operation ischecked. Each purifier bed is regenerated, andanalytical tests are done. The analytical results determine if the purified gas meets the customerspecifications. 7 Interferences7.1 The following sources might c ontribute tomisleading or high analytical results. Some identifiedsources are unpurged, dead-ended piping or isolationvalves, leaks in gas distribution system, insufficientpurge flow, and insufficient system clean-up time. 8 Apparatus8.1 Face seal fitting(s) with metal gaskets and stainlesssteel tubing for sampling.8.2 Dynamic dilution system for d iluting calibrationstandards to PPB and sub-PPB levels for calibration ofanalytical equipment.8.3 APIMS  The sample gas, nit rogen, is introducedinto an APIMS where a small amount of it is ionized.By collision with ionized nitrogen, impurity moleculesare ionized with high efficiency. The mass analyzer,which can be a quadrupole, time-of-flight (TOF), oreven a magnetic sector, separates and focusses the ionsby their mass-to-charge ratio. An electron multiplierdetects and counts each ion fragment and amount.8.4 Reduction Gas Detector-Gas C hromatograph(RGD-GC)  The reduction gas detector is a heatedmercuric oxide bed that reacts with reducing gases,such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The mercuryevolved is detected and displayed as a peak. The GCemploys a heated molecular sieve column to separatethe H 2 and CO.8.5 Ultratrace Analytical Instrume ntation Requiredother than APIMS  Ultratrace instrumentation isdefined as having sufficient sensitivity to measure allimpurities of interest at the specified level of thecustomer at the PPB or sub-PPB.8.6 Particle counter.8.7 Data collection and reduction system. 9 Reagents and Materials9.1 Certified calibration standards .

Purge system prior tosampling.12.2 Dynamic Dilution System  U se certifiedstandards and dilute using equation (1) to calculate finalconcentration (CF). For moisture, certified moisturepermeation devices can be used.(1) Cc  D.F. = C FC c = PPM - or PPB - certified cylinder standard concentration.C F = final concentration.D.F. = dilution factor which is calculated by taking theflow (in liters) of the certified standard and dividingby total flow (in liters). Dilution factors can bemultiplied in series, if diluting more than once.Example 1: What is the final concentration fordynamically diluting 10 ml of a 100 PPB impurity into1 liter?100 PPB  \[0.010 liter/1.010 liter\] = 0.99 PPB12.2.1 Calibration should be done in the regionspecified by the purifier manufacturer. For example, ifthe purifier has an outlet impurity guarantee of 1 PPBof each impurity, then the test equipment should becalibrated with levels at approximately 1 PPB, not at 30PPB and extrapolated down. Also, multipointcalibration data is preferred.12.3 APIMS, RGD-GC, ultratrace a nalyticalinstrumentation. Particle counter.12.3.1 Start-up and purge the instrum entation. Performcalibration.

SEMI F31-0698 © SEMI 1998 4 7.2 Source  The source of all flu ids for incomingBulk Chemical Distribution Systems is a containersuitable for holding reactive chemicals in a size 55gallons or greater, which may include drums, totes,vessels, or ISO containers.7.3 Fluid Transfer  Fluids in the Bulk ChemicalDistribution Systems are transported through pipesusing either a pumping system, a pressure differentialsystem, or some combination of the two types of basicsystems. All fluids are transported in secondarycontainment piping systems for safety reasons.7.4 Distribution  The transfer is made from thesource by means of certain types of mechanisms,usually through one or more valve manifold boxes, thatdirect the fluid to a point of use, to subordinate levels ofdistribution, and/or to a day tank.7.5 Control Systems  Manual an d/or automatedmechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, optical, andelectronic systems control the movement of the liquids.This includes the volume, flow rate, pressure, start-up,and shut-off. 8 Optional Design Features8.1 Polishing  BCD Systems ma y be designed withthe possibility of chemical recirculation (1) from theincoming source and back, to polish the incomingchemical; (2) from the day tank and back for furtherpolishing or timed recirculation if activity is limited;and (3) fabwide in continuous recirculation.8.2 Filtration  Chemicals in the system may berecirculated through filters placed on-line in the system.The relevant design issues include types of filters,efficiency, useful lifetime, qualification, filter bleed,removal, and replacement.8.3 Day Tank  The vessel that g enerally stores alimited amount of chemical volume generallyequivalent to that used in about one day of operation.This holding vessel usually stores prefiltered chemicalbefore it is transferred to the manufacturing process.8.4 Blending  Certain chemicals in distribution areblended together for use in the semiconductormanufacturing process. For example, Buffered OxideEtchant is a blend of Hydrofluoric Acid andAmmonium Fluoride and may be sourced as twoseparate chemicals and blended together in the correctconcentrations within the BCD Systems.8.5 Dilution  Certain chemicals used in thesemiconductor manufacturing process require variousconcentrations, depending on the process used at aparticular point in the system. For example, 49%Hydrofluoric Acid is brought in as the source chemical and then mixed with DIW in a blend unit to achievevarious concentrations of 10:1, 100:1, etc., dependingon the requirements of the manufacturing process.8.6 Automated Control Systems  Electronic systemsmay be programmed to control system parameters suchas volume, pressure, fill rate, flow, drain times,maintenance diagnostics, purge cycles, recirculation,and bypass.8.7 Sampling Ports  Sampling p orts may beincorporated into the system to facilitate chemicalsampling for qualification and monitoring programs.8.8 On-Site Chemical Generation  Liquidchemicals, such as Ammonium Hydroxide, may begenerated on-site at the required concentration from aclean Ammonia gas source and DIW to the requiredconcentration. Generally, this activity is done in alocation apart from the dispense room. The resultingchemical is used as a source for the distribution system.8.9 Reprocessing  Integrated wi th the generalchemical distribution system may be a chemicalreprocessing unit which purifies or recycles a chemicalsuch as sulfuric acid, isopropanol, or hydrofluoric acid.Such a system enables the chemical to reenter thesystem as a clean source of material for manufacturingprocessing.8.10 Stabilized Filtration  Some systems include adesign feature that provides for the continuous flow ofchemical over filters to minimize shocking andpulsating of the filters.8.11 Surge Suppression  Some sy stems include adevice or in-line chamber that minimizes hydraulicforces caused by a pump. This option may also bereferred to as pulsation dampener. 9 Monitoring and Maintenan ce of Systems9.1 General Considerations  Bu lk ChemicalDistribution Systems may require a significant level ofmaintenance and monitoring to determine thatspecifications and performance are initially andcontinually met.9.2 Functional Management Syste m  The entiredispense system can be monitored by means ofPC/PLC/ or any hybrid system, recording events as theyoccur and alerting operators as necessary to takecorrective action. Monitoring systems may include avariety of operational parameters:9.2.1 on-line real-time monitoring o f all chemicaldispense units9.2.2 status of components and subs ystems9.2.3 events logging

They should be calibrated to maintain theminimum accuracy necessary for the governing flowequations.8.1.3 Throttle Valve(s)  A throttle valve shall bepositioned downstream. There is no valve stylerestriction, however they should be sized sufficientlyfor the required flowrate.8.1.4 Flow Measurement  Depend ing upon the testmedia, several types of flow measurement devices maybe used. These devices may include: turbine meter,orifice plate, bell prover, mass flow meter, and timedvolumetric capture. Flow measurement devices shouldbe calibrated to maintain the minimum accuracynecessary for the governing flow equations. All flowmeasurements should be normalized to standardconditions per ANSI 2530.

See the referenced section fordetails.8.3 Compressible Fluid8.3.1 Procedure8.3.1.1 The test procedure is specified in ANSI/ISA-S75.02, paragraph 7.1.8.3.2 Test Limitations 8.3.2.1 If possible, at least 3 data poin ts should betaken at flowrates where the fluid approachesincompressible behavior. To attain these conditions, thepressure drop ratio, x, should be less than or equal to0.02. Additional data points should be taken atincreasing flowrates up to the maximum possible forthe system. 9 Coefficients Calculation9.1 Flow Coefficient, Cv9.1.1 The flow coefficient, Cv, can b e calculated usingboth incompressible and compressible fluids. Forincompressible fluids, ISA provides a relatively simplemethod for determining Cv. For compressible fluids, theISA test method for calculating Cv requires thedetermination of the choked flow pressure drop ratio,x T,, and ultimately the expansion factor, Y, whichcharacterizes the valve geometry and fluid properties atsonic velocities in the vena contracta. It has beendetermined through considerable testing that theexpansion factor is critical in calculating actual pressuredrops across a valve when flow rates cause the fluiddensity to change due to pressure and velocity changes.9.2 Pressure Drop Ratio Factor, xT9.2.1 The ISA test method requires t he experimentaldetermination of the flow coefficient Cv and a secondcoefficient x T, the pressure drop ratio factor.9.2.2 x T is equal to the critical pressu re ratio of the ISAflow equation, and is close but not necessarily identicalto the experimentally observed pressure ratio at chokedflow. x T is chosen to correlate the experimentallyobserved choked flow. The ISA equation will thenpredict choking at a pressure drop ratio close to, but notidentical with, the experimentally observed value.9.2.3 There are two methods to dete rmine the pressuredrop ratio factor. The procedure of ANSI/ISA-S75.02,Section 7.2 requires that C v be determined at values of xless than 0.02, and that choking actually be achieved todetermine x T. The alternate procedure of paragraph 7.3does not actually require choked flow and uses all thedata points to determine Cv, not just a few points at asmall value of x.9.2.4 In practice, valves used in the semiconductormanufacturing facility, when connected as describedabove, may not be able to achieve choked flow acrossthe pressure taps provided by this procedure. This willhappen when choked flow occurs first in some otherpart of the test setup or connections. However, thealternative test procedure of ANSI/ISA-S75.02, Section7.3 will give the correct values of Cv and x T in this case.9.2.5 The ISA alternative method de termines thepressure drop ratio factor by measuring flowrate vs.

This method hasbeen found, through exhaustive testing, to be a veryaccurate and reliable method to determine theexpansion factor, without having to achieve chokedflow in the test valve itself. 10 Pressure Drop Calculation10.1 The determination of both flow coefficient andexpansion factor are critical in calculating the pressuredrop across a valve flowing compressible fluid. Use ofthe flow coefficient Cv only, will yield a pressure dropwhich is lower than the actual value.10.1.1 Incompressible Flow10.1.1.1 To calculate pressure drop across a valveflowing an incompressible media, only the Cvcoefficient must be provided by the valve manufacturer.The following equation has been derived fromANSI/ISA-S75.01, Section 4.1, and should be used forpressure drop computations: PkPa = 0.0865\*Qm3hrCv    2 S f Ppsid = QgpmCv  2 S f    Equation 2Pressure Drop for Incompressible Flow 10.1.2 Compressible Flow10.1.2.1 To calculate pressure drop across a valveflowing a compressible media, both Cv and x Tcoefficients may be used to determine more accuratelythe pressure drop. Contact the valve manufacturer forvalues of C V and x T coefficients.

SEMI F33-0998 © SEMI 19981 SEMI F33-0998METHOD FOR CALIBRATION OF ATMOSPHERIC PRESSUREIONIZATION MASS SPECTROMETER (APIMS) 1 Purpose1.1 This test method may provide guidelines for thecalibration of the APIMS for measurement ofimpurities in nitrogen, argon, helium and hydrogen.APIMS is currently the technique of choice formeasurements of low level impurities in gasdistribution systems and components because it isessentially the only commercially available methodcapable of ppt impurity analysis and it has a superiorresponse time. This method may provide guidelines forapplication of other techniques with similar detectionlimits and response time to APIMS which are notcommercially available at this time. 2 Scope2.1 This method applies to the ana lyte calibration ofthe APIMS for a target impurity range of 100 ppt to ashigh as 100 ppb impurity range. The actual calibrationrange should bracket the impurity measurement rangeof interest, dependent upon the measurement to beconducted. Anything else is outside the range of thecalibration. 3 Limitations3.1 The actual range of calibration will depend uponthe type of APIMS used. Counting detection electronicswill saturate in the 200,000 CPS to 1,000,000 CPSrange, depending upon the make and model. Countingdetection will have to use different ions in differentconcentration regions, depending upon the impurity.The actual calibration procedure will be different forAPIMS using analog detection versus countingdetection. Interference between impurities can causelimitation in measurements in the presence of multipleimpurity species. 4 Referenced Documents4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI C9.1  Guide for Analysis of Uncertainties inGravimetrically Prepared Gas MixturesSEMI C15  Test Method for ppm and ppb HumidityStandards 5 Terminology5.1 Acronyms5.1.1 APIMS  Atmospheric Pressu re IonizationMass Spectrometer 5.1.2 CPS  Counts per second5.1.3 m/z  m in atomic mass units and z inelementary charge units5.1.4 NIST  National Institute of S tandards andTechnology5.1.5 ppb  Molar parts per billion (nmole/mole).The same as ppbv.5.1.6 ppm  Molar parts per million (mole/mole).The same as ppmv.5.1.7 ppt  Molar parts per trillion (pimole/mole).The same as pptv.5.1.8 R2  The statistic described b y the ratio of thesum of squares of the regression divided by the totalsum of the squares.5.2 Definitions5.2.1 zero gas  Nitrogen, argon, h elium or hydrogenwith an estimated level an order of magnitude, or more,lower than the lowest calibration point for eachimpurity of interest. 6 Summary of Method6.1 The calibration of the APIMS is conducted byadding known concentrations of impurities to a zero gasand measuring the corresponding ion intensities. Acalibration response factor can be determined byregression analysis. 7 Interferences7.1 It is essential to confirm that th e mass chosen isindeed representative of the species of interest and thatother commonly present impurities do not contribute atthe same mass. For example: the intensity of the peak atm/z = 29 correlates with the concentration of H2 in N 2,because of the N2H + formation. However, spurioussignal at this peak can arise in two different ways:(i) Contributions of other ions of the same mass, suchas N 14N 15+ or C2H 5+.(ii) Contributions of the same ion from different parentspecies, i.e., N2H + due to recombination of matrixgas nitrogen with fragments of H2O, CH 4, etc.Before using m/z = 29 as a measure of H 2 in N 2,interference such as these must be understood. Thisalso may apply to other ions.

SEMI F33-0998 © SEMI 1998 2 7.2 High impurity levels can cause clustering with, orquenching of, the other impurity ions and affect thesensitivity of the APIMS for those impurities. This isespecially true for impurity levels of 10 ppb and above. 8 Apparatus8.1 APIMS  The APIMS used fo r impurity detectioncan be of any type.8.2 Impurity Standard  Any dev ice (either standardcylinder or permeation tube based or of any other type)that can reliably deliver impurity concentrations usuallyin the range of 100 ppb to 10 ppm with an accuracy of± 5%. The standards should be traceable to anapplicable national standard, such as NIST.8.3 Dynamic Dilution System  A dilution systemthat can dilute the output gas of the impurity standardwith a zero gas to produce a gas with impurityconcentrations in the range of interest. 9 Reagents and Materials9.1 Zero gas9.2 Impurity standard 10 Safety Precautions10.1 This method applies to calibra tion andmeasurement of impurities in nitrogen, argon, heliumand hydrogen. This method does not address theadditional safety precautions for APIMS calibration andimpurity measurement in hydrogen gas. 11 Test Specimen11.1 Not applicable. 12 Preparation of Apparatus12.1 The impurity standard and zer o gas should beconnected to the dynamic dilution system, which is inturn connected to the inlet of the APIMS. The entiredilution system should be purged until all impuritieshave stabilized at a constant dilution system flow, forall components in the dilution system. The relativestandard deviation for each analyte should be less than10% for the past 12 hours before the calibration.Constant pressure and flow should be maintained to theAPIMS ionization region at all time. 13 Calibration and Standardi zation13.1 Definition of an Impurity Stan dard  Animpurity standard is defined to be any device capableof delivering a flow of known impurity level gas at acontrolled pressure. (See Section 8.2.) 13.2 Examples of Standards  Some examples ofimpurity standards and the principles upon which theyare based are as follows:13.2.1 Cylinder Standards  The st andard willinclude a regulator specified for use with the cylinder.The impurity concentration can be calculated based onthat added to the cylinder in preparation. A minimumuse pressure must be specified.13.2.2 Permeation and effusion tube s tandards. Thesemust include purification means and some means ofregulating the outlet pressure. The impurity deliveryrate can be calculated based on the weight loss of thetube as a function of time.13.2.3 Moisture standard methods ba sed on saturationof gas with water vapor at a fixed temperature andpressure. The moisture concentration in the gas maythen be calculated from a knowledge of the saturationvapor pressure of water over a plane of the pure phaseof ice at the saturation temperature and of theinteraction virial coefficients of the gas-vapor mixture.The two-pressure and two temperature methods arerefinements of this approach requiring additionalchambers whose temperature and pressure must beknown.13.3 Dilution of Standards  For a ll impuritygeneration methods, lower concentrations can begenerated by dynamic dilution, i.e., by combining aknown flow of the standard gas with a known flow ofzero gas. A diluted standard is acceptable provided:13.3.1 The zero gas should have an im purity level atleast an order of magnitude below the stated level of theanalysis (to be verified using the same flow path asduring the subsequent analysis, and at the lowest flowrate actually used in the calibration).13.3.2 The absolute accuracy of the d ilution systemcomponents are verified by comparison with a reliableflow standard. The frequency of verification must takeinto account the transport of the instrument and otherchanges that will affect the dilution system.13.3.3 The linearity of the dilution sy stem can bedemonstrated over the entire range of operation. Thislast criterion is particularly important whenever someportion of the combined flow is discarded, as mixingproblems can easily arise at large dilution factors.13.4 Mass Calibration  The mass scale of the massspectrometer should be calibrated according to themanufacturers instructions over the mass range ofinterest.

SEMI F33-0998 © SEMI 19983 13.4.1 The validity of the mass select ed for eachimpurity must be confirmed (i) by demonstrating thatthe intensity at the mass increases monotomically withadded concentration of the impurity species of interestand (ii) that other usually present impurity species donot make significant contributions to the intensity atthat mass.

Based on prior calibrations, thesystem should be below 100 ppt, or at least an order ofmagnitude lower than the lowest calibration point, forthe impurities to be calibrated.14.2 Prior to beginning the calibrati on, record allrelevant parameters, such as discharge voltage, lensvoltages, ionization chamber pressure and/or flow, gastype, etc.14.3 The user should use the zero g as only, plus aminimum of 5 challenge concentrations, with aminimum of 5 data points, with the blended data pointsspanning the range of interest of impurity measurement,excluding the zero point, while maintaining constantflow to the APIMS. Allow each challenge concentrationto stabilize for at least 15 minutes, and the signalvariation should be less than 3% before taking datapoints at that concentration. Record the relevant ionintensities as a function of time, for each stabilizedconcentration. 14.4 Once the linearity of the calibr ation has beenestablished, a single point calibration check ispermitted, as long as the accuracy of the dilution systemis confirmed. 15 Calculations or Interpreta tion of Results15.1 Perform a regression analysis for the individualion intensities against the impurity concentration. Besure to use only ion intensities below the saturationregion of your APIMS ion counting electronics, if usingcounting detection. (Ask the manufacturer for thesaturation region of the units counting electronics.) TheR2 from the fit of all the regression coefficients shouldbe 0.98 or above. If this is not the case, the calibrationwill have to be repeated as described in the previoussection. 16 Reporting Results16.1 As a minimum, the calibration will include thefollowing information for each impurity: y = c0 + c1 \* x (1)where,y is the ion intensity, c0 is ion intensitybackground, c1 is the linear response factor,and x is the impurity level. 16.2 As an option, a quadratic regre ssion may bereported for the calibration, and will include thefollowing information for each impurity: y = c0 + c1 \* x + c2 \* x2 (2)where,y is the ion intensity, c0 is ion intensitybackground, c1 is the first order responsefactor, c2 is the second order response factorand x is the impurity level. The c0 /c1 ratio or negative x - intercept isuseful to define the background concentrationof each particular ion. All regression coefficientsshould be reported. 17 Precision and Accuracy17.1 This method does not explicitl y consider theestimation of the accuracy of the impurity standard indetail, because such a calculation can be made byapplying procedures described elsewhere.

A separate labelmay be used for the additional information.6.6 The color field label length an d lettering sizes shown in Table 2 should be used for all diameters of pipe andtubing. For pipe diameters smaller than 12.7 mm (0.5 inch), the label should be large enough to wrap at least halfway around the pipe, and not obstruct the text. If labeling inside equipment, the size of the labels may be adjusted,provided they remain easily seen and readable. Consideration should be given to using tags instead of labels.NOTE: Labeling sizes for piping 19 mm (0.75 inch) or larger in outside diameter were taken directly from ANSI A13.1. Smallersizes were developed for this guide.6.7 The height of the label should be at least two times (2) the height of the text, with the text centered in thelabel. The label should allow a length of background color on each end of the text at least one half pipe diameter inlength but not less than 12.7 mm (0.5 inch).6.8 The orientation of text on the l abel should conform to local customs, conventions, or practices.6.9 Directional flow arrows should be applied to all piping systems indicating the direction of material flow withinthe system. The arrow(s) should be included as part of the primary label but may be applied separately within closeproximity to the primary label (e.g., less than 5 cm (2 inches) for pipe diameters up to 5 cm (2 inches); less than 15cm for larger pipe diameters).6.10 Labels should be applied to the piping system at the following minimum locations: On both sides of a barrier penetration (i.e., walls, floors, ceilings, equipment enclosures, etc.). The labels shouldbe applied within 1 meter (3.3 feet) or as close as practical to the barrier. As close as practical to all changes in direction where the length of run in the new direction is 1 meter (3.3 feet)or greater. Where several directional changes are made within a short length of run, labels need not be appliedat every change in direction, but should be applied at sufficient intervals to readily identify the piping. On long runs, the labels should be applied at intervals not exceeding 6 meters (20 feet). Shorter intervals shouldbe used for small diameter pipe and where several pipes are run in close proximity. Where several pipes are run parallel to each other, the labeling for all pipes should be in line with each other(i.e., should not be staggered). A sufficient number of labels should be applied at each location to ensure that they can be readily seen and readfrom all viewing or approach direction(s). Each side of a T connection should be labeled within 1 meter (3.3 feet) of the T.

SEMI F35-0304 © SEMI 1998, 20041 SEMI F35-0304TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTIONSYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVEOXYGEN MEASUREMENT This test method was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility ofthe North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on December 4, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org February 2004; to be published March2004. Originally published September 1998. 1 Purpose1.1 This test method defines a procedure to monitor theintegrity of ultra-high purity (UHP) gas distributionsystems by detecting the ingress of atmosphericoxygen. This test method would be used to evaluate anactive UHP gas distribution system on a continuousbasis by using non-invasive O 2 measurement, withoutrequiring an interruption of the process tools using theUHP gases of interest.1.2 This test method should be used to protectsemiconductor fabrication processes using the UHPgases, which may be sensitive to contamination by anyof the common atmospheric impurities, such as N 2, O 2,H 2O, CO 2 , before product yield problems develop.1.3 This is the first such test method that describes anoninvasive leak detection and locating procedure. Itdiffers from SEMI F1, which is an invasive techniquefor identifying leak sources using a mass spectrometerand a helium tracer gas. 2 Scope2.1 This test method applies to UHP gas distributionsystems used in semiconductor manufacturing facilitiesand comparable research and development areas.2.2 This test method applies to bulk gas distributionsystems carrying UHP gases such as N2, Ar, He, H 2,N 2O, SF 6, and many halocarbons. In most cases, O2 ispresent only in ultra-low trace levels (typically less than1.0 ppb).2.3 This test method will provide real-time monitoringof UHP gas distribution systems, resulting inmeaningful system integrity verification, atmosphericcontaminant trending analysis, and leak locating.2.4 This test method will provide the user withsufficient information to identify and troubleshootsources of atmospheric leakage into the UHP gasdistribution system.2.5 This test method includes the specification of therequired O 2 analytical equipment, standard methods forproper use of the O 2 analytical equipment, and manipulation of the O2 data in identifying atmosphericleak sources.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This test method will only be successful inidentifying the presence and location of leaks fromatmospheric air using O 2 as the tracer gas representativeof all atmospheric air contaminants (i.e., N2 , O 2, H 2O,CO 2). There is no capability to identify cross-contaminant species between different UHP gaseswhich only contain ultra-low trace levels of O2 oroutward leaks to atmosphere.3.2 This test method will not focus specifically on theprocess of detecting the exact location of every possibleatmospheric air leakage source. Rather, it will describetechniques and examples demonstrating howatmospheric air leaks can be reliably identified andlocated, in general.3.3 Results from this test method may not ensure thatother common atmospheric impurities (e.g., H 2O) arebelow their required specification limits after a leak hasbeen identified, corrected, and O2 levels have returnedto normal. For example, since O2 diffuses more quicklyand has a weaker surface adsorption than H2O, O 2 willbe the first atmospheric impurity detected. However,H 2O will likely be the last atmospheric impurity to bepurged out once a leak has been identified and repaired.3.4 This test method is not a direct substitution forSEMI F1. 4 Referenced Standard4.1 SEMI StandardSEMI F1  Specification for Leak Integrity of HighPurity Gas Piping Systems and Components

This is considered to be a normal andacceptable impurity level.5.2.3 critical sample point  gas sample point whichis monitored continuously because it is deemed in acritical location in the distribution system, or that whichis most sensitive to causing product/process qualityproblems from the ingress of atmospheric airimpurities.5.2.4 investigative sample point  gas sample pointwhich is selected for spot checking analysis as part ofan investigation to locate an atmospheric air leaksource.5.2.5 low detectable limit  defined as the smallestlevel of O 2 measurement which can be quantified afterperforming a blank test on zero gas. For our purposes,this is determined to be 2 times the total peak-to-peaknoise over 8 hours while the O 2 analyzer is sampling onzero gas.5.2.6 point of use  the connection point where thegas distribution system connects to the process toolwhich uses the UHP gas.5.2.7 sensitivity  Defined as the smallest detectablestep change in O 2 that the analyzer is capable ofsensing.5.2.8 ultra-high purity (UHP) gas distribution system semiconductor fab gas delivery system whichtypically contains impurities from atmospheric air of &lt;0.2 ppb at the input source, and atmospheric impuritiesat the point-of-use of typically &lt; 1 ppb.5.2.9 weekly zero drift  total analyzer drift whilemeasuring zero gas over a 1-week time period. Includesall components of analyzer drift.5.2.10 zero gas  test gas which is known to containless than 0.1 ppb of O 2 as an impurity. 6 Summary of Method6.1 The user must identify critical sampling locationsin the UHP gas distribution system. These points areeither specific process tool points-of-use or key lateralbranch lines, which must avoid atmosphericcontamination, or representative of a critical purity zonecontaining process tools that are particularly sensitiveto atmospheric contaminants.6.2 Connect O 2 analysis equipment to these criticalsample points for continuous monitoring.6.3 Qualify the performance of the O 2 analysisequipment before collecting data.6.4 Begin continuous monitoring of critical samplepoints. Identify typical or baseline contaminantsignature performance of the UHP gas distributionsystem.6.5 Use continuous trend data to identify problematicevents (contaminant spikes) and/or significant changesfrom the contaminant signature performance level.6.6 Use additional investigative sample pointmeasurements (spot checks) along with observablecorrelations to gas distribution system usage to locateand correct atmospheric leak sources. 7 Interferences7.1 While sampling from any point in the gasdistribution system, it is critical that the sample bedelivered to the O 2 analytical equipment withoutintroducing additional atmospheric O 2. This couldcreate significant errors in the analysis. Observing ahigher O 2 reading after reducing the sample flow to theanalyzer may be an indication that there is a leakbetween the sample point and the O 2 analysisequipment.7.2 An O 2 analyzer may become inaccurate due toimproper calibration or simply due to long-termanalyzer drift. This will cause inaccurate O 2 readingswhich do not represent the true performance of theUHP gas distribution system. The O 2 analyzer must beoperated per the manufacturers recommendation forcalibration technique, calibration frequency, and otherroutine maintenance.7.3 Some O 2 analytical methods have cross-sensitivityto other gaseous components which may be found inUHP gases (i.e., H 2, CO, CH 4, and other hydrocarbons). 8 Requirements8.1 Personnel Qualification  Personnel performingthese tests in accordance with this test method shallhave suitable training and experience. Such personnelshall, as a minimum, be knowledgeable of:

&lt;!-- Page 29 --&gt;

SEMI F35-0304 © SEMI 1998, 20043 8.1.1 The operation and calibration of the specificequipment used in performing this test.8.1.2 The proper procedures in handling UHP gases asagreed upon by supplier and user.8.1.3 The proper safety procedure in handlingcombustible or toxic gases as agreed upon by supplierand user.8.1.4 The behavior of atmospheric leak sources relativeto position, pressure/flow, and gas usage. 9 Apparatus9.1 An analyzer must be selected which is capable ofcontinuous ultra-low trace O2 measurements, with theability to report measurements with at least once perminute frequency.9.2 The ultra-low trace O2 analyzer shall meet orexceed the following specifications. Thesespecifications are appropriately defined in Section 5:Sensitivity &lt; 0.1 ppbLow Detectable Limit &lt; 0.3 ppbWeekly Zero Drift &lt; 0.5 ppbResponse Time &lt; 10 minutes for 90% of a01 ppb O 2 step changeNOTE 2: The O2 analysis must be conducted using ananalytical method which meets or exceeds the specificationsrequired by this test method. If not, the user will not be able toconfidently distinguish true gas distribution system impuritytrends from false analyzer trends. 10 Safety Precautions10.1 This test method is not a replacement for safetyregulations. It is the responsibility of the user to ensurethat the UHP gas distribution systems under analysiscomply with applicable safety regulations, as agreed tobetween gas supplier and user.10.2 It is also the responsibility of the user to complywith applicable safety regulations governing theoperation of the required O2 analytical equipment, asspecified by the analyzer manufacturer. 11 Identify Sample Point Locations11.1 Identify the critical sample point locations in theUHP gas distribution system which allow for acontinuous gauging of overall system integrity. Theseshall include, at a minimum:11.1.1 An exit purity O 2 measurement of the UHP gasat the furthest point of the gas distribution systemwithin the fab. 11.1.2 Sample point locations representing sub-sections of the UHP gas distribution system, which aredeemed critical for the avoidance of atmosphericimpurities.11.1.3 Point-of-use process tool locations which aredeemed critical for the avoidance of atmosphericimpurities.11.2 A source purity O 2 measurement of the UHP gasentering the gas distribution system is suggested to beused as a reference comparison against other pointswithin the fab.11.3 Additional investigative (spot check) O 2measurements may be required at sample pointlocations which aid in deducing the location ofsuspected atmospheric leak sources. This will vary fromsituation to situation. (See Section 16.)11.4 The exact sample tap location must berepresentative of the measurement point of interest.Avoid measurement of dead-leg locations. 12 Preparation of Sample Point Locations12.1 Thoroughly pre-purge the sample point prior toconnecting the O2 analyzer.12.2 Thoroughly cycle-purge any regulators or othercomponents in the sample system. Cycle the pressure atleast 20 times with a high/low pressure ratio of at least5 times.12.3 Connect the O2 analyzer to the sample point usingappropriate UHP gas lines and fittings. Avoid usinglong lengths of bellows-type tubing because of longpurge-down requirements. Avoid using Teflon orplastic tubing of any kind. Teflon and most otherplastics are extremely permeable to O2 and will causeatmospheric O 2 leakage. Only a few feet of plastictubing can introduce ppm levels of O 2.12.4 Establish flow from the sample point to the O2analyzer per the manufacturers recommendations. 13 Calibration and Qualification13.1 Follow the manufacturers recommendations forinitial start-up and calibration of the O 2 analyzer.13.2 After initial start-up and calibration, adhere to themanufacturers recommendations for routine calibrationand maintenance needed to achieve the requiredperformance specification as described in Section 9.2.

SEMI F35-0304 © SEMI 1998, 2004 4 13.3 There will be two modes of O2 measurement:13.3.1 Critical Sample Point O 2 Measurement13.3.1.1 Applicable to O 2 measurements performedcontinuously on the critical sample point locationsidentified earlier.13.3.1.2 Prior to continuous data collection use of theanalyzer, validate it by demonstrating the capabilityrequired in the specification for Weekly Zero Drift.Chart the zero baseline drift and peak-to-peak noisewhile on zero gas for 1 week.13.3.1.3 Re-validate the O 2 analyzer performance byrunning a 24-hour blank test on zero gas monthly.13.3.2 Investigative Sample Point O2 Measurement13.3.2.1 Applicable to spot check O 2 measurementsperformed in the investigation of locating atmosphericleak sources.13.3.2.2 The O 2 analyzer must be operated for a timeperiod sufficient to establish the contaminantsignature at the point of interest.13.3.2.3 Validate the O2 analyzer with a blank testprior to each use. Chart zero baseline drift over a periodof time which is twice as long as the expected timerequired to make the O 2 measurement. If ameasurement can typically be made successfully in lessthan one hour, then verify the zero drift and peak-topeak noise with a two-hour blank test. 14 Data Collection Procedure14.1 Collect all O 2 measurement data at a minimum of1 point/minute using a chart recorder or data acquisitiondevice.14.2 Graph data points with sufficient resolution toobserve trends over a one-week period. The graph mustalso be able to resolve O 2 spikes which may last only1015 minutes. 15 Interpretation of Results15.1 Generate graphs of the baseline contaminantsignature for each critical sample point location.Compare the baseline contaminant signature with theO 2 analyzers blank run on zero gas to validate that theanalyzer is producing useful data. The base-linecontaminant signature should exhibit equal or greaterO 2 variation than the blank run on zero gas.15.2 Problem Identification15.2.1 Observe data from critical sample pointlocations and look for deviations (abnormal trends orevents) from the baseline contaminant signature.15.2.2 Determine if deviations (observed trends orevents) are sufficient to impede mandatory atmosphericimpurity specifications or influence criticalproduct/process quality.15.2.2.1 If yes, proceed into Section 16.15.2.2.2 If no, continue observing O 2 data from criticalsample point locations.

SEMI F35-0304 © SEMI 1998, 20045 16 Atmospheric Leak Locating Procedure16.1 Familiarize yourself with Figure 1 before proceeding with the remainder of Section 16. Figure 1Typical Fab UHP Gas Distribution System16.2 Isolate a zone where the contamination is likely to originate from by comparing the O2 levels at the criticalcontinuous monitoring sample point locations. Assume the leak source is somewhere between the lastuncontaminated sample point and the first contaminated sample point going downstream. Some knowledge of thegas distribution flow path will be required here.16.3 Compare the data from the O 2 analyzer detecting the contamination with pressure and flow data, or gas usagedemand over time in the specific lateral of the gas distribution system where the O2 analysis is being made.16.4 Correlate the changes in O 2 readings which show abnormally high O2 levels with specific tool cycles thatcause the UHP gas pressure and flow in the lateral line to change. The timing of the analyzers response to theseusage demands will give some clues as to the approximate position of the atmospheric leak source.NOTE 3: Back-contamination is likely originating in a leg which is dead at the time the O2 analyzer responds. Actual responsetime will depend on the time needed for the contaminant to travel to the O2 analyzer plus the response time of the O2 analyzer.16.5 If no demand cycles in the lateral cause O2 readings to change, then the source of contamination is likely tooccur further upstream in the distribution system, prior to the intersection of the lateral in question. This assumesthat there is always a net flow of gas in the line leading to the intersection of the lateral being checked.

&lt;!-- Page 32 --&gt;

SEMI F35-0304 © SEMI 1998, 2004 6 16.6 Perform an investigative O 2 measurement (spotcheck) with a portable O2 analyzer at each laterallocation that is suspected in causing contamination inthe main or sub-main line which supplies the lateralwhere the contamination was originally detected. Workupstream away from the lateral which showed a sign ofcontamination.16.7 Once the lateral with the contamination source hasbeen identified, use the steps outlined in Sections 16.3and 16.4 to locate the exact point of the atmosphericleak source.16.8 Refine the selection of investigative sample pointlocations along with a careful study of system flowdynamics until the leak is pinpointed and repaired.16.9 Confirm that the leak source has been correctedby providing an investigative O2 measurementdownstream of the leak source. 17 Example in Locating Leak Source17.1 See Figure 1 which is a schematic representationof a typical fab branching type gas distribution system.Since a loop type gas distribution system has one lesspiping level between the main line and the tools, it ismore straightforward to monitor and diagnose. Thisexample, although more complex, has beendemonstrated in practice. It shows how an atmosphericleak originating at a single tool location can back-contaminate a sub-main distribution line, yet notcontaminate all the way back to the main line. In thisexample, the contamination would not be detected bythe UHP analysis instrumentation typically installed onthe main line.17.2 The contaminant signature oxygen analyzers areinstalled at critical purity locations, shown in Figure 1as A 1 , A 2, and A 3. These analyzers show baselinecontaminant signature O levels of 0.20.5 ppb. Bydefinition, as established by the user for each criticalpurity location, these are normal contaminant levels atthese locations. 17.2.1 A 2 and A3 begin showing excursions up to 12ppb that last for several minutes, then settle back intothe normal 0.20.5 ppb range. The excursions takeplace infrequently at first, but then develop someregularity. Although the absolute O 2 level detected doesnot yet indicate that the potential atmospheric leak(H 2O and N 2 included) would pose a direct risk to thecritical purity of process tools located nearby, it doesdiffer significantly from the baseline contaminantsignature. This prompts an investigation before a full-scale process production problem results.17.2.2 Each of the lateral lines being monitored by A 2and A 3 shows the same level of O2 contamination, so itis deduced that the contamination is coming from thesub-main line which feeds both laterals. Since analyzerA 1 does not show the contamination, it is furtherdeduced that the leak source is located between A1 andA 2.17.3 Working back upstream along the sub-main,investigative O 2 measurements are made at each laterallocation ahead of the A2 lateral. These investigative O 2measurements are made using a portable O 2 analyzerper Sections 12 and 13.17.4 At S1 and S 2, similar O2 contamination events areobserved as compared with points A 2 and A 3. Further,no lateral line flow changes (due to tool gas demandcycles in those laterals) cause any change in the O2level.17.5 At the third lateral, sampled as S 3 in Figure 1, theO 2 level is significantly higher (ranging between 510ppb), with periodic spikes of 50100 ppb. At this point,it is observed that when the usage in lateral S 3 drops tozero (a dead leg condition), analyzers A 2 and A 3 showO 2 readings above the contaminant signature. It istherefore deduced that the S3 lateral is the source of theatmospheric leak.17.6 By correlating the O 2 data at S3 with the gas usagefrom the tools on this lateral, the leak source can befurther traced within this lateral. (Refer to Figure 2.) Figure 2Branch UHP Gas Line with Ambient Air Leak Contaminating Sub-Main Line

SEMI F35-0304 © SEMI 1998, 20047 17.6.1 When Tool-1, Tool-2, or Tool-3 demands gas,the O 2 reading drops in proportion to the total flow ofgas in the lateral line. The higher flow rates act to dilutethe effects of the leak source and thus lower the O2reading at S 3 .17.6.2 It is observed that when Tool-5 demands gas,there is no change in the O 2 reading at S3. Therefore, itis deduced that the leak source is located further outalong the lateral line.17.6.3 When Tool-4 demands gas, it causes a moresignificant drop in the O 2 reading at S3. Further, it isobserved that the time required for the analyzer torespond after Tool-4 begins demanding gas correlatesto the time needed for the analyzers sample flow aloneto purge down the lateral line volume up to theanalyzer, when Tool-1, -2, and -3 are not demandinggas.17.6.4 This deductive inference technique pinpoints theleak source to the Tool-4 lateral line.17.6.5 After Tool-4 has stopped demanding gas (yetbefore any other Tools on this lateral demand gas), theO 2 reading at S3 continues to drop gradually overseveral minutes. It then gradually begins to elevate onceagain. This indicates that the actual leak is not veryclose to the connection of Tool-4 at the lateral line. Itsuggests more that the leak source is closer to the toolitself.17.7 A final investigative sample point is selectedalong the line leading to Tool-4. This is shown as S 4 inFigure 2. It is observed that the O 2 readings drop to0.20.5 ppb when Tool-4 demands gas. S4 begins toshow an O 2 elevation after the Tool-4 stops demandinggas. This concludes that the leak source is originatingfrom Tool-4 itself. 18 Related Documents18.1 SEMI StandardSEMI E49.8  Guide For High Purity And UltrahighPurity Gas Distribution Systems In SemiconductorManufacturing EquipmentNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions.

SEMI F36-0299 (Reapproved 1104)GUIDE FOR DIMENSIONS AND CONNECTIONS OF GASDISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS This standard was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility of theNorth American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on July 11, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to be publishedNovember 2004. Originally published in 1993; last published February 1999. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this guide is standardization ofdimensional and mechanical/electrical connectionattributes for components used within gas distributionsystems. Standardization of these component interfaceswill allow for interchangeability of gas distributionsystem components. Filters/purifiers, shut-off valves,pressure regulators, MFC/MFMs, and pressuretransducers are the types of gas distribution componentsthat would benefit from being interchangeable. 2 Scope2.1 This guide is for use with 1/4-inch distributionsystems at operating pressures no greater than 345 kPa(50 psi).2.2 The guide includes the following items:2.2.1 Physical characteristics specific to eachcomponent. These include a generalized drawing of thecomponent, specific end-to-end lengths for each type ofend connection, maximum envelope dimensions, base-to-centerline dimensions, tolerances, and bottommounting information.2.2.2 Electrical connections specific to eachcomponent, where applicable. These include pin-outsand types of connectors.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This guide is not intended to dictate how to build agas distribution system, but to allow forinterchangeability of components. 3.2 This standard does not include recommendationsfor sensor-bus compliant interfaces.3.3 This standard does not apply to surface mountcomponents used in modular type gas systems. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 None. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 component an individual piece or a completeassembly of individual pieces capable of being joinedwith other pieces or components.5.1.2 filter  a porous device, generally constructed ofpolymer, metal, or ceramics and housed in a metalchamber, which traps particles, preventing them frombeing transported downstream.5.1.3 mass flow controller (MFC)  a self-containeddevice (consisting of a transducer, control valve, andcontrol and signal-processing electronics) commonlyused in the semiconductor industry to measure andregulate the mass flow of gas.5.1.4 mass flow meter (MFM)  a self-containeddevice, consisting of a mass flow transducer and signal-processing electronics, commonly used in thesemiconductor industry to measure the mass flow ofgas.5.1.5 pressure regulator  a valve designed to reducea high incoming pressure (for example, from a cylinder)to a lower outlet pressure by automatically opening toallow flow until a desired, preset pressure on the outletside is reached, then automatically throttling closed tostop further pressure increase.5.1.6 pressure transducer a component whichmechanically or electrically senses gas pressure.

SEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104)METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESSPARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS This guideline was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility ofthe North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on July 11, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to be publishedNovember 2004. Originally published February 1999. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this test method is to define amethod for determining numerical values for surfaceroughness parameters measured on gas distributionsystem components. Application of this method isintended to yield comparable data among users of thismethod. 2 Scope2.1 This document will specify methods, measuringequipment, and test conditions for mechanical profilesurface roughness measurement of gas distributionsystem components. This test method will not requirenor recommend numerical values for specific surfaceroughness parameters. This test method is intended foruse in quality control and process development forspecification of and manufacturing of gas distributionsystem components.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Numerical values for specific surface roughnessparameters obtained using this test method may notprovide sufficient information for determining theperformance of the component, such as dry down times,corrosion resistance or amount of particle generation.Surface roughness measurement is one of manyevaluation techniques for assessing the performance orquality of a surface. This document is not concernedwith characteristics such as component design, material,dimensions, appearance, etc. While surface defectstraversed by the stylus may be included in theroughness measurement, this method does not governthe evaluation of surface defects. Surface defects maybe measured by methods such as SEM and EDX. Thistest method is intended to measure surface features onthe order of 10 m in size. It is not intended to detectsubmicron surface features. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 ASME Standards1 B46.1  Surface Texture (Surface Roughness,Waviness, and Lay)4.2 ASQ Standards2 Z1.9  Sampling Procedures and Tables for Inspectionby Variables for Percent NonconformingNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms5.1.1 EDX  Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy5.1.2 SEM  Scanning Electron Microscopy5.1.3 SEM  Scanning Electron Microscope5.2 Definitions5.2.1 cutoff  a length selected to limit the spacing ofsurface irregularities.

Waviness may result from suchfactors as machine or workpiece deflections, vibrations,chatter, heat treatment, or warping strains. Roughnessmay be considered as superimposed on a wavysurface. 6 Sampling6.1 Acceptability criteria should be specified by theuser and be developed in accordance with publishedsampling plans such as ASQ Z1.9, SamplingProcedures and Tables for Inspection by Variables forPercent Nonconforming. 7 Apparatus7.1 The instrument should be a stylus type as definedby ASME B46.1, Section 2. Due to the limitations ofskidded instruments (Type IV and V), a skidlessinstrument (Type I) is preferable.7.2 The instrument should be calibrated using standardlaboratory practices and manufacturer'srecommendations with a roughness metrology standardcalibrated by a certified testing laboratory and traceableto NIST3.7.3 In order to resolve the features of the surface, astylus with a conical tipped radius of 5 m (200 in)should be used. 3 National Institute of Standards and Technology, 100 Bureau Drive,Stop 3460, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-3460, (301) 975-6478,http://www.nist.gov/ 8 Units of Measure8.1 Surface roughness should be described by means ofthe Roughness Average, Ra, as defined per ASMEB46.1.8.2 Measurements should be specified in micro-meters(m) or microinches (in). 9 Preparation of Apparatus9.1 The surface should be clean and free from loosedebris before taking a measurement.9.2 The instrument should be sufficiently isolated fromvibrations, which will artificially increase roughnessmeasurements.9.3 Surfaces inaccessible to the stylus probe may beexposed by sectioning a sample(s). Samples should besectioned to avoid damage to the surface to bemeasured and should be cleaned appropriately toremove sectioning debris. 10 Procedure10.1 Select a single random location for measurementwithin each distinct region of interest on eachcomponent.10.2 Measurements shall be taken perpendicular to thelay.

12 Precision and Accuracy12.1 Some variance in Roughness Average is to beexpected on a single surface from measurement tomeasurement. No two measurements (as taken bydifferent operators, on different instruments, or atdifferent locations on the surface of a component) willcontain the same data points. Because differentinstruments will acquire data points at different rates,and evaluation lengths may differ, a typical RoughnessAverage measurement can include hundreds to tens ofthousands of data points. Reported measurements onthe same surface can be expected to deviate up to 20%. 13 Related Documents13.1 ANSI Standard4 Y14.36  Surface Texture Symbols13.2 BSI Standard5 BS 1134  Assessment of Surface Texture, Part 1:Methods and Instrumentation and Part 2: Guidance andGeneral Information13.3 DIN Standard6 DIN 4768  Determination of Surface RoughnessValues Ra, Rz, Rmax with Electric Stylus Instruments13.4 ISO Standard7 ISO 4288  Rules and Procedures for the Mea-surement of Surface Roughness Using StylusInstruments13.5 JIS Standard8 JIS B 0651  Instruments for the Measurement ofSurface Roughness by the Stylus Method 4 American National Standards Institute, Headquarters: 1819 LStreet, NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA.

SEMI F38-1104 © SEMI 1999, 20041 SEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104)TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USEGAS FILTERS This test method was technically reapproved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on August 16, 2004. Initially available on www.semi.org September 2004; to bepublished November 2004. Originally published June 1999. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this document is to define acomprehensive standard test sequence to qualify theparticle filtration efficiency achievable using Point-of-Use (POU) gas filters. 2 Scope2.1 This test method defines an evaluation method forPoint-of-Use filters of various media (e.g., metallic,ceramic, and polymeric) typically used for filteringinert and process gases in semiconductor applications.Point-of-Use filters are designed to handle relativelylow flow rates (0.5  50 slm.) and moderately highpressure drops. The filter housing and filtrationelement are combined into one sealed and inseparableunit.2.2 This test method is intended to demonstrate theability of a Point-of-Use gas filter to equal or exceed aspecific particle filtration efficiency class whenchallenged with a monodispersed aerosol in the sizerange described in Section 6.6.2.2.1 The efficiency class of the test method is definedas the log reduction value (LRV), where LRV is theLog \[Input Concentration/System Background Level\].NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 These test methods do not apply to gas filtercartridges.3.2 These test methods do not apply to bulk gas filters.3.3 The various media (e.g., metallic, ceramic, andpolymeric) may have slightly different critical particlesizes (most penetrating particle sizes). Therefore, manychallenge tests have to be performed over a range ofparticle sizes to assure that the worst case challengehas been performed. 3.4 The efficiency test is for steady state flow androom temperature only. Comparison to efficiency inpulsed flow, elevated temperature etc., will have to bedeveloped separately.3.5 Statistical evaluation on the variability in efficiencyof a media type should be done with a valid samplesize. This evaluation is not within the scope of this testmethod.3.6 The upper concentration limit of the CNC asspecified by the manufacturer should not be exceeded.Exceeding the CNC concentration will understate thechallenge concentration due to coincidence counting,thus affecting filter efficiency calculations.3.7 This is not intended as a method for precisedetermination of filter efficiency. It is intended as ameans for determining if a filter has an efficiency equalto or better than an approximate nominal value.3.8 Commercially available radioactive neutralizershave pressure limitations. Users should be aware ofthese limits. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 None. 5 Summary of Method5.1 The test sequence consists of three steps:5.1.1 Static background with filter.5.1.2 Filter challenge with first monodispersed particlesize (see Section 6.6 for particle size test sequence).5.1.3 Filter challenge with subsequent monodispersedparticle sizes. 6 Apparatus and Facility6.1 Gas Source  Clean, dry gas (nitrogen or air) withless than 0.5 ppm moisture and less than 0.5 ppm totalhydrocarbons.6.2 Particle Detector  A condensation nucleuscounter (CNC) with a counting efficiency of 50% at0.01 micron, as reported by the manufacturer, isrecommended to measure total particle concentration ofparticles greater than 0.01 micron. The CNC must meet

Testing in a Class 100 area isrecommended but not required. Refer to Section 6.7 forinstallation precautions.6.4 Configuration for Efficiency Test  One exampleof the configuration is shown in Figure 1. The setupshown in Figure 1 is intended only as a guideline. Thissystem consists of: an aerosol generation system, aerosol concentration detectors, an air flow measuring system, a filter pressure drop sensor, and the test filters.6.5 Test Flow Rate  Maximum manufacturers ratedflow rate.6.6 Challenge Particle Sizes  Experimentation ofvarious media (e.g., metallic, ceramic, and polymeric)have resulted in most penetrating particle sizes rangingfrom 0.050.11 micron.1 2 3 4 6.6.1 Several monodispersed particle challenge testsshall be done over a range of particle sizes so thattesting at the most penetrating particle size isperformed. An electrostatic classifier must be used toproduce a monodispersed challenge.6.6.2 Due to the effects of particle loading in relationto filtration efficiency, a clean filter should be used foreach particle size challenge. The differential pressureacross the test filter should be continuously monitoredto eliminate the possibility of particle loading. Thefollowing particle increments are a guideline. Smallerincrements are achievable and are desirable.6.6.2.1 Challenge Particle Size In Microns: 1 Rubow, K.L., C.B.

This includes anyspecialized equipment or procedures recommended bythe CNC manufacturer. Every effort should be taken tominimize differences in the particle concentrations ofthe sampling volume relative to the actual test volume.Care should be taken to provide an adequate exhaustlength so that back diffusion of particles does not affectbackground at 2 times the sampling flow rate. Thislength will depend upon the particle concentration inthe ambient environment and on other factors.6.9 Test Particle  Solid non-volatile particles.Sodium chloride is recommended, but other particlescould be used such as polystyrene latex beads (PSL) ifsufficiently high concentrations can be generated. 7 Procedure7.1 Static Background Test7.1.1 Purge the system at a high velocity flush of 100slm or the maximum flow rate that the systemcomponents will allow.7.1.2 Purge the system at test flow rate (Section 6.5).Measure the particle concentration with clean gas todetermine the background concentration. Thebackground count is established when the counter hassampled a minimum of 3 scf (85 sl), and the arithmeticaverage during the last 3 scf (85 sl) of gas sampled is&lt;2 particles/scf (&lt;0.07 particles/sl). The sampleinterval shall be 1 minute in duration. Ensure that thebackground counts are stable or decreasing. Ifbackground cannot be achieved after 6 scf (170 sl) havebeen sampled, there may be a problem with the counteror test apparatus. Past experience has shown this to bean adequate volume of gas to give a satisfactory lowlevel background particle counts.7.2 Penetration Test
