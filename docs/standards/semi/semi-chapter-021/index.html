TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE OUTPUT POWER OF RF
GENERATORS USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
EQUIPMENT RF POWER DELIVERY SYSTEMS
This test method was technically approved by the Global Metrics Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Metrics  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North  American  Regional
Standards Committee on July 11, 2004.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> September 2004; to be published
November 2004.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  The  purpose  of  this  test  method  is  to  provide  an
accurate method for measuring the output power of RF
generators   used   in   RF   power   delivery   systems   for
semiconductor  processing  equipment  to  support  SEMI
E113.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This  test  method  specifies  the  testing  procedures
and  test  equipment  required  for  determining  the  true
output   power   (i.e.,   heating   power)   output   of   RF
generators.  This test method uses a calorimetric power
meter,  which  was  calibrated  previously  using  precise
DC substitution techniques as a reference standard.</li><li>2  The    primary    focus    for    this    test    method    is
semiconductor processing equipment including, but not
limited to, the following equipment types:
• Dry etch equipment, and
• Film deposition equipment (CVD and PVD).
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  This  test  method  is  meant  to  provide  a  general
means   of   measuring   the   true   output   power   of   RF
generators  operating  over  a  wide  range  of  frequency
and  power.  Limitations  in  the  frequency  and  power
coverage   of   this   method   are   determined   by   the
individual system components chosen.</li><li>2  This  test  method  assumes  that  the  transmission
system characteristic impedance is 50 Ω.</li><li>3  International, national, and local codes, regulations
and   laws   should   be   consulted   to   ensure   that   the

connect various parts of the RF power delivery system.
5. 2.2  calorimeter —   an   RF   power   measurement
instrument using differential temperature and mass flow
rate to determine true heating power.
5. 2.3  harmonic frequency — the harmonic frequencies
are  defined  as  integer  multiples  of  the  fundamental
frequency.  For example, the second harmonic of 13.56
MHz is 27.12 MHz.
5. 2.4  RF  generator  —  a  component  in  the  RF  power
delivery system used to develop RF energy.
5. 2.5  RF  termination  —  a  device  for  terminating  RF
transmission   systems,   and   converting   RF   electrical
energy into heat. RF terminations normally have values
that are the same as the characteristic impedance of the
transmission system.
5. 2.6  RF  load  —  another  term  used  to  describe  an  RF
termination.
6  Test Apparatus
6. 1  Calorimetric  Power  Meter  —  This  instrument  is
designed   to   be   used   in   conjunction   with   a   high
efficiency  water-cooled  RF  termination,  rated  for  the
maximum  power  output  of  the  RF  generator.  Typical
calorimetric  power  meters  use  internal  thermocouple-
or   thermistor-type   temperature   sensors,   a   precision
coolant  flow  meter,  and  processing  circuits  for  storage
of     calibration     constants     and     coolant     physical
characteristics.     Choose     instruments     capable     of
providing a power measurement accuracy of ± 1% after
calibration at a specific power level.
6. 2  Water-Cooled   RF   Termination   —   This   device
provides    a    low    VSWR    (i.e.,    high    return    loss)
termination  for  the  testing  of  the  RF  generator.  Use  an
RF termination sized appropriately for the RF generator
under  test.  Finally,  use  an  RF  termination  capable  of
dissipating  DC  energy,  without  damage  due  to  the
effects   of   electrolysis. The   return   loss   of   the   RF
termination,    including    the    interconnecting    cable
between  the  RF  generator  and  the  termination  shall  be
no  less  than  30  dB.  This  return  loss  ensures  maximum
power   transfer   between   the   RF   generator   and   the
calorimeter.
NOTE 1:  See  Section  7  for  safety-related  recommendations
related to RF terminations.
6. 3  Voltage  and  Current  Meters — These  meters  are
used to measure the voltage and current presented to the
calorimeter   load   during   the   DC   calibration   of   the
calorimeter.  These  instruments  shall  have  a  certificate
indicating NIST traceability.  Choose meters capable of
voltage  and  current  measurement  accuracy  of  less  than
0. 2%.
6. 4  Calibration Power Supply — This power supply is
used as a source of clean DC energy for the purposes of
calibrating  the  calorimetric  power  meter.    Use  a  power
supply sized for the calibration to be performed and that
provides a very stable output at all levels.
6. 5  Cables and Connectors — Various interconnecting
cables  are  required  to  perform  the  tests outlined  in  this
test  method.    These  include  low-loss  cables  to  connect
the  DC  power  source  to  the  measuring  instrument  and
to  the  RF  load,  in  addition  to  low-loss  RF  cables  and
connectors  to  connect  the  RF  generator  output  to  the
load.
6. 5.1  In  order  to  keep  cable  losses  to  a  minimum,
minimize the lengths of interconnecting cables.
6. 5.2  In  addition,  compensate  for  the  losses  associated
with interconnecting cables used.
NOTE 2:  For  example,  if  6  m  (20  feet)  of  #10  AWG  copper
wire is used to connect the DC supply to the calorimeter, this
wire will add approximately 0.04 Ω of resistance between the
DC  source  and  the  50  Ω  termination.  Using  a  DC  supply
voltage  of  500  V  terminated  by  50  Ω  (i.e.,  5  kW),  this  will
result in a loss of about 4 W in the copper wire.
6. 5.3  Adjust  the  reading  obtained  by  the  calorimeter
according to the cable loss value.
NOTE 3:  For   example,   suppose   that   an   RF   generator,
operating at 13.56 MHz and developing 3 kW is connected to
the  calorimeter  through  a  6  m  (20-foot)  length  of  RG-217/U
coaxial    cable.        RG-217/U    coaxial    cable    has    a    loss
specification of 0.41 dB per 30 m (100 feet) of cable at 13.56
MHz.  Therefore, for 6 m (20 feet) of cable, the loss would be
approximately  0.41/5,  or  0.082  dB.    If  the  RF  generator  is
developing  3  kW,  this  means  that  approximately  2.944  kW
would appear at the calorimeter due to the cable loss.
7  Safety Precautions
NOTE 4:  The  tests  described  in  this  test  method  involve
using  low-output  power  test  instrumentation  (typically  less
than 10 mW).
7. 1  Work  should  be  conducted  in  accordance  with
local      safety      requirements      and      test      device
manufacturer’s recommended safety procedures.
7. 2  The  area  immediately  surrounding  the  test  setup
should be kept free and clear of unnecessary equipment
and materials.
7. 3  Testing    personnel    should    ensure    they    have</p><p>SEMI E136-1104 © SEMI 2004 3
adequate  lifting  devices  for  large  weights  such  as  long
RF cables and generators themselves.
7. 4  Persons  performing  tests  should  determine  which
method  of  water  cooling  of  the  resistor  in  the  RF
termination  is  utilized  by  the  test  device  manufacturer
and should take steps to ensure safe use of the device.
7. 4.1  Cooling-water flow rates should be appropriate to
the  test  device  manufacturer’s  recommendations  for
cooling  of  the  power  load  level  being  tested.    Consult
the  RF  generator  operating  manual  load  specifications
for this information.
7. 4.2  An RF termination using internal resistor cooling
only  is  highly  recommended  because  such  resistors  (of
the  tubular  ceramic,  thin  film  type)  are  usually  cooled
by routing the coolant to the inside of the ceramic tube
and  away  from  the  resistive  film,  thereby  eliminating
the  possibility  of  electrolysis  affecting  the  resistive
film.
7. 4.3  In an alternative method, the coolant is routed on
both  the  inside  and  the  outside  of  the  resistor.    While
this  method  provides  for  more  efficient  cooling,  the
proximity   of   the   coolant   to   the   resistive   film   can
potentially result in damage to the resistive film caused
by  electrolysis  generated  by  the  DC  energy  passing
through the fluid in the termination.
7. 4.3.1  For this reason, if an RF termination using both
internal  and  external  cooling  is  used,  it  is  important  to
periodically   check   the   resistor for   damage   due   to
electrolysis.  This can be done easily by measuring the
resistance  of  the  load  resistor  using  a  simple  digital
multimeter.
7. 4.3.2  With the RF termination disconnected from the
RF  cable,  place  one  probe  on  the  center  conductor  of
the    termination,    and    the    other    probe    on    the
termination’s outer conductor.
7. 4.3.3  Measure  the  DC  resistance  of  this  path.    If the
DC resistance is more than 53 Ω, replace the resistor in
the termination.
7. 5  In  order  to  prevent  the  possibility  of  ground  loops
between  the  RF  generator  and  the  calorimeter  system,
be sure to operate the calorimeter and the RF generator
on the same AC supply.
8  Test Setup for RF Generator Power Output
Test
8. 1  The  test  setup  for  the  RF  generator  output  power
test  consists  of  the  RF  generator  connected  to  the
calorimeter  power  meter  through  a  length  of  coaxial
cable.
8. 2  Prior  to  making  any  measurements,  calibrate  the
calorimeter  power  meter  using  a  source  of  stable  DC
energy.
9  Test Procedure for Determining RF
Generator Output Power
9. 1  Calorimetric    power    meters    provide    excellent
reference  standards  for  the  measurement  of  RF  energy
in  that  they  are  capable  of  measuring  the  true  heating
power  of  a  waveform,  including  any  harmonic-  or
nonharmonic-related     frequency     components.     The
technique  employed  for  this  test  is  to  first  calibrate  the
calorimetric  power  meter  with  DC  energy,  which  can
be  very  precisely  determined.  Then,  use  two  digital
multimeters    (e.g.,    Fluke™    87    or    equivalent)    to
determine   the   actual   DC   power   applied   to   the
calorimeter.  Finally,  once  the  DC  calibration  has  been
performed  at  a  particular  power  level,  connect  the
output of the RF generator under test to the calorimeter
and measure the output power of the RF generator. The
basic  steps  involved  in  the  use  of  this  system  are
outlined below.
9. 2  Calibrate    the    Calorimeter — Calibrate    the
calorimeter with the stable DC power supply, using the
two  digital  multimeters  to  read  the  voltage  and  current
applied to the calorimeter’s RF load.
9. 3  Connections — Connect the DC power supply, the
digital   multimeters,   and   the   RF   load   according   to
Figures  1  and  2.    Make  the  connections  between  the
multimeters,  the  DC  power  supply,  and  the  RF  load
using   high-quality   low-loss   cable   and   high-quality
corrosion-free cable terminations.</p><p>Figure 1
Calorimeter Calibration Configuration</p><p>SEMI E136-1104 © SEMI 2004 4</p><p>Figure 2
Calorimeter Calibration Connection Diagram</p><ol start="9"><li><p>3.1  Use   a   calorimeter   equipped   with   a   coolant
system.
NOTE 5:  Most  calorimeter  systems  use  either  a  tap-water
coolant  system  or  a  recirculating  system  of  some  type.  Best
results  may  be  obtained  through  the  use  of  a  self-contained
heat exchanger and coolant recirculating system.</p></li><li><p>3.2  Make all of the electrical and coolant connections
to the calorimeter.</p></li><li><p>3.3  Apply main power to the calorimeter system and
allow one hour for stabilization.</p></li><li><p>3.4  Load     Differential     Temperature     —     Most
calorimeter  systems  will  yield  optimum  performance
when   certain   operating   parameters   relating   to   the
differential temperature across the RF load and the flow
rate   are   maintained.      In   most   cases,   a   differential
temperature  of  2°C  represents  a  good  beginning  point.
The  coolant  flow  rate  may  then  be  set  to  provide  for
this differential temperature.</p></li><li><p>3.4.1  The following formula may be used to arrive at
the correct coolant flow rate.
Power = 69.32 ×
∆T × Flow Rate      (1)
where:
Power is in W,
∆T is in °C, and
Flow Rate is in L/min.</p></li><li><p>3.4.2  Solving for flow rate yields:
Flow Rate = (Power / 69.32) /
∆T    (2)</p></li><li><p>3.5  Coolant Types — In most cases, the coolant used
in  calorimetric  power  measurement  systems  is  pure
distilled  water.  In  this  case,  most  modern  calorimeters
will  automatically  correct  for  changes  to  the  coolant
physical   characteristics   (e.g.,   specific   heat,   specific
gravity) as the coolant temperature changes.</p></li><li><p>3.5.1  If coolant other than pure water is used and the
calorimeter  chosen  will  not  automatically  compensate
for  changes  to  the  coolant,  adjust  the  power  readings
obtained for the effects of the coolant changes. Consult
the calorimeter operating manual for specific details.</p></li><li><p>3.6  Calorimeter    Calibration —    Following    the
calorimeter    warm-up,    the    device    is    ready    for
calibration.</p></li><li><p>3.6.1  With     the     calorimeter     operating     at     the
appropriate  flow  rate,  apply  DC  power  to  the  RF  load,
according  to  the  voltage  and  current  readings  obtained
with the two digital multimeters.</p></li><li><p>3.6.2  Multiply  the  voltage  reading  by  the  current
reading to obtain the power applied to the load.</p></li><li><p>3.6.3  Allow 15 minutes for the calorimeter reading to
stabilize.</p></li><li><p>3.6.4  Using    the    procedure    in    the    calorimeter
operating  manual,  set  the  calorimeter  such  that  the
calorimeter reading is exactly the same as that obtained
using the voltage and current meters.</p></li><li><p>3.6.5  At this point, add any offsets that are associated
with   interconnecting   cable   losses,   as   outlined   in
Sections 6.5.2 and 6.5.3.</p></li><li><p>3.6.6  The   calorimeter   is   now   calibrated   at   this
specific power level.
NOTE 6:  If a new power level is selected, repeat this process
in order to compensate for instrumentation linearity effects of
the calorimeter.</p></li><li><p>3.7  RF  Generator  Testing — With  the  calorimeter

to test the RF generator power output at this level.</p></li><li><p>3.8  Connections — Connect the RF generator output
to  the  RF  load  according  to  Figure  3.  Use  cables  and
connectors between the RF generator output and the RF
load  of  a  high-quality,  low-loss  type.    As  outlined
above,  some  power  will  be  lost  in  the  cables  between
the  generator  and  the  load.  Add  these  losses  as  offsets
to  the  calorimeter  reading,  in  order  to  obtain  the  total
power  output  of  the  generator.    Base  the  losses  upon
cable  length,  cable  type,  and  operating  frequency.  See
SEMI   E114   test   method   for   details   on   cable   loss
compensation.</p></li></ol><p>Figure 3

7  Assembly and Pre-Packaging Procedures
7. 1  Pre-Assembly
7. 1.1  Machining,  sawing,  welding,  brazing,  grinding,
sanding,      and      other      manufacturing      operations
incompatible  with  cleanrooms  should  be  completed
before components are brought into the clean assembly
area.
7. 1.2  All   SME   components   should   be   vacuumed,
blown off with filtered air, and cleaned with a solution
of  10  to  70%  IPA  diluted  in  UPW  using  wipes  and
swabs immediately prior to being brought into the clean
assembly area.
7. 1.3  Cutting oils, lubricants, and solder flux should be
removed  before  components  are  brought  into  the  clean
assembly area.
7. 2  Clean Assembly Area
7. 2.1  All components of the SME should be assembled
in  at  least  an  ISO  Class  6  or  better  (ISO  Class  5
preferred) cleanroom.
7. 2.2  A   set   of   clean   assembly   tools   should   be
maintained in the clean assembly area.
7. 2.2.1  If   this   is   not   possible,   tools   should   be
vacuumed, blown off with filtered air, and cleaned with
a  solution  of  10  to  70%  IPA  diluted  in  UPW  using
wipes  and  swabs  immediately  prior  to  each  time  they
reenter the clean assembly area.
7. 2.2.2  The  assembly  tools  in  the  clean  assembly  area
should  be  cleaned  periodically  and  as  needed  if  they
become contaminated during usage.
7. 3  Pre-Packaging
7. 3.1  All  SME  with  water  (including  UPW)  or  other
liquids  should  be  fully  emptied  and  completely  dried
using dry, hydrocarbon-free air or nitrogen.
7. 3.1.1  All   SME   with   UPW   that   comes   in   direct
contact  with  the  production  units  (e.g.,  wafers)  should
have  lines,  baths,  tanks,  etc.  flushed  with  a  bacteria
retardant  (e.g.,  H
2
O
2
solution,  iodine/UPW  solution)
before emptying them fully.
7. 3.2  All  utility  lines  should  be  capped  before  and
during shipment.
7. 3.3  The  SME  with  vacuum  chambers  should  have
these  chambers  and  vacuum  lines  sealed  and  shipped
under vacuum.
7. 3.4  The  SME  should  be  clearly  marked  showing
correct   lifting   points   for   removal   from   shipping
container.</p><p>SEMI E137-1104 © SEMI 2004 3
7. 3.5  Following  final  assembly  and  test,  all  exposed
surfaces  should  be  thoroughly  cleaned  with  a  solution
of  10  to  70%  IPA  diluted  in  UPW  using  wipes  and
swabs.
7. 3.6  The  SME  should  be  inspected  thoroughly  for
cleanliness.
7. 3.6.1  The  supplier  should  provide  a  copy  of  their
inspection   results   (e.g.,   marked   checklist)   with   the
SME.
8  Triple Wrap Strategy
8. 1  The  following  procedures  support  the  strategy  of
totally   enclosing   and   sealing   the   SME,   separate
subassemblies, or support components in three layers of
protective  wrapping  (see  Section  9)  so  that  each  layer
forms a protective seal against moisture and particles.
8. 2  Each   individual   wrap   layer   is   intended   to   be
removed  at  a  specific  stage  of  delivery  and  relocation
(see Section 16) adhering to the following guidelines.
8. 2.1  Inner  Wrap  —  This  inner  wrap  should  stay  with
the  SME,  separate  subassemblies,  and  components  all
the way into the final cleanroom or a staging area of the
same cleanliness level for wipe down. The wrap should
be cleaned prior to movement into the cleanroom.
8. 2.2  Middle  Wrap  —  This  middle  wrap  should  stay
with the SME, separate subassemblies, and components
until  they  reach  at  least  an  ISO  Class  7  intermediate
staging   area.   The   wrap   should   be   cleaned   before
leaving the customer’s loading dock/receiving area and
again before it is removed in the staging area.
8. 2.3  Outer  Wrap  —  This  wrap  is  used  to  protect  the
SME, separate subassemblies, and components while in
transit  to  the  loading  dock.  While  the  SME,  separate
subassemblies,  and  components  are  on  the  customer’s
loading    dock/receiving    area,    the    outer    shipping
materials  should  be  removed.  The  wrap  should  also  be
cleaned and removed.
9  Packaging Procedures
9. 1  Packaging  in  Clean  Assembly  Area  —  The  SME,
separate subassemblies, and components should then be
totally  enclosed  in  a  clean  polyethylene  inner  wrap
using tape as required.
9. 1.1  A humidity indicator should be included inside of
the initial wrapping layer.
9. 1.2  If  two  sets  of  pallets  are  used,  the  inner  pallet
should  also  meet  the  requirements  of  Section  10.2  and
should     be     enclosed     with     the     SME,     separate
subassemblies, and components.
9. 1.2.1  The   inner   pallet   should   be   clearly   marked
showing   correct   lifting   points   for   removal   from
shipping container.
9. 2  Packaging in Dedicated Clean Packaging Area  —
After  the  inner  (i.e.,  first)  wrap  is  applied,  the  SME,
separate   subassemblies,   and   components   should   be
relocated  to  a  dedicated  clean  (ISO  Class  7  or  better)
packaging area.
9. 2.1  SME,  separate  subassemblies,  and  components
should    then    be    totally    enclosed    in    two    more
independent  layers  (i.e.,  middle  and  outer  wraps)  of
clean polyethylene film using tape as required.
9. 2.2  After   the   SME,   separate   subassemblies,   and
components  are  triple  wrapped,  they  should  be  placed
on  a  pallet  (see  Sections  10  and  11)  so  that  the  triple
wrapping is not damaged or violated.
9. 2.2.1  The   pallet   should   be   movable   (with   SME,
separate  subassemblies,  and  components  attached  to  it)
with a conventional pallet jack or forklift.
9. 2.2.2  The     SME,     separate     subassemblies,     and
components  should  be  capable  of  placement  on  and
removal from the pallet with a conventional pallet jack
or  fork  lift  without  compromising  or  tearing  any  of  the
triple wrapping.
9. 3  After  placement  on  the  pallet,  the  SME,  separate
subassemblies, and components should be relocated to a
separate crating area.
10  Crating Procedures
10. 1  Design
10. 1.1  The    maximum    outside    crating    dimensions
should   be   sized   not   to   exceed   the   maximum   size
requirements for method(s) of shipment (e.g., airfreight,
air-ride trailers).
10. 1.1.1  Crating   shape   and   dimensions   should   be
optimized  to  obtain  transportation  cost  savings,  when

11  Packing and Securing Procedures
11. 1  All   units   of   the   SME   should   be   adequately
blocked  and  braced  by  foam  or  wood,  if  necessary  to
prevent   shifting   or   movement   during   handling   and
transportation.
11. 1.1  SME   mainframes   and   some   miscellaneous
components may require special brackets for bracing.
11. 2  All heavier items should be placed on the bottom
of  the  crate  with  lighter  and/or  more  fragile  items
placed near the top of the crate.
11. 3  Crates should not be over packed.
11. 4  All  main  SME  components  should  be  secured  on
a floating base with foam material of sufficient density
to support the weight either in the deck or in the skid.
11. 4.1  For  SME  that  is  deemed  of  lower-value  and/or
as less-sensitive to handling, a nonfloating base may be
used.  However,  all  other  material  requirements  should
remain the same.
11. 5  The  foot  or  base  of  the  SME  should  be  bolted
against the crate’s base, if possible.
11. 6  For land and/or air shipment, the SME should be
• Wrapped with bubble pack,
• Wrapped with polyethylene stretch wrap, and
• Placed in a barrier bag.
11. 7  For ocean shipment, the SME should be
• Wrapped with bubble pack,
• Wrapped with polyethylene stretch wrap,
• Placed  in  a  barrier  bag  with  activated  desiccant
distributed  as  evenly  as  possible  between  barrier
bag  and  stretch  wrap  at  the  rate  of  1  g/L  (1  oz/ft
3
)
with   the   SME   volume   deducted   from   the   air
volume   when   calculating   required   amount   of
desiccant, up to a maximum of 9.1 kg (320 oz), and
• Vacuum sealed in the barrier bag in ≤5 minutes to
minimize exposure of the desiccant to open air.
11. 8  Feet   or   levelers   from   any   frame   or   SME
component should not be removed.
11. 9  SME  on  casters  (i.e.,  pivoting  rollers)  should  be
blocked  up,  keeping  the  casters  clear  of  the  crate,  to
prevent  damage  to  casters  and  to  keep  them  from
wearing through the crate’s base.
11. 10  All  support  hardware  or  separate  components
(e.g.,   cables,   spare   parts)   should   be   packaged   in
separate containers from the main unit.
12  Monitoring Device Installation Procedures
12. 1  Shock  indicators  should  be  mounted  on  both  one
end  and  one  side  on  the  outside  of  the  crate  at  a  top
corner.
12. 1.1  Shock  indicators  should  be  glued  to  the  crate
and coated with lacquer so they cannot be peeled off or
knocked off.
12. 2  Additional  disposable  shock  indicators  should  be
mounted  on  both  one  end  and  one  side  inside  of  the
crate  at  a  top  corner  on  the  floating  base,  barrier  bag,
packing material, or SME itself for SME more sensitive
to handling, as required.
12. 2.1  If  shock  indicators  are  mounted  inside  of  the
crate, their locations should be marked on the outside of
the crate.
12. 2.2  Nondisposable   shock-measurement   recording
equipment may be substituted.
12. 3  Tilt  indicators  should  be  mounted  on  both  the
inside and the outside of the crate.
12. 3.1  Tilt indicators on the outside should be glued to
the  crate  and  coated  with  lacquer  so  they  cannot  be
peeled off or knocked off.
12. 4  Disposable      high-temperature      and/or      low-
temperature indicators should be placed inside the crate
for    SME    components    sensitive    to    temperatures
potentially encountered during shipment or storage.
12. 4.1  Nondisposable            temperature-measurement
recording equipment may be substituted.

14  Packing List Procedures
14. 1  The  packing  list  should  be  affixed  to  exterior  of
the crate in a weatherproof holder.
14. 2  The     packing     list     should     specify     what
component(s)  of  the  SME  each  crate  and  container
holds.
15  Transportation Procedures
15. 1  For   shipment   over   land,   the   SME   should   be
transported  in  vehicles  with  air-ride  suspension  for  all
support axles (e.g., with air-ride trailers).
15. 2  The trailer should have no holes to the exterior in
the floor, walls, or roof.
15. 3  Shipping  containers  should  be  secured  using  bars
and/or straps connected to the trailer.
15. 4  If  a  shipping  container  is  neither  a  wooden  crate
nor    a    cardboard    box    (e.g.,    bubble    pack),    then
transportation  provider  should  supply  and  wrap  the
shipping  container  in  clean  protective  covers  and/or
pads.
15. 4.1  The    transportation    provider,    supplier,    and
customer should keep the protective covers and/or pads
on the shipping containers during all phases of loading,
shipment, and unloading.
15. 5  Shipping  containers  should  not  be  stacked  (i.e.,
top loaded).
16  Unloading, Unpacking, and Relocation
Procedures
16. 1  The supplier should provide their requirements to
the customer for correctly unloading the SME from the
vehicle, unpacking it, and relocating it from the loading
dock/receiving   area   to   its   final   location   in   the
cleanroom.
16. 2  The  supplier  should  work  with  the  customer  and
the movers to review and agree on their SME relocation
plan.
16. 3  The crating and the monitors should be inspected
for  any  damage  or  indications  of  mishandling  and
conditions recorded.
16. 4  The  outer  shipping  materials  (e.g.,  crates,  bubble
pack)   should   be   carefully   removed   on   the   loading
dock/receiving  area  to  prevent  damage  to  the  triple
wrapping.
16. 5  The outer wrap should be cleaned and removed on
the loading dock/receiving area.
16. 6  The  middle  wrap  should  be  cleaned  before  the
SME,  separate  subassemblies,  or  support  components
leave the loading dock/receiving area.
16. 7  The   SME,   separate   subassemblies,   or   support
components  should  be  relocated  to  the  at  least  ISO
Class 7 intermediate staging area.
16. 8  The  middle  wrap  should  be  cleaned  again  before
it is removed in the intermediate staging area.
16. 9  The  middle  wrap  should  be  carefully  removed  in
the intermediate staging area.
16. 10  The  inner  wrap  should  be  cleaned  before  the
SME,  separate  subassemblies,  or  support  components
leave the intermediate staging area.
16. 11  The  SME,  separate  subassemblies,  or  support
components  should  be  relocated  to  the  final  cleanroom
or  a  final  staging  area  of  the  same  cleanliness  level  as
the cleanroom.
16. 12  The inner wrap should be cleaned again before it
is removed in the final cleanroom or a final staging area
of the same cleanliness level as the cleanroom.
16. 13  The  inner  wrap  should  be  carefully  removed  in
the  final  cleanroom  or  a  final  staging  area  of  the  same
cleanliness level as the cleanroom.
16. 14  The  humidity  indicator  should  be  inspected  and
the reading recorded.
16. 15  If  the  inner  wrap  is  removed  in  a  final  staging
area,   the   SME,   separate   subassemblies,   or   support
components    should    be    relocated    into    the    final
cleanroom location for installation.</p><p>SEMI E137-1104 © SEMI 2004 7
17  Inspection Procedures
17. 1  The  customer  should  inspect  external  surfaces  of
the   SME,   separate   subassemblies,   and/or   support
components  for  cleanliness  after  removal  of  the  inner
wrapping.
17. 1.1  If  the  SME,  separate  subassemblies,  or  support
components   fail   the   cleanliness   inspection,   supplier
should  reclean  the  failed  areas  and  pass  a  cleanliness
reinspection prior to start of installation.
17. 2  The  customer  should  provide  the  supplier  with  a
completed copy of their cleanliness inspection results.

GUIDE TO CALCULATE COST OF OWNERSHIP (COO) METRICS FOR
GAS DELIVERY SYSTEMS
This guide was technically approved by the Global Metrics Committee and is the direct responsibility of the
North  American  Metrics  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  North  American  Regional  Standards
Committee  on  December  10,  2004.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  February  2005;  to  be  published
March 2005.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  The purpose of this guide is to provide standard cost of ownership (COO) metrics for evaluating unit production
cost effectiveness of gas delivery systems in the semiconductor industry.</li><li>2  This  guide  also  illustrates  how  to  apply  the  COO  metrics  to  gas  delivery  systems.    Users  should  be  able  to
calculate the COO for any piece of gas delivery equipment using this guide.
NOTE 1:  A spreadsheet (Microsoft® Excel) has been provided as an illustrative example.</li><li>3  The  guide  establishes  a  well-defined  procedure  to  facilitate  an  understanding  of  equipment-related  costs  by
providing definitions, classifications, algorithms, methods, and default values necessary to build a full or constrained
COO calculator.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This guide defines a COO metric that can be applied to any gas delivery system.  Some terms are specialized to
integrated circuit wafer and device production, but may be adapted for other applications.
NOTICE:  This  guide  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  guideline  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  Effective  building  of  a  COO  model  requires  identification  of  constraints  and  data  values.    Example  data  is
provided in this document and may be updated periodically.  Where possible, use direct values for inputs rather than
deriving them from secondary models or using example values.</li><li>2  Certain factors are more difficult than others to accurately determine.  Figure 1 depicts the relationship of some
of the COO factors to ability to collect and validate information.  The accuracy of a COO calculation may be prone
to a variety of errors or omissions.</li></ol><p>Figure 1

5  Terminology
5. 1  Abbreviations and Acronyms
5. 1.1  COO — Cost of ownership
5. 1.2  CYL — Cost of yield loss
5. 1.3  DLY — Defect limited yield
5. 1.4  ER — Equipment required (integer number)
5. 1.5  EY — Equipment yield
5. 1.6  PLY — Parametric limited yield
5. 1.7  PRY— Product yield
5. 1.8  PU — Production utilization (total)
5. 1.9  TP — Throughput
5. 2  Definitions
5. 2.1  baseline cost of ownership — a constrained version of cost of ownership (COO) that only includes equipment
yield <!-- -->[i.e., defect limited yield and parametric limited yield are not included]<!-- -->.
5. 2.2  comprehensive cost of ownership — cost of ownership (COO) calculated with no constraints.
5. 2.3  constrained  cost  of  ownership  —  cost  of  ownership  (COO)  version  with  a  set  of  defined  restrictions  to
facilitate comparisons or to remove ambiguity.
5. 2.4  consumable —  part  of  the  piece  of  equipment  that  is  worn  out  by  the  process  operation  of  the  piece  of
equipment and requires replacement after less than one year of operation.
5. 2.5  cost footprint — the area (A) of the smallest horizontal rectangle that contains all of the shadow footprint and
half of the easement space around the piece of equipment.  This is calculated as:
()
[]
()
[]
DeDsDeWeWsWtA−+×−+=2/12/1                                                              (1)
()()DsDeWsWe+×+=4/1
where:
De = Depth of the piece of equipment
Ds = Combined depth of the piece of equipment and easement space
We = Width of the piece of equipment
Ws = Combined width of the piece of equipment and easement space
5. 2.6  cost of ownership (COO) — full cost of embedding, operating, and decommissioning in a factory environment
equipment needed to accommodate the required volume of production units.</p><p>SEMI E140-0305 © SEMI 2005 3
5. 2.7  cost of yield loss (CYL) — a unit lost at the end of a given step represents the loss of the cost of the starting
unit and the manufacturing to that point.  In addition, units leaving a step may be lost at some later step.  Calculating
CYL  therefore  requires  knowing  the  accumulated  cost  of  manufacturing  before  the  unit  is  lost.    Therefore,  CYL
should be tracked as a separate cost for factory optimization.
5. 2.8  default or  default  value  —  a  value  to  be  used  if  actual  data  are  not  available.    Also  called  example  value.
Where possible, actual data should be used in COO calculations.
5. 2.9  defect limited yield (DLY) — the fraction of units that are not lost from defects added by the equipment.  For
wafer processing, defect yield is usually derived from a model.
5. 2.10  easement space — the floor space that must remain clear to the rear and sides of the piece of equipment (but
not  in  front  of  the  load  face  plane).    This  includes  safety  aisles,  ergonomic  maintenance  access  space,  component
removal space, and room for doors to swing out.
5. 2.11  equipment  required  (ER)  —  the  integer  number  of  pieces  of  equipment  required  to  obtain  the  production
throughput required for the step.
5. 2.12  equipment throughput — see throughput.
5. 2.13  equipment yield (EY) — the percentage of units received by the piece of equipment that can be passed to the
next  step  based  on  any  criteria  such  as  damaged  units,  or  units  determined  to  be  defective  by  inspection  or  test.
Inclusion of equipment yield results in a decreasing population of units flowing through the factory.  At later steps,
equipment  will  process  fewer  units  than  the  full  factory  unit  starts.    For  test  equipment,  validly  rejected  units  are
scrap, but not a component of equipment yield.
5. 2.14  fixed costs — costs incurred once and usually associated with the acquisition and incorporation of a piece of
equipment into the factory.
5. 2.15  lifetime — the time over which the fixed and recurring costs are spread on an annualized basis.
5. 2.15.1  production lifetime — the number of years a piece of equipment is used for manufacturing.
5. 2.15.2  tax  lifetime  —  the  number  of  years  as  defined  in  compliance  with  local  tax  or  accounting  depreciation
practices.
5. 2.16  material — bulk gas, specialty gas, or general or specialty chemical used in the process.  Includes monitor
units consumed in the support of the piece of equipment.
5. 2.17  monitor unit — test or filler unit (e.g., wafer or device) consumed in the support of the piece of equipment.
Also called test unit.
5. 2.18  operational  uptime  (OU)  —the  percentage  of  time  the  piece  of  equipment  is  in  a  condition  to  perform  its
intended  function  during  the  period  of  operations  time.    This  calculation  is  intended  to  reflect  overall  operational
performance for a piece of equipment (SEMI E10).
5. 2.18.1  Discussion  —  As  defined,  OU  has  components  attributable  to  both  the  unit  manufacturer  and  to  the
equipment supplier.
5. 2.19  parametric limited yield (PLY) — the fraction of units that are not lost from device parameters being outside
the required range.
5. 2.20  product yield (PRY) — the fraction of units that pass through the factory and result in good product.  Product
yield for units is the composite of all sources of yield loss.
5. 2.21  recurring cost — cost that is incurred on an ongoing basis based on time and/or usage.
5. 2.22  repair part — component to service the piece of equipment purchased at the time of repair.
5. 2.23  service  contract  —  an  agreement  for  the  supplier  to  provide  equipment  service  or  maintenance  under
specified terms and conditions beyond that which is supplied with the piece of equipment.
5. 2.24  shadow footprint — the area of the floor space directly under every part of the piece of equipment during its
operation.  This area includes any temporary projections from the piece of equipment during loading or processing</p><p>SEMI E140-0305 © SEMI 2005 4
(e.g., carriers that stick out from the piece of equipment or equipment load ports that protrude only when the piece of
equipment is being loaded).
5. 2.25  spare part — prepurchased inventory of a part maintained to service the piece of equipment.
5. 2.26  supplier —  provider  of  equipment  or  services  to  the  unit  manufacturer.    Also  called  equipment  vendor  or
equipment manufacturer.
5. 2.27  test unit — see monitor unit.
5. 2.28  throughput (TP) — the number of units (e.g., wafers, devices) per hour the piece of equipment delivers to the
factory, including all input, output, and internal overhead operation.  TP includes all test or monitor units processed,
since the cost of these nonproduct units is accounted for directly.
5. 2.29  unit — any wafer, die, packaged device, or piece part thereof (includes product and nonproduct units).
5. 2.30  volume  requirement  —  the  number  of  units  required  to  be  processed  by  the  equipment  in  a  specific  time
period, normally units per week.
5. 2.31  yield — see product yield.
6  Description of COO Model
6. 1  COO Model Calculation — The formula for calculating COO is given in Equation 2.
COO = (F$ + R$ + Y$) / (L × TP × PRY × OU) (2)
where
F$    =    annualized fixed costs, $
R$    =    annualized recurring costs, $
Y$    =    annualized    yield costs (CYL), $
L =   lifetime of piece of equipment, yrs
TP    =    throughput,    units/yr
PRY =    product yield, dimensionless
OU   =   operational uptime, dimensionless
6. 1.1  F$ is calculated by summing the fixed cost categories F
ij
in Table 1 in SEMI E35.
6. 1.2  R$ is calculated by summing the recurring cost categories R
ij
in Table 2 in SEMI E35.
6. 1.3  Y$ is calculated by summing the recurring scrap cost categories in Table 3 in SEMI E35.
6. 1.4  The parameters L and TP are input directly into the model.
6. 1.5  The model calculates PRY from user inputs on numbers of wafers lost due to EY, DLY, and PLY.
6. 1.6  The model calculates OU from inputs for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance (including assists), standby
time, qualification time, engineering time, and the scheduled production hours.
6. 1.6.1  While  the  cost  terms  used  specific  currency  units  of  dollars  as  an  example,  any  currency  may  be  used  as
long as it is applied consistently throughout the model.</p><p>SEMI E140-0305 © SEMI 2005 5
RELATED INFORMATION 1
COST OF OWNERSHIP
NOTICE:    This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E140  and  was  derived  from  North  American
Metrics  Committee.    This  related  information  was  approved  for  publication  by  full  letter  ballot  on  December  10,</p><h1>2004</h1><ol start="2004"><li>R1-1  Sample Input to Model
R1-1.1  To effectively illustrate use of the COO model, it was run with a hypothetical set of input data.  This input
data is listed in Table 1.  When studying this example, the user should remember that parameter values are for the
gas delivery system only, not the entire process piece of equipment.
R1-2  Sample Model Output
R1-2.1  The model calculates each term in the numerator of Equation 2 and then sums these results and divides by
the denominator to get COO.  To enhance the user’s understanding of the components of COO, Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5
and  the  spreadsheet  show  interim  results.    For  the  set  of  inputs  listed  in  Table  1,  F$  are  shown  in  Table  2,  R$  are
shown  in  Table  3,  and  Y$  are  shown  in  Table  4.    Each  of  these  terms  is  calculated  from  the  cost  factors  listed  in
SEMI E35.  The italicized rows in Tables 2, 3, and 4 correspond to these cost factors and show the subtotal for that
cost factor.  The breakdown for each cost factor is shown in the rows below it.
R1-2.2  Tables 2, 3, and 4 show costs for years 1 through 7.  The last year is based on user input.  It is the longest of
useful life or depreciable life.  In the example shown, depreciable life was set to 7 years and useful life was set to 5
years.    The  depreciable  life  was  deliberately  made  longer  than  the  useful  life  to  illustrate  the  feature  of  the
spreadsheet  that  allows  these  two  parameter  values  to  differ.    This  often  occurs  in  practice  since  a  piece  of
equipment is sometimes “obsoleted” before it is fully depreciated.  The user can enter any value up to 10 for these
two parameters.
R1-2.3  Table 5 shows the COO results.

future   integrated   circuit   (IC)   manufacturing.   Important   parameters,   which   are   typically   measured   for   the
characterization  and  qualification  of  device  manufacturing  steps,  are  the  thickness  and  the  optical  properties  of
fabricated  layers  and  the  critical  dimensions  (CD)  of  submicron  structures.  For  the  measurement  principle  of
ellipsometry,  which  is  commonly  applied  in  both  applications,  different  equipment  and,  hence,  procedures  and
notations for data acquisition and modeling exist. If, therefore, ellipsometry is to be applied for integrated metrology
equipment, the physical and the software integration into the equipment should be standardized to avoid efforts for
specific installations depending on the equipment and fabrication environment.</li><li>2  The  description  of  the  mechanical  integration  of  an  ellipsometer  into  an  equipment  module  (e.g.  a  front  end
module or an equipment chamber) comprises the
• specification  of  the  ellipsometer  equipment  and  the  spatial  arrangement  of  the  ellipsometer  modules  and
components,
• specification of the relative position of the ellipsometer equipment to the equipment module, and
• specification of the mechanical interfaces to the equipment module.</li><li>3  A prerequisite for a standardized software integration of an ellipsometer is the standardized notation of the layer
counting method, the measurement parameters, the measurement data, and the measurement results. This document
describes  the  position  of  the  metrology  equipment  with  respect  to  the  sample.  The  position  of  the  measurement
position (i.e. the position of the measurement spot) refers to the description of the wafer surface coordinate system
as described in SEMI M20.</li><li>4  The  purpose  of  this  standard  is  to  provide  a  guide  for  a  unique  specification  of  the  most  commonly  applied
ellipsometer equipment, the comprised modules and components, and their spatial arrangement. In this standard, the
notation  for  parameters  required  in  data  acquisition  and  modeling  is  specified,  and  a  unique  notation  for  remote
access  on  measurement  parameters,  data,  and  results  is  provided.  Derived  from  these  definitions,  the  required
parameters  to  identify  the  calibration  status  of  an  ellipsometer  are  specified.  Additionally,  recommendations  for
preferred physical units are given.</li><li>5  The standard is intended for use in integrated metrology, but may also be applicable for stand-alone metrology.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This standard covers reflection ellipsometric measurements in integrated metrology.</li><li>2  The standard covers the typical applications of ellipsometry, which are the determination of layer thickness and
optical properties.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  The standard is limited to the measurement technique of ellipsometry although definitions may be applicable to
the measurement technique of polarimetry.</li></ol><p>SEMI E141-0705 © SEMI 2005 2
3. 2  The  standard  is  limited  to  the  measurement  of  isotropic  samples.  It  is  limited  to  the  application  of  Stokes
vectors, Jones-, or Muller - matrix formalisms for the mathematical treatment of the sequence of optical components
(see ¶7.6).
3. 3  The ellipsometer equipment differs in the capability to measure all elements of the Stokes vector.
3. 4  The ellipsometer equipment differs in the capability to measure the number of unknown optical properties of a
sample and in their capability to measure critical dimension parameters.
3. 5  This standard does not address the calibration procedures of ellipsometer equipment.

6  Ellipsometer Equipment
6. 1  Ellipsometer Equipment Specification
6. 1.1  In the reflection ellipsometric measurement, a light beam with known state of polarization is directed towards
a  specular  reflecting  sample  surface.  The  change  in  both  the  amplitude  and  phase  of  the  oscillating  parallel  and
perpendicular  vector  components  of  the  electric  field  associated  with  the  beam  are  measured  after  reflection  from
the  surface  as  the  complex  amplitude  reflectance  ratio  (i.e.  a  change  in  the  polarization  of  the  light  beam  occurs).
There are several possible configurations for ellipsometer equipment, which can be described by the arrangement of
modules that comprise the optical components required to perform the ellipsometric measurement. In addition, the
optical components also induce changes in the polarization of the light beam.
6. 1.2  For  specification  of  the  ellipsometer  equipment,  it  is  necessary  to  describe  all  modules  and  optical
components included both in the measuring and in the reflection process from the sample system and their position
within  a  coordinate  system  defined  by  the  sample  and  the  light  beam.  Additionally,  information  on  the  number  of
wavelengths used for measurement and the method of data acquisition must be provided. The following definitions
are provided for ellipsometer equipment specification.

and reflected beam, respectively.
6. 2.1.1  polarizer module — Arrangement of optical devices that generates a light beam of well-defined known state
of  polarization  for  interacting  with  the  sample  system.  The  polarizer  module  includes  the  polarizer  device  and  the
light source and may also include the compensator or modulator.
6. 2.1.2  analyzer module — Arrangement of optical devices that allows measurement of the state of polarization of
the light beam after reflection from the sample system. The analyzer module may also include the compensator or
modulator,
and the detector.
6. 2.1.3  incident  beam  —  The  light  beam  that  passes  from  the  light  source  through  the  polarizer  module  on  the

polarization during the measurement.
6. 3.1.1  polarizer  (P)  —  Component  that  transmits  light  with  a  preferred  polarization  axis  (typically  linearly
polarized).</p><p>2 SEMATECH Official Dictionary, Rev 5.0, SEMATECH Inc., 2004 (Available through <a href="http://www.sematech.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.sematech.org</a>).

6. 3.1.2  rotating  polarizer  (RP)  —  Component  that  transmits  light  with  a  preferred  polarization  axis  (typically
linearly polarized) and that is rotating during measurement.
6. 3.1.3  compensator (retarder) (C) — Component that can add a phase shift between the components of the electric
field (i.e. the field component parallel to the plane of incidence and perpendicular to the beam direction and the field
component perpendicular to the plane of incidence and to the beam direction, respectively) (see ¶6.4.2.3–¶6.4.2.6).
6. 3.1.4  rotating  compensator  (retarder)  (RC)  —  A  rotating  component  that  can  add  a  phase  shift  between  the
components of the electric field (i.e., the field component  parallel to the plane of incidence and perpendicular to the
beam  direction  and  the  field  component  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of  incidence  and  to  the  beam  direction,
respectively) (see ¶6.4.2.3–¶6.4.2.6).
6. 3.1.5  birefringence  modulator  (BM)  —  Component  that  can  add  a  time-modulated  phase  shift  between  the
components of the electric field (i.e. the field component parallel to the plane of incidence and perpendicular to the
beam  direction  and  the  field  component  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of  incidence  and  to  the  beam  direction,
respectively) (see ¶6.4.2.3–¶6.4.2.6). The photoelastic modulator (PEM) is a component of this type.
NOTE 1:  A PEM is an electro-optical modulator made of a suitable birefringent material. By applying an external electric field
to this material, its refractive index changes anisotropically, thus resulting in a phase shift of a transmitting light wave. By driving
the electric field resonantly, the phase of one polarization component of the transmitting light wave will be delayed periodically.
6. 3.1.6  analyzer  (A)  —  Component  that  transmits  light  with  a  preferred  polarization  axis  (typically  linearly
polarized).
6. 3.1.7  rotating  analyzer  (RA)  —  Component  that  transmits  light  with  a  preferred  polarization  axis  (typically
linearly polarized) and that is rotating during measurement.
6. 3.1.8  sample (S) — Material or layer system to be analyzed. The sample is the reflecting component that changes
the state of polarization in a characteristic manner (typically, light is elliptically polarized after reflection) and that is
to be evaluated.

7  Definitions for Modeling the Reflection from a Sample Surface
7. 1  Analysis of Ellipsometric Measurements
7. 1.1  For the analysis of ellipsometric measurements an optical model describing the optical parameters and layer
thickness  values  of  the  sample  must  be  provided.  The  optical  model  is  regarded  as  part  of  the  necessary  substrate
data set
4
. The objective of the ellipsometric measurement is to determine the value of at least one parameter within
the  optical  model  such  that  the  measurand  calculated  from  the  optical  model  is  in  optimum  consistency  with  the
measurand  (raw  data  value
1
)  determined  in  the  measurement.  For  a  correct  optical  model  and  in  the  absence  of
measurement  errors,  the  measurand  calculated  from  the  optical  model  coincides  with  the  measurand  (raw  data
value
1
) determined in the measurement.
7. 1.2  The  set  of  adjusted  parameter  values  is  the  measurement  result  (i.e.  the  converted  measurement  data
1</p><p>determined by the ellipsometric measurement). In some special cases the measurement result can be calculated from
the measurands or raw data analytically.
7. 1.3  Typically, in ellipsometry the analysis is performed by calculating the expected value of the measurand (i.e.
raw data value from the parameter values provided in the optical model). The parameter values of interest within the
optical model are then intentionally adjusted in a manner such that optimum consistency between the calculated and
measured  value  of  the  measurand  (i.e.  the  raw  data  value  is  obtained).  The  adjusted  parameter  values  are  the
measurement result (i.e. the converted measurement data).
7. 2  Definition of the Optical Parameters — The optical parameters are used as substrate data set and the optimized
parameter  values  after  measurement  and  analysis  denote  the  measurement  result  (i.e.  the  converted  measurement
data).
7. 2.1  layer  index  (i)    —  The  layer  index  i  identifies  the  layer  for  remote  access.  The  index  i  =  ‘a’  describes  the
ambient  medium  (n
a
, k
a
).  The  index  i  =  ‘s’  describes  the  substrate  medium  (n
s
, k
s
).  The  intermediate  layers  are
numbered in the direction from the substrate to the ambient (i.e. i = 1 denotes the first layer on the substrate) (see
Figure 2).
7. 2.2  n
i
— Denotes the refractive index of layer i being a positive real number.
7. 2.3  k
i
— Denotes the extinction coefficient of layer i. The value of the extinction coefficient k
i
must be set as a
positive  number  |k
i
|  for  better  readability  in  programs  and  printouts,  independently  of  the  notation  of  the  complex
refractive index and complex dielectric function (see ¶¶7.2.4, 7.2.6, and 7.2.7).
NOTE 3:  The  extinction  coefficient  k  describes  absorbing  media  if  |k|  &gt;  0  and  transparent  media  if  |k|  =  0.  The  absorption
coefficient
α  and  the  absorption  index  κ  are  also  two  common  optical  parameters  used  for  describing  absorbing  media.  The
extinction coefficient k is related to the absorption coefficient
α by α = 4πk/λ and to the absorption index κ by κ = k/n.
7. 2.4  N
i
—  Denotes  the  complex  refractive  index  of  layer  i.  Depending  on  the  physical  notation  the  complex
refractive index is calculated by N
i
= n

(see  ¶7.2.4,  ¶7.2.5).  The  value  of  the

| for better readability in programs
and  printouts,  independently  of  the  notation  of  the  complex  refractive  index  and  complex  dielectric  function  (see
¶¶7.2.3, 7.2.4, and 7.2.5).
7. 2.8  t
i
— Metric thickness of the layer i. The method for counting is identical as for the refractive indices, but no
thickness is provided for the ambient and the substrate.
7. 3  ambient  medium  —  The  modeling  always  requires  a  semi-infinite  space  (or  material)  for  the  incident  and  the
reflected beam that is not part of the sample. The ambient is the propagation medium immediately before and after
reflection at the sample surface. In many cases the ambient medium is air or vacuum with n
a
= 1 and k
a
= 0.</p><p>4 Terminology here is as defined in SEMI E127.</p><p>SEMI E141-0705 © SEMI 2005 7
7. 4  material and layer definition — the optical properties of a material determine how the complex refractive index
N
i
is  given  as  a  function  of  wavelength  and  environmental  parameters  (e.g.,  temperature).  A  layer  consists  of  a
single  material  or  a  combination  of  several  materials  with  a  metric  thickness  t
i
.  This  definition  also  applies  to
complex structures as index gradients, interfaces, and roughness that can be modeled as a series of layers.
7. 5  substrate medium — Lowest (see ¶7.2.1) material involved in the reflection with a complex refractive index N
s
.
A sample has only one substrate material, which is treated as semi-infinite.

NOTE 6:  The   reference   samples   are   typically   certified   thickness   standards   using   reference   materials.   For   thickness
measurements typical samples are thermal oxides on silicon ranging from 4 nm to 800 nm. For refractive index measurements,
the reference sample thickness is typically in the range from 80 nm to 500 nm.
NOTE 7:  SEMI  MF576-01  was  originally  published  by  ASTM  International  as  ASTM  F  576-78.  It  was  formally  approved  by
ASTM balloting procedures and adhered to ASTM patent requirements. Though ownership of this standard has been transferred
to  SEMI,  it  has  not  been  formally  approved  by  SEMI  balloting  procedures  and  does  not  adhere  either  to  SEMI  Regulations
dealing with patents or to SEMI Editorial Guidelines. It was available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>, last published by ASTM International as
ASTM F 576-01. Hence in SEMI MF576-01, the notation for parameters required in data acquisition and modeling is aligned but
could  not  retroactively  be  fully  harmonized  with  the  definitions  specified  in  the  presented  guide.  This  does  not  constitute  any
constraints since these few parameters may easily be superseded by the newer definitions provided.
7. 7.2  Whenever  the  thickness  and  refractive  index  measurement  (if  performed)  is  within  specified  limits  for  the
reference  sample,  the  ellipsometer  is  defined  as  qualified  and  hence  capable  of  measuring  the  respective  type  of
sample.
7. 7.3  The  qualification  status  of  an  ellipsometer  is  defined  and  must  be  specified  by  providing  the  following
parameters: (1) the relevant parameters for sample identification, (2) the relevant optical parameters of the sample,
(3)  the  expected  measurement  result,  (4)  the  actual  measurement  result,  (5)  the  tolerated  deviation  between  the
actual and the expected measurement result, (6) all relevant parameters of the ellipsometer system (e.g. all relevant
parameters  of  the  positions  of  the  optical  components)  the  angle  of  incidence,  and  (7)  all  relevant  environmental
parameters.

TRANSFER (SECS-I)
This  standard  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Information  &amp;  Control  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Information  &amp;  Control  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the
North  American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  February  28,  1999.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>
May 1999; to be published June 1999. Originally published in 1980; previously published January 1999.
1  Introduction</p><ol><li>1  Revision History — This is the  first major revision
since the original release of SECS-I in 1980. Very little
of  the  original  intent  of  SECS-I  has  been  altered,
although  there  are  a  few  significant  additions.  The
changes    are    summarized    in    Appendix    1.    This
specification  has  been  developed  in  cooperation  with
the Japan Electronic Industry Development Association
Committee 12 on Equipment Communications.</li><li>2    Scope   —   The   SECS-I   standard    defines   a
communication  interface  suitable  for  the  exchange  of
messages between semiconductor processing equipment
and   a   host.   Semiconductor   processing   equipment
includes  equipment  intended  for  wafer  manufacturing,
wafer   processing,   process   measuring,   assembly   and
packaging.   A   host   is   a   computer   or   network   of
computers    which    exchange    information    with    the
equipment  to  accomplish  manufacturing.  This  standard
includes   the   description   of   the   physical   connector,
signal levels, data rate and logical protocols required to
exchange  messages  between  the  host  and  equipment
over  a  serial  point-to-point  data  path.  This  standard
does  not  define  the  data  contained  within  a  message.
The  meaning  of  messages  must  be  determined  through
some    message    content    standard    such    as    SEMI
Equipment Communications Standard E5 (SECS-II).</li><li>3   Intent  —  This  standard  provid es  a  means  for
independent    manufacturers    to    produce    equipment
and/or  hosts  which  can  be  connected  without  requiring
specific knowledge of each other.</li><li>3.1   Layered  Protocol  —  The  SEC S-I  protocol  can
be  thought  of  as  a  layered  protocol  used  for  point-to-
point communication. The levels within SECS-I are the
physical  link,  block  transfer  protocol,  and  message
protocol. (See Related Information R1-1.1.)</li><li>3.2   Speed  —  It  is  not  the  intent  of   this  standard  to
meet    the    communication    needs    of    all    possible
applications. For example, the speed of RS-232 may be
insufficient  to  meet  the  needs  of  transferring  mass
amounts  of  data  or  programs  in  a  short  period  of  time,
such as might be required by high speed functional test
applications.</li><li>3.3    Network   Support   —   The   meth od   by   which
blocks of data are routed to a piece of equipment or find
their  way  back  to  the  proper  host  application  is  not
specified by SECS-I. In a network, the roles of host and
equipment   might   be   assumed   by   any   party   in   the
network.     In     this     situation,     one     end     of     the
communications   link   must   assume   the   role   of   the
equipment and the other the role of the host.</li><li>4  Applicable Documents</li><li>4.1  Electronics Industries Associa tion Standards

Standard 2 — Message Content (SECS-II)
SEMI  E6  —  SEMI  Facilities  Interface  Specification
Format</li><li>5   Overview  of  SECS-I  —  The  SE CS-I  standard
defines point-to-point communication of data utilizing a
subset of the international standard known in the U.S.A.
as  EIA  RS-232-C  and  in  Japan  as  JIS  C  6361  for  the
connector  and  voltage  levels.  The  actual  transmission
consists  of  8-bit  bytes  sent  serially  with  one  start  and
one  stop  bit.  The  communication  is  bidirectional  and
asynchronous, but flows in one direction at a time. The
direction  is  established  by  special  characters  and  a
handshake,  after  which  the  data  itself  is  sent.  Data  is
sent in blocks of 254 bytes or less. Each block consists
of  a  10-byte  header  followed  by  data.  A  message  is  a
complete  unit  of  communication  in  one  direction  and
consists  of  1  to  32,767  blocks.  Each  block  header
contains information for identifying the block as part of
a  specific  message.  Messages  are  paired  by  a  request
and its reply which together are called a transaction.</li><li>6    Structure   of   Document   —   This    document   is
divided into sections which correspond to major aspects
of  the  standard.  The  sections  outline  requirements  as
well  as  implications  of  the  requirements.  The  standard
may  be  implemented  in  a  variety  of  ways,  depending
upon  the  computer  environment  where  it  is  placed.
Implementation is not part of the standard. Information
which  may  be  useful  for  implementation  is  included  in
the form of Related Information.

3  Coupling
3. 1   Coupling  refers  to  the  physica l  interface  at  the
equipment.  The  host  will  provide  compatible  signals  at
this  point.  No  restrictions  are  implied  for  any  interface
other than for equipment covered by this standard.
3. 2  Electrical Interface — The co nnection will include
a  serial  interface  according  to  EIA  Standard  RS-232-C
for   interface   Type   E,   full   duplex   communication,
modified  by  the  deletions,  additions  and  exceptions
described in this section.
3. 2.1    Connector   —   Either   the   9-pin    or   25-pin
connector described in the EIA RS232  may be used. In
the case of the 25-pin connector a female connector will
be mounted on the equipment and a male connector will
be  mounted  on  the  cable  from  the  host.  In  the  case  of
the 9-pin connector the male connector will be mounted
on   the   equipment   and   a   female   connector   will   be
mounted on the cable. The connector on the equipment
will have female 4-40 threaded jack screw locks.
NOTE:  Suitable  25-pin  connectors  known  as  Type  &quot;D&quot;  are
similar  to  Amphenol  MIN  RAC  17  series  with  jack  screw
locks.   Suitable   9-pin   connector   is   also   Type   &quot;D&quot;   with
jackscrew  locks.  It  is  the  type  commonly  implemented  on
desktop and notebook PCs.
3. 2.2   Signal  Pins  —  Pins  on  the  con nector  have
functions  as  defined  in  Table  1.  Pins  1,  2,  3,  and  7  of
the  25-pin  connector  or  pins  3,  2,  and  5  of  the  9-pin
connector  are  required  for  all  equipment  complying
with  SECS-I.  When  using  a  25-pin  connector,  the  two
power supply pins, 18 and 25, are optional as indicated.
Any other pins, if used, shall comply with the RS-232-
C standard.

rates  of  19,200  and  150  baud  may  be  supplied  if
desired.
3. 4  Physical Medium — The conn ection with the host
may involve any medium that provides the required RS-
232-C  quality,  signal  levels  and  data  rate  at  the  equip-
ment  connector.  The  quality  of  signal  should  be  such
that the effective bit error rate is less than 1 × 10
-6
. This
rate  can  be  achieved  easily  with  hardwired  systems.
The distance limits specified in RS-232-C apply only to
systems  using  the  wiring  technique  described  in  RS-
232-C.  Since  any  method  may  be  used  in  SECS-I  as
long as RS-232-C signals are supplied at the connector,
the distance and isolation is dependent upon the design
of the physical medium which is external to the SECS-I
standard. (See Related Information R1-2.)
4  Character Structure
4. 1  Characters — Data will be tra nsmitted or received
in  a  serial  bit  stream  of  10  bits  per  character  at  one  of
the specified data rates. The standard character has one
start  bit  (0),  8  data  bits  and  one  stop  bit  (1).  All  bit
transmissions are of the same duration. The 8 data bits
are numbered from 1 to 8 in the order sent (see Figure
1). The timing between characters is asynchronous with
respect  to  the  data  rate.  The  8  data  bits  may  be  any
arbitrary  code.  The  eight  data  bits  will  hereafter  be
referred to as a byte.
Figure 1
Character Structure
4. 2   Weighted  Codes  —  For  bytes  h aving  weighted
codes, bit one is the least significant and bit eight is the
most  significant.  The  most  common  weighted  code  is
binary.
4. 3    Non-Weighted   Codes   —   For   c odes   without
numeric  value  such  as  ASCII,  the  bit  numbers  will  be
used   as   the   entry   into   a   standard   code   table   for
interpretation of the code. SECS-I performs no parity or
other verification of the contents of individual bytes.
5  Block Transfer Protocol
5. 1   The  procedure  used  by  the  seri al  line  to  establish
the   direction   of   communication   and   provide   the
environment  for  passing  message  blocks  is  called  the
block   transfer   protocol.   Most   of   the   protocol   is
accomplished  with  a  handshake  of  single  bytes.  When
both  ends  of  the  line  try  to  send  at  the  same  time,  a
condition known as line contention exists. The protocol
resolves  contention  by  forcing  one  end  of  the  line,
designated  as  the  slave  (always  the  host),  to  postpone
its    transmission    and    enter    the    receive    mode.
Retransmission     of     blocks     is     used     to     correct
communication  errors.  The  block  transfer  protocol  is
shown  in  flow  chart  form  in  Figure  2,  and  described
below.   Additional   information   is   also   contained   in
Related Information R1-3 and R1-4.
5. 2  Handshake Bytes  —  The  four   standard  handshake
codes  used  in  the  block  transfer  protocol  are  shown  in
Table 2. The three letter names, ENQ, EOT, ACK, and
NAK  correspond  to  the  ASCII  code  having  the  same
pattern.

NAK00010101Incorrect Reception
5. 3   Timeout  Parameters  —  Timeo uts  are  used  to  de-
tect  communications  failures.  A  timeout  occurs  when
the  measured  time  between  two  events  exceeds  a  pre-
determined  limit.  Generally,  the  length  of  time  that
must pass before it can be assumed that an error has oc-
curred  depends  upon  the  particular  systems  involved.
The time required in one situation might be excessively
long  in  another.  Thus,  the  timeout  values  must  be
&quot;tuned&quot;  to  meet  the  application.  In  the  block  transfer
protocol, there are two situations requiring timeout val-
ues.  The  two  timeout  values  are  called  parameters  T1
and T2.
5. 3.1    Inter-Character   Timeout,   T1   —    The   inter-
character timeout, T1, limits the time between receipt of
characters within a block after the length byte has been
received  and  until  the  receipt  of  the  second  checksum
byte.
5. 3.2   Protocol  Timeout,  T2  —  The  p rotocol  timeout,
T2, limits the time between sending ENQ and receiving
EOT,  sending  EOT  and  receiving  the  length  byte,  and
sending  the  second  checksum  byte  and  receiving  any
character.</p><p>SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 19995
5. 4   Retry  Limit,  RTY  —  The  retry   limit,  RTY,  is  the
maximum number of times the Block Transfer Protocol
will attempt to retry sending a block before declaring a
failed send. (See Section 5.8.2.)
5. 5   Master/Slave  —  The  master/sl ave  parameter  is
used in the resolution of contention (see Section 5.8.2).
The  host  is  designated  as  the  slave.  The  equipment  is
desig-nated  as  the  master.  This  convention  is  based
upon  the  assumption  that  the  equipment  is  less  able  to
store messages than the host.
5. 6   Block  Lengths  —  The  unsigne d  integer  value  of
the  first  byte  sent  after  receipt  of  EOT  is  the  length  of
the  block  being  sent.  The  length  includes  all  the  bytes
sent  after  the  length  byte,  excluding  the  2  bytes  of  the
checksum.   The   maximum   block   length   allowed   by
SECS-I is 254 bytes, and the minimum is 10 bytes.
5. 7   Checksum  —  The  checksum  is   calculated  as  the
numeric  sum  of  the  unsigned  binary  values  of  all  the
bytes after the length byte and before the checksum in a
single  block.  The  checksum  is  sent  as  16  bits  in  two
bytes following the last byte of the block data. The high
order  eight  bits  of  the  checksum  will  be  sent  first,
followed  by  the  low  order  eight  bits.  The  checksum  is
used  by  the  receiver  to  check  for  transmission  errors.
The  receiver  performs  the  same  checksum  calculation
on the received header and data.
5. 8   Algorithm  —  The  operation  of   the  block  transfer
protocol is best understood by following the logic flow
in Figure 2. This flow chart depicts the operation of the
five  states  of  the  protocol  -  Receive,  Idle,  Send  Line
Control, and Completion. The flow chart shown in Fig-
ure 2 is not meant to imply that a particular implemen-
tation  is  required  under  this  standard.  However,  any
SECS-I block transfer protocol implementation must in-
clude  all  the  logic  described  in  Figure  2.  The  same
algorithm  is  executed  on  each  end  of  the  SECS-I
communications link.
5. 8.1   Idle  State  —  Both  ends  of  the   communications
link are assumed to start in the Idle state. There are two
primary  activities  of  the  protocol  signified  by  the  two
exits from the Idle state. These are:
A.   SEND — a message block is to be sent.
B.    RECEIVE — the other end of the communications
link has a message block to send
5. 8.2   Line  Control  —  The  line  contr ol  section  estab-
lishes  the  transmission  direction,  resolves  contention,
and  handles  retries.  When  an  ENQ  is  received  in  the
Idle state, the Line Control responds with an EOT if the
Block Transfer Protocol is ready to receive. The Block
Transfer  Protocol  then  goes  to  the  Receive  state.  If  a
message block is to be sent, then an ENQ is sent. If an
EOT is received in response to the ENQ within the time
limit  T2,  the  Block  Transfer  Protocol  goes  to  the  Send
state.
5. 8.2.1  If the slave receives an ENQ in  response to the
ENQ, contention has occurred. The slave postpones the
send  of  its  block  until  it  receives  a  block  from  the
master.  The  slave  prepares  to  receive  the  incoming
block  and  sends  an  EOT.  When  the  block  transfer
protocol  returns  to  the  Idle  state,  the  postponed  block
Send may be sent as if it were a new send request. After
a  master  sends  an  ENQ,  it  can  ignore  all  characters
except  an  EOT.  After  a  slave  sends  at  ENQ,  it  can
ignore all characters except an ENQ or EOT.
5. 8.2.2   When  the  time  between  sendin g  ENQ  and
receiving EOT exceeds T2, or the time between sending
the  second  checksum  byte  and  receiving  any  character
exceeds T2, or a non-ACK character is received within
time  T2  after  sending  the  second  checksum  byte,  the
Line  Control  will  increment  the  retry  count  (&quot;tries&quot;  in
the  flowchart).  If  the  retry  count  does  not  exceed  the
value  of  the  RTY  parameter,  then  the  Block  Transfer
Protocol  will  retry  sending  the  block  beginning  with
ENQ.  If  the  retry  count  does  exceed  the  value  of  the
RTY parameter, then a failed send has occurred.
5. 8.3  Send — Once a send state is es tablished, the first
byte sent is the length, N, of the data in the block. After
N  more  bytes  have  been  sent,  the  two  bytes  of  the
checksum are sent. The sender computes the checksum
based on the data in the block and the block header, but
not the length byte. When the sender receives the ACK
before  time  T2,  the  block  is  deemed  properly  sent.
However,  if  the  sender  receives  a  non-ACK  character
before  time  T2,  or  no  character  within  time  T2,  it
returns  to  the  line  control  state  for  a  possible  retry.  In
the  Send  state,  characters  received  prior  to  sending  the
last checksum byte can be ignored.
5. 8.4   Receive  —  Once  a  receive  stat e  is  established,
the   first   byte   received   is   the   length   byte,   N.   The
receiver  counts  and  saves  the  following  N  +  2  bytes.
The  last  two  bytes  are  the  checksum.  The  receiver
compares  the  two  checksum  bytes  against  its  own
computation  of  the  checksum.  In  a  good  block,  the
computed and received checksum are the same.
5. 8.5  Receive Completion — After a  block is correctly
received,  an  ACK  character  is  sent  and  the  message
protocol is notified that a block has been received. If T2
is exceeded while waiting for the length character, or Tl
is exceeded between characters being received, then an
NAK  is  sent.  If  the  length  byte  is  invalid  or  if  the  re-
ceived  checksum  does  not  agree  with  the  computed
checksum, the receiver continues to listen for characters
to  ensure  that  the  sender  is  finished  sending.  This  is
detected  when  the  inter-character  time  exceeds  T1,  at
which point the receive is aborted and a NAK is sent. In</p><p>SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 19996
any  case  when  an  NAK  is  sent,  the  receiver  may  dis-
card any data it has received for the block. The receiver
returns  immediately  to  the  Idle  state  after  sending  an
ACK or NAK.
5. 8.6  Send Completion  —  After  the   second  checksum
byte is sent, if an ACK is received within time T2, the
message protocol is notified that the send was success-
ful.  If  a  failed  send  occurs,  the  message  protocol  is  in-
formed  of  the  failure.  Application-level  software  must
take the possibility of a send failure into account.

6  Header Structure
6. 1   The  operation  of  all  communic ations  functions
above    the    block    transfer    protocol    is    linked    to
information  contained  in  a  10-byte  data  element  called
the  header.  The  header  is  always  the  first  10  bytes  of
every  block  sent  by  the  block  transfer  protocol.  The
information  in  the  header  is  also  used  by  the  message
protocol (see Section 7). The fixed format of the header
is described in this section. The general header structure
is shown in Figure 3.
NOTE:  The  header  also  contains  information  required  by
SECS-II.
6. 2   Reverse  Bit  (R-Bit)  —  The  rev erse  bit  (R-bit)
signifies the direction of a message. The R-bit is set to 0
for messages to the equipment and set to 1 for messages
to  the  host.  The  R-bit  is  included  in  the  header  so  that
the direction of the message is contained in every block.
Figure 3
Block Header Structure
Table 3  Influence of the R-BIT
R-BitDevice IDMessage Direction
0DestinationHost to Equipment
1SourceEquipment to Host
6. 3  Device ID — The device ID d efines the source or
destination of the message depending upon the value of
the R-bit as shown in Table 3. Device identification is a
property   of   the   equipment   and   must   be   settable
according to Section 8. The host can view the device ID
as a logical identifier connected with a physical device
within the equipment. The host has no device ID.
6. 4  Wait Bit (W-Bit) — The wait b it (W-bit) is used to
indicate that the sender of a primary message expects a
reply. A value of one in the W-bit means that a reply is
expected.  A  value  of  zero  in  the  W-bit  means  that  no
reply  is  expected.  The  W-bit  must  be  set  to  zero  in  all
secondary   messages.   For   multi-block   messages,   the
sender  must  ensure  that  the  W-bit  is  the  same  in  every
block of the message.
6. 5   Message  ID  —  The  message  I D  identifies  the
format  and  content  of  the  message  being  sent  (the
particular  message  is  one  of  many  possible  for  the
device   in   question).   The   exact   message   content   is
equipment-dependent.  The  upper  message  ID  is  the
most significant portion of the ID.
6. 5.1   Primary  Message  —  A  primar y  message  is
defined   as   any   odd   numbered   message.   An   odd
numbered message will have bit 1 of the lower message
ID set to 1.
6. 5.2   Secondary  Message  —  A  seco ndary  message  is
defined  as  any  even  numbered  message.  An  even-
numbered message will have bit 1 of the lower message
ID set to 0.
NOTE:  In  SECS-II,  byte  three  of  the  header  (excluding  the
W-bit) is known as the stream, and byte four of the header is
known as the function. See SECS-II for more information.
6. 6   End  Bit  (E-Bit)  —  The  end  bit   (E-bit)  is  used  to
determine  if  a  block  is  the  last  block  of  a  message.  A
value of one in the E-bit means that the block is the last
block.  A  value  of  zero  means  that  more  blocks  are  to
follow.
6. 7   Block  Number  —  A  message  s ent  as  more  than
one  block  is  called  a  multi-block  message.  The  first
block  is  given  a  block  number  of  one,  and  the  block
number  is  incremented  by  one  for  each  subsequent
block  until  the  entire  message  is  sent.  The  blocks  of  a
multi-block message are sent in order. In a single-block
message, the block number must have a value of zero or
one. The maximum block number is 32,767. The upper
block  number  is  the  most  significant  portion  of  the
block number. (See also 7.2.)
6. 8  System Bytes — The system by tes in the header of
each  message  for  a  given  device  ID  must  satisfy  the
following  requirements.  (For  a  further  discussion  of
system bytes, see Related Information R1-5.)</p><p>SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 19998
6. 8.1   Distinction  —  The  system  byt es  of  a  primary
message  must  be  distinct  from  those  of  all  currently
open  transactions  initiated  from  the  same  end  of  the
communications  link.  They  must  also  be  distinct  from
those  of  the  most  recently  completed  transaction.  (See
Section  7.3.)  They  must  also  be  distinct  from  any
system  bytes  of  blocks  that  were  not  successfully  sent
since the last successful block send.
6. 8.2  Reply Message — The system  bytes of the reply
message are required to be the same as the system bytes
of the corresponding primary message.
6. 8.3  Multi-Block Messages — The  system bytes of all
blocks of a multi-block message must be the same.
7  Message Protocol
7. 1  A message is a complete unit o f communication in
one  direction.  The  message  protocol  uses  the  services
of  the  block  transfer  protocol  to  send  and  receive
messages.  The  message  consists  of  the  message  data
together with the following information from the header
—  R-bit,  device  ID,  W-bit,  message  ID,  and  system
bytes.
7. 2   Message  Send  —  When  a  mes sage  is  ready  to  be
sent,  the  message  send  protocol  performs  the  functions
described  below.  A  block  send  failure  terminates  the
message protocol action on that message.
7. 2.1  Message Length — The maxim um data length in
a single block of a message is 244 bytes. The maximum
number  of  blocks  that  can  be  sent  in  a  multi-block
message  is  32,767,  and  so  the  maximum  data  length
allowed in one message is 244 ×  32,767 bytes.
7. 2.2   Message  Blocking  —  Message   blocking  is  the
division  of  the  message  data  into  blocks  to  be  sent  to
the Block Transfer Protocol. For best performance, it is
recommended,  but  not  required,  that  the  sender  fill  all
blocks  of  a  multi-block  message,  except  possibly  the
last  block,  with  the  maximum  254  bytes.  The  receiver
of  a  multi-block  message  should  be  able  to  accept  any
block size from 11 to 254 bytes, and should not require
consecutive blocks necessarily to be the same size.
7. 2.2.1   Certain  older  implementations   may  impose
application-specific  requirements  on  block  sizes  for
certain  incoming  messages.  Beginning  with  the  1988
revision  of  the  standard,  new  applications  may  not
impose  application-specific  requirements  on  incoming
block   sizes.   Applications   implemented   before   1988
may impose such requirements.
NOTE:  In  SECS-II,  certain  messages  are  defined  as  single-
block messages and must be sent as a single block in SECS-I.
7. 2.3  Header  —  The  message  proto col  must  establish
the  header  in  each  block  of  the  message  according  to
the requirements of Section 6.
7. 2.4   Interleaving  Messages  —  This   standard  allows,
but  does  not  require,  the  support  of  more  than  one
concurrent  open  transaction.  This  standard  allows,  but
does  not  require,  the  support  of  interleaving  the  blocks
of  different  multi-block  messages.  (See  documentation
requirements in 9.)
7. 3    Transactions   —   A   transaction    is   a   primary
message   and   an   optional   corresponding   secondary
message  is  called  the  reply.  A  transaction  is  opened
when   a   primary   message   is   ready   to   be   sent.   A
transaction  is  closed  when  the  last  block  of  a  primary
message requesting no reply has been sent, or when the
last block of the reply has been received.
7. 3.1  Reply Linking — When a reply  is expected for a
primary  message,  the  message  protocol  starts  the  reply
timer  for  the  transaction  after  the  last  block  of  the
message  is  successfully  sent.  When  a  primary  message
is sent for which a reply is requested, an expected block
is  established  for  the  message  receive  algorithm.  (See
Section   7.4.)   The   expected   block   will   have   the
complement of the R-bit, will have the same device ID,
will be the first block of a secondary message, and will
have  the  same  system  bytes  as  those  of  the  given
primary message.
NOTE:  In  SECS-II,  the  reply  will  have  the  same  upper
message  ID  (stream),  and  the  lower  message  ID  (function)
will  either  be  one  greater  than  that  of  the  corresponding
primary message, or it will be zero.
7. 3.2  Reply Timeout, T3 — The repl y timeout, T3, is a
limit  on  the  length  of  time  that  the  message  protocol  is
willing to wait after the last block of a primary message
has been sent and before the arrival of the first block of
the  reply.  If  the  first  block  of  the  reply  does  not  arrive
within the T3 limit, the expected block is removed from
the   list   of   expected   blocks,   and   the   transaction   is
aborted.  A  timer,  called  the  reply  timer,  is  used  to
measure the time between the last block of the primary
message  and  the  first  block  of  its  reply.  Each  open
transaction  for  which  a  reply  is  expected  requires  a
separate reply timer.
7. 4    Message   Receive   —   Each   bloc k   successfully
received by the block transfer protocol is passed to the
message protocol. It is the task of the message protocol
to identify the blocks and assemble them into the proper
message.
7. 4.1   Routing  Error  —  When  a  piec e  of  equipment
receives  a  block  of  data  which  has  a  device  ID  in  the
block  header  which  does  not  match  its  own  device  ID
and it has no other knowledge of this device ID, it can
assume that the block was sent in error.</p><p>SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 19999
7. 4.2  Duplicate Block Detection  —   A  duplicate  block
is  a  block  which  is  exactly  the  same  as  the  previous
block  received  by  the  Block  Transfer  Protocol.  This
may occur when the receiver has sent an ACK but, for
some  reason,  the  ACK  did  not  arrive  in  time  at  the
sender,  causing  a  send  retry.  A  duplicate  block  is
detected by the SECS-I message protocol by comparing
the full 10-byte header of a block currently received by
the  block  transfer  protocol  with  the  header  of  the  last
block   accepted   as   non-duplicate   by   the   message
protocol. If the headers are identical, the new block is a
duplicate  and  should  be  discarded.  If  the  headers  are
different, the new block is a non-duplicate. The header
of  the  non-duplicate  block  saved  for  comparison  with
the next block passed on by the block transfer protocol,
and the block containing the header is further processed
by the message receive algorithm.
NOTE: Some implementations which follow the 1980 version
of  SECS-I  may  not  provide  the  unique  headers  required  for
duplicate   block   detection.   An   option   for   disabling   the
duplicate  block  detection  is  required  to  be  compatible  with
these systems.
7. 4.3   Inter-Block  Timeout  T4  —  The   time  interval
between   the   successful   receipt   of   a   block   in   a
multiblock  message,  and  the  successful  receipt  of  the
subsequent  block  of  the  same  message,  is  limited  to
time   T4.   If   this   time   is   exceeded,   the   message   is
cancelled  and  the  transaction  is  aborted.  A  time  called
the   inter-block   timer   is   used   to   measure   the   time
between  block  arrivals  in  the  message  protocol.  There
must be one inter-block timer for each open multi-block
message  currently  being  received  by  the  protocol.  As
each  successive  block  of  a  message  is  received,  the
corresponding inter-block timer is reset.
7. 4.4    Algorithm   —   When   a   block   ar rives   at   the
message protocol, a combination of all the bytes in the
header  is  used  to  determine  what  to  do  with  the  block.
The operation of the message receive algorithm is to be
understood by following the logic flow in Figure 4. The
flow chart shown in Figure 4 and the description of the
algorithm  below  are  not  meant  to  imply  that  particular
implementation    is    required    under    this    standard.
However,       any       SECS-I       message       protocol
implementation  must  include  all  the  logic  shown  in
Figure 4 on page 11.
7. 4.4.1   The  description  of  the  message   protocol  uses
the  concepts  of  an  expected  block.  When  a  (properly
routed  and  non-duplicate)  block  is  received  by  the
message protocol, the first determination is whether the
block  is  one  of  the  expected  blocks  or  not.  In  order  to
determine  if  a  block  is  one  of  the  expected  blocks,  the
header   information   is   compared   with   the   header
information in a list of expected blocks.
7. 4.4.2   If  the  block  is  not  one  of  the  ex pected  blocks,
it   must   be   the   first   block   of   a   primary   message,
otherwise  the  block  has  been  sent  in  error  and  can  be
discarded.  If  the  block  is  the  first  block  of  a  primary
message, and it is not the last block of the message (E-
bit  =  0),  an  inter-block  timer  for  the  given  message  is
established  and  set,  and  the  expected  block  for  the
given message is set to have the same R-bit, device ID,
system  bytes,  W-bit,  message  ID,  and  a  block  number
one greater than that of the block just received.
7. 4.4.3  If the block is one of the expec ted blocks, then
it is either the first block of a reply message or it is part
of an open message.
7. 4.4.4   If  the  block  is  the  first  block  o f  a  reply
message,  the  reply  timer  for  the  given  message  is
cancelled.  For  the  first  block  of  a  reply  message,  the
expected block will have block number one (or possibly
zero if the reply is a single block message) and will be a
secondary   message,   but   the   full   message   ID   is
undetermined. (See Section 7.3.1.)
7. 4.4.5   If  the  block  is  the  last  block  of   the  given
message  (E-bit  =  1),  the  message  is  complete.  If  the
message  is  a  primary  message  for  which  a  reply  is
requested  (W-bit  =  1),  the  system  bytes  are  saved  for
sending with the reply message. (See Section 7.2.3.)
7. 4.4.6  If the block is not the last bloc k of the message
(E-bit  =  0),  then  the  inter-block  timer  for  the  given
message  is  reset,  and  the  (next)  expected  block  for  the
given message is set to have the same R-bit, device ID,
system  bytes,  W-bit,  message  ID,  and  a  block  number
one greater than that of the block just received.
8  Parameter Setting
8. 1  The eight protocol parameters  are listed in Table 4.
The  selection  of  baud  rate  should  be  based  on  system
performance. The value of the device ID is determined
by  the  particular  system  requirements  and  is  generally
unique  within  one  factory.  The  values  of  the  next  five
parameters    are    determined    by    the    performance
characteristics  of  the  host  system  and  the  baud  rate  of
the communication channel. The first seven parameters
must be adjustable by the user. All parameters must be
stored in such a manner that the settings will be retained
if  the  power  fails  or  if  the  system  software  is  reloaded.
The  range  and  resolution  of  protocol  parameters  must
be  at  least  as  shown  in  Table  4.  The  M/S  parameter  is
set to master in the equipment and to slave in the host.</p><p>SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 199910

APPENDIX 1
A1-1  Differences from SECS-I 1980
This  appendix  describes  the  major  differences  between
this  version  of  the  standard  and  the  version  originally
adopted in 1980.
A1-1.1    Signal  Connections  —  The  required  voltage
levels  for  pins  18  and  25  on  the  25  pin  &quot;D&quot;  connector
are now optional.
A1-1.2  Data Rate — The 150 baud data rate has been
made optional.
A1-1.3  Timeout Parameters — The T4 timeout, which
limits   the   inter-block   arrival   time   of   multi-block
messages,  has  been  added.  Use  of  the  T3  timeout  has
been clarified.
A1-1.4  Time Before Length Byte — The protocol time
with  limit  T2  is  now  used  while  waiting  for  the  length
byte after sending an EOT.
A1-1.5    Block Send Acknowledgment — Any character
other  than  an  ACK  received  after  sending  the  second
checksum byte is treated as an NAK.
A1-1.6    Illegal  Block  Lengths  and  Bad  Checksums —
An NAK code is sent for an illegal block length or for a
bad  checksum,  but  only  after  waiting  for  the  sender  to
stop sending by forcing an inter-character (T1) timeout.
A1-1.7    Block  Number  —  The  wording  describing  the
block  number  has  been  clarified  to  say  that  the  value,
zero, is allowed only for single block messages.
A1-1.8    System  Bytes  —  The  handling  of  the  system
bytes for secondary messages sent by a host is now the
same  as  for  the  equipment.  Also,  specific  functional
requirements  have  been  added  for  the  content  of  the
system bytes field.
A1-1.9    Duplicate  Blocks  —  A  mechanism  for  the
detection of duplicate blocks has been added.
A1-1.10    Messages  —  The  discussion  of  message
assembly from blocks has been clarified and expanded.
A1-1.11  Transactions — The discussion of transaction
handling and reply linking has been moved from SECS-
II and expanded.
A1-1.12  Appendix — Parts of the Appendix have been
moved  to  a  new  section  called  Related  Information  to
distinguish  the  content  from  the  standard  itself.  The
general  node  transaction  flow  chart  has  been  moved
from    the    Appendix    in    SECS-II    to    the    Related
Information in SECS-I.
A1-1.13      Titles   —   The   title   of   SECS-I   has   been
changed from &quot;Data Link&quot; to &quot;Message Transfer.&quot; This
phrase   more   accurately   covers   the   content   of   the
standard  and  avoids  confusion  with  other  uses  of  the
term &quot;data link.&quot; The title of the &quot;Data Link&quot; section of
SECS-I  has  been  changed  to  &quot;Block  Transfer.&quot;  The
&quot;Data  Link  Control&quot;  portion  of  the  Block  Transfer
Protocol has been retitled &quot;Line Control.&quot;
A1-1.14  W-Bit — The W-bit is now required to be set
consistently in all blocks.
A1-1.15    Documentation  —  A  section  has  been  added
on the documentation required for compliance with the
standard.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-tags-row row margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/tags/semi">SEMI</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/tags/standard">Standard</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/your-org/semiconductor-docs/tree/main/docs/standards/semi/semi-chapter-021.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>编辑此页</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="文件选项卡"></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">文档</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/ic-design/intro">芯片设计</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/process/intro">工艺制造</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/eda-tools/intro">EDA工具</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/docs/standards/intro">协议标准</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">社区</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/your-org/semiconductor-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/blog">技术博客</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">更多</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/semiconductor-docs/blog">更新日志</a></li><li class="footer__item">
