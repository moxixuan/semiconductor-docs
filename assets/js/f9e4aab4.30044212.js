The rules for describing the state of an object are: (1)use the comma (,) to deliminate concurrent states, (2) use the foreslash (/) to delimit a super-state and sub-state,(3) to deliver the set of lowest level concurrent states, and (4) optionally omit super-state names when there are noambiguities in the names of the lowest level states.9.9.1 Please refer to Figure 3 in order to follow the discussions for the notations. In Harel notation, pump andvacuum are concurrent states. The text to specify this relation in a response to a request for state is pump,vacuum. The comma can be read as meaning and. on and off are sub-states of pump. vent, rough, andHi-V are sub-states of vacuum. The sub-state syntax is state/sub-state where the / can be read as is in sub-state. So using the example in Figure 3, if the pump is off and the vacuum is vented, then the text message whichconveys this is pump/off, vacuum/vent. This message can be shortened to off,vent because there is no ambiguityin doing so. Figure 3State Chart Example 4 Harel D.

The functions are defined in the form of transaction message pairsaccording to the transaction level requirements specified in Section 8.10.2 The functions are described in a standard form which involves specification of the number, name, single ormultiple block, direction of communication, nature of reply required, description, variable definition, and thedetailed structure of the message in terms of lists and items. Double lines separate streams, and single lines separatetransactions to aid readability.10.2.1 The abbreviations used in each transaction are as follows: DescriptionA description of the action generated by the function.StructureDetailed structure showing lists and defined items. Lists are denoted by a capital Lfollowed by the length separated by a comma. The individual elements in the list arenumbered on separate lines. Nested lists are indented to emphasize the structure.The detailed form of the items is given in the define section at the beginning of thetransaction. The symbols "',"<",'" and "',">",'" are used to enclose each item in the structuredata and imply that there is an item header. A detailed description of each data itemas well as a list of the allowable data formats can be found in the Data ItemDictionary.ExceptionSpecial cases in the structure that have a different meaning. Sn,Fm+1 Name of function (same structure as above(secondary) except never with reply)10.3 Message Usage  This section discusses message features and where they may be used.10.3.1 Zero Length Items and Lists  Certain message definitions may use zero length data items and zero lengthlists as a technique to convey specific information to the receiver of the message. For commands (i.e., DoSomething) and requests (i.e., Return Some Data), it may be used to mean Use default values for the dataitem(s) which were not included. The default may be a specific value or a value chosen by the equipment.10.3.1.1 For messages reporting data (either responses to requests or asynchronous reports), the technique may beused to indicate that the desired information is not available or not applicable. In some cases, the fact that data isunavailable may indicate success or failure of a command.10.3.1.2 Certain message definitions may define a zero length data item or a zero length list to mean theinformation is not supplied. The receiving party should react to this lack of information as it deems appropriate.10.3.2 Compliance to Message Definitions  Any given standard SECS-II message shall comply to the formatshown in the Message Definition for that Stream and Function.

The message shall not contain any List Item or Data Item with zero length unless the Message Definitionspecifically defines a meaning for such a zero length item.10.4 Stream 0 and Function 0  Stream 0 is always defined as not used since a 0 is the most likely error. Nofunctions are defined in stream 0.10.4.1 Function 0 exists in all streams and has the same special meaning in each stream. A function 0 messagecloses a transaction, so that the originator will not have to wait for a transaction timeout to proceed.

It is not a requirement that the interpreter send function 0 to close atransaction.10.5 Stream 1 Equipment Status  This stream provides a means for exchanging information about the status of theequipment, including its current mode, depletion of various consumable items, and the status of transfer operations.
