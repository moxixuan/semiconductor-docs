Determination  of  the  suitability  of\nthe material is solely the responsibility of the user.\nR1-1  Basis for this Industry-Specific\nSemiconductor Standard\nR1-1.1        The    Information    Technology    Industry\nCouncil  (ITIC)  \u201cCBEMA-curve,\u201d  contained  in  IEEE\n446,  IEEE  1100,  and  SEMI  E51,  was  used  as  a\nstarting   point   in   establishing   recommended   ride-\nthrough limits.  The following curve (see Figure R1-\n1)  was  developed  to  define  voltage  sag  ride-through\nfor  use  with  semiconductor  processing  equipment.\nPrimarily  due  to  testing  limitations,  only  the  portion\nbetween   0.05   seconds   (50   milliseconds)   and   1.0\nseconds     was     selected     for     inclusion     in     the\nspecification.  As future test equipment, methods, and\ndata  are  developed  the  specified  duration  limits  may\nbe   expanded.      Recommended   voltage   sag   ride-\nthrough  capability  limits  from  zero  to  100  seconds\nare  included  here  for  reference  (see  Figure  R1-1).\nWhile    not    currently    included    in    this    SEMI\nspecification  the  wider  range  should  be  considered\nwhen      designing      equipment      and      selecting\ncomponents.\nR1-1.2    Over  voltage  conditions  also  covered  in  the\nITIC  CBEMA-curve  contained  in  IEEE  446,  IEEE\n1100, and SEMI E51, are not considered in the scope\nof this industry-specific specification primarily due to\nthe    extremely    low    number    of    semiconductor\nequipment   interruptions   caused   by   over   voltage\nevents.    While  not  in  the  scope  of  this  specification,\nover  voltage  conditions  should  not  be  ignored  and\nuse   of   existing   equipment   protection   techniques\nshould be continued (see SEMI E51 or IEEE 446 for\ngeneric     equipment     over     voltage     ride-through\nspecifications).\nR1-2  Relationship to Generic Electrical\nStandards\nR1-2.1      This   SEMI   standard   is   intended   to   be\ncoordinated   with   related   SEMI,   IEC   and   IEEE\nstandards.        The    relationship    of    this    SEMI\nspecification  to  many  other  standards  that  address\nequipment  immunity,  test  methods,  and  safety  was\nconsidered  in  development  of  this  specification.    For\nexample,  the  emerging  IEC  Generic  Immunity  standard\nfor    industrial    environments    currently    published    by\nCENELEC   as   EN   50082-2   recommends   a   generic\nequipment  immunity  limit  for  Europe.    When  published\nby  IEC,  this  standard  will  provide  a  generic  equipment\nvoltage  sag  immunity  limit.    Another  example  is  the  US\nNational    Fire    Protection    Association    on    Industrial\nMachinery  (NFPA  79),  which  sets  a  generic  equipment\nvoltage sag immunity limit for the United States.\nR1-2.2  These emerging generic limits were considered in\nthe establishment of ride-through limits for semiconductor\nequipment.    However,  most  generic  equipment  limits  are\nless  stringent  than  the  existing  CBEMA-curve  currently\nreferenced  in  SEMI  E51.    For  most  installations  meeting\nthe  CBEMA  limits  (a  specification  which  was  developed\nfor   computer   business   equipment)   still   results   in   an\nunacceptable    number    of    semiconductor    equipment\ninterrupts.        Therefore,    the    requirements    in    this\ninternational  standard  were  developed  to  better  suit  the\nsemiconductor   industry.      While   more   stringent,   this\nindustry-specific   specification   is   not   in   conflict   with\nknown  generic  equipment  regulations  from  other  regions\nor generic equipment standards from other organizations.\nR1-2.3  Another published IEC standard defines a generic\nimmunity test method for voltage sags (dips), IEC 61000-\n4-11.    This  standard  does  not  provide  limits  but  does\nprovide   a   voltage   sag   test   method   for   single-phase\nequipment   rated   less   than   16   amps.      It   has   been\nconsidered     in     defining     voltage     sag     ride-through\nparameters  and  it  may  provide  an  interim  voltage  sag\nimmunity  test  method.    As  noted  in  this  document,  a  test\nmethod for three-phase equipment greater than 16 amps is\nbeing developed for use with semiconductor equipment.\nR1-2.4      The   generic   type   standards   developed   for\nindustrial  or  consumer  equipment  by  organizations  like\nIEC,  ITIC,  and  IEEE  provide  a  foundation  for  industry-\nspecific    standards    like    those    published    by    SEMI\nStandards.  In acknowledgement of this tiered approach to\nstandardization   there   are   provisions   for   recognizing\nindustry-specific      or      product-type      standards      by\norganizations like IEC.  Typically, product-type standards\nwhen  developed  by  industry-specific  organizations  take\nprecedent   over   the   broader   based   generic   industrial\nstandards."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F47-0200 \xa9 SEMI 1999, 20006\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n0. 010.1110100\nDuration of Voltage Sag in Seconds\nPercent of Equipment Nominal Voltage\nArea included in Specification\n0. 05 to 1 second\n0. 02\nFigure R1-1\nRecommended Semiconductor Equipment Voltage Sag Ride-Through Capability Curve\nfrom 0 to 100 Seconds\nNOTICE:      SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or\nrepresentations  as  to  the  suitability  of  the  standards  set\nforth    herein    for    any    particular    application.

If   the\ncrucible becomes excessively hot for longer than about\none  minute  during  flaming,  it  may  have  overheated.\nWhen  testing  the  method  for  recovery  rates,  it  will\nbecome  apparent  that  the  sample  has  been  overheated\nfrom the low recovery of metals.\n10. 2.2   One  method  of  cleaning  the  cr ucibles  and\ncovers  is  to  flame  them  with  a  propane  torch  or  other\nappropriate  heating  source  until  they  are  sufficiently\nhot,  allow  them  to  cool,  rinse  in  dilute  ultrapure  nitric\nacid, and then rinse in ultrapure water.\n10. 2.3  When ashing a sample, take ca re that all of the\nash residue remains in the crucible.\n10. 2.4  Several factors concerning sele ction of crucible\nmaterials  should  be  considered  when  performing  the\nDDA  technique.    For  example,  the  crucible  itself  can\ncontribute  elevated  levels  of  its  own  composition  into\nsamples  at  trace  levels.    Temperature  restrictions  are\nanother   factor   to   consider   in   the   selection   of   the\ncrucible  material.    Corrosion  of  the  crucible  during  the\ndecomposition of the sample should also be considered.\nFor  example,  in  the  ashing  of  fluorinated  materials,\nplatinum  is  preferred  over  quartz  glass  that  could  be\netched by the liberated hydrogen fluoride.\n10. 3  Technical  Precautions  \u2013  Diges tion  in  Closed\nVessel (DCV)\n10. 3.1   Trace  analysis  requires  a  thoro ugh  cleaning.\nOne method of cleaning the vessels is to leach with hot\n(1:1) hydrochloric acid (greater than 80 C, but less than\nboiling) for a minimum of two hours followed with hot\n(1:1)   nitric   acid   (greater   than   80   C,   but   less   than\nboiling)  for  a  minimum  of  two  hours  and  rinsed  with\nreagent water and dried in a clean environment.\n10. 4  Other Technical Precautions\n10. 4.1   When  switching  between  high   concentration\nsamples and low concentration samples, all crucibles or\ndigestion  vessels  should  be  cleaned  according  to  the\ncorresponding  and  recommended  cleaning  procedure.\nThis  cleaning  procedure  should  also  be  used  whenever\nthe  prior  use  of  the  digestion  vessels  is  unknown  or\ncross contamination from vessels is suspected.\n10. 4.2  Trace metallic levels of reagen t blanks must be\nsignificantly lower than those in the sample in order to\nobtain accurate results for the analyte of interest.\n10. 4.3     Perform    sample    preparation    in     a    clean\nenvironment   and   under   a   fume   hood   to   minimize\ncontamination."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F48-0600 \xa9 SEMI 20005\n11  Sampling\n11. 1  Sampling of Test Specimens\n11. 1.1   Test  specimens  shall  be  repres entative  of  the\npolymer  material  being  tested  and  shall  be  free  of\nembedded      particles      and      extraneous      surface\ncontamination when visually inspected.\n11. 1.2  Two samples of each material  shall be prepared\nper  SEMI  F40.

For  at  least  two  additional  samples,  add  the\nrecovery spike as discussed in Section 12.\n11. 3.3  Add the reagents needed for th e digestion.\n11. 3.4   Prepare  at  least  three  procedur al  blanks  by\nadding the same amount of all reagents, but no sample,\nto three or more additional containers.  The results from\nthese  blanks  will  be  used  to  determine  the  metallic\ncontribution  from  the  containers  themselves,  from  the\nreagents and from the test procedure.  These procedural\nblanks   should   be   treated   like   any   other   sample.\nContainers  should  be  rotated  in  and  out  of  service  so\nthat the same containers are not always used for blanks.\n11. 3.5  The analyst should be aware o f the potential for\na vigorous reaction.  If a vigorous reaction occurs upon\nthe initial addition of reagent or the sample is suspected\nof  containing  easily  oxidizable  materials,  allow  the\nsample  to  predigest  in  the  uncapped  digestion  vessel.\nHeat may be added in this step for safety considerations\n(for  example  the  rapid  release  of  carbon  dioxide  from\neasily  oxidized  polymeric  material).    Once  the  initial\nreaction  has  ceased,  the  sample  may  continue  through\nthe digestion procedure.\n11. 3.6  Seal the vessel according to th e manufacturer\u2019s\ndirections.\n11. 3.7    Properly   place   the   vessel   in   the    digestion\nsystem  according  to  the  manufacturer\u2019s  recommended\nspecifications  and  connect  appropriate  temperature  and\npressure sensors to vessels according to manufacturer\u2019s\nspecifications."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F48-0600 \xa9 SEMI 20006\n11. 3.8   Set  the  parameters  of  the  diges tion  device  to\nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\nNOTE  10:  If  the  pressure  exceeds  the  pressure  limits  of  the\nvessel,  the  pressure  will  be  reduced  by  the  relief  mechanism\nof the vessel.\nNOTE 11: Pressure control for a specific matrix is applicable\nif  instrument  conditions  are  established  using  temperature\ncontrol.    Because  each  matrix  will  have  a  different  reaction\nprofile,   performance   using   temperature   control   must   be\ndeveloped  for  every  specific  matrix  type  prior  to  use  of  the\npressure control system.\n11. 3.9   At  the  end  of  the  digestion  pro gram,  allow  the\nvessels to cool for an appropriate period of time before\nremoving  them  from  the  system.    When  the  vessels\nhave cooled to near room temperature, determine if the\nmicrowave  vessels  have  maintained  a  seal  throughout\nthe  digestion.    Due  to  the  wide  variability  of  vessel\ndesigns, a single procedure is not appropriate.  The use\nof  a  spiked  control  sample  is  appropriate  to  ensure  that\nanalyte loss has not occurred due to vessel venting.  For\nvessels  with  burst  disks,  a  careful  visual  inspection  of\nthe disk may identify compromised sample digestions.\n11. 3.10   Complete  the  preparation  of  th e  sample  by\ncarefully  uncapping  and  venting  each  vessel  in  a  fume\nhood.        Vent    the    vessels    using    the    procedure\nrecommended by the vessel manufacturer.  Transfer the\nsample to an appropriate acid cleaned container.\n11. 3.11   If  the  digested  sample  contains   particulates,\nwhich may clog nebulizers or interfere with injection of\nthe  sample  into  the  instrument,  the  sample  may  be\ncentrifuged, allowed to settle, or filtered.\n11. 3.11.1   If  necessary,  centrifugation  at   2,000\u20133,000\nrpm  for  10  minutes  is  usually  sufficient  to  clear  the\nsupernatant.\n11. 3.11.2  Settling  \u2013\u2013  If  undissolved  mate rial  remains\nsuch  as  TiO,  or  other  refractory  oxides,  allow  the\nsample to stand until the supernatant is clear.  Allowing\na  sample  to  stand  overnight  will  usually  accomplish\nthis.\n11. 3.11.3  Filtering   \u2013\u2013   If   necessary,   the   f iltering\napparatus  must  be  thoroughly  cleaned  and  pre-rinsed\nwith dilute (approximately 10% V/V) nitric acid.  Filter\nthe sample through qualitative filter paper into a second\nacid-cleaned container.\n11. 3.12  Continue preparing the sample  as described in\nSection 11.4.\n11. 4  Preparation of the Sample for  Analysis\n11. 4.1   If  the  sample  was  obtained  fro m  the  DDA\nmethod,  add  0.5  mL  concentrated  nitric  acid  to  each\ncrucible.\n11. 4.2   For  samples  obtained  from  the   DCV  method,\ntransfer or decant the sample into volumetric ware.\n11. 4.3   Dilute  either  obtained  sample   to  a  required\nvolume    with    ultrapure    water    (usually    20    mL).\nAlternatively,  a  gravimetric  dilution  of  the  samples  is\nalso  appropriate.    The  samples  are  now  ready  for\nanalysis.      See   Related   Documents,   Section   16   for\napplicable trace inorganics test methods.\n12  Recovery Preparation and   Percentage\nRecovery Rate Determination\n12. 1   Metal  recovery  percentage  mu st  be  determined\nfor all instruments by the individual laboratory.  This is\naccomplished via spiking a crucible or digestion vessel\ncontaining     a     polymer     sample     with     a     known\nconcentration   of   metals.      Then,   determining   the\npercentage    of    each    metal    recovered    after    the\ndecomposition process or acid digestion.  The following\nprovides the recommended method for spiking:\n12. 1.1  Add a known volume of a stan dard to a crucible\nor digestion container containing a polymer sample.\n12. 1.2  For  DDA  \u2013\u2013  Gently  evaporate   the  standard\nsolution to dryness.\n12. 1.3   Digest  the  dried  standard  and  d ried  polymer\nusing  the  same  procedure  as  for  the  samples.    Typical\nrecovery  rates  are  70\u2013110%  for  the  alkali,  alkaline\nearths, and most transition metals.\n13  Data Analysis\n13. 1  Calculations\n13. 1.1    The   concentration   of   trace   met als   in   the\nsolution    must    be    calculated    to    determine    the\nconcentration  in  \u03bcg/g  (ppm)  of  the  polymeric  material\nusing the following equation:\npolymer concentration (\u03bcg/g ) =\n= solution concentration\n(\u03bcg/L) \xd7 solution volume (L) / mass of the polymer(g)\n13. 1.2   Since  the  procedural  blank  doe s  not  contain  a\nweighed  sample,  the  results  must  be  transformed  to\nsolid  concentrations  (in  \u03bcg/g)  by  using  the  average\nweight   of   the   samples   (see   Section   11.1.2   and\ncorresponding NOTE).\n14  Data Presentation\nNOTE 12: Use the Report Form provided in Section 17 of this\ndocument.\n14. 1  Sample Information\n14. 1.1  Provide the date(s) of the test,  the person and/or\ncompany  requesting  the  analysis,  the  method  in  which\nthe sample was obtained (e.g., if it was separated from a"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI F48-0600 \xa9 SEMI 20007\nlarger   component   and   delivered   to   the   laboratory),\noperator  and  laboratory  performing  the  test,  type  of\nmaterial  (e.g.,  PFA  pellets,  injection  molded  PVDF\nvalve,  perfluoroelastomer  O-ring),  material  supplier,\nmaterial  model  and  lot  number(s),  date  sample  was\nobtained and if the sample is a prototype or production\nmaterial.\n14. 2  Methods\n14. 2.1   Provide  the  method  of  cleanin g  the  sample  as\nwell  as  indicating  if  the  sample  arrived  pre-cleaned\nfrom the requester or if it was cleaned in the laboratory\nperforming the test.\n14. 2.2    Check   the   applicable   box   for   t he   type   of\ndigestion.

The system\nshould  recognize  electrical  power  that  does  not  meet\nspecification and provide proper power conditioning so\nas not to impact wafer processing.\n7. 1.2   Power  monitoring  is  used  to  m easure  electrical\nsystem  power  quality  performance  for  the  following\nreasons.\na) Monitoring     data     can     be     compared     to\nequipment    voltage    sag    specifications    to\nidentify problems.\nb) Selection  and  control  of  power  conditioning\ndevices    are    dependent    upon    monitoring\nmeasurements.\n7. 1.3  Power conditioning is implem ented to correct for\ngaps  in  equipment  voltage  sag  susceptibility  and  point\nof  connection  electrical  power  performance.    Power\nconditioning  is  occasionally  implemented  where  the\nrisk  of  unacceptable  equipment  performance  is  high,\nwhere   equipment   performance   tolerance   is   outside\nspecifications,   and   where   equipment   interruption   is\ncostly.\n7. 2  Monitoring and Conditioning  Program\n7. 2.1     Quantify    the    process    equipmen t,    support\nequipment,    and    facilities    infrastructure    equipment\nvoltage   sag   susceptibility   using   industry   standard\nspecifications  and  test  methods.

Select    and    implement    identified    power\nconditioning   solutions   into   the   facilities   electrical\ndistribution system.  (See Section 7.7.)\n7. 2.5    Maintain   the   installed   power   c onditioning\nequipment  and  monitor  the  power  either  continuously\nor   periodically   to   assure   performance   and   evaluate\nresults.\n7. 3  Process Equipment Performan ce\n7. 3.1    Facility   design   specifications   s hould   include\nrequirements   for   processing   equipment   voltage   sag\nimmunity (see industry specification for semiconductor\nprocessing   equipment   voltage   sag   immunity).   (See\nRelated Documents section.)\n7. 3.2   Variability  in  process  equipme nt  manufacturing\nand supplied utility power quality preclude interruption\nfree   manufacturing.      This   variation   comes   from\nmultiple sources:\na) Verification    of    representative    samples    of\nequipment  does  not  guarantee  100%  of  the\nequipment will meet the same requirements.\nb) Factors    such    as    location,    load    changes,\ncapacity,       weather,       and       transmission/\ndistribution  equipment,  limit  how  well  utility\npower quality can be controlled.\nc) The  tests,  themselves,  are  not  variation  free;\nthe  test  equipment,  calibration  processes,  and\nthe    test    personnel    can    introduce    further\nvariability.\n7. 3.3   The  risk  of  manufacturing  inte rruptions  can  be\nconsiderably reduced through two approaches.\na) Create a margin between allowable voltage sag\nfor   the   supplied   utility   power   and   process\nequipment voltage sag immunity.\nb) Provide  added  protection  from  interruptions\ndue  to  voltage  sag  events  by  enhancing  the\npower   quality   in   the   facilities   distribution\nsystem.

Monitor    current    to    identify\ndisturbance sources and assist in solutions.\n7. 5.2   Locate  continuous  monitoring   at  the  electrical\nutility  service,  all  major  facility  electrical  distribution\ncenters,  and  all  critical  equipment  electrical  points  of\nconnection.    Perform  periodic  monitoring  for  at  least\none   location   of   each   equipment   type   in   order   to\ncharacterize  the  electrical  environment  under  normal\nconditions   (i.e.,   to   create   a   baseline).      Additional\nmonitoring  should  be  performed  when  experiencing\nunexplained  operational  problems.    A  comparison  of\nbaseline    data    to    monitored    data    for    equipment\nexperiencing  problems  is  recommended  for  evaluating\nthe power supplied to the equipment.\n7. 5.3    Provide   time   synchronization   f or   multiple\nmonitors to allow for the correlation of a single voltage\nsag event between all monitors.\n7. 5.4   In  order  to  understand  the  imp act,  correlate\nmonitored   voltage   sag   events   with   known   wafer\nprocessing effects within the process equipment.\n7. 6  Measuring and Modeling Stra tegies\n7. 6.1   A  single  voltage  sag  event  orig inating  outside\nthe  factory  will  vary  in  magnitude  and  duration  when\nmeasured  at  differing  locations  throughout  the  facility.\nThis  is  largely  due  to  differing  lengths  and  type  of\ndistribution   conductors   feeding   equipment   located\nthroughout   the   facility.      In   addition,   the   electrical\ninteractions  of  the  reactive  and  non-linear  elements  of\nequipment effect the voltage sag measurements.\n7. 6.2   Voltage  sag  events  that  origina te  within  the\nfacility   electrical   distribution   system   will   vary   in\nmagnitude  and  duration  when  measured  at  differing\nlocations  throughout  the  facility.    These  voltage  sag\nevents are usually a result of a current flow increase and\nthe   associated   voltage   drop   across   the   conductors\nbetween  the  source  and  load.

The variance in\nvoltage  sag  characteristics  can  create  different  effects\non   similar   equipment.      Variances   can   usually   be\nexplained by examining 1) the characteristics of voltage\nsag  at  the  utility  interfaces,  2)  the  type  and  connection\nconfiguration  of  voltage  transformations,  and  3)  the\nvoltage levels and corresponding phase relationships at\nthe  terminals  of  infrastructure,  support,  and  process\nequipment within the facility.\n7. 6.5.2   The  types  of  faults  that  can  oc cur  on  a  utility\nsystem are:\n\u2022 Line to line to line,\n\u2022 Line to line to line to ground,\n\u2022 Line to line,\n\u2022 Line to line to ground, and\n\u2022 Line to ground.\n7. 6.5.3   The  utility  network  can  be  mo deled  to  predict\nthe  voltage  sag  characteristics  due  to  various  types  of\nfaults     at     the     electrical     interfaces     between     a\nsemiconductor  manufacturing  facility  and  utility.    The\nmost common utility system fault type is a single line to\nground  fault.

If\nthe plant is to be operated with no annual shutdowns for\nmaintenance,  then  the  system  should  be  designed  with\nenough redundancy to maintain every component in the\nplant   without   dropping   service   to   any   load.      This\nrequires at least a dual feed system that originates with\ntwo  or  more  utility  sources  and  continues  throughout\nthe   semiconductor   factory   with   appropriate   transfer\nschemes to keep the loads energized at all times and to\ntransfer loads without interruptions.\n6. 4.3.4.2   The  most  reliable  service  is  on e  where  there\nare  multiple  sources  connected  in  a  network  to  the\nsemiconductor factory.

If a network is\nnot  available,  a  dual  feed  system  can  be  configured  to\nprovide  an  immediate  transfer  to  the  backup  system  in\nthe case of primary source failure, reducing outage time\nto  near  zero.    Additionally,  if  the  two  sources  are\nindependent,   a   static   transfer   switch   may   increase\nquality to a level higher than that of a network.  If only\none source is available to a semiconductor factory with\na  load  of  less  than  five  megawatts,  an  alternative  is  on\nsite   generation   combined   with   a   voltage   sag   ride-\nthrough system.\n6. 4.3.5  Minimize exposure.\n6. 4.3.5.1   When  choosing  source  configu rations,  it  is\nimportant  to  consider  exposure  at  the  semiconductor\nfactory   site.

The  most  common  sealing  requirements  in\nDI  water  systems  are  filters,  valves,  flow  and  pressure\nregulators, and fittings.\n7. 2  Contaminants in DI water fall  primarily into three\ncategories.    They  are  ion  contamination,  T.O.C.\u2019s  and\nbacterial   growth.      Contaminant   levels   are   usually\nmeasured in parts per billion (PPB).\n7. 3  Ion contamination problems ar e caused by anionic\nand  cationic  elements  in  DI  water  such  as  fluorides,\nchlorides,  sulfates,  etc.    These  can  be  leached  from\nseals as well as the DI plumbing.\n7. 4   Cations  (mostly  metallic  ions)   are  leached  from\nseals as well as the plumbing that delivers the DI water.\nIn  order  to  kill  bacteria  which  have  a  propensity  to\ngrow  in  DI  water,  the  water  is  either  heated  (80\xb0C+),\nozonated,  or  bombarded  with  UV  light,  or  possibly  a\ncombination of these three elements.  This poses unique\nproblems for seals used in the DI system and can cause\nthe following problems: Contamination of the DI water\ncaused  by  T.O.C.\u2019s  being  leached  from  the  seals  and\nplumbing.\n7. 5   Seal  breakdown  caused  by  ozo ne  attack,  or  seal\ndeterioration due to UV exposure.  T.O.C.\u2019s are of great\nconcern  since  they  can  adhere  to  wafers  and  result  in\ndegraded oxide quality and hazy films.  Ozone and UV\ndeterioration  of  the  seals  usually  leads  to  particulate\ncontamination.    These  can  be  as  small  as  single  atoms\nor molecules to gross particle size contamination.\n7. 6  Considerations:\n\u2022 What   method   of   sterilization   (i.e.,   chemical,\nthermal or radiation)?\n\u2022 Concerns for cations, anions, or T.O.C.\u2019s?\n\u2022 Seal life expectation?\n8  Considerations for Use in   Corrosives\n(Acids, Bases), Oxidizers, and Solvents\nNOTE 3: See Figure 2.\n8. 1   Inorganic  wet  chemicals  at  hig h  concentration\nlevels  and  in  some  cases  at  elevated  temperatures  are\nreadily  used  in  front-end  semiconductor  processing  in\nthe   fabrication   of   semiconductor   devices.      Most\ncommon  sealing  requirements  are  in  acid  recirculation\nand   chemical   distribution   systems   (mostly   BCD\u2019s).\nComponent  systems  include  pumps,  filters,  megasonic\nseals, gaskets for pipeline interfaces and valves.\n8. 2   Of  primary  concern  when  spec ifying  a  specific\nseal  for  an  application  are  issues  relating  to  resistance\nto  chemical  reaction.    Design  considerations  should\ninclude  resistance  to  chemical  breakdown,  static  vs.\ndynamic      environments,      pressure,      temperature,\nleachables, particle generation.\n8. 3   Chemical  and  Thermal  Degrad ation  involves  the\nincompatibility  of  the  seals  to  the  process  chemistries.\nAn   example   is   Hydroflouric   Acid   (HF)   dissolves\nsilicone  elastomers.    The  same  is  true  of  temperature\ndegradation  (i.e.,  Piranha  or  Phosphoric  Acids)  where\nthe     process     temperature     causes     thermally     and\nchemically  induced  effects  on  the  seal.    That  also\ncontributes to the mechanical failure of the seal.\n8. 4  Leaching is most commonly a ssociated with metal\nfiller   systems   of   the   seal,   which   usually   introduce\nmetallic  ions.    This  is  a  continuous  occurrence  as  long\nas the seal is in the system.\n8. 4.1    Particles \uf8e7   Particles   can   be   th e   result   of\nmechanical damage of the seal or as a result of leaching\nor  chemical  degradation  or  foreign  material  present  on\nthe seal surface.  Particles can end up on the wafer and\ncause defects.\n8. 4.2     Summary \uf8e7    All    cases    of    the    a bove\ncontamination  can  create  electrical  shorts,  voids,  and\nunwanted doping.\n8. 4.3   Solvents \uf8e7  Incompatibility  of   elastomers  or\nseals      with      solvent      chemistries      may      cause\ncontamination.\n8. 4.3.1      For     example,     there     are     degrees      of\nincompatibility:\n8. 4.3.1.1  If the seal is dissolved by the s olvent, then a\ncatastrophic  failure  occurs  where  the  solvent  leaks  out\nof the liquid process loop.  This is associated with mis-\nprocessed wafers.\n8. 4.3.1.2  Another type of solvent seal in teraction is the\nswelling  of  the  elastomer  or  the  leaching  of  small\namounts   of   elastomer.      Excessive   swelling   of   the\nelastomer  can  result  in  premature  seal  failures  and  a\nhigher cost of ownership caused by increased frequency\nof seal change outs.\n9  Considerations for Use In  Thermal\nProcesses\nNOTE 4: See Figure 3.\n9. 1  Diffusion processes are used p rimarily for growth\nof oxide layers and to anneal crystal damage caused by\nimplant.    Diffusion  furnaces  are  usually  batch  process\nequipment where the process atmosphere is constrained\nwithin  quartz  tubes.
