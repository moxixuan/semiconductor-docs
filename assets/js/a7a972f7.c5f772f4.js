If  the  change  is  allowed,  then  a  change\nrequest record shall be created in non-volatile memory\nfor each allowed change request.\nAny  operation  that  creates  or  changes  a  recipe  body,  a\nrecipe  attribute,  or  a  recipe  identifier,  requires  explicit\nmanager    approval.    This    includes    the    following\noperations:    create,  delete,  modify  (body),  copy  (new\nidentifier), rename (new identifier), protect, verify, link,\nunlink,  certify,  de-certify,  change  read-write  generic\nattribute,     and     change     read-write     agent-specific\nattribute.\nThe following requirements shall apply:\n\xf3 A request to create a new recipe, or copy an existing\nrecipe,  with  a  specified  identifier  shall  be  granted\nonly  if  that  identifier  is  not  in  use  for  a  write-\nprotected  recipe  within  the  namespace  as  a  whole\n(that  is,  no  attached  DRNS  segment  has  a  write-\nprotected recipe using that identifier).\n\xf3 A request from a DRNS segment to rename a recipe\nshall  be  granted  only  if  no  other  segment  has  that\nrecipe and the new identifier is not otherwise in use.\n\xf3  A  request  from  a  dedicated  segment  to  delete  a\nrecipe  shall  be  denied  only  if  the  recipe  is  write-\nprotected.\n10. 3.4.4    Change   Request   Record   Definition   \xf3   A\nchange   request   record,   as   shown   in   Figure   5.7,\nconsists of the following information:\n\xf3 The recipe identifier (RecipeID\n),\n\xf3 a destination  recipe  identifier (DestRecipeID\n) (used\nfor copy and rename only, and otherwise null),\n\xf3  the  segment  specifier,  (Segment\n),  of  the  DRNS\nsegment that has requested a change or to which the\nchange operation is or will be delegated,\n\xf3 the specific type of change requested (ChangeType\n),\n\xf3  a  timestamp  of  when  the  request  was  received\n(Timestamp\n),\n\xf3  an  operation  identifier  (OperationID\n),  an  integer\ndelegated   by   the   DRNS   manager   that   uniquely\nidentifies   a   given   change   request   within   the\ndistributed recipe namespace at large,\n\xf3  a  boolean  (SegmentRequest\n)  used  to  differentiate\nrequests  by  attached  segments  from  other  requests\n(the manager responds differently in the two cases).\nAll of the above information, with the exception of the\nsegment  specifier,  shall  be  determined  at  the  time  the\nchange   request   record   is   created.

It   is\ndetermined either to be allowed or not allowed.\nIf  the  requested  change  is  allowed,  then  a  change\nrequest  record  is  created  for  the  specified  recipe  by\nsaving  the  information  required.  The  change  request  is\nnow INACTIVE and ON HOLD (see Figure 10.1). The\noperations identifier is set to a unique unsigned integer.\nIf the change was initiated externally, a segment may or\nmay  not  be  designated  until  the  change  request  is\nselected  for  approval.  The  remaining  information  is\nfilled at this time. The change request record is placed\nin a queue for that recipe in non-volatile memory.\nThe change  request  remains  on hold  until  the  DRNS\nmanager  selects  it  as  the  next  change  and  it  becomes\nselected. If a segment has not already been designated,\nthen one is determined at this time. The selected recipe\nmay  be  discarded  after  evaluation  due  to  changes  in\ncircumstances   since   it   was   originally   put   on hold.\nOtherwise, the change request becomes active, and the\nchange  request  record  is  added  to  any  attached  DRNS\nrecorder.    The    manager    is    ready    to    begin    its\nnegotiations with the designated segment or to approve\na segment-initiated change  request  already  in  progress,\nat this point.\nThese  stages  may  occur  in  rapid  succession  if  the\nrequest is initiated by a segment and the recipe was not\nlocked.\nSelection  occurs  in  one  of  two  ways:  either  a  change\nrequest   is   received   when   the   specified   recipe   is\nunlocked (Section  10.3.4.5),  or  else  a  currently  active\nchange request completes, and a new change request is\nselected  from  the  queue  of  change  request  records on\nhold  for  that  recipe.  Rules  for  selection  may  vary  and\nare beyond the scope of RMS. For example, rules could\nbe  sequence-oriented  (first-in,  first-out),  or  they  might\nconsider the types of operations specified. For example,\nrequests  for  verification  might  be  given  precedence\nover requests to link.\nWhen  a  selected  change  request  becomes  active,  the\nmanager   adds   the   change   request   record   to   any\nattached recorder  and  begins  negotiations  with  the\ndelegated segment.\nIf  the  change  request  was  segment-initiated  (Section\n10. 3.5),  the  segment  change  request  is  approved.  The\nDRNS   manager   shall   initiate   a   segment   change\napproval to the DRNS segment (Section 10.1.2.2).\nThere  are  three  possible  scenarios  for  the  negotiations\nwith  the  segment:  an  externally  initiated  request,  an\ninternally  initiated  request  from  a  segment  when  the\nrecipe   specified   was   unlocked,   and   an   internally\ninitiated   request   from   a   segment   when   the   recipe\nspecified was locked.

In   this   case,\nRMDComplete  is  not  sent.  However,  if  the  segment\nresponds  before  actually  making  the  change,  then  it  is\nrequired  to  send  the  notification  RMDComplete  when\ndone.\nWhen  a  requested  change  has  been  completed  by  the\ndelegated segment,  it  notifies  its  manager  by  sending\nthe  notification  RMDComplete  as  shown  in  Figures\n10. 1 and 10.2 (b). The type of change and results of the\nchange   operation   dictate   how   the   change   shall   be\nupdated  to  the  other  attached  DRNS  segments  of  the\nnamespace.  After  all  affected  DRNS  segments  have\nbeen  properly  updated,  then  the  change  request  record\ncorresponding   to   the   completed   change   shall   be\nremoved  from  the  queue.  If  there  are  still  inactive\nchange  requests,  the  next  request  is  selected  and  then\nmade active.\nAll  other  DRNS  segments  with  the  same  logical  recipe\nshall  be  updated  as  appropriate.  A  change  in  agent-\nspecific   datasets   only   shall   be   updated   to   master\nsegments.  A  change  to  attributes  only  shall  cause  only\nthe  attributes  of  other  instances  of  that  recipe  to  be\nupdated.  If  the  logical  recipe  was  changed,  then  all\nsegments  having  a  copy  of  that  logical  recipe  shall  be\nupdated.\nWhen  all  necessary  updates  have  been  performed,  the\nDRNS   manager   shall   discard   the   change   request\nrecord.  It  shall  either  request  its  DRNS  recorder  to\nremove the change request for that change or to add the\nnext change  request  to  be  approved.  Then  the  DRNS\nmanager shall select another inactive change request. If\nno  further  change  requests  exist  for  that  recipe,  the\nDRNS  manager  shall  remove  the  last  change  request\nfrom any attached DRNS recorder.\n10. 3.4.7    Change   Management   Example   \xf3   As   an\nexample  of  change  management,  if  an  operator  at\nEquipment  A  wants  to  link  Recipe  R;3  within  the\ndistributed  recipe  namespace  D,  the  resulting  changes\nto  the  recipe's  generic  header  must  be  passed  to  all\nother  attached  DRNS  segments  within  the  namespace\nthat  contain  Recipe  R;3  before  any  other  change  is\napproved.\nIn  this  example,  if  a  request  from  segment  A  to  link\nRecipe R;3 is received by the manager, and no inactive\nrequests  exist,  and  if  Recipe  R;3  is  not  already  both\nlinked  and  write-protected,  and  if  the  request  is  to  be\napproved, the DRNS manager creates a change request\nrecord  for  that  recipe,  which  locks  the  recipe.  The\nDRNS   manager   approves   the   request   and   denies\nsubsequent requests until the approved change has been\nmade and other segments with an instance of that recipe\nhave been updated appropriately.\n10. 3.5    Segment   Change   Request   \xf3   The   segment\nchange  request  operation  is  a  request  made  by  an\nattached DRNS  segment  to  approve  a  specific  type  of\nchange.  The  DRNS  manager  shall  respond  by  either\napproving the request, denying it, or putting it on hold.\nWhen  putting  the  requested  change  on  hold,  the  DRNS\nmanager  shall  return  the  operation  identifier  delegated\nin the corresponding change request record.\nThe segment  change  request  operation  is  invoked  with\nthe service RMDSegChange sent by an attached DRNS\nsegment.\n10. 3.6   Segment  Action  Complete  \xf3  A  DRNS  segment\nthat has requested and received permission to change a\nrecipe  shall  notify  the  DRNS  manager  when  the  action\nis  complete,  whether  normally  or  abnormally.  Also,\nwhen the manager approves an earlier request made by\na segment,  and  the  segment  makes  the  change  after\nresponding  to  the  approval,  the  segment  shall  also\nnotify its manager of the completion of the change. The\nnotification  allows  the  DRNS  manager  to  request  the\nupdated   recipe   and   send   it   to   other   segments   as\nappropriate.\nThe segment action complete operation is invoked with\nthe   service   RMDComplete,   sent   by   an   attached\nsegment.\n10. 3.7  Segment  Notification  \xf3  A  dedicated  segment\nshall  notify  its  manager  of  any  change  to  an  agent-\nspecific dataset.

This  list  may  be  provided  by  either  the\nservice  user  or  by  a  DRNS  recorder  specified  by  the  service  user.

In  general,  both\nequipment   and   host   may   provide   services   to   one\nanother, and some services may be provided by both. In\ncertain  cases,  one  may  provide  services  to  its  partner\nthat   the   other   does   not.   With   respect   to   recipes,\nequipment refers to the recipe\xeds executor, whereas host\nrepresents   a   supervisory   agent   who   may   delegate\nrecipes which will be executed by the equipment.\nFor clusters, cells, and local-area stations, where a mid-\nlevel   controller   communicates   both   to   lower-level\ncomponents  and  to  a  higher  level  factory  system,  that\ncontroller  may  alternately  take  the  role  of  host  to  its\ncomponents and of equipment to the factory system.\nWhere role is significant, the terms equipment and host\nare  used  in  this  section  to  indicate  the  relationship  of\nthe two agents to one another.\nR1-3.1    Traceability  \xf3  A  main  management  objective\nin  both  a  Development  Fab  and  a  Production  Fab  is\ntraceability  of  manufacturing  conditions  to  the  final\ndevice  characteristics.  This  traceability  is  required  in  a\nDevelopment    Fab    to    support    the    analysis    and\ncharacterization   of   the   process   under   development.\nCertain  customers  of  a  Production  Fab  require  this\ntraceability in order to do business. Even without such a\ncustomer   requirement,   traceability   is   important   for\nprocess control and postmortem analysis of unexpected\ndevice characteristics.\nThe     recipe     is     the     primary     specification     of\nmanufacturing  conditions  to  the  equipment;  therefore,\nthe management of recipes is critical to this traceability.\nR1-3.2  Recipe Life Cycle \xf3 The lifetime of a recipe in\na  Fab  typically  has  several  phases,  as  illustrated  in\nFigure  R1-1.  While  being  developed,  it  may  contain\nerrors,  or  it  may  not  produce  the  desired  results.  The\nrecipe  may  be  edited  several  times  during  its  initial\ndevelopment.  At  some  point,  the  recipe  enters  the  test\nphase,   where   it   will   be   executed   and   its   results\nevaluated.  A  check  for  syntax  correctness  occurs  at  or\nbefore the time the equipment prepares it for execution.\nStill  further  changes  may  be  made  to  fine-tune  the\nprocess   to   achieve   a   particular   result.   During   this\nprocess, it is still desirable to be able to protect it from\ninadvertent  change  or  deletion.  Finally,  the  recipe  is\nready  for  production  and  goes  through  a  series  of\nsignoffs   which   constitutes   a   formal   authorization\nprocedure.  In  many  factories,  only  recipes  which  have\nbeen  approved  as  production-worthy  may  be  used  in\nproduction runs."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"Figure R1-1\nTypical Recipe Life Cycle\nAlso,   because   results   may   vary   between   different\ninstallations   of   equipment,   an   additional   level   of\nauthorization  may  be  required  that  certifies  individual\nequipment for a given approved recipe.\nA  factory  change  control  system  must  accommodate\ndifferent  levels  of  protection  for  recipes  in  different\nphases   of   their   life   cycle.   To   accomplish   this,\nequipment  must  recognize  and  support  the  different\nrequirements for each phase.\nR1-3.3    Recipe  Editing  \xf3  Traditionally,  recipes  are\ndeveloped  on  the  equipment  that  runs  them.  Besides\nrequiring  time  on  the  target  machine  (a  potentially\nscarce and expensive resource), this requires the person\ndefining the recipe to be inside a clean area. A potential\nsolution  is  for  equipment  manufacturers  to  provide\nversions  of  their  dedicated  recipe  editors  that  can  be\nintegrated   into   the   factory   manufacturing   systems.\nAside     from     the     difficulty     of     the     equipment\nmanufacturer   supporting   the   variety   of   platforms\ncurrently  in  use  internationally,  even  in  a  distributed\nfactory    environment,    a    proliferation    of    different\ndedicated recipe editors required for the different types\nof equipment is not considered a good solution.\nA  better  solution  is  to  permit  editing  external  to  the\ncleanroom and then to transmit the completed recipe to\nthe equipment for verification. This can be achieved by\nproviding  a  text\nform  of  the  equipment  manufacturer\xeds\nrecipe  language  which  can  be  created  and  modified\nwith any standard text editor. This may not be possible\nwith  some  types  of  recipes  (e.g.,  pattern  recognition"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E42-0704 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2004 118\nprograms  for  vision  systems),  but  this  restriction  may\nbe removed when the technology advances.\nEditing   on   the   equipment   may   still   be   desirable,\nparticularly in a Development Fab. When the equipment\npermits  a  recipe  to  be  changed,  the  equipment  must\nprovide  reporting  mechanisms  that  inform  the  host  of\nchanges  and  allow  the  host\xeds  change  control  system  to\noperate.\nR1-3.4    Recipe  Sharing  \xf3  A  Fab  may  have  several\ninstallation  of  the  same  type  of  equipment  (equipment\nwith   the   same   functionality   and   the   same   recipe\nlanguage).  Therefore,  where  possible,  the  same  recipe\nshould   be   able   to   be   shared   between   different\nequipment of this same type.\nR1-3.5  Protection and Process Control \xf3 The primary\ngoal  of  process  control  is  to  ensure  that  the  final  result\nof  the  manufacturing  process  does  not  change  over\ntime.  This  may  be  accomplished  by  both  feedback  and\nfeedforward   methods.   These   methods   modify   the\nsettings   used   in   the   process.   This   requires   two\ncapabilities that seem to be in conflict:\n\u2022 The  definition  of  the  process  settings  (the  recipe)\nshould not change.\n\u2022 The  process  settings  should  change  to  counter  the\ndrift inherent in real processes.\nThe   first   capability   is   particularly   important   in   a\nProduction  Fab.  Most  Fab  policies  prohibit  processes\nfrom   changing   after   they   have   been   approved   for\nproduction.  This  is  easy  to  build  into  a  change  control\nsystem  on  the  host.  However,  if  the  equipment  allows\nlocal editing, then it must also enforce this policy.\nWholesale  changes  in  a  recipe  are  never  necessary  for\nthe  second  purpose.  Usually  only  a  few  parameter\nvalues   are   modified   in   small   increments   to   effect\ncontrol of the process. A well-defined process specifies\nthe  parameters  that  vary  and  their  range  of  variation.\nFor any given recipe, it must be possible for the host to\nspecify  different  values  of  such  parameters  for  each\npiece  of  equipment  so  that  the  recipe  may  be  \xectuned\xee\nfor   that   equipment   to   produce   uniform   results.   In\naddition, the process control agent, on the equipment or\nthe host, may need the ability to calculate the parameter\nvalue changes for each run and to inform the equipment\nof the new values. Mechanisms are provided to support\nsuch interactions.\nR1-3.6      Recipe   Selection   \xf3   Typical   operation   of\nequipment  requires  an  operator  or  the  host  to  initially\nselect  the  recipe  to  be  run.  Recipe  selection  may  be\nspecified  implicitly  within  the  definition  of  a  higher\norder \xecprocess job\xee. In either case, the specification of a\nrecipe   is   accomplished   by   referring   to   its   recipe\nidentifier (i.e., the identifier used by the change control\nsystem)  and,  where  needed  to  resolve  ambiguity,  its\nlocation.  Once  selected,  a  recipe  is  initiated  by  an\nappropriate  start  command,  which  may  be  explicitly\ngiven by the operator or host or implicitly given by the\nequipment  when  executing  a  higher  order  process  job.\nRepeated runs of the same recipe may be accomplished\nvia subsequent start commands without the necessity of\nformal recipe re-selection."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"R1-4  Example of a Factory Implementation of Approval Levels\nA factory might implement different levels of approval by regulating the following levels of recipe approval on the\nequipment:\nApproval   Level                                    FACTORY                                    POLICY"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"Level 0                                           \u201cUnapproved\u201d\nLevel 1                                           \u201cIn Test\u201d\nLevel 2                                           \u201cNon-Production\u201d\nLevel 3                                           \u201cReady for Release\u201d\nLevel 4                                           \u201cReleased for Production\u201d\nwith\nRecipeReadOnlyLevel\n= 2                           Level 2 = read-only\nR1-5  Examples of Variable Parameters\nThe recipe body may have statements that allow parameters to be changed within fixed limits.
