SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 199913 RELATED INFORMATION NOTICE  The material contained in this RelatedInformation is not an official part of SEMI E4 (SECS-I)and is not intended to modify or supercede the officialstandard. Rather, this information describes possiblemethods for implementing the protocol described by thestandard and are included as reference material. Thestandard should be referred to in all cases. SEMI makesno warranties or representations as to the suitability ofthe material set forth herein for any particularapplication. The determination of the suitability of thematerial is solely the responsibility of the user. R1-1 Miscellaneous Notes on SECS-IR1-1.1 Layered Protocol (see Section 1.3.1)  Thelnternational Standards Organization (ISO) haspublished a model for Open Systems lnterconnection(OSI). The SECS-I protocol both predates the ISO/OSImodel and is not a true "open system" and, therefore,does not correspond exactly to the ISO/OSI model. TheSECS-I protocol is a communications interface ratherthan a network protocol. However, the SECS-I levelscan be roughly compared to layers 1 through part oflayer 5 of the ISO/OSI model. ISO/OSI layer 1, thephysical link layer, corresponds to the SECS-I physicallink. ISO/OSI layer 2, the data link layer, correspondsto the SECS-I block transfer protocol. lSO/OSI layer 3,the network layer, is a function of the host and is notdefined in SECS-I beyond the provision for a bi-directional flow (see Section 6.2). Similarly, networkmanagement is assumed to be the responsbility of thehost. ISO/OSI layer 4, the transport layer, is covered bythe SECS-I block transfer protocol, duplicate blockdetection, and the message protocol. ISO/OSI layer 5,the session layer, is partially covered by the SECS-Imessage protocol.R1-1.2 Single Timer for T1 and T2 (see Section 5.3) A single timer can be used for both the inter-charactertimer and the protocol timer, since both are the timebetween receiving successive characters and both limitsare never in effect at the same time.R1-1.3 Stalling (see Section 5.8.2)  The line controlportion of the block transfer protocol has the ability todelay the acceptance of a data block by not respondingwith an EOT immediately after receiving an ENQ. Suchan action by the receiver is called "Stalling." If thedelay exceeds the sender's T2 value, the sender willsend another ENQ. This can be continued dependingupon the sender's setting of T2 and RTY. Such a delayshould be an occasional convenience to accommodaterandom short delays in the receiver's ability to accept a new block and should not be counted upon routinely tomake up for poor response. In particular, the blocktransfer protocol should probably have at least twobuffers available for storing incoming blocks. Thisallows one block to be inspected by the messageprotocol while the next block is being received, thusallowing a reasonably continuous reception of data. Ifboth buffers are full and the message protocol is slow infreeing the buffer for the block transfer protocol, thenthe block transfer protocol will start stalling the sender.If the sender is stalled long enough, it will declare asend error, which is probably the correct thing to do.The sender cannot distinguish between a reluctance toreceive and failure in the communications. In eithersituation, since no block gets through in apredetermined time limit, the communications link iseffectively broken. Arbitrarily long delays are notacceptable in SECS-I.R1-1.4 Determining the Cause of an NAK (see Section5.8.5) The block transfer protocol does not include away for a sender to determine the cause of an NAK. Ifsuch information is useful for application purposes, itmust be collected at the receiving end.R1-1.5 Master Sending a Long Message (see Section5.8) When the master is sending a long message, theslave may be unable to send a block, which may resultin timeouts. It is good practice for the master tointroduce enough delay between blocks so that the slavehas a chance to send a block every few seconds.R1-1.6 Device Identification (see Section 6.3) Although the 15 bits of the device ID can identify32,767 different devices, the host may find it moreconvenient to use the upper seven bits to identify thetype of device such as a spinner or diffusion furnace,and to use the lower eight bits to identify the specificdevice of that type.R1-1.7 Sending Multiple Open Messages (see Section7.2.4) The message protocol algorithms defined inthe standard are capable of inter-leaving the blocks ofany number of open multi-block messages. Since thereceiving protocol is sensitive to the time betweenblocks of each message being received, it is properprocedure for the sending algorithm to alternatebetween messages when sending blocks frominterleaved multi-block messages.R1-1.8 Single Timer for T3 and T4 (see Sections 7.3.2and 7.4.3)  For a given transaction, a single timer canbe used for both the inter-block timer and the replytimer, since both are the time between receivingsuccessive blocks of a message, and both limits arenever in effect at the same time.

&lt;!-- Page 3 --&gt;

SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 199915 R1-2 IsolationR1-2.1 As mentioned in Section 3.4, the standard RS-232-C line does not provide isolation between thegrounds of remote equipment and a central computer. Itis often desirable to provide isolation to minimizecommunications errors and to protect equipment. Thefollowing example is provided here to illustrate howsuch an isolation might be provided between twodevices using RS-232-C, while at the same timeproviding the capability to drive longer lines. Thisdescription is provided for information only and is notpart of the standard.R1-2.2 Figure R1-1 illustrates a possible circuit forisolation which provides line isolation and line drivingcapability. The two wires used to provide power to theremote isolator are required since any local powersupply would have the same isolation problems as thedata wires. The power wires also eliminate extrasupplies at every terminal or remote device. There aremany other possible circuits. This example has beenused successfully and works quite well at 9600 baud forlines less than 300 meters and illustrates the use of thevoltages on pins 18 and 25 as mentioned in 3.2.4. R1-3 Examples of Block Transfer ProtocolR1-3.1 Figures R1-2 and R1-3 illustrate some simplemessage interactions between the host and theequipment. Figure R1-2 shows the handshake sequencepossible to acquire the status of the equipment. Fig-ureR1-3 shows the sequence of events when both the hostand the equipment try to send at the same time. Figure R1-2Ask for Status Figure R1-3Contention Resolution R1-4 Use of Buffers in the Block TransferProtocolR1-4.1 In the flow chart of the Block Transfer Protocol(Figure 2), the flow chart entry "LISTEN" implies thatcharacters are recognized after entering the given stateand not before. If the particular implementation usesbuffers and stores all of the characters received beforethe "LISTEN" state is achieved, care must be taken inthe proper handling of the data in the buffer to avoidproblems due to "timing windows" between sendingand receiving.R1-4.2 If the buffer is cleared before sending the lastcharacter prior to the "LISTEN" (last checksum byte insending a message, ENQ or EOT in line control), thereis still a time, albeit small, where spurious characterscould be received into the buffer.R1-4.2.1 In addition, during the sending of themessage, a delay between the checksum bytes while thebuffer is cleared may cause an inter-character timeoutby the receiver. If the buffer is cleared after the lastcharacter sent before the "LISTEN," there is apossibility that the desired character will be clearedfrom the buffer.R1-4.3 One solution is to look at the buffer afterentering the "LISTEN" state and examine the lastcharacter in the buffer, if any are there. This workswhile listening for an EOT after sending an ENQ. In thecase where the sender is listening for an ACK aftersending the second checksum byte, it is possible thatthe receiver also has a block to send, and follows the

&lt;!-- Page 4 --&gt;

SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 1999 16 ACK immediately with an ENQ. In this case the lastcharacter in the buffer might be an ENQ, and so the lasttwo characters should be examined. If an ACKprecedes the ENQ, then it should be assumed that theblock was sent successfully, and the ENQ should besaved for establishing line control (i.e., send an EOT, oran ENQ if there is contention).R1-4.4 The handling of the buffer when listening forthe length byte is not improved by this suggestion. Thebuffer should be cleared after the ENQ is received andbefore the EOT is sent. Spurious characters receivedbefore the length byte will cause a send failure. Figure R1-4Possible Bock Header Structure R1-5 System BytesR1-5.1 This section presents a sample scheme forgenerating and managing the system bytes field of theblock header. There are many possible implementationswhich meet the requirements of SECS-I. This sectiondescribes one of those implementations.R1-5.2 Source ID and Transaction ID  The systembytes are divided into two parts, a source ID and atransaction ID, as shown in Figure R1-4.R1-5.3 Distinct source IDs are assigned to eachapplication level originator of primary messages in ahost or equipment. This allows a secondary message tobe routed to the source of the corresponding primarymessage of the transaction. The transaction ID is aninteger that is incremented for each primary messagesent by the SECS-I interface. It is the same for allblocks of a multi-block message. R1-5.4 Actions  When a SECS-II message is passedto the SECS-I protocol, the least significant bit of thelower message ID is examined to determine whether themessage is primary (bit 1 = 1) or secondary (bit 1 = 0)message. If the message is primary, transaction ID isgenerated and placed in the transaction ID portion ofthe system bytes. One method for generating thetransaction ID is to start with a value of 0 uponinitialization, and increment by 1 for each newtransaction, starting with 1 (not 0) when the largesttransaction ID value has been used. At the same time,the application sender's source ID is placed in thesource ID portion of the system bytes. If the message issecondary, the system bytes are the same as those of thecorresponding primary message. It is assumed that theapplication generating the reply can identify the reply tothe message protocol, which has saved the system bytesfrom the primary message.R1-5.5 Block Send Failures (see Sections 5.8.2 and6.8.1)  Since it is a requirement that the system bytesbe distinct from those used in blocks that were notsuccessfully sent since the last successful block send,the use of two bytes for the transaction ID wouldeffectively satisfy the requirement by allowing for up to65,536 consecutive block send failures. R1-6 Using SECS in a NetworkR1-6.1 The SECS standard can be used to control theflow of data within a network of computers. A networkis an interconnection of computers or intelligentcontrollers communicating with one another overcommunications lines. Each intelligent entity is a nodeof the network. Each node may have a number ofconnections to other members of the network.R1-6.2 One connection of equipment and computers isin the form of a tree network with the processingequipment at the ends of branches as shown in FigureR1-5. Intermediate Nodes A and B service like piecesof equipment; i.e., all the furnaces to Node A, allmasking to Node B, and so on, for more nodes.R1-6.3 Node A monitors the three stations 1A, 2A, and3A. Node A handles most of the normal requirementsof coordinating 1A, 2A, and 3A. Node A receivesinstructions from Node C regarding the behaviordesired from 1A, 2A, and 3A. A CRT or operatorinterface connected to Node A is shared by 1A, 2A, and3A. Any node can direct messages up or down the tree.A message such as an alarm can be sent from 1A toNode A and from Node A to Node C which might beconsidered the host of the network. Node A might bepart of a system supplied by a company which has itsown communications scheme for devices tied to NodeA. As long as the company provides one connection toNode A which is consistent with this standard, then

&lt;!-- Page 5 --&gt;

SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 199917 Node A and its attached equipment can be connected tothe host, Node C, and collectively be called one node. Figure R1-5Tree NetworkR1-6.4 This tree structure can be extended even furtheras shown in Figure R1-6 to include multiplemanufacturing plants at remote sites. However, theprimary intent of this standard is to address thecommunication between processing equipment and ahost. At higher levels of the tree, the message iscombined with more system level messages and morecomputer file manipulations. At these levels, thecommunications may require more complex or higherspeed standards. Thus, the SECS line is intended to beused within one integrated circuit manufacturing arearather that between general purpose computer centers,although its only limitations for such a use would bespeed. Figure R1-6Extended Tree Network for a Large OrganizationR1-6.5 The tree network is characterized by the factthat there is only one possible path between any two nodes in the network. This feature makes handlingmessages in the tree network relatively easy whencompared to networks where more than onecommunication path exists between nodes. In theselatter networks, the nodes must make some judgmentabout which path to take, perhaps based on theconditions of the lines or on the destination of themessage.R1-6.6 The device ID and the R (Reply) bit play animportant role in directing messages in the network.Each node of the three maintains a table of the devicebelow it. From the device code, it knows on whichbranch to send the data. When a message is going fromthe central node toward the device, the R-bit is set to 0.When a message is being sent from the device up thetree, the R-bit is set to 1. When a node sees the R-bit setto 1, the message must take the one communicationdirection that goes up the tree structure. Thus, the R-bitserves to direct messages up the tree or down the tree,depending on its value. At any given node, thisbehavior may be explained in Figure R1-7. Figure R1-7Message Handling at a Node by Using the R-Bit R1-7 The General Node Transaction ProtocolR1-7.1 The transaction protocol has three primaryfunctions. First, it coordinates the receiving ofmessages that arrive in multiple blocks. Second, itprovides a mechanism for matching primary andsecondary messages. Third, it does error detection onincomplete messages whether they are due to a breakduring multiple blocks or a lack of reply messages. Thethird function is vital to the maintenance of a workingsystem, as can be seen from the following discussion.Once a transaction is begun with the first block of aprimary message, the receiving machine will have somememory allocated to buffering or pointing tointerpreting modules. If the transaction remainsincomplete for some reasonable length of time, it may

&lt;!-- Page 6 --&gt;

SEMI E4-0699 © SEMI 1980, 1999 18 be assumed that an error has occurred and the receivingmachine should release any memory it may be holdingfor the transaction. If memory were to remain allocatedto incomplete transactions, conceivably the receivingmachine could run out of available memory and wouldbe unable to function properly. For this reason, the errordetection of incomplete transactions is an essential partof the message transaction protocol in SECS-I.R1-7.2 The message transaction protocol is based on asystem of timers called transaction timers. These timersare maintained in software and are associated with agiven transaction. Once a transaction is begun, therewill exist a timer on the time interval between all blocksof the transaction independent of the direction of themessage. The machine that expects to receive a blockhas the burden of timing and error detection. Timers arerequired in any machine that (1) makes a request andexpects to receive data back; (2) must receive multipleblock requests; or (3) sends data and expects anacknowledgement. A machine may require severaltransaction timers if it can conduct multiple transactionsat one time on one port or has multiple ports. Amessage timer will exist for each link involved in thetransaction. This allows the error detection to identifythe particular link which has failed.R1-7.3 A general algorithm can be constructed tohandle an arbitrary number of SECS ports. Such analgorithm is presented in the form of a flow chart inFigure R1-8. There is one such algorithm for eachdevice ID. The algorithm handles all SECS data blocksthat enter, leave or pass the device ID. A new blockcauses the procedure to be executed starting from thepoint marked "block in" and continues until the pointmarked "block out." The block of data will then bedirected to the proper destination.R1-7.4 This algorithm makes use of a stored version ofthe message header for each transaction being handled.The stored header may be visualized as shown in FigureR1-9. The stored header has two system areas and anassociated transaction timer. The two system areas arerequired to keep the incoming and the outgoing systemareas independent in coding, yet related in meaning.The two system areas are referred to by the state of the R-bit in the message block header. One area is relatedto R = 0 and the other R = l. When a prime message isreceived that requires a reply, the system bytes from theblock are stored in the system area corresponding to theopposite state of the R bit on the message. When thereply is sent, the system bytes are used from the storesystem bytes corresponding to the same R-bit as thereply. The system area corresponding to the same R-bitas the message is called OUTSYS while the systemarea corresponding to the opposite R-bit is calledINSYS.R1-7.5 When a block is presented to this algorithm, thefirst task is to determine if the block is part of anongoing transaction, the first block of a newtransaction, or some other unknown block. This test isaccomplished by comparing the header of the blockwith the stored headers. If a match is not found, then acheck is made to see if the block is the first of a primarymessage. If this is true, then a new header is added tothe stored header list. If the primary message is onlyone block long and requires no reply, then no storedheader is created. When a match is found, the algorithmmodifies the stored header so that it will look like thenext block of the transaction to be expected. On allblocks requiring a stored header, except the last, atransaction timer is set to a timeout value prior tosending the block to its destination. The last part of thealgorithm directs the block to its destination or detectsan error in the destination.R1-7.6 Error recovery is an important part of thealgorithm to ensure that the system will remainoperational in spite of bad data blocks. For any blockthat does not pass the tests described in the algorithm,the header of the message is saved and sent in the hostdirection on a Stream 9 error message. This informationcan be useful in tracking down the source of the error.Another type of error occurs when one of thetransaction timers times out. Such an error messagemeans that the transaction has been interrupted. Anerror message is formed which sends the stored headerin the host direction on Stream 9. The stored header andthe timer are then released. This procedure aids inkeeping software cleared and ready in case ofdifficulties in the network.

SEMI E5-1104 © SEMI 1982, 2004 2 1 Purpose1.1 The SEMI Equipment Communications StandardPart 2 (SECS-II) defines the details of the interpretationof messages exchanged between intelligent equipmentand a host. This specification has been developed incooperation with the Japan Electronic IndustryDevelopment Association Committee 12 on EquipmentCommunications.1.1.1 It is the intent of this standard to be fullycompatible with SEMI Equipment CommunicationsStandard E4 (SECS-I). It is also the intent to allow forcompatibility with alternative message transferprotocols. The details of the message transfer protocolrequirements are contained in Section 6.1.1.2 It is the intent of this standard to define messagesto such a level of detail that some consistent host soft-ware may be constructed with only minimal knowledgeof individual equipment. The equipment, in turn, maybe constructed with only minimal knowledge of thehost.1.1.3 The messages defined in the standard support themost typical activities required for IC manufacturing.The standard also provides for the definition of equip-ment-specific messages to support those activities notcovered by the standard messages. While certain activ-ities can be handled by common software in the host, itis expected that equipment-specific host software maybe required to support the full capabilities of theequipment. 2 Scope2.1 SECS-II gives form and meaning to messagesexchanged between equipment and host using amessage transfer protocol, such as SECS-I.2.1.1 SECS-II defines the method of conveyinginformation between equipment and host in the form ofmessages. These messages are organized intocategories of activities, called streams, which containspecific messages, called functions. A request forinformation and the corresponding data transmission isan example of such an activity.2.1.2 SECS-II defines the structure of messages intoentities called items and lists of items. This structureallows for a self-describing data format to guaranteeproper interpretation of the message.2.1.3 The interchange of messages is governed by a setof rules for handling messages called the transactionprotocol. The transaction protocol places some mini-mum requirements on any SECS-II implementation.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 SECS-II applies to equipment and hosts used in themanufacturing of semiconductor devices. Examples ofthe activities supported by the standard are: transfer ofcontrol programs, material movement information,measurement data, summarized test data, and alarms.3.1.1 The minimum compliance to this standardinvolves meeting the few constraints outlined in Section8. It is expected that a given piece of equipment willrequire only a subset of the functions described in thisstandard. The number of functions and the selection offunctions will depend upon the equipment capabilitiesand requirements. For each piece of equipment, theexact format for each function provided must be docu-mented according to the form outlined in Section 10.3.1.2 It is assumed that the equipment will define themessages used in a particular implementation of SECS-II. It is assumed the host will support equipmentimplementation. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E4  SEMI Equipment CommunicationsStandard 1 Message Transfer (SECS-I)SEMI E6  Guide for Semiconductor EquipmentInstallation Documentation4.2 ANSI Standard1 ANSI X3.4-1977  Code for Information Interchange(ASCII)4.3 IEEE Standard2 IEEE 754  Standard for Binary Floating PointArithmetic4.4 The Japan Electronic Industry DevelopmentAssociation (JEIDA) has requested that the SECS-IIstandard incorporate support for the JIS-8 codes fordata exchange.

It is theintent of this standard to allow for compatibility withalternative message transfer protocols. The purpose ofthis section is to define the requirements of theinteraction between an application using SECS-II andthe message transfer protocol. The methods used toimplement these requirements are not covered as a partof this standard. The terms used in this standard arethose used by SECS-I. Equivalent terms may bedifferent for other message transfer protocols.6.2 Messages  The message transfer protocol is usedto send messages between equipment and host. Themessage transfer protocol must be capable of sending aprimary message, indicating whether a reply isrequested; and, if a reply is requested, it must becapable of associating the corresponding secondarymessage or reply message with the original primarymessage. The term originator will refer to the creatorof the original primary message. The term interpreterwill refer to the entity that interprets the primary

&lt;!-- Page 12 --&gt;

SEMI E5-1104 © SEMI 1982, 2004 4 message at its destination and generates a reply whenrequested.6.3 Blocking Requirements  The message transferprotocol must support the following SECS-II messageblocking requirements.6.3.1 Single-Block Messages  SECS-II requires thatcertain messages be sent in a single block or singlepacket by the message transfer protocol. Thosemessages defined in this standard as single-blockSECS-II messages must be sent in a single-block orpacket. The method used by the application software totell the message transfer protocol that a particularmessage must be sent as a single block is not covered aspart of this standard. For compatibility with SECS-I,the maximum length allowed for a single-block SECS-II message is 244 bytes. The minimum requirement forthe message transfer protocol is to be able to sendsingle-block SECS-II messages.6.3.2 Multi-Block Messages  For compatibility withSECS-I, SECS-II messages that are longer than 244bytes are referred to as multi-block messages. Also,certain SECS-II messages are allowed to be multi-blockmessages even if they otherwise meet the single-blocklength requirements. Certain older implementationsmay impose application-specific requirements on blocksizes for certain incoming messages. Beginning withthe 1988 revision of the standard, new applications maynot impose application-specific requirements onincoming block sizes. Applications implementedbefore 1988 may impose such requirements.6.4 Message Header  The message transfer protocolmust provide the following information, called themessage header, with every message. Only the contentof the message header is defined by this standard. Theexact format of the message header passed between theapplication and the message transfer protocol is notcovered as part of this standard.NOTE 1: In SECS-I, this information is contained in the 10-byte header of each block of a message.6.4.1 Device ID  The message transfer protocol mustbe capable of identifying the device ID (032767)which indicates the source or destination of a message.6.4.2 Stream and Function  The message transferprotocol must be capable of identifying to SECS-II aminimum15-bit message identification code. In SECS-II, messages are identified by a stream code (0127, 7bits) and a function code (0255, 8 bits). Eachcombination of stream and function represents a distinctmessage identification.6.4.3 Reply Requested  The message transferprotocol must be capable of identifying whether a replyis requested to a primary message. 6.5 Transaction Timeout  It is presumed that themessage transfer protocol will notify SECS-II in theevent of failure to receive an expected reply messagewithin a specified transaction timeout period.NOTE 2: In SECS-I, a transaction timeout occurs if either thereply timeout (T3) is exceeded before the first block of a replymessage is received or if the inter-block timeout (T4) isexceeded before an expected block of a multi-block messageis received.6.6 Multiple Open Transactions  This standardallows, but does not require, the support of more thanone concurrent open transaction. 7 Streams and Functions7.1 Streams  A stream is a category of messagesintended to support similar or related activities.7.2 Functions  A function is a specific message for aspecific activity within a stream. All the functions usedin SECS-II will follow a numbering conventioncorresponding to primary and secondary message pairs.All primary messages will be given an odd-numberedfunction code. The reply message function code isdetermined by adding one to the primary messagefunction code. The even-numbered function followinga primary message which requests no reply is reservedand is not to be used. Function code 0 is reserved in allstreams for aborting transactions as described inSection 10.4.7.3 Stream and Function Allocation  Some of thestream and function code combinations are reserved forthis standard, while others are available for userdefinition. The stream and function codes reserved forthis standard are as follows:In Stream 0, Functions 0255.In Streams 163, Functions 063.In Streams 64127, Function 0.The stream and function codes available for userdefinition are as follows:In Streams 163, Functions 64255.In Streams 64127, Functions 1255.7.3.1 The stream and function code assignment canalso be represented by the diagram shown in Figure 1.

It is recognized that there will beuser needs beyond the specific definitions given in thisstandard. In these situations, the streams and functionsreserved for user definition should be used subject tothe guidelines for minimum compliance outlined inSection 8. 8 Transaction and Conversation Protocols8.1 Intent  For an implementation to be incompliance with SECS-II, it must meet the minimumtransaction requirements outlined in this section. Theconversation protocols serve to further define the useand interaction between transactions.8.2 Transaction Definition  A transaction forms thebasis for all information exchanges in SECS-II. Atransaction consists of either a primary message forwhich no reply is requested, or a primary messagewhich requests a reply together with its correspondingsecondary message. Secondary messages cannotrequest a reply.8.3 Transaction Level Requirements  The followingare the requirements to comply with the SECS-IIprotocol at the transaction level:1. Respond to S1F1 with S1F2 as described inSection 10.5.2. For any received message that cannot be processedby the equipment, send the appropriate errormessage on Stream 9. As described in Section10.13, S9F1, F3, F5, F7, or F11 are possible. 3. Format any other supported messages according toSection 10.4. Upon detection of a transaction timeout at theequipment, send S9F9 to the host.5. Upon receipt of function 0 as a reply to a primarymessage, terminate the related transaction. Noerror message should be sent to the host by theequipment.8.4 Conversation Protocols  A conversation is aseries of one or more related transactions used tocomplete a specific task. A conversation shouldinclude all transactions necessary to accomplish thetask and leave both the originator and interpreter free ofresource commitments at its conclusion.8.4.1 Conversation Timeout  A conversation timeoutis used to indicate that a conversation has notcompleted properly. A conversation timeout isapplication-dependent, and the methods used fordetecting conversation timeouts are not covered as partof this standard. A conversation timeout will terminatefurther action on the conversation, and will allow forthe clearing of any committed resources. Upondetection of a conversation timeout at the equipment,S9F13 should be sent to the host.8.4.2 Types of Conversations  There are seven typesof conversations which characterize all informationexchanges in SECS-II:1. A primary message with no reply is the simplestconversation. This message must be a single-blockSECS-II message. The originator must assume thatthe interpreter responds to the message. Thisconversation is used where the originator can donothing if the message is rejected.2. If the interpreter has data that the originator wants,the data are requested with a primary message andthe data returned to the originator as a replymessage. It is assumed that the originatorrequesting the data is prepared to receive theamount of data returned. This is the request/dataconversation.3. If the originator wishes to send data in a single-block SECS-II message to the interpreter, then theoriginator sends the data and expects anacknowledgment from the interpreter. This is thesend/acknowledge conversation.4. If the originator has a multi-block SECS-IImessage to send for a particular exchange, then theoriginator must receive permission from theinterpreter prior to sending the data. The firsttransaction requests permission to send, and theinterpreter either grants or denies permission. If

&lt;!-- Page 14 --&gt;

SEMI E5-1104 © SEMI 1982, 2004 6 permission is granted, the originator sends the dataand the interpreter replies appropriately. This isthe inquire/grant/send/acknowledge conversation.Between the inquire and the send, the interpretermay commit some resources in preparation for thedata. Consequently, a conversation timeout may beset by the interpreter at a time dependent upon theapplication, at which time the interpreter will freeits resources and send an S9,F13 error message tothe originator. Note that under the definition ofS9,F13 in this standard, only the equipment shouldgenerate an error message to the host under theseconditions.5. There is a conversation related to the transfer ofunformatted data sets between equipment and host.This conversation is described in detail in Stream13. (See Section 10.17)6. There is a conversation related to the handling ofmaterial between equipment. This conversation isdescribed in detail in Stream 4. (See Section 10.8)7. The originator may request information from theinterpreter which requires some time to obtain(e.g., operator input is required). The firsttransaction requests the information and theinterpreter responds in one of three ways: 1) theinformation is returned, 2) the interpreter indicatesthat the information cannot or will not be obtained,or 3) the interpreter indicates that the informationwill be obtained and returned in a subsequenttransaction, as specified for this conversation. Forcase number 3, the interpreter will initiate thesubsequent transaction when the information isavailable.8.4.2.1 Case 3 is the request/acknowledge/send/acknowledge transaction.8.4.2.2 The originator of the request/acknowledge/send/acknowledge conversation may commit someresources in anticipation of the send/acknowledgetransaction. Consequently, a conversation timeout maybe set by the originator at a time dependent on theapplication. On timeout, the originator will free itsresources and restart the conversation with therequest, or send an S9,F13 error message. Note thatunder the definition of S9,F13 in this standard, only theequipment should generate an error message to the hostunder these conditions.8.4.3 The key words, request, data, send, acknowledge,inquire, and grant are used in the function names as anaid to understanding the relationship between themessages and the conversation. Single message trans-actions do not use these words. 9 Data Structures9.1 Intent  All information transmitted according tothis standard will be formatted using two data struc-tures, items and lists. These data structures define thelogical divisions of the message, as distinct from thephysical divisions of the message transfer protocol.They are intended to provide a self-describing internalstructure to messages passed between equipment andhost.9.2 Item  An item is an information packet whichhas a length and format defined by the first 2, 3, or 4bytes of the item. These first bytes are called the itemheader (IH). The item header consists of the formatbyte and the length byte(s) as shown in Figure 2. Bitsone and two of the item header tell how many of thefollowing bytes refer to the length of the item. Thisfeature allows for long items without requiring the byteoverhead for shorter items. The item length refers tothe number of bytes following the item header, calledthe item body (IB), which is the actual data of the item.The item length refers only to the item body notincluding the item header, so the actual number of bytesin the message for one item is the item length plus 2, 3,or 4 bytes for the item header. All bytes in the itembody are in the format specified in the format byte. No. oflength bytesitem format codelengthlengthlength MSB MSB LSB LSB 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 bit MS byte LS byte 1 432 &#123; Formatbyte Lengthbytes No. of Length bytes0 = Illegal, data format error1 = One binary length byte (max = 255)2 = Two binary length bytes (max = 64k)3 = Three binary length bytes (max = 7.99M)Length refers to the number of bytes except in a list format where itrefers to the number of elements (items or lists) in the list.Figure 2Item and List Header 9.2.1 A zero-length in the format byte is illegal andproduces an error. A zero-length in the item lengthbytes has a special meaning as defined in the detailedmessage definitions.9.2.2 Bits 3 through 8 of the format byte of the itemheader define the format of the data which follows. Ofthe 64 possible formats, 16 are defined as shown inTable 1. Format code 0 is called a list and is defined inSection 9.3. Format code 22 (octal) is called a localizedstring and is defined in Section 9.4. The remaining 14item formats define unspecified binary, code 10 (octal);Boolean, code 11 (octal); ASCII character strings, code20 (octal); JIS-8 character strings, code 21 (octal)

These formats are used forgroups of data which have the same representation inorder to save repeated item headers. In signed integers,negative values will be twos complement values.Floating point numbers will conform to the IEEEstandard 754. Boolean values will be byte quantities,with zero being equivalent to false, and non-zero beingequivalent to true.9.3 List  A list is an ordered set of elements, wherean element can be either an item (Section 9.2) or a list.The list header (LH) has the same form as an itemheader with format type 0. However, the length bytesrefer to the number of elements in the list rather than tothe number of bytes. The list structure allows groupingitems of related information which may have differentformats into a useful structure.9.3.1 A zero-length in the format byte is illegal andproduces an error. A zero-length in the list length byteshas a special meaning, which is defined in the detailedmessage definitions.Table 1 Item Format CodesFormat Code(Bit 876543)Meaning Binary Octal Data after the heading has the followingform000000 00 LIST (length in elements)001000 10 Binary001001 11 Boolean010000 20 ASCII 1010001 21 JIS-8010010 22 2-byte character2, 4011000 30 8-byte integer (signed) 2011001 31 1-byte integer (signed)011010 32 2-byte integer (signed) 2011100 34 4-byte integer (signed) 2100000 40 8-byte floating point3100100 44 4-byte floating point3101000 50 8-byte integer (unsigned) 2101001 51 1-byte integer (unsigned)101010 52 2-byte integer (unsigned) 2101100 54 4-byte integer (unsigned) 21 Non-printing characters are equipment-specific.2 Most significant byte sent first.3 IEEE 754. The byte containing the sign bit is sent first.4 The code for Multi-byte character must be specified in the data inthe first 2 bytes of the TEXT item.NOTE: Changes in integer format codes may conflict with earlierimplementations. 9.4 Localized Character String Items  A localizedcharacter string is an item which is used for repre-senting a string of multi-byte characters. Because thereare many different encoding schemes and the informa-tion could be in any one of a number of languages,these characteristics must also be included in the item.Thus for localized character strings which use itemformat code 22 (octal), there is an additional localizedstring header (LSH) .9.4.1 This localized string header follows the itemheader and precedes the string. The localized stringheader is part of the item data, thus the length of theheader (2 bytes) is included in the length in the itemheader. The length of the localized string itself is thenumber of bytes that it occupies, regardless of thenumber of characters that represents the string. Thelocalized string header followed by the string togethercomprise the localized string item. For example, a 2byte localized string (which may represent a singlecharacter), because of the 2 byte length of the localizedstring header, will have a 4 byte length in the itemheader.9.4.2 The LSH is a 16 bit number which specifies theencoding method used for the string.
