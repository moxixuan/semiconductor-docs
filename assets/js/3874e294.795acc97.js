A4-1 IntroductionA4-1.1 The purpose of this section is to provide thenecessary information to enable trading partners to usethe ASC X12 standards for the exchange of electronicbusiness documents within the electronics industry.A4-1.2 The transmission, in the ASC X12 format, iscomprised of an outer envelope (transmission envelope)which identifies the sender and receiver. Within thetransmission envelope are one or more functionalgroups.A4-1.3 The functional groups are analogous to batchesof like documents (i.e., certificate of analysis, testresults, statistical results). Each functional groupcontains one or more transaction sets (electronicdocuments). Each transaction set is an orderedcollection of segments. Each segment is an orderedcollection of data elements.A4-1.4 Each segment has been assigned a two or threecharac-ter identifier.A4-1.5 This identifier marks the beginning of eachsegment. Each element within the segment is separatedby a data element separator character. ElectronicIndustry Data Exchange (EIDX) recommends the use ofthe asterisk (","*",") character as a data element separator. Asegment terminator character is used to mark the end ofa segment. A4-2 FormatA4-2.1 The ASC X12 segment hierarchy lists allsegments, in order, available from the ASC X12standard. The segment IDs that are shaded indicate thesegments utilized by EIDX. Following the ASC X12segment hierarchy is a detailed description of eachsegment in the order that they appear in the transactionset.A4-2.2 Each segment is listed with the segment ID andname, level (header, detail, or summary), loop (if thesegment is contained within a loop), loop repeat (for thefirst segment in the loop), requirement within thetransaction set, maximum use, purpose (as defined byASC X12), ASC X12 syntax notes, ASC X12comments for segment usage, and notes that explain theEDIX convention for this segment within thetransaction set. It is important to note all shaded text iseither an EDIX convention or EDIX terminology. Shaded coded lists refer to recommendations culledfrom the entire ASC X12 data element code list. Theunshaded areas contain definitions and comments fromthe ASC X12 standard.A4-2.3 The data element summary lists each dataelement, in order, for the segment; for each dataelement there is one line to identify referencedesignator, data element number, data element name,and attributes.A4-2.4 Below the one line summary are usage notesand ac-tual values identified for use.A4-2.5 Reference Designator  This is the segmentidentifier with the data element sequence numberwithin the segment.A4-2.6 Data Element Number  This is the numberassigned to the data element by ASC X12. This numbermay be used for direct refer-ence into the ASC X12Data Dictionary.A4-2.7 Data Element Name  This is the nameassigned to the data element by ASC X12, in the ASCX12 Data Dictionary.A4-2.8 Attributes  Each data element has three ANSIattributes: element usage, element type, andMinimum/Maximum length.A4-2.9 Element UsageM Mandatory DesignerThis is the segment identifier with the dataelement sequence number within the segment.O OptionalThe data element may be used if the segmentis used.X ConditionalThe data element may be used only if otherelements are used within the segment.The particular condition/relation will be statedin the Data Element Summary for the segmentwhen used."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 5 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,'SEMI T6-0697 \xa9 SEMI 1997, 2004 8 A4-2.10 Element TypeID IdentifierValues for the identifier-type data elements aretaken from a predefined list in the ASC X12data element dictionary.AN StringValues for the string-type data elements are asequence of any printable characters.DT DateValues for a date-type data element are in theformat YYMMDD.TM TimeValues for a time-type data element are in theformat HHMM expressed in a 24-hour clock.Nx NumericValues for a numeric data element are in animplied decimal format, where "X" indicatesthe number of places to the right of thedecimal point.i.e., N0 is a whole number (999.)N2 is 999.99R DecimalThis is a numeric field in character format,with a decimal point included.

Current edition approved by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on July 11, 2004. Initially available at ",(0,n.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.semi.org"},"www.semi.org")," September2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published in 1998; previously published April 2000. 1 Purpose1.1 This specification provides a marking symbologythat can be used to mark metal lead-frame strips. 2 Scope2.1 This specification defines the geometric and spatialrelationships and content (including the error checkingand correcting code) of rectangular two-dimensional (2-D), machine-readable, binary Data Matrix symbologyfor front-surface marking of metal lead-frame strips(also called strips). It may be used in conjunctionwith the alphanumeric marking codes specified inSEMI M12 and SEMI M13 or the bar code specified inSEMI T1.2.2 This specification defines a 22-character defaultmessage that is included in all marks, and option for upto 50 additional characters, for a total of 72 messagecharacters. An optional shorter message contains 12 to16 message characters; the resulting square field isnarrower but taller than the 22-character rectangularone.2.3 This specification provides a suggested location forthe code symbol. It also provides guidelines forspecifying other code locations when the suggestedlocation is not suitable for an application.2.4 Although this specification does not specify themarking techniques that may be employed whencomplying with its requirements, it is assumed that thesymbol will be obtained by laser scribing individualdots.NOTE 1: A mark survivability experiment is beingconducted by the SEMI North American Traceabilitycommittee. A report is available from SEMI: requestLeadframe Mark Survivability Report dated February,1999.2.5 Data Matrix symbology is applicable to a broadrange of lead-frame materials including copper andAlloy 42 in both bare and plated conditions. The formatand algorithms of this code are based on two-dimensional symbology specified in AIM InternationalSymbology Specification - Data Matrix. 2.6 This specification supports EIA Package MarkingSpecification by enabling individual die tracking in themanufacturing steps between die attach and devicepackaging marking.NOTE 2: Marking of each die, while in wafer form, prior todicing, could also accomplish this end.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M12  Specification for Serial AlphanumericMarking of the Front Surface of WafersSEMI M13  Specification for Alphanumeric Markingof Silicon WafersSEMI T1  Specification for Back Surface Bar CodeMarking of Silicon Wafers3.2 AIM International Technical Specifications1 AIM International Symbology Specification  DataMatrix3.3 ANSI Standards 2 ANSI/FACT-1  Data Application Identifier StandardANSI X3.4  American Standard Code forInformation Interchange (ASCII)NOTE 3: This standard is equivalent to ISO 646, InformationProcessing - ISO 7-bit Coded Character Set for InformationExchange3. 1 AIM International, Inc., 125 Warrendale-Bayne Road , Warrendale,PA 15086, Phone: 1 724 934 4470, Fax: 1 724 934 4495,",(0,n.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.aimglobal.org/2"},"http://www.aimglobal.org/2")," American National Standards Institute, Headquarters: 1819 LStreet, NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA.
