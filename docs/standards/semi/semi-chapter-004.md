SEMI E19.4-0998E © SEMI 1992, 20037 APPENDIX 1APPLICATION NOTES NOTICE: This appendix was approved as an official part of SEMI E19.4 by full letter ballot procedure, but therecommendations in this appendix are optional and are not required to conform to this standard. A1-1 NotesA1-1.1 Automated pod transfer between load port andautomated material handling system (AMHS) mightrequire a lead-in capability of more than 5 mm. Thiscan be achieved by increasing the height of the guiderails (dimension B5). SEMI standard E15 limits thisheight to 50 mm (1.97 inches) maximum (see FigureA1-1). The capture range can be increased to more than15 mm (0.6 inches) if supplier and customer agree toincrease the guide rail height without violating SEMIE15. Figure A1-1Optional Rail DimensionsA1-1.2 The dimensions of the pod bottom are notspecified in this standard (see Section 6.2.5.1). It isrecommended that these dimensions should not exceed282.0 mm (11.14 inches) in one direction and 292.6mm (11.52 inches) in the other direction. Thesemaximum outer dimensions ensure a sufficient gaparound the pod and the guide rails in relation to B1 andB2 to allow a reliable motion of the pod onto the portplate.A1-1.3 It is important that the external top of the poddoes not exceed the top of the cassette by more than 50mm (1.97 inches). This is to prevent possibleinterference between the pod and the equipment.

SEMI E20-0697 © SEMI 1991, 20021 SEMI E20-0697 (Reapproved 1102)CLUSTER TOOL MODULE INTERFACE: ELECTRICAL POWER ANDEMERGENCY OFF STANDARD This standard was technically approved by the Global Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee and is thedirect responsibility of the North American Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee. Current editionapproved by the North American Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee on July 21, 2002. Initiallyavailable at www.semi.org October 2002; to be published November 2002. Orignally published in 1991;previously published June 1997. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of the standard is to specify theEmergency Off capability to the modules of a clustertool; to allow module Emergency Off disconnect andreconnect in a safe manner without removing powerfrom the rest of the tool; and to prevent power frombeing applied to a module when its Emergency Off isnon-functional. 2 Scope2.1 The standard deals with the delivery andemergency interruption of electrical power to themodules of a cluster tool.2.2 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Impact3.1 The standard requires that power can be deliveredto an individual module only if its Emergency Off isfunctional. This does not preclude removal of powerfrom the module by non-emergency means.3.2 The standard specifies the Emergency Off circuitfunctions that must be provided at the Emergency Offinterfaces of a cluster tool, including the plug,momentary bypass switch and bypass jumper plug.Pinouts for the Emergency Off plug and bypass jumperplug are specified. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E21  Cluster Tool Module Interface:Mechanical Interface and Wafer Transport Standard4.2 Military Standards1 1 Available through the Naval Publications and Forms Center, 5801Tabor Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19120-5099, USA.

Each module EMO is connected to the chain atits EMO interface. A momentary bypass switch, alsolocated at each module EMO interface, allowsseparation of the module from the cluster tool withouttripping the EMO, provided that electrical power isremoved from the module by turning off the dedicatedcircuit breaker (see Related Information R1-4).

SEMI E20-0697 © SEMI 1991, 20023 RELATED INFORMATION 1 NOTE: The material contained in these application notes is not an official part of SEMI E20 and is not meant to modify orsupersede it in anyway. Rather, these notes are provided primarily as a source of information to aid in the application of thestandard. As such, they are to be considered as reference material only. The standard should be referred to in all cases. R1-1 AC Power DistributionR1-1.1 One method of providing power and EMOfunctions to a cluster tool is shown in Figure R1-1 (seeSection 6.1.2). A standby power supply (SPS) oruninterruptible power supply (UPS) is included tomaintain EMO and selected cluster tool functions in theevent of main power failure. It may be desirable toinclude additional circuit breakers in the main powerenclosure if individual module disconnects are neededat level I in Figure R1-1. Disconnect at level II inFigure R1-1 is made possible by the module circuitbreakers; SEMI E7, Electrical InterfacesSpecification, should be used for loads up to 10 kW.Additional main power enclosures could be providedfor modules with heavy AC loads, provided that eachmain contactor is operated by one common EMOcircuit, however, some users safety codes may demanda single source of supply. R1-2 Operation of Remote EquipmentR1-2.1 Activation of the EMO shall stop, by fail-safemeans at the tool, the delivery of potentially hazardousenergy (e.g., high voltage, laser) or hazardous material(e.g., toxic process gas, coolant) to the cluster tool (seeSection 6.1.3). R1-3 EMO Switch PlacementR1-3.1 The EMO switches on each module (seeSection 6.2.1) need to be placed so that they areaccessible to any person in the vicinity of the clustertool. Local safety codes may take precedence in mattersof EMO switch placement. The standard ensures thateach module has at least one EMO switch and that itsoperation, when the module is attached, removes powerfrom the entire cluster tool. R1-4 EMO BypassR1-4.1 Implementation  The functions, specified inSection 4.2.1, to allow EMO bypass and to ensure thatmodule power is off when the EMO is removed fromthe cluster tool EMO circuit, can be implemented asshown in Figure R1-2. A relay or switch, operated inparallel with the dedicated circuit breaker specified inSection 6.1.2 for the module, provides 24 VAC to thecoil of a double pole relay when the circuit breaker isde-energized. An indicator light in parallel with the coililluminates when the bypass is enabled and the powerto the module is off. One set of contacts of this relay is used to enable the momentary EMO bypass switch. Theother set is connected across pins 3 and 4 of the EMOreceptacle at the EMO interface and is in the EMOcircuit when the EMO bypass jumper plug is installed.Both sets of contacts are wired to open when voltage isremoved from the relay coil, i.e., when the circuitbreaker is closed.R1-4.2 Module Disconnect  The dedicated circuitbreaker (see Section 6.2.1) to the module must beturned off prior to disconnect. This causes the contactsin series with the momentary EMO bypass switch toclose, rendering it operational. At this point, the EMOswitch on the module is still in the cluster tool EMOcircuit. To disconnect, the operator holds in the EMObypass switch while removing the module EMO plugfrom the EMO interface and then connecting the EMObypass jumper plug. The momentary bypass switch canthen be released.R1-4.3 Module Connect  To connect a module, thededicated circuit breaker (see Section 6.2.1) must be offat the power distribution point to the module. Thepower cable may be attached to the module at this time.The operator holds in the momentary bypass switchwhile disconnecting the EMO bypass jumper plug fromthe EMO interface and connecting the module EMOPlug. The momentary bypass switch can then bereleased. Power cannot be applied to the module unlessthe EMO is connected (as shown in Figure R1-2).

SEMI E21-94 © SEMI 1991, 20021 SEMI E21-94 (Reapproved 1102)CLUSTER TOOL MODULE INTERFACE: MECHANICAL INTERFACEAND WAFER TRANSPORT STANDARD This standard was technically reapproved by the Global Physical Interfaces & Carriers Committee and is thedirect responsibility of the North American Physical Interfaces & Carriers Committee. Current editionreapproved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on July 21, 2002. Initially available atwww.semi.org October 2002; to be published November 2002. Originally published in 1991; previouslypublished in June 1999. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of the standard is to simplify clustertool implementation in the fab. Equipment suppliers arerequired to provide modules that can be connected intoany cluster tool using the specifications containedherein.1.1.1 Process and cassette modules accept wafers atlocations that may vary substantially from one moduleto another. This places a burden on the capabilities oftransport modules to move wafers to and from variousmodules in a cluster tool. This specification defineswafer transport planes within cassette and processmodules. This obviates the wafer transport problem to alarge extent, but does not unduly restrict modulecontent. 2 Scope2.1 The standard defines the interface plane betweenmodules in a cluster tool. It provides the mechanicalspecifications at the interface that allow modules fromdifferent suppliers to be connected together; norequirements are imposed on the module content.2.1.1 The standard is limited to wafers which are 200mm (~8 in.) in diameter or smaller and to the interfacebetween cluster tool modules, with the followingexception. The transport module operates across theinterface plane; thus, a definition of the wafer transportplane within cassette and process modules is required.2.2 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Impact3.1 The adoption of the standard requires cluster toolequipment designers to limit the wafer transport heightto a nominal value at the interface plane between twomodules. It also requires equipment designers to assurethat wafer transport planes within cassette and processmodules be clear for wafer transport. The transportmodule requires the capability for a minimum reach outside the module across the interface plane. Modulesmay be connected using a quick connect/disconnectclamping system. Constraints are placed on sealingsurfaces. 4 Referenced StandardsISO 1609-1986 (E)1  Vacuum Technology  FlangeDimensions, International Organization forStandardization (ISO). 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 cassette module  a two-port module.

The transport module is required topresent or accept a horizontal wafer outside the moduleanywhere along an axis perpendicular to the center ofthe interface plane to a maximum 305 mm (12 in.) fromthe interface plane. Thus, a transport module is requiredto have the capability to reach 305 mm (12 in.) beyondits interface plane to a wafer centroid (see Section R1-1). However, location of the wafer at a distance lessthan 305 mm (12 in.) from the interface plane requiresthat the transport module be capable of addressing theintermediate location. Similarly, a cassette module orprocess module accepts a horizontal wafer inside themodule anywhere along an axis perpendicular to thecenter of its interface plane up to a maximum 305 mm(12 in.) from the interface plane as required by theapplication.6.1.1.1 Placement Accuracy  The requirements forplacement accuracy of a wafer in the horizontal planewithin a module are 1.0 mm (0.04 in.) true position, ±0.5 mm (± 0.020 in.) radially, with less than one degreeangular rotation for every module-to-transport-to-module wafer transport (Bn:A:Bn + 1as shown in Figure1). If the wafer is displaced in the process module, itmust be returned to the original position within the non-culmulative placement accuracy of 1.0 mm (0.04 in.)true position, ± 0.5 mm (± 0.020 in.) radially.6.1.2 Vertical Position of Transport Plane  Theelevation of the wafer transport plane is measured fromthe facility floor as shown in Figure 2. The transportmodule is required to present or accept a horizontalwafer outside the module at a nominal wafer transport height of 1100 mm (43.307 in.) from the facility floor(see Section R1-2).6.1.2.1 Vertical Motion  The transport module isrequired to move the wafer to within ± 0.5 mm (0.020in.) in the wafer transport plane. The transport moduleis also required to posess a vertical motion capability toa second plane 6.0 mm ± 0.5 mm (0.236 in. ± 0.020 in.)below the wafer transport plane in order to allow waferhandoff to or from passive cassette or process modules(see Figure 2 and Section R1-3).6.1.2.2 Reference Plane  The interface planealignment pins define a reference plane 9.5 mm (0.374in.) below the wafer transport plane (see Figure 2).6.2 Interface Plane  The interface plane contains theinterface seal zone and the wafer transport zone, whichdo not overlap, and the location of the interface planealignment pins (see Figures 3 and 4).6.2.1 Interface Seal Zone  The interface seal zone isrectangular and symmetrically referenced to theinterface plane alignment pins. The inside boundarydimension of the interface seal zone is 46 mm (1.811in.) by 236 mm (9.291 in.). The outside boundary is 76mm (2.992 in.) by 266 mm (10.472 in.). A seal zone iseither a seal surface or an O-ring face. All interface sealzones facing toward a transport module are sealsurfaces polished to a surface finish less than or equal to0.8 micrometer (32 microinches) parallel to thecircumference (see Section R1-4). All interface sealzones facing toward a cassette or process module are O-ring faces equipped with the appropriate capture groovefor the sealing method employed (see Figure 3 andSection R1-4.1).6.2.2 Wafer Transport Zone  The wafer transportzone is the area within the interface seal zone reservedfor moving the wafer between modules. The wafertransport zone which cannot be compromised by anymodule is defined as the area at least 16 mm (0.630 in.)above and below the alignment pin centerlines, and 111mm (4.370 in.) to the left and right of the centerlinebetween the two alignment pins (see Figure 3 andSection R1-5).6.2.3 Interface Plane Alignment Pins  Provisions aremade for two 10 mm (0.394 in.) diameter locating pins(see Figure 4) to be used as alignment aids betweenmodules. Under no circumstances should the flanges atthe interface plane and the alignment pins be subject toa total load exceeding 500N (112 lbf) in shear. Thealignment pins have an absolute centerline separation of300.0 mm (11.811 in.) in the horizontal plane. The pinsreside in the seal surface side of the flange pair,opposite the O-ring, facing toward the transportmodule. Mild press fit holes are provided in the sealsurface flange face. A clearance hole and a slot are

SEMI E21-94 © SEMI 1991, 20023 provided in the O-ring flange face as shown in Figure 1and specified in Figure 3. Alignment pin height abovethe flange face is 6 mm (0.24 in.) minimum to 8 mm(0.31 in.) maximum (see Section R1-6).6.2.4 Isolation Valves  The transport module isalways equipped with a valve for environmentalisolation at each module interface plane. The intratooltransport port on a process or cassette module may beequipped with an environmental isolation valve (seeSection R1-7).6.3 Flange  A flange is specified as 162 mm (6.378in.) by 340 mm (13.386 in.). One horizontal edge isspecified to be 50 mm (1.969 in.) from the alignmentpins centerline (see Figure 4).6.3.1 Clamping  Clamping grooves as specified inthe International Standards Organization document,Vacuum Technology, Flange Dimensions (ISO 1609-1986), Table 2, nominal bores 40 mm-250 mm (1.575in.9.843 in.) are located at the flange perimeter (see groove detail in Figure 4). Clamps for ISO flanges canbe used to generate the force necessary to produce anenvironmental seal (see Section R1-8).6.3.2 Non-Flanged Surfaces  A non-flanged surfacemay be used to join with a flanged surface. Anattachment means to engage the flange must beprovided. If a flanged adaptor piece is necessary to jointwo non-flanged surfaces, then the adaptor piece shallbe located on the process or cassette side of theinterface plane.LIST OF FIGURESFigure 1  Module Interface with Wafer Transport andPlacement Detail (Plan View)Figure 2  Wafer Transport Plane ElevationFigure 3  Interface PlaneFigure 4  Flange Specification

SEMI E21-94 © SEMI 1991, 20027 RELATED INFORMATION 1 NOTE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E21 but was reapproved for publication by full letter ballotprocedures on July 21, 2002. R1-1 Transport Module ReachR1-1.1 The reach (see Section 4.1.1) permits a wafer of200 mm (8 in.) diameter or smaller to be placed on awafer support platform in a process chamber withallowance for the optional isolation valve on theprocess module and the chamber wall thickness. Thesubstantial clearance between the wafer and thechamber wall is to allow freedom for process-specificdesign requirements.R1-1.2 Individual process chamber designs may placethe wafer closer to the interface plane than 305 mm (12in.) and still conform to the standard.R1-1.3 Wafers are transported individually in ahorizontal attitude. Modules may contain any numberof wafers. For example, batch processing is allowed. R1-2 Vertical Position of Transport PlaneR1-2.1 The transport plane elevation of 1100 mm(43.307 in.) (see Section 4.1.2) is positioned within theconstraints placed on the cluster tool by the Inter-Equipment Automation requirement for cassetteplacement (SEMI E15). SEMI E15 specifies the loadheight for cassettes to be 900 mm (35.46 in.) ± 10 mm(0.394 in.) outside an environmental load-lock.R1-2.2 The vertical position of the transport plane isderived from the following contributions: 910 mm (35.854 in.) is a worst-case cassette loadheight position. 12 mm (0.473 in.) is a nominal pickup clearance tozero a wafer elevator indexer after the cassette isdrawn into the environmental load-lock. 178 mm (7.01 in.) is the location of the top slot in astandard 200 mm (8 in.) wafer carrier (SEMI E1.7).R1-2.3 These additive contributions assure that thetransport plane elevation allows as much space aspossible for location of support equipment such aspumps, electronics, and power supplies below theprocess chamber. The 1100 mm (43.307 in.) nominaldimension could be adjustable by the module(s) towithin ± 25 mm (1 in.). R1-3 Vertical MotionR1-3.1 The standard (see Section 4.1.2.1) requires thatthe transport module be capable of moving in twoplanes. An ability to move in other planes is optional. R1-3.2 The transport module moves the wafer in thehorizontal wafer transport plane (see Definition 3.12).The transport module has a vertical motion capabilityfor wafer handoff or pickup. It is assumed that thetransport module moves in the lower plane after waferhandoff or prior to wafer pickup. R1-4 Interface Seal ZoneR1-4.1 The interface seal zone (see Section 4.2.1) issufficiently wide to permit double seals withintermediate pumping.R1-4.2 Blank-Off Plates  The location of the seals onthe transport module allows plain blank-off plates to beused for environmental sealing. R1-5 Wafer Transport ZoneR1-5.1 The minimum specified height of 32 mm(1.184 in.) (see Section 4.2.2) provides sufficientclearance for passage of a knuckle joint or pivot pointin the transport module end effector (see SEMI E22,"Cluster Tool Module Interface: Transport Module EndEffector Exclusion Volume Standard") and for 6 mm(0.238 in.) of vertical motion. The wafer transport zonemay be expanded up to the boundary of the interfaceseal zone when a module requires a larger opening (seeSection 4.2.1 and Figure 3). R1-6 Interface Plane Alignment PinsR1-6.1 The standard (see Section 4.2.3) implies thenormal engineering practice of chamfering pin ends andcountersinking pin locating holes. Actual dimensionsfor this have been specified or recommended by otherauthorities.R1-6.2 Pins reside in the sealing surface to avoidaccidental damage to the surface finish during assemblyand disassembly. With centrally placed pins, valvesmay be mounted in either orientation if this simplifiesservicing or accessibility.R1-6.3 A clearance hole and slot arrangement allowsuse of dissimilar flange materials in a dynamic thermalenvironment. R1-7 Isolation ValvesR1-7.1 The standard (see Section 4.2.4) allows thevalves to be integral to the modules or discreteseparable units.

SEMI E21-94 © SEMI 1991, 2002 8 R1-8 ClampingR1-8.1 The standard (see Section 4.3.1) allows auniversal clamping scheme to be employed. Clawclamps designed for use with ISO flanges areaccommodated by the use of a perimeter groove aroundthe flange.R1-8.2 The clamping scheme provides several benefits: Independence from any hole pattern requirements. Flanges may be connected to flat plates or to otherflanges. The number of clamps and the number of sidesused to draw the flanges together may be varied asrequired by the compression forces necessary forthe sealing method used. For example, clamps maybe spaced on 30 mm (1.191 in.) centers for metalseals and on 150 mm (6 in.) centers for elastomericseals. Any type of clamp may be used that accommodatesthe perimeter groove.

Rather, these notes are provided primarily as a source of information to aid in theapplication of the standard. As such they are to be considered as reference material only. The standard should bereferred to in all cases. R1-1 Vertical RequirementsR1-1.1 Changes in vertical requirements are made because of the need to provide adequate transport arm stiffness(thickness) for the longer reach specified for 300 mm. However, for many processes, it is desirable to limit the slotsize as far as possible. An option is now allowed to reduce the vertical slot opening on the Attached Modules side ofthe Interface Plane (see Figure 1, E21), but any such reduction will compromise the space otherwise available fortransport arm vertical thickness and/or movement. Specification of the extent of this option will be needed in eachcase it is used. R1-2 Transport Maximum ReachA1-2.1 The maximum reach beyond the interface plane (see Table 1) is increased by 75 mm (from 305.0 mm to380.0 mm); a 50 mm increase in wafer radius (from 100 mm to 150 mm) and a 25 mm increase in clearance betweenthe wafer and the chamber walls. R1-3 Width RequirementsR1-3.1 The increase in wafer diameter from 200 mm to 300 mm necessitates a 100 mm increase in all width values(see Table 1) specified in SEMI E21.

Rather, these notes are provided primarily as a source of information to aid in the application of thestandard. As such, they are to be considered as reference material only. The standard should be referred to in all cases. R1-1 Wafer TransportR1-1.1 The standard (see Section 6.1) does not requirethat the entire transport module end effector move in ahorizontal attitude while the wafer does have thisrequirement. For example, the transport module endeffector may have a component of motion in a planeother than the horizontal during wafer transport acrossthe interface plane. R1-2 Variables  Definitions and DimensionsR1-2.1 The function of Table 2 (see Section 6.2) is tolist the numerical values for the wafer dependentvariables used in Figures 1 and 2. The values are wafersize dependent so as not to penalize the design of atransport module end effector when handling only smalldiameter wafers. For example, the physical size of atransport module end effector for a 100 mm diameterwafer may be smaller than that for a 200 mm diameterwafer. R1-3 Vertical Plane Exclusion ZoneR1-3.1 The development of the numeric valuesspecified in the standard (see Section 6.5) and given inFigure 2 are described below.R1-3.2 The 3 mm height above the wafer transportplane (defined in SEMI E21) allows for transportmodule end effectors which use contraints (e.g., acupped device or pins) to ensure the wafer does notslide. Also, this may be necessary if the wafer istransported with the circuit side facing down.R1-3.3 The 7 mm value allows for a 4 mm thicknessbelow the wafer transport plane to accommodate astructurally and thermally strong transport module endeffector design.R1-3.4 The 12.5 mm thickness allows for process orcassette modules with a minimum slot opening value ofless than 32 mm (see SEMI E21). R1-3.5 The 200 mm minimum length part of theexclusion zone allows for a transport module endeffector of limited reach to pass into modules with slotopenings smaller than the minimum value of 32 mm.R1-3.6 The 23 mm thickness allows for the presenceof a wrist joint or for additional rigidity in thetransport module end effector.R1-3.7 The 120 mm length is specified as a fixednumber to ensure that multiple wafer sizes (andtransport module end effectors) do not necessarilydemand a change in geometry of the receiving modulearound the wafer transport position.R1-3.8 The minimum nominal clearance above andbelow the exclusion zone is 1.5 mm on both sides of thetransport module end effector when it passes throughthe minimum slot opening. This takes into account theexclusion zone size due to the vertical travel thetransport module end effector may experience.R1-3.9 A subset of the vertical plane exclusion zone(see Figure R1-1) is required by a transport module endeffector which must access wafers directly from SEMIstandard or equivalent cassettes. The vertical planeexclusion zone described in the standard (see Figure 2)was not subject to these restrictions since a singlegeneric transport module end effector design was foundnot to be practical. R1-4 Transport Module End Effector ExclusionVolumeR1-4.1 This volume as described in Section 6.6 isintended to be the volume within which the transportmodule end effector has complete autonomy. Therefore,process and cassette modules are not allowed to violatethis volume during wafer transport. This preventsmechanical interference between the transport moduleend effector and the process or cassette module.

Current editionapproved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004. Initially available atwww.semi.org September 2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published in 1991; previouslypublished in 2002. 1 Purpose1.1 Cassette transfer between process equipment andtransport equipment is performed by means of amechanical operation in the interactive area andrequires quick response and reliable interlock signals.1.2 The purpose of this specification is to provide acassette transfer parallel input/output (I/O) interface forcontrol of the interface mechanism that supplements theSECS standard for material movement. 2 Scope2.1 This specification deals with the parallel I/Ointerface for the cassette transfer between two pieces ofequipment, such as a piece of process equipment and apiece of transport equipment.2.2 This standard defines the wire-connected parallelI/O interface between two pieces of equipment and thephoto-coupled parallel I/O interface between theprocess equipment and the transport equipment.2.3 The application of the parallel I/O interface to thecassette transport is as follows.2.4 Each piece of equipment is connected to the HOSTat the SECS interface, and each of the two pieces ofequipment between which the cassette transfer will bemade is connected at the parallel I/O interface as shownin Figure 1.2.5 The cassette transfer request, or load/unloadcommand, is notified by the SECS-II message. Theactual cassette transfer action is executed using theparallel I/O interface, interlocking each mechanism.(An example of a cassette transfer transaction using theparallel I/O interface is shown in Related Information1.)

SEMI E23-1104 © SEMI 1991, 20043 5 Parallel I/O Interface Specification5.1 This standard refers only to the cassette transfer between active and passive equipment.5.2 Wire-Connected Parallel I/O Interface Specification  The equipment is to have a parallel I/O interface for thepassive mode when it becomes passive, and the parallel I/O interface for the active mode when it becomes active.5.2.1 Signals for Each Cassette Stage  The cassette stage is to have the input/output signal lines listed in Table 1. Table 1 Signals for Each Cassette Stage (Wire-Connected Interface) Signal Type P/A DescriptionL\_REQ (LOADREQUEST)P-&gt;A This signal means that the CS can be loaded. The signal turns OFF when thecassette is detected on the CS. (The CS is a cassette stage.)U\_REQ (UNLOADREQUEST)P-&gt;A This signal means that the CS can be unloaded. The signal turns OFF when it isdetected that the cassette has been removed from the CS.READY P-&gt;A This signal means that the CS is in a state where it can be accessed by the activeequipment. It turns ON when the CS is in the READY state after the TR\_REQsignal from the active turns ON. The signal turns OFF by handshakes with theCOMPT signal.TR\_REQ (TRANSFERREQUEST)A-&gt;P This signal turns ON when the active equipment is going to start transferring thecassette. It turns OFF when the BUSY signal is OFF. (Active equipment startstransferring the cassette with the BUSY ON after recognizing the READY ON.) 5.2.2 Common Signals  The signals in Table 2 show the status of the cassette transfer action of the activeequipment. The CSs are allowed to input these signals commonly from active equipment. Table 2 Common Signals (Wire-Connected Interface)Signal Type P/A DescriptionBUSY A-&gt;P This signal turns ON when the active equipment starts transferring the cassette tothe CS while it is in READY and turns OFF after the robot has loaded or unloadeda cassette and has moved away from the interactive zone. The passive equipmentdoes not perform any mechanical action in the interactive zone while this signal isON.COMPT (COMPLETE) A-&gt;P This signal means the active equipment has completed the transfer action. It turnsOFF after handshaking with the READY signal.NOTE 1: It is recommended that the BUSY signal turn OFF after the active equipment has confirmed L\_REQ (or U\_REQ) isOFF. 5.2.3 Cassette Transfer Sequence  Time charts for the cassette transfer sequence are shown in Figures 3 (a) and(b).5.2.3.1 The TR\_REQ from the active equipment initiates the cassette transfer sequence. The active equipment startscarrying out the transfer action with the BUSY ON as soon as it recognizes that the READY signal of the passiveequipment is ON. The handshake is finished after the cassette transfer action has been completed.5.3 Photo-Coupled Parallel I/O Interface Specification  This interface is concerned only with the cassette transferbetween the process equipment and the transport robot vehicle. The robot vehicle is active and the processequipment is passive.5.3.1 This interface is defined between the robot and the cassette stages to which the robot can transfer a cassette atthe same stopping position.5.3.2 Signals  The signals for the photo-coupled parallel I/O interface are listed in Table 3. The CS\_0, CS\_1, andCS\_2 signals specifying the CS to or from which the active equipment transfers and the VALID signal indicatingeffectiveness of the data of CS\_0~CS\_2, are newly added to the signals defined in the wire-connected parallel I/Ointerface.

SEMI E23-1104 © SEMI 1991, 2004 4 Table 3 Signals for the Photo-Coupled Parallel I/O InterfaceSignal Type P/A DescriptionVALID A-&gt;P This signal remains high (ON) while the data of CS\_0, CS\_1, CS\_2 is effective.(The data of CS\_0, CS\_1, CS\_2 is not effective when VALID signal is OFF.)CS\_0 (LSB) CS\_1 CS\_2(MSB)A-&gt;P The 3-bit signals specify the cassette stage number (0 ~ 7) of the passive equip-ment, to or from which the active equipment (robot vehicle) is going to transfer acassette. They are set before the VALID signal turns ON. VALID andCS\_0~CS\_2 signal.TR\_REQ A-&gt;P This is the same in the wire-connected parallel I/O specification and is valid forthe specified CS.L\_REQ P-&gt;A This is the same in the wire-connected parallel I/O specification and is valid forthe specified CS.U\_REQ P-&gt;A This is the same in the wire-connected parallel I/O specification and is valid forthe specified CS.READY P-&gt;A This is the same in the wire-connected parallel I/O specification and is valid forthe specified CS.BUSY A-&gt;P This is the same in the wire-connected parallel I/O specification.COMPT A-&gt;P This is the same in the wire-connected parallel I/O specification. 5.3.3 Cassette Transfer Sequence  Time charts for the cassette transfer sequence in the case of the photo-coupledinterface are shown in Figure 4 (a) and (b). After the active equipment (robot vehicle) reaches the processequipment, it sets the CS\_0, CS\_1, CS\_2 3-bit-signals to specify the CS number of the passive equipment, to orfrom which the active equipment (robot vehicle) is going to transfer a cassette. Then the robot vehicle turns theVALID signal ON, which shows the date of the CS\_0, CS\_1, CS\_2 signal is effective. After the cassette stage isspecified, cassette transfer sequence is the same as in the wire-connected parallel I/O specification. TR\_REQ,L\_REQ,U\_REQ, READY signals show the data for the specified CS while the VALID signal is ON, and the CS\_0,CS\_1, CS\_2 signals are inhibited to change their data while the VALID signal is ON.5.4 Error Detection and Recovery  The cassette transfer using this interface in the practical manufacturing lineswill need handshake time interval control, cassette misalignment detection, and report of alarm or error to find anerror or abnormal termination in the cassette transfer. An error recovery procedure with appropriate assist by humanoperators will be also required. This standard, however, does not define the specifications related to the errordetection and recovery because of difference in process time, failure mode, and error recovery procedure ofindividual equipment and system.5.4.1 The recommendation for basic error detection is that the active equipment should control handshake timeintervals, and at least the interval time T between the beginning of the cassette transfer and the end of the transfershould be controlled  see the time chart of the cassette transfer sequence shown in Figures 3(a), 3(b), 4(a), and4(b), describing the time chart of the cassette transfer sequence.

Each module thathas an isolation valve must use the interlock providedby the module it is joined to across their commoninterface plane.4.2 Interlock Trip  Conditions that trip the interlockmust be defined by the module supplier. (See SectionR1-1.)4.3 Interlock Logic  The interlock is to consist oftwo normally open relays and associated actuationcircuitry in each module. (See Section R1-2.)4.3.1 First Relay  One relay enables opening of theisolation valve of the attached module. Contact closureindicates a safe condition, enabling valve opening.Contact opening disables valve opening if the valve isclosed. Contact opening does not cause the valve toclose if the valve is open. (See Section R1-3.)4.3.2 Second Relay  The other relay enables closureof the isolation valve of the attached module. Contactclosure indicates a safe condition, enabling valveclosure. Contact opening disables valve closure if thevalve is open. Contact opening does not cause the valveto open if the valve is closed.4.3.3 Monitoring  Situations can arise where themodule A interlock inhibits an operation of the valve onmodule B, when that valve is already in the inhibitedcondition. This potential conflict must be detected andresolved within module B. (See Section R1-3.)4.4 Contact Rating  The relay contacts shall be ratedfor a minimum of 1 A at 24 VDC.4.5 Wiring  Copper wire used in the interlock circuitshall be 0.82 mm2 cross section (18 AWG) or larger.4.6 Interlock Connectors  Metal shell bayonet-typeconnectors are specified per MIL-C-26500E as follows:MS24265R18B11SN panel mounted receptacles oneach of the modules and MS24266R18B11PN plugsterminating each end of the cable which interconnectsthe interlock receptacles of two connected modules.4.7 Interlock Connector Pinouts4.7.1 Receptacle  Pins 2 and 3 of the receptacle areconnected across the contacts of the relay specified in

SEMI E24-92 © SEMI 1992, 20043 RELATED INFORMATION 1NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E24 but was reapproved for publication by fullletter ballot procedures on February 28, 1999. R1-1 Interlock SituationsR1-1.1 Examples are given below, for the differenttypes of modules, of situations in which it might beconsidered hazardous for a connected module tooperate its isolation valve. Note that some of theseconditions prevent opening and others prevent closingof the valves. (See Section 4.1.). Module types aredefined in SEMI E21. SEMI S2 provides guidance indefining potential safety hazards. It is common practiceto detect valve positions and so verify operation, butthis is not an interface matter.R1-1.2 Transport Module Examples  The transportmodule end effector (see SEMI E22) is extendedbeyond the interface plane. The connected moduleshould not close its isolation valve, as such an operationcould damage the end effector.R1-1.2.1 The transport module is not at an acceptabletransfer pressure. Opening the isolation valve of theconnected module could result in damage to the valveor wafer.R1-1.3 Process Module Examples  The transportmodule end effector exclusion volume (see SEMI E22)is obstructed. The transport module should not open itsisolation valve and attempt to extend its end effector.R1-1.3.1 The process module is not at an acceptabletransfer pressure. For instance, the module may be atatmospheric pressure for preventive maintenance. Thetransport module should not open its isolation valve.R1-1.3.2 An unsafe partial pressure of a hazardous gasexists in the process module. The transport moduleshould not attempt to open its isolation valve. R1-1.4 Cassette Module Example  The cassette port(loading door) is open, indicating the possibility of aperson's hand in the cassette module. The transportmodule should not operate its isolation valve to avoidthe possibility of injury to personnel. R1-2 Illustration of LogicR1-2.1 The interlock logic is illustrated in Figure A1and described in Section 4.2. In the figure, the contactsin module B are closed, enabling operation of theisolation valve controlled by module A, while one ofthe contacts in module A is open, preventing closure ofthe isolation valve controlled by module B. R1-3 Interlock ExampleR1-3.1 This example elucidates some of the interlocklogic described in Section 4.2. In the case describedhere, the Transport Module (TM) end effector isextended into a Process Module (PM), which isequipped with an isolation valve. This valve is inhibitedfrom closing by the interlock in the TM.R1-3.2 A situation arises in the PM which results in itsinterlock inhibiting the opening of the isolation valve(which is already open) on the TM. As specified inSection 4.3.3, the TM detects the interlock change andimmediately withdraws its end effector from the PM.The TM interlock enables the closure of the PMisolation valve (which the PM may do if that is theappropriate response to the situation) and the TM canclose its isolation valve.

Current editionreapproved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004. Initially available atwww.semi.org September 2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published in 1992; lastpublished June 1999.Minor editorial changes were made to this document to conform to editorial guidelines.NOTICE: This document was balloted and approvedfor withdrawal in 2004. 1 Introduction1.1 Scope  This guideline specifies an envelopewithin which a cluster tool module is situated. Entryand exit locations through the envelope and connectionlocations to the module for utilities and facility servicesare recommended.1.2 Purpose  The purpose of the cluster tool moduleaccess guideline is to provide assistance in the place-ment of utilities and facility services to cluster toolmodules in order to improve access for maintenanceand service and to simplify cluster tool installation.1.3 Impact  This guideline recommends that equip-ment designs limit the placement of utility lines andfacility services to specific portions of the moduleenvelope.1.4 Exceptions  Local safety regulations must alwaystake precedence over this guideline. Local conditionsmay justify exceptions to this guideline.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 2 Referenced Documents2.1 SEMI DocumentsSEMI E20  Cluster Tool Module Interface: ElectricalPower and Emergency Off StandardSEMI E21  Cluster Tool Module Interface:Mechanical Interface and Wafer Transport StandardSEMI E24  Cluster Tool Module Interface: IsolationValve Interlocks StandardSEMI S2  Safety Guidelines for SemiconductorManufacturing Equipment NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 3 Module Envelope3.1 For the purpose of this guideline, the module enve-lope is taken to be a set of six surfaces that completelyencloses a module. Individual module envelopes maycontact but not penetrate adjacent module envelopes.The six surfaces are the inboard and outboard planes,the two sides, the bottom and the top.3.2 The inboard plane is the interface plane between atransport module and any other module as defined inSEMI E21; thus, a transport module possesses multipleinboard planes. The outboard surface is parallel to theinterface plane and normally coincides with that part ofthe module which is farthest from the interface plane.Each side of the module envelope consists of severalvertical planes. The bottom surface generally coincideswith the floor, and the top is a horizontal plane that con-tains the highest point of the module.3.3 In the sections that follow, the distinction betweenthe physical module and the space reserved for themodule within the envelope must be kept in mind. Sec-tion 4 refers to where utility lines penetrate the enve-lope, and Section 5 refers to constraints on where theselines connect to the physical module. 4 Allocation of Module Envelope Surfaces4.1 The allocation of surfaces is subject to the need foraccess to the interface plane, module movement, main-tenance access space, and protection of module compo-nents (particularly electrical components) from liquidleaks.4.2 Inboard Plane  To allow access to the isolationvalve(s), no utilities or facility services should be rout-ed through the inboard surface close to the valveboundary. ( See SEMI E21) The inboard surface is pre-ferred for intra-tool communications, EMO (see SEMIE20) and the interlock interface between the transportmodule and the attached modules. (See SEMI E24.)

SEMI E25-92 © SEMI 1992, 2004 2 4.3 Outboard Plane  The outboard surface should belimited to non-rigid lines. To minimize potentialmechanical damage, chemical utilities should not enterthrough the lower half of this surface.4.4 Sides  In order to facilitate maintenance access,utilities and facility services should not penetrate themodule envelope sides.4.5 Top Surface  The top surface is preferred forpower, exhaust, process gases and make-up air.Communications and electronic control harnesses couldalso enter through this surface.4.6 Bottom Surface  The bottom surface is preferredfor vacuum lines and all liquid supplies, returns anddrains. The location of all lines should not restrict theremoval of the module. 5 Module Considerations5.1 The locations of utility and facility lines andconnections to the module, which is located within themodule envelope, are given below.5.2 Exhaust, Vacuum and Make-up Air  The size ofpiping for exhaust, vacuum and make-up air suggeststhat the module sides are undesirable locations forconnections.5.3 Maintenance Access  Utility and facility linesand connections to the module sides should not com-promise maintenance access to the module. Connect-ions should be located above or below areas requiringperiodic maintenance access.5.4 Liquids  Liquid supply connections to themodule sides should be as low as practical.5.5 Electrical Components  Electrical componentsthat need to be accessible for maintenance while energized should not be located at the sides of themodule. (See SEMI S2.)5.6 Remote Equipment  For ease of maintenanceaccess, some pieces of equipment (for example, coolantchiller and RF power supplies) may be located outsidethe module envelope. In such cases, the lines andconnections between the remote equipment and themodule should follow this guideline. 6 Examples6.1 The relationship between the location of specificutility and facility lines entering the module envelopeand their subsequent routing and connection to themodule within the module envelope is illustrated by thefollowing examples.6.2 Liquid Connections  Two suggested methods ofproviding liquid connections are shown in Figures 1and 2. The liquid lines enter through the bottom of themodule envelope (see Section 4.5) then connect toeither the side of the module or the bottom of themodule (see Section 5.3).6.3 Gas Connections  Two suggested methods ofproviding gas connections are shown in Figure 2. Thegas lines pass through the top of the module envelope(see Section 4.4), and then connect to the module eitherat the top or at the side.6.4 Exhaust and/or Make-Up Air  Two suggestedmethods of providing exhaust and/or make-up airconnections are shown in Figure 2. The exhaust linepasses through the top of the module envelope (seeSection 4.4) and then connects to the module at or nearthe top. Exhaust and make-up air connections areflanged in Figure 2.
