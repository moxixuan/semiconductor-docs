Values ofthese variables will be available to the host throughcollection event reports and host status queries.7.2 Requirements7.2.1 All generic variable data items defined in GEMare required by all PSEM equipment. Any supplier-defined variables shall be documented in the sameformat used by this document. The following minimuminformation is required: Class: Format: Description: . 7.3 Data Types7.3.1 Equipment Constants (ECVs) can be changed bythe host using S2F15. The operator may be able tochange some values, but the equipment does not changethe values on its own. The value of an equipmentconstant may be queried by the host at any time, usingthe S2F13/14 transaction. They reside in non-volatile memory of the equipment. Equipment constants remainin effect until they are overwritten either by manualentry or by a NEW EQUIPMENT CONSTANT SEND.Equipment constants have various uses in PSEM,including the following: Equipment offsets that match the performance ofseveral pieces of equipment that would otherwiseperform differently due to inherent manufacturingdifferences. Examples are home values and motionaxis scaling factors. Setting the configuration of the equipment to allowfor different material specifications, equipmentoptions, material flows, frequency of automaticfunctions, etc. Examples are yield check frequency. Managing optional machine features. Examples areconstants that tell the system whether optionalfeatures such as automated media stackers arepresent and control the configuration and functionof these optional subsystems when they arepresent. 7.3.2 Status Variables (SVs) are val id at all times. ASV may not be changed by the host but may be changedby the equipment or operator. The value of statusvariables may be queried by the host at anytime usingthe S1,F3/4 or S6,F19/20 transactions. DVVALs arevariables that are valid only upon the occurrence ofspecific collection events. An attempt to read a datavariable at the wrong time will not generate an error,but the data reported may not have relevant meaning."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 6 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E91-0600 \xa9 SEMI 1999, 200011 7.4 Data Item Variable TableTable 7 Data Item Variable Table Variable Name Description Class Format CommentsStopUnit Constant which specifies separation of stopoperation in probing.ECV U1 0=Unit of Die1=Unit of Wafer2=Unit of Cassette3=Unit of LotEventJobID Prober Job ID which occurs Prober Job statetransition.DVVAL A","[","30","]"," Valid when Prober Job statetransition occurs.EventJobState Current state of Prober Job whose state changed.

The prober defines PPID with structure class name/class name/processprogram record name. The number of PPID digits is defined by an equipment supplier. If the number of the digitsis less than a default value, left-justify and fill in space after PPID. Do not use space at some midpoint in PPID. Atpresent, the prober practically uses the structure class name and class name as shown in the table given below.Table 9 How to Operate Class Name and Structural Class Name Classification Operation RemarksStructural class name Class name indicating major classification of process program record.

These services provide capabilities for the host to coordinate processing and disposition of materials onproduction equipment. 2 Scope2.1 This specification may be applied to equipment that is compliant to SEMI E30 (GEM). However, it is alsointended that this standard will be useful for future generation equipment interfaces that supercede SEMI E30, suchas SEMI E53.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This standard presents a model of the ControlJob. The model delineates the services (messages) and behaviorof the ControlJob. The model is protocol independent. Thus, an ancillary standard must be selected in order toprovide a complete implementation.3.2 This standard should not be applied to non-production equipment, such as, material transport systems orfacilities (environmental) controllers.3.3 This specification applies to equipment for which the atomic unit of material is the same for all input and outputcarriers on the equipment. It may not apply to equipment which would perform operations such as slicing orassembly that would require or result in different input and output material objects. This specification may notapply to equipment or equipment configurations where the equipment does not handle carriers, as in the case of astepper or scanner in a linked photolithography cell. 4 Referenced Standards and Documents4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E30  Generic Model for Communications and Control of Manufacturing Equipment (GEM)SEMI E39  Object Services Standard: Concepts, Behavior, and ServicesSEMI E40  Standard for Processing ManagementSEMI E53  Event ReportingNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 control job  defines a unit of work on equipment for one or more carriers.

When describing something in the general (like cities) lower case is used, but when a specificentity is of interest (New York City), then first letters are capitalized.6.2 State Model Methodology6.2.1 This document uses the Harel state chart convention for describing dynamic operation of defined objects. Theoutline of this convention is described in an attachment of SEMI E30. The official definition of this convention isdescribed in State Charts: A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems written by D. Harel in Science of ComputerProgramming 8, 1987. 1 6.2.2 The Harel convention does not have the concept of state models of creation and extinction for expressinga temporary entity. The job described in this document is such an entity, and a copy of the same state model isused for an independent job newly created. In this document, a circle with a black circle inside is used forexpressing extinction of an entity. A filled, black circle denotes the entry to the state model (the entity creation).6.2.3 Transition tables are provided in conjunction with the state diagrams to explicitly describe the nature of eachstate transition. A transition table contains columns for Transition number, Previous State, Trigger, New State,Actions, and Comments. The trigger (column 3) for the transition occurs while in the previous state. Theactions (column 5) includes a combination of:1) Actions taken upon exit of the previous state.2) Actions taken upon entry of the new state.3) Actions taken which are most closely associated with the transition.6.2.3.1 No differentiation is made between these cases. 1 Elsevier Science, P.O.

Astate model consists of a state model diagram, state definitions, and a state transition table. When using collectionevents, all state transitions in this standard, unless otherwise specified, shall correspond to collection events.6.2.5 A state model represents the hosts view of the equipment, and does not necessarily describe the internalequipment operation. When using collection events, all Control Job Management state model transitions shall bemapped sequentially into the appropriate internal equipment collection events that satisfy the requirements of thosetransitions. In certain implementations, the equipment may enter a state and have already satisfied all of theconditions required by the Control Job Management state models for transition to another state. In the case, theequipment makes the required transition without any additional actions in this situation. Num Previous State Trigger New State Actions Comments 6.3 Service Message Representation6.3.1 Services are functions or methods that may be provided by either the equipment or the host. A servicemessage may be either a request message, which always requires a response, or a notification message, that does notrequire a response.6.3.2 Service Definition6.3.2.1 A service definition table defines the specific set of messages for a given service resource, as shown in thefollowing table: Message Service Name Type Description 6.3.2.2 Type can be either N = Notification or R = Request & Response.6.3.2.3 Notification type messages are initiated by the service provider (e.g., the equipment) and the provider doesnot expect to get a response from the service user. Request messages are initiated by a service user (e.g., the host).Request messages ask for data or an activity from the provider. Request messages expect a specific responsemessage (no presumption on the message content).6.3.3 Service Parameter Dictionary6.3.3.1 A service parameter dictionary table defines the description, format and its possible value for parametersused by services, as shown in the following table: Parameter Name Description Format: Possible Value 6.3.3.2 A row is provided in the table for each parameter of a service.6.3.4 Service Message Definition6.3.4.1 A service message definition table defines the parameters used in a service, as shown in the following table: Parameter Req/Ind Res/Cnf Comment 6.3.4.2 The columns labeled REQ/IND and RSP/CNF link the parameters to the direction of the message.

Whether a value is given may becompletely optional or may depend on the value of the other parameter.U User-Defined Parameter.- The parameter is not used.= (For response only) Indicates that the value of this parameter in the response must match that in the primary (if defined). 7 Overview7.1 This section provides an overview of the control job functionality. It does not contain the specifications whichdefine that functionality.7.1.1 Control jobs provide a supervisory level of control for process jobs on material processing equipment. Theycan be used to reduce the amount of host level interaction required for material processing. A factory host isprovided with methods for instructing the equipment to provide only significant factory level events, such as, acarrier complete. The ControlJob also supplies methods for the disposition of material after processing.7.2 User Requirements7.2.1 To handle the complexity required for manufacturing, equipment must support the ability to coordinate itsprocessing services with the factorys needs. The ControlJob provides the services that the factory needs toaccomplish this coordination. The requirements that the ControlJob satisfies include: (1) a method by which theequipment coordinates related work, for instance, all process jobs associated with a carrier, and (2) a method bywhich the equipment can be informed of material destination after processing. The ControlJob is not a type ofprocess job. It is not responsible for the coordination of the processing resource and the material to be processed.7.2.2 Initiate and Monitor Process Jobs7.2.2.1 ControlJobs are queued. ProcessJobs are not queued by equipment that supports control jobs, rather theyare pooled waiting to be scheduled by their respective ControlJob. The ControlJob specifies the order for processjobs. The equipment follows that order as the equipments resources become available (and when material isavailable).7.3 Supplier Requirements7.3.1 Management of Process Materials7.3.1.1 Suppliers need to implement an operational model for managing material and processing in a mannerconsistent with factory expectations. For instance, the equipment must know when it is finished with a carrier sothat it can either allow or signal the factory for the removal of the carrier. This standard provides mechanisms tomeet this requirement. While the model implies some implementation it is only the external events that are requiredby this standard.7.3.2 Control Job Events7.3.2.1 Control jobs supply information to host systems as either responses to request messages or as events whichare sent to the host. Typically the equipment can implement the event mechanisms either in GEM (SEMI E30) orthe Event Reporting standard (SEMI E53).7.3.2.2 All state transitions defined for state models in this document must be able to be reported by separatecollection events as defined in 6.2, State Model Methodology. The state model is the Control Job State Model(Figure 2). The data required for each state model transition event is defined per the following. This data is theminimum required per event. The host may assign other variable, as applicable, from 13, Variable Data, of thisdocument, or from other equipment variable data.7.3.2.3 The following data is required to be available for the Control Job State Model transition collection events:CtrlJobID"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 22 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E94-0705 \xa9 SEMI 2000, 20055 7.4 Operational Descriptions7.4.1 The ProcessJob as referenced in the specification of the control job model is the SEMI E40 process job.Within a ProcessJob the material processing order is managed by the equipment. For some equipment types, theuser may be able to configure the material processing order. If available, this feature shall be fully documented bythe supplier (see SEMI E40).7.4.2 To support a simpler interface for single substrate processing, it is suggested to use the PRJobMultiCreate (seeSEMI E40) service.7.4.3 The use of control jobs restricts some SEMI E40 functionality. In particular, the equipments queuemanagement functionality for process jobs is super-seded by the job order as defined in the control job.7.4.4 The relationship between control jobs and process jobs varies by equipment type. The equipment suppliershould document this relationship. In general aborting or stopping a process job does not stop or abort the controljob. Equipment is responsible to disposition material correctly depending on how a process job ends. In the case ofequipment types that always have a one to one relationship between a control job and a process job it may beconvenient for a process job abort or stop to automatically abort the respective control job. In the same sense, if acontrol job specifies more than one process job, it may be convenient for an abort or stop of all process jobs toautomatically abort or stop the respective control job. 8 ControlJob Object Model8.1 This specification only standardizes the ControlJob objects interface. The other objects provide a context forthe ControlJob interface. Since only the interface is standardized, it is not a requirement for equipment toimplement a control job object, it is only required that the equipment provide an external interface that provides theservices and behavior defined for the ControlJob.8.2 Material to Job Linkage8.2.1 The equipment has relationships with many other components not illustrated in Figure 1. In particular, fromits knowledge based on substrate and carrier tracking capabilities, the equipment shall connect the process jobmaterial list to the materials in the carriers that it has. It is the responsibility of the factory host to make sure that thedescription or identifiers of material contained in carriers can be mapped to the material identifiers in the process jobdefinition.8.3 Control Jobs and Carriers8.3.1 A control job may specify work for several carriers. The supplier shall document the behavior of theequipment in the case where a carrier is specified for use in more than one control job.8.4 Attribute Definitions8.4.1 The attributes in Table 1 shall be accessible using the Object Services standard (SEMI E39). Object servicesis a set of messages which may be required of any service provider which is modeled by objects. An object modelfor a service provides a consistent naming convention for exchanging information between the service provider anduser. Object services implementations shall be consistent with the services object and state models. For instance, ifan attribute can only be modified in a certain state, then a request to set that attribute when the model is in the wrongstate shall be rejected (fail). ControlJob Attributes shall be modifiable if and only if the ControlJob is not in eitherthe EXECUTING or COMPLETED states by using OSS to change them (see 14.3.1)."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 23 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E94-0705 \xa9 SEMI 2000, 2005 6 ControlJob Carrier ProcessJob(SEMI E40) Substrate uses 1..","*"," specifies Equipment manages 0..","*","0..","*"," 0..","*"," 0..","*"," 0..","*"," Material 1..","*"," manages specifies holds 0..1 Figure 1ControlJob Object Model Table 1 ControlJob Attributes Name Definition Rqmt Access FormObjID Host defined identifier of the control job.

For a wafer carrier the SubstrateLocation is a slot number.Numeric 8.4.3 ControlRule8.4.3.1 For equipment that supports this attribute (field), the host sets this in order to achieve better host processingcontrol capabilities. For example, the host may have previously measured characteristics of the material to beprocessed. A standard recipe is used based on the product and process step, but based on the measuredcharacteristics, the application of the recipe is biased by the specified rule and the value that is passed to the rule(RuleValue). However, use of ControlRule should not be considered to be limited to only this type of application.8.4.4 DataCollectionPlan8.4.4.1 The DataCollectionPlan is a name given by the host to associate data collection activities to a specificcontrol job. In general, it provides a way for the equip-ment to then inform and coordinate with the host to receivedata collection requests. A DataCollectionPlan is generic and will be applied to many control jobs. The variableitself, DataCollectionPlan, will hold no significance for the equipment. It is simply a label the equipment reportsback when requested by the host. Normally, the host upon receiving the ControlJob START event would includeDataCollectionPlan as a data variable to be reported. The host then knows that the time is appropriate to set upvarious trace reports and event reports on the equipment. Potentially, all jobs that specify the same product type andprocess capability could specify the same DataCollectionPlan.8.4.5 OutputRule8.4.5.1 This attribute can only be supported by equipment that has some means to determine the status of materialthat it has processed. For equipment with that ability, the rule will usually take the form of a list of name valuepairs. The names will be material status and the values will be measurement thresholds that correspond to the statuscategory (such as, Good, Reject, Rework, etc.). Substrate (material) status changes should be recorded in substratehistories created by the equipment.8.4.5.2 Equipment which also supports the MtrlOutbyStatus shall use the status determined by the OutputRule toplace substrates at the Destination associated with MaterialStatus.8.4.6 PauseEvent8.4.6.1 For equipment which can support it, this attribute contains a list of equipment events, specified by the host,at which the host expects the equipment to PAUSE the ControlJob. Equipment suppliers shall document any eventsthat can be used for the pausing of control jobs. Pausing a control job causes it to stop initiating process jobs. Thehost might use this to stop processing after one or more process jobs has started in order to await results beforeprocessing the rest of the material in the control job.8.4.7 ProcessOrderMgmt8.4.7.1 This is an enumerated attribute that defines the order in which processing will occur.

The ControlJob transitions to this state only if the StartMethod is set to FALSE (UserStart) and materialshave arrived.9.2.4 EXECUTING  In this state, each process job in the ProcessingCtrlSpec is initiated in order, based on thevalue of the ControlJobs ProcessOrderMgmt attribute as required resources become available and material for thejob has been verified. Process jobs that have been initiated but that are WAITINGFORSTART or PAUSED shallblock the availability of the resources that they require (see SEMI E40).NOTE 1: Process jobs that have blocked available resources shall cause the ControlJob to stop initiating subsequent process jobsthat use those resources.9.2.5 PAUSED  When the ControlJob is paused it shall not commence the initiation of any more Process jobs. Inthis state, Process jobs that have not entered the PROCESSING state can be modified. Various attributes of theControlJob can also be modified. This is equipment specific and shall be documented by the equipment supplier.9.2.6 COMPLETED  A control job enters this state once all of its process jobs have been completed, stopped oraborted.Table 3 ControlJob State Transition TableNum Previous State Trigger New State Actions Comments1 (No state) Receive Create commandfrom host or operator throughoperator console.

(No state) Equipment should performthis function automaticallyfor COMPLETED jobs. 10 Control Job Queue Model10.1 The Queuing mechanism for control jobs will generally operate under FIFO (First in- First Out) constraints.The commands used to monitor queue status and prevent deadlock conditions are specified here.10.2 Queue Integrity10.2.1 To maintain queue integrity, only one operation shall be performed at any given time (e.g., the Createrequest shall be rejected by the equipment if the CJHOQ service is being processed). The Queue is defined to belocked while it is performing an operation (and refusing any further operation until completion of the currentoperation).10.3 Head of Queue Service10.3.1 The Head of Queue service (CJHOQ) shall operate under the following rules:1) All control jobs positioned between the specified control job and the head of the queue (including the jobcurrently positioned at the head) will be moved back one position. The specified control job will then be movedinto the head of queue position.2) When the CJHOQ command is invoked, the queue will be locked to maintain integrity.3) In the case where only one control job exists in the queue, the command will perform no action on the queue.10.4 DeadLocks10.4.1 The Head of Queue service (CJHOQ) requests a specific control job to be set as the next control job to berun. In order to prevent deadlock when the job at Head of Queue and the job in the SELECTED state are both"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 29 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E94-0705 \xa9 SEMI 2000, 2005 12 awaiting material delivery, the CJHOQ command may be used to move a different job to the head of the queueposition. The potential dead lock is then broken by issuing the DE-SELECT service request.10.5 Utilization of Queue for Control Job Priority Management10.5.1 Similar to Deadlock, certain cases may arise where a job at the head of the queue cannot be selected due to alack of processing resources. In this case, DE-SELECT command shall be rejected and consequently a series of DE-SELECT and CJHOQ commands may be issued in an attempt to find a job which can transition to SELECTEDstate.10.5.2 To force a hot job to be the next job run, it could be necessary to send the CJStop message to theSELECTED job. This case only happens when the job at the head of the queue (the hot job) does not yet haveresources available.NOTE 2: Most equipment where this is possible can support parallel execution of Control Jobs. Management of the queue(s) inthis case is currently beyond the scope of this standard.10.6 Space in the Queue10.6.1 The QueueAvailableSpace variable data item is used to query the number of control job openings within thequeue. The QueueAvailableSpace shall function according to the following rules:1) This variable can only be guaranteed valid when no other operations are being performed simultan-eously onthe queue. For example, dont request this variable while a Create control job command is being processed bythe equipment.2) This variable shall be incremented whenever a control job in the queue is de-queued. That is, when a Cancel,Abort, or Stop command has been received and completed while the control job is queued. It should alsobe incremented when the SELECTED state is entered by a control job. However, if this transition occurs as aresult of the Deselect command (at least one job in queue, and a control job in the SELECTED state), nochange should be made to the variable value.3) This variable should be decremented whenever a control job joins the queue. That is, when a Cre-atecommand is received and accepted. It should also be decremented if a Deselect command is issued on acontrol job in the SELECTED state and no other jobs currently reside in the queue.4) The equipment should reject the Create command when this variable is equal to zero.10.7 Getting a List of Queued Jobs10.7.1 The QueuedCJobs Variable Data Item is used to query the names of the control jobs currently residing in thequeue. It lists items starting at the head of the queue.10.7.2 The QueuedCJobs Variable Data Item shall function according to the following rules:1) This variable can only be guaranteed valid when no other operations are being performed simultan-eously onthe queue.2) This variable list will be modified whenever a suc-cessful Create command is received. Addition-ally,Cancel, Abort, and Stop commands issued on control jobs residing in the queue will modify this variablelist. Any use of the Deselect command will also modify the variable list.11 Properties for Carriers11.1 Compliance to Control Job Management requires that the equipment track the status of individual carriers. Inparticular, the factory needs to know the status of carriers with respect to control jobs. Carriers may have variousproperties that are beyond the scope of this standard. However, there are specific properties that are needed forControl Jobs.11.2 Carrier Verification11.2.1 The equipment needs to know when a carrier has been verified as proper. Only process jobs associated withthe carrier that has been verified shall be initiated by a control job. Depending on the equipments capabilities,verification may include verification by an equipment read of the carriers ID (identification) and the reading of thesubstrate (e.g., wafer) slot map. The ControlJob determines if the carrier is verified by checking the carriers"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 30 --",">"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E94-0705 \xa9 SEMI 2000, 200513 attributes that indicate the level to which a carrier has been verified. This section is reserved for furtherspecification of this requirement.11.3 Carrier Completion for Control Jobs11.3.1 A carrier that has been loaded onto the equipment may go through three stages: first, it is in the notaccessed stage until it is accessed by a control job. When the carrier is at the substrate port and unloading of thesubstrates within the carrier begins, the carrier enters the in access stage. Once it enters this stage, it remains inthis stage until all material has been returned to the carrier, no active control job exists that is using it and no controljobs in the queue exist that reference it. The equipment shall provide a property of the carrier that shows the currentstage of all carriers. The equipment shall provide a CarrierComplete or CarrierStopped event for each change instage. The event when the carrier enters the in access stage informs the host that the carrier may not be removedfrom the equipment. The event when the carrier enters the completed stage informs the host that the carrier maybe removed. 12 Requirements - Service Definitions12.1 Service DefinitionsTable 4 Service Definitions Table Message Service Name Type DescriptionCJStart R To start a ControlJob.CJPause R To request a ControlJob to pause.CJResume R To request a PAUSED ControlJob to go to the EXECUTING state.CJCancel R To request a ControlJob to be removed from the queue.CJDeselect R To request a ControlJob to be deselected; it will no longer be the next job to run.CJStop R To request a ControlJob to stop.

The order is based on the queue. AControlJob shall not issue a complete event (message) until all substrates have been placed in destination carriers.However, in many cases equipment must support multiple control jobs running at once; in order to support thefactory requirement for equipment productivity. This will be particularly true for multi-module equipment. Thenext ControlJob in the queue shall start as soon as possible after processing has begun for the last ProcessJob in theprevious ControlJobs processing control specification.14.2 Parallel Execution of Control Job14.2.1 Some equipment may be able to support parallel execution of control jobs. The supplier must fullydocument this behavior and any additional services needed to manage it.14.3 Modifying Control Jobs14.3.1 Control jobs shall be modifiable if and only if they are not in either the EXECUTING or COMPLETEDstates.

Information about the equipments set-up is important tothe factory in determining the best material routing. The SetupName variable defined in this standard is set by thehost after host directed processing or changes to equipment constants.

It is intended that the use of other types ofdisplay objects (choose lists, data display and data entryfields, scroll-bars, etc.) is specifically allowed, and theiruse is at the discretion of the implementers.5.2.1.1 There are two types of display objects;selectable and non-selectable. Some are selectable bythe user to initiate or execute an action. Non-selectablegraphics and user interface elements (such as pipes andtext field labels, respectively) are read only, and noaction is initiated or executed.5.2.2 Buttons5.2.2.1 Button Size Mandatory5.2.2.1.1 When a touchscreen device is used, buttonsizes must be large enough to ensure selection on thetargeted display.5.2.2.2 Button Dimensions Recommended5.2.2.2.1 It is recommended that buttons shall have aminimum dimension of approximately 1.5 cm on theshortest side. If a smaller size is used, the spacebetween buttons must be increased to avoid selectionerrors. For installations where a keyboard and a mouse,light pen or other pointing device is available, buttonsizes in the navigation panel and the command panelmay be made somewhat smaller (approximately 11.25cm), and the size of the information panel increasedproportionally.5.2.2.3 Button Behavior Mandatory5.2.2.3.1 One type of button behavior is momentary;that is, user selection of a button causes a brief displayof the down (selected) state of the button, followedimmediately by a display of the up (unselected) state.The other button behavior is two-state; the buttonremains in the down state after user selection. User re-selection of the button, and/or selection of anotherbutton, and/or selection of another display objectrestores the display of the up state. In some cases, thesoftware will control the display of the down state orrestore the up state, without direct user interaction.5.2.2.3.2 For 2-D buttons, the down state shall beindicated by hatching, cross-hatching, or otherwisetexturing the button in such a manner that does notobscure the button label.5.2.2.4 Button Text Mandatory5.2.2.4.1 Text for all button labels shall have the firstletter of words capitalized unless it is an article or pre- position not occurring at the beginning or end of thelabel, or unless the words conventional usage is notcapitalized. Button labels that are all capital letters areharder to read than mixed case labels. Additionally, textin all capitals appears larger, and the user may attachmore importance to the button than necessary simplybecause the label is visually distracting.5.2.3 Saliences Conditional5.2.3.1 Saliences, colored, textured, or both shall bedisplayed around buttons and other display objects toindicate their condition, which may include caution,alarm, user attention required or requested, processing,unfinished task notification, and other conditions.5.2.3.2 A salience is displayed to draw the usersattention to a display object when its condition is notnormal or OK (in this case, the absence of a displayedsalience shall indicate a normal or OK condition), orwhen the salience provides information that benefits theuser in the performance of tasks or the monitoring ofequipment functions and operations.5.2.3.3 A salience shall not hide the display object itsurrounds. Saliences shall not be used to indicate thestate (open, closed, on, off, etc.) of display objects.5.2.3.4 On color displays, alarm saliences shall appearbright red, caution saliences shall appear bright yellow,and processing and unfinished task saliences shallappear medium blue. User attention required orrequested saliences, (for example, Ready to Load, orReady to Unload) shall appear medium green.5.2.4 Dialog Boxes Description5.2.4.1 Dialog boxes are secondary windows used todisplay supplemental information, solicit informationfrom the user, or report errors.5.2.4.2 Dialog boxes are used to provide additionalinformation to the user; to display detailed informationnot shown on the information panel for controlling thesystem, and to display detailed information formonitoring system operation.5.2.5 Dialog Boxes Mandatory5.2.5.1 Dialog boxes (which are always temporary) aredisplayed in response to some action initiated by theuser. When displayed, a dialog box shall overlay aportion of the information panel, and shall not obscurethe title panel. If invoked by user selection of a displayobject on the information or command panels, all thedisplay objects on those two panels shall be disableduntil the dialog box is dismissed. The title andnavigation panels remain enabled.

The title bar text reflects the command or thenature of the event that invoked the dialog box. Dialogbox window control buttons are centered on the widthof the dialog box, with any other buttons (Apply, Log-out, etc.) right-aligned and visually separated from thewindow control buttons. If the underlying operatingsystem will not allow this alignment, then it is allowedthat other alignments may be used, but only if the align-ment is consistent across all dialog boxes.5.2.5.2.1 User selection of a dialog box control buttoncontrols the dismissal of the dialog box and, whenapplicable, controls whether the user accepts or rejectsinformation or choices displayed, or desires no actionbe performed.5.2.5.2.1.1 An OK dialog box control button, whenselected by the user, indicates acceptance of anychoices or user inputs made, if any, and causes thedismissal of the dialog box. If no choices or user inputswere made, selecting this button indicates acceptance ofany default values displayed. If user choices or inputsare required, this button shall be disabled until thechoices or inputs are made.5.2.5.2.1.2 A Cancel dialog box control button, whenselected by the user, indicates no action should betaken, causes the dismissal of the dialog box, andreturns the user to the state that existed prior to theinvocation of the dialog box.5.2.5.2.1.3 A Yes dialog box control button isdisplayed when the dialog box message is in the formof a question.

User selection indicates no action shouldbe taken, causes the dismissal of the dialog box, andreturns the user to the state that existed prior to theinvocation of the dialog box.5.2.5.2.1.5 A Close dialog box control button isdisplayed (often as the only dialog box control button)when the dialog box message contains only informationand does not require the user to make or accept choices,and shall be used instead of an OK dialog box controlbutton in this case. The Close dialog box controlbutton shall also be used instead of a Cancel dialogbox control button when the user cannot be returned tothe state that existed prior to the invocation of thedialog box. User selection indicates no action should betaken and causes the dismissal of the dialog box. 5.2.5.2.1.6 An Apply dialog box control button,when selected by the user, indicates acceptance of anychoices or user inputs made, if any, but does notdismiss the dialog box. This button shall be disableduntil one or more user choices or inputs are made. Afteruser selection of this button, it shall be disabled untiladditional choices or user inputs are made, if any.5.2.5.3 Dialog boxes may not be resized or moved, butmay display a button equivalent to the Cancel button inthe title bar.

The message text is located to the right of the icon. It isrecommended that icons from the underlying operatingsystem be used to represent the message type asfollows: Information in the form of a simple message Progress, informing the user of an ongoing process Attention, alerting the user of possible danger, orinability to execute a command, or requestingconfirmation (either as a statement or as aquestion) Error, informing the user of danger or inability toexecute a command (if effect is severe)5.2.8.2 Note that most style guides no longerrecommend the use of a question mark icon when themessage is phrased as a question, as its meaning couldbe ambiguous in some cases. The attention icon shouldbe used instead.5.2.8.3 The first two message types use the Closewindow control button. The second two use OK andCancel, or Yes and No (and sometimes Cancel) if themessage is phrased as a question.

Jobs System Recipes Setup (Future) Alarms Help InformationPanel FunctionalAreas Figure 5Basic Network Navigational Model 5.3.4 Network Navigation Model with Sub-navigation Conditional5.3.4.1 While maintaining the same basic structure, this navigation model supports multiple views within functionalareas on the network. If any functional area has more than one view, all functional areas in the interface shallconsistently use one of the two view sub-navigation methods described below. Lateral transfer between any of theviews within a functional area is supported either by providing a single row of tabs which may be selected to changeviews (Figure 6), or by providing view sub-navigation buttons (Figure 7) in a separate screen area dedicated solelyto sub-navigation. Expansion of detail for each of these views is typically implemented using dialog boxes.5.3.4.2 The grouping of tasks within functional areas reflects the natural flow of information, events, and tasks in away that is familiar to the user and that directly supports the attainment of successful process and equipmentperformance goals. Functional areas are user task oriented, collecting together logically related monitoring andcontrol functions, reducing the need to navigate between views.5.3.4.3 Note that the diagrams are schematic; they show that user selection of a functional area shall display itsassociated information panel. Only one information panel shall be displayed at any time. Similarly, user selection ofa tab or sub-navigation button displays only one of the views available at any time.")))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
