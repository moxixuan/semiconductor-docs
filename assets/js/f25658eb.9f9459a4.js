Required directional changes should beaccomplished by butt-weld elbows or blockcomponents. Tube bends may be used on tubing \u2264 \u03a9inch O.D. and should be formed using manual or CNCbending equipment. CNC tube bending is preferred tomanual tube bending because during manual bendinguniform deformation of the tubing is more difficult tocontrol and reproducibility of bend geometries is muchless than that achieved by bending using CNC methods.An internal mandrel must not be used during bending asit can contaminate and/or damage the internal surface.Recommended minimum bend radii are the following: For inert gas lines, a bend radius (as measuredfrom the tube centerline) as small as 2  tubediameter may be used for 90 degree directionalchanges. For reactive gas lines, a bend radius (as measuredfrom the tube centerline) as small as 5x tubediameter may be used for 90 degree directionalchanges; however, it is recommended thatcorrosion testing be performed to determine if benttubing is suitable in each particular reactive gasapplication.5.3 Components that may need to be removed orreplaced should be installed with metal seal fittings.5.4 Dead volumes should be minimized in the processgas stream. The system internal volume should beminimized.5.5 All potentially pyrophoric or reactive gases shouldhave upstream and downstream purge/vacuumcapability for MFC maintenance. To speed the purgeprocess and allow the system to be evacuated even ifthe MFC is clogged, the design should also have theability to provide vacuum both upstream anddownstream of the MFC. A gas is defined to be reactive if it has a Hazardous Production Material (HPM) ratingof 3 or 4 per SEMI S2.5.6 Inert gases do not need an input for an independentpurge gas. Inert gases can act as their own purge gasand only need to purge in the intended direction offlow. Inert gas lines do not need upstream vacuumcapability or downstream purge capability. To speedthe purge process, the design should have the ability toprovide vacuum downstream of the MFC.5.7 For low pressure equipment, the vacuum path fromthe MFC manifold to the pump should bypass theprocess chamber during purging or maintenance andshould connect directly to the foreline.5.8 For atmospheric pressure equipment, a vacuumVenturi to vent/exhaust method should be required forreactive gases.5.9 Design should include a means of cycle purgingupstream and downstream of removable components orsubassemblies for reactive gases and should include ameans of flow-through purging for all removablecomponents.5.10 Backflow/back pressure protection should beincluded for all purge gases in the system.5.11 All incoming gas lines should have filters.5.12 Any additional filters, located at point of usebefore a process chamber or loadlock, should have ameans of isolation from atmosphere.5.13 Test/sample ports should be located on eachprocess chamber supply line or the designatedpurge/vent line.5.14 For processes requiring additional purification ofprocess gases, purifiers should be included in the gassystem and located upstream of MFCs. The systemshould include a means of purging and removingpurifiers in a safe manner. 6 Materials Guidelines6.1 Stainless Steel6.1.1 Components should be fabricated fromelectropolished 316L stainless steel per SEMI F17, orSEMI F20.6.2 Other Materials6.2.1 Materials for valve seals, diaphragms, gaskets,and O-rings should be chemically compatible with theprocess gas.

This index orlist will facilitate the production and use of digital massflow devices. 2 Scope2.1 The list includes gases, gas mixtures, andvaporizable materials that can be used in mass flowdevices. The list will supplement, not replace, existingDOT/OSHA or other identification systems. For ease ofuse, the list is presented sorted by gas code, gas name,and symbol for gases and vaporizable materials and bycode and mixture percentage for gas mixtures.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use.
