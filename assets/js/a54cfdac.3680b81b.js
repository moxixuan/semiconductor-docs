This  may  happen  even  with  similar  LPPDs  if\ncalibration differences have occurred. Therefore, before\nthe  first  use  the  sensor  should  be  calibrated  by  the\nmanufacturer.   This   calibration   should   be   compliant\nwith or should be reviewed with the following reference\ncalibration  equipment  and  procedure.  This  reference\ncalibration     allows     the     characterization     of     the\nperformance of the LPPD under test. The LPPD should\nbe  recalibrated  at  regular  intervals  and  also  in  case  of\nunusual measurement readings to ensure correct results.\n9. 1.1  The parameters calibrated for LPPDs with sizing\ncapability are:\n\u2022 Sizing calibration,\n\u2022 Resolution,\n\u2022 Zero counting,\n\u2022 Counting efficiency, and\n\u2022 Sensitivity.\n9. 1.2    The  parameters  calibrated  for  LPPDs  with  non-\nsizing capability are:\n\u2022 Zero counting, and\n\u2022 Counting efficiency.\n9. 1.3    Field  calibration  may  not  necessarily  require  the\ncalibration of all parameters performed by calibration at\nthe sensor manufacturers site.\n9. 1.4    Due  to  the  fact  that  different  LPPDs  might  be\nworking  with  different  detection  areas  A\nL\n,  the  number\nof  counts  should  be  printed  out  in  counts  per  mm\n2"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"detection    area.

If  the  velocity  meter  or\nflow  meter  is  mounted  in  front  of  the  probe  inlet  of  the\nreference   particle   counter,   the   device   should   have   no\ninfluence  on  the  particle  size  distribution  measured  by  the\nreference particle counter.\n9. 2.2.10  Calibration Line System\n9. 2.2.10.1  The system consisting of\n\u2022 a device to inject the particles into the zero gas,\n\u2022 a  device  to  mix  the  aerosol  sample  with  the  zero\ngas to obtain uniform particle concentration,\n\u2022 a  device  to  adapt  the  LPPD  into  the  line  (diameter\nD\nL\n),\n\u2022 a  device  to  adapt  the  velocity  meter  or  the  flow\nmeter,\n\u2022 a   device   (diameter   D\nRC\n=   D\nL\n,   same   particle\nconcentration  as  at  the  LPPD)  to  draw  a  defined,\nisokinetic  sample  from  the  line  for  the  reference\nparticle counter (the opening area of the probe inlet\nshould  be  reported  in  the  calibration  report  form),\nand\n\u2022 tubing  connecting  the  devices  with  each  other  and\nwith the fan and filter system.\n9. 2.2.10.2    The  line  system  should  be  smooth,  conduc-\ntive, and electrically grounded to minimize electrostatic\ninteraction of the particles with line walls and the parti-\ncles themselves. The line should be as short and straight\nas possible with no bends with a radius of curvature less\nthan 100 mm. Leak-free connections of the line and all\ndevices should be ensured using appropriate fittings.\n9. 2.2.10.3    Figure  1  illustrates  a  recommended  LPPD\ncalibration system.\nNOTE 9: The distance between the device to adapt the LPPD\nunder  test  and  the  device  for  sample  acquisition  for  the\nreference  particle  counter  should  be  as  short  as  possible  to\nminimize  particle  loss  and  to  ensure  comparable  particle\nconcentrations.\n9. 2.2.11  Reference Particle Counter (RPC)\n9. 2.2.11.1  The reference particle counter is required to\nmeasure  the  actual  concentration  of  the  monodisperse\naerosol  and  the  quality  of  the  zero  gas  inside  the  line.\nTherefore,   the   counting   efficiency   of   the   reference\nparticle  counter  is  defined  as  100%  over  the  range  of\nparticle  sizes  used  in  the  test.  The  resolution  should  be\nbetter  than  10%  at  the  lower  detection  limit  of  the\nLPPD   under   test.   The   values   of   the   measurement\nshould  be  printed  out  in  counts  per  mm\n2\nopening  area\nA\nRC\nof the probe inlet. The sample transit line from the\nprobe inlet and the reference particle counter should be\nas short and as straight as possible. Smooth, conductive,\nand electrically grounded materials should be used.\n9. 2.2.12  Sensor Window Temperature\n9. 2.2.12.1    Some  LPPDs  have  the  capability  to  heat\ntheir sensor windows to avoid coating of the window. A\ndevice  to  measure  and  to  adjust  the  sensor  window\ntemperature  within  the  operating  range  (measurable  to\n5%)  should  be  installed  in  the  calibration  setup.

The    procedure    establishes    the\nvoltage  response  of  the  LPPD  for  these  particles.  The\nreported  size  for  unknown  particles  is  the  same  size  of\nthe monodisperse particle whose voltage response is the\nvoltage pulse produced by the unknown particle (called\nOptical Equivalent Size).\nA2-1.2      If   an   LPPD   is   able   to   detect   all   of   the\ndistribution  (see  counting  efficiency)  generated  by  a\nmonodisperse   aerosol   and   the   size   of   the   particle\nstandard is known, the calibrating of an LPPD without a\nreference  particle  counter  is  possible.  Ideally,  the  data\ncollected   by   the   LPPD   observing   a   monodisperse\naerosol   would   describe   a   Gaussian   particle   size\ndistribution. However, the reported voltage pulse height\ndistribution is often not symmetric. Therefore, the mode\nand  modal  values  of  the  pulse  height  distribution  are\nnot equal. The thresholds for different particle sizes are\nset  as  the  mode  or  median  value  of  the  observed\ndistribution.  The  modal  voltage  method  is  commonly\nused.\nA2-1.3    The  intensity  of  the  scattered  light  detected  by\na photodetector depends on intensity, polarization state,\nand  wavelength  of  the  incident  light  beam,  diameter,\nshape, and refractive index of the particle, as well as on\nthe  geometrical  layout  of  the  collection  optics  and\ndetector.  In  the  particle  size  range  near  the  wavelength\n(0.1\u03bb < d\nP\n<  10\u03bb), large oscillations can be seen in the\nintensity   curve   of   the   light   scattered   by   spherical\nparticles   as   a   function   of   all   these   parameters.\nTherefore, the response curve might not be monotonic.\nParticles  of  more  than  one  size  will  produce  the  same\nvoltage  output  signal.  The  calibration  particles  should\nbe chosen so that their response is not included in such\nreversals of the calibration curves.\nA2-1.4    For  calibration  checks,  a  reference  particle\ncounter  (RPC)  with  a  good  sizing  capability  could  be\nused. The counting efficiency of the RPC shall be 100%\nfor the particle sizes used in test. The counts of the RPC\nand  the  LPPD  under  test  in  the  corresponding  channel\nshould   be   normalized   to   a   standard   detection   area\n(mm\n2\n).\nA2-2  Particle Size Resolution\nA2-2.1    Particle  size  resolution  of  a  particle  detector\ndescribes its capability to differentiate between particles\nof  nearly  the  same  size,  or  it  is  a  measure  of  the  range\nof  sizes  which  the  counter  would  assign  to  a  particular\nparticle  if  its  size  was  determined  repeatedly.  The\nresolution is specified by the coefficient of variation (in\n%)  obtained  by  dividing  the  portion  of  the  standard\ndeviation of the distribution \u03c3\nLPPD\nthat is contributed by\nthe LPPD by the mean particle size.\nA2-2.2  The employed particle size should be at least 2\ntimes   larger   than   the   lower   detection   limit   of   the\ninstrument and is within a monotonic response range of\nthe LPPD response curve. The size d\np\nand the standard\ndeviation \u03c3\nd,p\nof  the  used  particles  is  necessary  to\ncalculate the resolution.\nA2-2.3      To   determine   the   resolution,   the   standard\ndeviation of the observed particle distribution \u03c3\np,LPPD\nis\ncalculated.  The  quality  of  the  photodetector  is  checked\nby   determining   the   standard   deviation   of   the   pure\nsensor  signal  \u03c3\nV,LPPD\nat  the  analog  calibration  output\nwith a pulse height analyzer.

It  is  assumed  that\nthe  zero  count  level  of  a  correct  operating  LPPD  is\nsufficiently  better  than  its  specification.

The\ndetermination  of  the  counting  efficiency  of  an  LPPD\nrequires  particles  of  known  size  and  concentration  in\nthe  aerosol.  The  counting  efficiency  is  affected  by\nseveral factors.\n\u2022 First,  the  counting  efficiency  is  dependent  on  a\nspecific particle size.\n\u2022 The  effect  of  particle  concentration  is  addressed\nunder zero counting and coincidence.\n\u2022 Due  to  inhomogeneous  light  intensity  within  the\ndetection area of the particle counter, not all small\nparticles   near   the   lower   detection   limit   of   the\ninstrument are detected.\n\u2022 If  the  sampling  flow  is  not  completely  contained\nwithin   the   defined   detection   area,   then   some\nportions of the aerosol will not be counted.\nA2-4.2    Ideally,  the  counting  efficiency  of  a  particle\ncounter covering 100% of the line cross-section area as\ndetection  area  would  consist  of  a  step  function  at  the\npoint of the LDL. Real particle detectors have a gradual\ntransition  (efficiency  curve)  instead  of  a  step  function.\nThe point with 50% detection probability of all particles\nof  a  given  size  moving  through  the  detection  area  is\noften  used  as  a  reference  point.  The  corresponding\nparticle  size  is  called  the  minimum  detectable  particle\nsize (see sensitivity). If the slope of the efficiency curve\nfor   two   detectors   with   the   same   specified   50%\nefficiency  point  is  different,  the  two  detectors  may\nshow different particle counts for the same polydisperse\naerosol.  To  define  an  efficiency  curve,  more  than  one\nparticle  size,  e.g.  5  particle  sizes  around  the  LDL\ncovering   0%   to   100%   efficiency,   should   be   used.\nAcceptable   counting   efficiency   for   single   particle\ncounting  instruments  is  50%  \xb1  20%  at  the  minimum\ndetection  size  and  100%  \xb1  10%  for  all  particles  larger\nthan 1.5 times the minimum size.\nA2-4.3    The  detection  area  of  most  LPPDs  comprises\nonly  a  small  portions  of  the  cross-section  area  of  the\nline.  Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  specify  a  50%\nefficiency point. For this, the commonly used definition\nfor sensitivity could not be used for such instruments.\nA2-4.4  The actual particle concentration is determined\nwith a reference particle counter with a 100% counting\nefficiency for the employed particle size. It is important\nthat  there  are  no  differences  between  the  concentration\nwithin   the   detection   area   of   the   LPPD   and   the\nconcentration monitored by the RPC.\nA2-5  Sensitivity\nA2-5.1    The  particle  size  corresponding  to  the  point\nwith 50% counting efficiency of the particles of a given\nsize is defined as the minimum detectable particle size.\nThis is valid only for particle counters capable to reach\n100%  counting  efficiency  for  a  specific  particle  size.\nThis does not apply to most LPPDs.\nA2-6  Particle Concentration Effects\nA2-6.1  All optical particle detectors are able to operate\naccurately   only   within   a   limited   range   of   particle\nconcentration.  It  is  not  the  scope  of  this  document  to\ndefine  how  this  limit  is  measured  or  how  to  verify  the\nspecification.\nA2-6.2  High Concentration Effects\nA2-6.2.1        The    upper    limitation    of    the    particle\nconcentration is chiefly based on coincidence effects.\nA2-6.2.2    One  effect  is  optical  coincidence.  If  the\nparticle   concentration   is   too   high,   more   than   one\nparticle  is  present  within  the  detection  area  of  the\ninstrument.  The  reported  particle  concentration  will  be\nless  than  the  true  value,  and  the  reported  particle  size\ndistribution  will  be  shifted  towards  the  indication  of\nlarger particles than in reality.\nA2-6.2.3    The  other  effect  is  electronic  coincidence.  It\nis   defined   as   the   inability   of   the   electronic   pulse\nprocessing  system  to  detect  and  size  individual  pulses\nthat are too closely spaced. If there are so many pulses\nthat they cannot completely return to the baseline, they\nbecome   superimposed.   Electronic   saturation   occurs.\nElectronic coincidence introduces errors in both particle\nsize  and  counts  as  well.  Normally,  this  problem  is  not\ncritical    for    modern    electronic    systems.    Optical\ncoincidence  can  become  a  problem  at  particle  levels\nwell below the point where electronic saturation occurs.\nA2-6.2.4        Another    error    can    occur    when    high\nconcentrations  of  particles  just  smaller  than  the  lower\ndetection  limit  of  the  instrument  are  present.  Even\nthough no single one of these particles will be detected,\nscattering-light  levels  from  these  particles  can  increase\nthe background optical noise level. So, errors might be\nproduced in particle count data in the lower particle size\nranges reported by the counter.\nA2-6.3  Low Concentration Effects\nA2-6.3.1    It  is  obvious  that  it  is  necessary  to  collect\nsufficient data to determine number and size of particles\nwithin an acceptable confidence limit."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E104-0303 \xa9 SEMI 2000, 2003 16\nAPPENDIX 3\nAEROSOL GENERATION AND AEROSOL DILUTION\nNOTICE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E104  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot\nprocedures on July 28, 2000 by the European Regional Standards Committee.\nA3-1  Monodisperse Particle Suspension\nA3-1.1    Monodisperse  suspensions  of  particles  (PSL)\nare available in sizes from 0.02 \u03bcm. These particles are\ngrown by emulsion polymerization and are stabilized in\naqueous  suspensions  with  an  anionic  surfactant.  They\ncarry   a   negative   charge   which   contributes   to   their\nstability.  The  suspension  normally  contains  10%  solids\nand  2%  dissolved,  highly  viscous  stabilizer.  The  solid\ncontains up to 8% emulsifier and inorganics.\nA3-1.2      After   evaporation,   these   solids   and   the\nstabilizer  will  both  increase  the  diameter  of  the  single\nparticle and generate a residual nucleus out of an empty\ndroplet.  These  residual  particles  are  called  secondary\naerosol. The diameter of residual nucleus could be up to\n0. 25 \u03bcm  according  to  the  PSL  size  and  dilution  of  the\nsuspension.  Most  of  these  secondary  aerosol  particles\nmight  be  too  small  to  be  detectable  with  commonly\nused  particle  detectors,  but  they  will  have  an  influence\non the noise level because of there high number.\nA3-1.3  Out of a high-concentration suspension it is not\npossible    to    aerosolize    only    individual    particles.\nDroplets  containing  more  than  one  of  the  suspended\nparticles  will  become  undesirable  agglomerates  upon\nevaporation.\nA3-1.4  For this, an adequate dilution of the suspension\nis  necessary  to  avoid  the  formation  of  aggregates  and\nthe enlargement of the particles.\nA3-2  Generation and Dilution of PSL\nSuspension\nA3-2.1      A   diluted   PSL   suspension   for   particle\ngeneration in an aerosol generator can be created by the\nfollowing procedure:\n\u2022 Shaking  and/or  ultrasonic  treatment  of  the  PSL\nbottle distributed by the PSL manufacturer.\n\u2022 Placing  one  drop  of  PSL  in  one  liter  of  deionized\nor  destilled  water  or  Isopropanol.

Great    account    is    taken    of\nconcentration  and  size  distribution  of  the  generated\ndroplets and of the volume flow rate V \u0301\nG\n. To achieve a\nconstant  aerosol  production,  the  volume  flow  rate  and\nthe  droplet  size  distribution  should  be  constant  and\nindependent   of   the   supplies   of   suspension   in   the\nreservoir.

Smaller\nparticles  are  lost  to  the  line  walls  by  diffusion  and  by\nelectrostatic charge effects.\nA4-1.2    A  limitation  of  particle  loss  could  be  achieved\nwith tubing as short and as straight as possible with no\nbends with a radius of curvature less than 100 mm. The\ntubing   of   the   calibration   setup   should   be   smooth,\nconductive,    and    electrically    grounded.    Stainless,\npolished   steel   for   rigid   lines   and   Polyurethane   or\npolyvinyl chloride for flexible lines is found acceptable\nfor   handling   most   aerosols   with   low   electrostatic\nparticle  loss.  If  long  transit  lines  are  required,  they\nshould  be  sized  to  permit  a  Reynolds  number  in  the\nrange  of  5,000  to  25,000  at  the  sample  flow  rate  to\nminimize  particle  residence  time  in  the  tubing  without\ncausing excessive turbulence at high flow rates.\nA4-2  Aerosol Sample Acquisition\nA4-2.1    The  term  isokinetic  sampling  often  is  used  in\naerosol  measurement  and  characterization.  Isokinetic\nsampling of particles in a moving aerosol is performed\nby matching the sample probe inlet velocity (flow speed\nand\ndirection) to the velocity of the moving aerosol. At\nvelocities less than 15 m/s, anisokinetic sampling errors\nare    negligible    for    most    particles    smaller    than\napproximately 5 \u03bcm. Losses of larger particles might be\nsignificant.  The  larger  the  particle,  the  larger  the  loss\ndue   to   inertial   effects.   Isokinetic   sampling   is   not\npossible   in   environmental   conditions   with   varying\nvelocity, motionless air, and turbulent, random, or non-\nunidirectional flow. For better sampling inlet efficiency,\nisokinetic or at least isoaxial sampling is recommended\nat calibration."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"NOTICE: SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or\nrepresentations  as  to  the  suitability  of  the  standards  set\nforth    herein    for    any    particular    application.

However,  this  picture  is  greatly  over-\nsimplified.    For  example,  a  front-opening  shipping  box\n(FOSB)  compliant  with  SEMI  M31  (with  its  thicker\ndoor)  generally  cannot  be  opened  by  equipment  load\nports  that  are  compliant  with  SEMI  E63.    Also,  a  wire\nlink  to  an  OHT  for  the  carrier  handoff  parallel  I/O  can\nalso    be    located    at    the    top    of    the    equipment.\nFurthermore,    the    atmospheric    wafer    handler    for\nemptying the carrier will generally be different from the\nwafer  handler  used  in  the  vacuum  environment  of  the\ncentral handler module of a cluster tool.\n6. 2  Kinematic Coupling \u2014 The foundational document\nof  the  SEMI  standards  for  300  mm  physical  interfaces\nand    carriers    is    SEMI    E57    which    specifies    the\nmechanical  couplings  used  to  ergonomically  align  and\nprecisely   support   300   mm   wafer   carriers.      The\nkinematic coupling consists of three pins that mate with\ngrooves  on  the  bottom  of  the  wafer  carrier  (which  are\nnot specified) for physical alignment and support.  Most\nof  the  dimensions  in  the  SEMI  standards  for  300  mm\nphysical  interfaces  and  carriers  are  determined  with\nrespect to the three orthogonal datum planes defined in\nSEMI E57: the horizontal datum plane, the facial datum\nplane, and the bilateral datum plane.  Such a kinematic\ncoupling can be used at several interfaces, including:\n\u2022 between a FOUP or cassette and an equipment load\nport or vehicle nest,\n\u2022 between a transport cassette and a box, and\n\u2022 between  a  process  cassette  or  quartz  boat  and  the\nfloor of a process chamber."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"E21.1 (Cluster-Tool\nModule Interface)"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"E22.1 (Cluster-\nTool End Effector)\nE26.1 (Cluster-Tool Footprint)\nand\nE25 (Cluster-Tool Access)"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"E57 (Kinematic Coupling)\nE64 (Cart Docking Interface)\nand\nE83 (PGV Docking Flange)\nE72 (Equipment\nFootprint, Height,\nand Wei\nght)\nCarriers:\nE47.1 (FOUP),\nE1.9 (Cassette),\nM31 (FOSB), or\nE103 (SWIF)"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"E62 (FIMS)\nE15.1 (Load Port)\nE84 (Carrier Handoff\nParallel I/O)"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"M1.15, M8, M28 (Wafer)\nE63 (BOLTS-M)\nand/or\nE92 (BOLTS-Light)\nE110 (Indicator/\nswitch Placement)"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Figure 2\nKey Standards for 300 mm Equipment"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E106-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2000, 2004 5\n6. 3  Wafer  Carriers  \u2014  SEMI  E1.9  and  SEMI  E47.1\nspecify the carriers used to transport and store 300 mm\nwafers  in  an  IC  manufacturing  facility.

SEMI  E103  specifies  a  system\nthat  includes  a  box  that  holds  only  one  wafer  and  that\nfits  onto  an  adapter  mechanism  called  a  single-wafer\ninterface   (SWIF).      This   system   appears   to   the\nequipment to be a 300 mm FOUP (except that only the\nvolume around the middle wafer may be accessible).\n6. 4  Equipment  Load  Ports  \u2014  SEMI  E15.1  specifies\nthe carrier load ports at the front of 300 mm process or\nmetrology  equipment  (or  stockers).    In  addition,  the\nsubstrate  port  that  opens  a  FOUP  door  is  specified  in\nSEMI E62 (FIMS).  At the floor below each load port is\na  cart  docking  interface  exclusion  volume  specified  in\nSEMI  E64;  this  volume  can  contain  a  PGV  docking\nflange  as  specified  in  SEMI  E83.  SEMI  E63  (BOLTS-\nM)  or  SEMI  E92  (BOLTS-Light)  or  both  standards\nspecify the mechanical interface between the main part\nof    a    process    or    metrology    tool    and    the    box\nopener/loader unit that opens FOUPs and presents them\nto the tool wafer handler for unloading and loading 300\nmm  wafers.  Also  associated  with  each  load  port  is  a\nwire  or  optical  link  (from  the  equipment  to  the  AMHS\ncarrier  delivery  system)  specified  in  SEMI  E84    which\nis  the  300  mm  version  of  SEMI  E23.    SEMI  E99  and\nSEMI E99.1 specify the electronics and communication\ninterface  between  a  carrier  ID  reader/writer  and  the\nequipment    controller.    SEMI    E101    specifies    the\nfunctional structure model and component behavior for\nthe entire equipment front-end module (EFEM).  SEMI\nE110 specifies the placement of indicators and switch.\n6. 5  Cluster-Tools   \u2014   SEMI   standards   for   300   mm\ncluster  tools  include  SEMI  E22.1,  SEMI  E21.1,  SEMI\nE26.1, and SEMI E25.\n6. 6  AMHS  \u2014  SEMI  standards  for  automated  material\nhandling systems (AMHS) include SEMI E85.\n6. 7  Equipment   Volume   and   Weight   \u2014   SEMI   E72\nspecifies  limits  on  the  footprint,  height,  and  weight  of\nequipment  for  300  mm  fabs.  Separate  limits  are  given\nfor the parts of the equipment in the main fab and in the\nsub-fab.   Separate   limits   are   also   given   for   the\nequipment after it is installed and for the components of\nthe equipment as it is moved into the fab.\n6. 8  Back-End  Standards  \u2014  SEMI  G74  specifies  the\ntape frames used for 300 mm wafers between the dicing\nprocess   and   the   die-bonding   process.      SEMI   G77\nspecifies  the  mechanical  features  of  a  metal  or  plastic\nframe cassette used for framed 300 mm wafers between\nthe   wafer   mounting   process   and   the   die-bonding\nprocess.    Future  standards  may  also  specify  the  carrier\nfor thinned 300 mm wafers and the load port for back-\nend process or metrology equipment.\n6. 9  Standards  of  Uncertain  Use  \u2014  Some  SEMI  300\nmm  standards  that  passed  balloting  have  a  scope  of\napplication  or  extent  of  use  that  is  yet  to  be  fully\ndetermined.  Such standards include SEMI M29 which\nspecifies a manually-opening shipping box for 300 mm\nwafers.    In  the  other  SEMI  300  mm  standards  are  also\nsome  options  of  uncertain  use  such  as  bottom-opening\npods and pods with removable cassettes.\n7  Application of Standards to Products\n7. 1  One-Sided  Interface  Specifications  \u2014  The  SEMI\nstandards  for  300  mm  physical  interfaces  and  carriers\nare intended to set an appropriate level of specification\nthat places minimal limits on innovation while ensuring\nmodularity  and  inter-changeability  between  different\ntypes of products. To accomplish this, only one side of\neach  mechanical  interface  (between  different  types  of\nproducts)   is   specified,   leaving   the   supplier   of   the\nproduct on the other side of the interface more freedom\nto improve their product.  For example, only the bottom\nhalf  of  the  kinematic  coupling  (the  pin)  is  specified  by\nSEMI E57 so that suppliers can be flexible in designing\nwafer  carrier  grooves  that  can  mate  with  it.    Table  1\nshows  which  standards  apply  to  each  type  of  product\nand shows which side of the interface is specified:\n\u2022 \u201cD\u201d indicates if the standard directly specifies that\ntype  of  product  (by  specifying  that  product\u2019s  side\nof the relevant interface).\n\u2022 \u201cI\u201d indicates if the standard indirectly specifies that\ntype of product (by specifying the other side of the\nrelevant interface).\n7. 2  Carriers \u2014 A FOUP is directly specified by SEMI\nE47.1  (for  its  outside  features  not  including  the  door)\nand  by  SEMI  E1.9  (for  its  inside  features).  The  FOUP\nis  indirectly  specified  by  SEMI  E57  (for  its  kinematic\ncoupling grooves) and by SEMI E62 (for its FIMS door\ninterface).  Thus,  if  a  FOUP  door  fails  to  open  or  close\ncorrectly on any load port that complies with SEMI E57\nand   SEMI   E62,   that   FOUP   is   in   violation   of   the\nstandards.  The wafer support function of all of the 300\nmm  carriers  is  specified  directly  (by  specifying  where\nthe  wafers  must  be  located  rather  than  specifying  the\nshape  and  location  of  the  supports),  so  the  300  mm\nwafer standards indirectly specify the carriers.\n7. 3  Stockers \u2014  A  carrier  stocker  is  directly  specified\nby  SEMI  E57  (for  the  kinematic  coupling  pins  on  its\nshelves,   if   any,   and   on   its   manual/AGV/RGV   and"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E106-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2000, 2004 6\ninterbay    load    ports),    by    SEMI    E15.1    (for    its\nmanual/AGV/RGV  load  ports),  by  SEMI  E85  (for  its\ninterbay  load  ports),  by  SEMI  E84  (for  its  carrier\nhandoff  parallel  I/O  at  either  kind  of  load  port)  and  by\nSEMI  E64  (for  the  cart  docking  interface  exclusion\nvolume below each manual/AGV/RGV load port).  The\ncarrier  stocker  is  indirectly  specified  by  the  carrier\nstandards (for the volume required to store and transfer\nthe carriers).\n7. 4  Carrier  ID  \u2014  A  carrier  ID  reader/writer  unit  is\ndirectly specified by a future standard that specifies the\nelectronics   and   communication   interface   between   a\ncarrier  ID  reader/writer  and  the  equipment  controller.\nThe  carrier  ID  reader/writer  unit  is  indirectly  specified\nby  the  carrier  standards  (which  specify  reserved  areas\nfor   carrier   ID   tags)   and   by   SEMI   E15.1   (for   its\nexclusion volume in each load port).\n7. 5  Load Port and Carrier Handler Modules \u2014 A box\nopener/loader (the module on a piece of equipment that\nincludes  load  ports  and  carrier  handling)  is  directly\nspecified by SEMI E57 (for the kinematic coupling pins\non  the  load  port  and  on  its  shelves  if  it  includes  an\ninternal buffer in addition to its fixed buffer), by SEMI\nE15.1  (for  its  load  ports),  by  SEMI  E62  (for  its  FIMS\ndoor  interface),  by  SEMI  E84  (for  its  carrier  handoff\nparallel   I/O),   by   SEMI   E64   (for   the   cart   docking\ninterface  exclusion  volume  below  each  load  port),  by\nSEMI  E72  (for  its  limits  on  footprint,  height,  and\nweight),   and   by   SEMI   E110   (for   indicator/switch\nplacement).    The  module  is  indirectly  specified  by  the\ncarrier  standards  (for  the  volume  required  to  store  and\ntransfer  the  carriers)  and  by  SEMI  E63  and/or  SEMI\nE92 (for the mechanical interface to the main part of the\nprocess   or   metrology   equipment   that   contains   the\nsubstrate handler).\n7. 6  Main  Part  of  Process  or  Metrology  Equipment  \u2014\nThe   main   part   of   process   or   metrology   equipment\n(including the substrate handler) is directly specified by\nSEMI   E63   and/or   SEMI   E92   (for   the   mechanical\ninterface  to  the  module  that  includes  load  ports  and\ncarrier  handling)  and  by  SEMI  E72  (for  its  limits  on\nfootprint, height, and weight).  The substrate handler is\nindirectly  specified  by  SEMI  E1.9  (for  the  features\ninside  most  carriers)  and  it  is  recommended  to  follow\nthe   direct   specifications   in   SEMI   E22.1   (which\nspecifies cluster-tool end effectors).\n7. 7  Material  Handling  Systems  \u2014  A  carrier  transport\nvehicle  is  directly  specified  by  SEMI  E57  (for  the\nkinematic coupling pins on the carrier nest, if any) and\nby  SEMI  E84  (for  its  carrier  handoff  parallel  I/O,  if\nany).  The AMHS system is indirectly specified by the\ncarrier  standards  (for  the  volume  required  to  hold  and\ntransfer  the  carriers),  by  SEMI  E15.1  (for  equipment\nload ports), by SEMI E85 (for stocker load ports, if it is\nan OHT), by SEMI E72 (to allow for equipment height,\nif it is an OHT), and by SEMI E64 and SEMI E83 (for\nthe  cart  docking  interface  exclusion  volume  and  the\nPGV    docking    flange,    respectively,    below    each\nequipment load port, if it is a floor based vehicle)."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E106-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2000, 2004 7\nTable 1  Standards Specifying Each Type of Product (D = Direct Specification, I = Indirect Specification)\nType of Product and its\nComponents"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M1.15, M8, or M28 (Wafer) SEMI E57 (Kinematic Coupling) SEMI E1.9 (Cassette) SEMI E47.1 (FOUP) SEMI M31 (FOSB) SEMI E103 (Single-Wafer Box System) SEMI E62 (FIMS) SEMI E63 (BOLTS-M) and/or E92 (BOLTS-Light) SEMI E15.1 (Load Port) SEMI E64 (Cart Docking Interface) SEMI E83 (PGV Docking Flange) SEMI E84 (Carrier Handoff Parallel I/O) SEMI E99 & E99.1 (Carrier ID Reader/Writer Comm.)

Three important aspects are covered:\na) Contamination due to the minienvironment alone,\nb) Contamination from the use of minienvironments for\nwafer processing, and\nc)  Contamination  from  future  materials  to  be  used  in\nsemiconductor technology.\n6. 2   The  setup  for  each  test  compri ses  an  analytical\nequipment  in  the  analytical  environment  as  well  as  a\ntest    equipment    in    the    test    environment.    Each\nenvironment has to fulfill the following requirements:\n6. 2.1  Analytical Environment \u2014 sha ll be clean enough\nwith    respect    to    airborne    organic    contamination:\nrecommendation  is  less  than  100  pptM  for  organic\ncompounds  with  boiling  points  >  150\xb0C  (Class  MC-\n100, according to SEMI F21).\n6. 2.2  Test Environment \u2014 shall equ al the environment\nin which the test specimen will be used.\n6. 3   Silicon  wafers  are  placed  in  th e  minienvironment\nor  used  for  headspace  sampling  experiments.  These\nwafer  samples  are  then  analyzed  by  gas  chromatogra-\nphy/mass  spectrometry  to  determine  the  amount  of\ncontaminants.\n6. 4   The  wafers  or  wafer  chips  to  b e  used  for  the  test\nmethod  are  decontaminated  as  described  in  ASTM\nF1982 for bare silicon wafers. The surface condition of\nthe   wafer   (hydrophobic   or   hydrophilic)   has   to   be\nadjusted  in  a  reproducible  way  and  has  to  be  the  same\nfor all comparative measurements.\n6. 5   The  wafer  or  the  wafer  chips  a re  placed  in  the\nminienvironment    and    are    left    there    under    static\nconditions for the chosen static storage time (depending\non the intended use of the minienvironment to be tested,\na  time  between  1  h  and  28  d  may  be  used).  When\nloaded into the minienvironment the wafer may have a\ntemperature  which  reflects  production  circumstances\n(i.e., 80\xb0C when unloading from furnace processes). In\nsome   situations   wafers   may   be   exposed   to   severe\nthermal  conditions.  The  minienvironment  should  be\nevaluated under the conditions exposed to. Be sure that\nthe   material   to   be   tested   does   not   undergo   phase\ntransitions under the chosen temperature conditions.\n6. 6   After  the  static  storage  test  per iod,  the  wafer  is\nreturned  to  the  analytical  equipment  and  the  organic\ncontamination on the wafer is measured immediately.\n6. 7   The  quantitative  value  for  the   total  amount  of\noutgassed and adsorbed organics from the minienviron-\nment   is   calculated   as   the   difference   between   the\ndetected  amount  of  contamination  on  a  blank  sample\nvs. the amount on the exposed sample.\n7  Interferences\n7. 1   The  presence  of  organic  conta mination  in  the\natmosphere  of  the  test  environment  may  lead  to  a\nsignificant  contribution  to  the  detected  total  amount  of\norganic  compounds  on  the  test  wafers  or  wafer  chips.\nCare  has  to  be  taken  when  subtracting  the  blank  value\nfrom    the    test    value.    Transport    times    from    test\nenvironment  to  analytical  environment  have  to  be  as\nshort as possible.\n8  Apparatus\n8. 1  For the analysis of organic com pounds on wafers a\ngas  chromatography/mass  spectroscopy  apparatus  with\nthermal     desorption     unit     is     required:     A     gas\nchromatography   (GC)   instrument,   which   utilizes   a\ncapillary  column  to  separate  a  wide  variety  of  organic\ncompounds, combined with mass spectrometer (MS). A\nthermal desorption unit is used to desorb organics from\nsample  thermal  desorption  tubes  and  collect  them  in  a\ntrap. Two types of trapping may be used:"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E108-0301 \xa9 SEMI 20013\na) cooling the trap down to a minimum of -150\xb0C does\nnot require any adsorbent (glass wool may be used) or\nb)  a  Tenax\xae  filled  trap  has  to  be  cooled  down  to  a\nminimum of -25\xb0C.\n8. 1.1  The thermal desorption unit is  coupled to the gas\nchromatography  instrument  via  a  heated  transfer  line.\nThis  apparatus  may  be  used  directly  for  the  desorption\nfrom  wafer  chips  which  are  put  in  empty  glass  (or\nstainless steel) thermo desorption tubes (method A).\n8. 1.2    A   desorption   unit   for   complete    wafers   is\nspecified  in  ASTM  F1982.  In  this  case  sample  thermal\ndesorption tubes packed with adsorbent have to be used\nto  trap  compounds  desorbed  from  the  wafer.  These\nthermal   desorption   tubes   are   analyzed   within   the\nthermal desorption unit (method B).\n8. 2   The  analysis  of  outgassing  org anic  contamination\nfrom minienvironments requires an extremely sensitive\nanalytical  equipment.  Recovery  and  limit  of  detection\nfor   the   different   classes   of   compounds   must   be\nevaluated carefully in order to ensure reliable results.\n9  Reagents and Materials\n9. 1   For  the  materials  used  for  hand ling  and  transport\nof  wafers  clean,  decontaminated  equipment  has  to  be\nused, e.g. tweezers heated in a propane flame. Refer to\nthe  reagent  and  materials  described  in  SEMI  E46  and\nASTM F1982.\n9. 2  Test  Mixture  \u2014  For  the  calibra tion  of  equipment\nand the quantification of the amount of contamination a\ntest  mixture  (\u201dcocktail\u201d)  is  used.  This  mixture  was\nchosen  in  order  to  give  an  \u201daverage\u201d  over  typical\nsubstance  classes  present  in  semiconductor  production\nlines,  which  have  high  sticking  factors  to  the  wafer\nsurface.  The  response  factor  of  the  MS-detection  for\norganics  varies  significantly.  As  this  is  true  for  all\ncontaminants,  the  method  gives  a  realistic  trustworthy\nquantitative correlation to a \u201dtypical average compound\nmixture\u201d of contaminants on wafer surfaces.\n9. 3  Preparation of Test Mixture\n9. 3.1    The   mixture   consists   of   triethy l   phosphate,\n\u03b5-caprolactam, palmitic acid and diethylhexyl phthalate\neach    0.5    \u03bcg/\u03bcl    in    isooctane    (as    solvent).    The\npreparation has to be done according to SEMI E46.\nNOTE 2: A  similar  test  mixture  is  suggested  by  the  working\ngroup WG 031 of the Institute for Environmental Science and\nTechnology (IEST)\n10  Safety Precautions\n10. 1   All  preparation  and  analytical   work  has  to  be\ndone according to local safety regulations.\n11  Preparation of Minienviro nment and\nSample\n11. 1   Minienvironment  \u2014  The  minie nvironment  to  be\ntested  has  to  be  used  as  received  from  the  supplier.

The   cleaning   method   has   to   be\ndefined by the supplier or agreed upon between supplier\nand user of the tested minienvironment.\n11. 2  Sample \u2014 The wafers shall be   made organic-free\nbefore  using  them  to  monitor  organic  contamination.\nThe  surface  condition  of  the  wafer  (hydrophobic  or\nhydrophilic)  has  to  be  adjusted  in  a  reproducible  way\nand  has  to  be  the  same  for  comparative  measurements.\nRefer to SEMI E46 and ASTM F1982.\n12  Procedure\n12. 1    The   procedure   described   below    is   used   for\nobtaining  the  baseline  value  of  the  method  (method\nblank)  as  well  as  the  test  value  for  outgassing  organic\ncompounds  of  the  minienvironment  within  a  defined\nstatic storage time (storage time t\nS\n= 1 h - 28 d).\n12. 1.1  Choose that static storage time  according to the\nintended   use   of   the   minienvironment   (i.e.,   if   the\nmaximum  sit  time  of  wafers  in  a  process  where  the\nminienvironment  is  to  be  used  is  4  h  then  choose  a\nstatic  storage  time  of  4  h).  If  no  static  storage  time\nrelated  to  processes  can  be  defined,  a  recommended\nvalue for the first static storage time is 1 day.\nNOTE 3: Composition of adsorbed compounds may vary with\nstatic storage time.\n12. 2  For transport store the wafers o r wafer chips used\nfor  testing  in  decontaminated,  organic-free  petri-dishes\nwrapped  in  organic-free  aluminum  foil.  Refer  to  SEMI\nE46.\n12. 3  Loading Procedure\n12. 3.1    For   tests   at   room   temperature :   open   a\nminienvironment   to   be   tested   and   load   it   with   a\ndecontaminated  wafer  using  decontaminated  handling\ntools  (i.e.,  tweezers).  Default  storage  location  is  the\ncenter    slot    of    the    minienvironment.    Close    the\nminienvironment.  Leave  the  minienvironment  closed\nfor the chosen static storage time.\n12. 3.2   For  tests  at  elevated  temperatu res  using  a\nwafer  furnace:  place  the  decontaminated  wafers  in  a\nclean  furnace  used  for  production  processes  and  heat\nthe  wafers  under  inert  gas  to  a  temperature  >  120\xb0C.\nTurn  off  the  heating.  When  the  temperature  of  the\nfurnace      has      reached      (90\xb110)\xb0C      open      the\nminienvironment to be tested and fully load it with the"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E108-0301 \xa9 SEMI 20014\nhot      wafers      from      the      furnace.      Close      the\nminienvironment.  Leave  it  closed  for  the  chosen  static\nstorage  time.  For  analysis  use  only  one  wafer.  Default\nwafer is the one in the center slot.\n12. 3.3   For  tests  at  elevated  temperatu res  using  a\nheating   chamber:   open   the   minienvironment   to   be\ntested  and  load  it  with  a  decontaminated  wafer  using\ndecontaminated  handling  tools  (i.e.,  tweezers).  Default\nlocation  is  the  center  slot.  Close  the  minienvironment.\nWrap    the    minienvironment    with    decontaminated\naluminum  foil.  Place  the  minienvironment  in  an  inert\nand clean heating chamber heated to 70\xb0C. Leave it for\n1  h  and  then  remove  it  from  the  heating  chamber  and\nplace  it  at  the  test  minienvironment.  Leave  it  there\nclosed for the chosen static storage time.\nNOTE 4: The  purpose  of  the  aluminum  foil  is  to  prevent\ndirect  contact  between  the  recirculating  hot  air  inside  the\nheating chamber and the minienvironment.\n12. 4   Unloading  Procedure  \u2014   Open   the  minienviron-\nment   and   unload   the   wafer   using   decontaminated\nhandling  tools  into  decontaminated  petri-dishes  and\nwrap  them  into  organic-free  aluminum  foil.  Transport\nthe  wafer  immediately  to  the  measurement  equipment\nand  analyze  the  organic  contamination  on  the  wafer\naccording to the standard ASTM F1982.\n12. 5  Method Blank \u2014 Perform the  test sequence using\na  container  made  completely  of  glass  or  quartz  instead\nof  the  minienvironment.  Use  the  same  static  storage\ntime for the method blank but perform this blank test at\nroom     temperature.     The     container     has     to     be\ndecontaminated  with  respect  to  organics  inside  by  heat\ntreatment (refer to SEMI E46). With this blank method\nthe baseline contribution from the cleanroom air on the\nadsorption   of   organic   contamination   on   the   silicon\nwafer surface is determined.\n12. 6   Analyzing  Procedure  \u2014  Put  th e  wafer  or  wafer\nchips   in   the   precleaned   desorption   unit   or   thermal\ndesorption tube and heat it for 10 min to a minimum of\n275\xb0C  (but  400\xb0C  is  better).  The  desorbed  contam-\ninants  have  to  be  trapped  directly  with  the  cold  trap  of\nthe   thermodesorption   unit   (method   A)   or   first   by\nadsorbent  filled  desorption  tubes  and  then  by  the  cold\ntrap  (method  B).  Desorption  parameters  for  adsorbent\nfilled desorption tube and cold trap may be taken from\nASTM F1982 (see also Section 12.6.1).\n12. 6.1   The  substances  desorbed  shou ld  be  separated\nby   an   appropriate   column   temperature   program.
