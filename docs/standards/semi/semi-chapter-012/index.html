APPENDIX 1
DETERMINING STATIC SENSITIVITY LEVELS
NOTE:  This  appendix  was  approved  as  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E78  by  full  letter  ballot  procedure.  This  appendix  offers
information related to the Sensitivity Levels contained in Section 12.5.
A1-1  Recommended Levels
A1-1.1    The  recommended  charge  and  electrostatic
field  levels  in  this  guide  are  not  based  on  specific
protection  thresholds  for  individual  devices  or  process
tools.  Rather,  their  aim  is  to  classify  the  types  of  ESD
events  or  static  levels  that  are  likely  to  be  of  concern.
Tool manufacturers and users should determine the type
of events that are of most concern to their products and
process,   so   as   to   apply   this   guide   to   their   needs.
Information  on  specific  device  damage  thresholds  and
tool  sensitivities  is  best  determined  on  an  individual
basis.
A1-2  Justification of Guide Recommendations
in Section 12.5 and Table 1
A1-2.1  Recommendations for ESD Damage
A1-2.1.1      Related   Information   R1-1   discusses   test
methods  for  determining  ESD  damage  thresholds  for
semiconductor devices. Devices are qualified according
to the highest ESD stresses they can withstand without
measurable  change  in  their  operating  parameters.  This
section attempts to develop guide recommendations for
minimizing ESD damage based on that discussion.
A1-2.1.2    Industry  Device  Damage  Levels  ó  Each  of
the  test  methods,  HBM,  MM,  and  CDM  have  a  set  of
qualification levels defined. These are contained below.</p><p>HBM Classification Levels

discussed    in    Related    Information    R1-1.4,    ESD
Simulator  testing  uses  different  capacitances  for  each
model. For HBM it is 100 picofarads, for MM it is 200
picofarads, and for CDM it depends on the capacitance
of  the  actual  device  being  tested.  In  any  case,  it  is
charge  (charge  =  voltage  × capacitance)  that  damages
the  device.  It  would  seem  appropriate,  therefore,  that
the  guide  recommendations  in  Table  1  Section  12.5  be
stated in units of charges (e.g. nanocoulombs).
A1-2.1.4      Guide   Recommendations   ó   Based   on
industry  testing  reflected  in  device  data  sheets,  there
appears  to  be  a  wide  range  for  ESD  immunity  in
semiconductor  devices.  This  document  deals  primarily
with ESD occurring within equipment. HBM type ESD
discharges    are    the    least    likely    to    occur    within
equipment. Charged equipment parts contacting devices
(MM)  and  charged  devices  contacting  machine  parts
(CDM)  are  the  most  likely  causes  of  ESD  damage  to
devices  in  equipment.  The  following  sensitivity  levels
are  defined  with  respect  to  the  existing  industry  MM
and CDM classifications.
A1-2.1.4.1      Level   4   ó   Devices   are   essentially
unaffected by any reasonable level of ESD encountered
in equipment. Devices pass testing at levels higher than
MM  Class  M4  (400  volts  ×   200   picofarads   =   80
nanocoulombs).  Equipment  should  not  create  or  store
charge  on  itself  or  on  devices  in  excess  of  the  guide
recommendation.  Guide  recommendation  (table  1  in
Section 12.5) ñ 100 nanocoulombs.
A1-2.1.4.2      Level   3   ó   Devices   are   affected   by
moderate  levels  of  static  charge  in  equipment.  Devices
pass testing for MM Class M4 (400 V × 200 picofarads
=  80  nanocoulombs)  and  most  of  MM  Class  M3  (over
250 volts × 200 picofarads = 50 nanocoulombs). Guide</p><p>SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 2002 10
recommendation   (Table   1   in   Section   12.5)   ñ   50
nanocoulombs.
A1-2.1.4.3    Level  2  ó  Devices  are  damaged  by  lower
levels  of  static  charge  in  equipment.  Devices  pass
testing at MM Class M1 (100 V × 200 picofarads = 20
nanocoulombs)   and   CDM   Class   C4   (1   kV   ×   10
picofarad     device     =     10     nanocoulombs).     Guide
recommendation   (Table   1   in   Section   12.5)   ñ   10
nanocoulombs.
A1-2.1.4.4    Level  1  ó  Devices  are  easily  damaged  by
even  low  levels  of  static  charge  in  equipment.  Devices
pass  testing  at  CDM  Class  1  (125  V  ×  10  picofarads
device  =  1.25  nanocoulombs).  In  most  cases  simulator
equipment  is  not  designed  to  do  testing  at  these  very
low levels for MM. Guide recommendation (Table 1 in
Section 12.5) ñ 1 nanocoulombs.
A1-2.2  Recommendations for Particle Deposition
A1-2.2.1      Related   Information   R1-2   discusses   the
enhancement  of  particle  deposition  due  to  electrostatic
fields  from  charges  on  the  wafer  surface.  This  section
attempts  to  develop  the  guideline  recommendations  for
minimizing particle deposition based on that discussion.
A1-2.2.1.1    From  Equation  3  of  Related  Information
R1-2.2,
N/A=cv
elect
t                                      (12)</p><p>where N/A  equals  the  particulate  burden  added  to  a
wafer  during  exposure  time  t,  exposed  to  a  particle
concentration c,  in  an  environment  characterized  by  an
electrostatic particle deposition velocity, v
elect
.
A1-2.2.1.2    Target  values  for  N/A  are  given  in  the
National   Technology   Roadmap   for   Semiconductors
(NTRS, 1994). These target values vary from 0.02ñ0.01
defects/cm
2
, depending on the critical dimensions of the
technology,   and   represent   an   upper   value   of   the
acceptable  particulate  concentration  on  a  wafer  at  the
conclusion  of  the  fabrication  sequence.  For  individual
processing steps making up the fabrication sequence the
target values are lower yet.</p><p>A1-2.2.1.3    The  variables  c  and  t  are  process  step
dependent and may or may not be controllable. Clearly
minimizing both of these variables is desirable in order
to  minimize  particle  deposition  on  a  wafer  in  any
environment.
A1-2.2.1.4    The  only  variable  in  Equation  12  that
depends  on  electrical  forces  is  v
elect
.  Both  the  particle
charge and the electric field in the vicinity of the wafer
affect   the   magnitude   of   v
elect
.   Particle   charge   is
generally  unknown  unless  it  is  deliberately  controlled
by    a    neutralizing    action,    such    as    flooding    the
environment  with  both  positive  and  negative  charges.
Under these conditions a Fuchs type charge distribution
is a reasonable assumption for the particle charge. This
assumption  was  used  to  calculate  the  values  of  E
0
in
Table R1-2 of Related Information R1-2.3.2.
A1-2.2.1.5    When  the  environmental  electric  field  is
less  than  E
0
,  deposition  of  electrically  ìneutralizedî
particles    is    dominated    by    diffusion.    When    the
environmental    electric    field    is    greater    than    E
0
,
electrostatic  forces  dominate  particle  deposition  even
when particle charge has been ìneutralized.î Values of
E
0
for  a  Fuchs  charge  distribution  can  be  calculated
from  Related  Information  R1-2.3.2  Equation  10.  For
particle  charge  greater  than  the  Fuchs  charge,  v
elect</p><p>increases  by  a  factor  of  q/q
Fuchs
.  Unfortunately,  the
actual particle charge q is generally unknown.
A1-2.2.1.6  Using the process step values of c and t and
the value of v
elect
calculated from Equation 10, the value
of N/A for   any   process   step   can   be   estimated.
Alternatively,   having   a   target   value   of   N/A   and
estimating the value of v
elect
as outlined in the previous
paragraphs,  allows  one  to  calculate  the  tolerable  value
of ct:
ct=<!-- -->[N/A]<!-- -->/v
elect
(13)</p><p>A1-2.2.1.7  Setting N/A = 0.01/cm
2
and using Equation
10  to  calculate  v
elect
for  a  0.1  μm  particle  at  various
values of electric field and particle charge, target values
of ct  can  be  calculated  from  Equation  13.  The  allowed
exposure times in an ISO Class 1 environment (c ≤ 10
-5</p><p>particles/cm

)   can   be   deduced   as   shown   in   the

A1-2.2.1.8  Using higher values of N/A in Equation 13
will  increase  the  acceptable  values  of  ct  and  max  t.
Accepting  higher  values  of  c  will  reduce  max  t.  The
guideline    table    provides    an    order    of    magnitude
assessment  of  the  degree  of  electric  field  and  charge
control  needed  in  specific  operations.  Minimum  field
and  minimum  particle  charge  are  always  the  goal  but
usually  not  practically  achievable.  This  guideline  table
provides    background    estimates    of    envelopes    for
acceptable      operation      in      electrically      charged
environments.
A1-2.2.2    The  following  simplified  table  is  offered  as
an  alternative  to  Table  A1-2  based  on  the  following
assumptions:</p><h1>1</h1><ol><li>Calculations  made  for  Federal  Standard  209E  Class
1 (c ≤ 0.00124 particles/cm

distance  of  one  wafer  radius  from  the  wafer.  While
electrostatic  field  measurements  can  certainly  be
made at this distance, they are typically made at 2.5
cm  (1  inch)  with  common  instrumentation.  This  is
described in SEMI E43. Measurements made at this
smaller  distance  will  be  proportionally  higher,  but
under varying measurement conditions, it is difficult
to  determine  a  precise  relationship  between  electric
field   and   measurement   distance.   To   provide   a
suitable  safety  factor,  assume  a  linear  relationship,
rather  than  one  proportional  to  the  square  of  the
distance.  For  example,  with  a  200  mm  wafer,  4000

uses   the   test   methods   and   ESD   immunity   levels
specified  in  IEC  6100-4-2.  A  recent  survey  of  262
semiconductor  equipment  suppliers  revealed  that  71%
were compliant with the EEC requirements. There is an
expectation  that  all  equipment  to  be  used  in  future  300
mm  wafer  fabrication  will  meet  or  exceed  the  ESD
immunity requirements of IEC 6100-4-2.
A1-2.3.1.1  To test for compliance, measurements were
made with the ESD simulator described by IEC 6100-4-
2    on    a    representative    sample    of    semiconductor
equipment. The results were as follows:</p><p>ESD Simulator Testing Direct Contact Discharge</p><p>Equipment

ìXî indicates that the equipment passes ESD simulator testing at this
level.
NOTE  1:  This  level  is  subject  to  negotiation  and  has  to  be
specified  in  the  dedicated  equipment  specification.  If  higher
voltages   than   those   shown   are   specified,   special   test
equipment may be needed.
A1-2.3.2    Static  Audit  ó  While  equipment  may  meet
the  ESD  immunity  levels  specified  in  IEC  6100-4-2,  it
should   be   remembered   that   static   charge   levels   in
manufacturing   environments   may   be   substantially
higher.   Direct   measurements   of   static   charge   are
difficult,  and  the  presence  of  a  charge  does  not  always
imply   that   an   ESD   event   causing   an   equipment
malfunction   will   occur.   Some   information   may   be
gained    by    using    a    fieldmeter    to    measure    the
electrostatic   field   created   by   the   surface   charge.
Instruments known as EMI locators may also be used in
some   cases   to   determine   if   ESD-related   EMI   is
occurring.    Some    representative    measurements    of
electric   fields   from   objects   in   various   areas   of   a
semiconductor wafer fab are as follows:
• Wet Etch ó 0.1 kV/inch to 30 kV/inch
• Planarization ó 0.1 kV/inch to 20 kV/inch
• Lithography ó 0.1 kV/inch to 20 kV/inch
• Dry Etch ó 0.1 kV/inch to 15 kV/inch
• Thin Film ó 0.1 kV/inch to 15 kV/inch
• Diffusion ó 0.1 kV/inch to 30 kV/inch
• Implant ó 0.1 kV/inch to 15 kV/inch
A1-2.3.2.1    A  knowledge  of  object  capacitance  and
other  physical  properties  is  needed  to  determine  if  any
of   the   above   measurements   indicate   an   equipment
hazard  due  to  ESD  events.  However,  the  range  of  the
measurements  strongly  indicate  that  such  ESD  events
can occur. The examples in Related Information R1-3.3
support this conclusion.
A1-2.3.3 Guide  Recommendations  ó  Based  on  the
static audits and equipment test data, there appears to be
a wide range of static immunity in equipment as well as
in  the  static  charge  levels  in  work  environments.  As
stated  previously,  it  is  difficult  to  establish  a  direct
correlation    between    ESD    events    and    fieldmeter
measurements  made  on  products,  carriers,  or  any  other
objects   in   the   work   environment.   The   following
sensitivity  levels  are  defined  with  recommended  test
levels for each.
A1-2.3.3.1    Level  4  ó  Field  measurements  of  static
charge  at  input/exit  ports  are  expected  to  exceed  10
kV/inch. Equipment should pass ESD simulator testing
at  8  kV  direct  contact  discharge,  18  kV  air  discharge.
Guide    recommendation    (Section    12.5)    -    1200
nanocoulombs (8 kV × 150 picofarads).
A1-2.3.3.2    Level  3  ó  Field  measurements  of  static
charge  at  input/exit  ports  are  expected  to  exceed  4
kV/inch,   but   are   less   than   10   kV/inch.   Equipment
should   pass   ESD   simulator   testing   at   4   kV   direct
contact    discharge,    8    kV    air    discharge.    Guide
recommendation (Section 12.5) - 600 nanocoulombs (4
kV  × 150 picofarads).
A1-2.3.3.3    Level  2  ó  Field  measurements  of  static
charge  at  input/exit  ports  are  expected  to  exceed  500
V/inch,  but  are  less  than  4  kV/inch.  Equipment  should
pass  ESD  simulator  testing  at  2  kV  direct  contact
discharge,  4  kV  air  discharge.  Guide  recommendation
(Section   12.5)   -   300   nanocoulombs   (2   kV   ×   150
picofarads).
A1-2.3.3.4    Level  1  ó  Field  measurements  of  static
charge  at  input/exit  ports  are  expected  to  exceed  zero,
but  are  less  than  500  V/inch.  Equipment  should  pass
ESD  simulator  testing  at  1  kV  direct  contact,  2  kV  air
discharge.  Guide  recommendation  (Section  12.5)  -  150
nanocoulombs (1 kV × 150 picofarads).</p><p>NOTICE: SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or

R1-1  ESD Damage
Contributed  by  Leo  G.  Henry,  Ph.D.,  Advanced  Micro
Devices,  EOS/ESD/LU/EMC  Department,  Sunnyvale,
CA 94538, <a href="mailto:leogesd@pacbell.net." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leogesd@pacbell.net.</a>
R1-1.1  Introduction ó ESD damage to devices occurs
when   they   come   into   contact   with   personnel   and
equipment.  Either  may  store  a  residual  charge  large
enough  to  destroy  the  device  if  a  discharge  occurs.  In
the semiconductor industry, it has been established that
a  significant  proportion  of  customer  field  returns  are
attributed to damage resulting from ESD.
R1-1.2    Description  of  ESD  Damage  Mechanisms  ó
ESD  failures  are  the  result  of  either  a  current-induced
phenomenon or a charge-induced phenomenon, and the
damage  can  either  be  junction,  contact,  dielectric  or
oxide   related.   The   apparent   similarity   in   current-
induced  damage  resulting  from  ESD  due  to  human
body   model   discharges   (HBM)   or   machine   model
discharges  (MM)  results  from  the  thermal  nature  of
both  of  these  process.  The  HBM  and  MM  damages
result   when   the   temperature   (joule   heating)   of   the
region  dissipating  the  ESD  pulse  energy  reaches  a
critical value and melting occurs.
R1-1.2.1    Charge-induced  phenomena  are  predicted  by
the   charged   device   model   (CDM).   For   CDM   type
discharges,  oxide  punch  through  occurs  when  the  ESD
voltage  applied  across  the  oxide  creates  a  high  enough
field  to  break  down  the  oxide.  Excessive  current  flow
results,  causing  an  oxide  short,  but  there  is  no  heat
transfer (adiabatic process).
R1-1.2.2  It should be noted here that the time duration
for   typical   ESD   events   from   charged   objects   and
personnel  ranges  from  10  to  100  nanoseconds,  while
CDM type events occur in less than 1 nanosecond.
R1-1.3  Device Testing Models
R1-1.3.1    Human  Body  Model  (HBM)  ó  The  Human
Body  Model  is  the  oldest  and  the  most  widely  used  of
the three ESD models. The model attempts to replicate
the discharge from a real human when the latter touches
a   device   that   is   at   a   lower   potential.   The   human
capacitance  and  resistance  have  been  ideally  chosen  to
be  100  picofarads  and  1500  ohms  respectively.  The
values  were  chosen  after  measurements  were  made  on
humans   in   varying   positions   with   respect   to   their
surroundings.  The  resulting  discharge  waveform  has  a
double  exponential  shape  with  risetime  range  of  2ñ10
nsec  and  a  decay  constant  (1/e  position)  of  150  ±  20
nsecs. The typical peak currents range from 0.67 Amps
at 1000 volts to 2.67 Amps at 4000 volts.
R1-1.3.2      Machine   Model   (MM)   ó   The   Machine
Model is described by Electronic Industries Association
of  Japan  (EIAJ)  as  a  worst  case  HBM.  The  model
attempts  to  replicate  the  discharge  from  a  metallic  arm
of  an  automatic  handler  coming  into  contact  with  the
metallic  leads  of  a  semiconductor  device  which  is  at  a
lower  potential.  A  capacitance  of  200  picofarads  and
ideally  zero  resistance  produces  a  sinusoidal  decaying
waveform with an effective pulse duration of 200 nsec.
The typical peak currents range from 1.75 Amps at 100
volts to 14.0 Amps at 800 volts. Note that MM failures
occur at 5ñ10 times lower voltage than HBM.
R1-1.3.3 Charged   Device   Model   (CDM)   ó   The
Charged  Device  Model  in  its  purest  form  is  actually  a
field  induced  model  because  the  device  is  actually  part
of  model.  This  model  attempts  to  describe  a  device
which  itself  becomes  charged  due  to  an  external  field,
or  due  to  triboelectric  charging  of  the  device  surfaces.
During     discharge,     the     parasitics     (capacitance,
inductance   and   impedance)   in   the   device   play   a
significant  role  in  the  resulting  failure.  The  discharge
pulse  is  a  sinusoidal  waveform  with  an  extremely  fast
risetime  of  less  than  500  picoseconds.  The  waveform
decays rapidly with a total pulse duration of less than 5
nano-seconds.  The  peak  currents  range  from  2.0  Amps
at  250  volts  charging  voltage,  to  18.0  Amps  at  2000
volts charging voltage.
R1-1.3.4    Correlation  Between  Models  ó  There  is
much  debate  on  whether  or  not  there  is  any  type  of
correlation   between   HBM   and   MM.   While   some
companies report a correlation of roughly 10:1 between
the  two  models,  other  companies  have  seen  anywhere
from  5ñ20:1  differences  in  passing  voltages  between
the  two  models.  There  is  also  no  established  voltage
correlation  between  CDM  damage  and  HBM  or  MM
ESD events. In equipment, ESD damage events will be
related  to  the  MM  or  CDM  types  of  ESD.  Users  will
need  to  determine  the  type  of  ESD  hazard  to  their
devices and choose the test method accordingly.
R1-1.4  ESD Laboratory Simulation Testing
R1-1.4.1 Description    of    Test    Methods    ó    Test
procedures discussed here for ESD simulation conform</p><p>SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 2002 14
to  those  established  by  the  ESD  Association  Standards
ESD  STM  5.1  (for  HBM),  ESD  S5.2  (for  MM),  and
MIL-STD-883,     C/3015.7-method     8.     The     ESD
Association  is  presently  considering  two  documents
related to CDM Testing. Details are to be found in these
standards.
R1-1.4.1.1        Devices    are    qualified    at    a    level
corresponding to the highest ESD stress they are able to
withstand.  These  levels  are  discussed  in  more  detail  in
Appendix A1-2.1.
R1-1.4.2  Simulation Test Results ó In general all units
must be data-logged both pre- and post-stress test. Any
leakage  current  equal  to  or  greater  than  a  specific
amount  (company  dependent  ó  typically  10  micro-
amps  or  less)  is  ìflaggedî  as  a  failure,  and  any  current
shift greater than about 200 nano-Amp is marked on the
record.
R1-1.4.3    HBM  Stress  Testing  ó  An  R-C  network  is
used  to  simulate  the  ESD  event.  In  an  HBM  ESD
Simulator, a high voltage is used to charge the capacitor
(100  pF)  which  discharges  through  the  resistor  (1500
ohms)  into  the  device  under  test.  The  present  draft
standard  (1997)  requires  a  minimum  of  two  discharges
(1 positive and 1 negative) per voltage level.
R1-1.4.4  MM Stress Testing ó An R-C network is also
used  in  the  MM  ESD  Simulator  for  ESD  testing.  High
voltage    charges    the    capacitor    (200    pF)    which
discharges  through  the  short  wire  (zero  ohm)  into  the
device   under   test.   The   present   standard   requires   a
minimum of six discharges (3 positive and 3 negative).
R1-1.4.5    CDM  Stress  Testing  ó  The  package  and
leadframe  of  the  device  are  charged  by  direct  charging
or  field  induction.  For  the  Direct  Charging  Method,
direct  contact  is  made  to  one  of  the  device  leads
connected  to  the  substrate  or  bulk  material  of  the
device.  The  device  is  then  discharged  via  a  one  ohm
resistor to ground.
R1-1.4.5.1  For the Field Induced Method, the device is
placed  on  a  metallic  charging  plate  with  the  device
packaging  material  touching  the  plate.  The  potential  of
the   device   is   raised   by   applying   a   voltage   to   the
charging  plate.  The  induced  voltage  on  the  device  is
discharged  to  ground  through  a  1  ohm  resistor  that
contacts  each  device  lead.  The  present  draft  standard
(1996)  requires  a  minimum  of  6  discharges  (3  positive
and 3 negative) from each device lead.
R1-1.5  Examples of Damage from Device Testing
R1-1.5.1  HBM ESD Damage</p><p>Figure R1-1
Example of HBM Damage</p><p>R1-1.5.1.1    In  this  example  of  HBM  damage  (refer  to
Figure  R1-1),  de-processing  (removal  of  the  processed
layers)   down   to   the   poly   level   and   very   high
magnification   (SEM)   examination   were   required   in
order  to  see  the  failure  site  morphology  of  arcing  from
source  to  drain  within  the  ESD  protective  structures.
The   electrical   characteristics   found   were:   resistive
shorts,   leakages,   low   breakdown   voltages   and   Icc
failures.
R1-1.5.2  MM ESD Damage</p><p>Figure R1-2
Example of MM Damage
R1-1.5.2.1    In  the  above  MM  example  (refer  to  Figure
R1-2), the damage was more severe than for HBM. De-
processing   down   to   the   poly   level   and   the   SEM
examination  showed  the  failure  site  morphology  of
large  deep  pits  occurring  at  the  contact(s)  suggesting</p><p>SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 2002 15
high   current   parasitic   bipolar   action   deep   in   the
substrate and also within the ESD protective structures.
The electrical characteristics found also resistive shorts,
leakages, low breakdown voltages and Icc failures.
R1-1.5.3  CDM ESD Damage</p><p>Figure R1-3
Example of CDM Damage
R1-1.5.3.1  In the above CDM example (refer to Figure
R1-3), the gate oxide damage is seen as a unique failure
signature  beyond  the  input  protection  structures  at  an
internal location of the die. Most often the oxide failure
is located beneath the poly at the field oxide edge, or is
located  at  the  poly  edge  adjacent  to  the  source/drain
junction. To date all CDM ESD damage has been found
in the gate oxide at the input buffer circuitry.

R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition
Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer
Contributed   by   Douglas   W.   Cooper,   Ph.D.,   The
Texwipe Company, Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458.
R1-2.1 Introduction   ó   The   presence   of   excess
electrical  charge  on  a  wafer  can  create  an  electrostatic
field that will lead to accelerated deposition of particles
onto the wafer. This undesirable consequence is but one
of several threats to product yield posed by the presence
of  excess  electrical  charge  on  a  wafer.  Sections  R1-1
and  R1-3  of  this  related  information  discuss  two  other
important  and  potentially  damaging  consequences  of
surface charge.
R1-2.1.1    The  purpose  of  the  discussion  in  this  section
is  to  estimate  the  magnitude  of  electrostatic  field  that
can   be   tolerated   before   electrostatically   enhanced
particle   deposition   becomes   the   dominant   particle
deposition mechanism. Over the particle size range 0.01
to  0.3  μm,  diffusion  is  the  dominant,  non-electrostatic
mechanism   of   particle   deposition.   Thus,   values   of
electrostatic    fields    that    do    not    produce    particle
deposition  velocities  greater  than  those  attributable  to
particle  diffusion  will  be  deemed  tolerable.  A  set  of
such   values   calculated   under   a   specific   and   very
restrictive set of conditions are presented in this section.
R1-2.2    Theoretical Background ó Although there are
numerous  electrostatic  interactions  between  particles
and  surfaces,  the  dominant  one  is  almost  always  the
ìCoulombicî interaction: the attraction (or repulsion) of</p><p>SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 2002 16
a charged particle by a charged surface. This is the only
electrostatic effect considered here.
For particles of one diameter, d, and one charge, q, the
particle  deposition  flux,  j,  (the  number  of  particles
deposited  per  unit  area  per  unit  time)  is  the  product  of
aerosol   particle   number   concentration,   c;   particle
charge, q;  the  electric  field  created  by  the  charged
wafer, E; and particle mechanical mobility, B (terminal
velocity per unit external force):

; B depends
on particle diameter but not electrical properties.
It   is   the   v
elect
values   that   will   be   calculated   for
comparison  with  those  of  v
diff
,  the  particle  deposition
velocity  attributable  to  particle  diffusion.  Values  of  E
for  which  v
elect
&lt;  v
diff
will  be  those  deemed  tolerable  in
wafer manufacturing.
Note that the total number of particles, N, deposited on
a  wafer,  obtained  by  integrating  Equation  (1)  over  the
wafer area, A, and the time of exposure, t, depends on c
as well as the deposition velocity:
N=cqEBAt or N/A=ctv
elect
(3)</p><p>Reducing c   obviously   reduces   N,   but   the   relative
importance of the differing deposition mechanisms and
the  values  of  the  deposition  velocities  associated  with
these mechanisms are assumed to not depend upon c, at
least  to  a  first-order  approximation  (see,  for  example,
Peters and Cooper, 1991).
R1-2.2.1  Effect of the Particle Charge, q ó There are
many    charging    and    discharging    mechanisms    for
particles, so q is hard to predict and likely to be highly
variable.   In   a   normal   atmosphere   the   positive   and
negative    air    ions    tend    to    have    roughly    equal
effectiveness  in  charging  particles,  so  that  the  number
of  positively  charged  particles  is  roughly  equal  to  the
number  of  negatively  charged  particles.  Thus,  about
half the particles will be attracted and half repelled by a
net charge on the wafer. Special circumstances, such as
corona  discharge  ionizers  that  are  not  balanced,  could
alter this conclusion. Without ionizers, cleanrooms tend
to  have  relatively  low  levels  of  ions  compared  to  the
outdoor   or   other   indoor   atmospheres,   because   the
HEPA/ULPA  filters  efficiently  remove  ions  from  the
recirculating air.
R1-2.2.1.1      A   Boltzmann   charge   equilibrium,   the
charge  distribution  approximated  by  aerosol  particles
exiting  a  radioactive  neutralizer,  is  a  plausible  lower
limit  for  particle  charge  and  will  be  assumed  in  the
calculations  of  v
elect
,  using  an  improved  version  of  this
distribution  developed  by  Fuchs  (1964).  Upper  limits
on particle charge are determined by ion emission limits
or,  in  the  case  of  water  droplets,  the  Rayleigh  limit.
However, assuming higher particle charge distributions
usually means that v
elect</p><blockquote><p>v
diff
for virtually any value of
E   &gt;   0   and   that   the   only   method   for   avoiding
electrostatically   enhanced   particle   deposition   is   to
reduce  wafer  charge  to  zero.  Thus,  the  Fuchs  charge
distribution  will  be  assumed  in  calculating  v
elect
even
though  it  represents  the  most  favorable  particle  charge
distribution  for  minimizing  electrostatically  enhanced
particle deposition. Under many practical circumstances
the  particle  charge  will  be  greater  and  the  maximum
tolerable  electrostatic  field  will  be  lower  than  that
calculated for the Fuchs charge levels.
R1-2.2.2    The  Electrostatic  Field,  E,  Induced  by  the
Wafer  Surface  Charge  ó  The  electrostatic  field  will
depend on the charge on the wafer divided by a quantity
with  the  units  of  length  squared;  either  a  distance
squared  (far  from  the  wafer)  or  an  area  (close  to  the
wafer)  or  some  combination  at  intermediate  distances.
While  field  is  not  properly  measured  as  a  voltage,
measuring the voltage, V, at a fixed distance, s, from the
wafer   allows   inferring   the   field   from   V/s   and   the
appropriate  geometric  and  dimensional  factors.  The
electrostatic  field  to  be  used  in  Equation  (2)  can  be
estimated  from  the  ratio  of  the  wafer  charge  to  the
wafer surface area, or the average field near the surface
at the center, E
0
.
R1-2.2.2.1    Very  far  from  the  wafer,  many  wafer
diameters  away,  the  field  created  by  the  net  wafer
charge, Q, will be similar to that from a point charge:

(4)</p></blockquote><p>where k

depends  on  the  system  of  units  used;  and  r  is
the distance from the center of the wafer to the particle.
R1-2.2.2.2    Very  close  to  the  wafer,  a  fraction  of  a
wafer diameter away, the field created by the net wafer
charge is:
E
2
=k
2
′ Q   r

(5)</p><p>where Q&#x27; is   the   net   wafer   charge,   assumed   to   be
uniformly  distributed,  contained  within  the  intersection
of a sphere of radius, r, and centered on the point of the
wafer closest to the particle.
R1-2.2.2.3    This  equation  indicates  that  the  charge
distribution on the wafer can make a difference close to
the  wafer.  For  an  insulating  wafer  with  a  uniform
charge and a radius, R:

at a distance r = R from the center of the wafer.
R1-2.2.2.4  For a conductive wafer, or for a wafer with
localized  regions  of  charge,  the  electric  field  will  vary
over  the  surface,  causing  greater  and  lesser  deposition
velocities.  A  conductive  wafer  will  have  the  charge
concentrated near the edges, producing a relatively high
field  there  and  much  lower  fields  as  the  center  is
approached.
R1-2.2.2.5  Note that both E
1
and E
2
are proportional to
Q    and    therefore,    other    variables    being    equal,
electrostatic deposition is expected to be proportional to
Q. Thus, the criterion to be specified is not the tolerable
charge  on  the  wafer  but  the  tolerable  electrostatic  field
near  the  wafer  surface  (such  as  that  evaluated  at  a
distance   of   one   radius   perpendicular   to   the   wafer
surface  above  its  center),  E
0
.  A  maximum  tolerable
value   of   E
0
will   be   estimated   by   calculating   the
maximum E
0
values  for  which  v

Fuchs distribution for the particle charge.

R1-2.3.1    Particle  Deposition  Velocity  Attributable  to
Convective  Diffusion  (vdiff)  ó  In  a  microelectronics
cleanroom,        airflow        is        generally        laminar
(ìunidirectionalî)  downward  at  about  50  cm/sec  (100
ft/min). If the flow is perpendicular to a surface, such as
a wafer of diameter, Dw, a boundary layer forms across
which  particles  diffuse  to  the  surface.  Liu  and  Ahn
(1987)  adapted  the  correlation  of  Sparrow  and  Geiger
(1985)   and   obtained   a   correlation   for   the   average

no  safe  value  of  electrostatic  field  that  will  avoid

calculated  value  of  tolerable  electrostatic  field  (the
value  of  electrostatic  field  above  which  electrostatic
particle  deposition  becomes  the  dominant  mechanism
of  particle  deposition)  is  just  47  V/cm  for  particles  of
0. 1  μm  diameter  when  the  particle  electrical  charge  is
that   described   by   the   Fuchs   charge   distribution,   a
minimum  value  of  particle  charge  that  is  normally
exceeded   in   most   environments.   In   most   realistic
environments the particle charge will be greater and the
tolerable   electrostatic   field,   even   lower.   Hence   the
conclusion that in all practical processing environments
electrical  forces  will  be  the  dominant  mechanism  of
particle deposition on wafers.
R1-2.4.1      In   a   Federal   Standard   209E   Class   1
environment  (c ≤  0.00124  particles/cm
3
)  with  v
elect
,  ~
0. 01 cm/s (the value predicted by Equation 10 for a 0.1
μm  particle  in  an  electric  field  of  47  Volts/cm)  the
target areal particle densities (N/A = 0.016 particles/cm
2</p><p>for  the  0.25  μm  technology  of  1998)  specified  in  the
National   Technology   Roadmap   for   Semiconductors
(NTRS, 1994) will be reached after an exposure time of
about  1300  seconds,  assuming  c  is  at  its  maximum
allowed concentration.
R1-2.4.2    With  less  favorable  electrical  conditions,  or
higher  particle  concentration,  the  maximum  allowed
exposure  time  becomes  shorter.  In  addition,  the  target
values   for   N/A   continue   to   decrease   with   each
technology  generation.  Fortunately,  one  or  more  of  the
parameters,  particle  concentration  in  the  ambient,  the
charge level on a surface, or the time a charged surface
is   exposed   to   a   given   particle   ambient,   can   be
controlled.
R1-2.4.3      Charge   Neutralization   ó   Achieving   the
Fuchs   charge   distribution   by   means   of   radioactive
isotopes  or  balanced  corona  neutralizers  ó  is  the  first
step  in  controlling  particle  deposition  on  wafers.  This
step, while clearly necessary, is unlikely to be sufficient
to  guarantee  meeting  the  NTRS  requirements  of  the
future.   Steps   to   minimize   environmental   particle
concentration, c, and time of exposure, t, will have to be
part  of  the  strategy  for  creating  acceptable  processing
environments.   Minimizing   these   variables   reduces
particle  deposition  attributable  to  all  mechanisms,  not
just electrostatic deposition.
R1-2.4.4    Contemporary  standards  recognize  the  need
for     reduced     particle     concentrations     in     wafer
environments. For example, the classification ISO Class
1 (of the proposed international standard for classifying
cleanrooms   according   to   concentration   of   airborne
particulate  cleanliness)  describes  an  environment  in
which  the  concentration  of  particles  &gt;  0.1  μm  is  10
-5</p><p>particles/cm
3
or less. In an environment of this quality,
wafer  exposure  can  be  as  long  as  10
5
seconds  at  the
deposition  velocity  predicted  for  neutralized  0.1  μm
particles  (~0.01  cm/s)  and  still  meet  the  target  defect
density  that  the  NTRS  recommends  for  the  0.1  μm
technology  anticipated  in  2007.  Fractional  increases  in
the  electric  field  above  47  Volts/cm  will  decrease  the
allowed exposure time by that same fraction (Equations
10,  12)  ó  an  electric  field  of  94  Volts/cm  reduces  the
allowed exposure time to 5 × 10
4
seconds, etc.

R1-2.6.3    Summary:  Submicron  particle  contamination
continues   to   be   a   concern   in   the   manufacture   of
integrated   circuits.   Quantifying   particle   deposition
velocity (the ratio of particle deposition rate to airborne
particle  concentration)  is  of fundamental importance in
understanding  the  defect-density  impact  of  airborne
contamination.
R1.2.6.4      As   particle   size  decreases,  the  effect  of
electrostatic  charge  plays  an  increasing  role  in  the
deposition  of  particles  onto  surfaces.  This  four-trial
study  examines  the  deposition  of  0.1  to  1.0  micron
particles onto horizontal, grounded and electrostatically
charged, silicon monitor wafers in an 80 feet per minute
vertical    unidirectional    airflow.    The    experimental
deposition velocity results were compared to theoretical
predictions found in the literature.
R1-2.6.5    Three  primary  observations  were  obtained
from  this  study.  First,  measured  values  of  deposition
velocity  agreed  reasonably  well  with  predicted  values.
However,   deposition   velocity   was   not   observed   to
increase below 0.2 micron. Secondly, particles less than
0. 5  micron  were  observed  to  deposit  onto  charged
wafers approximately three to ten times faster than onto
grounded (not charged) wafers. Finally, settling monitor
wafers   may   be   a   time   consuming   (and   expensive)
means  of  certifying  the  cleanliness  of  a  ìcleanî  (less
than   10   ppcf   at   scanner   threshold   particle   size)
environment.  However,  settling-monitor  studies  should
not  be  confused  with  particles-per-wafer-pass  (PWP)
measurements;    PWP    measurements    often    provide
useful  information  regarding  the  performance  of  the
automation  and/or  process  of  a  tool,  even  if  it  is  in  a
very clean environment.

semiconductor  manufacturing  in  many  ways.  These
range  from  increased  particle  accumulation  on  wafer
surfaces  to  electrostatic  discharge  (ESD)  events  which
impact   equipment   performance,   and   in   some   cases
impact factory yields and throughput.
R1-3.1.1          All     areas     within     a     semiconductor
manufacturing  environment  must  be  concerned  with
electrostatic  control.  This  encompasses  initial  wafer
receiving  to  shipping  of  final  product.  In  addition,  the
equipment    which    will    be    housed    within    that
environment  must  also  be  concerned  with  electrostatic
control and electrostatic immunity.
R1-3.1.2  This section highlights issues associated with
static     charge     and     ESD     in     a     semiconductor
manufacturing    environment    and    its    effects    on
production equipment.
R1-3.2        Overview    ó    Static    charge    issues    in
semiconductor  manufacturing  manifest  themselves  in
many  ways.  Problems  occur  by  direct  contact  with
charged  items,  by  induction  from  electrostatic  fields,
and      indirectly      by      radiated      and      conducted
electromagnetic  interference  (EMI)  emitted  into  the
environment as a result of the ESD event.
R1-3.3    Equipment  ESD  Examples  ó  The  following
section  presents  real  world  examples  of  the  cause  and
impacts   associated   with   electrostatic   discharge   and
semiconductor manufacturing equipment.
R1-3.3.1    Charged  operators  came  into  direct  contact
with diffusion furnace control panel. Process aborted on
many occasions resulting in loss of product and reduced
equipment utilization.
R1-3.3.2    Numerous  instances  where  charged  reticles
(photomasks) came into direct contact with a grounded
object.  This  caused  damage  to  reticles  and  impacted
factory    throughput.    Costs    were    associated    with
replacing damaged reticles and requalifying reticle sets.
R1-3.3.3    Charged  operators  came  into  direct  contact
with  electronic  card  cage  of  chemical  vapor  deposition
tool. This resulted in process abort, loss of product, and
reduced equipment availability.
R1-3.3.4    Charged  wafer  cassette  induced  charge  onto
robot  arm  on  wafer  transfer  tool.  Robot  arm  came  into
contact  with  grounded  screw  creating  an  ESD  event.
This  resulted  in  data  corruption  which  caused  robot</li></ol><p>SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 2002 20

the floor. Costs were associated with loss of product.
R1-3.3.5    Automated  material  handling  system  ìcarî
became  charged  while  coming  in  close  proximity  to
ionizer.  Car  came  into  contact  with  grounded  object
during    charging;    creating    data    corruption    which
resulted   in   system   downtime,   impact   to   factory
throughput, and cost associated with the replacement of
control electronics.
R1-3.3.6    Wafer  taping/detaping  tool  generated  charge
during  normal  operation.  Chassis  ground  of  the  tool
was  inadvertently  removed,  causing  high  charge  to  be

Impact  to  equipment  availability,  and  long  solution
time.
R1-3.3.7    Wafers  became  charged  during  spin  rinse
process.   During   transfer   to   wafer   metrology   tool
electrostatic     discharge     occurred,     causing     data
corruption.  This  resulted  in  unexpected  tool  lockups,
and reduced equipment availability.
R1-3.3.8  Ungrounded wall panels became charged and
generated ESD events. EMI produced from ESD events
coupled  into  photolithography  equipment  and  created
data  corruption.  This  resulted  in  impacts  to  equipment
utilization. Long solution time.
R1-3.3.9  Insulative ceiling panels became charged and
generated  ESD  events  which  produced  high  levels  of
radiated and conducted EMI in a test area. EMI coupled
into  tester/handler  and  produced  data  scramble.  This
resulted in reduced equipment availability.
R1-3.3.10    Finished  product  became  charged  during
manual handling. Product came into direct contact with
test/handler   equipment.   This   resulted   in   damaged
circuit   cards   which   needed   to   be   replaced,   and
decreased equipment availability.
R1-3.3.11    Wafer  transfer  cart  became  charged  while
rolling  over  temporary  ìinsulativeî  floor.  Cart  came
into   contact   with   plasma   etcher   control   cabinet.
Resulting  ESD  event  caused  product  loss  and  reduced
equipment availability.
R1-3.3.12    Wafer  polisher  robot  arm  became  charged
during normal operation. Chassis ground wire for robot
left  off.  ESD  event  occurred  causing  data  scramble
which resulted in process being aborted.
R1-3.4    Conclusion  ó  Electrostatic  Discharge  (ESD)
affects   semiconductor   manufacturing   equipment   in
many  ways.  The  issues  are  wide  ranging  from  trivial
lock-ups  and  aborts  of  process  equipment  to  factory
throughput  and  yields  impacts.  The  scope  of  the  ESD
problem is very broad and encompasses every aspect of
semiconductor manufacturing.</p><p>SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 2002 21
RELATED INFORMATION 2
STATIC CONTROL METHODS
NOTE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E78  and  is  not  intended  to  modify  or  supercede  the  official
standard. Determination of the suitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user.
R2-1  Static Charge Control
R2-1.1    It  is  usually  impossible  to  totally  eliminate
static electricity from work areas, but with proper use of
equipment    and    remedial    procedures,    most    static
problems   can   be   controlled.   Many   approaches   to
controlling  static  charge  have  been  tried  over  the  years
and  it  is  clear  that  there  exists  no  single  method  for
controlling all static charge problems.
R2-2  Grounding Conductors and Static
Dissipative Materials
R2-2.1      An   important   consideration   in   selecting   a
method  is  whether  the  charged  material  is  a  conductor
or  an  insulator.  Static  dissipative  materials  are  created
by   lowering   the   resistivity   of   insulating   materials
through  the  addition  of  metal  or  carbon  particles,  or
other chemical additives. Static charge on a conductive
or static dissipative object can be easily controlled if the
object is provided with a path for the charge to flow to
earth ground. While charge is mobile in a conductor (or
in  a  static  dissipative  material),  in  insulators  charge  is
not  mobile,  and  earth  grounding  is  not  an  effective
means of eliminating the static charge.
R2-2.2      Equipment   manufacturers   can   use   both
conductive and static dissipative materials to reduce the
presence  of  static  charge.  If  there  is  a  path  for  the
charge  to  flow  to  earth  ground,  the  static  charge  on
equipment,  and  materials  handled  by  the  equipment,
can be rapidly, and harmlessly, neutralized. Obviously,
the success of earth grounding depends on maintaining
the  integrity  of  the  ground  path.  This  is  sometimes  a
problem  when  high-speed,  moving  parts  of  equipment
must be connected to earth ground.
R2-2.3    Static  dissipative  materials  will  need  to  retain
their    dissipative    properties    over    the    range    of
temperature    and    humidity    conditions    they    will
encounter,  and  not  change  significantly  over  time.  In
cleanrooms   they   must   also   meet   requirements   for
avoiding  micro-particle  production  and  outgassing.  As
long  as  the  ground  connection  is  maintained,  these
ìpassiveî  procedures  offer  reasonable  protection  to  the
equipment and product from sources of static charge.
R2-2.4    Unfortunately,  these  methods  do  not  provide
complete  protection  from  static-related  problems.  Even
when  earth  grounding  is  an  option,  it  is  subject  to
human error. In applications where contamination is an
issue,  additives  and  carbon  particles  used  in  static-
dissipative     materials     may     become     sources     of
contamination themselves. When earth grounding or the
use of dissipative materials is either inappropriate or not
cost effective, ionization can be used.
R2-3  Ionization
R2-3.1    More  often  than  not,  the  product  itself  uses
insulating      materials,      making      earth      grounding
unavailable    as    an    option.    While    silicon    is    a
semiconductor,  its  oxide  coating  transforms  it  into  an
insulator.  Teflon  is  used  in  many  chemical  processes,
and  quartz  in  high  temperature  processes.  Epoxy  and
ceramic   packages   are   used   for   integrated   circuits.
Insulators  are  easily  charged,  retain  their  charge  for
long periods of time, and are often close to the product.
Dealing  with  static  charge  on  insulators  and  isolated
conductors  will  often  require  the  use  of  some  type  of
ionization.  Ionizers  are  the  most  effective  means  of
dealing  with  static  charges  on  insulators  and  isolated
conductors.
R2-3.2    For  purposes  of  static  charge  control,  ions  are
molecules  of  the  gases  in  air  (nitrogen,  oxygen,  water
vapor,  and  carbon  dioxide)  that  have  lost  or  gained  an
electron.  Ions  are  present  in  normal  outside  air  but  are
removed  when  air  is  subjected  to  filtration  and  air
conditioning. Ionization systems work by increasing the
conductivity  of  the  air  with  the  ionized  gas  molecules.
When  ionized  air  comes  in  contact  with  a  charged
surface, the charged surface attracts ions of the opposite
polarity.  As  a  result,  the  static  electricity  that  has  built
up on products, equipment and surfaces is neutralized.
R2-3.3    The  most  common  methods  of  producing  air
ions are radioisotopes and ìcorona dischargeî resulting
from  the  electric  field  created  when  high  voltage  is
applied to a sharp point.
R2-3.4      The   radioisotope   most   commonly   used   to
produce  ionization  is  Polonium
210
,  an  alpha  particle
emitter. The alpha particle collides with the surrounding
gas  molecules,  dislodging  electrons,  which  results  in
pairs of positive and negative ions.
R2-3.5    The  corona  discharge  method  produces  a  very
high electric field that interacts with the electrons in the
surrounding  gas.  The  polarity  of  the  ions  depends  on
the  polarity  of  the  high  voltage  on  the  emitter  point.
Ions  of  opposite  polarity  to  the  charged  surface  are
required. Either polarity of static charge may be created
in the equipment or on the product.</p><p>SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998, 2002 22
R2-3.6    Ionizers  in  equipment  must  deliver  ionization
over   a   wide   range   of   humidity   and   temperature
conditions.  Back-end  assembly  and  test  areas  often  do
not  have  the  level  of  temperature  and  humidity  control
found  in  front-end  wafer  production.  Ionizers  installed
in the cramped spaces of production equipment will be
close  to  the  product,  in  areas  surrounded  by  grounded
metal  parts.  Ionizers  should  isolate  the  emitter  points
from  both  the  product  and  adjacent  grounded  surfaces.
Ionizers  should  produce  sufficient  ions  to  discharge
static  on  surfaces  and  products  moving  at  high  speeds
despite    losses    to    ground.    Most    ionizers    require
maintenance    and    periodic    verification    of    their
performance.
R2-4  Problem of Controlling Static Charge in
Manufacturing Equipment
R2-4.1      The   interior   of   high   speed   production
equipment  presents  a  challenge  to  most  static  control
methods.  The  cost  of  production  space  is  high  and
requires   that   equipment   occupying   the   space   be
compact  and  operate  at  as  high  a  speed  as  practical.
Product is moved through small spaces at high speed by
a variety of robotic and other mechanisms. Triboelectric
charging  (charge  generation  due  to  friction  or  contact
and separation of dissimilar materials) and contact with
ground    are    almost    unavoidable.    Grounding    of
equipment parts that contact the product presents added
difficulties  when  the  equipment  parts  are  moving  at
high    speeds.    Dissipating    charge    from    insulating
surfaces  and  integrated  circuit  (IC)  packages  may  be
difficult  if  the  charged  surfaces  are  not  accessible.
Using   ionizers   in   these   confined   spaces   presents
challenges.</p><p>SEMI E78-1102 © SEMI 1998,2002 23

equipment productivity.
2  Scope</li><li>1    The  document  defines  metrics  and  calculations  for
measurement of equipment productivity.</li><li>2    In  the  context  of  this  document,  it  is  important  to
note  that  “equipment  productivity”  is  impacted  greatly
by  factors  far  beyond  the  equipment  itself,  including
operator,     recipe,     facilities,     material     availability,
scheduling requirements, etc.</li><li>3    Effective  application  of  this  specification  requires
that equipment performance is tracked using the metrics
for      Equipment      Reliability,      Availability,      and
Maintainability   (RAM)   established   in   SEMI   E10.
Additionally,  the  Automated  Reliability,  Availability,
and Maintainability Standard (ARAMS) SEMI E58 can
be   used   for   equipment   with   ARAMS   capability.
Productivity  metrics  for  flexible-sequence  cluster  tools
require  tracking  of  SEMI  E10  equipment  states  and
recipes  at  the  level  of  individual  processing  modules.
The  Equipment  Performance  Tracking  (EPT)  Standard
SEMI  E116  assists  SEMI  E79  by  providing  the  status
of   the   major   modules   of   the   equipment   allowing
performance  metrics  to  be  tracked  at  the  module  level.
SEMI  E116  also  assists  SEMI  E79  by  providing  task-
level   detail   of   the   equipment   or   module’s   current
activity,  allowing  performance  metrics  to  be  tracked  at
the  task  level.  Productivity  performance  of  a  flexible-
sequence cluster tool is then calculated as the aggregate
productivity  performance  of  its  individual  processing
modules.</li><li>4    This  document  is  currently  limited  to  measuring
equipment    productivity    using    Overall    Equipment
Efficiency  (OEE)  as  the  metric,  and  does  not  address
the  impact  of  productivity  changes  on  cost,  cycle  time,
or other measures. This document does not address any
RAM issues over and above those in SEMI E10.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

NOTE  2:    Recipe  specifications  and  settings  for  THT  are  the

Equipment  of  the  same  design  (e.g.,  same  make  and  model)
are expected to have the same THTs, whereas equipment of a

5  Equipment Productivity Measurement
5. 1    The  OEE  calculation  has  been  stated  in  terms  that
are consistent with SEMI E10.  Reference may be made
to Figure 1.
5. 1.1  Figure 2 indicates how total time may be divided
into  portions  representing  theoretical  production  time
for  effective  units  and  various  sources  of  productivity
loss.  The  domain  for  productivity  improvement  of  all
losses  except  operational  efficiency  is  shared  between
the     equipment     supplier     and     equipment     user.
Productivity  improvement  of  operational  efficiency  is
the exclusive domain of the equipment user.
5. 1.2  The formulas introduced in this section require as
inputs  the  following  fundamental  quantities:  total  time,
equipment   uptime,   production   time,   and   theoretical
production  time.  Sample  calculations  for  each  of  the
formulas are provided in Appendix 1.
5. 1.3        For    efficiency    measurement    of    individual
processing  modules  or  of  fixed-sequence  cluster  tools,
the   fundamental   quantities   may   be   tallied   in   a
straightforward manner, and consequently the formulas
of  this  section  may  be  applied  in  a  straightforward
fashion.
5. 1.4  For  efficiency  measurement  of  flexible-sequence
cluster    tools,    determination    of    the    fundamental
quantities     requires     more     involved     calculations.
Formulas  are  provided  in  Section  6  for  computing  the
fundamental   quantities   for   flexible-sequence   cluster
tools.  These  fundamental  quantities  then  may  be  used
as inputs to the formulas of this section to compute the
efficiency of a flexible-sequence cluster tool.
5. 1.5    Additional  supplemental  efficiency  metrics  that
will  enable  users  to  assess  more  specific  aspects  of
equipment productivity are:
• Reference OEE,
• Engineering OEE,
• Value-Added In-Process OEE,
• Demand Equipment Efficiency,
• Production Equipment Efficiency, and

6. 1      This   section   provides   definitions   and   formulas
applicable    to    flexible-sequence    cluster    tools    for
computing    the    following    fundamental    quantities:
theoretical production time, production time, equipment
uptime  and  total  time.  These  quantities  serve  as  inputs
to    the    formulas    of    Section    5    for    efficiency
measurement.
6. 1.1      Flexible-sequence   cluster   tool   productivity   is
measured  at  the  individual  processing  module  level  of
detail according to a virtual machine model described in
this  section.    Productivity  performance  for  the  entire
flexible-sequence  cluster  tool  is  then  calculated  as  the
aggregate  productivity  performance  of  its  individual
processing modules.
NOTE    5:        Evaluation    of    flexible-sequence    cluster    tool
productivity  does  not  necessarily  apply  to  the  evaluation  of
flexible-sequence cluster tool RAM.
6. 2  Virtual Machine Model
6. 2.1    A  virtual  machine  is  an  individual  processing
module  in  combination  with  the  transport  mechanisms
that  serve  that  processing  module.    When  a  transport
mechanism is engaged in a material handling operation
that does not involve a particular processing module, it
is  not  considered  to  be  operating  as  part  of  the  virtual
machine defined for that processing module.
6. 2.2    Theoretical  production  time  per  unit  for  a  recipe
is   the   sum   of   theoretical   times   for   all   required
operational elements:
• Wafer loading,
• Elements occurring within a process module, and
• Wafer unloading.
6. 2.2.1    Where  appropriate,  a  combined  loading  and
unloading   time   may   be   replaced   with   a   single
theoretical value for a wafer exchange.
6. 3  Fundamental  Quantities  for  Virtual  Machines  and
Flexible-Sequence Cluster Tools ó This section defines
fundamental quantities that are evaluated for individual
virtual  machines  and  flexible-sequence  cluster  tools  as
inputs  to  the  formulas  presented  in  Section  5.    In  each
case,  the  fundamental  quantity  is  determined  for  each
individual  virtual  machine  within  a  flexible-sequence
cluster  tool.    The  equivalent  fundamental  quantity  for
the  flexible-sequence  cluster  tool  is  the  sum  of  the
quantities for the individual virtual machine.
NOTE 6:  It is recognized that application-specific
interactions    between    virtual    machines    within    flexible-
sequence   cluster   tools   may   impose   varying   amounts   of
standby   time   on   the   individual   virtual   machines.   This
approach  treats  these  interactions  as  standby  losses  for  the
flexible-sequence   cluster   tool   and   does   not   make   any</p><p>SEMI E79-0304 © SEMI 1999, 2004 7

that  this  aggregate  measure  may  be  larger  than  the  elapsed

aggregate flexible-sequence cluster tool metrics.
6. 3.3  Equipment Uptime
6. 3.3.1    Equipment  uptime  is  defined  to  measure  the
total time, during a period of observation, that a virtual
machine  or  a  flexible-sequence  cluster  tool  is  in  a
condition to perform processing in some form.
6. 3.3.2        SEMI    E10    defines    equipment    uptime    as
including  E10  productive  time,  engineering  time,  and
standby  time.    This  definition  applies  to  individual
virtual  machines  of  a  flexible-sequence  cluster  tool.
For  the  flexible  sequence  cluster  tool  as  a  whole,
production  time  is  the  sum  of  production  times  for  the

SUPPLEMENTAL PRODUCTIVITY METRICS FOR FOCUSED
PRODUCTIVITY STUDIES
NOTICE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E79  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot
procedures on December 15, 1999 by the North American Regional Standards Committee.
A2-1  Supplemental Productivity Metrics with
Total Time as the Denominator
A2-1.1      OEE   is   based   on   “as-is”   assumptions   with
respect  to  process  specifications  (recipes),  equipment
type, and equipment design. In this way, OEE measures
the    performance    of    the    organizations    of    the
manufacturer   and   the   equipment   supplier   as   they
attempt  to  drive  equipment  performance  to  a  potential
defined  by  given  process  specifications  and  a  given
equipment type and design.
A2-1.2    This  section  presents  three  variations  on  the
OEE    calculation    that    additionally    measure    the
performance of engineering and design organizations as
they  attempt  to  improve  equipment  selection,  process
specifications   and   equipment   design.   These   three
variants   are   each   based   on   more   discriminating
definitions  of  the  theoretical  production  time  per  unit,
as shown in Figure A2-1. Total time is the denominator
for each metric.</p><p>Availability Efficiency

A2-1.3.1        Reference    OEE    provides    a    measure    of
equipment    productivity    relative    to    a    benchmark
theoretical  production  time.  The  reference  theoretical
production  time  per  unit  for  a  given  recipe  is  the  time
required  by  the  benchmark  equipment  (i.e.,  the  fastest
equipment    model    of    similar    type),    running    the
comparable recipe for a benchmark product and process
design.  Reference  theoretical  production  time  per  unit
(RTHT)  shall  be  defined  to  be  less  than  or  equal  to
theoretical  time  per  unit  (THT)  used  in  calculating
standard  OEE.  The  R-OEE</p><p>score  may  be  compared
against    the    standard    OEE    score    to    assess    the
productivity loss arising from the application of inferior
equipment.</p><p>Reference OEE  (R-OEE)

theoretical  production  time  for  effective  units  compared  to
that utilized in Engineering OEE and Value-Added In-Process
OEE.  Productivity losses indicated by R-OEE and by E-OEE

A2-2  Additional Productivity Metrics Involving
Denominators Other Than Total Time
A2-2.1  This section presents three productivity metrics
for   assessing   efficiency   of   the   equipment   resource
relative to a time frame less than total time.
A2-2.2  Production  Equipment  Efficiency  and  Demand
Equipment  Efficiency  exclude  portions  of  no  product
time from productivity losses, as depicted in Figure A2-
2.  While  the  idle  time  due  to  no  product  is  excluded
from the operational losses in these particular measures
of  equipment  efficiency,  the  user  should  be  aware  that
the  additional  productivity  losses  due  to  sub-optimal
load   or   batch   sizes   may   also   be   present   as   rate
efficiency   losses.      Such   losses,   which   result   from
fluctuations in product flow or tool loading policies, are
considered in any equipment efficiency calculation that
uses theoretical time per unit.
A2-2.3  Production  Equipment  Efficiency  (PEE)
 A
measure of equipment productivity during the time that
work is available to process at the tool.  One application
of PEE is to measure the productivity of non-constraint
tools,  which  are  expected  to  have  periods  of  idle  time
due to lack of available work.</p><p>Production Equipment Efficiency  (PEE)

RELATED INFORMATION 1
GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING THEORETICAL PRODUCTION TIME
PER UNIT
NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E79. This related information was approved for
publication by vote of the responsible committee on December 15, 1999.
R1-1  Background
R1-1.1  Overall    Equipment    Efficiency    (OEE)    is
computed  in  terms  of  the  theoretical  production  time
per unit for each recipe performed. This theoretical time
per   unit   is   based   on   the   actual   recipe,   the   actual
equipment design in use, and an assumed load size that
optimizes  equipment  throughput  (expressed  in  units  of
output per hour) for that recipe.
R1-1.2    OEE  is  intended  to  express  the  true  efficiency
of   the   equipment   resource.   A   score   of   50%   OEE
indicates  that  exactly  half  of  the  maximum  productive
potential of the equipment resource is being realized; a
score  of  100%  indicates  that  no  further  increase  in
productivity  is  feasible,  taking  the  existing  process
recipes and equipment design as given.
R1-1.3    To  accurately  calculate  OEE  in  turn  requires
that  theoretical  production  times  per  unit  be  accurately
defined.    In  particular,  theoretical  production  times  per
unit shall be defined so that the speed losses are always
non-negative, i.e.,</p><p>Speed Losses
= (Production Time) - (Theoretical Production Time for
Actual Units) ≥ 0</p><p>R1-1.4              According       to       now-classical       industrial
engineering  practice,  standards  for  ideal  performance
are determined by application of the following:
• Break  work  methods  down  into  their  operational
elements (hereafter simply referred to as elements).
• Study   each   of   these   elements   separately   to
determine its ideal duration.
• Design  a  new  ideal  method  offering  the  shortest
sequence of only the necessary elements (where the
term   “sequence”   as   used   herein   may   involve
parallel performance of some or all elements).
R1-1.5    It  is  remarked  that  even  when  the  durations  of
all elements are ideal, if the sequence of elements is not
ideal,  ideal  overall  performance  cannot  be  achieved.
Based   on   this   understanding,   theoretical   processing
time for an equipment recipe shall be based on both an
ideal element sequence as well as ideal durations for all
elements.
R1-2  Modeling Operational Element
Sequences
R1-2.1        A    graphical    model    of    the    sequence    of
operational elements comprising the performance of an
equipment   recipe   can   be   helpful   for   determining
theoretical production time per unit. This model has the
following components:
R1-2.2  Resource  Utilization  Chart  —  a  Gantt  chart
displaying a separate timeline for each primary resource
within  the  equipment.  Utilization  sequences  displayed
for  each  primary  resource  may  be  used  to  show  how
each  resource  within  an  equipment  system  is  utilized,
and how resources may interact.
R1-2.3  Operational    Element    —    An    operational
element   occurring   within   a   utilization   sequence   is
depicted by a box-shaped bar with a label.  The time for
this element to execute may be fixed, recipe-dependent,
or  calculated  from  parameters.    Operational  elements
that are not related to material handling operations have
a thick outline.
Operational Element</p><p>R1-2.3.1  Material   handling   elements   have   a   thin
outline.
Material Handling
Operational Element</p><p>R1-2.4  Repeated  Groups  —  A  bracket  underneath  a
group  of  operational  elements  indicates  that  the  group
repeats  multiple  times  based  on  the  parameter  shown.
For  elements  that  occur  conditionally,  the  number  of
repetitions  may  be  zero.  These  repetitions  apply  to  all
elements in all timelines positioned in the vertical range
of the bracket.

Operational Element(s)
x (# repetitions)</p><p>R1-2.5  Sub-Sequences  —  A  number  in  front  of  an
element  label  indicates  that  the  element  represents  a</p><p>SEMI E79-0304 © SEMI 1999, 2004 19
group  of  elements  defined  elsewhere.  This  group  is
referred to as a sub-sequence.</p><ol><li>1 Sub-Sequence
Operational Element</li></ol><p>R1-2.6  Calculating  Theoretical  Production  Time  Per
Unit  —  Any  element  sequence  may  be  modeled  as  an
activity-on-node   network   derived   from   precedence
constraints on the operational elements and precedence
constraints  on  the  allocation  of  equipment  resources  to
the elements.  Using the network model, the duration of
the  element  sequence  is  simply  the  duration  of  the
critical path through the network.
R1-2.6.1    Theoretical  production  time  per  unit  is  then
the   theoretical   duration   for   the   element   sequence
divided  by  the  number  of  units  processed  during  the
sequence.
Theoretical Production Time Per Unit for recipe i <!-- -->[THT
i
]<!-- -->=
= (Theoretical Duration for the Element Sequence)
/(Number of Units Processed During Sequence)
R1-2.7  Allowances for Non-Steady-State Processing —
For  complicated  batch-load  equipment  models,  it  is
useful  to  divide  resource  sequences  into  a  beginning
phase,  a  steady-state-phase,  and  an  ending  phase.  For
modeling  theoretical  time,  it  is  important  to  determine
what allowances to make, if any, for the beginning and
ending  phases.    For  machines  that  are  limited  in  the
number  of  lots  that  can  be  processed  in  a  continuous
cascade,   appropriate   allowances   shall   be   made   for
beginning  and  ending  phases.  However,  for  machines
that are capable of running continuously, the beginning
and   ending   phases   should   not   be   considered   in
determining theoretical production time.
R1-2.7.1          Under     certain     conditions,     setup     type
operations that are not tracked as part of downtime shall
be   considered   as   part   of   the   theoretical   resource
sequence   for   a   tool.      These   conditions   include
operations that shall occur in every machine cycle, e.g.
recipe  download,  as  well  as  operations  that  occur  on
other  regular  intervals,  e.g.,  one  clean  cycle  every  75
wafers.   In   general,   any   activity   that   occurs   on
predictable intervals and is a necessary part of a recipe
specification  should  be  considered  in  the  equipment
sequence for determining theoretical production time.
R1-2.7.2    Operations  that  occur  at  irregular  intervals  or
that  apply  to  an  unpredictable  quantity  of  wafers,  lots,
or   loads   are   not   counted.      An   example   of   an
unpredictable  frequency  setup  is  a  recipe  changeover,
when the machine is changed from the requirements of
one process recipe to meet the needs of another, e.g., a
species  change  as  on  an  ion  implant  system.  The  ideal
frequency of these events is taken as zero.
R1-2.8  Optimality  —  Theoretical  sequences  shall  be
designed  so  as  to  optimize  equipment  throughput  by
using  only  the  best  configuration  of  elements  and  an
optimal  load  size.    Optimal  sequences  may  differ  for
different   recipes   performed   on   the   same   machine.
Optimal  load  sizes  are  not  necessarily  maximum  load
sizes.
R1-2.9  Error-Checking  Element  Sequences   Once  a
theoretical   sequence   is   specified   for   a   piece   of
equipment, it can be compared against actual equipment
operations  to  check  for  errors.    If  discrepancies  are
found, three possibilities to investigate are:
• The sequence contains extraneous elements.
• The sequence is missing necessary elements.
• The   series   and   parallel   relationships   between
elements are not correctly specified.
R1-2.9.1    What  may  at  first  appear  to  be  sequence
specification  errors  may  in  fact  be  undiscovered  rate
efficiency losses embedded in the equipment sequence.
Because    sequences    are    fundamental    to    overall
performance,   it   is   important   to   rule   out   sequence
specification errors to preclude erroneous assignment of
rate efficiency losses to individual elements.
R1-2.10  Example Resource Utilization Sequence  An
example  of  a  resource  utilization  sequence  is  given  in
Figure   R1-1.   This   example   represents   a   particular
instance  of  a  photolithography  stepper  that  exposes
patterns  from  a  reticle  onto  a  wafer.  This  example
assumes that the stepper receives individual unexposed
wafers from a linked coat track and transfers individual
exposed wafers to a linked develop track.
R1-2.10.1    First,  a  reticle  box  shall  be  loaded  into  the
stepper  reticle  handling  system  (“load  box”).  Before  a
wafer  may  be  exposed,  the  reticle  shall  be  set  and
aligned. A wafer shall also be loaded onto the pre-align
chuck,  pre-aligned,  and  transferred  to  the  exposure
stage.  Each  wafer  is  exposed  then  transferred  to  a  post
processing    relay    chuck.    The    transfer    operation
simultaneously removes an exposed wafer and replaces
it with an unexposed wafer.
R1-2.10.2    The  expose  operation  is  represented  by  the
sub-sequence shown in Figure R1-2. Depending on the
recipe  to  be  executed,  the  expose  sub-sequence  may
consist  of  several  different  reticle  images  requiring
changes of “blade” positioning. For each image, there is
one  “align”  operation.  For  each  individual  exposure,
there is a “step” operation, a “level” operation, and the
“expose”   operation   itself.   Within   the   same   image,
different   exposures   may   require   different   leveling
times, as well as different stepping times.</p><p>SEMI E79-0304 © SEMI 1999, 2004 20</p><p>Pre-AlignLoad

represent  the  beginning  phase  of  the  main  equipment
sequence. If the stepper is capable of processing wafers
of  the  same  reticle  indefinitely,  then  the  beginning
phase is not included in theoretical production time. If,
however,  there  is  a  hardware  and/or  software  limit  to
the  number  of  wafers  that  may  be  run  consecutively,
then the beginning phase shall be counted in theoretical
production time.
R1-3  Modeling Theoretical Durations for
Operational Elements
R1-3.1      Once   a   theoretical   equipment   sequence   is
defined,  the  next  step  is  to  measure  and/or  model
theoretical durations for each operational element in the
sequence.  As  a  rule,  it  is  preferable  to  acknowledge  in
the  model  an  elemental  speed  loss  that  can  never  be
recovered  in  lieu  of  inadvertently  overlooking  another
loss that could be reduced or eliminated.
R1-3.2  Legitimate  Observations  —  Each  theoretical
element duration should always be less than or equal to
any legitimate  observation  for  that  element,  where  a
legitimate  observation  is  a  traceable  instance  of  an
operational  element  that  does  not  result  in  a  loss  of
quality.  The  time  for  any  legitimate  observation  that  is
less   than   the   existing   theoretical   element   duration
should  become  the  new  theoretical  element  duration.
For   legitimate   instances   of   the   same   operational
element on different instances of identically configured
equipment, the best time observed among all equipment
of  that  type  should  be  used  as  the  theoretical  element
duration.
R1-3.3  Basis  for  Theoretical  Element  Durations  —
Theoretical  element  durations  may  be  based  on  time
studies,     nominal     parameters,     and/or     parametric
modeling.
R1-3.3.1  Time Studies  Most mechanical operational
elements that have fixed execution times, like transport
and load lock operations, can be accurately determined
by  time  studies  using  either  stopwatches,  equipment
data  acquisition  systems,  timing  systems  built  into  the
equipment, or stand-alone data acquisition systems that
use  sensors  to  detect  equipment  events  and/or  state
changes.
R1-3.3.1.1      When   it   is   difficult   to   directly   measure
individual  elements,  collections  of  elements  may  be
observed   and   timed   instead.   On   systems   where   a
number of consecutive identical elements occur too fast
to be measured individually, a set of elements should be
timed, and the time should be divided by the number of
elements   in   the   set.      For   even   more   complicated
situations,  element  times  may  be  derived  algebraically
from  observations  of  several  linearly  independent  sets
of operational elements.
R1-3.3.2  Nominal  Parameters  —  There  are  instances
where  it  is  desirable  to  use  nominal  parameters  to
represent  theoretical  conditions  rather  than  using  direct
observations, such as when:</p><p>SEMI E79-0304 © SEMI 1999, 2004 21
• Nominal parameters are more representative of the
physical systems being studied.
• Nominal parameters are more representative of the
desired system performance.
• It is not practical to obtain reliable data.
R1-3.3.3  Parametric  Models  —  For  cases  where  the
time  for  an  operational  element  may  have  a  range  of
values   that   are   dependent   on   recipe   specifications,
theoretical  time  is  best  represented  by  a  parametric
model.      Parametric      models      for      representing
semiconductor     operations     may     be     based     on
mathematical  formulas,  e.g.,  implant  time  versus  beam
current, and/or “lookup” tables, e.g., best observed etch
time vs. etch end point.
R1-3.3.3.1    For  the  photolithography  example,  one  of
the  recipe  parameters  is  the  exposure  energy  (EE).
Given the ideal or theoretical lamp intensity (LI) of the
stepper,  the  theoretical  duration  per  exposure  (THT
EX
)
for the recipe may be calculated as THT
EX
= EE / LI .</p><p>SEMI E79-0304 © SEMI 1999, 2004 22

processing  diversity,  or  a  combination  of  operating
modes and process diversity.
R2-1.2.1          Determine     the     value-added     in-process
theoretical production time per unit (VTHT) – (time per
unit)   for   all   recipes   involved.   This   information   is
required for determining IEE. See Table A2-1.
R2-1.2.2  For assessment     of     operating     modes,
experiments should examine only a single typical recipe
that   is   likely   to   be   used   most   frequently.   Each
experiment  should  examine  a  separate  operating  mode,
where   examples   of   various   equipment   operational
modes may be as follows:
One  wafer  at  a  time  mode  (production  monitor
wafer).</p><p>One batch is run, then the tool stops.
Two batches are run, then the tool stops.
Three batches are run, then the tool stops.</p><p>Continuous  (cascade)  mode.  A  larger  number  of
batches is run, then the tool stops.
R2-1.2.3    For  assessment  of  process  diversity,  select  a
limited  number  of  representative  recipes  that  will  be
processed  by  a  tool.  This  population  should  include  at
least  one  recipe  representing  the  minimum  expected
processing duration and one representing the maximum.
R2-1.2.4      Each   experiment   should   be   designed   and
executed   to   eliminate   rate   efficiency   losses   to   the
greatest   extent   possible.   It   is   further   assumed   that
quality    efficiency    losses    are    zero.    Under    this
approximation,  (VA-OEE) = (OEE)
◊ (IEE).
R2-1.3  Step    2:    Execute    Process    Experiments    ó
Perform   process   experiments   recording   all   relevant
input  variables  including  the  configuration  of  lots  and
wafers,  and  recipes.  For  each  experiment,  record  the
elapsed  production  time  using  convenient  means,  e.g.,
stopwatch or existing data acquisition system.
R2-1.4  Step 3: Calculate Results ó Calculate IEE and
throughput  for  each  experiment.    IEE  may  be  used  to
measure  the  effect  of  non-value-added  overhead  time
during equipment processing. Approximately:</p><p>Intrinsic Equipment Efficiency (IEE)
= (Value-Added In-Process Theoretical Time)
/(Non-Value-Added Overhead  Time</p><ul><li>Value-Added In-Process Theoretical Time)
R2-1.4.1  Hence, non-value-added  overhead  time  for
each experiment may be calculated as:
Non-Value-Added Overhead Time
= [(Production Time)</li></ul><ul><li>( Value-Added In-Process Theoretical Time)]
R2-1.4.2      It   should   be   the   focus   of   efforts   by   the
equipment   supplier   and   the   end-user   to   reduce   or
eliminate   non-value-added   overhead   time   through
improved   equipment   design,   including   scheduling
software,  as  well  as  hardware  components  (carrier  and
wafer    handling    systems,    valves,    pumps,    heaters,
coolers, etc.).
R2-1.4.3    Results  may  be  shown  in  either  tabular  form
or  plotted  graphically  on  a  Productivity  Effectiveness
Plane. See Section R2-2.</li></ul><p>SEMI E79-0304 © SEMI 1999, 2004 23

R2-2.1    It  is  recognized  that  OEE  and  throughput  are
separate   metrics   whose   relationship   may   not   be
straightforward.    Because  theoretical  production  time
per  unit  may  vary  widely  by  recipe,  good  throughput
performance  may  not  indicate  correspondingly  good
performance  in  terms  of  overall  equipment  efficiency.
Similarly,  a  high  OEE  score  may  not  be  indicative  of
high throughput. Given this disparity, it is essential that
both  metrics  be  analyzed  and  compared  as  separate
entities.
R2-2.2    Data  from  rapid  characterization  experiments
may   be   displayed   graphically   on   a   Productivity
Effectiveness Plane (PEP) diagram, Figure R2-1.
R2-2.3  In PEP diagrams, IEE is plotted as a function of
throughput.  Points  that  appear  further  to  the  right  have
higher throughput and points that appear higher up have
higher  IEE.  It  is  desired  to  have  combined  equipment
and  process  designs  whose  performance  would  appear
in  the  upper  right  quadrant  of  the  plane  for  the  entire
operating range of the tool.
R2-2.4    The  four  experimental  data  points  from  the
sample  problem  are  plotted  in  Figure  R2-1  and,  when
connected,  appear  to  approximate  an  upward  sloping
curve. This curve is referred to as a tool signature.
R2-2.5    Tool  signatures  may  be  used  to  describe  tool
performance    relative    to    isolated    variables.    This
representation   helps   equipment   suppliers   and   users
visualize the effects of tool operating modes on IEE and
throughput.    For    more    complex    multi-dimensional
experiment  sets,  the  tool  signature  would  appear  as  a
hyper-surface.
R2-2.6  OEE can be plotted for comparison against tool
signatures.  In  Figure  R2-1,  an  OEE  measurement  of  a
typical  week  is  plotted.  For  the  known  throughput
corresponding  to  this  OEE  score,  the  value  of  IEE  on
the tool signature for the same throughput may be used
to  approximate  the  IEE  score  for  the  week  without
calculating IEE explicitly.</p><p>SEMI E79-0304 © SEMI 1999, 2004 24</p><p>Figure R2-1

TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING ATTITUDE SENSITIVITY OF MASS
FLOW CONTROLLERS (MOUNTING POSITION)
This test method was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility of
the North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards
Committee  on  July  11,  2004.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  September  2004;  to  be  published
November 2004.  Originally published in 1999; last published November 2004.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  The  purpose  of  this  test  method  is  to  provide  a
standardized   method   for   quantifying   the   effect   of
mounting attitude on an MFC.</li><li>2  This   document   provides   a   common   basis   for
communication    between    manufacturers    and    users
regarding testing and describing MFC mounting effects.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This procedure describes a method to determine the
effect  of  attitude  (mounting  position)  of  a  Mass  Flow
Controller on flow span and zero.</li><li>2  The  intent  of  this  document  is  not  to  suggest  any
specific  testing  program  but  to  specify  the  test  method
to  be  used  when  testing  for  parameters  covered  by  this
method.  Reference  operating  conditions  represent  the
environmental conditions where the &quot;best&quot; performance
can be expected.</li><li>3  The minimum test described in this document is to
test  one  MFC  in  5  common  mounting  positions  using
Nitrogen gas at 135.8 kPa (19.7 psia) and 308 kPa (44.7
psia).   This   test   method   can   be   used   to   evaluate
additional gases, pressures or mounting attitudes.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  It is not practical to evaluate performance under all
possible combinations of operating conditions. This test
procedure    should    be    applied    under    laboratory
(reference)  conditions;  its  intent  is  to  collect  sufficient
data to form a judgment of the field performance of the
MFC being tested.</li><li>2  The results from this test represent the performance
of the specific device tested i.e., make, model, full scale
flow  and  operating  conditions.  The  results  may  not
apply  to  devices  of  different  manufacture,  model,  full
scale flow or under different operating conditions.</li><li>3  Due     to     manufacturing     variability,     attitude
sensitivity  may  vary  for  the  same  model  of  MFC.  To
statistically  quantify  attitude  sensitivity  for  a  particular
model of MFC, multiple samples should be tested.

6  Summary of Test Method</li><li>1  Gas  flow,  indicated  flow  and  setpoint  data  are
collected  for  an  MFC.  This  data  is  reduced  to  quantify
the  relationship  between  the  flow  control  by  the  MFC
and its relationship to the attitude of the MFC.</li><li>2  This method allows the user to determine the effect
of different mounting attitudes on MFC zero and span.</li><li>3  The   standard   test   is   determining   the   effect   of
changing between attitudes 1 and 2 on Nitrogen. Other
typical MFC attitudes and gases may also be tested (see
Figure 1).
7  Interferences</li><li>1  The  accuracy  rating  of  the  measuring  equipment
shall  be  superior  to  that  of  the  DUT.    Preferably,  the
measuring equipment will have an accuracy that is four
times better than the DUT.  Calibration equipment must
have a valid calibration certificate.</li><li>2  Take   care   when   using   test   instruments   with   a
specified accuracy expressed in percent of full scale.</li><li>3  Installation    effects    on    the    flow    should    be
minimized.    Monitor  pressure  upstream  of  the  DUT  to
ensure   that   flow   variations   due   to   pressure   are
minimized.</li><li>4  Verify   electrical   signals   directly   at   the   DUT
connector  to  ensure  that  the  signals  at  the  DUT  and
standard  agree  with  the  signals  at  the  data  recording
equipment.</li><li>5  All  electrical  measurements  should  be  read  on
devices  with  at  least  4.5  digits  of  resolution.    These
devices must have valid calibration certifications.</li><li>6
All   instrumentation   in   the   test   apparatus   must
remain in a constant orientation except the device under
test.
8  Significance and Use</li><li>1  The  data  generated  by  this  method  is  used  to
estimate  the  effect-mounting  attitude  will  have  on  the
performance   of   a   mass   flow   controller.      It   would
typically  be  used  to  estimate  the  potential  flow  error
caused by using an MFC in attitude, other than the one
it was calibrated for.

11. 1  Follow   the   manufacturer’s   specifications   and
instructions  for  installation  and  operation  whenever
possible.  Note any exceptions in the test report.
12  Test Specimen
12. 1  Allow  all  components  in  the  test  apparatus  to
warm up following the manufacturer’s specification.
12. 2  Take  necessary  steps  when  switching  gases  to
ensure that only the desired gas is in the DUT and flow
standard at the time the test is performed.
13  Preparation of Apparatus
13. 1  Locate   the   DUT   in   the   test   environment   to
stabilize temperature prior to warm up.
13. 2  The  reference  operating  conditions  shall  be  as
follows:
13. 2.1  Ambient temperature ⎯ 21 ± 4 °C
13. 2.2  Ambient   Temperature   Stability ⎯   Ambient
temperature  to  stay  constant  within  ±  1  °C  during  data
acquisition period.
13. 2.3  Gas temperature ⎯ Same as ambient.
13. 2.4  Gas pressure, Outlet ⎯ Ambient Pressure
13. 3  Following  the  conditioning  period  (Section  12.1)
warm   up   the   device   according   to   manufacturer&#x27;s
specifications.
13. 4  Perform  an  adequate  purge  to  ensure  all  previous
gases and atmospheric moisture has been removed from
the system.
13. 5  Leak   check   the   test   set   up,   using   available
methodologies to verify the test system leak integrity.
13. 6  The  power  supply  must  be  sufficiently  rated  for
the device under test.
14  Procedure
14. 1  Open  V1  and  V2.  DUT  and  allow  the  flow  to
stabilize.  Adjust  the  inlet  pressure  to  135.8  kPa  (19.7
psia).
14. 2  Close  the  downstream  isolation  valve  (V2);  then
close the upstream isolation valve (V1), (see Figure 2).
14. 3  With  both  isolation  valves  closed,  and  a  100%
setpoint  wait  until  the  pressure  drop  across  the  MFC  is
dissipated,  ensuring  a  “no  flow”  condition  through  the
MFC.    Dissipation  of  the  pressure  across  the  MFC  is
indicated  when  the  indicated  flow  drops  to  a  steady
state value near zero.
14. 4  Once  the  indicated  flow  has  dropped  to  a  steady
value  set  the  MFC  setpoint  so  there  is  no  power  being
dissipated  by  the  control  valve.    For  a  normally  closed
valve  this  is  0%  and  for  a  normally  open  control  valve
it is 100%.
14. 5  After the electrical output signal has stabilized for
at least three minutes, record the MFC indicated zero in
Table 1.
14. 6  Open V1 and V2, command 100%.
14. 7  After the electrical output signal has stabilized for
at least three minutes, record the actual flow as reported
by the flow standard and the indicated flow in Table 1.
14. 8  Change   the   attitude   of   the   DUT   to   the   next
desired attitude.
14. 9  Close  the  downstream  isolation  valve  (V2);  then
close the upstream isolation valve (V1) (see Figure 2).
14. 10  With  both  isolation  valves  closed,  and  a  100%
setpoint  wait  until  the  pressure  drop  across  the  MFC  is
dissipated,  ensuring  a  “no  flow”  condition  through  the
MFC.    Dissipation  of  the  pressure  across  the  MFC  is
indicated  when  the  indicated  flow  drops  to  a  steady
state value near zero.
14. 11  Once the indicated flow has dropped to a steady
value  set  the  MFC  setpoint  so  there  is  no  power  being
dissipated  by  the  control  valve.    For  a  normally  closed
valve  this  is  0%  and  for  a  normally  open  control  valve
it is 100%.
14. 12  After  the  electrical  output  signal  has  stabilized
for  at  least  three  minutes,  record  the  MFC  indicated
zero in Table 1.
14. 13  Open V1 and V2, command 100%.
14. 14  After  the  electrical  output  signal  has  stabilized
for  at  least  three  minutes,  record  the  actual  flow  as
reported by the flow standard and the indicated flow in
Table 1.
14. 15  Repeat  Sections  14.8  to  14.14  for  each  of  the
desired attitudes.
14. 16  Return the DUT to attitude 1.
14. 17  Adjust the inlet pressure to 308 kPa (44.7 psia).
14. 18  Repeat Sections 14.8 to 14.14.

SPECIFICATION FOR 300 mm PGV MECHANICAL DOCKING FLANGE
This  Provisional  Specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Physical  Interfaces  &amp;  Carriers
Committee and is the direct responsibility of the North American Physical Interfaces &amp; Carriers Committee.
Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on July 14, 2000.  Initially
available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> August 2000; to be published October 2000. Originally published June 1999.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1     This    specification    is    intended    t o    promote
consistent  interface  features  between  Person  Guided
Vehicles and SEMI E15.1 equipment.
2  Scope</li><li>1   This  specification  defines  a  me chanical  standard
for   the   stationary   (equipment)   side   of   the   docking
flange   used   by   300   mm   Person   Guided   Vehicles
(PGVs). This flange is to be mounted to the floor within
the  volume  defined  by  SEMI  E64  at  SEMI  E15.1  and
SEMI E64 compliant equipment.</li><li>2   This  standard  does  not  purport   to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1   This  standard  does  not  define  t he  PGV  (active)
side  of  the  docking  interface  or  carrier  transfer.    The
PGV and the PGV side of the docking interface designs
should    comprehend    the    physical    limitations    of
equipment to which they are being applied.

5  Terminology</li><li>1  Acronyms and Abbreviations</li><li>1.1  PGV — Person Guided Vehicl e (cart)</li><li>2  Definitions</li><li>2.1   carrier  —  Any  cassette,  box,  p od,  or  boat  that
contains wafers (per SEMI E15).</li><li>2.2  cart — A floor based carrier tr ansfer vehicle (per
SEMI E64).</li><li>2.3   docking  —  The  act  of  locating   a  floor-based
carrier  transport  vehicle  for  carrier  transfer  to/from
equipment (per SEMI E64).</li><li>2.4   facial  datum  plane  —  A  vertic al  plane  that
bisects the wafers and that is parallel to the front side of
the  carrier  (where  wafers  are  removed  or  inserted).  On
tool load ports, it is also parallel to the load face plane
specified in SEMI E15 on the side of the tool where the
carrier is loaded and unloaded (per SEMI E57).</li><li>2.5  load face plane — The furthes t physical vertical
boundary  plane  from  carrier  centroid  on  the  side(s)  of
the equipment where loading of the tool is intended (per
SEMI E15).</li><li>2.6   load  port  —  The  interface  loca tion  on  a  tool
where  carriers  are  placed  to  allow  the  tool  to  process
wafers (per SEMI E15).</li><li>2.7   transfer  —  To  either  load  or  u nload  (per  SEMI
E15).
6  Requirements</li><li>1   The  dimensions  that  define  the    universal  docking
flange are listed in Table 1 and shown on Figure 1.</li><li>1.1   The  minimum  length  of  the  do cking  flange  is
defined by 2×w11.  This minimum length is intended to
fit  under  the  shadow  of  the  smallest  possible  width
SEMI E15.1 compatible load port.  The PGV and PGV
docking   must   provide   full   functionality   given   a
minimum  length  docking  flange.    No  maximum  length
has been specified.</li><li>1.2   One  vertical  pin  (labeled  VP  in   Figure  2)  is
intended  to  be  used  for  horizontal  registration  of  the
PGV to the docking flange.  This pin is also intended as
a  feature  for  an  active  mechanism  on  the  PGV  to  lock
on to.</li><li>2  There are three surfaces on the  flange and a verti-
cal  pin  that  can  be  used  as  the  initial  docking  contacts
point(s)  with  the  PGV.    These  have  been  identified  as
surfaces A, B and C and pin VP as shown in Figure 2.
These  features  are  the  primary  load  bearing  features
during the act of docking, no other features or surfaces
shall be used as initial docking contact points.</li></ol><p>SEMI E83-1000 © SEMI 1999, 20002
