The JobType property specified in the inherited interface should be set to TransportJobType for allTransportJob requests. The additional Job Specification properties required for the creation of Transport jobs aredefined in Table 3. The types of machines specified in the TransportJob are AMHS Storage Machines, Fixed BufferProduction Equipment, or Internal Buffer Production Equipment. Each machine type represents a separate case usedin defining the Job Specification for a Transport Job, and these cases are also defined in Table 3.For transportJobs, the inherited ABORTING and ABORTED states may not always result in an immediatetermination of the job and associated activities. For example, transportJobs may involve autonomous transportequipment that operate without persistent communication links to the TransportJob and TransportJobSupervisorobjects. In these cases there may be a time delay before the results of a transportJob makeAborted request can beenacted to allow the transport equipment to reach a known location. In other cases a movement activity must reach astable condition before it can be interrupted. The location of the MaterialContainer associated with the abortedTransportJob is the nearest location where movement can be safely and reliably interrupted.By contrast, if a transportJob is transitioned to the inherited STOPPING state, the location of the MaterialContainerassociated with the stopped TransportJob must be a legal Source for issuing a new TransportJob.

In the normal case, theTransportJobSupervisor will create simple transport jobs for each job specification and return the jobs as a sequence.Subsequently, if one of the simple jobs cannot complete, the other subordinate jobs must be reassessed by theJobRequestor to determine the appropriate corrective action. In this case, the TransportJobSupervisor will notify theJobRequestor of the job failure with the informJobTerminated message and pause the other jobs of the batch-job toallow the JobRequestor to determine its response.

Also note that material can be either product, durables, or consumables. The CIMFramework recognizes the potential for multiple AMHSs within a single factory (e.g., one supplier of interbaymovement and another supplier of intrabay movement). The MES, however, wants to only have to issue a moverequest (move this material from here to there) without regard to whether that transport spans one or moreAMHSs. Therefore, the component supporting material transport requires a single entry point for initiating materialtransport which will be through the Material Transport Manager (MTM).6.4.2 The Material Transport Manag er must be able manage transport jobs carried out by many different AMHSs.To accomplish this, a separate interface for a Material Transport Controller (MTC) is specified. In the simplestimplementations, a single MTM may manage all TransportJobs directly. In this case no separate Material TransportController implementation is needed. If there is a need for delegation to one or more Material Transport Controllers,the Material Transport Manager can register any conformant MTC implementation which supports the specifiedinterface. The low-level interaction of the material movement controllers with the physical equipment (transportmachines, storage machines and ports) is encapsulated within the scope of this component. Note that the componentmanager does not provide lifecycle services for its managed material movement controllers, but instead uses theregistration interfaces.6.4.3 MaterialTransportManager In terfaceModule: MaterialTransportInterface: MaterialTransportManagerInherited Interface: ComponentManager, TransportJobSupervisor, JobRequestor interface MaterialTransportManager : FactoryOperations::ComponentManager,TransportJobSupervisor, AbstractIF::JobRequestor ","{"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 11 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E102-0600 \xa9 SEMI 200019 Description: A MaterialTransportManager (MTM) operates on requests to move material in thefactory.

This related information is included with the MaterialTransport and Storage Component specification to aid the readers in understanding the intent and use of the standard. This relatedinformation was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures on January 14, 2000.R2-1 The concept of Stocker storage via logical partitions has been implemented through the use of theMaterialTrackingLocation concept and interfaces. In the example below, the correlation between Durables andMaterialTrackingLocations are each objects unit attribute. First, the Factory Supervisor sets the Durable unit to aparticular value based on user specifications.

The scheduler uses knowledge of productdemand, equipment and material state, process flows,throughput bottlenecks, operational policy andconstraints, and other information to recommend jobsthat maximize effective utilization of factory resourcesto satisfy product demand and planned objectives.1.2 Increased control over operatio ns requires anactive Scheduling Component that can respond tofactory events and changes in state and dynamicallyadjust the schedules for material processing, materialtransport and equipment maintenance. The SchedulingComponent can react to inventory levels of material inthe factory to adjust priorities to minimize queue sizesand ensure that use of bottleneck equipment is opti-mized to keep WIP inventory levels at desired levels.1.3 The Scheduling Component ca n minimize turnaround time (TAT) by coordinating material transport(for substrates and durables) with processing to reduceequipment idle time. The Scheduling Component cansequence activities to minimize setup time. It can alsorespond to scheduled and unscheduled equipmentdown-time to minimize impact on turn around time. Inaddition to minimizing overall TAT, it can react to thepriorities for urgent lots to move them through theprocess flow in the minimum possible time whileadjusting the schedules of lower-priority lots that areimpacted. 2 Scope2.1 The primary run-time responsi bilities of theScheduling Component are to monitor resource andmaterial state and apply scheduling and dispatchingdecision mechanisms to identify the next activity(dispatching) or sequence of activities (scheduling) forfactory resources. The Scheduling Component includesan interface that supports both scheduling anddispatching. Figure 1 illustrates the interactionsbetween the Scheduling Component and other components of the CIM Framework. This illustrationdoes not reflect all of the many inputs to the SchedulingComponent that are required to provide it with thecurrent status of the factory resources.2.2 As described in this standard, the SchedulingComponent produces activity option and activityforecast lists. These lists are produced by combiningthe factory model and status information from othercomponents with scheduling policies in the SchedulingComponent. For example, the Scheduling Componentcombines data from the Specification Component onhow products are made with status data from theEquipment and Product Management Components togive activity options for a machine.2.3 The Factory Operations Comp onent uses theScheduling Component services to orchestrate the man-agement of machines and production of lots. For exam-ple, when a tool becomes available, Factory Operationsuses the Activity Options list to select the next lot toprocess on the tool. Factory Operations then workswith other components to execute the production job forthe lot on the machine. Executing the production jobchanges the state of lot and tool in other components.These status changes are then used by the SchedulingComponent when it produces new activity lists.2.4 The Scheduling Manager supp orts FactoryOperations by providing an answer to questions like,What is next for this material or resource? Theanswer may be based on evaluation of current or futureconstraints and objectives. Although the dispatcher'soutput takes the form of a decision for the next activityfor the target resource, the interface may also supportmanual scenarios by providing a list of prioritizedactivities from which the decision is selected.2.5 The Scheduling Manager inter face also providesforecasts of future activities projected to occur after thenext activity. By simulating anticipated future activitysequencing and execution timing the scheduler cangenerate forecasts that predict future responses from thedispatcher for subsequent requests. These forecasts aresubject to change as factory conditions change, but theyoffer the best current projection of future activitydecisions.")))}S.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
