shall  be  used.  When  so  specified,  appropriate  sample
sizes shall be selected from each lot in accordance with
ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4.  Each  quality  characteristic  shall  be
assigned an acceptable quality level (AQL) and lot total
percent  defective  (LTPD)  value  in  accordance  with
ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4  definitions  for  critical,  major,  and
minor  classifications.  If  desired  and  so  specified  in  the
contract  or  order,  each  of  these  classifications  may
alternatively  be  assigned  cumulative  AQL  and  LTPD
values.  Inspection  levels  shall  be  agreed  upon  between
the supplier and the purchaser.
10  Test Methods
NOTE   1:   Silicon   wafers   are   extremely   fragile.   While   the
mechanical dimensions of a wafer can be measured by use of
tools  such  as  micrometer  calipers  and  other  conventional
techniques, the wafer may be damaged physically in ways that
are  not  immediately  evident.  Special  care  must  therefore  be
used in the selection and execution of measurement methods.
NOTE     2:     The     crystal     growth     method     (for     example,
Czochralski  or  Float  Zone)  and  dopant  (for  example,  boron,
phosphorous  or  antimony)  used  are  difficult  to  ascertain  in
finished  wafers.  Verification  test  procedures  for  certification
of  these  characteristics  shall  be  agreed  upon  between  the
supplier and the purchaser.
10. 1    Use  test  methods  for  the  specified  quantities  as
listed in Table 1 of SEMI M18.
11  Surface Defect Criteria
11. 1  Minimal   Conditions   or   Dimensions   ó   The
minimal  conditions  or  dimensions  for  defects  stated
below shall be used for determining wafer acceptability.
Anomalies   smaller   than   these   limits   shall   not   be
considered defects.
11. 2  area  contamination  ó  any  foreign  matter  on  the
surface  in  localized  areas  which  is  revealed  under  the
inspection lighting conditions as discolored, mottled, or
cloudy   appearance   resulting   from   smudges,   stains,
water spots, etc.
11. 3  crack    ó    any    anomaly    conforming    to    the
definition  and  greater  than  0.25  mm  (0.010  inch)  in
total length.
11. 4  crow&#x27;s  foot  ó  any  anomaly  conforming  to  the
definition  and  greater  than  0.25  mm  (0.010  inch)  in
total length.
11. 5  dimple  ó  any  smooth  surface  depression  greater
than 3 mm in diameter.
11. 6  edge   chip   and   indent   ó   any   edge   anomaly
including  saw  exit  marks  conforming  to  the  definition
and  greater  than  0.25  mm  (0.010  inch)  in  radial  depth
and peripheral length.
11. 7  hand scribe mark ó any mark such as that caused
by   a   diamond   scribe   that   is   visible   under   diffuse
illumination.
11. 8  haze  ó  haze  is  indicated  when  the  image  of  a
narrow  beam  tungsten  lamp  filament  is  detectable  on
the  polished  wafer  surface.  (Under  some  conditions
contamination may appear as haze.)
11. 9  orange peel ó any roughened surface conforming
to   the   definition   that   is   observable   under   diffuse
illumination.
11. 10  particulate  contamination  ó  distinct  particles
resting   on   the   surface,   which   is   revealed   under,
collimated light as bright points.
11. 11  pit   ó   any   individually   distinguishable   non-
removable    surface    anomaly    conforming    to    the
definition and visible when viewed under high intensity
illumination.
11. 12  saw    marks    ó    any    surface    irregularities
conforming  to  the  definition  that  is  observable  under

12  Certification
12. 1    Upon  request  of  the  purchaser  in  the  contract  or
order,  a  manufacturerís  or  supplierís  certification  that
the material was manufactured and tested in accordance
with this specification, together with a report of the test
results, shall be furnished at the time of shipment.
12. 2    In  the  interest  of  controlling  inspection  costs,  the
supplier  and  the  purchaser  may  agree  that  the  material
shall   be   certified   as   ìcapable   of   meetingî   certain
requirements.  In  this  context,  ìcapable  of  meetingî
shall signify that the supplier is not required to perform
the  appropriate  tests  in  Section  9.  However,  if  the
purchaser  performs  the  test  and  the  material  fails  to
meet  the  requirement,  the  material  may  be  subject  to
rejection.
13  Packing and Marking
13. 1    Special  packing  requirements  shall  be  subject  to
agreement  between  the  supplier   and   the   purchaser.
Otherwise,  all  wafers  shall  be  handled,  inspected,  and
packed   in   such   a   manner   as   to   avoid   chipping,
scratches,  and  contamination,  and  in  accordance  with
the best industry practices, to provide ample protection
against damage during shipment.
13. 2  The wafers supplied under this specification shall
be  identified  by  appropriately  labeling  the  outside  of
each   box   or   other   container   and   each   subdivision
thereof in which it may reasonably be expected that the
wafers   will   be   stored   prior   to   further   processing.

1  Preface</p><ol><li>1  These specifications cover two  groups of substrate
requirements  for  monocrystalline  high-purity  gallium
arsenide  wafers  used  in  semiconductor  and  electronic
device  manufacture.  Dimensional  and  crystallographic
orientation  characteristics  and  limits  on  surface  defects
are the only standardized properties set forth below.</li><li>2   A  complete  purchase  specifica tion  may  require
that  additional  physical,  electrical,  and  bulk  properties
be  defined.  These  properties  are  listed,  together  with
test  methods  suitable  for  determining  their  magnitude
where such procedures are documented.</li><li>3   These  specifications  are  direct ed  specifically  to
gallium   arsenide   wafers   with   one   or   both   sides
polished.  Unpolished  wafers  or  wafers  with  epitaxial
films  are  not  covered;  however,  purchasers  of  such
wafers may find these specifications helpful in defining
their requirements.</li><li>4   The  material  is  Single  Crystal   Gallium  Arsenide

3. 1   Bow   of  a  semiconductor  sli ce  or  wafer,  a
measure   of   concave   or   convex   deformation   of   the
median  surface  of  a  slice  or  wafer,  independent  of  any
thickness  variation  which  may  be  present.  Bow  is  a
bulk property of the test specimen, not a property of an
exposed  surface.  Generally,  bow  is  determined  with  a
test  specimen  in  a  free,  unclamped  condition.  Units  of
bow are generally micrometers or inches.
3. 2   Dopant   a  chemical  element,   usually  from  the
second,  fourth,  or  sixth  columns  of  the  periodic  table
for  the  case  of  III-V  compounds,  incorporated  in  trace
amounts  in  a  semiconductor  crystal  to  establish  its
conductivity type and resistivity.</p><p>2 American Society for Quality Control, 611 East Wisconsin Avenue,
Milwaukee, WI 53202</p><p>SEMI M9-0999 © SEMI 1986, 19992
3. 3  Lot  for the purpose of this d ocument, (a) all of
the     wafers     of     nominally     identical     size     and
characteristics  contained  in  a  single  shipment,  or  (b)
subdivisions of large shipments consisting of wafers as
above  which  have  been  identified  by  the  supplier  as
constituting a lot.
3. 4   Flat  Diameter   the  linear  dim ension  across  the
surface of a semiconductor wafer from the center of the
flat through the wafer center to the circumference of the
wafer   on   the   opposite   edge   along   the   diameter
perpendicular to the flat. (See Figure 6.)
NOTE  4    The  flat  diameter  may  be  associated  with
the  primary  orientation  flat,  with  a  secondary  flat,  if
present, or with any other flat, if present. In such cases,
the  terms  may  be  modified  as  primary  orientation  flat
diameter, secondary flat diameter, etc.
3. 5  Orthogonal Misorientation   in {100} wafers cut
intentionally  “off-orientation,”  the  angle  between  the
projection of the vector normal to the slice surface onto
the {100} plane and the projection on that plane of the
nearest direction. (See Figure 5.)
3. 6  Total Thickness Variation  ( TTV) the difference
between  the  maximum  and  minimum  thickness  values
of a slice or wafer encountered during a scan pattern or
a   series   of   point   requirements.   TTV   is   generally
expressed  in  micrometers  or  mils  (thousandths  of  an
inch).
3. 7   Warp   of  a  semiconductor  sl ice  or  wafer,  the
difference    between    the    maximum    and    minimum
distances  of  the  median  surface  of  the  slice  or  wafer
from  a  reference  plane,  encountered  during  a  scan
pattern.  Warp  is  a  bulk  property  of  the  test  specimen,
not a property of an exposed surface. Warp is generally
expressed  in  micrometers  or  mils  (thousandths  of  an
inch).
3. 8   Edge  Contouring   on  slices   whose  edges  have
been  shaped  by  mechanical  and/or  chemical  means,  a
description  of  the  profile  of  the  boundary  of  the  slice
joining the front and back sides.
4  Ordering Information
4. 1    Purchase   orders   for   gallium   ar senide   wafers
furnished    to    this    specification    shall    include    the
following items:
4. 1.1     Nominal    diameter    (see    applica ble    SEMI
Standard for polished GaAs wafers),
4. 1.2   Thickness  (see  applicable  SEM l  Standard  for
polished GaAs wafers),
4. 1.3  Total Thickness Variation (see  applicable SEMI
Standard for polished GaAs wafers),
4. 1.4     Surface    orientation    (see    applic able    SEMI
Standard  for  polished  GaAs  wafers).  There  are  two
options of flat location for 2&quot; and 3&quot; diameter polished
mono-crystalline GaAs wafers for integrated circuit and
optoelectronic   applications.   They   are   V-Groove   (as
illustrated   in   Figures   1   and   3)   and   Dove-Tail   (as
illustrated  in  Figures  2  and  4).  These  designations
describe   the   shape   of   groove   that   can   be   etched
perpendicular to the primary flat.
The   following   are   the   options   of   wafer   surface
orientation:
A. (100) ± 0.5° as shown in Figures 1 and 2
B. For V-Groove option:
(100)  off  2°  toward  the  (110)  plane  which  is  located
between  the  primary  and  secondary  flats  as  shown  in
Figure 3. Figure 5 illustrates orthogonal misorientation.
For Dove-Tail option:
(100)  off  2°  toward  any  of  the  nearest  (110)  planes  as
shown   in   Figure   4.   Figure   5   illustrates   orthogonal
misorientation.

used. When so specified, appropriate sample sizes shall
be    selected    from    each    lot    in    accordance    with
ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4.  Each  quality  characteristic  shall  be
assigned  an  acceptable  quality  level  (AQL)  or  lot  total
percent  defective  (LTPD)  value  in  accordance  with
ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4  definitions  for  critical,  major  and
minor  classifications.  If  desired  and  so  specified  in  the
contract  or  order,  each  of  these  classifications  may
alternatively  be  assigned  cumulative  AQL  or  LTPD
values.  Inspection  levels  shall  be  agreed  upon  between
the supplier and the purchaser.

11  Certification</li><li>1   Upon  request  of  the  purchaser   in  the  contract  or
order,  a  manufacturer’s  or  supplier’s  certification  that
the material was manufactured and tested in accordance
with this specification together, with a report of the test
results, shall be furnished at the time of shipment.</li><li>2  In the interest of controlling in spection costs, the
supplier  and  the  purchaser  may  agree  that  the  material</li></ol><p>SEMI M9-0999 © SEMI 1986, 19994
shall   be   certified   as   “capable   of   meeting”   certain
requirements.  In  this  context,  “capable  of  meeting”
shall signify that the supplier is not required to perform
the  appropriate  tests  in  Section  9.  However,  if  the
purchaser  performs  the  test  and  the  material  fails  to
meet  the  requirement,  the  material  may  be  subject  to
rejection.
12  Packing and Marking
12. 1   Special  packing  and  marking  r equirements  shall
be  subject  to  agreement  between  the  supplier  and  the
purchaser.   Otherwise,   all   wafers   shall   be   handled,
inspected,  and  packed  in  such  a  manner  as  to  avoid
chipping,  scratches,  and  contamination  in  accordance
with   the   best   industry   practices   to   provide   ample
protection against damage during shipment.
12. 2   The  wafers  supplied  under  the se  specifications
shall be identified by appropriately labeling the outside
of  each  box  or  other  container  and  each  subdivision
thereof in which it may reasonably be expected that the
wafers   will   be   stored   prior   to   further   processing.
Identification  shall  include  as  a  minimum  the  nominal
diameter,   conductive   dopant,   orientation,   resistivity
range, and lot number.
12. 3    The   lot   number,   either   (1)   assi gned   by   the
original  manufacturer  of  the  wafers,  or  (2)  assigned
subsequent to slice manufacture but providing reference
to  the  original  lot  number,  shall  provide  easy  access  to
information  concerning  the  fabrication  history  of  the
particular  wafers  in  that  lot.  Such  information  shall  be
retained on file at the manufacturer’s facility for at least
one  month  or  as  negotiated  between  vendor  and  user
after   that   particular   lot   has   been   accepted   by   the
purchaser.

Actual  Primary  Orientation  Flat  Length  depends  on  allowed  variation  in  the  wafer  diameter  and  the  orientation  flat  diameter.    Variation  in
Primary Orientation Flat Length is calculated assuming that the end points of Primary Orientation Flat will have curvature of a circle of radius R
= 0 or R = 3 mm; this circle will be tangent to the orientation flat and also tangent to the wafer circumference.  Calculated nominal linear length
of Primary Orientation Flat (the straight part of the flat) are 44.00 mm in a case of R = 0 mm and 42.90 respectively on a case of R = 3 mm.
B
Actual  Secondary  Flat  Length  also  depends  on  allowed  variation  in  the  wafer  diameter  and  the  Secondary  Flat  Diameter.    Variation  in
Secondary Flat Length is calculated. Calculated nominal linear lengths of the Secondary Flat (the straight part of the flat) are  27.22  mm  in  the
case of R = 0 mm, and 26.25 mm, respectively, in the case of R = 3 mm.

1  Scope</p><ol><li>1   The  purpose  of  this  document   is  to  list,  illustrate,
and     define     various     characters,     features,     and
contaminants  that  are  seen  on  highly  polished  GaAs
wafers    and    present    recommended    practices    for
observation  of  these  defects.  These  occurrences  are
frequently  referred  to  as  surface  defects.  The  defects
and  common  synonyms  are  arranged  alphabetically  in
Section  4,  and  each  structure  is  referred  to  by  its  most
common name and, in some cases, probably origins.</li><li>2   Two  cases  of  surface  preparati ons  are  considered
in this document:  (1) surfaces after chemical polishing,
and (2) mechanically and chemically polished surfaces.</li><li>3   This  standard  may  involve  haz ardous  materials,
operations,   and   equipment.   This   standard   does   not
purport  to  address  all  the  safety  problems  associated
with its use. It is the responsibility of whoever uses this
standard to consult and establish appropriate safety and
health   practices   and   determine   the   applicability   of
regulatory limitations prior to use.

4  Definitions and Descriptio ns of Terms
cell   structure   —   (block   structure):   Malformations
attributable  to  crystal  inhomogeneities  and  that  have
their origins in the crystal growth process.
chips   —   (edge   chips,   peripheral   chips,   peripheral
indents,  surface  chips):  Areas  of  material  mechanically
removed from the surface or edge of a wafer.
Chips   indicate   crystallographic   damage   in   the
adjacent  material.  The  origins  of  some  chips  are  in
the  handling  of  wafers  arising  from  the  physical
transfer  or  placement  of  the  specimen  for  process,
measurement,  or  inspection  purposes.  The  size  of  a
chip  is  defined  by  its  maximum  radial  depth  and
peripheral   chord   length   as   measurable   on   an
orthographic  shadow  projection  of  the  specimen
outline.
apex  chip  —Any  material  missing  from  the  edge  of  a
wafer  having  at  least  2  distinct  interior  boundaries
which form one or more distinct intersections.
chuck marks — Any physical mark on either surface of
a wafer caused by a chuck or wand.
contaminant  —  (solvent  residue,  wax  residue,  film,
mottled  surface,  smudge):    Surface  feature  that  cannot
be    removed    by    the    pre-inspection    (non-etching)
cleaning.
NOTE  Contaminant  may  be  foreign  matter  on  the  surface
such   as   localized   areas   which   are   smudged,   stained,
discolored,  mottled,  etc.,  or  larger  areas  exhibiting  a  hazy  or
cloudy appearance resulting from a film of foreign material.
Solvent   residue:   type   of   film   found   on   wafer
surfaces  after  solvent  evaporation  from  the  surface.
Note:  The  residue  comes  from  either  the  solvent
itself  or  material  that  the  solvent  has  removed  from
the  surface  and  redeposited.    Wax  residue:  film  of
wax  that  migrated  onto  the  wafer  surface  from
several possible sources.
NOTE  The  wax  originally  may  have  been  used  to  hold  the
crystal  in  place  during  slicing  or  polishing.  Excessive  heat
used in mounting or demounting, during lapping or polishing
processes, may cause the wax to polymerize.
crack — Cleavage or fracture that extends to the surface
of  a  slice.  It  may  or  may  not  pass  through  the  entire</p><p>SEMI M10-1296 © SEMI 1987, 19962
thickness  of  the  slice.  Often  cracks  are  caused  by  the
improper handling of wafers.
NOTE  Some  crack-defect  structures  can  be  traced  to  process
related events.
cavity — (void) A vacancy or hole in the wafer.
NOTE   Usually   left   by   dissolved   precipitates   and   Ga
inclusions,   As   disassociation   or   created   by   excess   vapor
pressure.
Dimple   —   Deformation   appearing   in   mechanically
polished GaAs wafers.
NOTE    This  surface  texture  can  be  induced  by  floating  the
wafers during the initial stages of polishing.
Dislocation —  See slip, lineage, pit.
edge chip — See chip.
Embedded   —   abrasive   grains   Abrasive    particles
mechanically forced into the surface of the wafer.
etch pi t — See pit.
film — See contaminant.
flake  —  Material  missing  from  one,  but  not  the  other,
side  of  a  wafer,  whose  sole  interior  boundary  is  one
distinct  line  or  arc  not  exceeding  2  mm  in  length,  nor
projecting  into  the  wafer  beyond  the  specified  edge
exclusion.
gallium   inclusion   —   A   segregated   Ga-rich   droplet
incorporated into the surface structure.
NOTE  Normally caused by insufficient As vapor pressure at
the  termination  of  the  crystal  growth  process  or  by  Ga
complexing with some dopants near saturation.
grain boundary — See lineage.
haze  —  (cloud,  nebula):  Attributable  to  light  scattering
by  concentrations  of  microscopic  surface  irregularities
such as pits, oxides, small ridges or scratches, particles,
etc.  The  light  reflection  from  an  individual  irregularity
probably  could  not  be  readily  detected  by  the  unaided
eye, so haze is a mass effect. It is seen as a high density
of tiny reflections.
NOTE  This type of contamination may occur during slicing,
lapping, or polishing.
lamella — A  special  case  of  the  twin.  A  multiple  twin,
extremely thin and relatively long, which may intersect
more than one plane.
lineage  —  (dislocation  pits,  grain  boundary):    Low-
angle   grain   boundary   resulting   from   an   array   of
dislocations.  This  angle  may  vary  from  a  fraction  of  a
second to a minute of arc difference in orientation from
one   part   of   the   crystal   to   another.   The   array   of
dislocations    will    appear    as    rows    of    pits    on    a
preferentially etched surface.
NOTE    Lineage  can  be  induced  into  the  material  in  crystal
growth   or   in   subsequent   thermal   or   epitaxial   processes.
Lineage   will   be   visible   to   the   unaided   eye   only   after
preferential etching
.
macroscratch —See scratch.
microscratch — See scratch.
microtwin — See twin.
orange  peel  —  (roughness,  texture):    Large  featured
roughened  type  of  surface  visible  to  the  unaided  eye,
occasionally seen on all types of polished wafers.
NOTE    Orange  peel  is  usually  symptomatic  of  a  process
control   problem.   In   the   case   of   chemical   polishing   for
instance,  an  excessively  fast  polishing  rate,  or  nonuniform
flow  of  oxidizer  during  polishing,  can  result  in  orange  peel.
Conversely,   it   can   also   be   caused   by   insufficient   stock
removal.
particulate   —   (dust):   Discrete   particle   of   material
which   can   usually   be   removed   by   (non-etching)
cleaning.
pit  —  (dislocation,  etch  pit):  Depression  in  the  wafer
surface  which  has  a  definite  and  distinguishable  shape,
that  is,  a  place  where  the  sloped  sides  of  the  pit  meet
the wafer surface.
NOTE  Pits can be caused by the various growths or polishing
processes.
Preferential etch pits result where dislocations intersect
the  wafer  surface  after  treatment  with  a  preferential
etch. These pits so formed usually have a characteristic
shape  related  to  the  surface  and  bulk  crystallographic
orientation.
polycrystalline   —   (poly):   Body   of   semiconductor
materials   that   contain   large-angle   grain   boundaries,
twin boundaries, or both.
precipitates  —  A  localized  concentration  of  dopant  at
its solubility limit formed during crystal growth.
probe  damage  —  Any  damage  to  the  wafer  surface
caused by mechanical probing or measurement.
roughness — see orange peel.
saw  blade  defects  —A  depression  in  the  wafer  surface
made  by  the  blade,  which  may  not  be  visible  before
polishing.
saw exit chip —A particular kind of edge chip, found at
the  point  where  the  saw  blade  completed  its  cut  of  the
wafer.  It  is  typically  flat  or  arc  shaped  instead  of
irregular in shape, and can sometimes be confused with
the orientation flats.</p><p>SEMI M10-1296 © SEMI 1987, 19963
scratch — (macroscratch, microscratch):  Long, narrow,
shallow  groove  or  cut  below  the  established  plane  of
the surface, seen either before or after etching. The ratio
of  the  length  of  the  figure  to  the  width  of  the  figure
must  be  greater  than  5:1  in  order  to  be  defined  as  a
scratch.
Macroscratches are visible to the unaided eye under
high intensity illumination.
Microscratches  are  not  visible  to  the  unaided  eye
under high intensity illumination.
slip  —  (dislocation  pit,  preferential  etch  pits,  stress
effect)  (see  also  pit):  Process  of  plastic  deformation  in
which   one   part   of   a   crystal   undergoes   a   shear
displacement  relative  to  another  in  a  fashion  which
preserves   the   crystallinity   of   the   material.   Slip   is
evidenced  by  a  pattern  of  one  or  more  straight  lines  of
10  or  more  dislocation  etch  pits  per  millimeter  which
do not necessarily touch each other.
striations  —  Striations  appear  in  Czochralski  grown
crystals regardless of their resistivity.
tweezer  mark  —  Any  mark  on  the  wafer  caused  by
handling with tweezers.
twin — A body of crystal within the wafer in which the
lattice   is   of   two   parts,   related   to   each   other   in
orientation  as  mirror  images,  across  a  coherent  planar
interface   known   as   the   twinning   plane   or   twin
boundary.

SPECIFICATIONS FOR SILICON EPITAXIAL WAFERS FOR
INTEGRATED CIRCUIT (IC) APPLICATIONS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American Regional Standards Committee on April 22, 2004.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> June 2004;
to be published July 2004.  Originally published in 1988; previously published November 2003.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1    This  specification  defines  and  provides  examples
of  silicon  epitaxial  wafer  requirements  for  integrated
circuit device manufacture.  It is restricted to wafers of
diameter   100   mm   or   greater   with   epitaxial   layer
thickness  less  than  or  equal  to  25  μm.    By  defining
inspection   procedures   and   acceptance   criteria,   both
suppliers and consumers may uniformly define product
characteristics and quality requirements.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This specification covers characteristics of both the

NOTE 1:  Scattering  event  size reported  by  SSIS  will  differ
from  the  physical  size  of  the  object.    The  figure  captions  in
the  examples  highlight  this  fact.    No  useful  method  exists  at
the  present  time  to  quantify  this  relationship  (see  Section
7. 3.3.3)
4. 3.1.1  Discussion  ó  Related  characteristics  include
the following:
• Device  characteristics  that  may  be  affected  ó
critical  feature  dimensions,  lithographic  equipment
focus, gate oxide integrity.
• Detection characteristics used for characterization
ó mound height, diameter at 50% height.
• Discrimination        characteristics        used        for
characterization ó positive height:  10ñ100 nm, or
approximately   20%   of   the   epi   layer   thickness;
diameter:  0.1ñ6 μm; circular symmetry.
• Specification    characteristics    used    for    wafer
qualification  ó  number  per  wafer,  mound  height,
height to diameter.</p><ol start="4"><li>3.2  epi stacking fault ó a two dimensional effect that
results   from   a   deviation   from   the   normal   stacking
sequence  of  atoms  in  a  crystal.    <!-- -->[SEMI  MF154,  SEMI
MF1727]<!-- -->
NOTE 2:  Discrimination  and  specification characteristics are
given in this section to facilitate equipment development (see
Section  7.3.3.3)  and  are  not  intended  for  use  in  commercial
wafer specifications.</li><li>3.2.1  Discussion  ó  Epi  stacking  faults  are  typically
linked   together   into   squares   in   the   case   of   {100}
oriented  wafers,  and  triangles  in  the  case  of  {111}
oriented  wafers.    Most  stacking  faults  are  nucleated  at
the  epi  layer  substrate  boundary,  though  some  have
been  observed  being  nucleated  further  into  the  epi
growth   process.   Faults   are   aligned   along   specific
crystallographic  directions.    For  {100}  wafer  the  sides
of  the  faults  are  aligned  along  &lt;110&gt;    directions.  The
length of a side is typically proportional to the epi layer
thickness and related to the crystallographic orientation.
In  order  to  minimize  the  strain  around  a  stacking  fault
contaminants   may   diffuse   to   these   defects.      Some
stacking  faults  may  have  an  effect  on  the  local  growth
rate  giving  the  stacking  fault  a  three  dimension  aspect.
This   three   dimensional   aspect   changes   their   light
scattering cross section when observed by an SSIS (see
Figures   3   through   7).   Still   more   complicated   are
overlapping  stacking  faults  which  scatter  even  more
than a single stacking fault of the same size (see figure
4).   Other   types   of   defects   may   be   composites   of
stacking  faults  and  polysilicon  growth  which  can  also
appear  larger  than  a  single  stacking  fault  of  the  same
lateral   dimensions   (see   Figures   5   and   6).   Related
characteristics include the following:</li></ol><p>SEMI M11-0704 © SEMI 1988, 2004 3
• Device  characteristics  that  may  be  affected  ó
leakage     and     gate     oxide     integrity,     from
crystallographic changes.
• Detection characteristics used for characterization
ó  side  length  and  depth,  orientation  parallel  to  a
&lt;110&gt; direction.
• Discrimination        characteristics        used        for
characterization   ó   shape,   length   ~   epi   layer
thickness:    1ñ10  μm.  Stacking  faults  may  cluster
(see  Figure  7)  and  scatter  more  than  a  single
stacking fault.
• Specification    characteristics    used    for    wafer
qualification  ó  Number  per  wafer.  Since  certain
types   of   epi   stacking   faults   have   no   observed
impact  on  device  performance  while  others  are
killer defects no number can be assigned without a
clear identification of the type of epi stacking fault
that is involved.</p><p>Figure 1

This is a  mound that does not have the sharp edges of an Epitaxial Stacking Fault, but is not as high as a
Bump.  They are typically sized much smaller in a SSIS than their actual size, but some have facets that
scatter enough light to be more easily detected.  Some people refer to this feature as a hillock which is a type
of mound. The shape can be either circular or square. Magnification 500 times using Nomarski Interference
