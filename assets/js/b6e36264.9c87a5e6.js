A  schematic  of  the  Test  Setup  is  shown  in\nFigure  2.    The  Test  Setup  for  this  approach  consists  of\nthe  Network  Analyzer,  the  matching  network  to  be\ntested  (DUT),  the  load  simulator,  coaxial  test  cables,\nthe  appropriate  adapter  (if  any)  to  connect  the  DUT  to\nthe  Network  Analyzer,  and  the  appropriate  adapter  to\nconnect the load simulator to the DUT.\n8. 3    Prior  to  making  any  measurements,  the  Network\nAnalyzer  shall  be  turned  on  and  allowed  to  warm  up\nbefore the testing is to take place.  This time will allow\nfor  electronics  to  come  to  a  stable  operating  condition\nfor the measurements.\n9  Test Procedure for Determining Load\nImpedance and Efficiency\n9. 1    Two  test  procedures  can  be  used  to  determine  the\nload   impedance   and   efficiency   of   the   matching\nnetwork.    The  first  method  is  designed  for  \u201cL\u201d  type\nmatching  networks,  where  the  losses  are  dominated  by\nthe  loss  resistance  of  the  inductor  that  is  in  series  with\nthe load impedance. For the case where there are finite\nlosses in the shunt capacitor, the capacitor losses can be\nlumped  in  with  the  inductor  losses  without  introducing\nsignificant  error  (usually  less  than  0.5%  for  typical\nvalues of < 0.1 ohms).  Lumping the total losses into an\noverall  series  loss  will  also  cause  a  slight  shift  in  the\nreactive part of the impedance, but the magnitude of the\nshift    is    on    the    same    order    as    the    impedance\nmeasurement uncertainty and can be ignored.\n9. 2  The second method is designed for other matching\nnetwork  types  and  uses  a  load  simulator  to  determine\nthe load impedance and efficiency.\n9. 3  Test  Method  1  for  Determining  Matching  Network\nLoad Impedance and Efficiency\n9. 3.1    This  test  method  shall  be  used  for  \u201cL\u201d  type\nmatching  networks  of  the  type  shown  schematically  in\nFigure 1, where the losses in the network are dominated\nby  the  loss  resistance  of  the  inductor,  RLOSS.    The\nefficiency for this type of matching network is given as\nEff=\nRLOAD\nRLOAD+RLOSS\n(1)\nwhere RLOAD   refers   to   the   real   part   of   the   load\nimpedance   and   RLOSS   refers   to   the   losses   of   the\nmatching network.\n9. 3.2    For  this  type  of  network,  the  real  part  of  the\ncomplex  conjugate  impedance,  Re(Zout",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"),  contains  the\nreal  part  of  the  load  impedance  plus  twice  the  loss\nresistance, RLOSS.\nRe(Zout"),")=RLOAD+2RLOSS            (2)\n9. 3.3    The  load  impedance,  therefore,  is  equal  to  the\ncomplex   conjugate   impedance   less   twice   the   loss\nresistance  (along  with  the  sign  change  of  the  reactive\npart  of  the  conjugate  impedance).    For  example,  if  the\nconjugate   impedance   is   measured   as   3   +   j20   and\nRLOSS  is  determined  to  be  0.5  ohms,  then  the  load\nimpedance is 2 \u2013 j20 ohms.\n9. 3.4    The  efficiency  of  the  matching  network  and  the\nloss    resistance,    RLOSS,    can    be    determined    by\nmeasuring  both  the  transmission  coefficient,  S21,  and\nthe reflection coefficient, S11, in the Test Setup shown\nin   Figure   1.      Note   that   the   reflection   coefficient\nmeasurement,   S11,   is   equivalent   to   measuring   the\ncomplex   conjugate   impedance.      If   the   matching\nnetwork is considered as a test load with an impedance\nequal  to  the  complex  conjugate  impedance,  then  the\nloss  resistance  is  found  by  measuring  the  efficiency  of\nthe test load.  This efficiency, Effm, can be expressed as\nEffm=\nRe(\nZout",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},")\u2212RLOSS\nRe(Zout"),")\n(3)\nwhere   Re(Zout",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},")   is   the   real   part   of   the   complex\nconjugate   load   impedance,   Zout"),".      The   measured\nefficiency, Effm,  can  be  determined  from  the  S21  and\nS11  measurements  (as  shown  later  in  this  section).\nThus,  the  measurements  of  Re(Zout",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},")  and  Effm  can  be\nused to determine RLOSS as\n)1("),")Re(EffmZoutRLOSS\u2212\xd7=             (4)\nand  the  load  impedance  and  power  efficiency  of  the\nmatching network can then be determined from\nEffc=\nRe(Zout",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},")\u22122RLOSS\nRe(Zout"),")\u2212RLOSS\n(5)"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E115-0302\nE\n\xa9 SEMI 2002 4\nRLOAD=Re(Zout*)\u22122RLOSS            (6)"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"XLOAD=\u2212Im(Zout",(0,o.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},")                        (7)\nwhere Effc  is  the  calculated  power  efficiency  based  on\nthe measurement of Re(Zout"),") and Effm, RLOAD is the\nreal  part  of  the  load  impedance,  and  XLOAD  is  the\nimaginary part of the load impedance.\n9. 3.5    Calibrate  the  Network  Analyzer  at  the  desired\noperating  frequency  (e.g.,  13.56  MHz).    The  Network\nAnalyzer    shall    be    calibrated    for    measuring    the\nreflection  coefficient  at  test  Port  1  and  for  measuring\nthe transmission coefficient at test Port 2 (see Figure 1)\nusing  the  calibration  kit  provided  with  the  Network\nAnalyzer.    This  measurement  requires  measuring  the\nS11  and  S21  S-parameters  and  requires  a  full  2-port\ncalibration.  The calibration shall be performed at fixed\nfrequency    (continuous-wave    operation)    using    the\nlowest  bandwidth  possible  (typically  10  Hz).    The\ncalibration for each port shall include the additional test\ncables and any additional adapters.\n9. 3.6    After  calibration  of  the  Network  Analyzer,  the\ncable connected to Port 1 of the Network Analyzer shall\nbe  connected  to  the  output  of  the  DUT.    The  cable\nconnected  to  Port  2  of  the  Network  Analyzer  shall  be\nconnected to the input of the DUT.\n9. 3.7    The  tuning  elements  shall  be  moved  to  their\nminimum positions before the measurement is initiated.\nAfter  all  connections  are  visually  inspected  for  proper\ncontact  and  the  Network  Analyzer  has  stabilized,  the\nvalue of the complex conjugate impedance (Zout*), the\nmagnitude  of  the  reflection  coefficient  (S11),  and  the\nmagnitude of the transmission coefficient (S21) shall be\nrecorded.\n9. 3.8  The efficiency when the DUT is viewed as a test\nload, Effm,  is  determined  from  both  the  reflection  and\ntransmission    coefficients.    The    efficiency    can    be\ncalculated  by  taking  the  ratio  of  the  output  power\ndivided  by  the  input  power.

This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot on November 27, 2001.\nR1-1  Types of Load Simulators\nR1-1.1    Load  Simulators  are  used  to  present  a  known\nload  impedance  to  a  matching  network.    One  example\nof a Load Simulator would be a matching network used\nin reverse.  This section will describe a Load Simulator\nthat  can  be  used  with  typical  matching  networks  that\noperate at 13.56 MHz with capacitive load impedances.\nThese   applications   include   those   networks   used   in\nparallel-plate  capacitively  coupled  plasmas  and  also\nthose  networks  used  in  wafer  bias  applications,  where\nthe   plasma   is   mostly   sustained   by   another   power\nsource,  such  as  an  inductively  coupled  plasma  or  a\nmicrowave ECR (electron cyclotron resonance) plasma.\nR1-1.2    The  typical  impedance  that  is  seen  by  the\nmatching  network  depends  on  the  geometry  of  the\napplicator   (its   capacitance   to   ground),   the   type   of\nplasma  (gases),  the  operating  pressure,  and  the  density\nof   the   plasma.      Typical   impedances   seen   by   the\nmatching    networks    operating    at    13.56    MHz    in\ncapacitive-loading  applications  have  a  real  part  in  the\nrange of 0.5 to 10 ohms and a reactive part in the range\nof  \u201310  to  \u201350  ohms.    If  a  transmission  line  is  used\nbetween  the  output  of  the  matching  network  and  the\napplicator,  the  impedance  will  get  transformed.    The\namount  of  transformation  will  depend  on  the  length  of\nthe transmission line, but in general the effect will be to\ndecrease the real part of the impedance and to decrease\nthe reactive part of the load (make it less negative).  If\nthe  transmission  line  is  long  enough,  the  impedance\nseen by the matching network may even look inductive\ninstead   of   capacitive   because   of   the   impedance\ntransformation.\nR1-2  Load Simulator Design\nR1-2.1  A typical design for a Load Simulator operated\nat  13.56  MHz  uses  two  capacitors  and  a  50-ohm  load.\nA  schematic  is  shown  in  Figure  R1-1.    The  Load\nSimulator consists of a series capacitor, C2, and a shunt\ncapacitor, C1.  The C1 capacitor is in parallel with a 50-\nohm  load.    The  50-ohm  load  can  be  an  input  port  to  a\nNetwork  Analyzer  or  a  high-power  50-ohm  load  that\ncan be used with high-power testing.\nR1-2.2    A  picture  of  a  Load  Simulator  of  this  type  of\ndesign is shown in Figure R1-2.  Two vacuum variable\ncapacitors  are  used,  with  a  copper  strap  connecting\nthem.    The  capacitors  shown  in  the  figure  are  variable\nfrom 8 to 1000 pF.  Additional fixed capacitors can be\neasily  added  to  the  circuit  to  expand  the  operating\nrange.      The   strap   connecting   the   capacitors   adds\nroughly  100  nH  of  inductance  to  the  series  part  of  the\ncircuit for this example.\nR1-2.3    The  impedance  range  for  this  type  of  Load\nSimulator is fairly broad.  A plot of the real part of the\ninput  impedance  as  a  function  of  the  value  of  the  C1\nshunt capacitor is shown in Figure R1-3.  The real part\nof the load varies from close to 50 ohms to around 1.2\nohms  at  a  C1  capacitance  of  1500  pF.    A  plot  of  the\nreactive part of the input impedance is shown in Figure\nR1-4.  The reactance can be varied as a function of both\nthe C1 and C2 capacitances.  A reactance range of \u20135 to\n\u2013100  ohms  is  easily  achieved  for  a  C2  capacitance\nvariation of 1500 pF to 100 pF.\nR1-3  Measurement of Load Simulator\nImpedance and Efficiency\nR1-3.1    The  impedance  and  the  efficiency  of  the  Load\nSimulator can be measured in much the same way as a\nmatching network.

By tracking\nequipment systems in terms of modules that perform tasks, it will be possible to precisely identify the affect of both\nfactors toward overall system performance.\n8. 3  EPT enables tracking to this level of detail by introducing the concept of an EPT module and the concept of a\ntask.    EPT-compliant  equipment  are  required  to  report  events  according  to  a  breakdown  of  equipment  operations\ninto tasks and EPT modules.  An EPT module is an equipment component that affects processing or throughput, and\nis  capable  of  executing  only  one  task  at  a  time.    Examples  of  EPT  modules  include  process  stations,  process\nchambers, wafer handling systems, etc.  A task is a planned and repeatable activity with an expected duration and a\ndefinite beginning and end.  Examples of tasks include the following:\n\u2022 Move wafer from cassette to stage\n\u2022 Pre-align wafer\n\u2022 Align reticle\n\u2022 Preheat chamber\n\u2022 Increase vacuum etc.\n8. 4  EPT-compliant equipment consist of EPT modules that perform tasks.  Thus, the state of the equipment can be\neffectively  modeled  as  a  composition  of  the  states  of  the  EPT  modules.  In  addition,  EPT  provides  detailed\ninformation required for performance tracking by providing the task-level details for each EPT module.\n8. 5  EPT  modules  and  tasks  are  to  be  defined  such  that  each  EPT  module  executes  only  one  task  at  a  time.    An\nexample  is  given  in  Related  Information  \xa7R1-7.    Each  equipment  system  must  have  defined  at  least  as  many  EPT\nmodules as tasks that may be performed simultaneously by that system.\n8. 6  Each  task  should  be  defined  such  that  the  units  involved  (e.g.,  wafers,  substrates,  reticles),  the  EPT  modules\ninvolved (e.g., process station, robot, etc.), and the task type (e.g., \u201cprocess\u201d, \u201csupport\u201d, etc.) are constant throughout\nthe duration of the task. A change in any of the following items should result in the start of a new task or completion\nof current task:\n\u2022 Change in material involved (e.g., arrival of wafer, removal of wafer)\n\u2022 Change of EPT modules involved (e.g., robot moves wafer,  chamber processes wafer)\n\u2022 Change in task type (e.g., purge recipe followed by production recipe)\nNOTE 1:   It is not practical for equipment to define tasks or modules at an indefinite level of detail. It is therefore recommended\nthat in each instance for which the material involved, the EPT modules involved, and the task types are all constant, events for\nonly  one  task  should  be  reported.  Any  further  breakdown  is  not  required  for  EPT  compliance.  EPT  places  no  limitations  on\nsupplemental event reporting within any task. However, these supplemental events should not be reported as EPT events.\n9  EPT State Model\n9. 1  This section defines the basic Equipment Performance Tracking State Model, which is applied to the

The tolerance\nin the horizontal plane is determined by the registration\nand  alignment  feature  between  the  RSP  and  the  load\nport,  as  specified  in  SEMI  E19.3  or  SEMI  E19.4.    The\nRSP shall be loaded and unloaded with its front (where\nreticles are inserted and extracted after the SMIF pod is\nopened)  parallel  to  and  away  from  the  load  face  plane\n(see Figure 2).\n6. 3  Side  Clearances  \u2014  Clearances  C1  and  C2  are\ndefined with respect to the maximum dimensions of the\nfootprint  of  the  RSP  (as  specified  in  SEMI  E19.3  or\nSEMI  E19.4),  not  to  the  rectangular  carrier  envelope\n(defined in SEMI E15). Note that C1 is lateral clearance\nto  the  left  and  right  of  the  RSP,  but  C2  is  a  radial\nclearance from the nearest point of the RSP.\n6. 4  Overhead  Clearances  \u2014  All  load  ports  intended\nfor  automated  overhead  access  must  be  open  from\nabove  to  facilitate  automatic  RSP  delivery.    The  open\nvolume  required  for  automated  overhead  delivery  is\ndefined by a projection of the load port area, including\nthe  area  required  for  C1  and  C2  clearances,  projected\nupward to the top of the equipment.  To allow space for\noverhead  delivery  above  H2,  D1  also  defines  the  open\nvolume. Note that this condition need only be met when\nthe   equipment   is   being   loaded   or   unloaded.   For\nexample, the load port may be formed by a surface that\nextends  outward  during  loading  to  provide  overhead\naccess.\n6. 5  Easement for Overhead Transport \u2014 As shown in\nFigure  1  and  Figure  2,  to  add  clearance  for  overhead\nRSP transport, no part of the equipment may be higher\nthan H2 above the floor along an easement between the\nload  ports  of  adjacent  equipment  down  the  bay.    On  a\nreticle   stocker,   on   inspection   equipment,   and   on\nlithography exposure equipment that  has  the  load  ports\non  the  far  end  from  the  litho  track,  this  easement  is\nbetween  the  load  face  plane  and  a  plane  parallel  to  it\nthat   is   D1   beyond   the   facial   reference   plane.   On\nlithography exposure equipment that  has  the  load  ports\non  a  side  adjacent  to  the  litho  track,  this  easement  is\nbetween  two  planes  parallel  to  the  bilateral  reference\nplane  at  the  furthest  reach  of  clearance  C1  to  the  left\nand right of the set of load ports.  Such tools must also\nhave an additional easement above H6 between the load\nface  plane  and  a  plane  parallel  to  it  that  is  D1  beyond\nthe  facial  reference  plane.    It  is  recommended  that\ntransport  equipment  using  these  easements  have  extra\nclearance     to     avoid     contacting     any     equipment\nboundaries.\n6. 6  Loading Obstructions \u2014 As shown in Figure 3, the\nmaximum  allowable  height  of  an  obstruction  on  the\nload  port  over  which  the  RSP  must  be  lifted  (before\nbeing   set   down   on   the   SMIF   interface)   is   H1.\nExamples   of   such   obstructions   include   alignment\ndevices  and  identification  tag  readers  (as  well  as  the\nSMIF port itself).  In the volume between the horizontal\nreference plane and H1 above it, clearances C1 and C2\nno longer apply.\n6. 7  Load Port Lead In \u2014 The load port must provide a\nlead-in  capability  (in  addition  to  that  required  on  the\nSMIF port) that corrects an RSP misalignment distance\nof R in any horizontal direction.\n6. 8  Adjacent  Load  Ports  \u2014  All  reticle  load  ports  for\nautomated  access  must  be  on  the  same  side  of  the\nequipment.    All  equipment  must  have  at  least  one  load\nport  with  access  for  automated  overhead  delivery.    At\nleast  two  of  these  load  ports  are  recommended  to\nsupport  equipment  throughput.    Auxiliary  load  ports\nintended  for  manual  delivery  may  be  located  on  a\ndifferent  side  of  the  equipment.  On  each  piece  of\nequipment,    reticle    load    ports    are    numbered    in\nincreasing  order  (beginning  with  1)  from  left  to  right\n(as   seen   by   a   person   facing   the   load   face   plane)\nbeginning with reticle load ports in the lowest level and\nthen continuing (from left to right) with any reticle load\nports   at   higher   levels.   Dimension   S   specifies   the\nspacing between adjacent reticle load ports.\n6. 9  As  shown  in  Figure  4,  reticle  load  ports  must\nconform  to  one  of  the  following  configuration  options.\nIf no option is specified, Option 1 is assumed.\n6. 9.1  In  Option  1,  the  load  port  must  nominally  be  at\nH,   and   it   must   be   open   from   above   to   facilitate\nautomatic  carrier  delivery  from  an  overhead  transport\nsystem.  The open volume required for vertical delivery\nis  defined  by  a  projection  of  the  tool  load  port  area,\nincluding  the  area  required  for  C1  and  C2  clearances,\nprojected  upward  to  the  top  of  the  tool.    Note  that  this\ncondition  need  only  be  met  when  the  tool  is  being\nloaded.  For example, the load port may be formed by a\nsurface  that  extends  outward  during  loading  to  provide\noverhead access.\n6. 9.2  In   Option   2   (which   allows   faster   automatic\ncarrier delivery from an overhead transport system), the\ntop  of  the  carrier  must  be  \u2264H2  (2900  for  exposure"))}h.isMDXComponent=!0},5680(e,n,t){t.d(n,{xA:()=>c,yg:()=>m});var a=t(6540);function o(e,n,t){return n in e?Object.defineProperty(e,n,{value:t,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[n]=t,e}function i(e,n){var t=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var a=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);n&&(a=a.filter(function(n){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,n).enumerable})),t.push.apply(t,a)}return t}function r(e){for(var n=1;n<arguments.length;n++){var t=null!=arguments[n]?arguments[n]:{};n%2?i(Object(t),!0).forEach(function(n){o(e,n,t[n])}):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(t)):i(Object(t)).forEach(function(n){Object.defineProperty(e,n,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(t,n))})}return e}function s(e,n){if(null==e)return{};var t,a,o=function(e,n){if(null==e)return{};var t,a,o={},i=Object.keys(e);for(a=0;a<i.length;a++)t=i[a],n.indexOf(t)>=0||(o[t]=e[t]);return o}(e,n);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(a=0;a<i.length;a++)t=i[a],n.indexOf(t)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,t)&&(o[t]=e[t])}return o}var l=a.createContext({}),d=function(e){var n=a.useContext(l),t=n;return e&&(t="function"==typeof e?e(n):r(r({},n),e)),t},c=function(e){var n=d(e.components);return a.createElement(l.Provider,{value:n},e.children)},h={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var n=e.children;return a.createElement(a.Fragment,{},n)}},u=a.forwardRef(function(e,n){var t=e.components,o=e.mdxType,i=e.originalType,l=e.parentName,c=s(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),u=d(t),m=o,p=u["".concat(l,".").concat(m)]||u[m]||h[m]||i;return t?a.createElement(p,r(r({ref:n},c),{},{components:t})):a.createElement(p,r({ref:n},c))});function m(e,n){var t=arguments,o=n&&n.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||o){var i=t.length,r=new Array(i);r[0]=u;var s={};for(var l in n)hasOwnProperty.call(n,l)&&(s[l]=n[l]);s.originalType=e,s.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:o,r[1]=s;for(var d=2;d<i;d++)r[d]=t[d];return a.createElement.apply(null,r)}return a.createElement.apply(null,t)}u.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
