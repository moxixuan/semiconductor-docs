SEMI MF1723-1104 © SEMI 20047 be acceptable, choose sampling points for acceptor,donor, and carbon sample wafers. Cut the samplewafers at the proper points, then analyze for acceptorand donor content by SEMI MF1389 and/or SEMIMF1630, and for carbon by SEMI MF1391. Cut wafersabout 2-mm thick from the ingot for these analyses andprepare the samples in accordance with the methodbeing used. Choose the ingot sampling planappropriate to the type of core being sampled inaccordance with the procedure in Sections 12.6.2 or12.6.3 as appropriate.12.6.2 Parallel Cores  For parallel cores (seeSection 10.2.1), single crystal ingot size is about 10 mmdiameter by about 200 mm in length. Select thesampling points according to the individual segregationcoefficients for the specific impurities so these arerepresentative of more than 90% of the impurityconcentration as follows:12.6.2.1 Segregation Effects  During the growth ofthe crystal, crystallization from the melt, the impurityconcentration in the solid phase is different from that ofthe liquid phase due to segregation.1,2 The differentimpurities have different segregation coefficients,defined as: lsCCK =0 (1) where:K0 = equilibrium segregation coefficient,Cs = concentration of the impurity in the solid phase, inatoms/cm3, andCl = concentration of the impurity in the liquid phase, inatoms/cm3.12.6.2.2 Do not use the equilibrium segregationcoefficient for calculations since it is applicable onlyfor solidification at a negligibly slow growth rate. Forhigher solidification rates, the impurity atoms arerejected by the advancing melt at a greater rate thanthey can diffuse into the melt. The impurity atomsaccumulate in the melt layer near the growth interface,developing an impurity concentration gradient. Theconcentration of this gradient depends on the growthrate, fluid flow in the melt, and diffusion behavior ofthe dopant. An effective segregation coefficient, Keff, isdescribed as: )/exp()1( 000DVKKKK eff+= (2) where:V = the growth rate, in cm/s,  = the diffusion layer thickness, in cm, andD = the diffusion coefficient of the impurity in themelt, in cm 2/s.12.6.2.3 In practice, measure a doping profile todetermine the concentrations of impurities along thelength of the ingot. The zone length, shown in Figure3, is dependent on sample diameter, coil design, andpull rate. After initial determination of the zone length,re-measure it only after changes occur in the methodand apparatus. The doping profile, measured for eachimpurity, determines where the ingot should be cut toprovide accurate impurity values. Sample points shouldbe chosen to be representative of more than 90% of theimpurity concentration. In Figure 3, the zone length ismeasured at 15 mm. If the doping profile indicates thatthe flat portion of the curve is at 12-zone lengths for animpurity, take the sample at 12-zone lengths (12  15mm = 180 mm) from the start of solidification on theingot. Figure 3Zone Length Measurement and Ingot SamplingPoint 12.6.2.4 Ingot Profiling For the type of float zonefurnace, coil design, pull rates, and ingot/core samplediameter used, the effective segregation coefficient forthe impurities can vary. To calibrate the individualzoner parameters and technique used, measure theactual segregation coefficient profile. For example, todetermine the carbon profile, cut an ingot into wafersalong its length, and measure the carbon content in eachof the wafers. Then make a plot of carbonconcentration as a function of zone length. The number

&lt;!-- Page 2 --&gt;

SEMI MF1723-1104 © SEMI 2004 8 of zone lengths required to reach the flat portion of theaxial concentration profile determines the length ofingot that must be grown to achieve an accurate carbonvalue. Figure 4 shows an axial doping profile forcarbon where a 20-mm diameter sample core was zonedto a 10-mm diameter ingot with a zone length of 15mm. The effective segregation coefficient was 0.175.In this case, growing the ingot to a zone length of 12ensures that the maximum amount of carbon has beenincorporated into the ingot. Sampling the ingot forcarbon at a zone length of 12 gives reproducible carbonvalues that accurately reflect the amount of carbon inthe polysilicon sample.12.6.2.5 Slice Locations  Once the concentrationgradient for each element for the individual zonerconditions is established, establish sampling rules foreach element. Boron, with a high segregationcoefficient, has a relatively flat profile. A wafer takenfrom the ingot at 6 zone lengths has a value nearlyequal to that taken at 12 zone lengths. If one value issignificantly higher than the other, a contamination hasprobably occurred, and the analysis should be repeated.Phosphorus, with a smaller segregation coefficient, hasdifferent values at the 6- and 12-zone length points.The midpoint should have a value about 10 to 15%lower than the end point. If not, contamination isindicated and the analysis should be repeated. Carbon,with a very small segregation coefficient, varies greatlybetween the 6- and 12-zone length points. If not,contamination is indicated and the analysis should berepeated. Carbon value at the maximum ingot lengthshould be reported.12.6.3 Perpendicular Cores  For perpendicular cores(see Section 10.2.2), single crystal ingot size is about14-mm diameter with a length determined by the polyrod diameter, about 100 mm. For these ingots,sampling for acceptor-donor content is different thanthe carbon sampling, due to the small segregationcoefficient for carbon. Sampling points are selectedaccording to the following:12.6.3.1 Resistivity Profile  Determine thedistribution of acceptor/donor impurities along thelength of the ingot by plotting a resistivity profile of theingot at 10-mm intervals, in accordance with SEMIMF397. Also profile conductivity type, in accordancewith SEMI MF42, at 10-mm intervals. Due to thesegregation effects discussed in Section 12.6.2.1,characteristic purity of the filament, and otherinterferences discussed in Section 3, the resistivityprofile will differ between laboratories. A typicalresistivity/type profile is established after repeated runson control rods and production samples. Significant inthe resistivity profile indicates point contamination ornonuniformity of the deposition layer. 12.6.3.2 Slice Locations  Establish sampling rulesfor each element based on the resistivity/type profile.The single crystal ingot length is correlated to thepolysilicon rod diameter; take a slice at therepresentative midpoint between the filament and theouter skin of the polysilicon rod. Analyze this waferfor acceptor/donor values in accordance with SEMIMF1389 or SEMI MF1630. For the cross section of apolysilicon rod, these values represent the R/2 location.If the resistivity/type profile has significant variationfrom the standard profile, other locations may besampled to determine the distribution of each impurity.Repeat the analysis for ingots with significant variationsuggesting point contamination. Figure 4Axial Doping Profile for Carbon 12.6.3.3 Carbon Analysis  Since accurate carbonvalues can not be obtained on short ingot lengths,perform the analysis on polysilicon sections that havebeen annealed.6 Take a second perpendicularpolysilicon core sample and anneal it at approximately1360°C for 2 h. Take two 2-mm thick slices for thecarbon measurement in accordance with SEMIMF1391. Take one sample from the pointrepresentative of the midpoint of the growth layer andthe other sample at the point representative of thefilament location. If desired, sample other locations formeasurement of radial distribution. 6 Hwang, L. L., Bucci, J., McCormick, J. R., Measurement of Car-bon Concentration in Polysilicon Using FTIR, J. Electrochem.

SEMI MF1723-1104 © SEMI 20049 13 Calculation13.1 After measurement of the acceptor, donor, andcarbon impurities in the cut wafers, relate these valuesto the levels in the polysilicon by making the followingcalculations.13.2 Parallel Cores  For sampling parallel cores (seeSection 10.2.1) in cases where the filament may bedoped or have a different composition than thedeposition layer, make the following calculation inorder to determine values for the total rod product: tLDftffTRP ACAACAC ..)()( += (3) where:CTRP = total rod product concentration of impurity, inppba for donor and acceptor, and in ppma forcarbon,Af = area of filament, in cm2,Cf = concentration of impurity in the filament, inppba for donor and acceptor, and in ppma forcarbon,At = area of polysilicon rod, in cm2 , andCD.L. = concentration of impurity in deposition layer,in ppba for donor and acceptor, and in ppmafor carbon.13.2.1 This calculation assumes that the depositionlayer is uniform across the diameter of the polysiliconrod. Verify this assumption by taking sufficient coresamples to cover the entire deposition layer.13.3 Perpendicular Cores  For samplingperpendicular cores (see Section 10.2.2) where ingotshave been grown as in Section 12.6.3, make thefollowing calculation in order to determine values forthe total rod product.13.3.1 Correlate the single crystal ingot length to thepolysilicon rod cross section as shown in Figure 5. Azone length is related to a cross section area. Boron,with a large segregation coefficient, is assumed to havean even distribution throughout the entire cross section.Phosphorus, with a smaller segregation coefficient,needs to be corrected for segregation factor for eachzone length across the cross section. Determine theeffective segregation coefficient for phosphorus, basedon repeated measurements of control rods for a specificsample diameter, coil design, and pull rate.NOTE 3: At one laboratory, segregation factors, based on aneffective segregation factor of 0.5, were calculated for thezone lengths of Figure 5 as shown in Table 1.

Then calculate theconcentrations in the total rod product from Equation 4using the corrected concentrations at each location inthe rod.13.3.4 Obtain the bulk phosphorus value by photolumi-nescence measurement at the midpoint between thefilament and the outer skin.13.3.5 Calculate the phosphorus concentrations fromeach point of the resistivity profile measurement of12.6.3.1 using the following equation: As-AlB85P ++= (5) where:P = calculated phosphorus concentration at the desiredpoint, in ppba, = measured resistivity at the desired point, in Ωcm,B = measured boron concentration at the desired point,in ppba,Al = measured aluminum concentration at the desiredpoint, in ppba, andAs= measured arsenic concentration at the desired point,in ppba.13.3.5.1 This equation assumes that the conversionfactor for phosphorus is approximately 85 in the 100 to5000 Ωcm resistivity range, as indicated in SEMIMF723. Take the boron, arsenic, and aluminum fromthe photoluminescence or FT-IR data (see Sections13.3.2 and 13.3.3). Use these values and resistivity datato calculate the P value for use in Equation 4 to obtainthe volume averaged calculation of phosphorus.13.3.6 Carbon Calculation  Calculate carbonvalues, analyzed as described in 12.6.3.3, according tothe procedure described in 13.2. 14 Precision and Bias14.1 In Section 11, the use of control rod samples tomonitor was discussed. Data was collected for 156control rods, as discussed in Section 11 for monitoringinterfering contamination levels in the sample prepara-tion, etch procedure, and zoner furnace. The rods werezoned in three different growth furnaces, over a 1-yearperiod. All samples were etched by the sameprocedure, using freshly prepared acid for each etchbath. Boron and phosphorus values were measured byphotoluminescence spectroscopy. Carbon values were measured by cryogenic FTIR spectroscopy. Boron wasmeasured at 6 zone lengths of the ingot, phosphorus at12 zone lengths, and carbon at 12 zone lengths. Resultsare shown in Table 2. Precision for the boron andphosphorus measurement, as two sigma, is stated inSEMI MF1389 as 0.002 ppba. Precision for the carbonmeasurement for SEMI MF1391 is stated as 0.02 ppma.Table 2 Control Rod Analysis Using Three ZonersZoner 1 Zoner 2 Zoner 3 Avg. Std.Dev. Avg. Std.Dev. Avg.

SEMI MF1724-1104 © SEMI 20041 SEMI MF1724-1104TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING SURFACE METALCONTAMINATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON BY ACIDEXTRACTION-ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.orgSeptember 2004; to be published November 2004. Original edition published by ASTM International asASTM F 1724-96. Last previous edition SEMI MF1724-01. 1 Purpose1.1 Surface metal contamination is a parameter that isfrequently included in polysilicon specifications such asJEITA EM-3601 and SEMI M16.1.2 This test method can measure the elemental,particularly metal, surface contamination on polysiliconchunks. Values are related to sample weight rather thanarea due to the irregular size and form of the sample.1.3 This surface measurement of metal contaminationis used for monitoring polysilicon production processes,development of new processes, and materialsacceptance purposes.1.4 This test method is used as a standard for definingdetection limits, and quantifying variations and methodinterferences to allow interlaboratory correlations.2 Scope2.1 This test method covers the quantitativedetermination of surface trace metal contamination onthe surface of polycrystalline silicon chunks using anacid to extract the metals from the surface. The metalscontent of the acid is then diluted and analyzed bygraphite furnace atomic-absorption spectroscopy. Withsuitable modifications that are not included herein, thismethod can be extended to analysis of granular andchip polysilicon.2.2 This test method can be used for various rod,chunk, granule and chip sizes, for polycrystalline orsingle crystal silicon, to determine surface metalcontaminants. Since the area of irregularly-shapedchunks, chips, or granules is difficult to measureaccurately, values are based on sample weight. Using asample weight of 50 to 300 g allows detection limits atthe 0.01 ppbw (parts per billion weight) level.2.3 The strength, composition, temperature, andexposure time of the acid determine the depth ofsurface etching and the efficiency of the extraction ofthe contaminants from the surface. Less than 1% of thesample weight is removed in this test method. 2.4 This test method is useful for determining the alkalielements, alkali earth, and first series transitionelements, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, iron,chromium, nickel, copper, zinc, as well as otherelements such as aluminum. The recovery of theseelements from the silicon surface is measured as greaterthan 95%, using control standards intentionally addedto the polysilicon surface.2.5 This test method suggests a particular sample size,acid composition, etch cycle, testing environment, andinstrument protocol. Variations in these parametersmay be used, but may affect the recovery efficiency orretention of metals during processing. In practice, thistest method is used for sample weights of 25 to 5000 g.For referee purposes, this test method specifies asample weight of 300 g. This test method includesguidelines to alert the analyst to the interferences andresultant variations in this test method, and includesstandard methods for quantifying and reporting thesevariations.2.6 This test method specifies the use of graphitefurnace atomic-absorption spectroscopy to analyzetrace metals content of the acid extract. Other instru-ments of equivalent sensitivity, such as inductively-coupled plasma/mass spectrometry, may be used.2.7 The detection limit and method variation dependon the efficiency of the acid extraction procedure,sample size, the method interferences, the absorptionspectrum of each element, and the instrumentalsensitivity, background, and blank value.2.8 This test method uses hot acid to etch away thesurface of the silicon. The etchant is potentiallyharmful and must be handled in an acid exhaust fumehood, with utmost care at all times. Hydrofluoric acidsolutions are particularly hazardous and should not beused by anyone who is not familiar with the specificpreventive measures and first aid treatments given inthe appropriate Material Safety Data Sheet.

SEMI MF1724-1104 © SEMI 2004 2 NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior touse. 3 Limitations3.1 The common interferences of absorption spec-troscopy are present in this test method, includingoverlap of absorption peaks, nonlinearity of absorptionpeaks, matrix effects, background noise, interelementinterferences, cross contamination, and instrument drift.3.2 Interferences from contamination due to reagentpurity, cleanliness of apparatus, cleanliness of the room,and handling techniques during sampling and proces-sing are critical concerns. This test method describes aseries of blanks and controls to monitor and quantifythese interferences.3.3 The recovery efficiency of the acid mixture andextraction process must be measured in order tomonitor any interference from this source. Metalcontaminants chemically bound to the surface byvarious treatments or in the bulk of the polysilicon maynot be recovered by this acid mixture. Recovery effi-ciency can be confirmed by neutron activation analyses,or by another test method.3.4 This test method requires a sample sizerepresentative of the lot sample. Since surfacecontamination is not distributed evenly upon a surface,sample size and volume must be chosen to berepresentative of the lot. If the sample size is too small,the sample may not be representative of the lot,resulting in excessive variation in duplicate samples. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI C28  Specifications and Guidelines forHydrofluoric AcidSEMI C30  Specifications and Guidelines forHydrogen PeroxideSEMI C35  Specifications and Guideline for NitricAcidSEMI M16  Specification for Polycrystalline Silicon 4.2 ASTM StandardsD 5127  Guide for Ultra Pure Water Used in theElectronics and Semiconductor Industry1 E 122  Practice for Choice of Sample Size toEstimate a Measure of Quality of a Lot or Process2 4.3 Federal Standard209E  Airborne Particulate Cleanliness Classes inCleanrooms and Clean Zones3 4.4 ISO StandardISO 146441 Cleanrooms and associated controlledenvironments  Part 1: Classification of airborneparticulates4 4.5 JEITA StandardJEITA EM-3601  Standard specification for highpurity polycrystalline silicon5 NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Acronyms5.1.1 GFAAS  graphite furnace atomic absorptionspectrophotometer.5.1.2 PTFE  polytetrafluoroethylene.5.2 Definitions5.2.1 acid blank  a sample of acid used to establishthe background spectrum and trace metal contaminationof the extraction acid used in the procedure.5.2.2 carrousel protocol  the order and function ofsamples, standards, and blanks loaded into the samplingtray of the atomic absorption spectrograph (AAS). 1 Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol 11.01, ASTM International,100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, PA 19428.

SEMI MF1724-1104 © SEMI 20043 5.2.3 digested blank  samples of acid, with noanalytes added, taken through the digestion process andanalyzed to provide a monitor of the analytical processthat includes acid purity, digestion bottles cleanliness,cross contamination, and environment purity.5.2.4 digested control standard  samples prepared toknown concentrations of the analytes to providecalibration checks on the instrument and the digestionprocedure.5.2.5 digestion  holding the polysilicon chunks in theacid mixture at temperature until the surface metalcontaminants are dissolved into solution.5.2.6 polytetrafluoroethylene  an HF-resistantmaterial for sample bottles, lids, and tongs.5.2.7 standard samples  samples prepared to knownconcentrations of the analytes, typically 5 ppbw, 10ppbw, and 20 ppbw to provide a calibration standardand set absorption values for the GFAAS instrument. 6 Summary of Test Method6.1 A standard weight and volume of chunk sample ischosen in order to provide a consistent basis for theanalysis and provide a basis for interlaboratorycorrelation of analytical values. For referee purposes, atotal sample weight of 300 g, taken as six chunks, eachapproximately 3 by 3 by 3 cm, at 50 g each, isrecommended. A minimum of three of the six piecesshould have an outside surface. The outside surface, orskin of the polysilicon rod, is thought to be the mostsusceptible to contamination during the rod removaland chunk processing steps. Choosing a minimum ofhalf of the chunk samples to have an outside surface isassumed to be representative of the lot characteristics.6.2 Making sure to avoid cross contamination, thechunks are loaded into clean PTFE bottles, coveredwith acid etchant, heated in a fume hood and thesurface of the chunks etched. The chunks are removedfrom the etchant, and the etchant heated to dryness on ahotplate.6.3 The dried etchant residue is dissolved by adding 2mL of 5% HNO 3 and 8 mL of H 2O to make a total of 10mL. This extract is then analyzed by GFAAS for tracemetals.6.4 The sample carrousel tray of the GFAASinstrument is loaded with a series of blanks, calibrationstandards, and monitor standards, along with the acidextract samples. The temperature program for thegraphite furnace is optimized for maximum sensitivityand the absorption spectral lines chosen for maximumsensitivity and minimum interferences for eachelement. 6.5 Data from the GFAAS instrument is collected andthe value for each analyte in the lot sample calculated.For each analyte, the digested blanks are averaged toprovide a zero reference. This average value issubtracted from the lot sample value, and the remainingvalue multiplied by the dilution factor to obtain thereported result. The dilution factor is the final volumeof the acid extract, 10 mL, divided by the startingweight of the polysilicon sample.6.6 This acid mixture has a measured recoveryefficiency of 95% or greater for iron, chromium, nickel,sodium, zinc, aluminum, copper, calcium, andpotassium, in the chemically-bound form usually foundon the polysilicon surface, after one etch cycle. Bymeasuring the analytes after a second etch cycle, therecovery efficiency of the first cycle is determined.Recovery efficiencies above 90% are required to verifythe accuracy of the analysis. Recovery efficiency wasconfirmed by neutron activation analyses.6 To ensurethat no analytes are lost through chemical reaction orevaporation processes, digested control standards areprepared and monitored for each analyses.6.7 Contamination from the room environment,apparatus, reagents, sampling techniques, and handlingtechniques is monitored statistically by the absorptionvalues for the digested blanks and digested controlstandards.6.8 The detection limit depends on the dilution factor,instrument sensitivity, spectral response of the analyte,acid recovery efficiency, blank value, and methodinterferences. Instrument and method variations aregiven in Section 14. 7 Apparatus7.1 GFAAS Instrument  Graphite furnace atomicabsorption spectrometer, with sufficient resolvingpower to perform elemental analysis at the sub-ppblevel. A sample tray with selective sampling capabilityis integral to the instrument. A computerized datasystem calculates peak absorbance values, provides theinstrument calibration curve, and reports sample values.7.2 Air Environment  The area for sample collection,acid extraction, and GFAAS analysis must be enclosedin a clean room with a minimum standard of Class 6 asdefined in ISO 146441.NOTE 1: This class is about the same as Class 1000 asdefined in Federal Standard 209E. 6 Maurits, J.

Typically, one 5-kg bag from a lot isselected for sampling. The sample is taken from thisbag, and the surface metals values analyzed areassumed representative of the lot. Statisticaltechniques, such as process capability ratios, are used todetermine actual sampling plans for manufacturingprocesses. A choice of sampling plans is found inASTM Practice E 122. For referee purposes, asampling plan shall be agreed upon before conductingthe test. Contamination during the sampling procedureis a critical concern and must be avoided. 10 Calibration10.1 Prepare calibration and control standards for eachanalyte, according to instrument manufacturer'sinstructions, from commercially-available atomic- absorption elemental calibration standards, at 1000ppm, traceable to NIST Reference Standards.10.2 Prepare a series of calibration and controlstandards for each analyte to determine the instrumentcalibration curve, monitor recovery efficiency of theacid etchant, and monitor reagent purity and purity ofthe environment. Purpose of the calibration and controlstandards is shown in Table 1.10.2.1 Determine a calibration curve for each elementwith a blank and a minimum of three elementalstandards. Dilute the 1000-ppm elemental standards to1-ppm standards (0.1 mL/100 mL in acid etch mixture).Prepare calibration standards of 5 ppb, 10 ppb, and 20ppb by diluting 0.5 mL, 1 mL and 2 mL of the 1-ppmstandard to 100 mL with 18-mL acid etch mixture anddeionized (DI) water. Prepare the standards to providea range close to the suspected concentration of theanalyte. Determine the four-point calibration curveaccording to the instructions of the instrumentmanufacturer. Monitor any changes in the calibrationcurve by checking the linearity against previous runs.NOTE 2: These standards were chosen to provide calibrationfor various samples over a range corresponding to 0.1 to 100ppbw in the polysilicon sample. The use of a 1-ppb standardwill provide a lower method variation for analytes in the sub-ppb range. 10.2.2 Collect the absorption values for the 5 ppb, 10ppb, and 20 ppb calibration standards in a database, andestablish statistical rules to determine any drift orexcessive variation in the instrument readings. Repeatthe analysis if these values exceed the statistical limit.Make corrections in the procedure or instrument if thesevalues continue out of statistical control.10.2.3 Prepare two control standards, at 10 ppb, byadding 10 mL of the 10-ppb calibration standards tosamples of clean polysilicon chunks. Digest thesestandards along with the lot samples.NOTE 3: These standards have a similar matrix to the lotsamples. The analysis of these standards provides aquantification of the variation in metals retention efficiency,instrument matrix effects, and variations due to cleanliness ofapparatus and contamination during handling and sampleprocessing.10.2.4 Collect the absorption values for the 10-ppbdigested control standards in a database, and establishstatistical rules to determine if metals retention andvariations due to method interferences are in statisticalcontrol. Repeat the analysis if these values exceed thestatistical limits. Make corrections in the procedure orimprovements in cleanliness of the apparatus and roomif these values continue out of statistical control.

Two 10-ppb digested control standards To monitor the dissolved metals retention of the method and quantify variations in themethod.Two digested blanks, acid etch mixture To monitor reagent purity and purity of the environment and to provide a zero referencefor the lot sample.Lot samples To determine concentrations of the analytes. 10.2.5 Prepare two acid blanks and digest along withthe lot samples. Measure these blanks to provide aquantification of variations in reagent purity andcontamination that occurs from the room environmentduring processing. Enter the values for the blanks intoa database and establish statistical rules to determineany excessive variation in the current value. Repeat theanalysis if the current value is out of statistical control.10.3 For purposes of interlaboratory correlation andcomparison of techniques, definitions of instrumentvariation and this test method variation and detectionlimit are as follows:10.3.1 Measure the instrument variation by analyzing a2-ppb standard for 15 runs, calculating the standarddeviation of the 15 values, then calculating the 3-sigmavalue for each element. Multiply the 3-sigma value bythe dilution factor to define the instrument variation.NOTE 4: Concentration of standards are chosen based oninstrument manufacturer recommendations for signal/noiseratio and sensitivity values. 10.3.2 Measure the method variation by analyzing aminimum of 30 values for the 10-ppb digested controlstandards. Calculate the standard deviation for these 30values and multiply the 3-sigma value by the dilutionfactor for each element to define the method variabilityof this test method.NOTE 5: Method variation can be reduced by using lowerconcentration control standards and by making improvementsin the procedure, room cleanliness, and acid purity. Theseimprovements are monitored by continually tracking the 3-sigma values for the digested control standards. 10.3.3 Measure the detection limit by analyzing aminimum of 30 values for the digested acid blanks.Calculate the standard deviation for these 30 values andmultiply the 3-sigma value by the dilution factor foreach element to define the detection limit of this testmethod. 11 Procedure11.1 Clean bottles, lids and tongs between analyses.Conduct additional cleaning and analyses of blankswhen using new bottles, when blank values indicatecontamination, and when performing referee analyses.Prepare clean bottles and lids as follows:11.1.1 Rinse three times with DI water.11.1.2 Fill the bottles with 500 mL of the acid cleaningmixture and heat on the hot plate, lids fit loosely, for 6h at 100°C; refill the bottles with the acid cleaningmixture and heat on the hot plate, no lids, for 6 h at100°C.11.1.3 Rinse bottles and lids three times with DI water;11.1.4 Fill bottles with 250-mL acid etch mixture, nolids, and heat at 130 to 150°C until dryness, about 10 h.11.1.5 Dissolve residue with 2 mL of 5% HNO 3 and 8mL DI water; analyze using the GFAAS instrument.11.1.6 Repeat entire procedure if the GFAAS analysisshows contaminants are present in the sample bottles.11.1.7 Triple rinse bottles and lids.11.1.8 Fill bottles with acid cleaning mixture and heatfor 6 h at 100°C.NOTE 6: Other cleaning procedures may be used, but mustbe monitored to prove effectiveness. 11.2 Choose one 5-kg bag of polysilicon from a lot tobe sampled. Deliver the bag to the clean room forsampling. Choose six chunks from the bag as the lotsample. At least three of the six chunks must have anoutside surface. Each chunk shall be about 50-gweight, with an approximate size of 3 by 3 by 3 cm,total weight about 300 g. If the sample must be takenin a location other than the analytical laboratory, sealthe sample in double bags and send to the laboratory.To minimize contamination from the room environmentand the analyst, all sample collection and

A minimum of a Class 6 clean room, asestablished in ISO 146441 (Note 1), is required tominimize interferences from environmental sources. Inthe laboratory, open the double bag according tostandard clean room practice and transfer the chunks toa clean, numbered PTFE bottle and weigh to twodecimal places. Add about 250 mL of acid etchingmixture to each bottle to cover the chunks and seal withPTFE lids.11.3 Place the sealed bottles onto the hot plate in thefume hood and heat for about 60 min at about 70°C.Remove from heat and cool, then remove each chunkwith PTFE tongs, rinsing the surface with DI water intothe bottle. Return the etchant in the open bottle to thehot plate and heat to dryness at 110 to 150°C.NOTE 7: A microwave oven may be used in place of a hotplate to reduce the digestion time required to take to dryness. 11.4 Remove the bottle from the hot plate, replace thelid and leave to cool. Add 2 mL of 5% HNO3 to thedried etchant residue and let stand for about 20 min todissolve all salts. Add 8 mL of DI water, replace lid,and swirl to mix.

Thisincludes the following: Furnace time/temperature profile,  Slit width, Sample injection size, and Wavelength. 12 Calculation12.1 Calculate the results as follows:DFBIM = )( (1)where:M = concentration of analyte, ppbw,I = instrument reading of analyte, ppbw,B = instrument reading of average of two blanks,ppbw, andDF = dilution factor, final volume of acid extractdivided by the polysilicon sample weight = 10mL  sample weight in grams. 13 Report13.1 Report the following information:13.1.1 Polysilicon lot sample identification,13.1.2 Date,13.1.3 Manufacturer, type, and model of instrument,13.1.4 Location of laboratory and analyst,13.1.5 Analyte values in ppbw,13.1.6 Blank values in ppbw,13.1.7 Weight of polysilicon sample, and13.1.8 Confirmation of calibration standards in control. 14 Precision and Bias14.1 Precision  The precision was determined bymaking several analyses of a calibration standard tomeasure within-laboratory variation and by conductinginterlaboratory correlations where polysilicon lots wereanalyzed.14.2 Within-laboratory Precision  Study of within-laboratory variation consisted of daily analyses ofstandards and lot samples over a one-year period usingthe acid mixture, procedure, conditions, and statisticalcontrol methods described in this test method.14.2.1 Variation of the GFAA instrument used wasdetermined by analyzing a 2-ppb standard of eachanalyte for 15 times. The instrument reading ismultiplied by the dilution factor, 10/300. This set ofanalyses was repeated over a period of several months.The standard deviation of this set of analyses representsthe variation due to instrument drift, analyst technique,and room environment.

SEMI MF1724-1104 © SEMI 20047 14.2.2 Method variation was determined by analyzingthe 10-ppb digested control standards over a period ofone year. Instrument readings of concentration valuesare about 10 g/L. The standard deviation of this set ofvalues represents the variation due to metals retentionefficiency, reagent purity, apparatus purity, environ-ment purity, and analyst technique.14.2.3 Lot sample analysis variation was determinedby analyzing polysilicon lot samples over a one-yearperiod. The standard deviation of this set of analysesrepresents the variation due to sampling techniques,contamination during sampling and processing of lots,and the total analytical method variation.14.2.4 The standard deviations in these studies aresummarized in Table 2.Table 2 Standard Deviation (ppbw) Values for aOne-Laboratory Study of Variations for a One-YearPeriod Analyte InstrumentVariationMethodVariationLot SampleVariationSodium 0.01 0.08 0.15Aluminum &lt;0.01 0.10 0.28Iron &lt;0.01 0.10 0.13Chromium &lt;0.01 0.05 &lt;0.01Nickel &lt;0.01 0.03 &lt;0.01Zinc &lt;0.01 0.08 0.13 14.3 Interlaboratory Variation  Interlaboratorycorrelation studies were conducted to test the ability ofthe method to analyze surface contamination inpolysilicon lots at the sub-ppbw level. Each laboratoryused different polysilicon sample weights, acidmixtures, and dilution factors, but all performed theanalyses in clean rooms with high purity reagents, andcalibration controls. All polysilicon samples weresupplied by Laboratory A, with lots chosen to berepresentative of polysilicon with only tracecontaminants, at sub-ppbw levels. No samples with added contaminants were supplied; this correlationstudy was to determine variation at these levels due tosampling, the different analytical procedures, anddifferent laboratory environments. Laboratory Afollowed this test method, while Laboratories B, C, D,and E used variations of this test method and the acidmixture and dilution factor for these laboratories werenot reported. The ability of the method to detect valuesabove the sub-ppbw level is determined by the recoveryof the control standards as discussed in Section 14.2.Requested weights of samples were taken from apolysilicon lot, sealed in double polyethylene bags, andsent to the labs for analysis.14.3.1 Laboratory A and Laboratory B used 300-gsample weights. Five polysilicon lots were analyzed.Detection limits for Laboratory A are based on 3 sigmaof the method variation listed in Table 2.14.3.2 Laboratory C used 200-g sample weights. Fivepolysilicon lots were analyzed.14.3.3 Laboratory D used 200-g sample weights.Seven polysilicon lots were analyzed.14.3.4 Laboratory E used 80-g sample weights. Threepolysilicon lots were analyzed.14.3.5 In each case, the average value and standarddeviation are given for each analyte reported. Valuesless than the detection limit are reported as &lt;detectionlimit and no standard deviation is reported. Resultsare tabulated in Table 3.14.4 Bias  Although liquid standard samples areavailable, no reference materials of contaminatedsilicon are available to calibrate this measurement;therefore, no bias statement is possible. 15 Keywords15.1 acid extraction; contamination; graphite furnaceatomic absorption spectroscopy; metals; polycrystallinesilicon; surface contamination Table 3 Surface Metals Analysis Comparison (ppbw) for a Five-Laboratory Correlation StudyLaboratory Sodium Aluminum Iron Chromium Nickel ZincAverage &lt;0.24 &lt;0.30 &lt;0.30 &lt;0.15 &lt;0.09 &lt;0.24Laboratory AStandard Deviation      Average 0.23 0.27 0.03 &lt;0.01 &lt;0.06 0.09Laboratory BStandard Deviation 0.03 0.04 0.02   0.03Average 0.04 0.02 0.11 0.02 0.02 0.04Laboratory CStandard Deviation 0.01 &lt;0.01 0.07 &lt;0.01 0.01 0.01Average 0.18  0.12 0.02 0.02 0.20Laboratory DStandard Deviation 0.07  0.07 0.02 0.02 0.05Average &lt;0.20 &lt;0.25 &lt;0.10 &lt;0.13 &lt;0.20 0.12Laboratory EStandard Deviation      0.06

Othergrades may be used provided it is first ascertained thatthe reagent is of sufficiently high purity to permit itsuse without lessening the accuracy of the determination.7.2 Purity of Water  Reference to water shall beunderstood to mean Type E-3 or better water asdescribed in ASTM Guide D 5127.7.3 Chemical Polishing Solution  A variety ofchemical polishing solutions exist. Those listed inTable 1 have been found to produce satisfactory results.Table 1 Volume ProportionsFormulation Nitric Acid,(Assay:&gt; 99.7%) HydrofluoricAcid,(Assay:49 ± 0.25%) Acetic Acid,(Assay: 70to 71%) A 6 1 1B 5 3 3C 5 10 14D 5 1 2 7.4 An aqueous, nonionic surfactant detergent solution. 8 Safety Precautions8.1 The chemicals used in polishing etches arepotentially harmful and must be handled in a chemicalexhaust fume hood, with the utmost care.8.2 Hydrofluoric acid solutions are particularlyhazardous and the specific preventive measures must bestrictly observed.8.3 Safety or protective gear should be worn whilehandling these acid solutions or their components. Safety requirements vary, but the essentials are: plasticgloves, safety glasses, face shield, acid gown, and shoecovers. 9 Procedure9.1 Sample Selection  Take the sample for evaluationfrom the crystal close to the discarded crystal portionfound at the last of the solidified crystal. Other samplesmay be specified in producer-consumer relationships.NOTE 1: Determination of the most logical point of sampleselection may be established by inspection of the bottom taperof the crystal. If the crystal has a complete bottom taper, thenthe sample should be obtained from the last point of a fullcrystal diameter. If the crystal has lost zero dislocationgrowth before the formation of a tapered bottom, obtain thesample 1crystal diameter above the point of lost zerodislocation structure.9.2 Orient the ingot to be sliced with either the x-ray oroptical method of SEMI MF26 so that the surface to beexposed is within 5° of the desired plane. Slice a wafer,0.5- to 2-mm thick, from the crystal. Identify ingotgrowth lines on the sample by a mark or a ground flatfor future reference in counting defects.NOTE 2: Defects observed by preferential etching may beincreasingly distorted as misalignment from the majorcrystallographic plane increases. 9.3 Remove the residual saw damage by mechanicallapping and chemical polishing or by chemicalpolishing alone.9.3.1 Wash the as-cut or lapped wafer in a nonionicsurfactant detergent solution and rinse thoroughly inwater. Drying may be hastened by use of a lint-freepaper towel. The surface must be uniformly matte inappearance with no scratches, wax, dirt or water stains.9.3.2 Chemical Polish9.3.2.1 Place the sample in the bottom of ahydrofluoric acid resistant beaker with the side to beinspected facing upward. The beaker diameter needonly be larger than the wafer diameter.9.3.2.2 Pour the room temperature chemical polish etch(from Section 7.3) until the surface of the sample iscovered with about 1 cm of solution.9.3.2.3 Agitate during etching to reduce bubbleformation and surface artifacts.NOTE 3: The polish etch procedure in Section 9.3 describesa facility for evaluation of a small number of samples. Moresophisticated facilities are used in commercial environments. 9.3.2.4 Rapidly dilute the etching solution with waterand flush the solution from the beaker after the samplewafer develops mirror-polished surfaces.

Rapid transfer to fresh polish etch for lessthan 30 s additional etching, followed by rapid flushing of thepolish etch can reduce silicon staining. If necessary, dilutionof the polishing etch with nitric acid flushing with water isalso effective in reducing stains. 9.3.2.5 Dry with filtered air or nitrogen after thoroughrinsing of the polish-etched sample.9.4 Select an appropriate etching solution to decoratethe defects.9.4.1 Refer to SEMI MF1809 to select an appropriateetching solution.9.4.2 Etch the samples to remove an amount of siliconfrom the surface being evaluated, as agreed uponbetween the parties to the test. If no removal amount isdefined, remove 5 to 15 m of silicon from the surfacebeing evaluated.9.5 Evaluate the preferentially etched sample in twostages, macroscopic and microscopic.9.5.1 Macroscopic Inspection  Use a high intensitylight, such as that specified in SEMI MF523, to inspectthe full sample surface. The characteristic patterns ofslip defects as shown in Figure 1 are easily identified inmacroscopic inspection. If evidence exists ofmechanically or handling induced damage orcontamination, repeat Sections 9.3 to 9.5 .9.5.2 Microscopic Defect Counting  Count andreport the density of observed defects usingSEMI MF1810. 10 Keywords10.1 dislocation; grain boundaries; ingot;polycrystalline imperfections; preferential etch; silicon;slip NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties orrepresentations as to the suitability of the standards setforth herein for any particular application.

Thesedefects have distinct effects on essential semiconductor-device manufacturing processes such as alloying anddiffusion.1.2 Epitaxial growth processes are used extensively inthe manufacture of silicon electronic devices. Stackingfaults introduced during epitaxial growth can causesoft electrical characteristics and preferential microplasma breakdowns in diodes.1.3 Epitaxial defects are more clearly delineated withthe use of this destructive etching procedure. Epitaxialwafers may however be classified nondestructively bythis method without the destructive preferential etchingand inspection steps.1.4 This practice provides guidance regarding proce-dures for analysis of crystal defects of silicon ingotsfrom which silicon wafers are cut.1.5 This practice, together with the referencedstandards, may be used for process control, researchand development, and material acceptance purposes. 2 Scope2.1 This practice covers the determination of thedensity of crystallographic defects in unpatternedpolished and epitaxial silicon wafers. Epitaxial siliconwafers may exhibit dislocations, hillocks, shallow pitsor epitaxial stacking faults, while polished wafers mayexhibit several forms of crystallographic defects orsurface damage. Use of this practice is based upon theapplication of several referenced standards in aprescribed sequence to reveal and count microscopicdefects or structures.2.2 This practice is suitable for use with epitaxial orpolished wafers grown in either \[111\] or \[100\] directionand doped either p or n-type with resistivity greaterthan 0.005 Ωcm.2.3 This practice is suitable for use with epitaxialwafers with layer thickness greater than 0.5 m. 2.4 Additional requirements on the material to betested are listed in SEMI MF1810.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address thesafety issues, if any, associated with its use.

The etched surface is again examined underbright light illumination to identify patterns that may berelated to contamination or improper handling. Theimperfections highlighted by the preferential etchant arethen microscopically counted and classified. 6 Apparatus6.1 Safety Equipment and Facility  for defect etchingas described in SEMI MF1809.6.2 Wafer Inspection Facilities and HandlingEquipment  consistent with industry practice andsuitable for use with SEMI MF523. 7 Reagents and Materials7.1 Refer to SEMI MF1809 for specific information onreagents and materials. 8 Procedure8.1 Select an unprocessed, polished or epitaxial wafer,ready for use in the fabrication of electronic devices.8.1.1 Open the wafer container in a particle-controlledenvironment.8.1.2 Transfer the wafer with a robotic tool or anonmetallic vacuum pencil, contacting the wafer edgeor back surface. Ensure that the front surface of theadjacent wafer is not contacted during the removal.NOTE 1: Any contact with the front surface of the adjacentwafer can transfer contamination and generally scratch thesurface.8.2 Preliminary Sample Inspection:8.2.1 Inspect the first sample using high intensity lightconditions as described in SEMI MF523 to identify anysurface imperfections, scratches, or contaminationhazes that may interfere with the etching process orconfound the result. If any of these interferences aredetected, select a separate sample for analysis.NOTE 2: These interferences can generate artifacts that maybe confused with the true defects.8.2.2 Epitaxial Wafer, Nondestructive Defect Counting Inspect epitaxial wafers microscopically inaccordance with SEMI MF1810 before defect etchingto count most of the epitaxial stacking fault defects. &#123;100&#125; &#123;111&#125; NOTE: The orientation of the wafer defines the location anddirection of the line defects.Figure 1Slip Defects as Seen with Macroscopic High-Intensity Light Inspection NOTE 3: Epitaxial defects are more clearly delineated withetching, but that is a destructive process.8.3 Defect Etching8.3.1 Epitaxial Wafers  Etch samples with epitaxiallayers greater than 2-m thickness (as measured bySEMI MF95) with removal of at least 0.5 m tohighlight the crystal defects for quantification. Etchsamples with epitaxial layers less than 2 m withremoval of no more than 50% of the layer thickness.Other removal amounts are acceptable based uponproducer-consumer agreement. (See Note 4.)8.3.2 Polished Wafers  The sample must be etchedwith a removal of 5 to 15 m to highlight the crystaldefects for quantification. Other removal amounts areacceptable based upon producer/consumer agreement.8.3.3 Refer to SEMI MF1809 for more etchinginformation.NOTE 4: Crystal defects become more clearly visible forunaided eye inspection with increased removal, but resolutionof the epitaxial induced defects is reduced with increasingetch times.8.4 Sample Inspection  Evaluate the preferentiallyetched sample in two stages, macroscopic andmicroscopic.8.4.1 First inspect the sample macroscopically underhigh intensity light conditions as described inSEMI MF523 to detect patterns of defects, such as theslip patterns shown schematically in Figure 1.

SEMI MF1727-0304 © SEMI 2003, 20041 SEMI MF1727-0304PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS INPOLISHED SILICON WAFERS This practice was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication bythe North American Regional Standards Committee on December 4, 2003. Initially available atwww.semi.org February 2004; to be published March 2004. Originally published by ASTM International asASTM F 1727-97. Last previous edition SEMI MF1727-02. 1 Purpose1.1 Defects induced by thermal processing of siliconwafers may adversely influence device performanceand yield.1.2 These defects are influenced directly bycontamination, ambient atmosphere, temperature, timeat temperature, and rate of change of temperature towhich the specimens are subjected. Conditions varysignificantly among device manufacturing technologies.The thermal cycling procedures of this practice areintended to simulate basic device processingtechnologies. Oxidation cycles other than specifiedherein, or multiple oxidation cycles, may sometimesmore accurately simulate device-processing procedures.The results obtained may differ significantly from thoseobtained with the specified oxidation cycles.1.3 The geometry of some patterns revealed by thispractice suggests that they are related to the crystalgrowth process while others seem related to surfacepreparation or thermal cycling conditions.1.4 This practice is suitable for acceptance testingwhen used with referenced practices and methods. 2 Scope2.1 This practice covers the detection of crystallinedefects in the surface region of silicon wafers. Thedefects are induced or enhanced by oxidation cyclesencountered in normal device processing. Anatmospheric pressure oxidation cycle representative ofbipolar, metal-oxide-silicon (MOS) and CMOStechnologies is included. This practice reveals strainfields arising from the presence of precipitates,oxidation induced stacking faults, and shallow etch pits.Slip is also revealed that arises when internal or edgestresses are applied to the wafer.2.2 Application of this practice is limited to specimensthat have been chemical or chemical/mechanicalpolished to remove surface damage from at least oneside of the specimen. This practice may also be appliedto detection of defects in epitaxial layers. 2.3 The surface of the specimen opposite the surface tobe investigated may be damaged deliberately orotherwise treated for gettering purposes or chemicallyetched to remove damage.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Material having residual work damage in thepolished surface exhibits visible patterns when theprocedures of this practice are used. Usually, edgedamage, lapping damage, tool marks, or scratches areeasily identified by the location and pattern observed.3.2 Contamination not removed by preparatorycleaning procedures or deposited following cleaning,may become visible after oxidation and preferentialetching.3.3 Slip may be introduced by differential expansion atthe points of wafer support in the furnace boat. Slipradiating from the points of support may be assumed tooriginate from this boat pinch and not be inherent in theunprocessed wafer. Slip may also be caused by largethermal gradients imposed across a wafer by fastinsertion or removal from the furnace.3.4 If the oxidation furnace or apparatus iscontaminated, it can cause extraneous artifacts ordefects.3.5 Striations, helical features on the surface of asilicon wafer, are ascribed to periodic dopantincorporation differences occurring at the rotating solid-liquid interface during crystal growth. These featuresare visible to the unaided eye after preferential etching,seem continuous under 100 magnification, and may beconfused with ring patterns of oxidation stacking faults.3.6 Otherwise identical wafers with different backsurface conditions may yield different results by thispractice.

SEMI MF1771-0304 © SEMI 2003, 20041 SEMI MF1771-0304TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BYVOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE This test method was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication bythe North American Regional Standards Committee on December 4, 2003. Initially available atwww.semi.org February 2004; to be published March 2004. Originally published by ASTM International asASTM F 1771-97. Last previous edition SEMI MF1392-97 (Reapproved 2002).1 Purpose1.1 The technique outlined in this test method is meantto standardize the procedure, analysis and reporting ofoxide integrity data via the voltage ramp techniqueamong interested parties. However, since the valuesobtained cannot be entirely divorced from the processof fabricating the test structure, suitable correlationsshould be performed based on process needs andstructure selection. This correlation should includesample size as well as device geometry.1.2 Measurement of the electrical integrity of oxidesgrown on silicon wafers may also be used in-house as ameans of monitoring the quality of furnaces and otherprocessing steps as well as judging the impact ofchanging some processing steps.1.3 Selection of various edge and area intensivestructures is crucial for isolating the nature of thedefects. Techniques for using such structures to isolatethe nature of detected defects is beyond the scope ofthis test method.1.4 The actual results are somewhat dependent on thechoice of gate electrode. Polysilicon gates have theadvantage of being identical to finished product inmany instances. Even for polysilicon gates, exactresults depend upon values chosen for polysiliconthickness, doping, and sheet resistance. 2 Scope2.1 The techniques outlined in this standard are for thepurpose of standardizing the procedure of measure-ment, analysis, and reporting of oxide integrity databetween interested parties.2.1.1 This test method makes no representationregarding actual device failure rates oracceptance/rejection criteria.2.1.2 While some suggestions for data analysis areincluded in later sections of this test method,interpretation of results is beyond the scope of thisstandard. Any such interpretations should be agreedupon between interested parties prior to testing. Forexample, a variety of failure criteria are included to permit separation of so-called intrinsic and extrinsicoxide failures.NOTE 1: In this regard this test method differs from thatgiven in SEMI M51, which is focused on application of gateoxide integrity measurements, as described in this testmethod, to determine the density of crystal originated pits inthe wafer under test. SEMI M51 also provides a standardizedprocedure for fabricating the MOS capacitors.2.2 The background of this test method is provided inRelated Information 1.2.3 This test method covers the procedure for gagingthe electrical strength of silicon dioxide thin films withthicknesses ranging from approximately 3 nm to 50 nm.In the analysis of films of 4 nm or less, the impact ofdirect tunneling on the current-voltage characteristics,and hence the specified failure criteria defined inSection 5.4, must be taken into account. Since oxideintegrity strongly depends on wafer defects,contamination, cleanliness, as well as processing, theusers of this test method are expected to include wafermanufacturers and device manufacturers.2.4 This test method is not structure specific, but notesregarding options for different structures may be foundin the appendix. The three most likely structures aresimple planar metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS-capacitors) (fabricated or mercury probe), variousisolation structures (for example, local oxidation ofsilicon (LOCOS)), and field effect transistors. This testmethod assumes that a low resistance ohmic contact ismade to the backside of each wafer in each case. For amore detailed discussion of the design and evaluation oftest structures for this test method, the reader is referredto the EIA/JEDEC Standard 35-1.2.5 Failure criteria specified in this test method includeboth the fixed current limit (soft) and destructive (hard)types. In the past, use of a fixed current limit of 1 A ormore virtually ensured measurement of hard failure, asthe thicker, more heavily contaminated oxides of thosedays typically failed catastrophically as soon asmeasurable currents were passed. The cleanerprocessing of thinner oxides now means that oxides willsustain relatively large currents with little or noevidence of failure. While use of fixed current limittesting may still be of value for assessing uniformity

&lt;!-- Page 25 --&gt;

SEMI MF1771-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 2 issues, it is widely felt that failure to continue oxidebreakdown testing to the point of catastrophic oxidefailure may mask the presence of defect tails, which areof critical importance in assessing long-term oxidereliability. For this reason, this test method makesprovision for use of fixed limit failure criteria if desiredand agreed upon by the parties to the testing, butspecifies that testing be continued until hard failure issensed.2.6 This test method specifically does not includemeasurement of a charge-to-breakdown (Qbd)parameter. Industry experience with this parametermeasured in a ramp-to-failure test such as this indicatesthat Qbd values so obtained may be unreliableindicators of oxide quality. This is because a largefraction of the value determined is collected in the laststeps of the test, and the result is subject to largedeviations. Qbd should be measured in a constantcurrent or bounded current ramp test. This test methodis applicable to both n-type and p-type wafers, polishedor having an epitaxial layer. In wafers with epitaxiallayers, the conductivity type of the layer should be thesame as that of the bulk wafer. While not excludingdepletion polarity, it is preferred that measurementpolarity should be in accumulation to void thecomplication of a voltage drop across the depletionlayer.2.7 While this test method is primarily intended for usein characterizing the SiO 2-silicon systems as statedabove, it may be applied in general terms to themeasurement of other metal-insulator-semiconductorstructures if appropriate consideration of thecharacteristics of the other materials is made.2.8 Measurement conditions specified in this testmethod are conservative, intended for thorough analysisof high quality oxide-silicon systems, and to provide aregime in which new users may safely begin testingwithout encountering undue experimental artifacts. It isrecognized that some experienced users may beworking in applications where less precise data isrequired and a more rapid test is desirable. An exampleof this situation is the evaluation of silicon waferquality, where a staircase voltage step providing 0.5MV/cm oxide field strength resolution and a voltagestep duration of 0.2 s has been used. Such testconditions may be specified when agreed upon asadequate by all participants to the testing. Because thedependence of measured parameters upon testconditions may increase as these conditions depart fromthose specified in this test method, it is important thatall parties to these tests use the same set of testconditions, so that their results are comparable.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Since this is a dc measurement, care must be takento make sure that the wafer has a low resistance ohmicreturn contact. This is preferably done with ametallized contact to the back side of the wafer undertest. In cases where testing must be done on capacitorsin diffused wells of conductivity type opposite to thesubstrate, top side contacts carefully designed toprovide uniform, low resistance to all parts of the testcapacitor should be used. A discussion of these designcriteria is given in Standard 35-1.3.2 It is strongly suggested that testing be done with avoltage polarity to accumulate the silicon surfaceunderlying the oxide; positive voltages for n-typesubstrates and negative voltages for p-type substrates.If this is not done, a topside contact to a diffused regionof opposite conductivity type surrounding the capacitor(a gated diode or transistor) should be used to minimizethe problem of uncontrolled voltage drops across theinversion layer during testing. This is an absoluterequirement for testing p-type substrate capacitorsunder positive bias, where sufficient electrons tosupport conduction and breakdown are not availablewithout the n-type region.3.3 Evaluation and control of electrical noise in thecurrent-voltage data taken as part of this test method iscrucial to the proper identification of the failure criteria,particularly the ln J-V slope change criterion defined inSection 9.9.4. Approaches for minimizing electricalnoise in the measurements are suggested in Section 7on Apparatus, and an approach for noise evaluation isgiven in Section 10.3.3.4 Control of the voltage step time may be difficultwhen using automated electrometers in a voltagestaircase regime. While the required 100-ms step timemay be set using a delay in the measurement loop, anadditional, uncontrolled delay may be incurred due toautoranging of the electrometer. The effect is mostpronounced for very low currents, where the measuredvalue is several orders of magnitude below theminimum range set by the electrometer software. Anexample of this effect is discussed in Section 10.3.3.5 The method of probing the device may affect theresults. Examples of possible variables are probepressure and use of a contact pad versus direct contactto the gate.3.6 Use of gate electrode material other thanpolysilicon may mask differences in materials and

&lt;!-- Page 26 --&gt;

SEMI MF1771-0304 © SEMI 2003, 20043 make the material look worse than it might otherwiseappear if polysilicon gates are used. This is because theprocess of forming a gate electrode on an oxide samplemay affect the integrity of that oxide either for better orfor worse. Sputtering or radiation damageaccompanying metal gate deposition may degrade oxideintegrity, while the high temperature annealing andgettering associated with polysilicon deposition anddoping may improve oxide quality. On the other hand,stress arising from crystal formation in the polysilicon,or impurity diffusion along polysilicon grain boundariesmay degrade oxide integrity. Changes of gate-substratework function difference may also affect the breakdownand wearout mechanisms in the oxide. Therefore,potential effects of gate electrode material choice ontest results must not be neglected.3.7 The actual values obtained depend somewhat onthe processing involved in fabricating the test structure.Care must be taken to ensure a consistent processing.3.8 Wafer temperature during testing should be clearlydefined. While oxide breakdown voltages are notstrongly temperature-dependent, the oxide wearoutmechanism is temperature-sensitive, and largetemperature variations might have an impact on results.3.9 Warning  Since the voltage and currentsinvolved are potentially dangerous, appropriate meansof preventing the operator from coming into contactwith the probe tip or other charged surfaces should bein place before testing.3.10 When testing very thin oxides, those 10 nm or lessin thickness, special care must be taken to account foreffects arising from the very high specific capacitanceof these films. These may include voltage drops acrossthe polysilicon gate electrode and the silicon substrate,and high conduction due to direct tunneling.3.11 When using a mercury probe for measurements ofthis type, care must be taken in the preparation andcontrol of the oxide surface. Adsorbed organiccontaminant films may affect the electric fielddistribution in the oxide. Such films may sometimes beremoved with hot SC-1 cleaning solution; a mixture ofNH 4OH-H 2O 2-H 2O. Use of a dry nitrogen purge of theprobing ambient is also recommended to minimizesurface contamination effects. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardSEMI M51  Test Method for Characterizing SiliconWafers by Gate Oxide Integrity 4.2 EIA/JEDEC Standards 1 Standard 35  Procedure for the Wafer-Level Testingof Thin DielectricsStandard 35-1  General Guidelines for DesigningTest Structures for the Wafer-Level Testing of ThinDielectricsStandard 35-2  Test Criteria for the Wafer-LevelTesting of Thin DielectricsNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 hard failure  destructive failure of an MOScapacitor associated with rupture of the oxide film.5.1.1.1 Discussion  This is sensed by an abrupt,irreversible change in the current-voltage characteristicsof the capacitor.

SEMI MF1771-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 4 Figure 1Flow Diagram for Ramp Voltage Test Method 5.1.3.2 These categories have traditionally been usedfor oxides thicker than about 20 nm. For thinner films,care must be taken in their use and in proper derivationof the oxide field strengths as described in Section 10.2.The break point between A mode and B mode failure inthis set of categories is different from the 3 MV/cmgiven in SEMI M51. 6 Summary of Test Method6.1 A flow diagram for the ramp voltage test ispictured in Figure 1.6.2 Record the test specimen ID and other test identity.6.3 Establish the test parameters relevant to the testsystem and to the test specimen. 6.4 A capacitor unit on the test specimen is selected fortest, and an optional pretest of capacitor leakage iscarried out, if desired.6.5 If the capacitor fails this pretest, the capacitor isrecorded as a category 0 failure and a new capacitor onthe test specimen is selected for test.6.6 Otherwise, the voltage on the capacitor is set to 0(if no pretest was conducted) or to the voltage of use (ifa pretest was carried out).6.7 The voltage applied to the capacitor under test isincreased linearly with time at a specified rate, withmeasurements of current made at intervals that mustcorrespond to oxide electric field changes less than amaximum specified value.6.8 The voltage ramp continues until hard failure(destructive breakdown), as defined by one of severalspecified failure criteria, is sensed and stored alongwith the appropriate hard failure criterion.6.9 During the measurement cycle, soft failurescorresponding to predetermined current levels aresensed and stored.6.10 The measurement cycle for this capacitor iscompleted when hard failure is detected or when theupper voltage limit of the test is reached.6.11 After the test is completed (without observinghard failure), a post-test is performed to evaluate hardfailure by sensing current at a low voltage.6.12 The test cycle is then repeated for the nextcapacitor in the array, and this is continued until allunits in the specified group have been tested.6.13 When testing is complete, calculations and cate-gorizing of data is done and a report is generated. 7 Apparatus7.1 Although the test method is independent ofequipment configuration, the use of computer-controlled probing equipment is essential as themeasurement speed precludes manual data gathering.What is included here shall be considered a minimum.7.1.1 Voltage Source and Sink  That is capable ofdelivering/receiving between 0 and ±100 V in the formof an effective ramp rate of 1.0 ± 0.1 MV/cm1/s 1 eitherautomatically or under computer control. If use ofother ramp rates is mutually agreed upon (see Section9.6), it must be established that hardware is available toperform the measurement adequately. This voltagesource/sink may consist of two source-measurementunits (SMU's) with a common ground, or just a singleSMU with a dedicated sink. The voltage source shallbe capable of sourcing at least 100 mA of current.

While the chuck may be connectedto the reference voltage (zero, not ground), lowerelectrical noise may be obtained by connecting thevoltage ramp source to the chuck and measuring thecurrent through the probe connection.7.4 Probe  To contact the gate electrode. Either ahard needle-type probe such as tungsen carbide (whichmay be a single probe or a probe card) or a mercuryprobe may be used. 8 Sampling8.1 Sampling is the responsibility of the user of thistest method. However, if testing is done as part of acomparison or correlation, sampling shall be agreedupon in advance by all participants.NOTE 2: Refer to the appendix of Standard 35 for a gooddiscussion of sampling plan statistics. 9 Procedure9.1 Before the measurement, record the followinginformation for each sample: sample identity, date,time, operator, instrument station identity (if any),average oxide thickness, gate area in squarecentimeters, gate material, oxide type (example thermalversus deposited), structure type, conductivity type (nor p), bias mode (accumulation or depletion), testtemperature.9.2 Establish the test parameters relevant to the testsystem and the sample. These include the voltage ramprate, computed in accordance with the calculation inSection 10.2, and the noise threshold level and in someinstances the ln J-V slope ratio for the hard failurecriterion in Section 9.9.5, both determined inaccordance with the calculation in Section 10.3.9.3 Set the applied voltage to zero volts.9.4 Recognizing that some information on extrinsicdefects may be lost, perform a pretest as follows. If it isdesired not to lose the information on extrinsic defects,proceed to Section 9.5.9.4.1 Bias the gate into accumulation at the voltage ofuse. If the measured current exceeds a value equivalentto 1.0  10 5 A/cm2 (or a current value of 10 nA if thedevice area is at or below 103 cm2), record this deviceas a Category 0 failure and proceed to Section 9.11.9.5 From the starting bias condition (zero if no pretestwas done, or the voltage of use if a pretest was used)record voltage and current. 9.6 Begin increasing the voltage bias at a rateequivalent to an electric field increment of 1.0 ± 0.1MV-cm1-s 1 . Note that other ramp rates may be usedif it can be shown that it does not affect the results, or ifit is agreed upon by all parties to the test.9.7 Record current-voltage data at an interval no morethan 0.1 s between readings, or at least once near theend of each voltage step.9.8 After each current reading, test to see if any of thesoft failure criteria have been met. If so, store theappropriate value.9.9 After each current reading, check to see if one ofthe hard failure criteria has been reached.9.9.1 Check to see if the current has increased to avalue greater than or equal to 0.98 times the compliancelimit of the voltage ramp source. If so, record theprevious voltage level as the hard failure voltage, andset the failure category to 1. Divide the current level atthe previous measurement point by the capacitor area,and record this value as the hard failure current densityfor this unit.9.9.2 Check to see if the current has increased by afactor of 1000 or more from the previous reading. If so,record the previous voltage level as the hard failurevoltage, and set the failure category to 2. Divide thecurrent value measured at the previous point by thecapacitor area, and record this value as the hard failurecurrent density.9.9.3 Check to see if the current has increased by afactor of 10 or more in two consecutive voltage steps.If so, record the previous voltage level as the hardfailure voltage, and set the failure category to 3.

Divide the current value measured at the previouspoint by the capacitor area, and record this value as thehard failure current density.9.10 After hard failure has been detected by one of thecriteria in Section 9.9 or the upper test voltage limit hasbeen reached, perform a post-test using the samecriteria defined for the pretest in Section 9.4.1. This isto be done whether a pretest was elected in Section 9.4or not. If the unit fails the post-test conditions, modifythe failure category in some way to reflect thisobservation. For example, one may change the sign ofthe failure category number, or add an asterisk.9.11 Proceed to the next device to be tested, and repeatSections 9.39.10 until all devices are tested. 10 Calculations10.1 Current and Current Density  To calculatecurrent (I) from a current density (J), multiply thecurrent density by the area of gate contact (A) asfollows:AJI = (1)NOTE 3: Example: Given a current density (J) of 1 A/cm2and a gate area (A) of 0.08 cm2, the current would be 80 nA.10.1.1 Similarly, compute current density (J in A/cm2)from measured current (I in A) and area (A in cm2)using AIJ = (2) 10.2 Oxide Voltage and Electric Field Strength as aFunction of Applied Voltage  Since ramp voltage testincrements and ramp rates as well as some breakdownvoltage data analyses are specified in terms of oxideelectric field strength, it is important to consider theconversion of applied voltages to oxide voltage andelectric field values for these two cases. Historically,oxide electric field strength has been approximatedsimply by dividing the applied voltage by the thicknessof the oxide. This approximation is in error because itneglects the offset in the zero values of applied andoxide voltage brought about by the work functiondifference between gate electrode and silicon substrate,and the voltages dropped across the substrate (and thegate electrode, if it is non-metallic) when the capacitoris strongly biased during breakdown testing. Thesevoltage drops are made up of two components; oneassociated with band bending at the interfaces with theoxide that establishes the high fields required fortesting, and another involving additional voltage dropsdue to series resistances that become significant at veryhigh currents. These corrections, which togethernormally range up to 1 to 2 V in magnitude, mightreasonably be neglected for samples with oxides greater than 20-nm thick, as the correction amounted to only afew percent of the breakdown voltage values. Forthinner oxides, these additional voltage componentsmust be taken into account.10.2.1 The voltage Vapp applied across an MOScapacitor with a given gate-substrate work functiondifference ms and oxide fixed charge Q f may beexpressed as follows: gatesubmsoxfoxapp VVCQVV ++   += (3) where:Vox = voltage across the oxide, V,Cox = oxide capacitance, F/cm2,Vsub = voltage across the substrate, V,Vgate = voltage across the gate electrode (arisingfrom polysilicon depletion or seriesresistance, V.10.2.2 At zero volts applied, the offset due to the workfunction difference and oxide charge appearspredominantly across the oxide. For setting a voltageramp rate, the incremental change in Vox with changingVapp is not affected by this offset, but may be decreasedby voltage increases across the silicon substrate or thegate electrode due to band bending and series resistancedrops. For a sample in which the applied bias voltagepolarity accumulates the substrate, and the gateelectrode is metallic or of the opposite conductivitytype from the substrate (for example, p-type siliconsubstrate and n+ polysilicon gate), these effects areappreciable only for very small and very large appliedvoltages. At low bias, silicon bands bend until thesurface becomes degenerate, after which the rate ofband bending becomes very low. At high biases,significant resistive voltage drops may develop if thetest structure design is not optimized. Over the largestportion of the test in which neither of these effects arelarge, ramp rates may be computed assuming thatvoltage increments applied to the device under testappear completely across the oxide, and Eox, theelectric field increment across the oxide, is given asfollows: oxappox WVE = (4) where:Wox = oxide thickness, cm.10.2.3 For computations of oxide field strengthassociated with the various hard and soft failure criteria,

Figure 2Determination of Noise Threshold Current Level,Slope Ratio Applicability, and Voltage Step TimeVariations 10.3 Determination of Noise Threshold Current Leveland ln J-V Slope Ratio Specification  Useable valuesof noise threshold current level and ln J-V slope ratiodepend upon properties of the test system as well as thesamples to be evaluated, and a preliminary test may berequired in order to specify them properly. To do this,it is necessary to store all the current-voltage data pairsas well as the incremental voltage step time readings indata arrays. This is not required for performance of thebulk of the testing, but is sometimes useful for morethorough analysis of the test results. When such data isstored, it is possible to construct a figure like thatshown in Figure 2, which is a semi-logarithmic plot ofsample current, step time, and slope ratio versus appliedvoltage. Data given here was taken on a 3-nm oxide ona p-type silicon substrate, so the current and voltagevalues are magnitudes of negative readings. Both directand Fowler-Nordheim tunneling components are seenin the I-V data.10.3.1 To determine the noise threshold current level,examine the ln J-V slope ratio, shown as open trianglesin Figure 2. It is seen to be quite noisy for this testsystem and sample up to a current level just below 1nA. This value, 1 nA, is thus a good choice for noisethreshold current level for this test. Further analysis ofthe slope ratio data shows that its maximum value in therange from 1 nA up to catastrophic failure is 1.21, sothe standard specified ratio value of three (3) isadequate to avoid significant noise interference.10.3.2 The step time-voltage dependence plotted aslight squares in Figure 2 illustrates shortcomings in thestep time control for this configuration of themeasurement system. A voltage step time of 0.1 s isspecified for this test method in Sections 5.3 and 9.7.Because of the high, time-dependent currents measured below 0.5 V, there is a regime below 1 V where this isobserved, but most readings from there up to a currentvalue of 0.1 A fall in the range 0.2 to 0.4 s. Also, forhigher current values, there are singular points atelectrometer range changes where 0.2-s delays areencountered. It has been shown (Klema 4) thatdeviations of this amount do not have large effects onbreakdown voltage distributions, but these extendeddelays affect total measurement time, and it would beworthwhile to eliminate them if possible. Approachesdepend upon measurement hardware being used, buttrading off low current resolution for electrometerautoranging time and look-ahead range changing codeare possibilities.10.4 ln J-V Slope Hard Failure Criterion  Hardbreakdown failure of oxides is increasingly difficult todetect as oxide thickness decreases below 10 nm.Fowler-Nordheim emission, the dominant currenttransport mechanism for SiO 2 films in this thicknessrange, predicts that at a given field strength, thelogarithmic slope of the J-V characteristic increases fordecreasing film thickness, but decreases with increasingfield strength for a given oxide thickness. Thus, achange in ln J-V slope may be a more sensitive detectorof failure for these very thin films, where high failurecurrent density, low oxide impedance at failure, andhigh voltage drops in series resistances might lead tovery small current changes when the oxide ruptures.10.4.1 Experience with this failure criterion for oxidethicknesses ranging down to 3 nm indicates that achange by a factor of 3 provides good detection offailure while remaining above the noise level in thedata. Users may verify this condition for theirparticular sample and test conditions, and change thefailure factor accordingly. Any such change must beagreed upon by the parties to the test, and clearlyidentified in the report of the data.10.4.2 In order to minimize noise in the calculatedvalues and optimize the sensitivity of the failuredetection, it has been found advisable to use a set offive data points to calculate the established and newvalues of the ln J-V slope. This illustrated in Figure 3,which shows the last few data points in the rampvoltage test of a 50-nm oxide. Data points are spaced at0.1 MV/cm increments, as dictated by this test method.10.4.3 In particular, the last five data points are labeled(V(n), I(n)) through (V(n  5), I(n  5), respectively.The established logarithmic slope is as follows: 4 Klema, J., Ramp Rate Effect on Dielectric Breakdown, FinalReport, IEEE International Integrated Reliability Workshop (IRW),IEEE Electron Devices Society, 1989, p. 87.

Figure 3Calculation of In J-V Slope Ratio FailureCriterion for a p-Type Sample with 50-nm GateOxide 10.5 Defect Density  To calculate a defect density, aminimum criterion must be chosen by either the user ornegotiated with the user's customer. This criterion cantake the form of a minimum breakdown voltage orelectric field strength, or a discontinuity in thebreakdown voltage distribution of the sample. Giventhe fraction of devices reaching this criterion, the defectdensity calculation may be based on a Poissonrelationship (see Standard 35) using the followingequation:)exp( ADY = (7) where:Y = yield of good units in terms of the definedfailure criterion, A = area of sample, cm2, andD = defect density, defects/cm2.NOTE 4: Example: Given a total of 100 devices tested with87 devices passing the minimum criterion for success and agate area of 0.08 cm 2, the defect density would be as follows:2defects/cm7.108.0)100/87ln( ==D (8) 10.5.1 An undefined condition results if the number ofsuccesses is zero. It may be necessary to change thearea of the test capacitor chosen for testing in order toresolve meaningful defect densities. Figure 4 shows therelationship between defect density and test capacitorarea required for resolution in terms of a minimum of10% good or defective units in the sample.NOTE 5: For example, a test capacitor with an area of 0.1cm2 can resolve defect densities between 1 and 25defects/cm2, with 10 and 90% defective samples.

SEMI MF1771-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 10 RELATED INFORMATION 1BACKGROUND OF METHOD NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI MF1771. It was developed during the originaldevelopment of the document. This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot onDecember 4, 2003.R1-1 OverviewR1-1.1 This is a voltage ramp test. It is most useful indetermining changes in a given process. It is intendedto be applied to arrays of similar capacitors on a siliconwafer or group of wafers representing a processcondition specified by the user. R1-2 Voltage RampR1-2.1 While this test can, and might best be doneusing a true linear voltage ramp, constraints of theautomated test equipment most often used in itsperformance lead to widespread use of a staircase ofvoltage steps to simulate the ramp. The ramp rate isspecified in terms of the rate of increase of the oxideelectric field. For oxides thicker than about 20 nm, theoxide electric field has been commonly estimated bydividing the applied voltage by the oxide thickness, butfor thinner films, significant errors may be introducedby ignoring the effects of non-zero flat band voltage ofthe MOS capacitor and voltages developed across thesilicon substrate (and the gate electrode as well, if it ispolysilicon) due to band bending and series resistance.One approach to estimation of the relationship betweensample parameters and oxide field strength is found inSection 10.2. R1-3 Current SamplingR1-3.1 In order to provide adequate breakdown fieldstrength resolution, it is specified that current readingsbe taken after a maximum electric field change of 0.1MV/cm. Taken together with the specified voltageramp rate, this leads to a maximum time betweencurrent readings of 100 ms. In the case in which thetest is done using a voltage staircase, this implies use ofa 100-ms voltage step duration, with one currentreading taken at each step. R1-4 Failure CriteriaR1-4.1 Both hard and soft failure criteria areprovided for in this test methods.R1-4.2 Techniques for detection of hard oxide failurefor thin dielectrics may require high resolution, lownoise current-voltage data. For this reason, hard failurecriteria are defined in two measurement regimes, onebelow and one above a threshold current level wherenoise is reduced. This current level is commonly in the range 1 nA to 0.1 A for most test systems. Hardfailure criteria below the noise threshold level aredefined as follows:R1-4.2.1 Current greater than or equal to 0.98 timesthe compliance limit of the current score  Thiscondition signals total collapse of the capacitor.R1-4.2.2 Current change by a factor of 1000 in asingle voltage step  Units with gross defects failing atlow voltages where currents are below the noisethreshold commonly fail with very large increases incurrent.R1-4.2.3 Consecutive current increases by a factor of10 in each of two voltage steps  Test capacitors thatare initially highly conductive, as from a pinhole, oftendo not display destructive breakdown, but rather showsteeply rising diodic leakage currents. This failurecriterion is designed to identify these defective units atlow voltage. Above the noise threshold current level,the two criteria above remain in force, and two othersare added, as follows:R1-4.2.4 Current change by a factor of 10 in a singlestep  In the Fowler-Nordheim regime, currentchanges are much less than this value for the smallincrement in oxide field associated with a single voltagestep.R1-4.2.5 Change in the logarithmic slope of the J-Vcurve by a factor of 3  This criterion becomes ofincreasingly great value for oxide films thinner than 10nm, where destructive breakdown is often accompaniedby very small changes in current, because of the verylow resistance of these oxides at very high fields (seeStandard 35-2).R1-4.3 Another parameter associated with hard failureis the hard failure current density, defined as the valueof the current at the last measurement point prior todetection of hard failure, divided by the area of thecapacitor.R1-4.4 Soft failures are associated with the passage ofa predetermined current through the capacitor undertest. This type of criterion has been traditionally used,since in the past, passage of any measurable currentthrough an oxide was normally associated with hardfailure. More recently, where oxides have commonlybeen capable of sustaining Fowler-Nordheim tunnelingconduction, use of such a criterion yields resultsindicative of the uniformity of the samples being tested.

SEMI MF1771-0304 © SEMI 2003, 200411 As such, soft failure criteria may be agreed uponbetween users of this test method in order to meetindividual needs of the testing. Following are examplesof commonly used criteria:R1-4.4.1 Vcrit  The voltage associated with the noisethreshold current level.R1-4.4.2 Vsoft fail = V at J = 100 mA/cm 2  Formany oxides, this current level is close to hard failure, but avoids the dispersion associated with highresistance voltage drops at high breakdown currents.R1-4.4.3 Vsoft fail = V at I = 1.5A  This criterionis widely used in Japan.3 Other values of current orcurrent density may be used as soft failure criteria byagreement of the parties to the test.

SEMI MF1809-0704 © SEMI 2003, 20041 SEMI MF1809-0704GUIDE FOR SELECTION AND USE OF ETCHING SOLUTIONS TODELINEATE STRUCTURAL DEFECTS IN SILICONThis guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication by the NorthAmerican Regional Standards Committee on April 22, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org May 2004;to be published July 2004. Original edition published by ASTM International as ASTM F 1809-97. Lastprevious edition SEMI MF1809-02.1 Purpose1.1 Structural defects formed in the bulk of a siliconwafer during its growth or induced by electronic deviceprocessing can affect the performance of the circuitryfabricated on that wafer. These defects take the form ofdislocations, slip, stacking faults, shallow pits, orprecipitates.1.2 The exposure of the various defects found on or ina silicon wafer is often the first critical step inevaluating wafer quality or initiating failure analysis ofan errant device structure. Etching often accomplishesthis task. This guide provides information on theselection and application of appropriate etchingsolutions. 2 Scope2.1 This guide covers the formulation, selection, anduse of chemical solutions developed to reveal structuraldefects in silicon wafers.2.2 Sample preparation, temperature control, etchingtechnique, and choice of etchant are all key factors inthe successful use of an etching method. This guideprovides information for several etching solutions andprovides guidance for the user to select according to theneed. Illustrations of results obtained with theseetching solutions are provided in Figures 132.2.3 This guide is intended for use with other practicesand test methods. SEMI MF1725 and SEMI MF1726are practices for analysis of crystallographic perfectionof silicon ingots and wafers, respectively, utilizingetching solutions found in this guide, and followed bycounting in accordance with the test method SEMIMF1810. SEMI MF1727 defines the procedures foroxidation of the wafer prior to etching, if that isrequired to expose the defect structures of interest. JISH 0609 is a test method that covers the entire process ofdetermining crystalline defects in silicon wafers.2.4 Both this guide and JIS H 0609 emphasize the useof etching solutions that do not contain chromic acid,which is biologically and ecologically very hazardous(see Section 7.6). Because of the hazardous nature ofchrome containing etchants, the use of chromic acid containing etchants is prohibited in some jurisdictionslocated in various parts of the world.NOTE 1: See Related Information 1 for a discussion of therelationships between this guide and JIS H-0609.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Complicating factors are different for each etchant.Research the choice of etchants in advance to ensurethe method and solution are compatible with the sampleand objectives. Commonly encountered problems are:3.1.1 Inadvertent etching through the denuded zone ofan oxidized sample delineates irrelevant bulk defectsinstead of the surface oxidation induced stacking faults(OISF) expected.3.1.2 Accelerated etching and etching artifacts canresult from excessive solution heating during theetching process.3.1.3 Insufficient agitation, bubble formation orparticles in the etching solution can generate artifactson the silicon surface that mimic actual defects.Insufficient agitation can alter the etching rate,increasing or decreasing it depending upon theformulation.3.1.4 Any solution in which the oxidation rate isgreater than the oxide dissolution rate may form oxidelayers that slow or even quench the etching process.The presence of these oxide layers (especially for n+and p+ material) obstructs the interpretation of etcheddefects. Before evaluation, remove any surface oxides.3.1.5 The wafer surface becomes rougher with longeretch time. This rougher surface does not prevent evalu-ation under the microscope, but it greatly reduces theeffectiveness of visual inspection under bright light.3.1.6 Etching solutions can generate false pits that arenot associated with defects.

Systems range from a simple HF-resistant beaker to large etching tanks complete withnitrogen bubblers, temperature control and nitrousoxide and hydrofluoric acid (HF) scrubbers.6.1.1 For larger samples (wafers or slugs), use largeetching tanks with nitrogen bubble agitation orultrasonic agitation. Most of the etchant solutions listedwork more effectively with the aid of agitation. Heatexchangers or just the thermal mass of the solution cancontrol temperature.

Handle and use them in a chemicalexhaust fume hood, with the utmost care. Hydrofluoricacid solutions are particularly hazardous.7.6 Release of chromic acid or solutions of chromicacid into domestic sewer systems is usually notallowed. Chromates are extreme biological andecological hazards. Chromic acid is a strong oxidizingagent and should not contact organic solvents or othereasily oxidized materials.7.7 Safety or protective gear should be worn whilehandling these acid solutions or their components.Safety requirements vary, but essential items are plasticgloves, safety glasses, face shield, acid gown, and shoecovers. The handling of large quantities of powderedchromic acid may require a respirator or other breathingapparatus. 8 Procedure8.1 Selection of Etching Solutions8.1.1 The following tables show two broad categoriesof solutions. The first group in Tables 1 and 3 includesonly chromium-free etching solutions. Although usesmay be limited, these solutions should be consideredwhenever appropriate. The second group in Tables 2and 4 includes only solutions that contain chromiumcompounds. These do well for their intendedapplications, but they can be harmful to theenvironment. Use these highly contaminated etchingsolutions with caution. Release into the environment ofhexavalent chromium waste is a recognized hazard (seeSection 7.6). Exposure can cause cancer.NOTE 2: Copper-3 solution is also identified as MEMCetch in referenced publications.NOTE 3: Sopori and Sato etches have been suggested forinclusion in Tables 2 and 4, and these solutions may be addedwhen solution information and pictures become availablefrom sponsors (see Related Information 2 for themethodology by which new solutions can be added to theguide). 8.1.2 Tables 1 and 2 list the figure numbers of theetched defect examples for these etching solutionstogether with their etching rates.8.1.3 Tables 3 and 4 classify the suitability of eachlisted etching solution for the various applications. Inthe tables, A = Excellent, B = Good, C = Acceptable, and D = Unacceptable.Each solution has advantages and disadvantages andthis guide does not endorse one in favor of another.Selection of an etchant solution should be based uponetch rate, etchant life, solution heating, environmentalharm, ease of interpretation, and range of use.8.1.4 Investigate local environmental and safetyrequirements before selecting an etchant solution.Identify the sample orientation, type, resistivity level,and primary defects of interest; this information helpsthe user rank the various possible solutions and thenselect the most appropriate choice.8.1.4.1 Although this guide does not require a specificsolution, it is highly recommended that chromium-freeetching solutions should be used whenever possible, forenvironmental and biological reasons.8.2 Sample Preparation8.2.1 Most silicon samples have residual oxide on thesurface, either thermally grown as part of thefabrication process or occurring naturally due toexposure to air.8.2.2 Immediately before defect etching, submerge thesample in concentrated HF solution for 1 min or untilthe surface becomes hydrophobic to remove surfaceoxide layers.8.2.3 Rinse and hold the samples in deionized wateruntil transferred to the etching solution.8.3 Defect Etching8.3.1 No standard design for etching systems exists(see Section 6.1). In general, the procedures defined forthe etching system available to the user of this guidemust be followed. A simple system for manual use isas follows:8.3.1.1 Place the specimen in the bottom of a HF-proofbeaker with the surface to be inspected facing upward.8.3.1.2 Pour in sufficient etchant to cover the specimenwith about 2 cm of solution.

R1-1 Both this guide and test method JIS H-0609identify etching solutions for use in delineatingstructural defects in silicon. As indicated in 2.3, thisguide is intended to be used with other practices andtest methods while JIS H-0609 covers the entiredelineation and counting process. R1-2 JIS H-0609 contains sections on terminology,sample preparation, including thermal oxidation, selec-tion of etchants, etching procedures, measurement loca-tions, and measurement methods for various crystallinedefects.R1-2.1 The definitions of the various crystal defectsare generally similar to those in SEMI MF1241 withonly minor differences in emphasis.R1-2.2 Sample preparation and etching procedures aresimilar in most respects to the procedures in SEMIMF1725, SEMI MF1726, and (for thermal oxidation)SEMI MF1727. The minor differences in definitionsare not considered to be technically significant.R1-2.3 JIS H-0609 covers only non-chromic etchingsolutions that differ from those covered in this guide. Tables R1-1 and R1-2 list the etching solutionsdiscussed in JIS H-0609. Detailed discussions of thesuitability of the various etching solutions andmicrophotographs of exposed crystal defects areprovided in JIS H-0609, similarly to the manner inwhich similar information is provided in this guide.Although JIS H-0609 does not cover the use of chrome-containing etching solutions, it does contain com-parisons with the etch rates of several chrome-con-taining etching solutions, including Secco, Wright, andSirtl etches (see Section 9 for references to theseetching solutions).R1-2.4 JIS H-0609 covers a variety of different mea-suring locations and counting procedures for variousdifferent crystal defects, unlike SEMI MF1810, whichdescribes only a method for counting etch pits in aspecified pattern. Visual inspection of some defecttypes is recommended by JIS H-0609; such visualinspection is also covered in SEMI MF523. JIS H-0609includes a discussion of observation of denuded zone,but because of the variety of technologies in place forthis aspect, no standardized measurement method isdefined.

SEMI MF1810-0304 © SEMI 2003, 20041 SEMI MF1810-0304TEST METHOD FOR COUNTING PREFERENTIALLY ETCHED ORDECORATED SURFACE DEFECTS IN SILICON WAFERS This test method was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication bythe North American Regional Standards Committee on December 4, 2003. Initially available atwww.semi.org February 2004; to be published March 2004. Originally published by ASTM International asASTM F 1810-97. Last previous edition SEMI MF1810-97 (Reapproved 2002).1 Purpose1.1 Defects on or in silicon wafers may adverselyaffect device performance and yield.1.2 Crystal defect analysis is a useful technique introubleshooting device process problems. The type,location, and density of defects counted by this testmethod may be related to the crystal growth process,surface preparation, contamination, or thermal historyof the wafer.1.3 This test method is suitable for acceptance testingwhen used with referenced standards. 2 Scope2.1 This test method describes the technique to countthe density of surface defects in silicon wafers bymicroscopic analysis.NOTE 1: Practical use of a defect counting method requiresan assumption be made that defects are randomly distributedon the surface. If this assumption is not met, the accuracy andprecision of this test method will be diminished. 2.2 Application of this test method is limited tospecimens that have discrete, identifiable artifacts onthe surface of the silicon sample. Typical samples havebeen preferentially etched according to SEMI MF1809or epitaxially deposited, forming defects in a siliconlayer structure.2.3 Wafer thickness and diameter for this test methodis limited only by the range of microscope stagemotions available.2.4 This test method is applicable to silicon waferswith defect density between 0.01 and 10,000 defects percm2.NOTE 2: The commercially significant defect density rangeis between 0.01 to 10 defects per cm2, but this test methodextends to higher defect levels due to the improved statisticalsampling obtained with higher counts.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Improper identification of defects is possibleduring the counting process.3.1.1 Contamination not removed by cleaningprocedures or deposited following cleaning, maybecome visible after preferential etching.3.1.2 Insufficient agitation during the preferentialetching process may cause artifacts that may bemistaken as crystallographic defects.3.2 The accuracy of the defect density calculation isdirectly affected by calibration of the area of themicroscope field of view.3.3 The defect density determined by this test methodrequires an assumption be made that defects arerandomly distributed on the surface. Nonuniformpatterns of defects alter the defect density measurementby their size and location.3.4 Multiple scan patterns intersect at the center of thewafer. If a defect is found at this single, common point,it is counted more than once and thus alters theaccuracy of the count. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specifications for Polished Monocrystal-line Silicon WafersSEMI MF1241  Terminology of Silicon TechnologySEMI MF1725  Practice for Analysis of Crystal-lographic Perfection of Silicon IngotsSEMI MF1726  Practice for Analysis of Crystal-lographic Perfection of Silicon WafersSEMI MF1727  Practice for Detection of OxidationInduced Defects in Polished Silicon WafersSEMI MF1809  Guide for Selection and Use ofEtching Solutions to Delineate Structural Defects inSilicon

As indicated in these practices, thedefect to be analyzed is exposed using one of thespecific etching solutions listed in SEMI MF1809.6.2 The wafer is aligned on a microscope stage.6.3 It is then inspected according to predefinedinspection pattern.6.3.1 The basic inspection pattern is a single scan alonga wafer diameter. The starting and ending points of thescan pattern are 5 mm from the edges of the wafer.Figure 1 represents the characteristics of the basicpattern.6.3.2 The complete inspection pattern of this testmethod is based upon the combination of four separatebasic scans across different diameters.6.4 Finally, specific defects distinguished by shape orsize are counted. 7 Apparatus7.1 Nonmetallic Vacuum Pickup Tool  Of suitablematerial such as quartz or TFE-fluorocarbon. Thepickup tool shall be constructed so that no metal cancontact the specimen wafer.7.2 Optical Microscope  Equipped with interferencecontrast attachment.NOTE 3: Nomarski differential interference contrast is anexample of interference contrast.7.2.1 Eyepiece and Objective Lens  In combinationshall give a magnification range of approximately 100to 400 magnification of the specimen. The dimensionof the field of view at each magnification option iscalibrated to allow defect density calculations. NOTE: Begin scan 5 mm from the edge.Figure 1The Basic Microscopic Inspection Scan Pattern 7.2.2 Graduated Metric X-Y Microscope Stage  Usedfor sample positioning. 8 Sampling8.1 Specimens shall be selected to represent the lot tobe tested as specified in producer-consumeragreements. 9 Procedure9.1 Four Scan Inspection Pattern9.1.1 Place the specimen wafer onto the microscopeinspection stage. Handle wafers only with a cleannonmetallic vacuum pickup tool to avoid scratching orcontaminating the surface.9.1.2 Place the specimen such that a single linearmotion of the stage (either x or y) allows counting ofdefects contained in the field of view along the pathlabeled AB in Figure 1. Points A and B are 5 mm fromthe wafer edge and the line AB is rotated 45° from thelocation of the major orientation flat or notch.Alternative edge exclusion positions are acceptablewith the agreement of the parties involved.9.1.3 Scan the path and record the classification andnumbers of the defects observed during the scan. Referto descriptions and pictures in SEMI MF1809.9.1.4 Rotate the wafer by 45° clockwise on themicroscope stage and repeat Section 9.1.3 for thesecond scan. Refer to Figure 2 for improved definitionof the scan pattern.9.1.5 Rotate the wafer by 45° clockwise on themicroscope stage and repeat Section 9.1.3 for the thirdscan.9.1.6 Rotate the wafer by 45° clockwise on themicroscope stage and repeat Section 9.1.3 for the fourthscan.

Calculate the total area inspected bymultiplying four (4) times the calibrated width of thefield of view in centimeters by the length of the scan incentimeters. The length (L) in centimeters is the waferdiameter (D) in centimeters minus twice the 0.5 cmedge exclusion (E):0.12 == DEDL (1)The density is the defect count divided by the total area.NOTE 4: When a scan intersects a flat, notch or laser mark,the total area must be adjusted according to the reduced lengthof the affected scans. Failure to adjust the area results ininaccuracy. 10 Report10.1 Report the following information:10.1.1 Date of test, laboratory and operator,10.1.2 Identification of the specimen wafer,conductivity type, orientation, and diameter,10.1.3 Specimen history; thermal cycle, preferentialetchant formulation, thickness removal duringpreferential etching,10.1.4 Inspection conditions; magnification, and totalarea inspected, and10.1.5 Defect density and precision by defectclassification. 11 Precision and Bias11.1 Precision  The multi laboratory precision ofthis test method was established through a round-robinexperiment. Seven (7) wafers with randomlydistributed oxidation induced stacking faults (OISFs)were analyzed by sixteen (16) laboratories over eleven(11) diameter scans. Repeatability and reproducibilityof this test method were calculated using two sets of four scan measurements from each laboratory andwafer. The wafer samples were prepared according toSEMI MF1727 and etched with Wright Etch inaccordance with SEMI MF1809.11.1.1 Repeatability  The method repeatability isequal to 2.8 times the within-laboratory standarddeviation or 5.22 defects/cm2 . Repeatability contributes23.81% of the total variation. The variability of themeasurement is sample dependent; assumptions ofrandom OISF location were described as a limitation(see Section 3.3).11.1.2 Reproducibility  The method reproducibilityis equal to 2.8 times the between-laboratory standarddeviation or 9.31 defects/cm2. Reproducibilitycontributes 75.73% of the total variation.NOTE 5: Additional analysis is presented in RelatedInformation 1. A study of two repetitions of this test methodwas extracted from the existing, multiple scan data measuredat each laboratory. 11.1.3 The wafers exhibited single diameter scans thatranged from 0 to 13 defects/cm2 while the grandaverage of all measurements for each wafer yieldeddensities of 0.21 to 3.60 defects/cm2. The range inmeasurement density is related to differences betweenlaboratories and local variation of the defect density onthe wafer itself.11.1.4 Ten separate diameters were measured on eachof 7 wafers by 16 laboratories. The total number ofscans for each sample was 160. Table 1 shows thesample dependence of the results with the standarddeviation versus mean OISF count for ten independentscans.Table 1 Ten Scan Inspection Data Wafer Identity StandardDeviationMean OISFDensity All Data(OISF/cm 2)A 0.49 0.21B 1.79 1.43C 1.93 1.98D 1.02 0.82E 2.51 3.60F 0.63 0.42G 0.71 0.51ALL 1.49 1.28 11.2 Bias  No standard reference materials areavailable to calibrate this measurement; therefore atarget density for each wafer was assigned by averagingthe combined data from all scans of each wafer.Analysis of the round robin is based upon the individualdeviation from the target for each measurement and
