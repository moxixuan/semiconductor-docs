A sample data format for the test chip can be\nfound in Appendix A. Based on the results of computer\nsimulations   of   various   chip-substrate   configurations\n(Section 3.1), the following recommendations are made\nfor  the  design  of  thermal  test  chips  for  VLSI  package\ncharacterization (Section 3.2).\n2  General Guideline\n2. 1  Heat Sources \u2014 The heat sour ces (i.e., transistors\nor  resistor  stripes),  should  use  as  much  of  the  active\nchip  area  as  possible  so  that  the  measured  package\nthermal  resistance  is  indicative  of  the  chip  size  being\nused.  A  10  mil  (0.25  mm)  parameter  stripe  (inactive\narea)  should  be  sufficient  for  bonding  pads  and  scribe\nlanes. It is desirable to use a range of test chip sizes so\nthat  the  package  thermal  resistance  can  be  determined\nas  a  function  of  chip  size.  A  basic  cell  size  of  75  mil\n(1.91 mm) square with a power dissipation capability of\n7. 5  to  10  W  is  recommended.  The  heat  source  area\nshould  exceed  85%  of  this  basic  cell  active  chip  area.\nThis  basic  cell  could  be  arrayed  or  scaled  up  to  a  450\nmil  (11.43  mm)  square  chip  in  increments  of  75  mil\n(1.91 mm) on a side. For larger chip sizes, the basic cell\nsize should be chosen so arrays can match the chip sizes\nin actual use. Since the larger chips can be 15\u201420 mm\nper  side,  the  basic  cell  may  need  to  be  5  mm  per  side,\nso a 3 \xd7 3 array can be 15 mm square minimum.\n2. 2   Spacing  between  Heat  Sources  \u2014  The  spacing\nbetween heat sources, which is needed to accommodate\nthe  temperature-sensing  elements  (i.e.,  p-n  junctions),\nshould  be  minimized.  The  spacing  should  be  less  than\nor  equal  to  2  mil  (0.051  mm).  The  sensing  element\nshould  be  located  at  the  center  of  the  chip  surface.  For\nchips  that  are  built  up  from  an  array  of  standard  cells,\nsensing  elements  are  also  needed  near  a  corner  and\nbetween   two   adjacent   corners   (i.e.,   near   or   in   the\ninactive  regions),  of  the  basic  cell.  Additional  sensing\nelements for such purposes as die attachment evaluation\nand  non-uniform  power  dissipation  studies  may  be\nincluded   as   appropriate.   All   sensing   elements   and\nassociated   metallization   runs   must   be   electrically\nisolated from the heat sources.\n2. 3   Thermal  Test  Chip  Thickness  \u2014   T he  thermal  test\nchip thickness should be between 18 mil (0.46 mm) and\n22  mil  (0.56  mm).  For  thin  packages,  the  test  chip\nthickness should be reduced to the normal die thickness\nfor that package.\n2. 4  Thermal Test Chip \u2014 The ther mal test chip should\nbe  designed  such  that  its  power  dissipation  limitations\nare   consistent   with   the   range   of   package   thermal\nresistance encountered. This includes properly designed\nmetallization   runs   such   that   for   arrayed   test   chips,\nheating  current  for  inner  chips  is  routed  so  that  wire\nruns  from  the  package  to  inner  chips  are  minimized.\nThe  ability  to  cause  a  chip  surface-to-case  temperature\ndifference  of  at  least  20\xb0C  is  desirable.  To  accomplish\nthis for silicon chips mounted on a variety of substrates\n(ranging   from   alumina   to   beryllia),   the   basic   cell\nstructure  (i.e.,  75  mil  (1.91  mm)  on  a  side)  should\ndissipate a minimum of 7.5 W.\n2. 5  Bond Pads \u2014 Band pads (clea r opening) should be\nequal  to  or  greater  than  4  mil  (0.10  mm)  on  a  side.\nSensing  and  heating  elements  should  not  be  connected\nto  common  bonding  pads.  Bonding  pad  location  and\nsize  can  or  should  be  configured  such  that  for  arrayed\ntest   chips,   chip-to-chip   bonding   is   facilitated   (i.e.,\nbonding  wire  runs  from  the  package  to  inner  chips  are\nminimized),  but  this  is  not  mandatory  for  acceptable\nfunctional operation.\n2. 6       Temperature-Sensing      Diode/D iode      Bridge\nElements   \u2014   The   temperature-sensing   diode/diode\nbridge  elements  should  be  usable  over  the  complete\noperating  power  and  temperature  range  of  the  thermal\ntest  chip.  The  thermal  test  chip  should  function  at\njunction temperature of 130\xb0C minimum.\n2. 7   Arrayed  and  Scaled  Up  Therm al  Test  Chips \u2014\nPictorial   representation   of   arrayed   and   scaled   up\nthermal  test  chips  are  depicted  in  Figures  1  and  2,\nrespectively.   Heating   elements   (shaded   areas)   are\ntransistors  or  resistor  stripes  connected  in  a  variety  of\nseries-parallel  combinations  on  as  well  as  off  the  chip.\nThe heating elements should fill as much of the shaded\narea  as  practical  (consistent  with  the  integrated  circuit\nlayout design rules).\n3  References\n3. 1      Albers,     J.,     \u201cSemiconductor     Me asurement\nTechnology:  TXYZ:  A  Program  for  Semiconductor  IC\nThermal  Analysis,\u201d  NIST  Spec.
