SEMI MF525-0705 © SEMI 2003, 2005 16 R2-3 Propagation of Random Error and Uncertainty of Resistivity Values When Determining Test SpecimenResistivity by Calibrated Spreading Resistance MeasurementsR2-3.1 If the entire calibration procedure (or just a part containing specimens of a limited range of resistivity valuesof interest) is performed once for each test specimen measured, the random errors for the measurement of both testand calibration specimens are statistically independent and can be added in root-mean-square fashion to estimate thetotal random error uncertainty, s T, in the derived resistivity value of a test specimen:22ctTs += (R2-3) R2-3.1.1 The associated 95% confidence interval for resistivity values derived from spreading resistancemeasurements, considering only random sources of error, is given by S T = 1.96 s T, or approximately by 2s T.R2-3.2 If the calibration procedure is performed once, and a number of test specimens are then measured beforecalibration is performed again, the random errors are not independent and the errors cannot be combined in theabove fashion. In this case, the random errors on the calibration specimen act as short-term systematic errors: theerrors for some calibration specimens are on the high side, the errors for others are on the low side, and they will befixed until the next calibration. If this situation obtains, a reasonable estimate of the 95% confidence interval forderived resistivity values, due to what are normally random errors, is given by:( )ctTS + 2 (R2-4) where t and c are obtained from Equations R2-1 and R2-2.R2-4 Examples of Use of Propagation of Error Equations to Estimate the 95% Confidence Limits (Due to RandomError Only) for the Resistivity Values of a Test SpecimenR2-4.1 Assumptions  One preparation each of test specimens and of calibration specimens (np = mp = 1); tenmeasurements are taken and averaged on the calibration specimens closest in resistivity to the test specimen (mr =10; five measurements are taken and averaged on the test specimen (n r = 5); the test specimen has a resistivity ofapproximately 1 Ωcm: s = 0.7%; diamond bevel polishing is used (r = 6.3%,R = 6.2%).R2-4.2 Case I  Calibration measurements are always taken prior to measurement of each test specimen. %88.60688.051062.01063.0 22==+=t %64.60664.0007.0101062.01063.0 222==++=c %1.19191.00664.00688.02 22 ==+TS R2-4.3 Case II  Calibration measurements are not taken prior to each test specimen measurement.( ) %0.27270.00664.00688.02 ==+TS R2-5 Equations R2-1 through R2-4 may also be used to estimate the random error in the measurement processbased only on measurements in a single laboratory.

SEMI MF525-0705 © SEMI 2003, 200517 RELATED INFORMATION 3SOURCES OF SYSTEMATIC ERROR NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI MF525. It was derived from informationdeveloped during the original preparation of the standard in ASTM Committee F-1 on Electronics in 1977. Thisrelated information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures. R3-1 In addition to random errors, there are a number of sources of systematic error which can be identified butwhich cannot be estimated here; their estimation must be done by the individual laboratory.R3-2 Calibration Specimen Nonuniformity  The four-point probe method for measuring the resistivity of thecalibration specimens responds to the average resistivity of a specimen over an area which is several times the totalspacing of the four-point probe. Within this area there may be significant variation of resistivity. Spreadingresistance measurements respond to the local resistivity of the calibration specimens. Calibration specimens shalltherefore have uniform resistivity such that the resistivity assigned to the specimen by use of the four-point probemethod satisfactorily represents the resistivity value at the location where spreading resistance calibrationmeasurements will be taken; otherwise systematic errors are incurred in calibration.R3-3 Choosing a Model for the Calibration Relation  The empirical relation between spreading resistance andresistivity values of the calibration specimens are commonly approximated by a number of different relations:single-piece log-log least-squares fit, piecewise log-log fit, and polynomial fit. The best form or model to fit thecalibration data has not been established. Any of the chosen models may have significant high-side or low-sidesystematic errors at various resistivity values compared to the unknown true relation.R3-4 Loss of Control of the Spreading-Resistance Probes  Wear, contamination, or other degradation of theprobes may cause sudden shifts in measurement response at some or all resistivity values. Such shifts may not beaccompanied by recognizable loss of measurement precision and merely add an additional systematic error betweencalibration and test specimen measurement values.R3-5 Loss of Control of Specimen Preparation Process  Contamination of specimen-polishing materials or post-polishing chemicals as well as excess polishing-induced damage or unrecognized differences in technique such asapplied pressure, specimen area, or post-polishing storage environment may cause undetected systematic errors intest or calibration specimen values.

SEMI MF657-0705 © SEMI 2003, 20051 SEMI MF657-0705TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING WARP AND TOTAL THICKNESSVARIATION ON SILICON WAFERS BY NONCONTACT SCANNING This test method was technically approved by the global Silicon Wafer Committee. This edition wasapproved for publication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on April 6, 2005. It was availableat www.semi.org in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005. Original edition published by ASTMInternational as ASTM F 657-80. Last previous edition SEMI MF657-92 (Reapproved 1999). 1 Purpose1.1 Warp and thickness variation of silicon wafers can significantly affect the yield of semiconductor deviceprocessing.1.2 Knowledge of these characteristics can help the supplier and customer determine if the dimensionalcharacteristics of a particular wafer satisfy given geometrical requirements.1.3 Changes in wafer warp during processing can adversely affect subsequent handling and processing steps1.4 This test method is suitable for measuring the warp and TTV of silicon wafers used in semiconductor deviceprocessing in the as-sliced, lapped, or polished condition and for monitoring thermal and mechanical effects on thewarp of silicon wafers during device processing. 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers a noncontacting, nondestructive procedure to determine the warp and total thicknessvariation (TTV) of clean, dry silicon wafers in a free (unclamped) condition. The procedure uses a three-point backsurface reference plane for determining warp.2.2 The test method is applicable to circular silicon wafers from 50 mm (or 2.0 in.) to 200 mm in diameter, and100 m (or 0.004 in. approximately) and larger in thickness, independent of thickness variation and surface finish.The test method is applicable to wafers of semiconductors other than silicon with these same physicalcharacteristics.2.3 This test method is not intended to measure surface flatness; warp, which is not to be confused with flatness, isa bulk property of the wafer. Warp may be caused by unequal stresses on the two exposed surfaces of the wafer. Itcannot be determined from measurements on a single exposed surface. The median surface may contain regionswith upward or downward curvature or both; under some conditions the median surface may be flat.2.4 This test method measures warp and TTV of a wafer with no mechanical force except gravity applied during thetest. Therefore, the procedure described gives the unconstrained value of warp or TTV. Gravity-induced deflectionalters the shape of the wafer and is included in the measurement.2.5 For application to wafers of diameter 3 in. or smaller, the values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded asthe standard whether or not they appear in parentheses; the values stated in acceptable metric units are forinformation only. For application to wafers of diameter larger than 3 in., the values stated in acceptable metric unitsare to be regarded as the standard; the values stated in inch-pound units are for information only.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 In this test method, both TTV and warp are determined using a specified partial scan pattern; thus, the entiresurface is not sampled and use of another scan pattern may not yield the same result.3.2 Most equipment systems capable of this measurement have a definite range of wafer thickness combined withwarp which can be accommodated without readjustment. Any values observed while in an over-range condition areinvalid.

&lt;!-- Page 6 --&gt;

SEMI MF657-0705 © SEMI 2003, 2005 2 3.3 This test method does not completely separate thickness variation from warp. In some cases, the mediansurface may be flat but still show a non-zero value for warp.3.4 Running probes off the test specimen during the scan sequence gives false readings.3.5 Any change in the reference plane during scanning produces error in the indicated measurement equal to theaxial vector value of the deviation at the probe axes at the points of largest and smallest differences. If such changesoccur, there is the possibility that an incorrect location may be identified as an extremum.3.6 Non-parallelism of the reference plane to the granite base surface produces an error in the indicatedmeasurement proportional to the non-parallelism.3.7 Foreign particles (dirt) between the measuring ring and surface plate introduce error.3.8 Vibration of the test specimen relative to the probe-measuring axis introduces error. 4 Referenced Standards and Documents4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specifications for Polished Monocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI M59  Terminology for Silicon Technology4.2 ANSI StandardANSI/ASME B46.1  Surface Texture (Surface Roughness, Waviness, and Lay) 1 4.3 Federal StandardGGG-P 463 C Surface Plate, Granite 2 NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 median surface (of a semiconductor wafer)  the locus of points in the wafer equidistant from the front andback surfaces.5.1.2 Other terms relating to silicon technology are defined in SEMI M59. 6 Summary of Test Method6.1 The wafer is supported by three hemispherical points on a reference ring, and both surfaces are simultaneouslyscanned along a prescribed pattern by both members of an opposed pair of probes.6.2 The displacements (distances) between each probe and the nearest surface of the wafer are determined (in pairs)at intervals along the scan pattern.6.3 Half the difference between the largest and smallest of the differences of the paired displacements is taken as ameasure of the warp.6.4 The difference between the largest and smallest of the sums of the paired displacements is taken as a measure ofthe total thickness variation. 7 Apparatus7.1 Warp Measuring Equipment  Consisting of movable reference ring, fixed probe assembly with indicator,guide, and surface plate as follows: 1 American National Standards Institute, New York Office: 25 West 43rd Street, New York, NY 10036, USA.

Each reference ring shall befabricated of a metal whose thermal coefficient of expansion shall not exceed 11  106/°C (or 6  106/°F) atlaboratory temperatures; be at least 19 mm (or 0.75 in.) thick, with the bottom surface lapped flat to within 250 nm(or 10 in.); have an outside diameter approximately 50 mm (or 2 in.) larger than the nominal diameter of thespecimen wafer with which it is intended to be used; and incorporate the following features:7.1.1.1 Three Hemispherical Support Pads  Used to define the plane of the reference ring and equally spacedwithin ±130 m (or ±0.005 in) on the circumference of a circle whose diameter is 6.35 mm (or 0.250 in.) less thanthe nominal diameter of the wafer as given in SEMI M1. The support pads shall be fabricated from tungstencarbide, or from a material of the same or greater hardness, have a nominal diameter of 3.18 mm (or 0.125 in.), andproject 1.59 ± 0.13 mm (or 0.0625 ± 0.0050 in.) above the upper surface of the reference ring. The upper bearingsurface of each support pad shall be polished, with a maximum surface roughness RA of 250 nm (or 10 in.)measured with 0.8 mm (or 0.31-in) cutoff in accordance with ANSI/ASME B 46.1.7.1.1.2 Three Cylindrical Guide Pins  Used to assist the operator to position the specimen wafer by eye, spacedapproximately equally on the circumference of a circle whose diameter is nominally equal to the sum of thediameter of the pin and the maximum allowable wafer diameter as given in SEMI M1. The guide pins shall be atleast 380 m (or 0.015 in.) higher than the support pads (see Figure 1).7.1.1.3 Probe Parking Position  Cut-out area in the reference ring outside the nominal wafer diameter to permitthe ring to be positioned so that the probe assembly is out of the way for specimen or precision flat insertion andremoval (see Figure 1).NOTE 1: The plane defined by the reference ring is the plane tangent to the three pads.NOTE 2: It is recommended that the guide pins be fabricated from a hard plastic material.7.1.2 Probe Assembly with Indicator  Paired, non-contacting, displacement-sensing probes, probe supports, andindicator unit. The probes shall be capable of independent measurement of the distance between the probed site oneach surface of the specimen slice and the plane of the reference ring. The probes shall be mounted above andbelow the specimen position in a manner so that the probe site on one surface of the specimen is opposite the probedsite on the other. The common axis of mounting shall be perpendicular (±2°) to the plane defined by the referencering. The upper probe mount shall incorporate a positioning adjustment to accommodate the wafer thickness rangedesired. The indicator unit shall be capable of displaying the output from each probe individually and of beingmanually reset. The assembly shall satisfy the following requirements:7.1.2.1 Probe-sensing area (probed site) diameter shall be in the range from 1.55 to 5.75 mm (or 0.062 to 0.225 in),7.1.2.2 Displacement resolution of 250 nm (or 10 in) or better from a probed site,7.1.2.3 Displacement range (for each probe) of at least ±0.010 in.

TIR, maximum. The thickness of the flat shall be such as to permit the flat to be placed andmeasured in the specimen position (see 9.2). 8 Sampling8.1 This test method is nondestructive and may be used on either a 100% or a sampling basis.8.2 If samples are to be taken, procedures for selecting the sample from each lot of wafers to be tested shall beagreed upon by the parties to the text, as shall the definition of what constitutes a lot. 9 Calibration and Standardization9.1 Through measurements on set-up thickness masters sized according to the nominal diameter of the intendedspecimen wafer (see 7.3), calibrate and qualify the apparatus as follows:9.1.1 If not already assembled, assemble the apparatus with the selected reference ring, corresponding to theintended specimen size, on the surface plate and the guide in position to limit ring movement. Make sure that theprobes are in the parking position and that the position is away from the operator (see Figure 2).9.1.2 Make, record, and analyze measurements on each selected setup thickness master in turn, in accordance withthe manufacturer's instructions or in accordance with the sections on procedure and calculations (10 and Figure 4).Position the ring so that the probes are in the parking position before inserting or removing a master.9.1.3 Construct a plot of measured thickness of each master as a function of known thickness. Draw a straight linethrough the end points. At each end point, plot two additional points representing values of +0.5% and 0.5% of theend point values. Draw a limit line through the two +0.5% values. Draw another limit line through the two 0.5%

Remove the flat.9.2.3 Inspect the recorded distance values andcalculate the difference between the maximum andminimum value.9.2.4 If the difference calculated in 9.2.3 is less thanor equal to 1.5 m (or 60 in.), accept the apparatus as satisfying the parallelism requirement.NOTE 7: The value 1.5 m (or 60 in.) represents the total system transfer error of the reference ring together with the surfaceplate and is intentionally greater than the tolerance of 1.0 m (or 40 in.) given for the parallelism of the defined plane of thereference ring and the bottom surface of the ring. 10 Procedure10.1 If not already assembled, assemble the apparatus with the selected reference ring corresponding to the intendedspecimen size on the surface plate and the matching guide in position to limit ring movement. Make sure that theprobes are in the parking position and that the position is away from the operator (see Figure 2).10.2 Place the test specimen on the support pads with the primary flat parallel with the flat orientation line and withthe periphery of the test specimen against the two guide pins closest to the probe parking position.10.3 Move the ring on the surface plate until the probes are at the starting position of the scan.10.4 Reset the indicator.10.5 Move the reference ring on the surface plate to scan the probes along the curved and straight segments 1through 7 (see Figure 4).10.6 Record, in inches or micrometres, the individual displacements of the top and bottom surfaces at selectedpoints along the scan pattern or, for direct-reading instruments, the difference between the largest and smallest of thedifferences or sums of the paired displacements, depending on whether warp (differences) or TTV (sums) is beingmeasured.10.7 For referee measurements only, repeat 10.4 through 10.7 nine more times.10.8 Position the ring so that the probes are in the parking position and remove the specimen.10.9 Repeat 10.2 through 10.8 for each wafer to be measured. 11 Calculations11.1 Unless the instrument is direct reading, calculate for each wafer the difference between each pair ofdisplacement values a and b and inspect the differences to identify the maximum and minimum difference values.Calculate the warp or TTV in micrometers or inches according to the appropriate relation: \[ \]minmax )()(21warp abab = (1) = Thickness of Master Figure 3Thickness Gauge Linearity Check

Thewafers in each set of five had warp values from about 6 to about 40 m, and TTV values from about 1 to about 5m.13.2 Three laboratories used warp measuring equipment that did not conform to the requirements of this testmethod, and one additional laboratory did not supply warp data. Two laboratories used TTV measuring equipmentthat did not conform to the requirements of this test method. Data from these laboratories were excluded from theanalysis.13.3 Based on warp results from seven laboratories and TTV results from nine laboratories, the repeatability (withinlaboratory) is estimated to be 1.45 ± 0.42 m and 0.92 ± 0.20 m for warp and TTV, respectively. No significantdifference was noted between measurements on 100 and on 125 mm diameter wafers. There was no significanttrend in repeatability with measured value (see Figure 5).13.4 The reproducibility (between laboratories) is estimated to be 5.25 ± 3.19 m and 3.25 ± 0.92 m for warp andTTV, respectively. In this case, there was some increase in the value of warp reproducibility as the warp valueincreased and a less pronounced increase in the value of TTV reproducibility as the TTV value increased (see Figure6).NOTE 8: In these figures, the numbers are identification numbers. The initial digit represents the approximate nominal diameterof the sample wafers in inches13.5 No statement of bias can be made because there are no reference standards against which the result of thismeasurement can be compared.

SEMI MF671-0705 © SEMI 2003, 20051 SEMI MF671-0705TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING FLAT LENGTH ON WAFERS OFSILICON AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MATERIALS This test method was technically approved by the global Silicon Wafer Committee. This edition wasapproved for publication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on April 7, 2005. It was availableat www.semi.org in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005. Original edition published by ASTMInternational as ASTM F 671-80. Last previous edition SEMI MF671-99. 1 Purpose1.1 The length of fiducial flats is an important materials characteristic for determining the suitability of material foruse in semiconductor processing.1.2 Automatic wafer handling equipment widely used in semiconductor device manufacturing processes relies onidentification and orientation of the primary flat to obtain correct alignment.1.3 This test method is suitable for use in research, development, process control, quality assurance, and materialsacceptance applications. 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers techniques for determination of the length of the flatted portion of a wafer periphery.2.2 This test method is intended primarily for use on electronic materials in the form of nominally circular edge-contoured wafers with flat lengths up to 65 mm. The precision of this test method has been established directly onlyfor silicon wafers, but it is not expected to be material dependent.2.3 This test method is suitable for referee measurement purposes and may be used for routine acceptancemeasurements when specified limits require test precision greater than can be obtained with hand held scale andunaided eye.2.4 This test method is independent of surface finish.2.5 For application to wafers of diameter 3 in. or smaller, the values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded asthe standard whether or not they appear in parentheses; the values stated in acceptable metric units are forinformation only. For application to wafers of diameter larger than 3 in., the values stated in acceptable metric unitsare to be regarded as the standard; the values stated in inch-pound units are for information only.NOTE 1: DIN 50441, Part 4, is a similar, but not equivalent method for determining flat length. In this method the flat length iscalculated from a measurement of flat depth. This method does not provide any correction for rounding at the ends of the flat.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Some operations performed after slicing, such as mechanical edge grinding and chemical etching, may reduceprofile definition at the ends of the flatted area.3.2 Backlash in the micrometer head assemblies may result in erroneous readings.3.3 Failure to maintain sharp focus on the sample comparator screen image during measurement can introduceerrors.3.4 Comparator optics may sometimes incorporate image-reversal elements, which result in image conditionsopposite to those described by this test method.

SEMI MF674-0705 © SEMI 2003, 20051 SEMI MF674-0705PRACTICES FOR PREPARING SILICON FOR SPREADINGRESISTANCE MEASUREMENTS These practices were technically approved by the global Silicon Wafer Committee. This edition was approved forpublication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on April 7, 2005. It was available at www.semi.org inJune 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005. Original edition published by ASTM International as ASTM F 674-80. Lastprevious edition SEMI MF674-92 (Reapproved 1999).1 Purpose1.1 Resistivity is probably the single most important parameter for the characterization of silicon starting materialfor semiconductor device fabrication. Spreading resistance measurements are used to measure resistivity variationsin raw silicon crystals and completed semiconductor devices. The reproducibility of spreading resistancemeasurements on silicon specimens is known to depend on the manner of specimen preparation. The interpretationof spreading resistance measurements depends in turn on the reproducibility of test specimen measurements and onthe reproducibility of calibration specimen measurements.1.2 The procedures given are intended to confer a high degree of reproducibility to spreading resistancemeasurements, and offer improvement over other preparation techniques.1 2 Scope2.1 These practices cover the surface preparation of silicon samples using diamond polishing prior to measurementof resistivity variations by the spreading resistance technique.NOTE 1: Benefits derived from diamond polishing are (1) stability and reproducibility of spreading resistance values on largearea or beveled specimens, and (2) acuity of beveled surface geometry. The benefits of stability and reproducibility are likely toapply to both conductivity types and all resistivity values; however, they have been demonstrated extensively only for (111) n-type above 1 Ωcm. Enhanced bevel acuity is independent of conductivity-type or resistivity value.2.2 Separate practices are given for preparation of large-area specimens for measurement of lateral resistivityvariations and for preparation of bevel-sectioned specimens (usually small chips) for measurement of verticalvariations of resistivity (depth profiling).2.3 The two practices are covered as follows: Front-Surface Diamond Polishing 7 through 9 Diamond Bevel Polishing 10 through 12NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Polishing of silicon with diamond causes light but controllable and uniform scratch damage to the siliconsurface. Nevertheless, such uniform damage is compatible with spreading resistance measurement data having verylow scatter. Contamination of the polishing medium with hard foreign particles can cause random heavy scratchdamage to a specimen. If encountered by the spreading resistance probes, heavily scratch-damaged regions mayyield erratic measurement results.3.2 Contamination of the specimen with water subsequent to polishing may adversely affect the reproducibility ofspreading resistance measurements. 1 Ehrstein, J.

Polishing of siliconwafers or other large-area specimens is done against a nonwoven polishing cloth; bevel polishing of smallspecimens is done against a frosted lapped glass surface. When polishing is complete, residual polishing compoundis removed by an organic solvent. FRONT-SURFACE DIAMOND POLISHING 7 Apparatus7.1 Polishing Machine  Oscillating-tub polisher or other similar small laboratory-scale polishing machine capableof providing randomized motion of the silicon specimen over the polishing pad.7.2 Mounting Block and Fixture  To support and apply vertical load to the silicon specimen during polishing.7.3 Polishing Pad  Nonwoven cloth pad of a texture specified as being compatible with the grain size of diamondused during polishing. The polishing pad should be adhesive-backed for attaching to a support plate.NOTE 2: The preferred material is of a type identified as a chemotextile. 7.4 Support Plate  Of glass or other similar hard material compatible with the chosen polishing machine andcapable of providing a flat support for the polishing pad during polishing.7.5 Microscope  Optical microscope having a total magnification of at least 30 and provision for obliqueillumination of the specimen.7.6 Hot Plate  Capable of heating the sample mounting block and wax to 150°C. 8 Reagents and Materials8.1 Diamond Slurry  Synthetic or natural diamond with grain size in the range 0.5 to 3 m, inclusive, suspendedin a nonaqueous liquid or paste carrier.NOTE 3: The predominant causes of variation in the surface finish of the silicon specimen are expected to result from (1) theuniformity of particle size in the diamond grit, (2) the inclusion of a large fraction of needle-shaped grains (fines) in addition tothe preferred symmetric grains (blocky diamond), and (3) in the case of diamond suspended in paste, the uniformity of thediamond distribution in the paste. For a fixed diamond grain size, whether the diamond is natural, single-crystal synthetic, orpolycrystalline synthetic should make little difference in the resulting surface finish. However, the abrasive breakdownmechanisms differ somewhat for the different types of diamond. Consequently, the size and type of diamond should be chosen togive an acceptable cutting rate for the specimen and machine conditions that are used.NOTE 4: For use with large-area specimens, the appropriate size diamond grain and, in part, the type of diamond to be usedshould be compatible with (1) the starting surface texture of the silicon, which may range from as-sawn to prepolished, and (2)the load that is applied during polishing. 8.2 Solvent  Suitable nonaqueous solvent for removing diamond slurry subsequent to polishing.NOTE 5: The choice of solvent is governed in part by the composition of the carrier liquid or paste. The supplier of the diamondslurry should be consulted regarding the appropriate solvent. Acetone \[(CH3) 2CO\] and methanol (CH3OH) are known to workwell for removing many commercial diamond compounds.

SEMI MF674-0705 © SEMI 2003, 20053 8.3 Wax  Glycol phthalate or other similar wax having a melting temperature of less than 150°C.8.4 Dry Air or Nitrogen  Source of clean, dry air or nitrogen suitable for drying the specimen. 9 Procedure9.1 If not previously done, attach the polishing pad to the rigid plate and place several drops of diamond polishingslurry at random locations on the polishing pad surface. Spread drops of slurry in a reasonably uniform manner overthe pad so that the pad surface becomes damp and so that there are no freestanding layers of slurry. If the diamondis suspended in paste, be sparing in the amount of paste applied to the pad.NOTE 6: Some polishing slurry adheres to the specimen and mounting fixture and is lost every time a specimen is removed andcleaned. Replenish the slurry on the pad regularly with a few drops of fresh slurry. 9.2 With the hot plate, heat the mounting block to the melting temperature of the wax. Mount the silicon specimento the block with the wax. Allow the block to cool to room temperature.9.3 Assemble the mounting block and attach specimen to the sample mounting fixture and place this assembly onthe polishing pad in the polishing machine.9.4 In accordance with the manufacturer's instructions for the polishing machine, polish until the specimen surfaceexhibits a uniform density of random-direction scratches comparable to the pattern shown in Figure 1. For this test,remove the polishing slurry from the specimen surface and examine that surface with the microscope.NOTE 7: The time required to reach a uniform surface finish depends on specimen surface area, size of diamond grains, staticload applied, rate of movement of the specimen surface over the polishing pad, and previous surface finish.NOTE 8: The coarseness of the scratch damage on the specimen surface is related to the size of diamond grit used. a. 0.5 m Diamond b. 3 m DiamondFigure 1Surface Texture of Large-Area Silicon Specimen Polished with Diamond Against Chemotextile Pad 9.5 When an acceptable surface finish has been reached, thoroughly swab or flush the specimen with the solvent toremove all diamond slurry residues.

Distribute the slurry (or paste)with a clean flexible metal or plastic spatula or other lint-free applicator so that a thin, uniform film results over anarea whose dimensions are several times larger than the lateral dimension of the fixture used to support the bevelingblock. An oil extender may be used to prolong the life of the slurry. The oil extender generally slows the cuttingsomewhat and aids lubrication during beveling.12.3 With the hot plate, heat the mounting block to the melting temperature of the wax. Mount the silicon specimento the block with the wax. Allow the block to cool to room temperature.12.4 Assemble the sample mounting block with specimen attached to the mounting fixture, and place this assemblyon the glass plate. Lower the piston of the polishing fixture carefully and gently onto the glass plate to minimize therisk of chipping or otherwise damaging the silicon chip.12.5 Polish the specimen by orbital, figure-eight, or reciprocating movement of the polishing fixture over the glassplate.NOTE 10: Use of the above polishing procedure, wherein the specimen and its fixture are moved upon a stationary glass plate,risks the generation of random deep scratches on the beveled surface due to accumulated coarse debris on the polishing plate. Ithas been found that using a rotating glass plate while holding the specimen mounting fixture so that the leading edge of thebeveled chip always faces into the direction of plate rotation reduces the risk. However, if each chip to be beveled is positionedat the same, or nearly the same, radial distance from the plate's center of rotation, uneven wear of the plate in the form of achannel, or wide groove, is likely to result. Such channeling of the polishing plate can be minimized or eliminated either bymoving the specimen mounting fixture slowly along the plate radius while polishing, or by choosing a different radial position onthe plate for each chip to be beveled. 12.6 Clean and inspect the specimen periodically to determine whether an adequate amount of specimen surface hasbeen exposed by beveling (see Note 5).12.7 Repeat 12.5 and 12.6 as necessary until an adequate extent of beveled surface is obtained.NOTE 11: At the beginning of the beveling process an extremely small area of silicon supports the static load of the polishingassembly, and pressures on the silicon are extremely high. To minimize the possibility of fracture of the edge of the silicon chip,it has been found advisable to begin bevel polishing with a relatively slow rate of motion of the polishing assembly. 12.8 When the desired amount of specimen surface has been exposed by beveling, thoroughly clean the specimenby flushing or swabbing with the appropriate organic solvent (see 11.2). Inspect the beveled surface for quality of

Compare the finish with the appropriate photograph of Figure 2, which shows resultsobtainable with different size diamond in the range specified for two types of motion during polishing. Repolishlightly if the finish appears to be significantly coarser than that shown in the appropriate photograph. Use dry air ornitrogen to blow the specimen surface dry prior to carrying out any spreading resistance measurements.NOTE 12: Clean the polishing plate regularly to remove coarse polishing residue or air-borne contaminants. This cleaning canbe done with a lintfree cloth or paper wipe and the same solvent used to clean polishing residue from the specimen. Inspect theplate when clean. If it shows signs of scratching, burnish marks, or areas where the lapped finish has been polished smooth, relapthe plate then clean thoroughly to remove lapping debris and broken-in on scrap samples (see Note 13).NOTE 13: A newly-frosted glass plate may not yield optimum results. Such a plate can be improved by preparing a number ofsamples of scrap silicon before beveling the test specimen of interest. The best indicator of frosted glass plate condition is thequality and uniformity of surface damage on the finished bevel. a. 0.1 m Diamond, b. 0.1 m Diamond, c. 0.5 m Diamond,Reciprocating Motion Figure-of-Eight Motion Reciprocating MotionFigure 2Surface Texture of Silicon Specimens Bevel-Sectioned with Diamond Against Ground-Glass Surface 13 Keywords13.1 beveling; diamond polishing; resistivity; resistivity variations; sample preparation; semiconductor; silicon;spreading resistance; spreading resistance probe (SRP) NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for anyparticular application.

SEMI MF928-0305 © SEMI 20051 SEMI MF928-0305TEST METHODS FOR EDGE CONTOUR OF CIRCULARSEMICONDUCTOR WAFERS AND RIGID DISK SUBSTRATES These test methods were technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and are the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication bythe North American Regional Standards Committee on December 10, 2004 Initially available atwww.semi.org January 2005; to be published March 2005. Original edition published by ASTMInternational as ASTM F 928-85. Last previous edition SEMI MF928-02.1 Purpose1.1 The edges of circular wafers of electronic materials are frequently required to be shaped after cutting the wafersfrom the ingot. Contouring the wafer edge reduces the incidence of chipping and minimizes epitaxial edge crownand photoresist edge bead during subsequent processing of the wafer. Similarly, edges of rigid disk substrates arefrequently edge shaped.1.2 The test methods described here provide means to determine that the wafer edge contour is appropriate to meetspecifications, such as SEMI M1 or SEMI M9, which are intended to provide wafers avoiding the difficultiesenumerated above. 2 Scope2.1 These test methods provide means for examining the edge contour of circular wafers of silicon, galliumarsenide, and other electronic materials, and determining fit to limits of contour specified by a template that definesa permitted zone through which the contour must pass. Principal application of such a template is intended for, butnot limited to, wafers that have been deliberately edge shaped.NOTE 1: DIN 50441/2 is equivalent to Method B of this standard. It is the responsibility of DIN Committee NMP 221. DIN50441/2, Measurement of the Geometric Dimensions of Semiconductor Slices; Testing of Edge Rounding, is available fromBeuth Verlag GmbH, Burggrafenstrasse 6, 10787 Berlin, Germany, Telephone: 49.30.2601-0, Fax: 49.30.2601.1263, Website:www.beuth.de.2.2 Two test methods are described.2.2.1 Method A is destructive and is limited to inspection of discrete points on the periphery, including flats. Thecontour of deliberately edge-shaped wafers may not be uniform around the entire periphery, and thus the discretelocation(s) may or may not be representative of the entire periphery.2.2.2 Method A is recommended for examining the edge profile of flatted regions of the wafer.2.2.3 Method A is best suited for referee purposes.2.3 Method B is nondestructive and suitable for inspection of all points on the wafer periphery except flats.2.3.1 Method B is appropriate for routine process monitoring such as alignment of wafer edge grinders, routinequality control and incoming/outgoing inspection purposes. In view of the uncertainty of precisely locating theintersection of the contour and the wafer surface when carrying out Method B, use of this method for commercialtransactions is not recommended unless the parties to the test establish the degree of correlation that can be obtained.2.3.2 Method B may also be applied to the examination of the edge contour of the outer periphery of substrates forrigid disks used for magnetic storage of data; metallic rigid disk substrates cannot conveniently be cleaved.NOTE 2: Reference to wafers in the remainder of this standard shall be interpreted to include substrates for rigid disks unless thephrase of electronic materials is also included in the context.2.4 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard. The values given in parentheses are forinformation only.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.

&lt;!-- Page 26 --&gt;

SEMI MF928-0305 © SEMI 2005 2 3 Limitations3.1 In Method B, the profile of the parallel surfaces of the wafer may not be sharply focused at distances exceedingapproximately 0.5 mm (0.020 in.) from the extreme wafer edge toward the wafer center. This uncertainty in thewafer surface location may cause inaccuracy in positioning the wafer with respect to template lines. It may alsomake it difficult to determine whether the wafer edge profile lies within the permitted zone at point B of thetemplate (see Figure 1). These difficulties can be overcome by aligning a straight edge to the wafer surface by directcontact, observing the shadow extension in the sharply focused region, and extrapolating the straight line edge of thetemplate reference. In applying this technique, exercise care to avoid damaging or contaminating the wafer surface.3.1.1 This limitation renders Method B unsuitable for determining the distance between the front and back wafersurfaces. The edge contours near the front and back surfaces of the wafer must be inspected separately.3.2 In Method B, attempting to view the complete wafer periphery, except flats, through wafer rotation maynecessitate frequent focus adjustment due to variations in wafer roundness and fixturing precision, including wafercentering.3.3 By either test method, any foreign material such as large particles or high spots on the wafer surface in the lightpath will present a false edge contour by masking the true contour shape.3.4 It is not always feasible to provide a uniform radius or bevel to the edges of wafers because silicon, galliumarsenide, and many other electronic materials as well as glass disk substrates are both hard and brittle. Wear ofgrinding tools, process variations, and the presence of flats on the circumference of wafers cause practical contoursto have varying shapes. For this reason, templates are used that define an allowed range.3.5 If a television system is used, the user is cautioned that distortions in the horizontal and vertical deflections mayoccur (see 9.2). 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specifications for Polished Monocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI M9  Specifications for Polished Monocrystalline Gallium Arsenide Slices4.2 ANSI Standard1 ANSI/ASQC Z1.4  Sampling Procedures and Tables for Inspection by AttributesNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Summary of Test Methods5.1 Both test methods employ optical means to project a shadow of the edge contour at substantial magnification ona screen.5.1.1 In applying Method A (destructive) the sample wafer is cleaved or broken along a diameter. A sharplyfocused image of the cross section of the wafer is obtained over a sufficiently large region near the edge with the aidof an optical comparator or projection microscope.5.1.2 In Method B (nondestructive) the unbroken wafer is back lighted with collimated (parallel) light such that asharply defined shadow of the wafer edge is projected on a screen. In this test method the wafer is not altered in anyway.5.2 By either test method, the contour of the wafer edge profile image is compared to a template that has beenmounted or projected on the screen. The template defines a permitted zone through which the edge contour mustpass. 1 American National Standards Institute, New York Office: 25 West 43rd Street, New York, NY 10036, USA.

SEMI MF928-0305 © SEMI 20053 6 Apparatus6.1 For Method A, an optical comparator or projection microscope capable of 100 magnification with viewingscreen large enough to permit display of an area 1 mm by 1 mm (0.04 in. by 0.04 in.).6.2 For Method B, a collimated light source (coherent or incoherent) and a television system, consisting of acamera, lenses to give 100 magnification and TV monitor capable of displaying a 1 by 1 mm (0.04 by 0.04 in.)area.NOTE 3: An adjustable camera mount, slice holding fixture, or lens adjustment is desirable for sharp focusing. 6.3 Fixture, for holding the wafer to be tested. The fixture must provide means for positioning the wafer such thatthe plane of the surface of the wafer is parallel to the viewing direction. The fixture should be arranged in such away that its position and orientation in a plane perpendicular to the viewing direction can be adjusted conveniently,or alternatively, the template can be moved. Optionally, for Method B, the fixture can provide means for rotation ofthe wafer about its axis of symmetry. The design of the fixture for Method B should be such that the wafer may beloaded, held in position, and unloaded with minimum risk of contamination or damage to the wafer.6.4 Template, having transparent regions defining the area through which the contour of the edge of the wafer mustpass and a semi-transparent region bounding the space. An example of a template is given in Figure 1. Instructionsfor constructing templates are given in 10. NOTE: Only half is used to emphasize that these methods are not intended for measurement of thickness.Figure 1Template Showing One Half of Wafer Cross Section 6.5 Gage Block or Precision Rod, with dimensions approximately the same as the thickness of the wafer to betested and accurately known for use in establishing the magnification of the apparatus.6.6 Rule, 150 mm (6 in.) long with scale gradations of 0.5 mm (0.02 in.) or less. 7 Sampling7.1 Unless otherwise specified, ANSI/ASQC Z1.4 shall be used. Inspection levels shall be agreed upon betweenthe supplier and purchaser.7.2 The number and location of the test points on the periphery of each wafer shall be agreed upon between thesupplier and purchaser. 8 Specimen Preparation8.1 For Method A, cleave or fracture the wafer along a diameter.NOTE 4: This may be conveniently accomplished by positioning the wafer over a small diameter rod and pressing downward onboth sides. Alignment by eye is sufficient. If required by the sampling plan, cleave additional pieces along the edge of the wafer. 9 Determination of Magnification Factor9.1 For Method A, adjust the comparator or microscope to the magnification to be used for the test. Using a gageblock or precision rod of accurately known dimensions, follow the comparator or microscope manufacturer'sinstructions to establish object-to-image magnification to three significant figures.

&lt;!-- Page 28 --&gt;

SEMI MF928-0305 © SEMI 2005 4 9.2 For Method B, position a gage block on the fixture (see 6.3) such that the known dimension can be measuredin the vertical direction on the screen using an appropriate rule. Measure the image vertical dimension to the nearest0.02 in. (0.5 mm) and adjust magnification until the desired magnification for the test is obtained. Reposition thegage block such that the screen image of the known dimension can be measured in the horizontal direction. Adjustmagnification to give the same value as the vertical.NOTE 5: Television systems may have distortions in either vertical or horizontal deflection circuits caused by improper settingsof vertical or horizontal size or linearity. If magnification in both horizontal and vertical directions is not equal to the desiredresolution, recalibration of the television system may be required. 10 Preparation of Template10.1 Multiply each of the chosen or specified template coordinates by the magnification factor.10.2 Prepare on transparent material a full-scale template having the dimensions calculated in 10.1 with aprojected image accuracy of ± 0.5 mm (± 0.020 in.).10.2.1 Mount the template on the screen such that the images of the wafer surfaces are parallel with thecorresponding template lines. Alternatively, the template can be electronically generated or projected by the opticalsystem. 11 Procedure11.1 Method A11.1.1 Mount the test specimen in the fixture with the cleaved or broken surface of the wafer facing the objectivelens and approximately perpendicular to the viewing direction.11.1.2 Adjust the comparator focus such that a sharp image of the wafer is seen on the screen.11.1.3 Position the wafer by appropriate motion of the fixture so that the contour profile image is tangent to theoverlay template at both the edge and front surface.11.1.4 Determine whether or not the contour of the edge of the wafer between the points of tangency lies entirelywithin the permitted zone of the template. If the specification has other requirements, such as those relating to thespecific shape of the profile, inspect the profile image for adherence to such conditions.11.1.5 Repeat 11.1.3 and 11.1.4 with the opposite side of the contour profile image tangent to the overlaytemplate at both the edge and the back surface.11.1.6 If the test specimen includes the full diameter, reverse the fixture on the comparator table to permit the edgecontour at the opposite end of the wafer diameter to be seen on the screen and repeat 11.1.2 through 11.1.5.11.1.7 If additional parts of the wafer were prepared as test specimens, repeat 11.1.1 through 11.1.5 for each.11.1.8 Record as passed those wafers for which all observed edge contours lie entirely within the permitted zoneand which meet all other specification requirements.11.2 Method B11.2.1 Mount a whole wafer in the fixture.11.2.2 Adjust the focus of the apparatus to give the sharpest image of the extreme edge of the wafer as seen on thescreen.11.2.3 Position the wafer by appropriate motion of the fixture so that the contour profile image is tangent to theoverlay template at both edge and front surface (see 3.1).11.2.4 Determine whether or not the contour of the edge of the wafer between the points of tangency lies entirelywithin the permitted zone of the template. If the specification has other requirements, such as those relating to thespecific shape of the profile, inspect the profile image for adherence to such conditions.11.2.5 Rotate the wafer in the fixture while continuously observing the contour. Due to diameter and roundnesstolerances, the specimen contour profile image may move with respect to the overlay template while rotating the

Adjust wafer or template position and focus as required to assure proper judgment of template fit.Repeat 11.2.3 and 11.2.4 at specified points in accordance with the sampling plan.NOTE 6: Flatted regions of the wafer periphery cannot be evaluated by this test method. 11.2.6 Repeat 11.2.3 through 11.2.5 with the opposite side of the contour profile image tangent to the overlaytemplate at both the edge and the back surface.11.2.7 Record as passed those wafers for which all edge contours examined lie entirely within the permitted zoneand which meet all other specification requirements. 12 Report12.1 Report as a minimum the following information:12.1.1 Date of test,12.1.2 Name of person conducting the test,12.1.3 The lot number of other identification of the material,12.1.4 Method used, A or B,12.1.5 Position(s) on the wafer periphery that were examined,12.1.6 The number of wafers in the lot,12.1.7 The number of test wafers, and12.1.8 The number of accepted wafers. 13 Precision and Bias13.1 Although these test methods do not return a test result, an interlaboratory test was conducted to determine thereliability of the nondestructive Method B when applied to silicon wafers. In this test, a lot of 25, 125 mm diameter,edge profiled, silicon wafers was tested in accordance with Method B against the edge contour template and otherrequirements of SEMI M1. The wafers were measured by nine different organizations using several types ofcommercially available edge contour measuring instruments, all of which had similar optical systems. In one casethe magnification used was 60 instead of 100 as specified in 6.2.13.1.1 In no case was a wafer judged to be within the specification requirements by all participants. Only threewafers were judged by all participants to fail, but different participants reported different reasons for failure; theother 22 wafers were judged to pass by some and to fail by others, but again the same failure mode was not alwaysreported. Most of the difficulty centered around determination of whether or not the edge profile extended furtherinto the wafer than 0.508 mm (the specified location of point B in the SEMI template). Some participants reportedfailure on the front of the wafer, some on the back, and some reported that failure occurred because the contourpassed inside point C. These results confirm the difficulties with locating the wafer surface indicated in 3.1. Noparticipant reported use of the straight-edge technique suggested in 3.1, so the efficacy of that procedure was notevaluated in the test.13.1.2 The results also confirmed the difficulties with interference from particulate contaminants. Severalobservers reported protrusions or sharp points on the wafer periphery, but these were not generally reported.Examination of the wafers under conditions in which the edge of the wafer could be accessed during the test showedthat such apparent protrusions could be removed by blowing or wiping with lens cleaning tissue.13.1.3 For more details, refer to the Research Report.2 13.2 At the recommended magnification, 100, a dimension of 25 m (0.001 in.) at the object plane produces ascreen image of 2.5 mm (0.1 in.). The smallest size details of edge contours to be inspected by these test methodsare of comparable dimensions. 2 Available on request from SEMI Headquarters, 3081 Zanker Road, San Jose, CA, Telephone 408-943-7021, Fax: 408-943-7015, e-mail:standards@semi.org.

SEMI MF847-0705 © SEMI 2003, 20051 SEMI MF847-0705TEST METHODS FOR MEASURING CRYSTALLOGRAPHICORIENTATION OF FLATS ON SINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON WAFERSBY X-RAY TECHNIQUES These test methods were technically approved by the global Silicon Wafer Committee. This edition wasapproved for publication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on April 7, 2005. It was availableat www.semi.org in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005. Original edition published by ASTMInternational as ASTM F 847-83. Last previous edition SEMI MF847-02. 1 Purpose1.1 The orientation of flats on silicon wafers is an important materials acceptance requirement. The flats are used insemiconductor device processing to provide consistent alignment of device geometries with respect tocrystallographic planes and directions.1.2 The orientation of a wafer flat is the orientation of the surface of the flat (on the edge of the wafer). Flats areusually specified with respect to a low-index plane, such as a (110) plane. In such cases the orientation of the flatmay be described in terms of its angular deviation from the low-index plane.1.3 This standard covers two test methods for determining flat orientation.1.4 Either one of these test methods is appropriate for process development and quality assurance applications.Until the interlaboratory precision of these test methods has been determined, it is not recommended that they beused between supplier and customer unless correlation studies are completed satisfactorily. 2 Scope2.1 These test methods cover the determination of, the angular deviation between the crystallographic orientationof the direction perpendicular to the plane of a fiducial flat on a circular silicon wafer, and the specified orientationof the flat in the plane of the wafer surface.2.2 These test methods are applicable for wafers with flat length values in the range of those specified for siliconwafers in SEMI M1. They are suitable for use only on wafers with angular deviations in the range from 5° to +5°.2.3 The orientation accuracy achieved by these test methods depends directly on the accuracy with which the flatsurface can be aligned with a reference fence and the accuracy of the orientation of the reference fence with respectto the X-ray beam.2.4 Two test methods are covered as follows: Test Method A  X-Ray Edge Diffraction Method 8 through 13 Test Method B  Laue Back Reflection X-Ray Method 14 through 182.4.1 Test Method A is nondestructive and is similar to Test Method A of SEMI MF26, except that it uses specialwafer holding fixtures to orient the wafer uniquely with respect to the X-ray goniometer. The technique is capableof measuring the crystallographic direction of flats to a greater precision than the Laue back reflection method.2.4.2 Test Method B is also nondestructive, and is similar to ASTM Test Method E 82, and to DIN 50 433, Part 3,except that it uses instant film and special fixturing to orient the flat with respect to the X-ray beam. Although itis simpler and more rapid, it does not have the precision of Test Method A because it uses less precise and lessexpensive fixturing and equipment. It produces a permanent film record of the test.NOTE 1: The Laue photograph may be interpreted to provide information regarding the crystallographic directions of wafermisorientation; however, this is beyond the scope of the present test method. Users desiring to carry out such interpretationshould refer to ASTM Test Method E 82, to DIN 50 433, Part 3, or to a standard X-ray textbook.1,2 With different wafer holdingfixturing, Test Method B is also applicable to determination of the orientation of a wafer surface. 1 Wood, E.

It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 The alignment of the flat against the reference fence may be affected by the straightness of the flat. In theunlikely event that the flat profile is convex, the flat orientation may not be unique. More often the flat surface willtouch the reference fence along two lines perpendicular to the wafer surface at two points. In this case, theorientation determined is that of the plane through the two lines on the plane perpendicular to the wafer surface thatpasses through the two points. In the latter cases, the orientation determined is that which is obtained in subsequentprocessing of the wafer when the alignment is between the flat and a reference fence.3.2 Misalignment of the various fixtures degrades both the interlaboratory reproducibility and the absolute accuracyof both test methods. The single-instrument repeatability is not degraded provided the fixturing is rigid. 4 Referenced Standards and Documents4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specifications for Polished Monocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI M59  Terminology for Silicon TechnologySEMI MF26  Test Methods for Determining the Orientation of a Semiconductive Single Crystal4.2 ASTM StandardsE 82  Test Method for Determining the Orientation of a Metal Crystal3 E 122  Practice for Choice of Sample Size to Estimate a Measure of Quality for a Lot or Process 4 4.3 DIN Standard50433, Part 3  Determination of the Orientation of Single Crystals by Means of Laue Back Scattering5 4.4 ANSI StandardANSI/ASQC Z1.4  Sampling Procedures and Tables for Inspection by Attributes6 4.5 Other StandardCode of Federal Regulations, Title 10, Part 20, Standards for Protection Against Radiation7 NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 Terms relating to silicon technology are defined in SEMI M59. 3 Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol 03.01, ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, PA 19428.

TEST METHOD A  X-RAY EDGE DIFFRACTION METHOD 8 Summary of Test Method8.1 In this test method a holding fixture that uniquely orients the wafer being tested with respect to its geometricfeatures is used to position the wafers with respect to the X-ray goniometer.8.2 The goniometer is rotated to determine the Bragg angle with respect to the geometric features by X-raydiffraction from the crystallographic planes of the wafer edge, first with the wafer front surface up and then withfront surface down.8.3 The average angular deviation is calculated from the goniometer readings. 9 Apparatus9.1 X-ray and Goniometer Apparatus  In accordance with 5.1 of SEMI MF26, except that the X-ray beam shallbe collimated using a vertical slit.9.2 Wafer-Holding Fixture, to orient the sample wafer uniquely with respect to the X-ray goniometer (see Figure 1).The fixture must include a vacuum hold-down with a flat horizontal surface and a reference fence perpendicular tothis surface. These components establish an x-y axis that is fixed with respect to the goniometer and the X-raybeam. The exact dimensions of the fixture depend on the layout of the X-ray apparatus. The critical features are:

This test yielded a distribution of calculated values of with a 1- value of1.94 min. TEST METHOD B  LAUE BACK REFLECTION X-RAY METHOD 14 Summary of Test Method14.1 In this test method the wafer is mounted in a Laue back-reflection X-ray camera and a collimated beam ofwhite (continuous or Bremsstrahlung) radiation is directed at the wafer flat.14.2 A spot is produced on the film for each set of crystal planes that satisfies the Bragg equation for anywavelength component of the impinging radiation.14.3 The pattern on the film is read with an engineering drafting head.14.4 When the flat surface is within 5° of the specified low-index plane, the angle between the nearest zone of Lauespots that goes through the center of the pattern and the zero reference line is a direct measure of the angulardeviation. 15 Apparatus15.1 Commercially Available X-Ray Diffraction Apparatus  Utilizing a silver or tungsten tube as the X-ray sourceand including a shutter to control the X-ray exposure.15.2 Laue Back-Reflection X-ray Camera  With the following features (see Figure 3):15.2.1 Mounting Track  With the upper surface and one side round precision flat perpendicular to each other,aligned with the X-ray beam from the source.15.2.2 Wafer Holding Fixture  On which two plane surfaces are ground so that when it is clamped to themounting track one surface is perpendicular and the other is parallel with the horizontal (upper) surface of themounting track to 1 min of arc (29 m in 100 mm) (see Figure 4). The vertical surface contains holes connected to avacuum line through a fitting on the back of the fixture. In use, the flat is aligned to the horizontal reference surfaceand the vacuum holds the wafer against the vertical surface.

SEMI MF847-0705 © SEMI 2003, 20057 15.2.3 Camera  having a film holder with provision for establishing precisely a horizontal reference line. This isconveniently done by installing a light source with two light pipes and 75 m (0.003 in.) diameter light collimatorsat the midpoint of the shorter dimension of the film, as near to the edges of the sensitive area of the film as possible(see Figure 5). A tube for collimating the X-ray beam is required at the center of the film holder (see Figure 3). NOTE: Use of high-speed instant film together with a fluorescent screen results in shorter test times than with wet-processedfilms. 8 A holder of this type is commercially available. This holder has built into it four reference spots which define twoorthogonal lines which pass through the center of the film when the X-ray beam collimator is located (these reference spots arenot utilized in the present test method). If this type of holder is used, the collimator tube must not protrude above the surface ofthe fluorescent screen because of film and clip interference problems during loading and processing of the film.Figure 3Photograph of Assembled View of Laue Camera and Wafer Holder Figure 4Photograph of Wafer Holding Fixture andMounting Track Figure 5Section of Laue Camera Platen Showing Light Pipeand Collimating Tube 8 Schmidt, P.

SEMI MF951-0305 © SEMI 2003, 20051 SEMI MF951-0305TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF RADIAL INTERSTITIALOXYGEN VARIATION IN SILICON WAFERS These test methods were technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and are the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication bythe North American Regional Standards Committee on December 10, 2004. Initially available atwww.semi.org January 2005; to be published March 2005. Original edition published by ASTMInternational as ASTM F 951-85. Last previous edition SEMI MF951-02.1 Purpose1.1 The presence of oxygen can be beneficial to certain manufacturing operations by preventing the formation ofprocess-induced defects. To the extent that this is true, it becomes important that the oxygen be uniformlydistributed over the entire slice.1.2 Multiple test plans are included to satisfy a variety of requirements. The characteristic shape and magnitude ofoxygen concentration distributions in crystals are functions of the crystal growth process. Although the specifiedtest plans are intended to cover oxygen concentration distributions which are typically found, other distributionsmay occur. In such cases, it may be necessary to use test positions other than those specified in order to adequatelydescribe the distribution pattern.1.3 This test method may be used for process control, research and development, and materials acceptancepurposes. In the absence of an interlaboratory evaluation of the precision of this test method, its use for materialsacceptance is not recommended unless the parties involved establish the degree of correlation which can be expected(see 12). 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers test site selection and data reduction procedures for radial variation of the interstitialoxygen concentration in silicon slices typically used in the manufacture of microelectronic semiconductor devices.2.2 This test method is intended as both a referee and production test through selection of an appropriate testposition plan.2.3 The interstitial oxygen content may be measured in accordance with SEMI MF1188, SEMI MF1619, DIN50438/1, JEITA EM-3504, or any other procedure agreed upon by the parties to the test.NOTE 1: SEMI MF1366 is not based on infrared absorption measurement and it measures total oxygen content, not interstitialoxygen content. It is also a destructive technique. However, it can be used to determine the radial variation of the oxygencontent if suitable modifications of the test procedure are made.2.4 Acceptable thickness and surface finish for the test specimens are specified in the applicable test methods. Thistest method is suitable for use on chemically etched, single-side polished and double-side polished silicon wafers orslices with no surface defects that could adversely change infrared radiation transmission through the test specimen(subsequently called slice), provided that appropriate test methods for oxygen content are selected.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Variations of optical thickness can be caused by thickness or surface finish variations, or both.3.2 Beam size differences from instrument to instrument can cause errors when the beam area is smaller than theaperture used in this test method.

SEMI MF1049-0304 © SEMI 2003, 20041 SEMI MF1049-0304PRACTICE FOR SHALLOW ETCH PIT DETECTION ON SILICONWAFERS This practice was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication bythe North American Regional Standards Committee on December 4, 2003. Initially available atwww.semi.org February 2004; to be published March 2004. Originally published by ASTM International asASTM F 1049-87. Last previous edition SEMI MF1049-02.1 Purpose1.1 High levels of etch pits are reported1 to indicatemetallic contamination that is detrimental to waferprocessing. This can be deduced from the density ofetch pits on the surface of the wafer.1.2 This practice is used to detect shallow etch pits thatmay be related to the level of metallic impurities nearthe surface of silicon epitaxial or polished wafers. 2 Scope2.1 This practice covers detection of high densities ofshallow etch pits on silicon wafers doped either p- or n-type and with resistivities as low as 0.005 Ωcm. Thispractice is applicable for silicon wafers cut fromcrystals grown in either a (111) or (100) crystalorientation.2.2 This practice is not recommended for use in defectdensity evaluations, but as a subjective means ofestimating defect densities and distributions on thesurface of a polished or epitaxial wafer.NOTE 1: For determination of shallow and other defectdensities in wafer production environments, use of thesequence of procedures in SEMI MF 1726, SEMI MF1727,SEMI MF1809, and SEMI MF1810 is recommended.2.3 This practice utilizes a thermal oxidation processfollowed by a chemical preferential etchant to createand then delineate shallow etch pits.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior touse. 3 Limitations3.1 Etch artifacts are the primary cause of difficulty inidentifying shallow etch pits. Etch artifacts aregenerated in various ways such as gas bubble formation 1 Pearce, C. W., and McMahon, R. G., Role of Metallic Contamina-tion in the Formation of Saucer Pit Defects in Epitaxial Silicon, J.Vac. Sci. Tech., 14, 40 (1977). during etching, improperly cleaned surface prior toetching, or insufficient etch solution volume.3.2 Excessive silicon staining (very dark color) duringthe preferential etching may obscure or prevent thedevelopment of shallow etch pits on heavily doped p-type silicon material (&lt;0.2 Ωcm). 2 NOTE 2: Light staining will not affect subsequent defect etchresults. However, heavy stains are undesirable. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI C54  Specifications and Guidelines forOxygenSEMI C59  Specifications and Guidelines forNitrogenSEMI C28  Specifications and Guidelines forHydrofluoric AcidSEMI M17 Guide for a Universal Wafer GridSEMI MF154  Guide for Identification of Structuresand Contaminants Seen on Specular Silicon SurfacesSEMI MF1726  Practice for Analysis ofCrystallographic Perfection of Silicon WafersSEMI MF1727  Practice for Detection of OxidationInduced Defects in Polished Silicon Wafers3 SEMI MF1809  Guide for Selection and Use ofEtching Solutions to Delineate Structural Defects inSiliconSEMI MF1810  Test Method for CountingPreferentially Etched or Decorated Surface Defects inSilicon Wafers4.2 ASTM StandardD 5127  Guide for Ultra Pure Water Used in theElectronics and Semiconductor Industry 3 2 Schimmel, D.

The light beam shall notbe collimated and shall be capable of forming an imageof the bulb filament at the lamp focus length.NOTE 3: Some standard microscope illuminators meet theserequirements. 7.2 Hydrofluoric Acid-Proof Chemical LaboratoryApparatus  Fluorocarbon, polyethylene, orpolypropylene beakers, graduates, tweezers, eyeprotection, apron, gloves, and protective sleeves.7.3 Wafer Holders  HF acid-proof wafer carrierswhich hold wafers. These are required if more than onewafer is to be etched at a time.7.4 Optical Microscope  Equipped with interferencecontrast attachment. The eyepiece and objective lens incombination shall give 200 to 1000 magnification.NOTE 4: Nomarski differential interference contrast is anexample of interference contrast. 7.4.1 Stage Micrometer  With divisions of 0.002 mmor finer, if an estimate of the shallow etch pit density isto be made.7.5 Acid Sink  A fume hood and facilities fordisposing of acids and their vapors.7.6 Spin Dryer  Used to dry the wafers. Althoughthis item is not required, it is useful to provide a surfacefree of residue artifacts. 8 Reagents and Materials8.1 Purity of Reagents  Reagents for which SEMIspecifications have not been developed shall conform tothe specifications of the Committee of AnalyticalReagents of the American Chemical Society 4. Othergrades may be used provided it is first ascertained thatthe reagent is of sufficiently high purity to permit itsuse without lessening the accuracy of the determination.8.1.1 Hydrofluoric Acid (HF)  concentrated, inaccordance with Grade 1 of SEMI C28.8.1.2 Nitrogen (N 2)  99.998% purity, in accordancewith Grade 4.8 of SEMI C59.8.1.3 Oxygen (O 2)  99.98% purity, in accordancewith SEMI C54.8.2 Purity of Water  Reference to water shall beunderstood to mean Type E-3 or better water asdescribed in ASTM Guide D 5127.8.3 Schimmel Etch for (100) and (111) Surfaces5 8.3.1 Chromic Acid Solution  Make a 0.75 Msolution by placing 75 g of chromium trioxide (CrO 3) ina 1-L glass volumetric flask and then add sufficientwater to make a solution volume of 1 L, or 1000 mL.The solution may be stored up to 6 months in cleanglass, TFE-fluorocarbon, polyethylene, orpolypropylene bottles.8.3.2 For Test Specimens with Resistivity Greater Than0.2Ω!cm n- or p-Type  Immediately before using,add 2 parts hydrofluoric acid (HF) to 1 part chromicacid solution by volume.

SEMI MF1049-0304 © SEMI 2003, 20043 add 2 parts hydrofluoric acid (HF) to 1 part chromicacid solution and 1.5 parts water by volume. Prepareand mix in HF-proof beakers.8.3.4 The specified chemicals shall have the followingnominal assay: Chromium trioxide &gt;98.0% Hydrofluoric acid, concentrated 49 ± 0.25%8.3.5 The chemicals used in this evaluation procedureare potentially harmful and must be handled in an acidexhaust fume hood, with utmost care at all times. 9 Sampling9.1 Select wafers to represent the lot to be tested asspecified in producer-consumer agreements. 10 Specimen Preparation10.1 In most instances this practice may be used forpolished or epitaxial wafers as they are received, but ifcleaning is required, the parties using this practice mustestablish a mutually acceptable cleaning procedureprior to etching. 11 Procedure11.1 Handle wafers only with a clean, nonmetallicpickup tool or automated transfer unit to avoidscratching or contaminating the surface.11.2 Oxidize the wafers by the thermal sequence listedin Table 1.NOTE 5: Large diameter furnaces may have difficulty induplication of this process. Rapid thermal processing is anacceptable alternative.11.2.1 Preheat the furnace to the push temperature.11.2.2 Load the specimen wafers into the wafer boat,being careful to avoid binding, scratching, orcontamination.Table 1 Shallow Pit Oxidation ProcedureStep Function ConditionsAmbient 1% O 2, 99% N 2Temperature 950°CPush (Load) Push Rate 60 cm/min.Ambient 1% O 2, 99% N 2Temperature 950°COxidation Time 7 minAmbient 1% O 2, 99% N 2Temperature 950°CPull (Unload) Pull Rate 60 cm/min. 11.2.3 Insert the boat into the hot zone at the rate calledfor in Table 1. The wafer boat shall be centered in theuniform hot zone.11.2.4 Follow the oxidation and pull procedures asspecified in Table 1.11.2.5 Because silicon wafers and quartz accessoriesare extremely hot when they are removed from theoxidation furnace, allow the materials adequate time tocool before handling.11.3 Transfer the room temperature wafers from thequartz boat to a wafer holder using the pickup tool orautomated transfer unit.11.4 Remove the thermal oxide layer usinghydrofluoric acid for 2 min followed by water rinse anddry, using the spin dryer, if available.11.4.1 Caution  Hydrofluoric acid solutions, usedhere and for etching, are particularly hazardous andspecific preventive measures must be strictly observed.Safety or protective gear should be worn while handlingacid solutions. Safety requirements vary, but theessentials are: acid sink and personnel coveringincluding plastic gloves, safety glasses, face shield, acidgown, and shoe covers. Hydrofluoric acid solutionsshould not be used by anyone who is not familiar withthe specific preventive measures and first aid treatmentsgiven in the appropriate Material Safety Data Sheet.11.5 Etch the wafers for 2 minutes in an adequateamount of Schimmel etch appropriate for the waferresistivity (see Sections 8.3.2 and 8.3.3). If the defectetch pits are too small to distinguish, increase the etchtime up to 5 min.11.5.1 Warning: Chromic acid, contained in the defectetch solutions, should not be released into drains thatlead directly to domestic sewers. Chromates are anextreme eco-hazard and must be first treated by reduc-tion to the trivalent form. Chromic acid is a strongoxidizing agent and should not be allowed to contactorganic solvents or other easily oxidized materials.11.6 Quickly transfer the loaded wafer holder into awater bath to rinse the wafers.11.7 Dry the wafers, using the spin dryer, if available. 12 Evaluation12.1 View the wafers at 1 magnification under thehigh-intensity, narrow-beam light source in a darkhood. If haze is observed, further examine the etchedwafer under a minimum of 200 magnification toestablish if the haze is due to shallow etch pits. If noshallow etch pits are seen, record the wafer as beingfree of shallow etch pits.
