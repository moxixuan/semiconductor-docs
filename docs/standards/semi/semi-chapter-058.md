This is left to componentimplementors.2.7 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Provisional Status  This spe cification isdesignated as provisional due to known areas that needto be completed. The following items summarize thedeficiencies of the provisional specification to beaddressed before a subsequent ballot to upgrade it tofull standard status.3.1.1 Dependence on Factory Opera tions Component The Scheduling Component provides specificationsof activities that are executed by the Factory OperationsComponent in the form of production jobs, transportjobs and maintenance jobs. The specification of FactoryOperations may require changes to the activityspecification properties of the Scheduling Component.When the Specification for CIM Framework Factory Operations Component is complete, this dependencycan be resolved.3.1.2 Specification of Event Subscrip tions  TheScheduling Component maintains a current status of thefactory resources and material by receiving eventnotifications of occurrences that indicate changes inother components. Events are specified with thecomponent responsible for publishing the eventnotifications. Until all of the required event formats aredefined as part of the publishing componentspecification, the inputs to the Scheduling Componentwill be defined only in general terms. When eventspecifications are complete, these event subscriptionscan be specified.3.1.3 Initialization  The Schedulin g Componentdoes not currently provide interfaces that allow therepresentation of factory conditions to be initialized forthe start-up of dispatching and scheduling. The additionof initialization interfaces will be added or deemed outof scope prior to upgrade to full standard status. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E81  Provisional Specification for CIMFramework Domain Architecture

Activities maybe specified formally by a predefined type of jobspecification (for example, Production Job, TransportJob or PM Job), or they may be represented byidentifying the minimal set of resources and materialneeded to allow subsequent completion of the jobspecification. An activity is the result of dispatching orscheduling.5.1.2 dispatching  generation of a decision or optionfor the next activity involving a particular factoryresource or material. The dispatch result is determinedby evaluating the current state of the factory, thepriorities and requirements for the activities, and therelationship of the activities to one another. Dispatchingreturns only the immediately applicable part of aschedule.5.1.3 factory planning  recommen dation of lot startsfor a particular production facility over an extendedperiod of time. The factory plan is determined bypredicting future changes in factory state and availablecapacity as lots progress through production. Thisprediction is used to determine the optimum sequenceof lot starts to best achieve the production goals of thefacility. Factory planning is typically the responsibilityof enterprise systems.5.1.4 scheduling  generation of a forecast of futuretime sequenced activities involving factory resources ormaterial.

Scheduling covers activities projected tooccur over a longer future time interval thandispatching. 6 Requirements6.1 Scheduling Component  The SchedulingComponent provides a single interface called theSchedulingManager with operations for bothdispatching and scheduling.6.1.1 Any resource or material withi n the factory mayhave a next activity defined for it. TheSchedulingManager interface is responsible foridentifying activities that answer questions such as: Whats next for this Machine? Where next for this Lot? Whats next for this Operator?6.1.2 The SchedulingManager interf ace is alsoresponsible for generating a time-sequenced forecast offuture activities for a resource or for material within thefactory. This forecast is based on projections from thecurrent factory state and may be updated as actualactivities are dispatched and executed.6.1.3 The Scheduling Component In formation Modelis shown in Figure 2.

SEMI E105-0701 © SEMI 2000, 200111 RELATED INFORMATION 1IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR INPUT OF FACTORY STATEINFORMATION TO THE SCHEDULING COMPONENT NOTE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E105. This related information was approved for publication byfull letter ballot procedures on August 28, 2000.NOTE: This related information is included with the Scheduling Component specification to aid the readers in understanding theintent and use of the standard.R1-1 The Scheduling Component has two types of interfaces:A. Scheduling and Dispatching Service Interface - this is the interface for services provided by the SchedulingComponent in response to requests from the Factory Operations Component or some other client. It alsoincludes interfaces to support asynchronous actions for an active scheduler or dispatcher which provides thesame information content on an event driven basis rather than requiring a client request.This is included within the scope of the current standard.B. Scheduling and Dispatching Factory Input Interface - this is the interface used by other components to provideupdated information on factory state used by the Scheduling Component in making scheduling and dispatchingdecisions. The updates are typically provided by other CIM Framework components to the SchedulingComponent asynchronously.This is NOT included within the scope of the current standard.R1-2 The goal for CIM Framework standards is to eventually standardize both of these types of interface. However,at this time there are two major issues that prevent inclusion of the Factory Input Interface to the SchedulingComponent.1. There is inadequate consensus on the technical maturity of the currently available asynchronous inputmechanisms. While the CIM Framework specifies events for delivery via an Event Broker mechanism, it is notassumed that the quality of service for events will include guaranteed delivery and performance adequate forkeeping a Scheduling Component current with real-time factory state changes. For a more complete discussionof the CIM Framework technical architecture issues, see SEMI E96.2. Some key components of the CIM Framework needed to provide factory state to the Scheduling Componenthave not yet been approved as SEMI standards.R1-3 The following approach is suggested as a possible way to address Scheduling Component Input in the future:1. Identify the most important inputs required by the Scheduling Component in a follow-on ballot for theScheduling Component to be used during the interim period until the full component specifications containingthose events are approved as SEMI standards.2. Suppliers who implement the Scheduling Component should take advantage of existing standard interfacesdefined in adopted CIM framework standards and use this experience as expert input on future updates to thisstandard.3. Encourage technical studies to provide added understanding of the tradeoffs and limitations that impactstandardization of this interface in the future.

This related information was approved for publication byfull letter ballot procedures on August 28, 2000.These scenarios show possible implementations of the SEMI Scheduling Component. The information shown here isintended to be a guide rather than describe prescriptive implementation rules. Some of the message sequences andimplied functionality included in these scenarios will vary across different implementations.This section focuses primarily on the interface between the Scheduling Component and factory operationscomponent.

SEMI E107-1102 © SEMI 2001, 20021 SEMI E107-1102SPECIFICATION OF ELECTRIC FAILURE LINK DATA FORMAT FORYIELD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM This specification was technically approved by the Global Information & Control Committee and is the directresponsibility of the Japanese Information & Control Committee. Current edition approved by the JapaneseRegional Standards Committee on July 19, 2002. Initially available at www.semi.org October 2002; to bepublished November 2002. Originally published March 2001; previously published November 2001. 1 Purpose1.1 The objective of this document is standardizationof the specific data format passed from the testequipment to the Yield Management System. The YieldManagement System is a kind of data server for detailtest data and geometrical defect data of patterns on awafer as described in the Terminology section of thisdocument.1.2 This document assumes a Yield ManagementSystem in which test equipment electrical failureinformation is managed and analyzed in an integratedmanner. Examples of test equipment failure informationinclude bit map data, bin data, and inpsectioninformation obtained by devices such as waferinspection equipment and review tools. Standardizationof the data file format helps to reduce the developmentburden on customers and related vendors. 2 Scope2.1 This document specifies the data file format fortransferring from test equipment to a YieldManagement System.2.2 This document is an extension of the general mapdata item standard, i.e. SEMI G81, and the general mapdata format document, currently under development.This document does not redefine the generalspecification.2.3 The scope of this document is just defining dataitems and their formats. Data file creation methods,data creating environments and file naming conventionsare outside of the scope of this document. Also,communication protocols to transfer the data arebeyond the scope of this document.2.4 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This standard defines extensional data for YMSLink Data map for generic test data map standardized by SEMI G81 and G85, data format of each item forYMS Link Data is defined independently as extradefinition here. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E5  SEMI Equipment CommunicationStandard 2 Message Content (SECS-II)SEMI E30.1  Inspection and Review SpecificEquipment Model (ISEM)SEMI G81  Specification for Map Data ItemsSEMI G85  Specification for Map Data FormatNOTE 1: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents citedshall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Defintions5.1.1 analog data  One of three categories of data:measured values such as voltage or current obtainedwhen test equipment measures a semiconductordevices electrical characteristics, parameter valueswhich are test parameters when measuring, and limitvalues which are decision parameters if test results arepass or fail.5.1.2 bin data  same as Category below.5.1.3 category  data indicating the type of electricfailure or rank of characteristics of die tested by the testequipment.

SEMI E109-0305 © SEMI 2001, 2005 4 6 Requirements6.1 Reticle and Pod Management compliant equipment is required to provide certain capabilities defined by otherstandards: accessibility to status information, event reporting, alarm management, and equipment control. Theserequirements shall be satisfied through compliance to the following sets of standards:6.2 Generic Equipment Model Standard (GEM) SEMI E30 Event Notification Status Data Collection Equipment Constants Alarm Management Equipment Control Remote Control Error Messages Dynamic Event Report Configuration6.3 Object-Based Standards Object Services Standard (SEMI E39) Event Reporting (SEMI E53) Exception Management (SEMI E41) 7 Conventions7.1 Objects7.1.1 Whenever the equipment is required to know about specific kinds of entities, and required to manageinformation concerning these entities, it is useful to treat these entities as objects that comply with the basicrequirements of SEMI E39 (OSS). This is especially true whenever there are a large number of objects of a giventype or when the entities are transient rather than permanent. In both cases, it is difficult to describe a general wayfor the host and equipment to specify which particular entity is referenced and to get information related only to aspecific one out of many.7.1.2 By defining these entities as objects that comply with SEMI E39, it is only necessary for the host to specifythe type of object and its specific identifier in order to inquire about one or more properties of the specific entity ofinterest.7.1.3 Object Properties7.1.3.1 A property (attribute) is information about an individual object that is presented as a name/value pair. Thename is a formally reserved text string that represents the property, and the value is the current setting for thatproperty.7.1.3.2 Properties shall be accessible to the host via the service GetAttr and SetAttr for the Reticle Pod object,Reticle object, and Reticle location object: get the list of IDs for the current reticle pods at the equipment, and get the specified properties for one or more individual reticle pods.7.1.4 Rules for Object Properties Attributes with RO access can not be changed using SetAttr service as defined in OSS. Attributes with RW access can be changed using SetAttr service as defined in OSS.

&lt;!-- Page 45 --&gt;

SEMI E109-0305 © SEMI 2001, 20055  Additional attributes may be specified by the user or the equipment supplier by using an attribute name startingwith UD (User Defined). Care should be taken to ensure the name of the attribute is unique.7.1.5 Object Attribute Table7.1.5.1 The object attribute table is used to list all the attributes related to the defined object as shown below theaccess is defined as Read only (RO) or Read/Write (RW). The REQD column is used to specify whether theattribute is required for implementation. Finally, the Form column is used to specify the format of that particularattribute.Table 1 Object Attribute Table Attribute Name Definition Access Reqd FormObjType Object type RO Y Text = Carrier 7.2 State Model Methodology7.2.1 A state model has three elements: definitions of each state and sub-state, a diagram of the states and thetransitions between states, and a state transition table. The diagram of the state model uses the Harel State Chartnotation. An overview of this notation is presented in an Appendix of SEMI E30. The definition of this notation ispresented in Science of Computer Programming 8, Statecharts: A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems, by D.Harel, 1987. 1 7.2.2 State Model Requirements7.2.2.1 The state models included in this standard are a requirement for RPMS compliance. A state model consistsof a state model diagram, state definitions, and a state transition table. All state transitions in this standard, unlessotherwise specified, shall correspond to collection events.7.2.2.2 A state model represents the hosts view of the equipment, and does not necessarily describe the internalequipment operation. All Reticle and Pod Management state model transitions shall be mapped sequentially into theappropriate internal equipment collection events that satisfy the requirements of those transitions. In certainimplementations, the equipment may enter a state and have already satisfied all of the conditions required by theRPMS state model for transition to another state. In this case, the equipment makes the required transition withoutany additional actions in this situation.7.2.2.3 Some equipment may need to include additional sub-states other than those in this standard. Additional sub-states may be added, but shall not change the Reticle and Pod Management defined state transitions. All expectedtransitions between Reticle and Pod Management states shall occur.7.2.2.4 Transition tables are provided in conjunction with the state diagrams to explicitly describe the nature of eachstate transition. A transition table contains columns for Transition number, Previous State, Trigger, New State,Actions, and Comments. The trigger (column 3) for the transition occurs while in the previous state. Theactions (column 5) includes a combination of: Actions taken upon exit of the previous state, Actions taken upon entry of the new state, and Actions taken which are most closely associated with the transition.Table 2 State Transition Table Num Previous State Trigger New State Actions Comments 1 Elsevier Science, P.

A servicemessage may be either a request message, which always requires a response, or a notification message that does notrequire a response.7.3.2 Service Message Description7.3.2.1 A service message description table defines the parameters used in a service, as shown in the followingtable:Table 3 Service Message Description Table Service Name Type Description #1 Type can be either N = Notification or R = Request & Response. 7.3.2.2 Notification type messages are initiated by the service provider (e.g., the equipment) and the provider doesnot expect to get a response from the service user. Request messages are initiated by a service user (e.g., the host).Request messages ask for data or an activity from the provider. Request messages expect a specific responsemessage (no presumption on the message content).7.3.3 Service Message Parameter Definition7.3.3.1 A service parameter dictionary table defines the description, range, and type for parameters used byservices, as shown in the following table:Table 4 Service Message Parameter Definition Table Parameter Name Form Description #1 A row is provided in the table for each parameter used on a service. 7.3.4 Service Message Definition7.3.4.1 A service message description table defines the parameters used in a service message. It also describes eachmessage and its cause/effect to the equipment. The columns labeled Req/Ind and Resp/Conf link the parameters tothe direction of the message. Service Parameter Req/Ind Resp/Conf Description 7.3.4.2 The columns labeled Req/Ind and Rsp/Conf link the parameters to the direction of the message. Themessage sent by the initiator is called the Request. The receiver terms this message the Indication. The receivermay then send a Response, which the original sender terms the Confirmation.7.3.4.3 The following codes appear in the Req/Ind and Rsp/Conf columns and are used in the definition of theparameters (e.g., how each parameter is used in each direction):M Mandatory Parameter  must be given a valid value.C Conditional Parameter  may be defined in some circumstances and undefined in others. Whether a value is given maybe completely optional or may depend on the values of other parameters.U User-Defined Parameter.- The parameter is not used.= (for response only) Indicates that the value of this parameter in the response must match that in the primary (ifdefined).

SEMI E109-0305 © SEMI 2001, 20057 7.4 Alarm Requirements Definition7.4.1 An alarm requirements definition table defines the specific set of alarms required by RPMS. The table isdivided up by equipment configuration, and then by alarm. The danger and affected columns are marked with Xcharacters to show each alarm and its possible impact to operators, equipment, and material. The table format isshown in the following example: Equipment Danger Affected Configuration Alarm Text Potential Imminent Operator Equipment MaterialConfiguration 1 Alarm 1 X X X XAlarm 2 X XConfiguration 2 Alarm 3 X X XAlarm 4 X X X 8 Overview8.1 The Reticle and Pod Management standard defines the behavior, data, and services required for equipmentsupporting automated reticle pod transfer, reticle pod management, and reticle management. This documentprovides a standard interface for host/equipment communications regarding the transfer of reticle pods, reticle podidentification and verification, transfer of reticles to and from equipment, reticle identification and verification,reticle inspection and qualification, and tracking of reticles. The standardized reticle pod transfer host interfaceinclude transfers to and from the external reticle load ports and internal reticle pod locations, the standardized reticlehost interface include transfers to and from the reticle pod, transfers to and from the internal reticle library positions,and reticle identification, inspection, verification, qualification and tracking of reticles.8.2 Single Connection Requirement8.2.1 The expectation of the production and storage equipment supplier is that this standard be implemented in con-junction with the GEM interface to their production equipment and without the use of a separate communicationconnection. 9 Load Port9.1 A reticle pod load port (port) is used by the factory to load and unload reticle pods to and from Lithography,reticle inspection, and bare reticle storage equipment. A reticle pod load port may be used as a reticle pod input loadport, a reticle pod output load port, or as a reticle pod input/output load port, depending upon equipment type,configuration and/or factory practices. This classification may be fixed or it may be programmable by the user. Areticle pod load port is generally designed to handle one specific carrier type, reticle SMIF pods (RSP).9.1.1 The equipment supplier is free to implement Load Ports as objects, but this is not a requirement forcompliance to this standard.9.2 Load Port Numbering9.2.1 The reticle pod load port number shall be assigned incrementally from the bottom left to bottom right, thentop left to top right when facing the reticle load ports. The numbering system should start with 101 to differentiatefrom FOUP load ports. The reticle pod load port-numbering requirement is to provide a common reference base toexternal entities, such as humans.9.3 Reticle Pod Slot Numbering9.3.1 The slot numbers for a reticle pod shall be assigned incrementally from the bottom, starting with 1.9.4 Reticle Pod Load Port Resource Sharing9.4.1 A model of a reticle pod load port must account for any mechanical assemblies that are either active duringreticle pod transfer or are capable of interacting with the transfer. The reticle pod load port is responsible for suchmechanisms when the reticle pod load port is in the TRANSFER READY state. If these mechanisms are sharedwith other reticle pod load ports, then the sharing must be coordinated.

SEMI E109-0305 © SEMI 2001, 2005 8 9.5 Reticle Pod Load Port Transfer State Model9.5.1 The purpose of the Reticle Pod Load Port Transfer State Model is to define the host view of a reticle podtransfer, which includes the host interactions with the equipment necessary to transfer reticle pods to and fromequipment reticle pod load ports. Each reticle pod load port on the equipment shall maintain an independentinstance of this state model.9.5.2 Reticle Pod Load Port Transfer State Model Diagram9.5.2.1 Figure 1 is the diagram for the Reticle Pod Load Port Transfer State Model.9.5.3 Reticle Pod Load Port Transfer State Definitions9.5.3.1 RETICLE POD LOAD PORT TRANSFER  The super state for the IN SERVICE and OUT OF SERVICEstates.9.5.3.2 OUT OF SERVICE  Transfer to/from this reticle pod load port is disabled. A transition to IN SERVICEis required to continue using this reticle pod load port for transfers.9.5.3.3 IN SERVICE  Transfer to/from this reticle pod load port is enabled. A transition to OUT OF SERVICEdisables the reticle pod load port for transfer use.9.5.3.4 TRANSFER READY  A sub-state of IN SERVICE. The reticle pod load port is available for pod transfer.The transfer can either be manual or automated, and can be a load or an unload. This state contains two sub-states,which are used depending on whether or not a reticle pod is present on the load port (READY TO LOAD andREADY TO UNLOAD).9.5.3.5 READY TO LOAD  A sub-state of TRANSFER READY. When transitioning to the TRANSFERREADY state, if a reticle pod is not present on the specified reticle pod load port, this is the active sub-state. In thisstate, the reticle pod load port is available to be loaded with an external reticle pod.9.5.3.6 READY TO UNLOAD  A sub-state of TRANSFER READY. When transitioning to the TRANSFERREADY state, if a reticle pod is present on the specified reticle pod load port, this is the active sub-state. In thisstate, the reticle pod load port is available for unloading of a reticle pod from the reticle pod load port to materialhandling equipment. When the reticle pod load port is being used by the equipment, the state shall transition toTRANSFER BLOCKED.9.5.3.7 TRANSFER BLOCKED  The reticle pod transfer state is neither READY TO LOAD nor READY TOUNLOAD. Because of reticle pod load port related activity being performed, transfer is not available to/from thisreticle pod load port at this time.

TRANSFERREADYThe sub-state of TRANSFER READY,which is decided by transition #5.Data required to be available for thisevent report:PortID 10 Reticle Pod Object10.1 Information about a reticle pod is encapsulated as an object. This allows the host to exchange informationwith the equipment about one or more specific reticle pods using services defined in SEMI E39, Object ServicesStandard. A reticle pod has properties (attributes) that are defined in Table 6, Pod Attribute Definition.10.2 Object Instantiation10.2.1 The reticle pod object is a software representation of the reticle pod in the equipment. Under normalcircumstances this object is instantiated by the equipment when the host uses the Bind, ReticleTransferJob, orPodNotification service or when the equipment successfully reads the PodID from the reticle pod. A reticle podobject is instantiated by PodID read only if there are no currently existing objects of the same object type with thePodID just read. A reticle pod object can also be instantiated by either the ProceedWithPod or CancelPod Serviceson an UNASSOCIATED port. (This implies a failed PodID read event.) The ContentMap attribute will be an emptylist (a list of zero) when the instantiation is done by PodID read. The SlotMap attribute should be a list consisting ofall slots enumerated as UNDEFINED when the reticle pod object is instantiated by PodID read.
