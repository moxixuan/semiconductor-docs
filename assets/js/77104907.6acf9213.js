Initially available at ",(0,o.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.semi.orgSeptember"},"www.semi.orgSeptember")," 2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published September 1999; last published July2004.E This standard was editorially modified in September 2004 to correct a formatting error. Changes were madeto Table 6. 1 Purpose1.1 This standard establishes a Specific EquipmentModel (SEM) for AMHS storage equipment (StockerSEM). The model consists of equipment characteristicsand behaviors that are to be implemented in addition tothe SEMI E30 fundamental requirements and selectedadditional capabilities. The intent of this standard is tofacilitate the integration of Stocker SEM equipmentinto an automated (e.g., semiconductor fabrication andflat panel display) factory. This document accomplishesthis by defining an operational model for Stocker SEMequipment as viewed by a factory automation controller(Host). This definition provides a standard hostinterface and equipment operational behavior (e.g.,control, state models, and data reports). Several topicsrequire additional activity that are within the scope ofthis standard: queuing, parallel interface for carriertransfer (SEMI E23), stocker controller architecture,and scheduling and transport of the transfer unit. 2 Scope2.1 The scope of this standard is limited to the usageand description of AMHS storage equipment (Stockers)as perceived by a SEMI Equipment CommunicationsStandard 2 (SECS-II) host that complies with the GEMmodel (as specified in Section 13). It defines the viewof the equipment through the SECS communicationlink. It does not define the internal operation of theequipment. It includes a specific transfer commandstate model and stocker controller state model as thebasis for all equipment of this class.2.2 This document assumes that the GEM fundamentalrequirements and selected additional capabilities (asspecified in Section 13) have been implemented on theStocker SEM equipment. It expands the GEM standardrequirements and capabilities in the areas of statemodels (stocker controller, transfer command, carrierand stocker crane state models), collection events,alarm documentation, remote commands, data itemvariables, and material movement.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 SEMI Standards Alignment3.1.1 The GEM (SEMI E30) model was used as thebasis for Stocker SEM requirements definition inalignment with existing AMHS SEM Specifications.3.2 AMHS Storage Equipment Description3.2.1 This standard is targeted at the differenttypes/configurations of 300 mm AMHS storageequipment. The term Stocker SEM equipment refers toall the types of AMHS storage equipment. Theequipment types may have fundamental mechanicaldifferences.3.2.2 Stocker (configuration)3.2.2.1 A Stocker is generally an AMHS automatedstorage and retrieval device used to provide temporarystorage of carriers. The device is not required toprovide temporary storage of carriers (for example,when used as a device to connect multiple IBSEMdevices or as a floor to floor lifter). Additionally, anynumber of physical interfaces may exist to connect thestocker with external devices such as: Interbay and/orIntrabay Transport Systems, Process Equipment, otherStockerSEM devices, Operator ports, etc. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E4  SEMI Equipment CommunicationsStandard 1 Message Transfer (SECS-I)SEMI E5  SEMI Equipment CommunicationsStandard 2 Message Content (SECS-II)SEMI E23  Specification for Cassette TransferParallel I/O InterfaceSEMI E30  Generic Model for Communications andControl of Manufacturing Equipment (GEM)"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 5 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E88-1104E \xa9 SEMI 1999, 2004 2 SEMI E37  High-Speed SECS Message Services(HSMS) Generic ServicesSEMI E37.1  High-Speed SECS Message ServicesSingle Selected-Session Mode (HSMS-SS)SEMI E84  Specification for Enhanced CarrierHandoff Parallel I/O Interface4.2 Other ReferencesHarel, D., Statecharts: A Visual Formalism forComplex Systems, Science of Computer Programming8 (1987) 231-274.1 NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms5.1.1 AMHS  Automated Material Handling System5.1.2 BP  Buffer Port5.1.3 FOUP  Front Opening Unified Pod5.1.4 GEM  Generic Equipment Model5.1.5 IBSEM  InterBay/IntraBay Specific EquipmentModel5.1.6 ITS  Interbay or Intrabay Transport System5.1.7 LP  Loading Port5.1.8 OP  Output Port5.1.9 PGV  Person Guided Vehicle5.1.10 SC  Stocker Controller5.1.11 TCP/IP  Transmission ControlProtocol/Internet Protocol5.1.12 TSC  Transport System Controller5.2 Definitions5.2.1 Automated Material Handling System  anautomated system to store and transport materialswithin the factory.5.2.2 automation  the capability of managingmaterial and data within the factory.5.2.3 bidirectional load port  a load port used forloading and unloading carriers.5.2.4 buffer  a set of one or more locations forholding carriers at the production equipment.5.2.5 buffer port  special buffer port location on astocker output shuttle.

It is the responsibility of the Host toensure that sufficient capacity exists in the destinationstocker when delivering from a source stocker to adestination stocker (i.e., an interbay move). Forexample, it would be the responsibility of the Host tocheck the remaining capacity of the destination stockerprior to issuing the transfer command to send the carrierto the interbay output port of the source stocker.6.1.3 Output to the Intrabay Output Port6.1.3.1 The destination for a transfer command tomove a carrier to an intrabay output port must be aloading port.6.1.4 Store to the Stocker Shelf6.1.4.1 The specific stocker shelf location is to becontrolled by the Stocker Controller (SC). The Hostdoes not specify a shelf ID in a transfer command. TheHost sends the name of a zone as the destination in thetransfer command6.1.4.2 The carrier is stored to a stocker shelftemporarily when the Host requested output portdestination is occupied. This is the responsibility of theStocker Controller. The carrier count of the stocker isincremented due to this temporary storage (i.e., thecurrent capacity decreases).6.1.4.3 For multi-crane stockers, the carrier istemporarily stored to a stocker shelf when the sourceand destination is not accessible by the same stockercrane. This is the responsibility of the StockerController. The carrier count of the zone containing thelocation where the carrier is temporarily stored isincremented due to this temporary storage (i.e. thecurrent capacity decreases).6.2 Quantity Control in the Stocker (CapacityPlanning)6.2.1 The number of carriers in the stocker iscontrolled by the Host. A list of carrier database entriesin the specified stockers SC database will be availableto the Host upon request via a remote command.6.3 Number of Stocker Cranes6.3.1 No Limitation. May be zero for systems that donot include a crane. Host does not control the stockercrane directly. 6.4 Port Type6.4.1 The independent input port and the independentoutput port are required for the Stocker SEM. Theswapping type is considered as an independent port.6.5 Plural Sets of Input/Output Ports6.5.1 Plural sets of Input/Output ports connected to theinterbay or intrabay transport system must beconsidered. (This would be considered a Multi-looptype interface connection to the stocker.) Examples ofplural sets of interfaces are as follows: Main Loop/Sub Loop, Right-handed rotation/Left-handed rotation, and Double Track (i.e., Stacked Track).6.6 Carrier ID Reader Manual Input Port: Carrier ID Reader ismandatory. Automated Input Port: Carrier ID Reader is acustomer option.

In addition, Stocker SEM compliant equipment shall support either SEMI E37 and SEMI E37.1 or SEMI E4. 8 State Models8.1 State Model Requirements8.1.1 The state models included in this standard are a requirement for Stocker SEM equipment. This standardrequires implementation of all SEMI E30 state models (such as control, communication, on-line/off-line, etc.according to the GEM capabilities required per Section 13). A state model consists of a state model diagram, statedefinitions, and a state transition table. All state transitions in this standard, unless otherwise specified, shallcorrespond to collection events.8.1.2 A state model is the hosts view of the equipment, and does not necessarily describe the internal equipmentoperation. All Stocker SEM state model transitions shall be mapped into the appropriate internal equipment eventsthat satisfy the requirements of those transitions. In certain implementations, the equipment may enter a state andhave already satisfied all of the conditions required by the Stocker SEM state model for transition to another state.The equipment makes the required transition without any additional actions in this situation.8.1.3 Some equipment may need to include additional substates other than those in this standard. Additionalsubstates may be added, but shall not change the Stocker SEM defined state transitions. All expected transitionsbetween Stocker SEM states shall occur.8.2 SC State Model8.2.1 SC State Model Requirements8.2.1.1 The purpose of the SC state model is to provide information to the host regarding the overall status of thestocker system. The SC state model is valid when the SEMI E30 (GEM) state is ON-LINE. The SC state model isnot valid when the SEMI E30 (GEM) state is OFF-LINE. Since a stocker may consist of many components (e.g.,"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 9 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E88-1104E \xa9 SEMI 1999, 2004 6 stocker crane, conveyor, ID reader, etc.), it may be possible to continue ON-LINE operation when the operationmode of some stocker components (as viewed by the SC) is a manual state. The details of what happens whenindividual components of the stocker enter a manual state are specific to the Stocker SEM equipment supplier.When the SEMI E30 Control state changes from OFF-LINE to ON-LINE, the SC State Model is started from the SCINIT state.8.2.2 SC State Model PAUSED PAUSING AUTO ALARMS NO ALARMS SC INIT 6 3 4 8 7 AVAILABILITYSYSTEM 5 2 1 9 C Figure 3Generic Stocker SEM SC State Model Diagram 8.2.3 SC State Definitions8.2.3.1 SC INIT  SC initialization of stocker components is occurring.

If it is possible for the stocker tocontinue operation while the stocker crane is not operational then the Stocker Crane State Model will retain itscurrent state and the SC State Model will be ALARM. When the stocker crane becomes operational again, the stateof the Stocker Crane State Model will transition to the new state. Whether it is possible to continue operation whilethe stocker crane is not operational is specific to the stocker SEM equipment supplier. If a single stocker containsmultiple stocker cranes, each stocker crane must comply with the stocker crane state model. Compliance with thestocker crane state model is only required for devices that contain a crane. The Host should not be dependent on anyevents from the stocker crane state model.8.5.2 Stocker Crane State Model ACTIVEIDLE1 2Figure 6Generic Stocker SEM Stocker Crane State Model Diagram 8.5.3 Stocker Crane State Definitions8.5.3.1 IDLE  The stocker crane is not performing Host or SC initiated work.8.5.3.2 ACTIVE  The stocker crane is busy performing Host or SC initiated work."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 16 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E88-1104E \xa9 SEMI 1999, 200413 8.5.4 Stocker Crane State Transition TableTable 4 Stocker Crane State Transition TableTransition # Previous State Trigger New State Actions Comments1 IDLE Crane is requested to performhost or SC initiated work.ACTIVE S6F11CraneActive2 ACTIVE Crane completes host or SCinitiated work.IDLE S6F11CraneIdle 8.6 Port Transfer State Model8.6.1 Port Transfer State Model Requirements8.6.1.1 The purpose of the port state model is to provided information to the host for the use in accessing ports.This may permit the host and stocker to utilize ports that are in service while avoiding the use of ports that are not inservice.8.6.2 Port Transfer State Model IN SERVICE C READY TOLOAD READY TOUNLOAD TRANSFERBLOCKED 5 67 8 4 C1 OUT OFSERVICE 2 3 Figure 7Port State Model DiagramA-1.1.1.1"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 17 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E88-1104E \xa9 SEMI 1999, 2004 14 8.6.3 Port Transfer State Definitions8.6.3.1 OUT OF SERVICE  Transfer to/from this port is disabled and the port should not be used in any Transfercommand issued by the host.

This includes situations where the Alarm may not be directly related to the port.For example, the alarm may be associated with the crane and since the crane cannot function, the port cannot beserviced normally. If any port on a multi-position conveyor with a single LP position is Out Of Service, then allports on the conveyor shall be Out Of Service. If a command is issued by the host which uses this port, it will notbe rejected simply because the port is in this state.8.6.3.2 IN SERVICE  Transfer to/from this port is enabled.8.6.3.3 The following are optional sub-states of the IN SERVICE state to provide information to the host for theuse in accessing ports.

Some SVs in the Variable Data Item Dictionary are referenced by an i subscript (e.g., CarrierID i). The isubscript denotes a specific instance of the SV. This is necessary since there is usually more than one instanceof such an SV active in the system at the same time (e.g., if there are 20 carriers active at the same time then icould range from 1 to 20 for CarrierIDi). Variable Data Items containing the i subscript should not haveVariable IDs assigned to them. All variable data items with a format of ASCII (A) shall be limited to printable characters in the decimal rangeof 32 to 126, with the exception of the following non-permitted characters: ","*"," (decimal 42), ","\\","(decimal 92).10.2.1 Variable data items are documented in the Stocker SEM Variable Data Item Dictionary using the followingformat: Variable Name Type Description Class Format Comments Where:Variable Name: A unique name for the variable data item.Type: CV  meaning common variables, variables that are general to all vehicles.CSV  meaning configuration specific variables.Description: If class is DVVAL, then the description shall contain a statement of when data is valid interms of Stocker SEM events.Class: The data type of the item.Format: acceptable formats are SEMI E5 lists, ASCII,floating point, unsigned integer or signed integer.

Instead, the Stocker SEM is requiring the two tables provided as described inSEMI E30 (Section 8.4). Alarm List Table which is intended to provide for equipment configuration specific alarmsand Alarm ID, Alarm Set/Cleared Event Table. Any alarm that is displayed locally at the equipment, if enabled, isrequired to be sent to the host. To be compliant, Tables 9 and 10 must be completed by the supplier, documentingall alarms.11.2 Alarm List Table11.2.1 The alarm list table contains examples of alarms that pertain to various configuration aspects of equipment.These examples are intended to illustrate that alarms pertain to situations in which there exists a potential forexceeding physical safety limits associated with people, equipment, and material being transported as per the SEMIE30 definition of an alarm. See SEMI E30 for further reference. The supplier is responsible for supplyingdocumentation associated with these alarm definitions. Each alarm will have an associated alarm text (ALTX) andalarm identifier (ALID). Table 9 contains an example of alarm list information that is intended to be augmentedwhen the Stocker SEM equipment supplier documents their interface. Examples highlighted by (","*",") are required byStocker SEM.Table 9 Alarm List TableDanger AffectedEquipment Cfg.

Requirements The equipment shall support the SEMI E30(according to the GEM capabilities required perSection 13) required remote commands. All the remote commands defined by Stocker SEMare required to be implemented as specified. The alphanumeric strings defined by Stocker SEMfor RCMD and CPNAME are required. A completed table must be generated where an Xis placed in the table for each state that a givencommand is valid. If additional remote commands are supported thena remote commands versus valid states matrixmust be generated for these additional commands. For additional commands, a table must begenerated similar to the remote commanddescriptions summary.12.3 Remote Commands Description12.3.1 ABORT  This command terminates theactivity of a specific TRANSFER command based onCommandID while the command is in the ACTIVEstate. This command might not be accepted due tomechanical issues if the stocker is in a specific con-dition (e.g., moving a carrier). The exact conditionssurrounding when the ABORT command is not ac-cepted by the SC must be documented by the StockerSEM equipment supplier. If accepted, this commandshall clear any error condition that was generated by theTRANSFER command being aborted. For example, ifa DestOccupied or SourceEmpty error had occurred,the error shall be cleared.12.3.2 CANCEL  This command terminates theactivity of a specific TRANSFER command based onCommandID while the command is in the QUEUEDstate. This command must always be accepted by theSC when in the QUEUED state. 12.3.3 INSTALL  This is used to update the SCdatabase by adding a specified CarrierID record to aspecified CarrierLoc. If the CarrierID specified by theHost is already in the SC database then the additionalfields will be updated based on the informationcontained in this command.12.3.4 LOCATE  This command is used by the Hostto query the SC for database carrier information.12.3.5 PAUSE  This command puts the SC in thePAUSING state.12.3.6 REMOVE  This is used to update the SCdatabase by deleting a specified carrier. This commandwould be used for database recovery.12.3.7 RESUME  This command puts the SC in theAUTO state.12.3.8 RETRY (Supplier Option)  This commandmay be used by the Host when an error is encounteredby the stocker. The Host would use this command toallow the stocker to retry the movement which gener-ated the error condition. This command shall clear theerror condition that is being addressed by the command.12.3.9 TRANSFER  This is a SECS-II EnhancedRemote Command instead of a SECS-II HostCommand Send (S2,F49 instead of S2,F41). See theexamples in Section 15.1 for details.12.3.10 This command is used to perform the entiretransfer command for the carrier to be transferredbetween stocker locations. The execution of this com-mand will include allocation of resources, acquiring thecarrier, moving the carrier to the destination, queuingthe carrier at an alternate destination (if needed),depositing the carrier, and returning the resources forother use. The number of carriers in the TRANSFERcommand is always equal to one (i.e., the size of thetransfer unit is always equal to one carrier).12.3.11 INFOUPDATE  This is used to associateinformation with a carrier while in the SC database.This command is an optional feature and is not requiredfor compliance. If this command is not supported, thena HCACK of 1 (Command does not exist ) shall bereturned. If the carrier does not exist in the SCdatabase, then a HCACK of 3 (At least one parameteris invalid) shall be returned."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 30 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E88-1104E \xa9 SEMI 1999, 200427 12.3.12 Remote Commands and Associated Host Command Parameters12.3.12.1 This table describes the allowable command parameters (CPNAME) for each remote command(RCMD).

The port shuttle also has a BP (location 04) that is the location reached by a carrier beforereaching the LP positions. The Host sends the three Transfer commands to the stocker and they are queued. Thefirst two Transfer commands send carriers to LP locations 05 and 06 respectively. These carriers are to be loaded bythe same AGV. The third carrier is also requested to LP 05. Each carrier is transferred to the OP where it thenautomatically travels forward on the shuttle toward the BP and LPs (see figure in Section 6.16). The first twocarriers arrive at the LPs. The vehicle removes the two carriers from the LPs. The third carrier then shuttlesforward to the LP location 05. STEP COMMENTS HOST SC COMMENTS1.
