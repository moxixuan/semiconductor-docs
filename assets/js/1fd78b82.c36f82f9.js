It  should  be  noted\nhowever, that unlike silane, DCS is not expected to autoignite\nin  almost  all  ambient  conditions  where  we  would  find  it  in\nuse.  For  fire  protection  purposes  it  can  be  treated  as  a  highly\nflammable gas.\n6. 2  Risk    Management    Strategies \uf8e7    Fundamental\nconcepts of safety and accident prevention are:\n6. 2.1        An    understanding    of    facilities,    piping    and\nequipment,  from  storage  to  gas  abatement,  is  essential\nfor    safe    handling    of    silane    family    gases    in\nsemiconductor or FPD manufacturing facilities.\n6. 2.2      The   safety   of   facilities   can   be   enhanced   by\nimplementation   of   designs   for   sources,   piping   and\nequipment  that  use  devices  with  fail-safe,  foolproof,\nself-diagnostic and predictive functions.\n6. 2.3  Safety systems should detect current safety status\nand generate notices that indicate conditions of elevated\nrisk,  through  computer  self-diagnosis  and  dedicated\nSSCS  devices.    If  the  SSCSs  cannot  confirm  normal\noperation of assigned silane family gas handling system\nor    unit,    the    silane    family    gas    supply    should\nautomatically be shut off.\n6. 2.3.1    SSCSs    can  determine  if  a  safe  status  has  been\nachieved  before  proceeding  to  the  next  step  in  a  silane\nfamily gas handling process.\n6. 2.3.2      SSCSs   should   be   provided   in   distribution\nfacilities,   cylinder   cabinets,   process   equipment,   gas\ntreatment systems, and the like.\n6. 2.4  Safe design depends on equipment designers\xed and\nfacilities  designers\xed  understanding  of  silane  family  gas\nproperties and hazards.

The\nisolation  should  also  be  applied  to  silane  family  gas\npurge lines.\n15. 2.2  Coaxial Piping\nNOTE 47:  Some  jurisdictions  require  building-runs  of  silane\nfamily  gas  piping  to  be  of  secondarily  contained  (coaxial)\nconstruction.      Some   believe   there   is   little   evidence   that\ncoaxial  piping  for  these  gases  is  appropriate,  as  long  as  non-\nwelded  fittings  are  within  secondary  enclosures.    Coaxial\npiping  may  add  substantial  costs  and  other  hazards  which\nshould  then  be  addressed.  However,  pressurized,  monitored,\nand interlocked coax lines provide a local warning to persons\nwho   accidentally   damage   the   jacket.   The   sound   of   the\nescaping  inert  gas  used  to  pressurize  the  jacket  alerts  the\nworker.  The  interlock  alerts  the  facility  of  the  breach,  and\nreduces the total amount of process gas lost if the inner line is\ndamaged.\n15. 2.2.1    When  coaxial  piping  is  installed,  the  annular\nspace  should  be  pressurized  with  helium  or  other  inert\ngas, purged, or maintained at a vacuum.\n15. 2.2.2    If  a  purge  method  is  used,  the  purge  gases\nfrom   the   coaxial   piping   should   be   monitored   with\ndetectors for the specific silane family gas.\n15. 2.2.2.1    This  detector  should  shut  down  the  source\nwhen a leak is detected.\n15. 2.2.3        If  a  pressure  or  vacuum  method  is  used,  the\npressure  or  vacuum  in  this  annular  space  should  be"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S18-1102 \xa9 SEMI 2002"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"13\nmonitored  and  should  alarm  at  a  constantly  attended\nlocation when a change occurs.\n15. 2.2.3.1    The  alarm  should  also  shut  off  the  silane\nfamily gas at the nearest up-stream valve.\n15. 2.2.4    A  procedure  for  responding  to  an  annular\nspace  alarm,  and  determining  the  nature  of  the  hazard\ncondition, should be created.\n15. 3  Flow Components\n15. 3.1    The  state  of  a  valve  (open  or  closed)  should  be\nindicated  through  display  or  on  the  valve  itself.

minimum  number  of  cycles\nshould  be  controlled  in  such  a  way  that  the  user  is\naware of the consequences of changing the cycle count,\nand access to the means of changing the cycle count is\nlimited  to  maintenance  or  service  personnel,  but  not\noperators.\n16. 1.5    When    the  appropriate  number  of  purge  cycles\nfor  the  user\xeds  own  process  are  determined  by  the  user,\nthe  number  should  not  be  less  than  the  minimum\nnumber   of   cycles   recommended   by   the   equipment\nsupplier.\n16. 1.5.1  If  unusual  circumstances  appear  to  reduce  the\nnumber   of   cycles   needed,   the   supplier   should   be\nconsulted   for   a   recommendation   specific   to   the\ncircumstances.\n16. 1.6  If a system is designed to supply a silane

One  example  of  such  a  differentiation  marking  is\nshown in Related Information 3.\n7. 2    All  LOTO  EIDs  integral  to  the  equipment  should\nbe marked on the equipment.\n7. 2.1    LOTO  EID  markings  should  be  located  on  the\nequipment adjacent to (not on) the EIDs they identify.\nNOTE   12:   Marking   directly   on   the   EID   can   mean   that\nreplacement of the EID will also remove the EID marking.\n7. 2.2      Where   the   LOTO   EID   marking   is   obscured\n(covered by wiring, tubing, installation hardware, etc.),\nan additional marking should also be placed on the EID\nitself.\n7. 3      For   LOTO   EIDs   required   by   the   supplier   but\nprovided  and  installed  by  the  user,  the  supplier  should\nspecify the requirements for such devices.\n7. 3.1    When  such  devices  are  specified,  users  should\nprovide lockable EIDs.\n7. 3.2  Users should provide to the supplier, if requested,\nthe location of the device.\n7. 3.3  Utility  connection  points  for  which  LOTO  EIDs\nare located external to the equipment should be marked\nto  indicate  that  a  user-provided  EID  is  the  method  of\nenergy  isolation.    Space  on  the  equipment  should  be\nprovided  for  the  user  to  indicate  the  location  of  the\nLOTO EID.\n7. 4  The style and size of letters and numbers on LOTO\nEID  markings  should  meet  the  criteria  of  SEMI  S8  in\norder  to  be  readable  from  the  normal  viewpoint  of\naccess to the LOTO EID.\n7. 4.1    The  LOTO  EID  marking  (as  it  appears  on  the\nequipment) need not be colored according to Table 1 in\nSection 9."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S20-0303 \xa9 SEMI 2003 4\n8  Graphical Representations in Manuals,\nDocumentation & Procedures\n8. 1  Supplier-provided   instructions  for  lockout/tagout\nand graphical representations of LOTO EIDs should be\nincluded  with  each  maintenance  task  or  in  a  separate\nsection  of  the  manual  referenced  by  each  maintenance\ntask to which they pertain.\n8. 2  The text instructions should refer to the equipment\nand all support equipment related to the task.\n8. 2.1    When  the  supplier  does  not  provide  the  support\nequipment,  a  generic  graphical-reference  placeholder\nfor  the  equipment  should  be  used.

LOTO EIDs should be\ngraphically    identified    on    these    reference    guides.\nInstructions  for  controlling  each  source  of  energy  as\noutlined in Section 6.1.2 should also be provided on the\nreference  guides.    The  reference  guides  should  be  task\nspecific.\nNOTE 16: See Related Information 1 for example.\nEXCEPTION:  A  single  graphical  reference  guide  may\nbe  used  for  more  than  one  task,  provided  it  can  be\neasily  determined  from  the  text  instructions,  which\nLOTO EIDs are used for each task.\n9. 2    It  is  recommended  that  the  graphical  reference\nguides  include  a  color  representation  of  the  overall\nequipment,    as    well    as    individual    task-specific\nrepresentations,   as   they   would   be   found   in   the\nmaintenance manual.\nEXCEPTION:  If manuals are printed only in black and\nwhite,  the  color  representation  may  be  specified  as\n\u201cprinted by the user\u201d from the electronic copy.\n9. 3    If  the  supplier  has  no  standard  for  coloring  the\nindicators  of  the  LOTO  EID  locations  on  graphical\nrepresentations, they should be colored according to the\ntype    of    energy    being    isolated.
