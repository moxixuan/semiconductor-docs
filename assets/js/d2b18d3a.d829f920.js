R1-1R1-1.1 To understand the production metrics given inSection 6, we need to understand the underlying sciencebehind factory dynamics.

Littles law relatesthe three most significant fundamental quantities ofproduction systems. Unfortunately, it says that all threemetrics cannot be optimized simultaneously. Littles law is shown graphically in Figure R1-1. In all of thefigures in this Related Information, the colors denotedifferent values of the normalized production efficiencymetric with green representing values close to one (atthe bottleneck throughput rate and theoretical cycletime), yellow representing values close to \u03a9 (thethreshold case as discussed in Section R1-1.7), and redrepresenting values close to zero (when the throughputrate goes to zero or the cycle time gets large). On thefloor of Figure R1-1 are the linear contours of the cycletime level sets. Note that the boundaries of theoperating region are determined by the theoretical cycletime (Tmin), the bottleneck throughput rate (Rmax), andthe WIP capacity (Wmax).

R3-1R3-1.1 As was mentioned in Section 2.1, there are atleast three things in need of measurement in a factory:production, utilization of assets, and costs. This guidefocuses on evaluating production; utilization of assetsand costs (as well as other economic factors) areoutside its scope. For measuring effectiveness of assetuse, an average (over all of the equipment in thefactory) of overall equipment efficiency (OEE)weighted by cost of ownership (COO) can be defined inone of those documents. However, the use ofconsumables, utilities, and human resources would stillneed to be comprehended. For measuring costs, someother new standard might define a new metric (likeCOO) for the cost of factory ownership in such terms as$/(good wafers), $/(good chips), $/(metal levels),$/(good transistors), $/circuit, or $/bit.R3-1.2 As was mentioned in Section 3.2, the metrics inthis guide are intended for evaluating the overall healthof the factory production, not for diagnosing problems(or opportunities for improvement) in the factory,although some component metrics can be used thatway. These metrics should indicate whether the factoryis running poorly (like taking a persons temperaturetells whether they are sick) while some of itscomponents and other diagnostic metrics might indicatewhat the cause of the problem is (like doing a bloodanalysis in the lab identifies the disease). Thefollowing are examples of metrics not in this guide thatcan be used for diagnosis: ratio of turns to work in process (WIP) at keyoperations or for blocks of operations. overall WIP distribution. daily starts and output. defect density. throughput, utilization, and available up-time ofbottleneck equipment.

It is aguide for establishing electrostatic compatibility infacilities used for semiconductor manufacturing.1.2 Electrostatic surface charge causes a number ofundesirable effects in semiconductor manufacturingenvironments. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) damagesboth products and reticles. ESD events also causeelectromagnetic interference (EMI), resulting inequipment malfunctions. Charged wafer and reticlesurfaces attract particles (electrostatic attraction orESA) and increase the defect rate. Charge on productscan also result in equipment malfunction or productbreakage. Operating problems and additional productdefects due to static charge can have a negative impacton the cost of ownership of semiconductormanufacturing equipment (refer to SEMI E35).1.3 For product and reticle protection or EMI control,the measurement of the ESD risk of an area is definedby the presence and nature of the ESD events thatoccur. For contamination control by reducing particleattraction, the static risk of an area is defined by thepresence and level of static charges.1.4 While an increasing amount of semiconductorproduction is done in minienvironments or within theproduction equipment, product and reticles must still betransported throughout the manufacturing facility.They are both affected by, and the cause of staticproblems during transport. Moving personnel in themanufacturing facility are also sources of static chargeproblems. This document addresses the presence ofstatic charge in the entire facility, including theproduction equipment and minienvironments.1.5 Static control methods can be incorporated in thefactory design to reduce static charge to acceptablelevels. This guide is intended for use primarily bysemiconductor manufacturers and cleanroom facilitiesdesigners during the design of their facilities.Producers of the silicon wafers and photomasks used insemiconductor manufacturing will also find it useful.There are test methods available (see Section 7 and Related Information 2 of this guide) to demonstrate theeffectiveness of the static control methods. The enduser will be able to use the same test methods to verifycompliance with a facility design specification after thefacility is built or after design changes have been made,and to verify ongoing compliance as a part of factorymaintenance procedures.1.6 Semiconductor process technology will continue tomove toward smaller product geometries. Acceptablestatic charge levels will decrease with product featuresize. This document will help to assure that facilitystatic charge limits are appropriate for the product beingmanufactured. 2 Scope2.1 The scope of this document is limited to methodsof measurement and a guide for the maximumrecommended level of static charge on all facilitysurfaces including: Product, photomasks or their carriers, Facility construction materials and furniture, Personnel, Packaging and transport materials, and Equipment (through reference to SEMI E78)2.2 This document references SEMI E78, SEMI E43and other methods of measuring static charge as well asthe performance parameters of static control methods.2.3 Appendix 1 describes the methodology fordetermining the maximum recommended static chargelevels that are shown in Section 12.5 Table 1.NOTE 1: Related Information 1 discusses device sensitivitymeasurements, which are the first step in settingrecommended static levels in a facility.

Ingeneral, direct measurement of static charge is possiblewith small, moveable objects. Larger objects, and thosefixed in position, will need to be characterized by theelectric field that results from the static charge.3.2 Location  The test methods for static charge andmaximum recommended levels of static charge onfacility surfaces are meant to be applied after thefacility has been built. Testing the performance ofstatic control methods may be done before or afterconstruction. It may be difficult to directly relate theperformance of the static control method to the staticcharge level that results in the completed facility. Priorexperience of the static control supplier will be a sourceof this information.3.3 Test Methods  The test methods referenced inthis document do not guarantee precise measurementsof static charge levels. The maximum static chargelevels recommended in this document have largetolerances. See Section 15.1.3.4 Static Charge Control  There are a variety ofstatic related issues in a semiconductor-manufacturingenvironment. The issues are complex due to the widerange of electrostatic problems, and device orequipment sensitivities to these problems. This guidecontains general recommendations.

The amount of static charge, thedistribution of static charge on an object, and the natureof the static discharge will all interact to determine ifthe charge level is safe. It will be difficult to determinelevels that guarantee static related problems are totallyeliminated. The goals of this guide are to assist the userin identifying static charge levels likely to causeproblems in the semiconductor manufacturing facility,and to direct the user to static control methodsappropriate to mitigate these problems. This guide isintended to provide the user with enough insight todefine test methodologies for measuring static chargeand for evaluating the methods to control it.6.2 ESD Damage  Direct Discharge6.2.1 When considering direct ESD damage to anobject (e.g., product, reticle, or equipment), theimportant parameter is the current accompanying thecharge transfer to or from the object. The charge maybe transferred from facility and furniture surfaces,personnel, equipment parts, carriers, packagingmaterials, or anything else that contacts the object.6.2.2 Established test methods exist for determining thethreshold of damage to a particular object. When testingpackaged devices, ESD simulators of various types areused. Refer to ESD Association standards ESDSTM5.1, ANSI ESD STM5.2, and ANSI ESDSTM5.3.1, JEDEC JESD22-A114 and JESD22-C101,or MIL-STD 883 for further information concerningdevice testing. There are no established standards forESD simulator testing of wafers, reticles, orunpackaged semiconductor devices. ESD damagethresholds for these items may be significantly differentthan for packaged devices.6.2.3 Once the damaging current level for a product isdetermined using an appropriate ESD simulator, the corresponding amount of charge is known from theESD simulator operating parameters.6.2.4 In the manufacturing facility, it is important toknow the charge on any objects that might directlycontact the product. Charge measurement methodsusing a coulombmeter and Faraday Cup are describedin SEMI E78 and SEMI E43 for isolated conductors(including personnel), or small and moveable objects.The measurement methods of SEMI E43 can be used toestablish that the charge levels on these objects willpose a hazard to products or reticles from a direct ESDevent.6.2.5 Electric field measurements on large and fixedobjects, or insulators are less useful in estimatingwhether or not a damaging direct ESD event will occur.On objects that cannot be conveniently measured with acoulombmeter, Electrostatic Fieldmeter measurementscan be useful in estimating the ESD threat, even thoughthe measurement may be less quantitative than thecoulombmeter measurement.6.3 ESD Damage  Induced Charge6.3.1 Charge may be induced on an object that resultsin ESD damage. Part of a product (e.g., epoxypackage) or reticle (e.g., quartz substrate) may becomecharged and induce charge separation to occur onanother part of the product (e.g., lead pins) or reticle(e.g., chrome traces). ESD will occur if the lead pins orchrome traces contact ground. Using a coulombmeteror Faraday Cup and the methods of SEMI E43, the enduser should test product or reticles to determine thelevel of static charge at which ESD damage occurs.6.3.2 Alternatively, either the product or reticles maybe handled in proximity to another charged object. Thefield from this charged object induces charge onproduct or reticles, and ESD can result if the product orreticle contacts ground while in the presence of thefield. Using an electrostatic fieldmeter and the methodsof SEMI E43, the end user should test products andreticles to determine the acceptable levels of electricfield from static charge.6.3.3 It has been shown that a changing electric fieldcauses ESD damage to reticles without ground contactoccurring. A changing electric field can result at thereticle when an object in proximity to the reticleacquires a charge, the reticle or a charged object are inmotion with respect to each other, or groundingconditions change the field between a charged objectand the reticle (for example, due to robot handling).See references in Related Information 2. In areas of themanufacturing facility that produce or handle reticles,electric field from any charged object will need to belimited to levels that do not cause reticle ESD damage.Test methods for electric field are contained in SEMI"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 17 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E129-1103 \xa9 SEMI 20035 E43. There are currently no industry standards fordetermining the electric field sensitivity of reticles, buttest methods do exist.6.3.4 Finally, there is increasing anecdotal evidencethat the presence of static charge on wafer surfaces isbecoming an ESD hazard as gate oxide thicknessesbecome thinner. In the future, there may need to befurther limits on allowable static charge on wafersurfaces to prevent ESD-related gate oxide damageduring front-end semiconductor manufacturing. Furtherresearch is needed in this area.6.4 Particle Attraction6.4.1 Electrostatic attraction (ESA) of particles canoccur due to the electrostatic field created by the chargeon the surface of an object. Refer to SEMI E78 andSEMI E43 for an analysis of this effect and itsmeasurement methods.6.4.2 Particles may be attracted to charged facilitysurfaces, or directly to charged products or reticles.Subsequently, they may be dislodged from facilitysurfaces and transfer to products or reticles. Once onproducts or reticle surfaces they may cause eitherrandom or repeating defects.6.4.3 Electrostatic particle deposition velocity dependsonly on electric field, particle size and particle charge.However, the number of particles deposited on asurface also depends on the particle concentration in thearea and the length of the exposure time during whichparticle deposition occurs. SEMI E78 containsinformation to relate allowable electric field to ambientparticle concentration and exposure time.6.4.4 The measurement methods of SEMI E43 can beused to establish that the electric field from any facilitysurface meets the requirements of this document.6.4.5 Charge is difficult to evaluate on large objects,especially insulators. Electric field measurements onthese objects may be useful in estimating the risk that adamaging direct ESD event might occur. However,electric field measurements on insulators are highlyqualitative and only provide a figure of merit as to thethreat that these charges may represent to the ESD-sensitive device.6.5 Equipment ESD6.5.1 Equipment ESD immunity has been establishedat levels considerably higher than those that result indamage to product and reticles. If facility static chargelimits shown in Table 1, of Section 12.5 are used toprotect product and reticles, they will provide sufficientprotection for the equipment.6.5.2 Equipment ESD immunity is addressed, ingeneral, through a number of international standards including SEMI E78, IEC 61000-4-2, and BSEN50082-2 for European CE compliance.Measurements are made using an ESD simulator, whichis described in these standards. 7 Apparatus7.1 ESD Damage  For measuring the chargegenerated on product, reticles, or carriers, the FaradayCup test method is shown in Figure 1.

For example, at startupthe facility may be processing at 180-nm geometry, butin five years it is anticipated to be at 90 nm. Thefacility may need to be designed for the limitsrecommended for the 90-nm use.12.5.2 The levels in Table 1 assume that themanufacturing facility is processing siliconsemiconductors. Manufacturers of specializedcomponents may need to choose lower levels.Examples are manufacturers of gallium arsenidesemiconductors or magneto-resistive (MR) disk driveread heads, those experiencing significant losses due tocontamination, or those using specialized equipment.12.6 The levels listed in Table 1 have been determinedas the result of an analysis of working conditions, orexperiments done in operating semiconductor facilities.Justifications for these levels are found in Appendix 1.The actual levels to be used for any production areamay be decided by agreement between the user anddesigner/builder of the facility.12.7 Other levels may be appropriate under specificoperating conditions and for specific devices. 13 Calculations13.1 A series of five measurements should be made.The average of the five measurements should notexceed the recommended level.

A1-1 Recommended LevelsA1-1.1 The recommended charge and electrostaticfield levels in this guide are not based on specificprotection thresholds for individual devices or processtools. Rather, their aim is to classify the types of ESDevents or static levels that are likely to be of concern.Facility designers and users should determine the typesof events that are of most concern to their products andprocesses, to apply this guide to their needs.Information on specific device damage thresholds isbest determined on an individual basis. A1-2 Justification of Guide Recommendationsin Section 12.5 Table 1A1-2.1 Recommendations for ESD DamageA1-2.1.1 An analysis of the recommended levels toprotect semiconductor devices is found in Appendix 1of SEMI E78. Related Information 1 of SEMI E78discusses test methods for determining ESD damagethresholds for semiconductor devices. Devices arequalified according to the highest ESD stresses they canwithstand without measurable change in their operatingparameters. This section attempts to develop guiderecommendations for minimizing ESD damage basedon those discussions in SEMI E78.A1-2.1.2 The information contained in SEMI E78 wasdeveloped with respect to semiconductors handled byequipment. It was current when published in 1998.Device damage thresholds continue to decrease asgeometries get smaller, and although the classificationsystems discussed in SEMI E78 have not changed,more devices are falling into the more sensitiveclassifications.A1-2.1.3 It is desirable in this document to avoidconfusion with SEMI E78 sensitivity levels, as well asto synchronize with the major changes in technologymapped in the International Technology Roadmap forSemiconductors (ITRS). Recommendations foracceptable static charge levels are listed in Section 12.5Table 1 and given for the major technology nodes of the2003 ITRS, which relate to the size of the features onthe wafer. A1-2.2 Charge Levels for ESD DamageA1-2.2.1 Related Information 1.1 discusses testmethods for determining ESD damage thresholds forsemiconductor devices. Devices are qualifiedaccording to the highest ESD stresses they canwithstand without measurable change in their operatingparameters. This section attempts to develop guiderecommendations for minimizing ESD damage basedon the discussion in Related Information 1.1.A1-2.2.2 As discussed in Related Information 1.1.3,ESD Simulator testing uses different capacitances foreach model. For Human Body Model (HBM) it is 100pF, for Machine Model (MM) it is 200 pF, and forCharged Device Model (CDM) it depends on thecapacitance of the actual device being tested. In anycase, it is charge (charge = voltage  capacitance) thatdamages the device. It would seem appropriate,therefore, that the guide recommendations in Table 1 inSection 12.5 be stated in units of charge (e.g., nC).A1-2.2.3 Based on industry testing reflected in devicedata sheets, there appears to be a wide range for ESDimmunity in semiconductor devices, and it depends onthe type of ESD simulator used. HBM-type ESDdischarges are due to personnel handling and not likelyto occur within equipment. Charged equipment partscontacting devices (i.e., MM) and charged devicescontacting machine parts (i.e., CDM) are the mostlikely causes of ESD damage to devices in equipment.A1-2.3 Industry Device Damage LevelsA1-2.3.1 The recommended electrostatic levels arebased on the following industry classifications. Each ofthe test methods, (i.e., HBM, MM, and CDM) have aset of qualification levels defined. These are containedin Tables A1-1, A1-2, and A1-3 below.Table A1-1 HBM Classification LevelsClass Voltage, V0 ","<"," 2501A 2504991B 5009991C 100019992 200039993A 400079993B \u2265 8000"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 22 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E129-1103 \xa9 SEMI 2003 10 Table A1-2 MM Classification LevelsClass Voltage, VM1 ","<"," 100M2 100199M3 200399M4 \u2265 400 Table A1-3 CDM Classification LevelsClass Voltage, VC1 ","<"," 125C2 125249C3 250499C4 500999C5 10001499C6 15001999C7 \u2265 2000 A1-2.4 Guide RecommendationsA1-2.4.1 At the 180-nm technology node for the year2000, it is assumed that devices (although some maywithstand higher levels of ESD) pass testing at HBMClass 0 (250 V  100 pF = 25 nC), MM Class M1 (100V  200 pF = 20 nC), and CDM Class C3 (500 V  10pF device capacitance = 5.0 nC).A1-2.4.2 This guide recommends (Table 1 in Section12.5) 2.510 nC at the 180-nm node in the year 2000. Itis assumed, for this and all further recommendations,that the device capacitance is 10 pF.A1-2.4.3 For major technology nodes, the allowableESD levels have decreased approximately with thesquare of the ratio of the critical dimension. Theassumption is that energy dissipation capability isproportional to the area of the feature.A1-2.4.4 For example, in Table A1-4 at the 90-nmnode this guide recommends approximately 25% of the180-nm node or 1 nC, at the 50-nm node the value haschanged to 0.25 nC, and at the 25-nm node the value is0.1 nC. Intermediate technology years have beenchanged accordingly.A1-2.5 Recommendations for Particle DepositionA1-2.5.1 SEMI E78 Related Information 1.2.2discusses the enhancement of particle deposition due toelectrostatic fields from charges on the wafer surface.This section attempts to develop the guiderecommendations for minimizing particle depositionbased on that discussion.N/A = cvelectt (1) where N/A equals the particle burden added to a waferduring exposure time t, to a particle concentration c, inan environment characterized by an electrostaticparticle deposition velocity, velect .Table A1-4 Guide Recommendations to Prevent ESDDamageYearNodeElectrostatic Discharge,nC2000180 nm2.510 2002130 nm2.0 2003100 nm1.5 200490 nm1.0 200765 nm0.5 200950 nm0.25 201232 nm0.125 201525 nm0.1 A1-2.5.2 Target values for N/A are given in theInternational Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors(ITRS 2002 Defect Reduction chapter). These targetvalues vary, depending on the type of product, thecritical dimensions of the technology, the type ofprocess, etc. An average of random particles added perprocess step is developed, and for purposes of thisdiscussion will represent those resulting from particledeposition. The variables c and t are process stepdependent and may or may not be controllable.A1-2.5.3 The only variable in Equation 1 that dependson electrical forces is velect Both the particle charge andthe electric field in the vicinity of the wafer affect themagnitude of velect Particle charge is generally unknownunless it is deliberately controlled by a neutralizingaction, and in the absence of this condition, a Fuchs-type charge distribution is a reasonable assumption forthe particle charge. This assumption was used tocalculate the value of E0, the electric field at which velectis equal to the particle deposition velocity fromdiffusion (dominant for small particles).A1-2.5.4 Using the process step values of c and t, andthe value of velect calculated from Equation 10 in SEMIE78 Related Information 1.2.2, the value of N/A for anyprocess step can be estimated. Alternatively, havingtarget values for N/A and c, and estimating the value ofvelect as outlined in the previous paragraph, allows oneto calculate the tolerable value of t:"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 23 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E129-1103 \xa9 SEMI 200311 t = ","[","N/A","]","/cvelect (2)Using higher values of N/A in Equation 2 will increasethe acceptable values of t. Accepting higher values of cwill reduce max t.A1-2.5.5 The value of the electrostatic field is initiallycalculated at a distance of one wafer radius from thewafer. While electrostatic field measurements cancertainly be made at this distance, they are typicallymade at 2.5 cm (1 inch) with common instrumentation.This is described in SEMI E43. Measurements made atthis smaller distance will be proportionally higher, butunder varying measurement conditions, it is difficult todetermine a precise relationship between electric fieldand measurement distance. To provide a safety factor,assume a linear relationship, rather than oneproportional to the square of the distance. For example,with a 300-mm wafer, 3000 V/cm at 2.5 cm wouldresult in 500 V/cm at 15 cm.A1-2.5.6 In SEMI E78, calculations were based on adefect density N/A = 0.016 defects/cm2 and a depositionvelocity velect of 0.0105 cm/s. An example of theresulting calculations is found in SEMI E78 Appendix 1Table A1-2.2, a portion of which is shown in Table A1-5.Table A1-5 SEMI E78 Guide Table A1  2.2 E,V/cm at2.5 cm N/A,defects/cm2v elect ,cm/sct,s/cm3max t inClass 1,s200 0.016 0.0105 1.524 1220 A1-2.5.7 Tables A1-6 and A1-7 below are derivedfrom Table A1-5 above, which is taken from SEMI E78Appendix A1-2.2.2. They contain the sameassumptions used for the SEMI E78 table, but reflectvalues for defect density (N/A) and particle depositionvelocity contained in the ITRS 2002 document for eachtechnology node. Assumptions are: Calculations are made for ISO Class 3 (formerlyFederal Standard 209E Class 1) where c \u2264 0.00124particles/cm3. As contained in both the 1999 and 2002 ITRS,particle deposition velocity is assumed to be 0.01cm/s (2002 ITRS Yield Enhancement Chapter,Notes Table 95a). Calculations are made assumingthe electrostatic deposition velocity, velect, is equalto this value. For N/A = 0.0141 defects/cm2 as specified in the1999 ITRS for the 180-nm node (Defect ReductionChapter, Table 77, assuming Random Defectsper mask layer are all the result of particledeposition), the corresponding table becomes: Table A1-6 Modified SEMI E78 Guide Table A1  2.2E,V/cm at2.5 cm N/A,defects/cm2v elect ,cm/sct,s/cm3max t inClass 1,s190 0.0141 0.01 1.41 1140  The values from the 2002 ITRS (YieldEnhancement Chapter, Table 91) N/A = 0.0093defects/cm2 as specified for the 130-nm node,0.0089 defects/cm2 for the 100-nm node, 0.0059for the 65-nm node, 0.0056 for the 45-nm node,0.0043 for the 32-nm node, and 0.0044 for the 22-nm node technology are used. Calculations are normalized for an exposure timeof 1200 s (i.e., E values multiplied by 1140/1200). Relationship of electrostatic field, technology node,and constant airborne particle concentration areshown in Table A1-7. The years and technology nodes shown in TableA1-7 correspond to those to be used in the 2003ITRS.A1-2.6 Recommendations for Induced ESD DamageA1-2.6.1 The presence of electrostatic fields insemiconductor manufacturing areas also creates thepotential for induced ESD damage. When an isolatedconductor is placed in an electric field, a chargeseparation occurs in the conductor. If the conductormomentarily touches ground, a flow of charge willoccur to the conductor. This flow of charge is apotentially damaging ESD event. If the conductor, nowpossessing excess charge, is removed from the electricfield, a second ESD event can occur when theconductor contacts ground again.A1-2.6.2 The most obvious example of thesephenomena occurs once the semiconductor device ispackaged. The package material is epoxy, an easilycharged insulator. The electric field from the chargedpackage induces a charge on the device leads. ESDevents occur when the leads contact ground duringprocessing."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 24 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E129-1103 \xa9 SEMI 2003 12 Table A1-7 Electrostatic Field Levels  Limit ParticleDeposition in a Class 1 EnvironmentYearNodeN/A,defects/cm2Electrostatic Field, V/cm 2000180 nm0.0141 180 2002130 nm0.0093 120 2003100 nm(2004)(90 nm) 0.0089 114 200765 nm0.0059 75 200950 nm(2010)(45 nm) 0.0056 71 201232 nm0.0043 55 201525 nm(22 nm) 0.0044 56 A1-2.6.3 A second problem for semiconductormanufacturing occurs in the presence of a changingelectric field. This occurs when there is movement ofisolated conductors within an electric field, or the fielditself changes in magnitude. The result is that thecharge, and hence the voltage, induced on theindividual isolated conductors will not always be thesame, creating a potential difference between theconductors. Under the right circumstances, ESD eventscan occur between conductors at different potentials.With the electric field changing, there is also thelikelihood that multiple ESD events will occur.A1-2.6.4 This phenomenon of charge induced bychanging electric fields is mostly a concern in thehandling of photomasks with m and sub-micronfeature sizes. While ESD damage occurred with 5photomasks with 3 to 5-m features, it was infrequent.At the 180-nm technology node, even 5 masks havesub-micron features and the trend is to 4 masks,making the feature sizes even smaller.A1-2.6.5 The problem occurs because a photomask isbasically a large collection of closely spaced, isolatedconductors on an insulating quartz substrate. Thesubstrate is easily charged, creating an electric field.The field changes whenever the spacing between thephotomask and ground changes (e.g., during handlingby robotics). Transporting the photomask, whether instatic dissipative reticle carriers or not, exposes it tochanging electric fields from other charged objects(e.g., equipment panels, windows, work surfaces, and equipment parts). The result is an increasing incidenceof ESD damaged photomasks as geometries shrink.A1-2.6.6 While there have been several studiesdocumenting the existence of the field chargingproblem on photomasks, there is currently a need forfurther research to demonstrate the level at which itoccurs for production facilities. A recent study(Montoya, et al.) was able to produce the followinginformation:1. Testing was done on a photomask test device with1.5-m gaps between features. Approximately 800V/cm (2 kV/inch) of electric field was needed tocause damage.2. Current production 180-nm photomasks are 4with a nominal gap width of 0.72 m (or lessdepending on the technology). ESD should occurat 400 V/cm (1 kV/inch) or less.3. To avoid ESD on 180-nm photomasks, electricfields should be kept below 50% of the damagethreshold, or 200 V/cm (500 V/inch).A1-2.6.7 Table A1-8 below is based on thesemeasurements. It is acknowledged that dischargephenomena may change at very small conductorspacing, and that the relationship to electric field maynot be a linear function of the geometry. The values inTable A1-8 may need to be changed as moreinformation becomes available.Table A1-8 Electrostatic Field Levels  Limit InducedESD Damage on PhotomasksYearNodeElectrostatic FieldLimitsInduced ESD Damage,V/cm Electrostatic FieldLimitsParticle Attraction,V/cm2000180 nm200 (200) 180 2002130 nm144 (150) 120 2003100 nm111 (125) 114 200490 nm100 (100) 114 200765 nm72 (70) 75 200950 nm(45 nm) 55 (50) 71 201232 nm35 (35) 55 201525 nm(22 nm) 27 (25) 56"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 25 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,'SEMI E129-1103 \xa9 SEMI 200313 A1-2.7 Guide RecommendationsA1-2.7.1 This document recommends the valuesshown in parentheses in the second column of TableA1-8 of this Appendix and includes them in Section12.5 Table 1.A1-2.8 Guide Recommendations for EquipmentMalfunctionsA1-2.8.1 Most semiconductor manufacturingequipment should comply with the ESD immunityrequirements of the European Economic Community(EEC).

R1-1 ESD DamageR1-1.1 IntroductionR1-1.1.1 ESD damage to devices occurs when theycome into contact with personnel and facility orequipment surfaces. Either may store a residual chargelarge enough to destroy the device if a discharge occurs.It is also possible that charge stored on insulating partsof products or reticles will induce charges on theirconductive parts. Discharges may occur betweenconductive parts at different potentials or when theconductive parts touch ground. The same types ofinduced charge can be produced when products orreticles are placed in the electrostatic field produced bystatic charge on facility or equipment surfaces that areinsulative or isolated from ground. In thesemiconductor industry, it has been established thatsignificant proportions of customer field returns areattributed to damage resulting from ESD.R1-1.2 Description of ESD Damage MechanismsR1-1.2.1 ESD failures are the result of either a current-induced phenomenon or a charge-induced phenomenon,and the damage can either be junction, contact,dielectric or oxide related. The apparent similarity incurrent-induced damage resulting from ESD due tohuman body model (HBM) discharges or machinemodel (MM) discharges results from the thermal natureof both of these processes. The HBM and MMdamages result when the temperature (joule heating) ofthe region dissipating the ESD pulse energy reaches acritical value and melting occurs.R1-1.2.2 The charged device model (CDM) predictscharge-induced phenomena. For CDM-type discharges,oxide punch through occurs when the ESD voltageapplied across the oxide creates a high enough field tobreak down the oxide. Excessive current flow results,causing an oxide short, but there is no heat transfer(adiabatic process). It should be noted here that thetime duration for typical ESD events from chargedobjects and personnel ranges from 10 to 100 ns, whileCDM-type events occur in less than 1 ns. R1-1.3 Device Testing ModelsR1-1.3.1 Human Body Model (HBM)  The HBM isthe oldest and the most widely used of the three ESDmodels. The model attempts to replicate the dischargewhen a charged human touches a device that is at alower potential. Human capacitance and resistancehave been chosen to be 100 pF and 1500 \u03a9respectively. The values were chosen aftermeasurements were made on humans in varyingpositions with respect to their surroundings. Theresulting discharge waveform has a double exponentialshape with rise time range of 210 ns and a decayconstant (1/e position) of 150 \xb1 20 ns. The typical peakcurrents range from 0.67 A at 1000 V to 2.67 A at 4000V.R1-1.3.2 Machine Model (MM)  The MM isdescribed by the Electronic Industries Association ofJapan (EIAJ) as a worst-case HBM. The modelattempts to replicate the discharge from a metallic armof an automatic handler coming into contact with themetallic leads of a semiconductor device. Acapacitance of 200 pF and ideally zero resistanceproduces a sinusoidal decaying waveform with aneffective pulse duration of 200 ns. The typical peakcurrents range from 1.75 A at 100 V to 14.0 A at 800 V.Note that MM failures occur at 510 times lowervoltage than HBM.R1-1.3.3 Charged Device Model (CDM)  The CDMin its purest form is actually a field-induced modelbecause the device is actually part of model. Thismodel attempts to describe a device which itselfbecomes charged due to an external field, or due totriboelectric charging of the device surfaces. Duringdischarge the parasitics (i.e., capacitance, inductanceand impedance) in the device play a significant role inthe resulting failure. The discharge pulse is a sinusoidalwaveform with an extremely fast rise time of less than500 ps. The waveform decays rapidly with a total pulseduration of less than 5 ns. The peak currents rangefrom 2.0 A at 250 V charging voltage to 18.0 A at 2000V charging voltage.R1-1.3.4 Correlation Between Models  Whether ornot a correlation exists between HBM and MM isdebatable. While some companies report a correlation"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 27 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E129-1103 \xa9 SEMI 200315 of roughly 10:1 between the two models, othercompanies have seen anywhere from 520:1 differencesin passing voltages between the two models. There isalso no established voltage correlation between CDMdamage and HBM or MM ESD events. In equipment,ESD damage events will be related to the MM or CDMtypes of ESD. Users will need to determine the type ofESD hazard to their devices and choose the test methodaccordingly. R1-2 ESD Laboratory Simulation TestingR1-2.1 Description of Test Methods  Test proceduresdiscussed here for ESD simulation conform to thoseestablished by the ESD STM5.1, ANSI ESD STM5.2,ANSI ESD STM5.3.1 and MIL-STD 883 Method3015.7. Details are to be found in these standards.Devices are qualified at a level corresponding to thehighest ESD stress they are able to withstand.R1-2.2 Simulation Test Results  In general all unitsmust be data-logged both pre- and post-stress test. Anyleakage current equal to or greater than a specificamount (company dependenttypically 10 A or less)is flagged as a failure, and any current shift greaterthan about 200 nA is marked on the record.R1-2.3 HBM Stress Testing  A resistance-capacitance (R-C) network is used to simulate the ESDevent. In an HBM ESD Simulator, a high voltage isused to charge the capacitor (100 pF) which dischargesthrough the resistor (1500 \u03a9) into the device under test.The present standard test method requires a minimumof 2 discharges (i.e., 1 positive and 1 negative) pervoltage level.R1-2.4 MM Stress Testing  An R-C network is alsoused in the MM ESD Simulator for ESD testing. Highvoltage charges the capacitor (200 pF) whichdischarges through the short wire (~0 \u03a9) into the deviceunder test. The present standard requires a minimum of6 discharges (i.e., 3 positive and 3 negative).R1-2.5 CDM Stress Testing  The package and leadframe of the device are charged by direct charging orfield induction.R1-2.5.1 For the Direct Charging Method, directcontact is made to one of the device leads connected tothe substrate or bulk material of the device. The deviceis then discharged via a 1-ohm resistor to ground.R1-2.5.2 For the Field Induced Method, the device isplaced on a metallic charging plate with the devicepackaging material touching the plate. Applying avoltage to the charging plate raises the potential of thedevice. The induced voltage on the device isdischarged to ground through a 1-ohm resistor thatcontacts each device lead. The present standard requires a minimum of 6 discharges (i.e., 3 positive and3 negative) from each device lead.

R2-1 Static Charge ControlR2-1.1 It is usually impossible to eliminate staticelectricity from work areas, but with proper use ofequipment and remedial procedures, most staticproblems can be controlled. Many approaches tocontrolling static charge have been tried over the yearsand it is clear that there exists no single method forcontrolling all static charge problems. However, it hasbeen shown that a consistently applied process for staticcharge control greatly reduces problems associated withstatic electricity.R2-1.2 One overriding issue should not be forgotten inthe choice of static control materials and procedures.This is the need for compatibility with the cleanlinessrequirements of the area in which they are installed. Avariety of static control materials are available, butsome may not be cleanroom compatible due to issues ofparticle shedding, outgassing, or their chemicalmakeup. Each manufacturing area in thesemiconductor factory should contain only those staticcontrol materials that are appropriate to the cleanlinessrequirements of the area. Consult ESD TR11 foradditional information. R2-2 Charge GenerationR2-2.1 Triboelectric ChargingR2-2.1.1 A fundamental law of nature states that anelectrostatic charge is generated whenever twodissimilar materials contact and then separate. Thematerials themselves, intimacy of contact, speed ofseparation and a variety of other factors determine theamount or level of electrostatic charge that is generatedduring any given contact and separation event.Predicting the level of charge ahead of time is nearlyimpossible. Due to this unpredictability, the best thatcan be done in a factory setting is to understand thatelectrostatic charge generation will always occur.However, electrostatic charge generation can bemeasured and charge mitigation is normally apossibility. Reducing charge generation requiresmodification of surfaces to increase lubricity (i.e.,reduce friction), increase conductivity (i.e., allowscharges to relax and flow back), and make the surfaceschemically similar. Normally, more than one of the above actions is required to provide a low charge-generating system.R2-2.1.2 While no intrinsic test method exists for thedetermination of triboelectric charge-generationproperties, several practical evaluation techniques thatapply to many factory situations may be found in ESDADV 11.2.R2-2.2 Effect of Humidity on Charge GenerationR2-2.2.1 It is generally understood that at constanttemperature and at increased relative humidity thenormally observed manifestations of static chargegeneration, such as static cling and static shocks, aregreatly reduced. This does not mean that static chargeis not present in the environment. Even at 90% RH,static charge may accumulate at a sufficient level tocause problems with some processes or cause damageto sensitive parts. Most factory processes, includingcleanrooms, are run at a humidity level of 3070%.Within this range, most of the humidity-dependant low-charging materials will function within their intendedspecifications. At lower humidity, surfaces dry out andmay become a source of charge generation.R2-2.2.2 Specifying a humidity level for a factory is areasonably good idea if kept realistic. However,maintaining a minimal level of humidity may be veryexpensive in some areas of the world during normallydry winter months. It could be more important and costeffective to choose materials that provide the requiredfunction for charge generation or dissipation at thelowest expected humidity. Many parts of the worldexperience humidity levels of 10% or less during thewinter months when outside air is brought inside andthen heated to warm interior spaces. In these locations,which include the northern tier of US states andCanada, much of northern Asia, as well as northernEurope, careful attention to material selection is ofmajor importance to assure adequate dissipative andlow charge-generation performance. R2-3 Grounding Conductors and StaticDissipative MaterialsR2-3.1 The primary method of controlling static chargeis grounding. If there is a path for the charge to flow toearth ground, the static charge on facility surfaces,"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 30 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E129-1103 \xa9 SEMI 2003 18 furniture, equipment, materials handled by theequipment, and any ESD-protective materials can berapidly, and harmlessly, neutralized. Providing a pathto ground brings everything to the same zero voltageelectrical potential. All conductors in the environment,including personnel, should be electrically connectedand attached to a known ground. It is important to notethat insulators cannot lose their electrostatic charge byattachment to ground. Other charge-mitigatingtechniques (discussed in later sections) are required toneutralize excessive charge (i.e., electric fieldreduction) on the necessary insulators used in theelectrostatic protective area (EPA), if their charge isconsidered a risk to sensitive parts handled in thatlocation.R2-3.2 Grounding methods and their measurement aredescribed in detail in ESD S6.1. Information onelectrical power grounding, which is a separate issuenot addressed in this document, may be found inANSI/NFPA 70, ANSI/IEEE STD 142, or appropriatecountry guidelines.R2-3.3 Grounded conductors cannot maintain a staticcharge for very long. This is primarily dependent onthe overall electrical resistance of the system. Systemresistance includes the resistance of the item beinggrounded, the contact resistance at the interfacebetween items and the resistance in the actualgrounding path. Since resistance of the system groundpath determines the rate of discharge, it determines theamount of protection provided to ESD-sensitivedevices. A permanent connection to ground willcertainly prevent any charge from building up on anobject and its subsequent transfer to an ESD-sensitivedevice. However, if an ungrounded, charged objectcontacts a material with too low a resistance to ground,a damaging discharge may occur. Even if no directdamage occurs, the ESD event creates EMI that mayaffect the operation of nearby production equipment.R2-3.4 It should be noted that attaching a largemetallic object (e.g., a stainless steel work surface) toground through a high resistance will not prevent adischarge from occurring to the large metallic object.The high capacitance of the metallic object, withrespect to the ESD-sensitive device, can still result inESD damage or EMI.R2-3.5 To prevent these conditions from occurring, theproper resistance for the ground path should be chosen.A class of materials has been developed, called staticdissipative materials, which help to control dischargerates when materials are placed in contact. Staticdissipative materials are created by lowering theresistivity of insulating materials through the additionof conductive particles, carbon particles, or chemicaladditives. When connected to ground, these materials slow the discharge rate from nanoseconds (typical formetal-to-metal contact) to as long as hundreds ofmilliseconds (depending on the size of the materialsinvolved). While a discharge occurs to allow chargeequalization with ground, a rapid, spark-producingdischarge may not occur.R2-3.6 In modern production equipment, the frame andother machine elements are normally metallic and thusconductive. These machine elements are often coveredwith static dissipative materials. In these designsituations, the conductive frame should be attached toground without any added resistance to provide aground plane. The dissipative surface over theconductive frame provides charge-drainingcharacteristics suitable for reducing risk of damagefrom rapid discharges.R2-3.7 Static dissipative materials will need to retaintheir dissipative properties over the range oftemperature and humidity conditions they willencounter, and not change significantly over time. Incleanrooms they should also meet requirements foravoiding micro-particle production and outgassing.R2-3.8 Measurements of the resistance and resistivityof static dissipative materials are used to characterizetheir effectiveness in a static control program.Measurements should be made of the materialsthemselves, as well as their performance in theirinstallation location. There are several measurementmethods available depending on the application.Acceptable resistance ranges may depend on the ESDsensitivity of the products or photomasks that arehandled in the area. These will need to be determinedby the end user and the material suppliers.R2-3.9 See the following test methods for resistancemeasurements of various items: ESD STM11.11: Surface Resistance Measurementof Static Dissipative Planar Materials ANSI ESD STM11.12: Volume ResistanceMeasurement of Static Dissipative Planar MaterialsBoth test methods characterize the resistivity orresistance of either static dissipative or conductivematerials. These test methods can be used forconstruction materials, work surfaces, furniturecomponents and most planar surfaces. They may alsobe used for packaging and transport materials. ANSI ESD S4.1 can be used to measure theresistance to a groundable point of these materialsonce they are in place. This can be done for worksurfaces, construction materials (other thanflooring), and other planar surfaces on furniture orequipment."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 31 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E129-1103 \xa9 SEMI 200319  ESD STM7.1 can be used to measure the resistanceto a groundable point and resistance point-to-pointfor flooring, ANSI ESD STM12.1 can be used to measure theresistance to a groundable point for components ofchairs. Resistance characteristics of the wrist straps usedto ground personnel are covered in ANSI ESDS1.1. Cleanroom garments may be tested with themethods of ANSI ESD STM2.1. R2-4 Static Charge Decay TimeR2-4.1 In some cases, it will be important to know theactual time it takes to remove a known amount ofcharge from an object. FED-STD-101 Method 4046 is often used forhomogeneous materials. ANSI ESD STM4.2 is used to measure decay timeof worksurface materials.R2-4.2 Please be aware that static decay time may notfully characterize an item or a material. However, theinformation gathered in a decay time test may providevaluable insight into the electrostatic performance of anitem or material when used in conjunction with otherdata such as resistance or resistivity. Decay time isonly useful for materials with a highresistance/resistivity. For materials with resistance lessthan 10 10 \u03a9, decay time does not apply because theequipment used is unable to measure decay times fasterthan 0.01 s. R2-5 Measuring Static Charge Levels onPersonnelR2-5.1 Since personnel are mobile electricalconductors, they pose a significant hazard in any ESD-susceptible workplace. Thus, grounding of personnel isamong the most important of all static control technicalrequirements. All of the industry program managementstandards accepted around the world require groundingof personnel as a foremost requirement. The mostimportant consideration for personnel in a properlydesigned electrostatic protective area (EPA) is tomaintain the resistance to ground at ","<"," 35 M\u03a9 foroperations handling parts sensitive to above 100-VHuman Body Model sensitivity. For areas handlingparts susceptible to less than 100-V HBM, theresistance-to-ground specification should be reduced toless than 10 M\u03a9 to ground. Testing by the ESDAssociation has shown that at 35 M\u03a9 to ground, aperson can generate up to 100 V by vigorous movement such as sliding feet on the floor. At 10 M\u03a9 to ground,the maximum voltage potential drops to about 6 V, alevel that is highly unlikely to contribute to damagingeven the most sensitive parts (consider the resistancediscussion above). Standard wrist strap test methodsare described and defined in ANSI ESD S1.1.R2-5.2 For high-risk applications, advanced testing ofpersonnel grounding systems may be required. Amodern concept for continuous verification ofpersonnel grounding includes wrist strap constantmonitor systems. Choosing an appropriate system ofconstant monitoring requires an understanding of theactual performance measurement. To verify personnelgrounding, it is important to measure the condition ofthe total system including the interaction of all thecontact resistances, together with wrist strap bands andskin as well as ground cord, and shoes or shoe strapswith skin or stocking moisture. Make sure allmeasurements include all the resistive interconnectionsof the grounding systems. Do not do systemmeasurements without including all the componentsand personnel.R2-5.3 A common grounding appliance for personnelis a wrist strap and connecting ground cord attached toa common point grounding terminal at a workstation.Since this methodology is most suitable for seatedpersonnel, it is a stated requirement in all of therecognized static control programs (i.e., ANSI ESDS20.20, JEDEC JESD625, IEC 61340-5-1, and EN61340-5-1 (formerly CENNELEC 100015-1).R2-5.4 Another common methodology for groundingmobile personnel is a static control floor with staticcontrol footwear. If this concept is used as the primarygrounding system, the resistance to ground has to be thesame as for a wrist strap. A useful test method forresistance to ground of personnel through a floor-footwear system is ANSI ESD STM97.1. Analternative methodology in ANSI ESD S20.20 wherethe resistance to ground of the floor-footwear system isabove 35 M\u03a9 is to measure the voltage of a personrelative to ground using ESD STM97.2. This methodmeasures the charge generation characteristics of aperson moving about on a floor.R2-5.5 Clothing coverings using approved staticcontrol materials are often a requirement, especially incleanrooms. When ESD issues are involved, garmentsneed to be tested using approved test methods. Auseful method is ANSI ESD STM2.1.R2-5.6 Additional static control information, usefulwhere personnel are concerned, may come from ESDTR03 for gloves and finger cots, ESD TR05 forgarments, and ESD TR06 for triboelectrically chargedgarments."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 32 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E129-1103 \xa9 SEMI 2003 20 R2-6 Neutralizing Charge on InsulatorsR2-6.1 Static charge on a conductive or static-dissipative object can be controlled if the object isprovided with a path for the charge to flow to earthground. Unfortunately, grounding methods do notprovide complete protection from static-relatedproblems. Even when earth grounding is an option, it issubject to human error. In applications wherecontamination is an issue, additives and carbon particlesused in static-dissipative materials may become sourcesof contamination themselves.R2-6.2 While charge is mobile in a conductor (or in astatic-dissipative material), in insulators charge is notmobile, and earth grounding is not an effective meansof eliminating the static charge. More often than not,the product itself uses insulating materials, makingearth grounding unavailable as an option. While siliconis a semiconductor, its oxide coating transforms it intoan insulator. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is used inmany chemical processes, and quartz in high-temperature processes. Epoxy and ceramic packagesare used for integrated circuits. Insulators are easilycharged, retain their charge for long periods of time,and are often close to the product.R2-6.3 Dealing with static charge on insulators andisolated conductors will often require the use of sometype of ionization or surface-resistance modification.Ionizers are the most effective means of dealing withstatic charges on insulators and isolated conductors ifthe surface cannot be modified by coating or treatmentwith some form of surface-dissipative or low-chargingantistatic agent. R2-7 IonizationR2-7.1 For purposes of static charge control, ions aremolecules of the gases in air (i.e., nitrogen, oxygen,water vapor, carbon dioxide) that have lost or gained anelectron. Ions are present in normal outside air but areremoved when air is subjected to filtration and airconditioning. Ionization systems work by increasingthe conductivity of the air by supplying ionized gasmolecules. Another way of looking at the applicationof ionization is to interpret the function as supplyingopposite polarity charge from the air to surfacescharged to the opposite polarity. When ionized aircomes in contact with a charged surface, the chargedsurface attracts ions of the opposite polarity. As aresult, the static charge that has built up on products,equipment and surfaces is neutralized.R2-7.2 The most common methods of producing airions are radioisotopes and corona discharge resultingfrom the electric field created when high voltage isapplied to a sharp point. R2-7.3 The radioisotope most commonly used toproduce ionization is polonium-210, an alpha particleemitter. The alpha particle collides with thesurrounding gas molecules, dislodging electrons. Gasmolecules that lose an electron become positive ions.The free electron is quickly captured by another neutralgas molecule, creating a negative air ion. Note that theprocess always creates pairs of positive and negativeions.R2-7.4 The corona discharge method produces a veryhigh electric field that interacts with the electrons in thesurrounding gas. The polarity of the ions depends onthe polarity of the high voltage on the emitter point.Ionizers using the corona discharge method will ofteninclude some type of monitoring and feedback circuitryto assure that equal numbers of positive and negativeions are created.R2-7.5 Ions of opposite polarity to the charged surfaceare required. Either polarity of static charge may becreated on facility and equipment surfaces, or on theproduct. Ionizers may be installed on the ceiling of theroom or may be hung from the ceiling using appropriatemounting methods. Ionizers are installed inminienvironments, particularly in the product load andunload areas. Ionizers may also be installed in theinterior of process equipment. No single ionizer type orinstallation location is sufficient to solve all the staticproblems in the semiconductor facility.R2-7.6 Ionizers should deliver ionization over a widerange of humidity and temperature conditions. Back-end assembly and test areas often do not have the levelof temperature and humidity control found in front-endwafer production. Ionizers installed in the crampedspaces of production equipment will be close to theproduct, in areas surrounded by grounded metal parts.Ionizers should isolate the emitter points from both theproduct and adjacent grounded surfaces. Ionizersshould produce sufficient ions to discharge static onsurfaces and on products moving at high speeds despitelosses to ground. Most ionizers require maintenanceand periodic verification of their performance. Theappropriate ionizer installation will need to beengineered for each specific application. R2-8 Packaging MaterialsR2-8.1 Types of PackagingR2-8.1.1 Many forms of flexible and rigid packagingare used to protect ESD-susceptible items. Bags,boxes, wraps, tape and reel, pouches, cushioning foams,totes, tubes and numerous other forms of containers areavailable for any imaginable application. Each of thesecontainer forms is available in an ESD-protectiveversion. Application in cleanroom environments adds"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 33 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E129-1103 \xa9 SEMI 200321 additional requirements to the ESD-protectivepackaging properties. Some of these considerationsmay actually preclude the ability to provide ESDprotection. Therefore, there may often be a tradeoffbetween ESD protection, cleanliness, and other requiredmaterial properties.R2-8.1.2 The dissipative property for ESD protectionrequires some type of chemical, metallic or elementaladditive to the bulk of the material or the surface of anESD-protective item. Adding a highly conductive layerwithin the structure of the material or item provides theelectrostatic-shielding property. Any additive ortreatment may contribute to contamination concerns forapplication in cleanrooms.R2-8.1.3 Making a material low charging (antistatic)requires modification of the surface to decrease surfaceresistance and reduce friction. Often, low chargingmaterials allow a transfer of materials to contactingsurfaces to make the actual surfaces similar inchemistry. Materials with chemically similar surfacesusually do not show high levels of charge generationwhen placed into contact and then separated from eachother. A downside to this process is the potentialcontamination issue that may be involved if thematerials are used in clean areas. Take care in selectinglow-charging materials if cleanliness is a major issue.This concern includes ionic contamination, non-volatile-residue and outgassing.R2-8.2 Material GuidelinesR2-8.2.1 Physical Guidelines  The required materialphysical properties depend on the application involved.The selection process for a packaging material orsystem should consider all of the physical attributesgenerally associated with protecting an item duringtransit or storage. The physical requirements normallyevaluated for any packaging system and associated testmethods are shown in Table R2-1.Table R2-1 Packaging System Physical PropertiesPhysical Properties Test MethodTensile Strength ASTM D882Elongation ASTM D882Tear Strength ASTM D1922Puncture Resistance FED-STD-101/2065Seam Seal Strength (ifapplicable)ASTM F88 Light Transmission ASTM F1003Moisture Vapor Transmission(if applicable)ASTM F1249 Light Transmission Rate (ifapplicable)ASTM D1003 R2-8.2.2 ESD-Protective Packaging Guidelines  Thetype of packaging required for ESD-susceptible itemsdepends on where the item is going. Packagingmaterials used inside of an ESD-protected work areaare static dissipative or low charging. When sensitiveitems are moved outside of the protected area, the levelof protection should increase to include electrostaticdischarge shielding. Some extremely sensitive itemsmay require additional EMI or RFI protection providedby heavier layers of shielding. Materials that provideincreased shielding may also provide moisture barrierprotection for enclosed items. The necessary electricalproperties for packaging materials that are normallyevaluated are shown with their associated test methodsin Table R2-2.Table R2-2 ESD-Protective Packaging PropertiesElectrical Properties Test MethodSurface Resistance ESD STM11.11Volume Resistance ANSI ESD STM11.12Shielding ANSI ESD S11.31Static Decay FED-STD-101/4046 R2-8.2.3 Contamination Control Guidelines Contamination issues are not limited to particles.Plastic processing additives to plastic packaging andhandling materials, chemical and molecularcompatibility should also be of concern. Users canevaluate plastic packaging and handling materials usingpublished standard test methods. There are multipletest methods and procedures to identify contaminationproperties, as shown in Table R2-3. The user is advisedto select the method best suited to their products thatrequire protection.Table R2-3 Contamination Control PropertiesContamination Properties Test MethodParticles ISO Std 14644IEST-STD-CC1246DIDEMA M9ARP 598KSC-C-123Non-Volatile Residue IDEMA M7ASTM E1235ASTM F331IPA extraction methodOutgassing IDEMA M11 DynamicHeadspace AnalysisASTM E595Ionics IDEMA M12Extractable/leachable cationlevels by ion chromatography"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 34 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E129-1103 \xa9 SEMI 2003 22 R2-9 Problem of Controlling Static Charge inManufacturing EquipmentR2-9.1 The interior of high-speed productionequipment is a challenge to static control methods. Thehigh cost of production space requires equipmentoccupying the space to be compact and operate at ashigh a speed as practical. Product moves through smallspaces at high speed by a variety of robotic and othermechanisms. Triboelectric charging (i.e., chargegeneration due to friction or contact and separation ofdissimilar materials) and contact with ground arealmost unavoidable.R2-9.2 Grounding of equipment parts that contact theproduct presents added difficulties when the equipmentparts are moving at high speeds. Dissipating chargefrom insulating surfaces and integrated circuit (IC)packages may be difficult if the charged surfaces arenot accessible. Using ionizers in these confined spacespresents challenges.R2-9.3 Measuring the effectiveness of static controlmethods in equipment will take some ingenuity. Testmethods are contained in SEMI E78 as well as ESDSP10.1. R2-10 Measurement of Charge and Potentialon Moving ObjectsR2-10.1 The fundamental problem in measuringaccumulated charge on moving items in-situ is that onlythe static voltage or electrostatic field can be measuredand not the actual charge. Direct measurements ofstatic charge can be made with a coulombmeter orFaraday Cup (Pail), but only on stationary objects.Therefore, any measurements or alarm limits formoving objects can be set only in terms of accumulatedstatic voltage or electric field.R2-10.2 Another difficulty in measuring the staticvoltage or electric field from accumulated charge onmoving items in a manufacturing process is theresponse time of the instrumentation. Non-contactinstruments measure the electric field emanating fromthe surface of a charged object and this takes a finiteamount of time. While some instrument technologiesare faster than others, the measurement tools selectedfor any application should consider the speed of theprocess. A similar situation occurs in selection ofmitigation techniques, in particular ionizers, as speed ofneutralization depends solely on the number of ionspresent in the immediate environment.R2-10.3 Electrostatic charge on an object (has to be aconductor to be accurate) is related to the electricalpotential between the object and ground and the capacitance of the object relative to ground and thesurroundings. There is a measurable relationshipbetween an electric field measurement and the potentialof the conductive object. For insulators, electrostaticcharge cannot be determined by measuring electricfields. The electric field measurement on an insulatordoes not directly relate to electrostatic charge sotherefore it cannot be used to determine the level ofelectrostatic hazard directly. A charged insulator canonly discharge from a very small area upon contact.The electric field from a charged insulator causesdamage only when it is of sufficient strength and theESD-susceptible item is grounded while in the presenceof that electric field.R2-10.4 ESD-instrument manufacturers are developingnew instruments that have improved response time overearlier offerings. Much of this effort supports ESDSP10.1, which describes measurement of voltage andcharge in Automated Handling Equipment. Theseinstruments will enable static measurements, even inhigh-speed automated equipment.R2-10.5 Non-contact voltmeters are an importantinstrument type for measuring the electric field fromcharged objects. Reducing the response time for thisclass of instruments has been of major importance toallow meaningful measurement in moving systems.R2-10.6 Although the coulombmeter and Faraday Cupcan only be used to measure static charge on stationaryobjects, they can still be useful in understanding thecharge generation characteristics of parts travelingthrough process paths in component handlingequipment. Direct charge measurements combinedwith estimates of electrical potential from the electricfield from a charged object can be used to determineappropriate ionization levels, surface treatment needs,grounding faults and provide insight into ESD risksassociated with component movement. R2-11 Standards and Process ControlR2-11.1 Without any doubt, the most important aspectof electrostatic control today is the advance made instandardization and process control. Several industrystandards that cover the development andimplementation of an ESD Control Program werereleased in the years since 1999. The four mostimportant standards are as follows: IEC 61340-5-1  This document is a result ofinternational cooperation at the InternationalElectrotechnical Commission - TechnicalCommittee TC 101  Electrostatics.

Thecontent of this document is identical to IEC 61340-5-1. JEDEC JESD625  A revision of EIA 625, thisdocument provides a great deal of informationregarding ESD-program planning, implementationand auditing. The technical requirements areharmonized fairly well with the above referenceddocuments. ANSI ESD S20.20  Technical requirements aresimilar to those stated in the above documents butthe administrative requirements are quite different.ANSI ESD S20.20 was written to comply with ISO9001-2000 type requirements for validation,verification and maintenance. Adopted by the USDepartment of Defense (DoD), NationalAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),Food and Drug Administration (FDA), andnumerous corporations, ANSI ESD S20.20 is theonly ESD-program standard that has an officialcertification program. ISO 9000 registrars havebeen trained and others are in training at this timeto allow them to provide officially recognizedaudits leading to certification granted by the ISOregistrar and the ESD Association. The ESD Association is the certifying body thatrecognizes trained registrar companies. At thistime, four registrar companies have trainedpersonnel on staff that can support certificationaudits throughout most of Asia, North America andmuch of Europe. Numerous other registrars arebeing asked by their ISO/QS clients about ANSIESD S20.20 certification so the list of certifiedregistrars is expected to grow over time.

R3-1 BackgroundR3-1.1 Electrostatic discharges (ESD events) generatestrong electromagnetic fields that cause undesirablebehavior of electronics equipment generally byinducing extraneous voltages and currents into itscircuits. There are many other sources ofelectromagnetic interference (EMI) in thesemiconductor-manufacturing environment that alsocause similar effects. EMI is propagated via differentmeans such as air, cables and even imperfectly installedgrounding networks.R3-1.2 There are several regional and internationalstandards regulating EMI susceptibility and parasiticemission of electronics products. Compliance ofequipment with those standards is not a guarantee ofcomplete immunity to EMI for several reasons, amongwhich are: EMI conditions in semiconductor manufacturingenvironments often exceed the limits set forth bythose standards. EMI performance of equipment can besubstantially affected by installation, althoughEMC compliance testing does not take this intoaccount. Interconnection of tools in the actual productionenvironment creates a network of tools, which hasits own EMI properties that are never tested duringproduct design and approval cycle.There are neither guidelines nor regulations at themoment to guide EMI-conscious design of facilities orto properly maintain them in that regard. It would bebeneficial to provide (at minimum) guidelines tocleanroom designers and maintenance personnel toassist them in implementing good EMI practices in theirfacilities. R3-2 EMI GENERATIONR3-2.1 Controlling EMI generation is a key componentin EMI management. There are several types ofgenerators of electromagnetic emission that caneventually cause EMI. ESD events (discharges)  Parasitic emission from equipment Intentional emission from equipment that useselectromagnetic fields as a part of the processR3-2.2 An ESD event is characterized by a very rapidtransfer of electric charges. As a result, a very fasttransient electromagnetic field is generated. The effecton the equipment is determined not only by the voltagethat was discharged by the ESD event, but also by thecharge that was dissipated during the event and theproperties of contact. Another important parameter inassessing EMI impact of ESD events is the propagatingproperties of the discharging parts. More effectiveantennas lead to a higher magnitude of electromagneticfield.R3-2.3 Parasitic emissions from equipment are a sideproduct of normal operation of equipment. ThoughFCC, CE or similar regulations tightly control parasiticemission, in actual installations these emissions areoften higher than expected. This is often attributed tohigh tool densities, extra long cabling, partially engagedconnectors, and often-open covers that are supposed toattenuate electromagnetic emission from these cables.R3-2.4 Intentional radiation generated by some typesof tools causes substantial EMI as a part of normaloperation. Examples include CVD tools and ionimplanters.R3-2.5 EMI PropagationR3-2.5.1 Controlling the propagation path is anotherkey component in EMI management. Electromagneticfield propagation paths include: Radiated  via air Conducted  via cables and wires Combined  an example of such is EMI picked upfrom the air by a cable or a wire and carried intoequipment as a conducted emission.R3-2.5.2 Poor grounding and power distributionnetworks provide paths for EMI to propagate from onetool to another. It is not uncommon to witness EMIfrom one corner of a cleanroom to manifest itself inanother, distant corner."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 38 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E129-1103 \xa9 SEMI 2003 26 R3-2.6 The following categories of EMI arerecommended for consideration in setting limits: Continuous radiated emission Continuous conducted emission Transient radiated emission Transient conducted emission EMI levels on the ground and on the power linesIt is anticipated that FCC and CE regulations would beconsidered as one of the factors in setting the limits, butsurveys of the actual environment in the factory willalso need to be considered. R3-3 EMI Effect on EquipmentR3-3.1 There are three main ways EMI can affectequipment:R3-3.1.1 Destruction  The signals created by EMI inthe circuit exceed the breakdown threshold ofcomponents, which leads to their destruction. This isespecially relevant to conducted EMI.R3-3.1.2 Malfunction  EMI injects pseudo-legitimatesignals into the circuit, which leads to that circuitsmalfunction. Such malfunction may range fromcomplete lockup to unwanted operation of the tool.This is frequently misdiagnosed as software errors.Often, this type of malfunction involves several toolsconnected together.R3-3.1.3 False Sensor Readings  Signals induced byEMI add to the signals coming from sensors and leadsequipment to misread sensor data. R3-4 EMI MeasurementsR3-4.1 Measuring EMI can be a very effective tool inESD management in the cleanroom, as EMI is asignature that ESD events are occurring. The followingare some of the parameters and test methods that arerecommended to be checked during such audits.R3-4.2 Radiated EMI Levels Near Equipment  Bothcontinuous and transient (peak) should be measured andidentified.R3-4.3 Conducted EMI on Cables  Both continuousand transient (peak). Due to practical considerations,an acceptable method will have to be devised tomeasure conducted EMI on hard-to-reach cables.R3-4.4 Electromagnetic emissions generated by ESDevents have unique properties. These include: Very short rise time  as short as hundreds ofpicoseconds,  Very short duration  from a few nanoseconds toseveral hundred nanoseconds, Very broad frequency range (up to several GHz),and Often high magnitude.There are several types of equipment available to detectand measure electromagnetic fields from ESD events.R3-4.5 AM RadioR3-4.5.1 Since electromagnetic fields from ESD eventsare manifested as short bursts of energy, they may bedetected by a conventional AM radio tuned to afrequency free of radio stations. The radio producesclicks when it detects ESD events. The AM radio hasdifficulties picking up weak and very rapid discharges,and in industrial environments it is likely to pick upnoise from normal equipment operation.R3-4.6 EMI LocatorsR3-4.6.1 Several types of EMI Locators are available,including portable handheld types and largerinstruments. The simplest type provides both a visualand audible indication of the transient EMI from anESD event. Although it can discriminate between twosensitivity levels for EMI, it gives no informationregarding the magnitude of the ESD event thatproduced the EMI. Their frequency response is alsolimited to approximately 150 MHz and they may missthe faster EMI signals.R3-4.6.2 A second type of EMI Locator is a general-purpose electromagnetic field strength meter with abandwidth (up to 2 GHz) to measure EMI from ESDevents. It has a directional antenna to help identifysources of emission, and provides outputs for emissionlevels and the counting of ESD events, including timestamping. This can be very useful in correlating ESDevents with equipment malfunctions. Some units willalso provide discrimination of multiple ESD events andprovide output signals directly to a computer or factorymanagement system.R3-4.7 High-Speed Storage OscilloscopesR3-4.7.1 An oscilloscope equipped with properantennae provides the most comprehensive informationabout waveform and magnitude of EMI caused by ESDevents. The minimum requirements for an oscilloscopeused for this purpose are a 500-MHz bandwidth and a5-gigasamples/s sampling rate. Instruments with lesserperformance specifications would either miss ormisinterpret EMI parameters.R3-4.7.2 The use of a high-speed oscilloscope shouldbe accompanied by the use of a proper antenna forreceiving the electromagnetic fields. For time domain"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 39 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E129-1103 \xa9 SEMI 200327 measurements it is important to use an antenna with aflat frequency response since frequency correction thatis common in the frequency domain is not possible fortime domain measurements. Another important note isthat a typical oscilloscope captures only one event (i.e.,first or last one, depending on trigger setting), missingmultiple events that are common.R3-4.7.3 Spectrum analyzers common in EMC test andwireless communication are not practical for detectingEMI from ESD events due to their unacceptably lowacquisition speed.R3-4.8 Below is comparison Table R3-1 of EMI/ESDmeasurement instruments. R3-5 EMI and GroundR3-5.1 An essential component of EMI management isa consideration of EMI in grounding. High impedanceto ground at high frequencies prevents EMI from beingdissipated. Long ground wires act as receivingantennae that inject high-frequency signals into tools.A common ground for several tools, with highimpedance to the rest of the grounding network,facilitates propagation of EMI from one noisy tool toanother.

(As defined in SEMIE57.)5.2.4 horizontal datum plane  a horizontal planefrom which projects the kinematic-coupling pins onwhich the carrier sits. On tool load ports, it is at theload height specified in SEMI E15 and might not bephysically realized as a surface.

(As defined in SEMI E127.)5.2.6 measurement module  an equipment modulewhose intended function is to measure or inspect theproduct and to report the results. Measurement of theproduct is the factorys means of gaining feedback onthe manufacturing process. (As defined in SEMIE127.)5.2.7 nominal wafer-seating plane  horizontal planethat bisects the wafer pick-up volume. (As defined inSEMI E1.9.) 6 Requirements6.1 The IMM is required to mate with an interface asdefined by SEMI E63. This includes meeting therequirements for the hole opening, bolt hole pattern,and other relevant requirements. Note that certainrequirements in SEMI E63, such as y76 (facial datumplane when carrier is undocked), do not have relevancefor the IMM but will not be in conflict.6.2 Use of Datum Planes  The location in spacewhere a substrate is delivered to an IMM is theintersection of three orthogonal datum planes defined inother standards: the facial datum plane, the nominalwafer-seating plane and the bilateral datum plane. TheBOLTS plane, as in SEMI E63, is defined to be parallelto, and at a distance of y70 from the facial datum plane.6.2.1 Bilateral Datum Plane  All bilateraldimensions of the interface are symmetric about thebilateral datum plane as shown in Figure 1.6.2.2 Facial Datum Plane  This is the vertical plane,parallel to the BOLTS plane, which bisects thesubstrate at the insertion and removal position of thesubstrate inside of the IMM. The distance from theBOLTS plane to the facial datum plane in the IMM isdetermined by y70 of SEMI E63.6.2.3 Nominal Wafer-Seating Plane  The nominalwafer-seating plane is the horizontal plane within theIMM where a substrate is to be loaded to or unloadedfrom by the tool. It can be anywhere between the givenminimum and maximum values that follow. This rangeis not defined by a single standard, rather it results froma combination of dimensions of SEMI E1.9, SEMIE15.1 and SEMI E47.1. (See Figure 1.)6.2.3.1 The minimum value for a nominal wafer-seating plane is the sum of (H + z44 + z8), measuredfrom the floor.6.2.3.2 The maximum value for a nominal wafer-seating plane is calculated by (H + z44 + z8 + (25-1) ","*","z12), measured from the floor.6.2.3.3 For both calculations, H is from SEMI E15.1,z44 is from SEMI E47.1, and z8 and z12 are fromSEMI E1.9.6.3 Internal Clearances  There are requirementsrelating to clearances inside the IMM. These relate torobot arm requirements for substrate handoff, and canbe referenced from SEMI E1.9 and SEMI E47.1 as thesame restrictions apply.6.3.1 This includes clearance in front of the wafer set-down location of radius r3, and heights bounded by z11and z10 relative to the nominal wafer-seating plane.All clearance requirements above the highest and belowthe lowest slot from SEMI E1.9 and SEMI E47.1 must"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 43 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E131-0304 \xa9 SEMI 20043 be followed depending on the nominal wafer-seatingplane selected.6.4 Maximum Outer Dimensions  If the IMM isintended to be located at the front side of a tool (whereload ports are usually located), the outer dimensions ofthe IMM shall not exceed the volume as it would beused, when a load port is attached to a BOLTS-Minterface.6.4.1 Depth  The depth of the IMM located at thefront of the process tool shall not exceed the maximumdepth of a load port. The entire depth of the IMM shallnot exceed the sum of y70 + y76 + D (from SEMI E63and SEMI E15.1 respectively), as measured from theBOLTS plane.6.4.1.1 The IMM shall not extend toward the toolbeyond the BOLTS plane, except for possibletemporary use of the reserved space defined in SEMIE63.6.4.2 Width  If locating the IMM adjacent to anotherload port, there are width requirements defined by thecarrier centroid spacing dimension S from SEMI E15.1.6.4.2.1 If locating the IMM adjacent to an occupiedload port containing a FOUP with handles, then thedesign of the width should not compromise the C1clearance dimension from SEMI E15.1.NOTE 3: Most tools today are designed with the dimensionS chosen for spacing of boxes with handles. If the IMMwidth exceeds twice the x50 dimension for a FOUP withhandles (from SEMI E47.1) then the IMM may not complywith the C1 requirement for integration with most existingtools.6.4.3 Height  A height H2 (from SEMI E15.1) is theupper maximum boundary for the IMM when located atthe front of the tool. 6.4.4 Exclusion Volume  There is an exclusionvolume, defined by dimensions Ld and Lh at the bottomrear of the IMM reserved for requirements from SEMIE64. The width of this exclusion volume is the fullwidth of the tool.6.4.5 The front of the IMM (towards the tool) betweenthe floor and up to the height of a load port, as given bythe sum of H (SEMI E15.1) plus z79 (SEMI E63), isidentical with the BOLTS plane. Above this height, thefront of the IMM is limited by the equipment boundaryas defined in SEMI E15.1.NOTE 4: The BOLTS plane and the equipment boundary aredefined by a different set of dimensions and thus are atdifferent positions. The BOLTS plane is located moretowards the tool. 7 Related Documents7.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E6  Guide for Semiconductor EquipmentInstallation DocumentationSEMI E51  Guide for Typical Facilities Services andTermination MatrixSEMI E62  Specification for 300 mm Front-OpeningInterface Mechanical Standard (FIMS)SEMI E101  Provisional Guide for EFEM FunctionalStructure ModelSEMI E106  Provisional Overview Guide to SEMIStandards for Physical Interfaces and Carriers for 300mm Wafers"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 44 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E131-0304 \xa9 SEMI 2004 4 plane Equipment Side ViewFront View L (E64) Top View bilateral datum floor (E63)(when carrier is undocked)facial datum plane (E63)and removal)substrate insertion(when carrier is docked;facial datum plane BOLTS plane(E63)CL CL LC (E64)Exclusion volume (E64)hL d (E15.1)boundary (E63)BOLTS plane H2 (E15.1) wafer-seating plane:nominalupper limit for wafer-seating plane:nominallower limit for +(25-1)","*","z12 (E1.9)+z8 (E1.9)+z44 (E47.1)H (E15.1) +z8 (E1.9)+z44 (E47.1)H (E15.1) +z79 (E63)H (E15.1) D (E15.1) D1 (E15.1)y76 (E63)y70 (E63) y70 (E63)y76 (E63) S (E15.1)D (E15.1) D1 (E15.1) Figure 1IMM Dimensional Requirements"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 45 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E131-0304 \xa9 SEMI 20045 RELATED INFORMATION 1CALCULATION OF NOMINAL WAFER-SEATING PLANE NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E131 and was derived from work by theoriginating task force.
