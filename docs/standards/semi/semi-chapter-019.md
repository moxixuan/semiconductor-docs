SEMI E118-1104E © SEMI 2002, 20043 6 Conventions6.1 State Model Methodology6.1.1 This document uses the Harel state chart convention for describing dynamic operation of defined objects. Theoutline of this convention is described in an attachment of SEMI E30. The official definition of this convention isdescribed in State Charts: A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems written by D. Harel in Science of ComputerProgramming 8, 19872.6.1.2 Transition tables are provided in conjunction with the state diagrams to explicitly describe the nature of eachstate transition. A transition table contains columns for Transition number, Previous State, Trigger, New State,Actions, and Comments. The trigger (column 3) for the transition occurs while in the previous state. Theactions (column 5) includes a combination of: Actions taken upon exit of the previous state. Actions taken upon entry of the new state. Actions taken which are most closely associated with the transition.6.1.2.1 No differentiation is made between these cases.6.2 Object Notation6.2.1 The object models in Related Information 2 use the Object Modeling Technique (OMT) developed byRumbaugh, James, et al, in Object-Oriented Modeling and Design3. An overview of this notation is provided inSEMI E39, Object Services Standard: Concepts, Behavior, and Services. Num Previous State Trigger New State Actions Comments 6.3 Service Message Representation6.3.1 Services are functions or methods that may be provided by either the equipment or the host. A servicemessage may be either a request message, which always requires a response, or a notification message, that does notrequire a response.6.3.2 Service Definition6.3.2.1 A service definition table defines the specific set of messages for a given service resource, as shown in thefollowing table: Message Service Name Type Description Type can be either N = Notification or R = Request & Response. 6.3.2.2 Notification type messages are initiated by the service provider (e.g., the equipment) and the provider doesnot expect to get a response from the service user. Request messages are initiated by a service user (e.g., the host).Request messages ask for data or an activity from the provider. Request messages expect a specific responsemessage (no presumption on the message content).6.3.3 Service Parameter Dictionary6.3.3.1 A service parameter dictionary table defines the description, format and its possible value for parametersused by services, as shown in the following table: 2 Elsevier Science, P.O. Box 945, New York, NY 10159-0945, http://www.elsevier.nl/homepage/browse.htt3 James Rumbaugh, Michael Blaha, William Premerlani, Frederick Eddy, William Lorensen, Object-Oriented Modeling and Design, EnglewoodCliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1991.

SEMI E118-1104E © SEMI 2002, 2004 4 Parameter Name Description Format: Possible Value 6.3.3.2 A row is provided in the table for each parameter of a service.6.3.4 Service Message Definition6.3.5 A service message definition table defines the parameters used in a service, as shown in the following table: Parameter Req/Ind Rsp/Cnf Comment 6.3.5.1 The columns labeled REQ/IND and RSP/CNF link the parameters to the direction of the message. Themessage sent by the initiator is called the Request. The receiver terms this message the Indication or the request.The receiver may then send a Response which the original sender terms the Confirmation.6.3.5.2 The following codes appear in the REQ/IND and RSP/CNF columns and are used in the definition of theparameters (e.g., how each parameter is used in each direction): Code DescriptionM Mandatory Parameter  Must be given a valid value.C Conditional Parameter  May be defined in some circumstances and undefined in others. Whether a valueis given may be completely optional or may depend on the value of the other parameter.U User-Defined Parameter.- The parameter is not used.= (For response only.) Indicates that the value of this parameter in the response must match that in the primary(if defined). 7 Overview7.1 The Wafer ID Reader Model defines the behavior and services (functions). The Wafer ID Reader is a smallintelligent system, typically used as a subsystem within equipment.7.1.1 The primary functionality of the Wafer ID Reader is to read the identifier of the wafer (Wafer ID).7.1.2 The acronym WIDR is used to refer to the Wafer ID Reader.7.1.3 An object model for the WIDR is provided in Related Information 2  Object Model.7.2 Number of Heads7.2.1 A WIDR provides one or more ID reader heads and is connected to an upstream controller by a singleinterface. This allows the upstream controller to control either one head or multiple heads using the same interfacespecification.7.2.2 Single Head Configuration7.2.2.1 In the case of a single head, the head may be presented as an integrated part of the WIDR.7.2.3 Multiple Head Configuration7.2.3.1 In the case of multiple heads, some services are logically performed by the WIDR, and the individual headslogically perform others. The individual heads are numbered sequentially and may be referenced individually by theupstream controller. Note that the upstream controller does not communicate directly with the heads. Allcommunications are between the upstream controller and the WIDR unit.7.2.3.2 In the multi-head case, the WIDR shall allow independent control of the heads. Multiple transactionsinvoking services performed by the individual heads may be open at the same time. For example, when a read

&lt;!-- Page 11 --&gt;

SEMI E118-1104E © SEMI 2002, 20045 command is sent to one head, the host can send additional commands such as a read command and a statusconfirmation command to another head before the first head sends the response to the first command.7.3 Upstream Controller7.3.1 The WIDR provides certain services when requested by the upstream controller. The upstream controllersends a message requesting the specified service, and the WIDR sends a message with the response.7.3.2 This standard assumes that an upstream controller initiates each service message to the WIDR, and the WIDRsends its response to the upstream controller. The upstream controller must watch the response time to monitor thecommunication timeout. This standard will define the recommended method for handling exceptions caused bytimeouts.7.3.3 In addition, some WIDR may provide asynchronous notification to the upstream controller. Examples of thisinclude, but are not limited to, the detection of a fault condition resulting in an alarm. Asynchronous notification isnot required for compliance to this standard. 8 Attributes8.1 An attribute is an item of information about an entity that is maintained and is available by request. There iscertain information concerning the WIDR that is of potential interest to the upstream controller, including themanufacturer, the model, and the serial number of the device. This information is considered as attributes of theWIDR and is available on request.8.2 WIDR Attribute Definition Table8.2.1 Table 1 defines the attributes of the WIDR subsystem.Table 1 WIDR Attribute DefinitionsAttribute Name Description Access Reqd Form FundamentalConfiguration Number of heads.

SEMI E119-1104 © SEMI 2002, 20041 SEMI E119-1104MECHANICAL SPECIFICATION FOR REDUCED-PITCH FRONT-OPENING BOX FOR INTERFACTORY TRANSPORT OF 300 mmWAFERS This specification was technically approved by the Global Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee and isthe direct responsibility of the North American Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee. Current editionapproved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004. Initially available atwww.semi.org September 2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published November 2002. 1 Purpose1.1 This standard partially specifies a reduced-pitchfront-opening box for interfactory transport of 300 mmwafers (FOBIT). This reduced-pitch box, with acapacity of 25 wafers but with the approximate physicalvolume of a 13-wafer FOUP, is intended to reduce thecost of transporting wafers between IC manufacturingsites. To leverage current industry 300 mm technology,this reduced-pitch front-opening box is intended tointerface with 13-wafer FIMS, as specified in SEMIE62. 2 Scope2.1 This standard is intended to set an appropriate levelof specification that places minimal limits oninnovation while ensuring modularity and inter-changeability at all mechanical interfaces. Only thephysical interfaces for FOBIT are specified; nomaterials requirements or micro-contamination limitsare given. However, this standard has been written sothat both metal and injection-molded plastic FOBITscan be manufactured in conformance with it.2.2 This standard assumes that the FOBIT is intendedfor use in the interfactory transportation of wafers. Thefollowing boundary conditions were used in thecreation of this specification: Minimizing the pitch between wafers will reducethe cost of transporting wafers. The FOBIT will be used for interfactorytransportation of both processed and unprocessedwafers. The box will have a 25-wafer capacity. Random access of wafers, using edge grip handlingdevices, is not a requirement for this standard. The FOBIT will be compatible with the following300 mm Standards: 13-wafer FIMS Interface (SEMI E62) 300 mm Load Port (SEMI E15.1)  Kinematic Coupling (SEMI E57) The FOBIT will not necessarily be compliant withthe following 300 mm Standards due to waferrestraint requirements and product applicationsduring transportation: 300 mm Front-Opening Unified Pod (SEMI E47.1) 300 mm Open Cassette (SEMI E1.9) 300 mm Front-Opening Shipping Box (SEMIM31) The technical requirements of this standard arewritten for the transportation of nominal thicknesswafers, as defined by SEMI M1.15.2.3 This reduced-pitch, 25-capacity FOBIT is designedfor use with the 13-capacity FIMS interface, asspecified in SEMI E62.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E1.9  Mechanical Specification for CassettesUsed to Transport and Store 300 mm WafersSEMI E15  Specification for Tool Load PortSEMI E15.1  Specification for 300 mm Tool LoadPortSEMI E47.1  Provisional Mechanical Specificationfor Boxes and Pods Used to Transport and Store 300mm WafersSEMI E57  Mechanical Specification for KinematicCouplings Used to Align and Support 300 mm WaferCarriersSEMI E62  Provisional Specification for 300 mmFront-Opening Interface Mechanical Standard (FIMS)

SEMI E119-1104 © SEMI 2002, 20043 5 RequirementsThe FOBIT has the following components and sub-components:Key: Required feature Optional feature Door on front Holes for latch keys that lock the door to theFIMS interface when the door is unlatchedfrom the box Holes for registration pins Door presence sensing areas Top Top robotic handling flange (optional) Interior Non-removable cassette with supports for 25wafers Wafer capture mechanism 2 end-effector exclusion zones Sides Ergonomic manual handles (optional) Bottom 5 carrier sensing pads Center retaining feature Front retaining feature 4 info pads 2 advancing box sensing pads 3 features that mate with kinematic couplingpins and provide a 10 mm lead-in 3 features that mate with kinematic couplingpins and provide a 15 mm lead-in (optional) 2 bottom side rails for use with roller conveyoror forklifts (optional)5.1 Kinematic Couplings  The physical alignmentmechanism from the FOBIT to the tool load-port (or anest on a vehicle or in a stocker) consists of features(not specified in this standard) on the top entity thatmate with three or six pins underneath as defined inSEMI E57. The three features that mate with thekinematic coupling pins must provide a lead-in capability that corrects a FOBIT misalignment of up tor69 in any horizontal direction.5.2 Inner and Outer Radii  All required concavefeatures may have a radius of up to r65 to allowcleaning and to prevent contaminant build-up. Allrequired convex features may also have a radius of upto r66 to prevent small contact patches with largestresses that might cause wear and particles. Note thatthese limits on the radius of all required features arespecified as a maximum (not a minimum) to ensure thatthe required features are not rounded off too much. Thelower bound on the radius is up to the FOBIT supplier.Note also that this radius applies to every requiredfeature unless another radius is called out specifically.A required feature is an area on the surface of theFOBIT specified by a dimension (or intersections ofdimensions) that has a tolerance and not just amaximum or minimum (such as the edges of the robotichandling flange).5.3 Door  It is recommended that the FOBIT be in ahorizontal orientation when it is opened or closed(corresponding to the front side of the cassette wherewafers are accessed so the door is perpendicular to thewafers and parallel to the facial datum plane). The doorand its frame must be designed to mate with a port thatconforms to SEMI E62. Specifically, the FOBIT doorand its frame must have surfaces that mate with the sealzones and the reserved spaces for vacuum application(which includes all of the circles bounded by r38 exceptfor the holes for the registration pins at the center ofeach circle) defined in Sections 5.3 and 5.6 of SEMIE62 (which specifies r38). These FOBIT door andframe surfaces must be a distance of y52 from the facialdatum plane and must have a flatness of y42. Nosurface on the FOBIT door may project further from thefacial datum plan than the door seal zone and thereserved spaces for vacuum application. The door of theFOBIT must also be designed so that when the FOBITis pressed against the FIMS port, both latch keys on theport are inserted to their full length. Furthermore, whenthe latch keys are turned more than 45° toward theposition that unlocks the FOBIT door, the latch keyholes on the door must be such that the door is notremovable from the latch keys.5.4 Wafer Capture and Centering  When the FOBITis closed, the wafers must be captured in the FOBIT toprevent movement during subsequent handling,including transportation. It should be noted that wafersare typically transported in a vertical orientation andgenerally require support from a secondary package.

SEMI E119-1104 © SEMI 2002, 2004 4 5.5 Wafer Orientation and Numbering  The wafersmust be horizontal when the FOBIT is placed on thekinematic coupling, and the wafers slots are numberedin increasing order from bottom to top (so the bottomwafer is wafer number 1, the next wafer up is wafernumber 2, etc.).5.6 Internal Horizontal Dimensions  Figure 1 showsa cross-section of the horizontal boundaries of theFOBIT side domains (which contain the parts of theFOBIT higher than z6 above the horizontal datum planeand lower than z15 above the top wafer). In this andfollowing figures, the heaviest lines are used forsurfaces that have tolerances (not surfaces that haveonly maximum or minimum dimensions). Table 1defines the dimensions shown in this figure. 5.7 Internal Vertical Dimensions  Figures 2 through5 show the vertical dimensions of the internal FOBIT.Note that z8 (the height of the bottom nominal wafer-seating plane above the horizontal datum plane) and z12(the distance between adjacent nominal wafer seatingplanes) are given as absolute distances with notolerance. This means that the sum of actual heightvariations in the FOBIT from the kinematic coupling tothe supporting features holding each wafer must becontained within the tolerance of z10 with no furtherstack-up at each higher wafer. The method for meetingthis requirement is left up to the FOBIT supplier.

The top of thiscylindrical section is z11 above the nominal wafer-seating plane and its bottom is z10 above the nominal wafer-seating plane. The implications for waferpositioning of the tolerance on r2 are as follows. Thewafers should be placed in the FOBIT within a circle ofradius corresponding to the smaller bound on r2 toavoid touching the edge of the wafer to the side of theFOBIT. Once the wafer has been placed, the FOBIT

&lt;!-- Page 35 --&gt;

SEMI E119-1104 © SEMI 2002, 20047 must not allow a wafer to move outside of a circle ofradius corresponding to the larger bound on r2. Thereare two exceptions to this limit on wafer movement.When the wafer is pushed toward the rear of theFOBIT, the location of the wafer is defined by thewafer pick-up volume (see Section 5.7.3). When theFOBIT is gently tilted forward up to 45°, the wafersmay slide forward, but it is recommended that they notextend further than y20 from the facial datum plane.5.7.2 Wafer Extraction Volume  The open space forthe wafer extraction volume includes a cylindricalsection with radius r3 and a main axis parallel to and y1in front of the nominal wafer centerline. The top of thiscylindrical section is z11 above the nominal wafer-seating plane and its bottom is z23 above the nominalwafer-seating plane. The wafer extraction volume alsoincludes the extrusion out the front of the FOBIT of this cylindrical section. The implications for waferextraction of the definition of dimension r3 (r3 ≥ r2 +1) are as follows; the FOBIT must give an extra 1mm(0.04 in.) of horizontal clearance once the wafer ispicked up from wherever it ends up (within the boundsof r2) after transport in the FOBIT.5.7.3 Wafer Pick-Up Volume  If a wafer is placed inthe wafer set-down volume and is then pushed towardthe rear of the FOBIT, then the entire bottom of thewafer must be contained in the wafer pick-up volume.However, if the wafer is not pushed toward the rear ofthe FOBIT, then the wafer may only be somewherewithin the wafer extraction volume. The wafer pick-upvolume is defined by a cylindrical section with radiusr1 and a main axis at the nominal wafer centerline. Itstop and bottom are the upper and lower tolerance of z10around the nominal wafer-seating plane. z 8 = 3 5 x 3 ≥ 1 2 5 z 1 2 = 6 . 2 5 z 1 2 = 6 . 2 5 b il a t e r a ld a t u mp la n e h o r i z o n t a ld a t u m p la n e b o t t o mn o m in a lw a f e rp la n e z 6≤ 2 8 . 5 Figure 5Lower Cross-Section at Facial Datum Plane

SEMI E119-1104 © SEMI 2002, 20049 5.9 Human Handles  All handles for use by humansmust either be contained within the maximum outerdimensions of the FOBIT, be detached when not in use,or be retractable into the maximum outer dimensionswhen not in use. Although such handles may extendpast x53, they must still be contained within the upperlimits of x50, y40, and r67. Handles for use by humans(if present) must follow SEMI S8, and they mustrequire the use of both hands (each using a full wrap-around grip, given the minimum clearance requirementin SEMI E15.1). Automation handling features shall notbe considered dual purpose unless they are designed tomeet SEMI S8 guidelines. 5.10 Automation Handling Features  On the top ofthe FOBIT, there is an optional robotic handling flangefor manipulating the FOBIT as illustrated in Figure9. n the bottom of the FOBIT, there are optional railsfor use with roller conveyors or forklifts as shown inFigures 6, 7 and 10. Although they are only required toextend y58 behind the facial datum plane on both theleft and right sides, it is recommended that they be aslong as possible. Beyond y58, only the lower bound onz43 applies. These optional conveyor rails (defined byx56, x57, y58, and z43) are located on the left and rightbottom edges of the front-opening box and also havevertical cylindrical pin holes for forklift centering(defined by d65). y51 ≥ 140facialdatum plane horizontal datum ofbox nest or loadport planey53 ≤ 190 y50 ≥ 130 y46= 71 ± 1y44≤ 53 z49≤ 8z48≥ 15 z47= 221± 1 y40 ≤ 116 humanhandle(optional) front sideof theFOBITwherewafersareaccessed y58 ≥ 75z41 ≥ 0 d65 = 10 ± 0.5z65 ≥ 7 z43 = 2±1 y52 = 165.5 ± 0.5(at seal zones, etc.)≤ 166 (elsewhere) Figure 6Side View of FOBIT

This may be needed to prevent the FOBITfrom being knocked off the kinematic couplings by theaction of pushing the FOBIT against the front-openinginterface. The front retaining feature contains a rampthat a wheel might roll up while the FOBIT is beingpushed toward the front-opening interface. The arm with the wheel (not specified here) then holds theFOBIT down on the kinematic couplings. The center-retaining feature consists of an oblong slot with achamber above it. The FOBIT can be clamped onto thekinematic couplings by inserting an oblong head on ashaft (not specified here) through the slot and rotating it90° in either direction. Either retaining feature wouldonly engage after the FOBIT is fully seated on thekinematic coupling pins. Either retaining feature must

&lt;!-- Page 40 --&gt;

SEMI E119-1104 © SEMI 2002, 2004 12 be able to withstand a force in any direction of at leastf60. It is recommended that SEMI E15.1 tool load portsbe designed to accommodate the minimum holedimensions of the retaining features to ensure carrierinterchangeability. Projections on the tool load portsthat mate with the retaining features should also notinterfere with the misalignment correction function ofthe kinematic couplings. All dimensions of the FOBIT(such as the wafer location, etc.) are defined withreference to the kinematic coupling pins, and aredesigned so that all of the their features are in theproper location only when the FOBIT is held in placeon the kinematic coupling pins by gravity only.5.12 Sensing Pads and Info Pads  The FOBIT musthave the same carrier sensing pads as defined in SEMIE1.9, including the info pads that communicateinformation about the carrier such as the carriercapacity (number of wafers) and type (cassette or box).See SEMI E1.9 for information about info pad configurations for different wafer carriers similar toFOBITs including front-opening shipping boxes (asdefined in SEMI M31) and single-wafer interface(SWIF) systems (as defined in SEMI E103). Twoadditional sensing pads (that can be used continuouslywhile the FOBIT is advancing into the FIMS interface)must be located near the center of the bottom at thesame distance from the horizontal datum plane as thecarrier sensing pads (See Figure 12). In addition, thesurfaces on the door of the FOBIT that mate with theseal zones and the reserved spaces for vacuumapplication may also be used for door-presence sensing.It is intended that the FOBIT have the capability toallow customization of the info pad configuration.Therefore, the purchaser of 300 mm carriers needs tospecify the desired info pad orientation (up or down)for all four locations, as defined in the Appendix ofSEMI E1.9. facialdatumplane bottomconveyor rail centerretain-ingfeaturey62≤ 28 x56 = 194.75 ± 0.25(at bottom rail)x53 ≤ 195 (elsewhere) y52 = 165.5 ± 0.5(at seal zones, etc.)≤166 (elsewhere) r60 = 16± 0.5 r64 ≤ 9.5 x64≥ 35 y58≥ 75 bilateraldatumplane x57 ≤ 180 y53 ≤ 190 front side of the FOBIT where wafers are accessed y65≥ 104 x60= 8.0 ± 0.5 r61 ≥ 16 frontretainingfeature y67= 25 r67 ≤ 240 y64= 42.1± 0.5y63= 37.3± 0.5d65 =10 ± 0.5 x65 = 187.5 x68≥ 25 x50 ≤ 215 (at human handle) Figure 10Bottom View of FOBIT

SEMI E124-1103 © SEMI 20031 SEMI E124-1103PROVISIONAL GUIDE FOR DEFINITION AND CALCULATION OFOVERALL FACTORY EFFICIENCY (OFE) AND OTHER ASSOCIATEDFACTORY-LEVEL PRODUCTIVITY METRICS This provisional guideline was technically approved by the Global Metrics Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Metrics Committee. Current edition approved by the North AmericanRegional Standards Committee on July 27, 2003 and September 3, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.orgSeptember 2003; to be published November 2003. Originally published July 2003. 1 Purpose1.1 This guide describes metrics that show how well afactory is operating compared to how well it could beoperating (for the given product mix). These metricscan be used for tracking factory performance (in value-added production) in a way that rewards goodoperational decisions and that is not easy to adverselymanipulate. They can be used in a process of ongoingimprovement that can be visible to all levels of asemiconductor manufacturing organization.1.2 The metrics in this guide are intended forevaluating the relative efficiency of factory productionafter the factory is in production, not for capacityanalysis while the factory is being designed orredesigned. However, some of these metrics can beused in factory simulations for choosing equipment setsand scheduling policies. 2 Scope2.1 To evaluate the overall effectiveness of a factory,there are at least three things in need of measurement:production, utilization of assets, and costs. This guidefocuses on evaluating production; utilization of assetsand costs (as well as other economic factors) areoutside its scope. See Section R3-1.1 in RelatedInformation 3 for a discussion of metrics in other areas.2.2 This guide describes metrics for an entireintegrated production line. Multiple production lines inthe same factory may be evaluated separately if they donot share resources (such as material handling orproduction equipment).2.3 This guide is provisional because overall factoryefficiency (OFE) is a new concept. Once the metricshave been validated by collecting data in productionfactories, computing the metrics, and evaluating theirsensitivity to the data, this guide should be modifiedand upgraded from provisional status (as specified inthe SEMI regulations). Also, additional supplementalmetrics may be defined, and the metric definitionsgiven here may be expanded to truly comprehendassembly operations. NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 In the context of this guide, it is important to notethat factory-level productivity is impacted greatly byfactors beyond the factory itself, including materialavailability, efficiency of product device designs, andcustomer demand.3.2 The metrics in this guide are intended forevaluating the overall efficiency of factory production,not for diagnosing problems (or opportunities forimprovement) in the factory, although some componentmetrics can be used that way. See Section R3-1.2 inRelated Information 3 for a discussion of thedifferences between the two kinds of metrics.3.3 This guide provides metrics and calculations formeasuring the overall productivity only ofmanufacturing environments (such as wafer fabs, flatpanel factories, and some disk-drive productionfacilities) in which product substrates move through thefactory with no assembly or disassembly processes.These metrics can be applied in a post-wafer back-endchip production facility if the lead frames areconsidered to be consumable materials (not units ofproduction in their own right). However, in the futurethis guide may be extended to comprehend other, morecomplex manufacturing environments (includingassembly operations). 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E10  Specification for Definition andMeasurement of Equipment Reliability, Availability,and Maintainability (RAM)SEMI E79  Standard for Definition and Measurementof Equipment Productivity

SEMI E124-1103 © SEMI 2003 2 NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 TerminologyNOTE 1: All of the metrics defined below should becalculated with respect to the period being measured.5.1 Definitions5.1.1 actual throughput rate  the finished units outdivided by the total time (shows how fast finishedwafers flow out of the factory). See Equation 19.5.1.2 availability efficiency (time divided by time) the fraction of total time that the equipment is in acondition to perform its intended function (SEMI E79).5.1.3 average cycle time  the (unweighted) averageof cycle time over all of the units of production infinished units out.5.1.4 average work in process (WIP)  the averagecycle time multiplied by the actual throughput rate(shows how many eventually finished units ofproduction fill the pipeline on average). SeeEquation 15.NOTE 2: This metric is not an average of the WIP over time,since that would include units that are later scrapped beforefinishing.5.1.5 balance efficiency  the critical WIP divided bythe process capacity (measures how well the equipmentsets are balanced). See Equation 5.5.1.6 best-case cycle time  the larger of thetheoretical cycle time and the quotient of the averageWIP divided by the bottleneck throughput rate (showsthe best cycle time that the factory can do given theWIP loading). See Equation 18.5.1.7 best-case throughput rate  the smaller of thebottleneck throughput rate and the quotient of theaverage WIP divided by the theoretical cycle time(shows the best throughput rate that the factory can dogiven the WIP loading). See Equation 20.5.1.8 bottleneck throughput rate (Rmax)  the upperbound on the factory throughput rate imposed by thecurrent bottleneck equipment set. If a process changefor a product causes this metric to change, it should beconsidered a different product for the purposes ofperforming these computations. See Equation 17.NOTE 3: This metric is similar to (but not the same as) thetheoretical unit throughput by recipe metric (see Section5.1.32) from SEMI E79.NOTE 4: This metric is not an average over the bottleneckthroughput rates of each product.5.1.9 critical WIP (W0)  the theoretical cycle timemultiplied by the bottleneck throughput rate (gives the WIP level that theoretically allows the factory to havethe highest throughput rate with the shortest cycletime). See Equation 10.5.1.10 cycle time  the amount of time a unit ofproduction spends as WIP in the factory.5.1.11 finished units out  the number of units ofproduction that finish processing and testing during theperiod being measured.5.1.12 good unit equivalents (GUE) out  the(possibly non-integer) number of units of productionrequired to contain all of the good product that exits thefactory during the period being measured. SeeEquation 12.5.1.13 line yield  the fraction of units leaving thefactory that have finished processing (measures relativematerial losses such as scrapped units). See Equation 6.5.1.14 normalized production efficiency  theproduction efficiency to the power of the normalizingexponent (measures the normalized efficiency of theprocess with respect to factory dynamics). SeeEquation 4.5.1.15 normalizing exponent  power that normalizesthe production efficiency so that a value of Ω fornormalized production efficiency indicates that thefactory is performing at the level of the threshold case(which divides a well run factory from one badlyoperated). See Equation 9. See Sections R1-1.7 andR1-1.8 in Related Information 1 for a discussion of themeaning of the threshold case and a derivation ofmathematical expression for the normalizing exponent.5.1.16 operational efficiency (time divided by time) the fraction of equipment uptime that the equipment isprocessing actual units (SEMI E79).5.1.17 overall equipment efficiency (OEE) (timedivided by time)  a metric of equipment performance,expressing the theoretical production time for theeffective unit output divided by the total time (SEMIE79).5.1.18 overall factory efficiency (OFE)  the volumeefficiency multiplied by the yield efficiency (shows howwell a factory is operating compared to how well itcould be operating for the given product mix). SeeEquation 1.5.1.19 process capacity  the maximum number ofunits of production that can be processedsimultaneously throughout the factory (including unitsbeing transported by material handling vehicles). SeeEquation 11.5.1.20 production efficiency  the throughput-rateand cycle-time efficiency multiplied by the WIP

SEMI E124-1103 © SEMI 20033 efficiency (measures the efficiency of production withrespect to factory dynamics). See Equation 8.5.1.21 quality efficiency (time divided by time)  thetheoretical production time for effective units dividedby the theoretical production time for actual units(SEMI E79).5.1.22 scrapped units out  the number of units ofproduction (including broken units, external rework,etc.) that exit the factory without finishing productionduring the period being measured.5.1.23 set of bottleneck equipment (Fe\*)  thecollection of production equipment of the same typethat has the highest average operational efficiency inthe factory during the period being measured. Elementsof this set are indicated by f, and the equipment typeis indicated by e\*.NOTE 5: This set of bottleneck equipment might not be theequipment set (often the expensive lithography exposureequipment) that was planned to be the bottleneck in thefactory, but rather the equipment set with the highest averageoperational efficiency (the fraction of time in use whenavailable) during the period being measured. If anotherequipment set experiences significantly lower availabilitythan expected, it might become the bottleneck. Thus, the setsof bottleneck equipment may be different between twoadjacent time periods, and the set of bottleneck equipment forthe period combining the two adjacent periods may bedifferent from the other two sets.5.1.24 set of equipment of type e (Fe)  the collectionof production equipment of type eE in the factory.Elements of this set are indicated by f.5.1.25 set of equipment types (E)  the collection ofthe different types of production equipment in thefactory, including metrology equipment and materialhandling vehicles and conveyors. Elements of this set(which are the different types of equipment) areindicated by e.NOTE 6: If units are transported manually between processsteps, then the human transporters (and any carts ormechanized vehicles that they operate to perform themovement) should be considered a type of equipment for thepurpose of computing the metrics in this guide. This is notintended to dehumanize people, but to ensure that the manualtransport time is included in such metrics as theoretical cycletime.5.1.26 set of process steps of product type p onequipment type e (Spe)  the collection of the differentprocess steps (including metrology inspection andmaterial handling transport) planned for a unit ofproduction of product type p on equipment of type e inthe factory. Elements of this set are indicated by s. 5.1.27 set of product types (P)  the collection of thedifferent types of products manufactured in the factory.Elements of this set are indicated by p.5.1.28 test yield  the fraction of units leaving thefactory that have finished processing and have passedfinal testing (measures relative losses due to parametricor functional failure). See Equation 7.5.1.29 theoretical cycle time (Tmin)  the minimumtime required to process a unit of production throughthe factory (including material handling transport time)if the unit never has to wait for equipment or a vehicleto become available and if sequence-dependent set-upsnever have to be performed. This is also known as theraw process time. If a process change for a productcauses this metric to change, it should be considered adifferent product for the purposes of performing thesecomputations. If more than one product (or processflow) is represented in the output, an average is takenover each of the products theoretical cycle timeweighted by the fraction of that product found infinished units out. See Equation 16.NOTE 7: This metric is similar to (but not the same as) thetheoretical production time per unit (THT) metric (see Section5.1.30) used in SEMI E79 from CSM 21 and 421.5.1.30 theoretical production time per unit (THT) (timeper unit)  for a given production recipe performed bya given processing module, the minimum time tocomplete processing on one unit of productionassuming no efficiency losses are present. Thedetermination of theoretical production time per unit isbased on continuous operation of the processingmodule, where the module is assumed to operate in anideal condition. For equipment cycles thatsimultaneously process more than one unit, theoreticalproduction time per unit is the minimum time toperform the cycle on an equipment load whose size isoptimized for throughput divided by the number ofunits in that optimized load (CSM 21 and 42).5.1.31 theoretical throughput rate  the smaller of thebottleneck throughput rate and the quotient of the WIPcapacity divided by the theoretical cycle time (gives anunreachable upper bound on the factory throughputrate). See Equation 21.5.1.32 theoretical unit throughput by recipe (units pertime)  for a given production recipe, the number ofunits per period of time that theoretically could beprocessed by the equipment. For each recipe, 1 CSM 21: Closed-Loop Measurement of Equipment Efficiency &Capacity, 1995: and CSM 42: Productivity Metrics for Flexible-Sequence Cluster Tools, 1998; Engineering Systems Research Center,University of California, Berkeleyhttp://esrc.berkeley.edu/csm/csmreports.html.

&lt;!-- Page 49 --&gt;

SEMI E124-1103 © SEMI 2003 4 theoretical unit throughput is equal to the reciprocal oftheoretical production time per unit (SEMI E79).5.1.33 throughput rate  the number of units ofproduction that pass through a process per period oftime.5.1.34 throughput-rate and cycle-time efficiency  thebest-case cycle time divided by the average cycle time(shows the relative performance of the factory withrespect to throughput rate and cycle time). SeeEquation 13. See Section R1-1.6 in RelatedInformation 1 for a discussion of this metric.5.1.35 total time  all time (at the rate of 24 hours perday, seven days per week) during the period beingmeasured. In order to have a valid representation oftotal time, all six basic equipment states must beaccounted for and tracked accurately (SEMI E10).NOTE 8: For factory-level productivity metrics, total timeshould be larger than the average cycle time (and isrecommended to be twice as large as the average cycle timeand larger than the cycle time of any individual unit infinished units out).5.1.36 unit (of production)  the basic entity in thefactory (such as a wafer in a fab, a glass pane in a flatpanel factory, or a die in a post-wafer back-end chipproduction facility) which acts as a product substrate(and moves through the factory with no assembly ordisassembly processes). Only product units areincluded (as opposed to test wafers or other non-product devices).NOTE 9: This definition is more restrictive than that given inSEMI E10 in order to be sufficiently specific.NOTE 10: Production lot sizes can (and typically do) includemultiple units of production, and units can (and typically do)contain multiple product devices (usually of the same type butpossibly of different types). The user may chose to have theproduction lot be the unit of production, but that is notrecommended because: the choice of lot size (and its inherent waiting time whileits individual units are serially processed) would nolonger be a relevant factor in evaluating how well thefactory is running, lots can vary in size (even in the same factory), the meaning of unit would be inconsitent with otherSEMI standards, and scrapped units out would not be properly accounted for.5.1.37 uptime (equipment uptime)  the hours whenthe equipment is in a condition to perform its intendedfunction. It includes productive, standby, andengineering time, and does not include any portion ofnon-scheduled time (SEMI E10). 5.1.38 volume efficiency  the normalized productionefficiency times the balance efficiency (measures thetotal efficiency of the process with respect to factorydynamics). See Equation 2.5.1.39 WIP capacity (Wmax)  the maximum numberof units of production the factory can contain (includingon shelves, in stockers, on material handling transportvehicles, on equipment load ports, in internal carrierbuffers, and in process chambers, but not includingspace required for non-product units such as testwafers, dummy wafers, and monitor wafers).NOTE 11: This is not a practical WIP level, because itrepresents total gridlock of the factory.5.1.40 WIP efficiency  the quotient of the smaller ofthe critical WIP and the average WIP divided by thelarger of the two (measures the efficiency of WIP levelswith respect to factory dynamics). See Equation 14.5.1.41 WIP turnover  the finished units out dividedby the average WIP (shows how often the inventory ofwork in process was replaced during the period beingmeasured). See Equation 22.5.1.42 work in process (WIP)  the number of units ofproduction that have been released into the factory buthave not yet been scrapped, sent out for externalrework, or finished processing through all of theirproduction steps.5.1.43 yield efficiency  the line yield times the testyield (shows overall material efficiency). See Equation3.NOTE 12: This metric is similar to (but not the same as) thequality efficiency metric (see Section 5.1.21) from SEMI E79. 6 Calculated Metrics6.1 Figure 1 shows how the terms defined in Section 5feed into each other. Arrows go from subordinate termsto the term in which they are cited as a part of theprimary definition. Shown in the top row (in redrounded rectangles) are the basic building-block metricsfor which no equations are needed in this guide; theremaining metrics have their equation numbers given.At the very bottom is the overall factory efficiencymetric into which almost everything feeds, althoughmany of its subordinate terms are useful in their ownright (if data availability or reliability is a problem).Along the left side (in green rounded rectangles) are thequality metrics that show the efficiency of the processwith respect to use of materials. The remainder of themetrics (in blue rectangles) are production metrics thatshow the efficiency of the process with respect tofactory dynamics (without the effects of yield and scraplosses). Related Information 1 gives an exposition ofthe underlying science behind these production metrics.
