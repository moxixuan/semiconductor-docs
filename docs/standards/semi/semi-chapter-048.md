Additionally, the command priorities are to be utilized during execution of thecommands to the following level: any High priority command will cause all other commands that are not Highpriority to be usurped. That is to say that all other commands will modify the execution steps to allow the Highpriority commands to be completed in the minimal elapsed time possible.

SEMI E84-0305 © SEMI 1999, 20051 SEMI E84-0305SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/OINTERFACE This specification was technically approved by the Global Physical Interfaces & Carriers Committee and isthe direct responsibility of the Japanese Physical Interfaces & Carriers Committee. Current edition approvedby the Japanese Regional Standards Committee on November 24, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.orgJanuary 2005; to be published March 2005. Originally published June 1999; last published March 2004. 1 Purpose1.1 Due to the migration to large wafer sizes, future semiconductor factories will use extensive automated materialhandling systems (AMHS) to transfer wafer carriers, including FOUPs and open cassettes, of increasing weight. Theparallel input/output (PI/O) control signals between the production equipment and the AMHS must be better definedfor more reliable and efficient carrier handoffs (load/unload) at production equipment load ports.1.2 The purpose of this specification is to enhance the capabilities of the parallel I/O interface defined in SEMI E23in order to support improvements in the reliability and efficiency of carrier transfer. The enhanced capabilitiesinclude continuous handoff, simultaneous handoff, and the capabilities of error detection on the interface.NOTE 1: The specifications in this document shall be considered independent from the specifications in SEMI E23; therefore,use of this specification does not require SEMI E23. 2 Scope2.1 The scope of this specification is limited to communications associated with the material handoff operationsbetween the active equipment (for example, AMHS equipment including AGV, RGV and OHT) and the passiveequipment (for example, production equipment including process and metrology equipment; stockers, etc). Thisscope also extends to interbay AMHS active equipment (i.e., OHS and stockers equipped with transfer devices) andpassive equipment (i.e., OHS and stockers not equipped with transfer devices). This specification defines theenhanced parallel I/O interface signals used to handoff carriers between the production equipment and the AMHS.Figures 1 and 2 show examples of types of AMHS equipment.2.2 This enhanced carrier handoff parallel I/O interface specification includes: Signal definition including load port assignment signals (6.1), Carrier handoff sequence definitions and time diagrams (6.2), Error indication, detection, and recovery (6.3 and 6.4), Connector type, signal, and pin assignment (6.4), and Interface sensor unit size to be located at load port defined by SEMI E15.1 (applicable for systems designed tohandle 300 mm wafer carriers).2.3 The enhanced carrier handoff parallel I/O interface controls the handoff of a carrier to and from the passiveequipment by the active equipment. This parallel I/O interface only controls the automated handoff operation of thecarrier. The handoff is the operation in which a carrier is transferred from one piece of equipment to another. Boththe active and passive equipment manage this operation. The factory level controller (i.e., host) does not manage thehandoff operation. Figure 3 shows applications for the parallel I/O interface specified in this document.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Data for the material that is transferred (handed off) is managed through the equipments factory interface.Material management by the factory level controller is outside the scope of this document.

SEMI E84-0305 © SEMI 1999, 2005 2 3.2 This specification defines the signals used to select a load port. The physical correspondence of the parallel I/Ointerface to the load port is not defined in this document.3.3 Error recovery procedures may need operator assistance and/or proprietary procedures specific to theequipment. Therefore, error recovery procedures are not defined in this document.3.4 Signal time diagrams apply to only one parallel I/O interface.

The time diagrams of the loading and unloading operations in single handoff are shown in Figures 14 and15, respectively. The sequence shown in Figures 14 and 15 is:1) When the passive equipment (i.e., OHS) arrives at the active equipment (i.e., STOCKER), the passiveequipment specifies to the active equipment where the handoff will take place using VS\_0 and VS\_1.2) At the same time as VS\_set, the passive equipment turns the L\_REQ signal ON if the load port is ready toperform a loading operation or turns the U\_REQ signal ON if the load port is ready to perform an unloadingoperation.3) The passive equipment turns the VA signal ON. It shows that the signal transition of VS\_0 and VS\_1, L\_REQor U\_REQ is valid.4) After the active equipment recognizes the VA signal, it checks the VS\_0 and VS\_1, L\_REQ and U\_REQ signaland turns the TR\_REQ signal ON to request the passive equipment to start the carrier handoff operation.5) The passive equipment turns the READY signal ON when the passive equipment is ready for the handoff of thecarrier.6) After confirming the READY signal is ON, the active equipment turns the BUSY signal ON and starts thehandoff operation.7) The passive equipment turns the L\_REQ (U\_REQ) signal OFF when a carrier is placed correctly on the loadport (When the carrier on the load port is removed).

Simultaneous handoff is thehandoff operation in which active equipment transfers two carriers to two load ports simultaneously in a singletransfer operation. Some types of AMHS equipment are able to transfer two carriers simultaneously in a transferoperation. The capability can be applied to increase the performance of the transfer. For example, simultaneoushandoff can be applied to single arm/double hand AMHS equipment capable of transferring two carriers in a singletransfer operation.6.2.5.2 The time diagram of simultaneous handoff is shown in Figure 16. The figure shows only the load operation;however, L\_REQ may be changed to U\_REQ for the unload operation. The sequence of the simultaneous handoff isthe same as that of the single handoff except that the specification of the load port with CS\_0 and CS\_1 signals andthe definition of ON/OFF of the L\_REQ and U\_REQ signals are different. The following list describes the sequencewhich is different from Figures 12 and 13:1) The active equipment turns the signals CS\_0 and CS\_1 ON to inform the passive equipment it is simultaneoushandoff.2) The active equipment turns the VALID signal ON after the transition of CS\_0 and CS\_1 is effective.3) The passive equipment turns the L\_REQ (U\_REQ) signal ON when both carriers in the specified load ports(load ports of both CS\_0 and CS\_1) are ready to be loaded (unloaded).4) When both carriers are detected (removed) at the two load ports, the L\_REQ (U\_REQ) signal is turned OFF.6.2.5.3 This specification defines the capability to control simultaneous handoff. Simultaneous handoff is thehandoff operation in which active equipment transfers two carriers to two load ports simultaneously in a singletransfer operation. Some types of interbay AMHS equipment (i.e. stockers) are able to transfer two carrierssimultaneously in a transfer operation. The capability can be applied to increase the performance of the transfer. Forexample, simultaneous handoff can be applied to single arm/double hand AMHS equipment capable of transferringtwo carriers in a single transfer operation.6.2.5.3.1 The time diagram of simultaneous interbay handoff using a passive OHS vehicle is shown in Figure 15.The figure shows only the load operation, however L\_REQ may be changed to U\_REQ for the unload operation.The sequence of the simultaneous handoff is the same as that of the single handoff except that the specification of

SEMI E84-0305 © SEMI 1999, 2005 20 6.2.6 Continuous Handoff Sequence6.2.6.1 This specification defines the capability to control continuous handoff. Continuous handoff is the handoffoperation in which the active equipment transfers two or more carriers sequentially and continuously in a carriertransfer operation. Some types of AMHS equipment are able to handoff more than two carriers in a transferoperation. This capability can be applied to increase the performance of the transfer.6.2.6.2 When the passive equipment has a door in front of the load port, the door on passive equipment must beopened before the carrier handoff starts by the active equipment. It is redundant to open and close the door for acarrier handoff when two or more carriers are transferred. Therefore, the door shall be kept open during the carriertransfer operation. Continuous handoff is applied to the transfer operation to avoid redundant operations.6.2.6.3 Continuous handoff sequence for handoffs at a load port (Unload -&gt; Load): The example time diagram forcontinuous handoff is shown in Figure 18. This example shows the sequence of unload and load operationsperformed continuously at the load port. Each sequence in the continuous handoff is the combination of the singlehandoff sequence. In addition, the CONT signal is used to indicate a continuous handoff. In the sequence shown inFigure 10, the carrier on the load port is unloaded first, and a new carrier is loaded on the load port. The CONTsignal is turned ON at the time of active equipment BUSY ON of the first handoff to indicate that the handoff iscontinuous. In successive load sequences, the same load port number (CS\_0 in this example) is specified to use thesame load port. In this example, there are no more carriers that are to be transferred after the second load sequence,therefore the active equipment turns the CONT signal OFF when the BUSY signal is turned ON in the secondhandoff to indicate the continuous handoff is complete.6.2.6.4 Continuous handoff sequence for handoffs at different load ports (Load -&gt; Load): The example timediagram for continuous handoff on the different load ports is shown in Figure 19. In this example, the activeequipment first transfers a carrier to the load port corresponding to CS\_0, then another carrier is transferred to theload port corresponding to CS\_1. In this example, the sequence is the same as that of the continuous handoff(handoff at a load port: Unload -&gt; Load) shown in section above except for the specification of the load ports.

The HO\_AVBLsignal is ON during passive equipment normal operations and shall be turned OFF when the passive equipmentdetects an exception for the handoff. The active equipment is informed of the exception condition by the HO\_AVBLsignal. The HO\_AVBL signal may be turned OFF independently of the other SEMI E84 signals, prior to or duringthe handoff. The active equipment is expected to confirm the HO\_AVBL signal in the following periods:a) From the time at which the VALID signal is turned ON to the time at which the L\_REQ or U\_REQ signal isturned ON.b) From the time at which the TR\_REQ signal is turned ON to the time at which the READY signal is turnedON.6.2.7.2 Figures 20 through 23 are the time diagrams to explain situation a) in the section above and show examplesof potential HO\_AVBL signal activity. The active equipment stops the handoff when it detects that the HO\_AVBLsignal is turned OFF by the passive equipment. The active equipment turns the VALID signal OFF to close thehandshake (CS\_0 and CS\_1 signals must be set to OFF at this time). The passive equipment turns the HO\_AVBLsignal ON after the VALID signal is turned to OFF (L\_REQ or U\_REQ must be set to OFF).6.2.7.3 Figures 24 through 26 are the time diagrams to explain situation b) in the section above and show examplesof potential HO\_AVBL signal activity. The active equipment stops the handoff when it detects that the HO\_AVBLsignal is turned OFF by the passive equipment. The active equipment turns the VALID signal OFF to close thehandshake (CS\_0, CS\_1, and TR\_REQ signals must be set to OFF). The passive equipment turns the HO\_AVBLsignal ON after the VALID signal is turned to OFF (L\_REQ or U\_REQ must be set to OFF).6.2.8 Handoff Available Signal Operation Sequence (for interbay passive OHS and Stocker)6.2.8.1 Example time diagrams for the HO\_AVBL signal are shown in Figures 27 through 29. The HO\_AVBLsignal is ON during passive OHS normal operations and shall be turned OFF when the passive OHS detects anexception for the handoff. The active stocker is informed of the exception condition by the HO\_AVBL signal. The

The active stocker stops transferring when the active stocker detects that the HO\_AVBLsignal has been turned OFF by the passive OHS. By turning off the AM\_AVBL signal, the active Stocker closes thetransfer sequence. In such a case, the TR\_REQ signal must go OFF as the transfer sequence has ended. Also, thepassive OHS must turn OFF the VS\_0 and VS\_1 signals. Next, the passive OHS must turn ON the HO\_AVBLsignal after the VA signal has gone OFF (the L\_REQ or U\_REQ must be set OFF).

Table 8 shows the timeouts for the passive equipment.TAx (x is a number) represents the timer for the active equipment, and TPx (x is a number) represents the timer forthe passive equipment. The range for all timers (except TD0) shall be from 1 second to 999 seconds. All timersetpoints shall be user programmable.6.3.2.2 The delay timer specifies the delay time between VALID signals within one continuous sequence ofhandoffs. Specifically, it signifies the delay following the VALID signal turning OFF on the completion of the firsthandoff and the VALID signal turning ON at the start of the second handoff. The delay timer is required becausethe passive equipment may need a certain time margin to detect the second VALID signal transition to ON. Table 9shows the delay timer. All timer setpoints shall be user programmable.6.3.2.3 The recommended and optional delay timer TD0 defines the timing between CS\_0 or CS\_1 ON and VALIDON for the active equipment as shown in the signal time diagrams. In this way, the passive equipment can predict

Recovery procedures may require operatorassistance and/or proprietary procedures specific to the equipment. It is recommended that the recovery procedure(ex, abort interlock sequence and set to restart/complete) be provided on the active equipment and the passiveequipment.6.4 Connector Type, Signal, and Pin Assignment6.4.1 The connector type for the passive equipment side must be type DB-25 socket housing (female) as specifiedin ISO 2110:1989. The connector will have female 4-40 threaded jack screw locks. Suitable 25 pin connectorsknown as Type D are similar to Amphenol MIN RAC 17 series with jack screw locks. It is recommended that theconnector on the passive equipment should be appropriately labeled. As shown in Figure 30, this standard specifiesthe connector on the passive side optical PI/O for floor based vehicles (RGV, AGV, others) (case 1), as well as theactive to passive connector between an overhead delivery system and production equipment (case 2). Figure 31defines the PI/O point of interface for the interbay AMHS (OHS and stocker). If the OHS is the active device in theinterbay AMHS then the stocker is the passive device. Likewise, if the OHS is the passive device, then the stockeris the active device.

SEMI E84-0305 © SEMI 1999, 200535 APPENDIX 1APPLICATION NOTES NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI E84 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures onJuly 21, 2002. The recommendations in this appendix are optional and are not required to conform to this standard.Determination of the suitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user. A1-1 General Applications NotesA1-1.1 If the connection to the equipment for overhead delivery is made using an electrical connector, Figure A1-1defines a zone on the process or metrology equipment where the plug can be located. This zone is independent ofthe exclusion zones for parallel I/O devices defined by SEMI E15.1. The zones defined in SEMI E15.1 are designedto be used primarily for photo-coupled floor based delivery systems such as AGVs or RGVs, while the zone definedhere on the top of the passive equipment applies primarily to a plug for overhead communication. The plug shouldbe on the top or top edge of the equipment as shown and could be on either side of the bay/chase wall, depending onthe location of the wall. In some implementations, the wall may not exist.A1-1.2 During the first few sequences of the SEMI E84 protocol before the carrier transfer begins if an error occursthe active vehicle should send an error to the host which leads to an automatic recover without human intervention.The active vehicle, on its own or in response to a host-initiated signal, should automatically recover any SEMI E84error up to the BUSY ON state.A1-1.3 No application of parallel I/O communication can provide perfect isolation due to Electro-magneticradiation into and between parallel conductors. Precautions should be taken, by all equipment suppliers, includingbut not limited to insuring a minimum capacitance of signal lines to reduce susceptibility to noise introduced into theequipment.A1-1.4 There are two types of equipment, internal buffer equipment and fixed buffer equipment. Internal bufferequipment is equipment that uses locations other than load ports within the equipment to store carriers. Fixed bufferequipment is production equipment that has only fixed load ports and no internal buffer for carrier storage. Wafersare loaded and unloaded directly from the carrier at the load port for processing.A1-1.5 This standard specifies two different PI/O configurations, one PI/O per load port and one PI/O per two loadports (Figure A1-2). Carrier transfer throughput and efficiency is higher if more than one carrier is transferred at thesame time. Carrier transfer time is also reduced if the intrabay AMHS equipment can deliver two or more carriers atthe same time from one parked position. Typically internal buffer equipment that allows hand-off of two carriers totwo load ports either simultaneously or continuously can best take advantage of these throughput improvements.Thus, internal buffer equipment will require either one PI/O per load port (Figure A1-3, Concept A) or one PI/O pertwo load ports (Figure A1-3, Concept B), depending on the AMHS delivery system. Fixed buffer equipment willrequire one PI/O device per load port (Figure A1-4). Based on their production equipment and AMHS systems, endusers will specify the SEMI E84 concept (one PI/O per load port or one PI/O per two load ports) and location thatwill be required on the manufacturing equipment.A1-1.6 Figure 17 does not define a particular orientation of the PI/O interface sensor unit. Figure A1-5 shows howto orient the PI/O device for AGV/RGV of the exclusion volume in the load port. Refer to SEMI E15.1 fordescriptions of D7, D8, H7, H8, and W8.

Typical TTL circuits typically require a pull-down to 0.8 Vdc or less. For hard-wired connections, some TTL input circuits might not be able to sense an onstate between 0.8 Vdc and 1.8 Vdc. One possible implementation is to provide an input receiver circuit.

This functionality will support equipmentlevel testing of automated carrier transfers and SEMI E84 communications at load ports. A1-2 Reticle Loadport Connector LocationsA1-2.1 For equipment with reticle carrier loadports, if the connection for automated delivery to the equipment ismade using an electrical connector, the connector should be located on the top of the equipment outside of theeasement for overhead transport. The connector should be no more than 600 mm from the edge of the easement. A1-3 Additional Interbay AMHS InformationA1-3.1 This section describes error generation and recovery examples (mainly for active equipment) for interbayAMHS (i.e., OHS, stockers). The following are errors that could conceivably occur during transfer operations (load,unload). The procedures are designed for a technician with considerable knowledge of AMHS equipment. Errorrecovery should always follow the recovery procedures specified in the equipment manuals.A1-3.2 OHS (Active Type) Error ExamplesTable A1-1 Load Operation ErrorsNo. Error Description OHS Reaction 1 The L\_REQ does not go OFF in the allotted amount of time during aload transaction.2 Anytime during the transfer a load operation failure or stop positioningfailure is detected.

In the case of sequences 2 and 3 (above), the load/unload sequence should be started over from the beginning.A1-3.4 If the stocker is the active side of the interbay AMHS (i.e., OHS and stockers) it is conceivable that theloader will interfere with the OHS passing by the stocker in failure scenarios. As a result of this possibility, it isnecessary for interbay AMHS equipment makers to establish an OHS PASS OK signal separate from the SEMIE84 interlock. However, this note has no direct bearing on the contents of SEMI E84. Therefore, readers of SEMIE84 should only treat this as a reference item.Pass Interlock

A1-4 Errors and Automated RecoveryA1-4.1 This section describes recommendations for implementation of errors and the associated recoveryprocedures for Interbay OHS (Active Vehicle) and Intrabay OHT, definition of practical implementation of theHO\_AVBL and ES signals, and examples of various L\_REQ and U\_REQ sequences.NOTE 6: This application note assumes an SEMI E84 implementation where one parallel I/O device per loadport is used.A1-4.2 During the first few sequences of the SEMI E84 protocol before the carrier transfer begins if an error occursthe active vehicle should send an error to the host but automatically recover without human intervention. The activevehicle should automatically recover any SEMI E84 error up to the BUSY ON state.A1-4.3 Definition of Automated Recovery  If an error occurs the active vehicle should send an UnsuccessfulTransfer Complete command to the HOST, then the HOST will send the active vehicle an alternate location. SEMIE82 Intrabay SEM defines this recovery procedure in detail. Table A1-5 shows some specific scenarios where theactive vehicle should automatically recover.Table A1-5 Example Automatic Recover ScenariosNo. Error Description Active Equipment Reaction 1 TA1 Timeout: The active equipment sends the CS\_0, CS\_1 signal butdoes not receive the U\_REQ or L\_REQ signal.2 TA2 Timeout: The Active equipment sends the TR\_REQ signal butdoes not receive the READY signal.3 During the sequence HO\_AVBL signal goes low before BUSY turnson. Unsuccessful Transfer Complete is sent to theHost and automatically recovered on the Activeside (no human intervention). A1-4.4 HO\_AVBL SignalA1-4.4.1 The HO\_AVBL signal specifies if the Passive Equipment is available to accept a Load / Unload from theActive Equipment. The HO\_AVBL should also be used to identify situations where harm to the carrier or productmay exist. The HO\_AVBL signals are loadport specific and should not apply to all of the loadports on theequipment. Table A1-6 shows some specific scenarios for the HO\_AVBL Signal.Table A1-6 Example HO\_AVBL ScenariosNo. Description of Passive Equipment HO\_AVBL Signal Response1 Presence Sensor is ON but Placement sensor is OFF.#1 OFF2 Presence Sensor is OFF but Placement sensor is ON.#1 OFF3 Passive Equipment is in Manual Access Mode.

The ES Signal is not loadport specific but rather toolspecific. That means, for example, if an EMO is pressed on the Passive Equipment the ES signal should be OFF onall SEMI E84 loadports. Table A1-7 shows some specific scenarios for the ES Signal.Table A1-7 Example ES Signal ScenariosNo. Description ES Signal Response1 EMO button is pressed. OFF2 Interlocked maintenance door or interlocked panel on the PassiveEquipment is openedOFF 3 Carrier Handling Robot is in Error at the load port (internal bufferequipment or stocker)OFF A1-4.6 L\_REQ and U\_REQ SignalsA1-4.6.1 When the L\_REQ and U\_REQ signals are turned OFF they verify the completion of the Load/Unloadsequence as indicated by the presence/placement sensors on the load port.A1-4.6.1.1 Here are some practical examples of using these signals.1) During a Load both Presence and Placement sensors are ON once the carrier is detected. This should signal theL\_REQ signal to turn OFF. The L\_REQ signal should typically not turn OFF unless both the presence andplacement sensors are ON.2) When delivering, the Active Equipment should not release the FOUP until L\_REQ is OFF.3) During an Unload both Presence and Placement sensors are OFF once the carrier is not detected. This shouldsignal the U\_REQ signal to turn OFF. The U\_REQ signal should typically not turn OFF unless both the presenceand placement sensors are OFF.4) The L\_REQ and U\_REQ signals should turn off immediately after the presence and placement sensors haveturned ON (load) or OFF (unload). There should be no delay timer between the presence and placement sensorON/OFF and L\_REQ / U\_REQ OFF.5) During an Unload, once the active vehicle has fully gripped the FOUP, in most cases the vehicle should ignorethe response from the U\_REQ signal until completion of its move. For example, the OHT vehicle should not stop150 mm  300 mm above the loadport, check the status of U\_REQ and then complete its move. The OHT shouldfully complete its move, check U\_REQ and finish the E84 sequence. If the U\_REQ signal is still high after thecompletion of its move and the active vehicle can be certain the carrier is safely and securely contained aboard thevehicle, in some cases the vehicle should abort the E84 sequence and continue normally to its destination.A1-4.7 Error MessagesA1-4.7.1 Interlock timeouts are required to detect handoff sequence errors between the active and passiveequipment. When these timeouts occur, an error message shall be displayed to the user including the followinginformation: Timer Name, Timer Description, and current Timer setting. Some examples of error messages arelisted in Tables A1-8, A1-9, and A1-10.
