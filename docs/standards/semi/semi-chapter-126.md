STANDARD TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF IONIC
CONTAMINATION ON SEMICONDUCTOR LEADFRAMES (PROPOSED)
This test method was technically approved by the Global Assembly & Packaging Committee and is the direct
responsibility  of  the  Japanese  Packaging  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  Japanese  Regional
Standards Committee on July 23, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to be published
November 2004. Originally published in 1990.
NOTE 1:  Japan,  Europe,  and  US  task  forces  are  planning  to
develop  test  methods  which  will  address  the  different  levels
of ionic contamination on leadframes.
1  Scope

NOTICE:  Unless  otherwise  indicated,  all  documents
cited shall be the latest published versions.
3  Summary of Method
3. 1  Ionic contamination is extracted in water at > 95°C
for 30 ± 2 minutes. The contamination is quantitatively
analyzed by ion type using Ion Chromatography and the
result is presented as nanograms/unit area.
4  Significance
4. 1  Contamination   on   leadframes   can   contribute   to
semiconductor device reliability problems. This method
may  be  used  by  lead  frame  manufacturers  at  outgoing
inspection   and   by   users   at   incoming   inspection.
Correlation  of  device  reliability  with  contamination
levels   may   lead   to   improved   leadframe   cleaning
processes.

8. 1  The  leadframes  must  not  be  touched,  except  with
previously  cleaned  tweezers  or  double-layered  cotton
gloves with polyethylene outer gloves in order to avoid
additional contamination.
8. 2  The  sample  size  (i.e.,  the  number  of  frames  to  be
tested  in  this  destructive  test)  may  be  determined  by
agreement  between  the  customer  and  the  vendor.  The
recommended  sample  sizes  are  10–50  cm
2
for  testing
pads and 200–500 cm for the test of overall leadframes.
NOTE 4:  The surface area of the frame is calculated from the
leadframe  drawing,  and  includes  the  top,  bottom  and  side
surfaces.  It  is  important  that  user  and  supplier  agree  on  the
surface     area     calculation     for     any     given     leadframe
configuration.
9  Preparation of Standard — Solutions and
Chromatograph Calibration

)  are
made by dissolving 1.000 g of each ion into 1.000 liter
of  D.I.  water,  respectively.  The  stored  multi-ingredient
standard solutions shown in Table 2 are then made form
these    single-ingredient    standard    solutions    by    the
dilution method.
9. 1.2  Cation    and    anion    standard    solutions    for
calibration   are   made   by   diluting   the   stored   multi-
ingredient standard solutions as shown in Table 2.
9. 1.3  Store  the  multi-ingredient  standard  solution  and
the  calibration  solutions  in  the  correct  flasks  and  label
with the ion type and concentration.
NOTE 5:  New standard solutions for calibration are required
every 24 hours. Ensure that the flasks are cleaned with water
before refilling with a new solution.
9. 2  Calibration
9. 2.1  Set  up  the  chromatograph  and  regenerate  the
columns  according  to  the  manufacturer’s  instructions
(ASTM D 4327 provides further details).
9. 2.2  Run the eluent through the chromatograph until a
stable baseline chromatograph is obtained.
9. 2.3  Select the infection volume recommended by the
manufacturer  for  each  ion  type  and  inject  in  to  the
chromatograph. Record the chromatograph for each ion
type  (see  Figure  1),  and  make  the  calibration  curve  for
each ion (ion concentration versus peak height or area).
NOTE 6:  Peak  height  or  area  under  the  ion’s  characteristic
curve is proportional to the concentration.
10  Procedure — Bag Extraction Method
10. 1  Preparation of Extraction Bags
10. 1.1  Add     100     ml     of     DI     water     to     the
polypropylene/polyethylene   double   layered   bag   and
seal them with the hot bar bag sealer. The amount of air
in  the  bags  should  be  reduced  as  much  as  possible
before sealing.
NOTE 7:  Two bags are required for each test and must come
from the same manufacturing lot.
10. 1.2  Place the bags in the water bath at T > 95°C for
2 hours ± 5 minutes.
10. 1.3  Allow  the  bags  to  reach  room  temperature  but
leave  sealed  until  ready  for  use  at  which  time  open  the
bags (use clean scissors for the bags) and rinse out five
(5) times with DI water.
10. 2  Extraction Process
10. 2.1  Place the samples in the bags. Cover the frames
with  a  known  volume  of  water  (e.g.,  100  ml  and  then
seal the bags). Also, place a similar amount of water in
an empty bag and seal.
NOTE 8:  The amount of air in the bags should be reduced as
much  as  possible  before  sealing.  The  bags  that  only  contain
water  provide  the  background  contamination  of  the  bag.  Do
not  select  the  frames  or  remove  them  from  their  shipping
container  until  ready  to  test  the  surface  contamination.  The
recommended volume of water is 10–30 ml for the testing die
pads  only  and  100  ml  for  testing  complete  leadframes.  Lead
frames  should  be  bent  after  sealing  so  that  the  water  is  in
contact with all surfaces.


SEMI G52-90 © SEMI 1990, 2004 3
10. 2.2  Place the bags in the water bath at T > 95°C for
30 ± 2 minutes.
10. 2.3  Remove  the  bags  from  the  bath  and  allow  to
reach room temperature.
10. 2.4  The  lead  frames,  which  are  inside  the  sealed
bags,   are   moved   to   one   side   of   the   bags   without
opening  the  bags.  Then  the  solution  is  separated  from
leadframes  by  sealing  the  mean  portion  of  the  bags
without opening.
11  Procedure — Container Extraction Method
NOTE 9:  The  size  of  the  containers  to  be  used  depends  on
the   expected   volume   of   water   and   the   leadframes.   The
container  must  be  at  least  three-quarters  filled  with  the  water
and leadframes.
11. 1  Preparation of Extraction Vessels
11. 1.1  Fill  the  containers  with  DI  water  and  attach  the
caps. In order to reduce the amount of air in the vessel,
fill vessels to the amount of three-quarter.
NOTE 10:  Two containers are required for each test and must
come from the same manufacturing batch.
11. 1.2  Place  the  containers  in  the  water  bath  at  T  >
95°C for 2 hours ± 5 minutes.
11. 1.3  Remove  the  containers  from  the  bath  and  rinse
out five (5) times with DI water.
11. 2  Process
11. 2.1  Place   the   samples   in   one   of   the   containers
cleaned per Section 11.1.1.
NOTE 11:  Leadframes  may  be  cut  or  rolled  in  order  to  ease
loading to the container. Die pads may be tested separately, if
desired, by cutting from the leadframes.
11. 2.1.1  Add the required volume of DI water and cap
the  container.  Place  a  similar  amount  of  water  into  the
other cleaned container and attach the cap.
NOTE 12:  Do  not  select  the  frames  or  remove  them  from
their  shipping  container  until  ready  to  test  for  the  surface
contamination. Recommended volumes of water are 10–30 ml
for  testing  die  pads  only  and  100  ml  for  the  entire  leadframe
— samples must be covered by water.
11. 2.2  Place  the  containers  in  the  water  bath  at  T  >
95°C for 30 ± 2 minutes.
11. 2.3  Remove the containers from the bath and allow
to reach room temperature.
11. 2.4  Remove  the  leadframes  from  the  container  and
cap it again.
12  Measurements
12. 1  Prepare   the   chromatograph   for   operation   by
regenerating      the      columns      according      to      the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
12. 2  Run the eluent through the chromatograph until a
stable baseline calibration is established.
12. 3  Inject   the   recommended   sample   size   of   test
solution  into  the  chromatograph  and  record  the  ion
chromatogram.
12. 4  Repeat   for   all   the   samples   and   also   run   the
background sample.
NOTE 13:  The time from extraction to insertion of sample is
to be within eight hours.
12. 5  Sample  concentrations  are  determined  from  the
calibration curves for each ion type.
12. 6  The  surface  concentration  of  ionic  contaminants
for  each  ion  type  (SCIC)  is  given  by  the  following
equation:

SCIC (ng/cm
2
) =
(Sample conc. – Background conc.)
×
Extraction Volume (mL)
Leadframe Surface Area (cm
2
)
×
No. of Leadframes

NOTE 14:  Allowable  concentration  levels  are  to  be  agreed
between the user and supplier.

SPECIFICATION FOR DIMENSIONS AND TOLERANCES USED TO
MANUFACTURE MOLDED PLASTIC PACKAGES
1  Preface
This  document  is  a  guideline  for  ordering  the  tooling
required     to     manufacture     plastic     semiconductor
packages.    These    packages    include    the    following
JEDEC registered outlines:
Plastic Dual-in-Line Packages (PDIP)
Plastic Leaded Chip Carrier (PLCC)
Plastic Quad Flat Packages (PQFP)
Small  Outline  I.C.  Packages  (SOIC  —  Gull  Wing
and “J” lead)
Plastic TAB Quad Packages (PTAB)
NOTE 1: Package outlines registered with other organizations
such as EIAJ and non-registered outlines may use the criteria
in  this  document  by  choosing  the  outline  which  most  closely
resembles the particular package.
Packaging  engineers,  mold  manufactures,  and  end-of-
line  tool  makers  may  use  this  document  to  define  the
limits of tooling tolerances.

Y14.5 — Dimensioning and Tolerancing
3  Selected Definitions
3. 1  Cavity — the plastic body form ed by either the top
or bottom mold cavities.
3. 2   Gate  Feature  —  plastic  protru sions  or  intrusions
which   result   from   normal   molding   and   degating
operations.
3. 3   Lead  Bend  Angle  —  the  angle   to  which  the  leads
are bent in reference to a plane normal to the X-Y plane
of the package. After a suitable radius has been formed
at  the  shoulder,  there  must  be  no  compound  angle
formation to achieve the lead spread requirements. Lead
Bend  Angle  may  just  be  a  reference  if  Lead  Spread  is
specified (see Figures 1A, B, C).
3. 4  Lead Coplanarity — the vertic al position of a lead
foot  with  respect  to  a  reference  plane  created  by  the
three  leads  with  feet  most  extended  from  the  bottom
surface of the package body. The term “foot” applies to
both PLCC foot radii and PQFP feet (see Figure 2).
3. 5   Lead  Shoulder  (Dambar  Area)   Protrusions  or
Intrusions — a protrusion (tab) on the shoulder or lead,
or  intrusion  cut  into  the  shoulder  or  lead  as  a  result  of
dambar trimming (see Figures 3 and 4).
3. 6   Lead  Sweep  —  lead  movemen t  measured  with
respect  to  a  datum,  perpendicular  to  the  top  or  bottom
surface  of  the  package  and  which  passes  through  the
midpoint of the lead, when viewed from the sides of the
package (see Figure 4).
3. 7   Mismatch  —  misalignment  be tween  the  top  and
bottom cavities. The measurement of mismatch is stated
as the difference between the center lines of the top and
bottom cavities (see Figure 5). All statements regarding
mismatch of cavities are applicable to both the X and Y
axis. All measurements are made prior to lead trim and
form.
3. 8   Offset  —  the  difference  in  the   bottom  cavity
position  from  a  leadframe  datum  when  compared  to
design   (see   Figure   6).   This   measurement   ignores
leadframe  tolerances.  All  statements  regarding  offset
are   applicable   to   both   the   X   and   Y   axis.   All
measurements are made prior to lead trim and form.

NY 10018

SEMI G54-93 © SEMI 19932
3. 9   Overlap  —  the  difference  in  le ngth  or  width
between the top and bottom cavities. Overlap may be a
feature  designed  into  the  mold  to  avoid  mismatch  (see
Figure  5).  All  statements  regarding  overlap  of  cavities
are   applicable   to   both   the   X   and   Y   axis.   All
measurements are made prior to lead trim and form.
3. 10 Package   Warpage   —   loss   of   pl anarity   of   a
molded  surface  excluding  protrusions  and  intrusions
(see  Figure  7).  Each  package  type  has  a  maximum
allowable   warpage   and   a   warp   factor   is   used   to
determine   the   maximum   warpage   for   a   particular
package  dimension.  The  Warp  Factor  (WF)  is  defined
as follows:
WF =
Total Warp in inches (mm
)×1000
Package dimension in inches (mm)
Package   warpage   is   usually   caused   by   incorrect
package design and/or poor molding conditions.
3. 11
Parting Line Protrusions, or In trusions — plastic
excesses (flash) or losses (chips or voids) at the parting
line after normal processing to mold, deflash, trim, and
singulate the packages.
3. 12
Surface   Protrusions   or   Intrusi ons   —   plastic
excesses  (bumps  or  blisters)  or  recesses  (pits  or  voids)
on any surface of the package.

TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING
BRIGHTNESS
This  test  method  was  technically  reapproved  by  the  Global  Assembly  &  Packaging  Committee  and  is  the
direct  responsibility  of  the  Japanese  Packaging  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  Japanese
Regional Standards Committee on July 23, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to be
published November 2004. Originally published in 1993.
1  Preface
1. 1  Use  —  This  test  may  be  used  for  process  control
and  outgoing  inspection  at  the  supplier  or  by  the  user
for incoming inspection.
2  Scope
2. 1    This  method  describes  the  standard  method  for
measuring    the    brightness    of    silver    plating    on
semiconductor leadframes.
NOTE 1:  This   method   determines   quantitative   measures
which are not related directly to the traditional “Dull,” “Semi-
Bright” and “Bright” descriptors for silver plating.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish

4  Significance
4. 1    Brightness  values  indicate  surface  roughness  for
given  plating  conditions.  Surface  roughness  affects  the
wettability    of    resinous    die    attach    processes    on
leadframes.  If  the  surface  is  too  smooth,  poor  wetting
may  occur  which  results  in  low  die  share  strength
values.
4. 2    Brightness  variations  may  also  affect  the  ability  of
the   pattern   recognition   systems   used   on   assembly
equipment to recognize the set points.
5  Summary of Method
5. 1      The   method   is   based   on   the   use   of   a   GAM
Densitometer.  This  method  is  chosen  as  the  standard
because  of  the  small  measurement  area  requirements
and  the  high  accuracy  of  the  method  for  typical  silver
plating brightness used on leadframes.
5. 1.1    This  method  is  based  on  the  measurement  of  the
reflectance  of  light  at  45°  from  a  surface  illuminated
from  a  light  source  perpendicular  to  the  surface.  This
value  of  Reflectance  (R)  gives  a  Density  Value  (D)
based on the following formula:
D = log 1/R
Density is a measure of the Brightness.

6  Interferences
6. 1  Surface Finish
6. 1.1    Brightness  values  depend  on  surface  roughness.
A  rough  surface  shows  a  low  brightness  value  when
compared   to   a   smooth   surface.   Variable   plating
conditions,  such  as  the  addition  of  brighteners  to  the
plating solution, may give brightness results, which are
not comparable for the acceptance of plated leadframes.
6. 1.2    Scratches  and  other  flaws  in  the  surface  will
affect reflectance.
6. 2  Storage Time and Conditions
6. 2.1        Figure    1    shows    the    brightness    results    for
leadframes subjected to indoor, atmospheric storage for



SEMI G55-93 © SEMI 1993, 2004 2
an  extended  time.  Results  are  shown  for  silver  plating
on copper alloy and Alloy 42 leadframes.
6. 2.2    Leadframes  shall  be  stored  in  conditions  agreed
between   supplier   and   customer   in   order   to   limit
atmospheric  tarnishing,  and  brightness  measurements
shall be taken within an agreed time of delivery.
6. 3  Degradation of the standards will affect calibration.
7  Equipment
7. 1  GAM Densitometer or equivalent.
8  Sampling
8. 1    A  sampling  plan  shall  be  agreed  between  user  and

TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING
THICKNESS
This  test  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Assembly  and  Packaging  Committee  and  is  the
direct  responsibility  of  the  Japanese  Assembly  and  Packaging  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the
Japanese  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  November  26,  2001.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org
December 2001; to be published March 2002.  Originally published in 1993.
1  Purpose
1. 1  Use  —  This  test  may  be  used  for  process  control
and   outgoing   inspection   at   the   supplier   or   by   the
customer for incoming inspection.
1. 2  Units — This standard test method uses SI units.
2  Scope
2. 1    This  method  describes  the  standard  method  for
measuring    the    thickness    of    silver    plating    on
semiconductor leadframes.
2. 2    This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.

ASTM B 568 — Measurement of Coating Thickness by
X-Ray Spectrometry
4  Significance
4. 1  The thickness of plating affects assembly processes
such  as  wire  bonding.  If  the  plating  is  too  thin,  heat
processes   such   as   die   attach   cause   the   surface   to
become   unbondable   due   to   bleeding   of   the   base
material through the plating.
4. 2    Schematic  picture  for  measurement  principles  is
shown in Figure 2.
5  Summary of Method
5. 1    The  method  is  based  on  the  use  of  fluorescent  X-
rays.  This  method  is  chosen  as  the  standard  because  of
the   small   measurement   area   requirements,   the   high
accuracy   of   the   method   for   typical   silver   plating
thicknesses  used  on  leadframes,  and  the  non-contact
method.

3  Selected Definitions
3. 1    blister   (bubble)   metallization   —    an   enclosed
locallized  separation  of  the  metallization  from  its  base
material (such as ceramic or another metallization layer
component) that does not expose the underlying layer.
3. 2  burr — an adherent fragment o f parent material at
a component edge. In leadframes, the metal burr, due to
the  stamping  operation,  may  be  in  the  horizontal  or
vertical  direction  to  the  surface.  In  ceramic  packages,
this type of characteristic is called a fin.
3. 3   camber  (ceramic)  —  arching  o f  a  nominally  flat
ceramic body.
3. 4    chip   —   region   of   material   mis sing   from   a
component  (e.g.,  ceramic  from  a  package,  or  solder
from   a   preform).   The   region   does   not   progress
completely  through  the  component  and  is  formed  after
the component is manufactured. Chip size is defined by
its  length,  width  and  depth  from  a  projection  of  the
design planform. Also called chipout. (See Figure 1.)
3. 5  crack — a cleavage or fracture  that extends to the
surface  of  a  semiconductor  package  or  solder  preform.
The  crack  may  or  may  not  pass  through  the  entire
thickness of the package or preform.
3. 6   critical  seal  area — on a semi conductor package,
the   area   bounded   by   the   shortest   nominal   design
distance  from  the  largest  cavity,  usually  the  wire  bond
cavity,  to  the  edge  of  the  package  or  ceramic  layer
forming the seal area. (See Figure 2.)
3. 7    fin   —   on   a   ceramic   package   or    cap,   a   fine
feathery-edged projection of parent ceramic material on
the corner of the ceramic body.

SEMI G58-94 © SEMI 19942
3. 8  foreign material — an adheren t particle that is not
parent  material  of  the  component.  Adherence  means
that the particle cannot be removed by an air or nitrogen
blast at 20 psi.
3. 9  glass flow — on a semiconduc tor package or cap,
the  heating  process  which  just  removes  all  the  screen
printing  mesh  marks  in  the  sealing  glass  when  viewed
at 10× magnification.
3. 10  glass void — the absence of a  sealing glass layer
from a designated area.
3. 11   metallization  void  —  the  absen ce  of  a  clad,
evaporated,   plated   or   screen-printed   metal   layer   or
braze from a designated area.
3. 12   non-critical  seal  area  —  on  a   semiconductor
package that uses a lid, cap, or cover to effect the seal,
the   area   of   the   sealing   surface   outside   the   critical
sealing area. (See Figure 2.)
3. 13   overhang  —  on  a  semiconduct or  package,  the
horizontal   extension   of   the   sealing   glass   past   the
vertical  wall  of  a  cavity  cut  into  the  ceramic  layer  on
which the glass is printed. (See Figure 3.)
3. 14   peeling  (flaking)  —  any  separa tion  of  a  plated,
vacuum  deposited,  or  clad  metal  layer  from  the  base
metal of a leadframe, pin, heatsink, or seal ring, from an
underplate,  or  from  a  refractory  metal  on  a  ceramic
package.  Peeling exposes the underlying metal.
3. 15    projection   —   on   a   semiconduc tor   package
(plastic    or    ceramic),    leadframe    or    preform,    and
irregularly raised portion of a surface indiginous to the

5  Summary of Method
Ionic  contamination  is  extracted  in  water  at  >  95∞C  for
30  ±  2  minutes.  The  contamination  is  quantitatively
analyzed by ion type using ion chromatography, and the
result is presented as nanograms/unit area.
6  Significance
6. 1    Contamination  on  the  interleaf  may  contribute  to
semiconductor     device     reliability     problems     by
transference of the contamination to the leadframes.
6. 2          The     method     may     be     used     by     leadframe
manufacturers   for   the   incoming   inspection   of   the
interleafing material, or by users at incoming inspection
of the leadframes.
6. 3        Correlation    of    device    reliability    results    with
interleaf contamination level measurements may lead to
improved interleaf materials.
7  Interferences
7. 1  The interleaf material and the leadframes must only
be  touched  with  cleaned  tweezers  or  while  wearing
double-layer  gloves  with  polyethylene  outer  gloves  in
order to avoid additional contamination.

11. 4  Mount the 127 mm × 76.2 mm × 3.2 mm (5" × 3"
×  1/8")  aluminum  panel  between  the  electrodes  in  the
electrostatic test unit so that the detector head is directly
over the center of the panel. Tighten the four wing nuts
to secure the panel.
11. 5    Set  the  recorder  chart  speed  to  25.4  mm/min.
(1"/min.).
11. 6  Set “OPERATION” switch to “OPERATE”.
11. 7    Turn  the  three-position  control  switch  to  “HIGH
VOLTAGE”.
11. 8  Verify that the reading on the recorder is identical
to the meter reading.  Adjust the recorder as necessary.
11. 9    Turn  the  three-position  switch  to  “GROUND”  to
remove the charge from the test panel.
11. 10    When  the  electrometer  meter  reaches  “ZERO”,
stop  the  recorder  and  set  the  “OPERATE”  switch  to
“ZERO CHECK”.
11. 11    Repeat  the  calibration  for  a  high  voltage  5KV
negative output.
12  Measurements and Calculations
12. 1      Mount   the   specimens   vertically   between   the
electrodes  and  tighten  the  wing  nuts  to  insure  intimate
contact between specimen and the electrodes.
12. 2  Set chart recorder to 12.7 mm/sec. (0.5"/sec.) and
turn on recorder.
12. 3        Set    electrometer    meter    switch    to    indicate
“POSITIVE”  or  “NEGATIVE”  charge  depending  on
the high voltage to be applied.
12. 4      Adjust   the   high   voltage   to   5KV   positive   or
negative as desired.
12. 5  Set “OPERATION” switch to “OPERATE”.
12. 6    Turn  the  three-position  control  switch  to  “HIGH
VOLTAGE”.
12. 7  When the meter reaches a peak, indicating that the
specimen  has  received  its  maximum  charge,  turn  the
three-position switch to “GROUND”.
12. 8    When  the  meter  needle  reaches  “ZERO”  or  after
10  seconds  which  ever  comes  first,  stop  the  recorder
and  move  the  “OPERATION”  switch  to  “GROUND
CHECK”.
12. 9    Charge  each  specimen  three  (3)  times  with  both
positive  and  negative  charges.    Allow  the  specimens  to
remain  grounded  for  10  minutes  after  each  charging
cycle to remove any residual charge on the specimen.
NOTE  4:  If  the  interleaf  material  is  non-homogenous,  both
surface   shall   be   charged   by   reversing   the   faces   of   the
specimen in contact with the electrodes.
12. 10        Calculate    the    decay    time,    in    seconds,    by
measuring the horizontal distance on the chart from the
point  where  the  specimen  was  grounded  until  the  point
