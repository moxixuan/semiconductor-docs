Two adjacent sidescontain marks in every cell: these are used primarily todefine physical size, orientation and symbol distortion.This is often referred to as the L finder pattern. Thetwo opposite sides are made up of cells containingmarks in alternate cells (see Figure 1).5.1.12 grayscale value the assignm ent of a digitalvalue to a degree of light intensity. The shades of grayare used by a computer to reconstruct an image. Acommon scale is 256 shades of gray, with 0 being blackand 255 being white.5.1.13 histogram  a graphic represe ntation of afrequency distribution of pixel values within an area ofinterest in a two-dimensional grayscale digital image.The horizontal axis of the graph represents the range ofpossible grayscale values in the image. The verticalaxis of the graph represents the frequency of occurrenceof each grayscale value in the area of interest (seeFigure 2).5.1.14 image coordinates location s in a two-dimensional digital image are referenced by a two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system. The datumfor the coordinate system is in the upper-left corner ofthe image. The horizontal axis or x-axis is located alongthe top of the image, with increasing positive values from left to right in the image. The vertical axis or y-axis is located along the left side of the image, withincreasing positive values from top to bottom in theimage.5.1.15 mark  a cell or area of a Dat a Matrix symbol,which has been marked, meaning the substrate has beenaltered by the marking process so as to significantlyalter its contrast when imaged. Also can refer to anentire Data Matrix symbol that has been applied in rowsand columns on a substrate by a marking process.5.1.16 pixels  picture elements. In a two-dimensional digital image, pixels are individualelements to which a grayscale value is associated.

Individual applications maydictate a specific wavelength or color temperature andspatial construction of illumination, image resolution,optical focus, image exposure, etc. The mark/readerconfiguration shall be consistent to the extent thatrepeatable results can be obtained from a single sampleover many instances of one mark/reader configuration. 6.1.2 The intent of the assessment p rocedure is toregard a test image from the actual mark/readerconfiguration as the source for all assessment.Therefore, the assessment criteria and the algorithmsused to carry out each assessment should be resident inthe actual reading system or equivalent that is used toread the mark. If a separate assessment or verificationsystem, which has different illumination characteristics,resolution, etc., is used, uncorrelated results may occur.6.2 Edge Detection Method6.2.1 Many of the assessment proce dures dependsignificantly on the type of edge detection method thatis employed to locate edges in the test image whichdefine the bounds of the entire Data Matrix symbol aswell as individual cells within the matrix. The edgedetection method used should be consistent throughoutthe assessment process.

SEMI T10-0701 © SEMI 2001 4 7 Procedure7.1 Location and Orientation of th e Data MatrixSymbol7.1.1 Data Matrix Location Descrip tors7.1.1.1 The implementation of the sym bol qualityassessment depends on knowledge of the location andorientation of the Data Matrix symbol in the image,which consists of the 4 image coordinate values of thematrix corner points, P1, P2, P3, and P4 (see Figure 3).In addition, the number of rows M and the number ofcolumns N in the Data Matrix symbol is also required(see Figure 3). Determine the image coordinate valuesand the number of rows and columns using a pre-processing decoding procedure resident in the readingsystem. Should this process either fail or not beavailable, determine these values by inspection of thetest image. Report the coordinate values of each matrixcorner point and the number of rows and columns.7.1.2 The Data Matrix Grid7.1.2.1 Based on the location of the 4 matrix cornerpoints and the number of rows and columns in thematrix establish a geometrical 2 dimensional matrixgrid. Establish line segment P1P2 using points P1 andP2, line segment P2P3 using P2 and P3, line segmentP3P4 using P3 and P4, and finally line segment P1P4, using P4 and P1. Divide the number of rows M into theP1P2 line segment, producing M equally sized linesegments. Divide the number of rows M into the P3P4line segment producing a similar result. Divide thenumber of columns N into P1P4 line segment,producing N equal sized line segments. Divide thenumber of columns N into the P2P3 line segment,producing a similar result. Connect the correspondingnew line segment endpoints between P1P2 and P3P4.Connect the corresponding new line segment endpointsbetween P1P4 and P2P3. This results in a 2dimensional matrix grid similar to that shown in Figure3. This grid is generally quadrilateral in shape,practically rectangular and ideally square.7.1.3 Data Matrix Cell Center Point s7.1.3.1 Determine the ideal geometric al center pointsin each matrix cell in the following manner. Establish anew set of points at the bisection of each row andcolumn line segment used to form the matrix grid.Form line segments between each corresponding rowbisection point in P1P2 and P3P4. Do the same for thecolumn bisection points in P1P4 and P2P3. Theintersection points between this new set of lines in eachmatrix cell is the ideal geometrical matrix cell centerpoint (see Figure 4).

SEMI T10-0701 © SEMI 20015 Figure 4Matrix Cell Center Locations 7.2 Symbol Contrast7.2.1 Symbol Contrast measures the distinctiveness ofthe two reflective states in the symbol, namely light anddark. Many aspects of the mark/reader configurationaffect the resulting symbol contrast in the image.7.2.2 Within the grayscale image, se lect all of theimage pixels, which fall within the area of the symbol,extending outward to the limits of any required quietzones. Sort the selected pixels by their reflectancevalues into a histogram. Calculate the arithmetic meanof the reflectance histogram. Use this mean value toseparate the reflectance histogram into 2 sections orsub-histograms, which represent approximatereflectance histograms for the dark and light contrastsof the symbol. Calculate the arithmetic mean of eachsub-histogram. The lower grayscale value of the twomeans represents the dark grayscale value G D and thehigher value represents the light grayscale value G L.Use these two grayscale values to calculate a newsymbol contrast. The difference of the grayscale levelsdivided by the full range of grayscale (255 in the caseof 8 bit A/D Sampling) is the Symbol Contrast. Reportthe Symbol Contrast value. 100%Range(255)GrayscaleDGLGSC = (1) 7.3 Symbol Contrast Signal to Noi se Ratio (SNR)7.3.1 The Symbol Contrast Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR) is a relative measure of the symbol contrast(signal) to the maximum deviation in the light or darkgrayscale level in the symbol (noise). Using the sub-histograms and the two grayscale values GL and GDfound in the Symbol Contrast calculation, calculate thedeviation of each sub-histogram about each respectivegrayscale value. Two values will result: the deviationof light pixels D L and the deviation of dark pixels DD .Calculate a symbol contrast difference in grayscalevalue using the grayscale values. Divide this contrastdifference by the maximum deviation calculated for theindividual light and dark sections of the histogram.This ratio is the Symbol Contrast SNR. Report thesymbol contrast SNR.

SEMI T10-0701 © SEMI 2001 6 7.4 Mark Growth7.4.1 Mark Growth is concerned wit h tracking thetendency of a marking system to over or under mark thesymbol. This is a size comparison between the actualmarked cells vs. their nominal size. Changes in markgrowth can be indicative of changes in the markingprocess or substrate characteristics or changes in thereader configuration, such as illumination or opticalfocus.7.4.2 Within the grayscale image, ba sed upon thematrix coordinates and the number of rows andcolumns in the matrix, determine a scanline of pixelswhich bisects the horizontal alternating pattern anddetermine a scanline which bisects the verticalalternating pattern of the matrix (Figure 3). Scan alongeach alternating pattern, generating a cross-sectionalgrayscale profile of each alternating pattern as shown inFigure 5. Determine the location of each edge withinthe alternating patterns locally, using an appropriateedge detection method. Based upon the edge locations,compute the width of each matrix cell in the horizontalalternating pattern in the direction of the horizontalscanline. Also, compute the height of each matrix cellin the vertical alternating pattern in the direction of thevertical scanline. Separate the mark and space cellwidths and compute the median space cell width (SCW)and the median mark cell width (MCW). HorizontalMark Growth (HMG) is computed as: 100%(SCW)Med(MCW)MedMCW)(MedHMG += (3) Separate the mark and space cell heights and computethe median space cell height (SCH) and the medianmark cell height (MCH). Vertical Mark Growth(VMG) is computed as: 100%Med(SCH)Med(MCH)Med(MCH)VMG += (4) Report the Horizontal Mark Growth and Vertical MarkGrowth values.7.5 Data Matrix Cell Size7.5.1 The Data Matrix Cell Size exp resses the averagesize of each cell in the matrix in pixels and is composedof a width and height component. Compute the CellSize using the distances between corner points and theknown number of rows M and the known number ofcolumns N in the matrix (referring to Figure 3).7.5.2 Data Matrix Cell Width7.5.2.1 Compute the Data Matrix Cell Width(DMCW) using the distance between P1 and P4,dist(P1, P4), the distance between P2 and P3, dist(P2,P3) and the number of columns N as follows: N2P3)(P2,distP4)(P1,distDMCW += (5) Report the Data Matrix Cell Width.

The Mark Misplacement ismeasured separately in horizontal and verticaldirections relative to the average width of the marks inthe respective direction.7.6.2 Using the mark cell horizontal and vertical edgelocations, as determined in Section 7.4.2, compute theimage coordinate of the midpoint between the edges ofeach mark in the corresponding horizontal and verticaldirections. In the horizontal direction, for each markcalculate its misplacement MHi as the distance betweenthe detected midpoint and its ideal cell center point.

SEMI T11-0703 © SEMI 2002, 2003 6 RELATED INFORMATION 1OTHER CONSIDERATIONS NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI T11. It was derived from task force discussionsand is provided for reference and information only. This related information was approved for publication by fullletter ballot on August 29, 2002. R1-1 Other ConsiderationsR1-1.1 This specification defines only the location ofthe ID mark on the reticle surface. However, issuesrelating to substrate edge length tolerances, pellicles,reticle positioning, robotic end effectors and alignmentmarks were considered in development of thespecification. These are summarized below and inFigure R1-1.R1-1.2 Substrate Edge Length  Table 1 of SEMI P1specifies that edge length for 6 reticle substrates shallbe ≥ 151.6 mm and ≤ 152.4 mm. Figure 2 representsthis as 152.0 ± 0.4 mm.R1-1.3 Pellicles  It is assumed that the pellicle is asquare with a nominal size of 124 mm that is centeredon the mask substrate. A pellicle misalignmentallowance of ± 0.5 mm has been suggested by reticlesuppliers and users; this is reflected in Figure 3. Anunpatterened chrome film is specified between the quietzone and pellicle frame to eliminate influence on thereader of light scattered from the pellicle frame whenmark reading illumination and the reader camera are onopposite sides of the reticle as shown in Figure R1-1. Effector End Illuminator CCDCamera Symbol PellicleReticle Controller &Decoder Figure R1-1Example of Top-Side ID Illumination with Pattern-Side Reader and End Effector R1-1.4 Reticle Positioning  Misalignment in a toolcan result from several factors, e.g. position in thecassette, position on the end effector, substratesquareness and others. A reticle misaligment allowanceof ± 1.5 mm has been suggested by stepper and othertool suppliers and users. This is reflected in Figure 3.R1-1.5 Robotic End Effectors  End effector grips aretypically ≤ 6.0 mm wide, in the reticle contact area. A6.0 mm end effector width is shown in Figure 3.

SEMI T12-0305 © SEMI 2004, 20051 SEMI T12-0305SPECIFICATION FOR TRACING JIGS AND IMPLEMENTS This specification was technically approved by the Global Traceability Committee and is the directresponsibility of the Japanese Traceability Committee. Current edition approved by the Japanese RegionalStandards Committee on November 24, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org January 2005; to bepublished March 2005. Originally published in 2004; previously published July 2004. 1 Purpose1.1 Semiconductor production equipment may use jigs and/or implements to produce semiconductor devices. Somecase such important conditions as quality of products and tool performance may depend on jigs or implements. Thisdifference often comes from such historical events as processing cycles, processing products, stocking environment.To make sure correlation between the conditions and the events tracing jigs and implements is required.1.2 Purpose of this document is to establish concept to trace jigs and/or implements used on equipment forprocessing material and make sure required information, communications and services to realize the concept. 2 Scope2.1 Scope of this specification includes management of required information on equipment. Because a specificpiece of jig may be used on other equipment, usually same type and/or same supplier, information transfer betweenequipment and factory host computer is also in the scope of this specification.2.2 Such physical issues mark position and mark readers are out of scope, for this specification treats just tracinginformation, communication of it and logical management. The physical specification may be standardizedseparately.2.3 As long as management on this specification and above requirement is expected on an equipment, theequipment is in the scope regardless of the type of process or type of equipment.2.4 But if jigs and/or implements for certain type of equipment have been already traced or managed complyingwith existing standard or along with some specification conventionally, they are out of scope of this specification.But this specification can be applied even to such jigs and tools if user and/or suppliers want.2.5 Because this specification describes just base functionalities to realize the traceability, applications of thefunctionalities including checking or management of counterfeits are out of scope.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This specification defines and makes sure concept and information transfer basics. Specification about physicalID marking on jigs and tools including readers/writers, and such application of this tracking as security andoperations are dependent to standard users. They are responsible for their application and related regal issues. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E5  SEMI Equipment Communications Standard 2 Message Content (SECS-II)SEMI E30  Generic Model for Communications and Control of Manufacturing Equipment (GEM)SEMI E39  Object Service Standard: Concepts, Behavior, and ServicesNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.

Accordingly, notation isbased on Unified Modeling Language (UML).6.2.1 Formal Name of an Object  The text capitalizes formal object name references. Similar to the waycapitalization is normally used when discussing entities. When describing something in the general (like cities)lower case is used, but when a specific entity is of interest (New York City), then first letters are capitalized.6.2.2 Components of Complex Attributes  The names of object attributes defined in tables are left-justified. Theindividual elements of complex attributes are right-justified in order of appearance below the complex attribute.6.3 State Model Conventions6.3.1 This document uses the Harel state chart convention for describing dynamic operation of defined objects. Theoutline of this convention is described in an attachment of SEMI E30. The official definition of this convention isdescribed in State charts: A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems1.6.3.2 The Harel convention has not the concept of state models of creation and extinction for expressing atemporary entity. The Secondent described in this document is such an entity, and a copy of the same state model isused for an independent job newly created. In this document, a circle with a black circle inside is used forexpressing extinction of an entity. A filled black circle denotes the entry to the state model (the entity creation).6.3.3 Transition tables are provided in conjunction with the state diagrams to explicitly describe the nature of eachstate transition. A transition table contains columns for Transition number, Previous State, Trigger, New State,Actions, and Comments. The trigger (column 3) for the transition occurs while in the previous state. Theactions (column 5) includes a combination of:1. Actions taken upon exit of the previous state.2. Actions taken upon entry of the new state.3. Actions taken which are most closely associated with the transition.4. No differentiation is made between these cases. Num Previous State Trigger New State Actions Comments 6.4 Service Message Representation  Services are functions or methods that may be provided by either theequipment or the host. A service message may be either a request message, which always requires a response, or anotification message, that does not require a response. 1 D. Harel, State charts: A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems, Science of Computer Programming 8, 1987.

SEMI T12-0305 © SEMI 2004, 20053 6.4.1 Service Definition6.4.1.1 A service definition table defines the specific set of messages for a given service resource, as shown in thefollowing table: Message Service Name Type Description 6.4.1.2 Type can be either N = Notification or R = Request & Response.6.4.1.3 Notification type messages are initiated by the service provider (e.g., the equipment) and the provider doesnot expect to get a response from the service user. Request messages are initiated by a service user (e.g., the host).Request messages ask for data or an activity from the provider. Request messages expect a specific responsemessage (no presumption on the message content).6.4.2 Service Parameter Dictionary6.4.2.1 A service parameter dictionary table defines the description, format and its possible value for parametersused by services, as shown in the following table: Parameter Name Description Format: Possible Value 6.4.2.2 A row is provided in the table for each parameter of a service.6.4.3 Service Message Definition6.4.3.1 A service message definition table defines the parameters used in a service, as shown in the following table: Parameter Req/Ind Res/Cnf Comment 6.4.3.2 The columns labeled REQ/IND and RSP/CNF link the parameters to the direction of the message. Themessage sent by the initiator is called the Request. The receiver terms this message the Indication or therequest. The receiver may then send a Response which the original sender terms the Confirmation.6.4.3.3 The following codes appear in the REQ/IND and RSP/CNF columns and are used in the definition of theparameters (eg., how each parameter is used in each direction): M Mandatory Parameter  Must be given a valid value.C Conditional Parameter  May be defined in some circumstances and undefined in others. Whether a value isgiven may be completely optional or may depend on the value of the other parameter.U User-Defined Parameter.- The parameter is not used.= (For response only.) Indicates that the value of this parameter in the response must match that in the primary (ifdefined). 7 General Requirements7.1 Identification Means  Equipment has to have any means to identify physical Jigs and/or Implements.7.2 Communication Means  Each equipment and managing system has to have any electric communicationmeans to transact.

SEMI T12-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 4 8 Overview8.1 Attachments in Semiconductor Manufacturing  A semiconductor production line consists of many amountpieces of equipment with many types. Some types of equipment require such attachments as jigs and/or implementsto manufacture semiconductor devices. Because some of them act very important roles, quality, yield orproductivity of process may depend on them and their management.8.2 Management of Attachments  Management is required on specific attachments to have better product quality,yield and productivity. This document specifies definitions, concepts, behavior and services to manage attachmentson equipments and also in factory. However not all the attachments require such management and specification ofthis document should be applied to restricted ones especially to the ones used for important processes, sensitive andincompatible combinations between Attachments and equipment.8.3 Effective Concepts for a Variety of Attachments  There are many kinds of equipment types and also a varietyof attachments. To be effective to almost all of them, specification of this document is generic and idealized withoutany physical limitations or practical details. It is also important to be independent to rapidly changing technologiesand production environment.8.4 Logical and Informational Specification  To keep track of conceptual document and keep shared area as wideas possible, this document specifies just logical and informational issues, except related information part. Physicalspecifications are assumed to be defined as separated documents; they may be specified in other standards, proprietyspecifications or mixed together.8.5 Tracking Oriented Management  Because there may be very specific managements or operation for strategyin factories and they may not be shared by many fabs, strategic management for specific factory or products may notbe better to be standardized. Most parts of the management specified in this document are related to traceability. Inother words tracking of Jigs and Implements is the standardized area of management of Attachments in thisdocument.8.5.1 Tracking Jigs and Implements  In a semiconductor factory, it is necessary for any management of Jigsand/or Implements to be tracked.8.5.1.1 There are two types of information to track Jigs and/or Implements. One of them is transferringinformation: e.g., where it is and who use it. It is required to discriminate between logical information and physicalattachment. The other is historical information of the attachment: e.g., how much it was used, what condition theprocesses were and when it was repaired.8.5.1.2 Such an attachment as Jig or Implement is transferred from stock yard to equipment or the other way andmay be between two pieces of equipment. At the time it is picked up at source location for destination, the factshould be reported to Tracking System. When it arrives at the destination, this fact is required to be reported to thesystem. Verification has to be done at the destination before it is dealt: e.g., process, maintain or stored. If aproblem happens during transportation, an exception is raised.8.5.1.3 When it is used on equipment, e.g., for process or maintenance, its history information is accumulated andthe information is reported to the system at every milestone. Examples of the history information are time duration,cycle time, such process parameters as temperature and pressure, material characteristics and known damageoccurred during the process.8.5.1.4 The tracking system summarizes reported information. Clients of the system may inquire the information.One of the clients may be scheduler/ dispatcher and it may change process machine for specific material to get betterproduct quality.8.5.1.5 A client may ask target equipment to handle specific event which shows reaching limited cycle time for a jigon the equipment. Expected handling for the event, for example, is to stop processing. The client may ask to pausebefore starting a lot if current cycle time of the jig is very close to expiration cycle time.8.5.2 Application of Tracking System  Because this document specify basic capability tracking Jigs andImplements, specific applications for semiconductor device manufactures or equipment suppliers and such advancedapplications as securitized tracking are out of scope of this document.

Analyzing problem domain by object oriented paradigm is one of the best practices to be taken. Becausethis technology is frequently used in many SEMI standards, there is no confusion if this document follows the way.9.1.1 UML Representation  Above diagram is modeling of Tracking Capability for Jigs and/or Implements inUML diagram. It is not required to make system with object oriented programming language for compliant to thisspecification. Even if UML is typical object oriented representation, object oriented implementation may beexpected but may not be mandatory.9.1.2 Total Modeling  To make sure what the tracking system is, the model depicted above describes not justtracking information acquisition but also includes fundamental management of the whole tracking system.9.1.2.1 Acquisition of Minimum Tracking Information  Such capabilities as awareness of Attachments,accumulation of use history until release timing and its report are required to acquire use-history of Jigs and/orImplements on equipment. Cross-hatched classes (HistoryBuffer and Secondment) in light red and theircollaboration correspond to the acquisition capabilities. These capabilities are usually implemented on equipment.9.1.2.2 Action on Expiration  One of the biggest purposes of tracking such Attachments as Jigs and/orImplements is to prevent misprocessing with invalid attachments. An Attachment may be invalid when its use getsbeyond expected duration or cycles. This is such a capability as an expected action when an Attachment has beenexpired by facing invalid situation. Light-red grided class (Expiry) and its collaboration correspond to the specialAction capabilities. This capability is usually implemented on equipment.9.1.2.3 Identification and Verification of Attachments  Such information system as equipment controllers may notunderstand what the attachment is even if attachment ID is known. Capability to understand that and verify betweeninformation and physical attachment helps not only above fundamental capability but also ensured tracking. Pink-hatched classes (JitMachine and Invoice) and their collaboration correspond to this capability. This capability isalso implemented on equipment usually.9.1.2.4 Tracking Information Management  Such information system as Inventory is necessary to manage andapply acquired Attachment tracking information effectively. Blue Thick-shadowed classes (Attachment,HistoryRecord, Inventory and PublicLocation) and their collaboration correspond to this capability. This capabilityis usually installed on master equipment, cell controller or host computer. Or it may be distributed on theseplatforms.

SEMI T12-0305 © SEMI 2004, 2005 6 9.1.2.5 Further Application Interface  Final purposes of tracking such attachments as Jigs and Implements arecontrolling life time of attachments, increasing effectiveness of attachments, preventing falt process and achievegood quality of products. In this regard this interface capability helps applications. Green light shadowed class(HistoryDB) corresponds this capability. This capability may be installed on the host or application server.9.1.3 Collaboration in Class Modeling  An example of collaboration is as follows.9.1.3.1 Application seeks certain type of jigs through HistoryDB. It finds good ones to produce expensive products.It asks Inventory where they are.9.1.3.2 It picks up the ones and delivers them to target equipments. It updates Inventory and Inventory sendsinvoices to JitMachines. Invoice object is created on each JitMachine. At the time each jig arrives at each piece oftarget equipment, the Invoice verifies. If verification succeeds, this fact is notified to Inventory, location is updated,Secondment is created and JitMachine identifies what the sent jigs are. At the same time HistoryBuffer is alsocreated by the Secondment.9.1.3.3 Equipment runs. HistoryBuffer accumulates events, process conditions and cycle. At some moment, itreports the buffer content to Inventory. The Inventory manages HistoryRecord.9.2 Attachment  Attachment represents a Jig or an Implement. This concept is used to handle common nature ofthe both items.9.2.1 Attachment object  Attachment object represents such supporting resource as Jig or Implement logically.Attachment object is an instance of Attachment class defined later. Attachment object identifies correspondingphysical attachment and its information. This object is abbreviated as Attachment in this document and oftenobject is omitted.

This class generalizesJig and Implement registered in an Inventory. This class is illustrated as above for reference.9.2.2.1 Responsibility of Attachment  This class is responsible for holding and organizing such information ashistory for a Jig or Implement belonging to an Inventory.9.2.2.1.1 To complete the responsibility it accepts creation/removal of a HistoryRecord, adding events or incrementtime/duration requests and inquiry. They are defined as services of Attachment in this specification. Service namesmay be different from capabilities above.9.2.2.1.2 Inherent data is used to complete the responsibility. The data is also referred to as attributes and they haveto be defined in some way. This document doesnt define attributes directly with attribute definition table shown insome SEMI standard documents but defines them indirectly as service parameters.9.2.2.1.3 Behavior is also defined to complete the responsibility. Behavior is often represented by collaborationwith outside of this class and state model. Collaboration reflects a part of associations of this class with others.Collaboration works by asking services defined on accompanying object which is the other end of association onclass diagram. State model is representation of the other part of behavior of this class. However it has to be definedif this class has explicit state, state model is not defined here because this class is stateless.

Or it maybe divided into a few sub-inventories by type or category for convenience of managing people. Even if so aninventory of a type of attachments used for specific type of equipment is required to be seen as one whole inventoryby inventory user. Because inventory is a logical matter rather than a physical one, some of the attachments can beshared by another inventory for different types of equipment and both inventories can be managed without anyconfusion.

This class hasa couple of parallel substates: USING and EXPIRATION.9.13.2.1.3.1 USING  This substate specifies use of Secondment whether it is in-use or not.9.13.2.1.3.2 NOTUSED  One of substates of USING state. Attachment (Secondment) is located somewhere onequipment but it is not used for such intension as process or maintenance.

It doesnt matter where it is on equipment but9.13.2.1.3.4 EXPIRATION  This substate specifies effectiveness of Secondment whether it is expired or not. Ifthere are more than one expiration condition, more than one EXPIRATION substates could be paralleled but its outof specification of this document. If all the conditions doesnt fit, it must be EFFEVTIVE and if one of theconditions fired, it must be EXPIRED.9.13.2.1.3.5 EFFECTIVE  One of substates of EXPIRATION state. This substate represents that Attachment(actually Secondment) is not expired and it is no problem to keep using.9.13.2.1.3.6 NOTUSED  One of substates of EXPIRATION state.
