Original edition published by ASTM International as ASTM F1188-88. Last previous edition SEMI MF1188-02.INTRODUCTIONPrior to 2002, ASTM Test Method F 1188 used a long baseline for the 1107 cm1 oxygenabsorption peak. This long baseline was drawn between the average transmittances in the regionsfrom 900 to 1000 cm1 and from 1200 to 1300 cm1. The same baseline was used in ASTM TestMethod F 121, the predecessor to Test Method F 1188, and also in the analysis of infrared datafrom the Grand Round Robin (GRR) experiment. 1 The GRR experiment resulted in a calibrationfactor between the infrared absorption coefficient at 1107 cm1 and the absolute interstitial oxygencontent known as IOC-88. This calibration factor is utilized in the current editions of all knownstandardized test methods for oxygen content of silicon, including DIN 50438, Part 1; and JEITAEM-3504; as well as the current Chinese National Standard (GB).The long baseline method is being retained in the form published in the 1993a edition of this testmethod in Appendix 1. However, the long baseline is subject to uncertainties due to perturbationsin the IR absorption at the end-point regions arising from effects other than absorption byinterstitial oxygen. Use of a shorter baseline, drawn between 1040 and 1160 cm1, which is lessaffected in this manner,2 results in improved precision of the method. Use of the shorter baselineis introduced into this test method to replace the long baseline method. Although the use of thisbaseline results in a somewhat smaller net absorption coefficient for the same oxygen content, thischange is not very large, and can be neglected in most cases. Optionally, to completely eliminatethe effect of the baseline changes, the measurement equipment may be calibrated with suitablecertified reference materials (CRMs) or reference materials derived from CRMs.NIST SRM3 2551 oxygen-in-silicon reference material, 4,5 which is the principal CRM used forcalibrating commercial infrared spectrophometers for oxygen measurements, was certified using asubset of the GRR specimens as the absolute references. Both the GRR specimens and the SRMspecimens were measured using a short baseline similar to that now incorporated in this testmethod. This resulted in (1) reduced measurement uncertainty for the SRM specimens, and (2) astrong metrological foundation provided by the GRR specimens. Consequently, the IOC-88results are available to the users of the SRMs without requiring a change in the calibration factoreven though the short-baseline method is used. 1 Baghdadi, A., Bullis, W.

Tables showing the relations between the IOC-88 interstitial oxygencalibration factor and other standardized calibration factors that have been used in the siliconsemiconductor industry can be found in SEMI M44. It should be emphasized that these factors areat times referred to in the literature by common names and at other times by the designation of thestandard where they were used. Furthermore, in the jargon of the industry, interstitial oxygencontent is frequently described as being determined in accordance with a particular standardizedmethod whereas, in actual fact, only the calibration factor is taken from the standard while themeasurement itself is made by whatever method is employed within the instrumentation used. 1 Purpose1.1 The presence of oxygen can be beneficial to certain manufacturing operations by preventing the formation ofprocess-induced defects. Oxygen is introduced into silicon wafers during the crystal growing process. Hence, it isimportant to control the oxygen content of silicon crystals.1.2 Measurement of the intensity of the 1107 cm1 oxygen-in-silicon band with an infrared spectrophotometerenables the determination of the value of the absorption coefficient and, hence, by the use of a calibration factor orlinear regression curve, the content of interstitial oxygen.1.3 This test method can be used as a referee method for determining the interstitial oxygen content of silicon slices.Knowledge of the interstitial oxygen content of silicon wafers is necessary for materials acceptance and control offabrication processes, as well as for research and development. 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers the determination of the interstitial oxygen content of single crystal silicon bymeasurement of an infrared absorption band at room temperature. This test method requires the use of an oxygen-free reference specimen. It is recommended that a reference material set, such as NIST SRM3 2551, 4 anothercertified reference material set for oxygen content of silicon,6 or reference materials traceable to the CRMs, be usedto calibrate the spectrophotometer in order to reduce bias.2.2 This test method requires the use of a computerized spectrophotometer, preferably a Fourier Transform Infrared(FT-IR) spectrophotometer. This method is incorporated into many modern FT-IR instruments.2.3 The useful range of oxygen concentration measurable by this test method is from 1  1016 atoms/cm3 to themaximum amount of interstitial oxygen soluble in silicon.2.4 If the spectrophotometer is calibrated using 2 mm thick double-side polished CRMs, this test method is suitablefor use only with 2 mm thick, double-side polished test specimens. It can be extended to the measurement of testspecimens polished on one or both sides with thickness in the range 0.4 mm to 4 mm with the use of workingreference materials traceable to the double-side polished CRMs.2.5 The oxygen concentration obtained using this test method assumes a linear relationship between the interstitialoxygen concentration and the absorption coefficient of the 1107 cm1 band associated with interstitial oxygen insilicon.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 6 In addition to NIST SRM 2551 (Office of Standard Reference Materials, National Institute of Standards and Technology, 100 Bureau Drive,Gaithersburg, MD 20899-2322), certified reference materials for measurements of the interstitial oxygen content of silicon can be obtained fromJEITA (see footnote 12) and from BCR (CRM 368 and CRM 369, from the Community Bureau of Reference, Commission of the EuropeanCommunities, rue de la Loi 200, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium)."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 9 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1188-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 20053 3 Limitations3.1 The oxygen absorption band overlaps a silicon lattice band. The oxygen-free reference specimen must bematched within \xb10.5% to the thickness of the test specimen in order to properly remove the effects of the siliconlattice absorption.3.2 Since both the oxygen band and the lattice band can change with the specimen temperature, the temperatureinside the spectrophotometer sample compartment must be maintained at 27 \xb1 5\xb0C during the measurement.3.3 Significant free carrier absorption occurs in n-type silicon with resistivity below 1 \u03a9cm, and in p-type siliconwith resistivity below 3.0 \u03a9cm. For test specimens below these resistivities, the reference crystal must be matchedin resistivity as well as in thickness. The resistivity match must be sufficiently close so that the transmittance of thetest specimen relative to the reference specimen at 1600 cm1 must be 100 \xb1 5 %.3.4 The free carrier absorption in n-type crystals with resistivities less than 0.1 \u03a9cm, or in p-type crystals withresistivities less than 0.5 \u03a9cm reduces the available energy below that required for the satisfactory operation ofmost spectrophotometers.3.5 The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the oxygen-in-silicon band at 300 K is 32 cm1.

The oxygen-free reference specimen is matched closely in thickness to the test specimen, so as toeliminate the effects of absorption due to silicon lattice vibrations.6.2 After conducting selected instrumental checks, the infrared transmittance spectrum is measured over thewavenumber range from 900 cm1 to 1300 cm1.6.3 The measured absorption coefficient of the 1107 cm1 oxygen-in-silicon band is then used to determine theinterstitial oxygen content of the silicon slice. 7 Apparatus7.1 Infrared Spectrophotometer , either a DIR (S or CA), or FT-IR instrument, as described in 5.2.2 and 5.2.3,respectively, may be used. It must be possible to set the resolution of the spectrophotometer to 4 cm1, or better, forFT-IR spectrophotometers, and to 5 cm1, or better, for DIR spectrophotometers. Use of an FT-IR spectropho-tometer is strongly recommended.7.2 The three following paragraphs apply only to FT-IR spectrophotometers:7.2.1 Zero Filling  When an FT-IR instrument collects an unsymmetrical interferogram, an additional set ofpoints whose values are all zero shall be added to the end of the collected interferogram such that the total number ofpoints for performing the Fourier transform is double the number of data points originally collected.7.2.2 Undersampling  The data collection method shall produce interferograms which, when zero-filled andFourier transformed, produce a spectrum containing at least two data points per resolution increment.

Thespecimens shall be held normal, or nearly normal, to the axis of the incident infrared beam (see 8.3).7.4 Equipment and Materials, for slicing and polishing crystals to a thickness similarity of 0.5% or less and asurface flatness of 2.25 m or better (one fourth the wavelength at the maximum absorption of the interstitialoxygen impurity band).7.5 Acid Fume Hood and Suitable Protective Gear, for use when stripping oxide films from specimens formeasurement.7.6 Micrometer Caliper, or other instrument suitable for the measurement of the thickness of the specimens to atolerance of \xb10.2%.7.7 Thermocouple-Millivolt Potentiometer, or other system suitable for measurements of the specimen temperatureduring test.7.8 Hydrofluoric Acid, 4.9% (10:1 v/v), in accordance with Grade 2 of SEMI C29.NOTE 1: Warning  The acids used in this test method are hazardous. All precautions normally used with these chemicalsshould be strictly observed. Obtain and read the Material Safety Data Sheet prior to the use of any chemical. 8 Testing of the Apparatus8.1 Evaluate the performance of S-DIR spectrometers according to Instrument Operation and Nature of TestSections of ASTM Practice E 932. Follow the appropriate paragraphs of these sections to evaluate the performanceof CA-DIR instruments.8.2 Verify a proper purge condition for the specimen chamber by monitoring water vapor or carbon dioxideabsorption bands. The water vapor line is monitored at 1521 cm1 and the carbon dioxide line at 667 cm1. Theinstrument shall be sufficiently well purged or evacuated that the transmittance at these locations is between 98 and102%.8.3 Under certain conditions, the spectrophotometer may have a nonlinear response, or be plagued by undesirableextraneous reflections between the specimen surfaces and the spectrometer components. Place a flat, double-sidepolished and high resistivity (greater than 5 \u03a9cm) silicon slice in the instrument. The effective transmittance of thesilicon slice, due to reflective losses at the silicon surfaces, should be 53.8% \xb1 2% in the 1600 cm1 to 2000 cm1region. In some instruments, this silicon slice may have to be placed at a small angle to the axis of the incoming IRbeam, in order to minimize undesirable reflections between the silicon surfaces, and the spectrometer components.This angle may be determined by initially placing the silicon slice normal to the axis of the incoming beam and thengradually tilting the sample while repeatedly obtaining the transmittance spectrum of the slice above 1600 cm1 .The optimum angle is reached when a flat baseline as close as possible to 53.8% \xb1 2% is obtained from 1600 cm1 to4000 cm1. This optimum angle is typically less than 10\xb0. 9 Calibration Specimens9.1 Obtain a set of certified reference materials (CRMs) for interstitial oxygen in silicon with the followingcharacteristics:9.1.1 Each specimen in the set is double-side polished and approximately 2 mm thick,9.1.2 The set covers the oxygen range of interest with three or more samples, 12 For a discussion of the phase correction computation, see Chase, D.

In the interim, some, but not complete, guidance for thiscalibration can be found in the NIST SRM 2551 Report. 5 10 Test Specimen10.1 Choose test specimens that are as homogeneous as possible, so that the oxygen content measured is a fairrepresentation of the oxygen content of the entire specimen. This is particularly important for dispersivespectrophotometers, since in many such instruments the illuminated area of the specimen varies during the scan. Forspecimens with a large lateral inhomogeneity, this area variation may result in the appearance of undesirableinstrumental artifacts in the spectra.10.1.1 Prepare a slice of the crystal to be tested so as to obtain two optically flat surfaces parallel to 5 min of arc orless, as measured with a micrometer caliper or other suitable instrument. The surfaces of the specimen must be asfree as possible of surface films.NOTE 3: When the specimen faces are parallel and well-polished, and the data are being obtained at a sufficiently highresolution, interference may occur between light rays reflecting from the front and back surfaces of the specimen. The contrast ofthe interference fringes depends upon the parallelism of the specimen surfaces, and the fringe spacing depends on the opticalthickness of the specimen. These fringes can obscure a weak spectral line and prevent accurate measurement of the baseline. Toprevent obscuration by these interference fringes, nonparallel specimen surfaces may be a necessity. However, the use ofspecimens with nonparallel surfaces can also result in photometric errors. Because silicon has a high refractive index, anynonparallelism of the specimen can displace the spectrometer beam relative to the active area of the detector. Thus, an apparentlowering of the transmission occurs. Improper positioning or nonparallelism of the specimen can be checked by rotating thespecimen to determine whether the transmission level stays constant. Any variation is a possible indication of problems with thespecimen positioning or preparation. 11 Reference Specimens11.1 Because a difference technique is used in this test method, prepare an oxygen-free reference specimen of thesame type of material as the sample.11.1.1 Choose the oxygen-free reference specimen from slices taken from five to ten different silicon crystals thatare thought to be free of oxygen. Compare these slices with one another, and choose the specimen with the lowestabsorption as the oxygen-free reference specimen. If no absorption is seen for any of the specimens, then theassumption can be made that all specimens contain less than the limit of detection of oxygen and any of thespecimens can be used as the oxygen-free reference specimen.11.1.2 Prepare the oxygen-free reference specimen to the same tolerances as the test specimen with a thickness ofequal to that of the test specimen to within \xb10.5%.11.2 Prepare separate oxygen-free reference specimens for each type of material to be tested. 12 Procedure12.1 Calibration of Spectrophotometer12.1.1 Obtain a set of certified reference materials for oxygen in silicon (see 9) and, if necessary, suitable sets oftraceable reference materials with different thickness or surface condition, or both.12.1.2 Use these reference materials to calibrate the spectrophotometer in accordance with manufacturersinstructions.

The single instrument repeatability of this testmethod, pooled over all 20 specimens in the test set, ranged from 0.4 to 1.2% (R1S) for the 18 laboratories in thestudy. 1 A1-5.2 The multilaboratory reproducibility for the same sets of test specimens was determined in the same study,with 18 participating laboratories, to be \xb1 3% (R1S).1 A1-6 BiasA1-6.1 This experiment also included measurements of the absolute oxygen content by a variety of physicalmethods. The uncertainty in the absolute determinations of oxygen content in silicon during the Grand RoundRobin results primarily from the uncertainty in the chemical analysis measurements and any variations in the oxygencontent of the various slices used in the test. The first of these is estimated to be about 6%, and the second isestimated to be much smaller. This uncertainty directly affects the assigned value of the IOC-88 calibration factor.Errors in this calibration factor cause errors in the value of the derived oxygen content. Therefore, the bias of thesemeasurements from these sources is estimated not to exceed 6%.A1-6.2 There is also the possibility of bias because of interfering peaks in the infrared spectrum at thewavenumbers where the baseline is determined. The magnitude of this bias varies from sample to sample andcannot be predicted.

Original edition published by ASTMInternational as ASTM F 1239-89. Last previous edition SEMI MF1239-02.1 Purpose1.1 Oxide precipitates in the bulk of a silicon wafer can act as gettering sites for contamination that may beintroduced during manufacture of circuits and devices. This contamination (usually metallic impurities), if notgettered, can reduce device manufacturing yields and degrade device or circuit performance. Thus, the oxygenprecipitation characteristics of the silicon wafer can significantly affect both yields and performance.1.2 Although interstitial oxygen concentration is an important factor in affecting the amount of oxygen precipitationthat occurs in silicon during a specific thermal cycle, the presence of other impurities such as carbon or nitrogen, anddifferences in dopant type and density, thermal history, or defect properties of the crystal can also affect theprecipitation characteristics. Thus, it is frequently necessary to choose particular material properties and preparationtechniques to obtain the desired precipitation characteristics for a particular application.1.3 This test method may be used to compare the oxygen reduction of two or more groups of silicon wafers. Thistest method is based on thermal cycles that simulate certain common device processing cycles.1.3.1 Cycle A, a one-step precipitation cycle, provides an indication of the native nucleation sites present in the as-received wafers.1.3.2 Cycle B, a two-step nucleation-precipitation cycle, simulates the precipitation that occurs in normal n-MOSdevice processing.1.4 These test methods may be used to compare qualitatively the precipitation characteristics of two or more groupsof wafers.1.5 These test methods may also be used to determine the uniformity of oxygen reduction across a wafer (inconjunction with SEMI MF951) or from wafer to wafer within a lot. 2 Scope2.1 These test methods cover complementary procedures for testing the oxygen precipitation characteristics ofsilicon wafers. It is assumed that the precipitation characteristics are related to the amount of interstitial oxygen lostduring specified thermal cycles.2.2 These test methods may be applied to any n- or p-type Czochralski silicon wafers of any orientation whosethickness, resistivity, and surface finish are such as to permit the oxygen concentration to be determined by infraredabsorption and whose oxygen concentration is such as to produce measurable oxygen loss.2.3 These test methods are not suitable for determining the width or characteristics of a denuded zone,'' a regionnear the surface of a wafer that is essentially free of oxide precipitates.2.4 Because these test methods are destructive, suitable sampling techniques must be employed.2.5 Determination of material performance in actual device fabrication situations is beyond the scope of thesemethods. However, by comparing the results of these tests with actual device yields and performance, criteria forselection of specific material characteristics may be established.2.6 The values stated in SI units are regarded as standard."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 20 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1239-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2005 2 NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.

Cycle A consists solely of a precipitationstep. Cycle B consists of a nucleation step followed by a precipitation step.6.4 After the thermal cycle, the oxide film is stripped and the final value of oxygen concentration is measured at thesame points on each wafer using the same technique and instrumentation as was used to determine the initial value.6.5 The oxygen reduction is determined for each wafer (or for each point on each wafer) tested as the differencebetween the initial and final values.6.6 If all samples have the same initial oxygen concentration (within a narrow range), the average oxygen reductionfor each test condition (such as, group or position on wafer) is computed, and the appropriate comparisons made.6.7 If the samples have initial oxygen concentrations that cover a relatively wide range, a plot of oxygen reductionagainst initial oxygen concentration is made for each group or position. Again appropriate comparisons can bemade. 7 Apparatus7.1 Infrared Absorption Spectrophotometer, as specified in SEMI MF1188 or DIN 50438, Part 1.7.2 Resistance Heated Tube Furnace, capable of providing temperatures in the range from 750\xb0C to 1050\xb0C to\xb12\xb0C over the length required to contain the load of wafers to be tested.

Original edition published by ASTMInternational as ASTM F 1366-92. Last previous edition SEMI MF1366-02.1 Purpose1.1 The presence of oxygen can be beneficial to certain manufacturing operations by preventing the formation ofprocess-induced defects. Oxygen is introduced into silicon wafers during the crystal growing process. Hence, it isvery important to control the oxygen content of silicon crystals.1.2 SIMS can measure the oxygen concentration in heavily-doped silicon substrates used for epitaxial silicon wherethe free carrier concentration obscures the infrared absorption and prevents the normal use of the infraredmeasurement as a characterization technique for the commercial production of silicon.1.3 The SIMS measurement allows for the production of controlled oxygen content in heavily-doped siliconcrystals.1.4 This test method can be used for process control, research and development, and materials acceptance purposes. 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers the determination of total oxygen concentration in the bulk of single crystal siliconsubstrates using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).2.2 This test method can be used for silicon in which the dopant concentrations are less than 0.2% (1  10 20atoms/cm3 ) for boron, antimony, arsenic, and phosphorus (see SEMI MF723). This test method is especiallyapplicable for silicon that has resistivity between 0.0012 and 1.0 \u03a9cm for p-type silicon and between 0.008 and 0.2\u03a9cm for n-type silicon (see SEMI MF43).2.3 This test method can be used for silicon in which the oxygen content is greater than the SIMS instrumentaloxygen background as measured in a float zone silicon sample, but the test method has a useful precision especiallywhen the oxygen content is much greater (approximately 10 to 20) than the measured oxygen background in thefloat zone silicon.2.4 This test method is complementary to infrared absorption spectroscopy that can be used for the measurement ofinterstitial oxygen in silicon that has resistivity greater than 1.0 \u03a9cm for p-type silicon and greater than 0.1 \u03a9cmfor n-type silicon (see SEMI MF1188). The infrared absorption measurement can be extended to between 0.02 and0.1 \u03a9cm for n-type silicon with minor changes in the measurement procedure.1 2.5 In principle, different sample surfaces can be used, but the precision estimate was taken from data on chemical-mechanical polished surfaces.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Oxygen from silicon oxide, carbon oxide, and water on the surface can interfere with the oxygen measurement.3.2 Oxygen adsorbed from the SIMS instrument chamber to the surface can interfere with the oxygen measurement. 1 Hill, D.

A specimen load includes one float zonesilicon specimen, two or more standard specimens, and the test specimen.11.1.2 Bake the loaded sample holder at 100\xb0C \xb1 10\xb0C for a minimum of 1 h in air.11.2 Instrument Tuning11.2.1 Turn on the instrument in accordance with the manufacturers instructions.11.2.2 Fill the liquid nitrogen or helium cold trap.11.3 Analytical Conditions11.3.1 Use a cesium primary ion current and focus, which maximizes the ion count rate for an appropriate siliconisotope.11.3.2 Typical analytical conditions are a 250 m by 250 m raster and 1-s integrations.

The raster area for eachanalysis must be the same.11.4.7 Calculate the ratio S(O/Si ) of oxygen count rate to silicon count rate using the recorded secondary ionintensities at the end of each profile in the second, third, and fourth rounds of profiles, thus obtaining three ratios perspecimen.11.4.8 Calculate the average S avg(O/Si) of the three ratios for each specimen in the holder.11.4.9 Compare the average ratio S avg-FZ (O/Si) for the float zone specimen to the average ratio S avg-sp(O/Si) ofthe other specimens. If the average ratio for the float zone specimens is not much less (approximately 10 times less)than the average ratio for the other specimens, then the precision of the measurement may be degraded. In this case,depending upon the desired precision, it may be necessary to either abort the analysis and find the cause of the highinstrumental background, or to increase the number of measurements per specimen.11.4.10 Calculate the relative standard deviation (RSD percent) of the ratio S(O/Si) for each specimen, includingthe calibration specimen, the float zone specimen, and the test specimen.11.4.11 Repeat the analysis of oxygen for specimens (other than float zone specimens) with a RSD percent greaterthan 3%.11.4.12 Record the specimen identification, O/Si ratios, average, standard deviation, and relative standarddeviation in a table and include the same for the float zone silicon specimen. 12 Calculations12.1 Load Line Calibration Procedure12.1.1 Calculate the slope m and intercept b of the load calibration line of infrared absorption oxygen values Fversus the SIMS average O/Si ratios S for the standards as follows: bmSF += (1)where m and b are calculated from the assigned infrared absorption oxygen values F1 and F2 of the two calibrationstandards and S1 and S2 are the measured average ratios of the O/Si for the two calibration standards. )()(2121SSFFm = (2) )()(121221SSSFSFb = (3) 12.1.2 Convert the SIMS O/Si ratios S u for each test specimen and for the float zone specimen to the infraredabsorption equivalent value Fu based on the calibration line (Equation 1) and as illustrated in Figure 1.12.2 Load Factor Calibration Procedure12.2.1 Calculate the calibration load factors, LF1 = F1/S1 and LF2 = F2/S2, of the assigned infrared absorptionoxygen F to the S ratio O/Si from the standard samples using the average ratios of the O/Si  from the calibrationstandards.12.2.2 Calculate the average load factor, LFavg, as follows: 2)( 21 LFLFLFavg+= (4)"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 31 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1366-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2005 6 Figure 1Load Line Calibration for SIMS Bulk Oxygen Analysis 12.2.3 Convert the SIMS O/Si ratios S u for each test specimen to the infrared absorption equivalent value Fu bymultiplying the S u by the average load factor LFavg derived from the calibration standards, as follows: avguu LFSF = (5) 13 Report13.1 Report the following information:13.1.1 The instrument used, the operator, and the date of the measurements,13.1.2 Identification of test and standard specimens,13.1.3 Calibration procedure used,13.1.4 The infrared absorption equivalent oxygen values for the test specimen and the float zone silicon specimen,and13.1.5 The relative standard deviations (RSD percent) of the oxygen values for the test specimen and the float zonesilicon. 14 Precision14.1 The precision was estimated for both the load line calibration and average load factor calibration proceduresusing 191 samples from one silicon wafer and measured in 191 different loads over a two-month period.

A1-1 The precision estimate was taken from data generated in one laboratory using three instruments and teninstrument operators. All the instruments were CAMECA IMS 3f or 4f SIMS instruments. The test specimens wereall taken from one silicon wafer that was lightly doped and verified by infrared absorption spectroscopy to haveuniform interstitial oxygen levels across the central region where the test specimens were taken. The test specimenswere chemically mechanically polished on one side. The standards had oxygen levels that bracketed the expectedlevel of oxygen of the test specimen.A1-2 The measurements were made in 191 loads over a two-month period.A1-3 Both the load line calibration and the average load factor calibration methods were used to convert the SIMSdata to infrared absorption equivalent oxygen. The load line calibration method gave an average oxygen level of18.64 ppma (IOC-88), a one standard deviation of 0.39 ppma, and a relative standard deviation of 2.09%. Afrequency distribution is shown in Figure A1-1. The average load factor calibration method gave an average oxygenlevel of 18.61 ppma (IOC-88), a one standard deviation of 0.365 ppma, and a relative standard deviation of 1.97%.A frequency distribution is shown in Figure A1-2.NOTE 1: The oxygen concentration scale in Figures A1-1 and A1-2 is given in Old ASTM units. These must be multiplied by0.652 to get the values of oxygen concentration in IOC-88 units. This difference in scale arises from an historical basis and doesnot affect the conclusions reached. Note also that the oxygen values in A1-3 have been adjusted to obtain the results in IOC-88units.

Original edition published by ASTM International as ASTM F 1389-92.Last previous edition SEMI MF1389-00.1 Purpose1.1 Electronic-grade polycrystalline silicon producersand users require information regarding impurities forquality assurance as well as for research anddevelopment purposes. Polysilicon is float-zoned and asample from the zoned rod is analyzed following thesetest methods to obtain impurity densities that can berelated to the impurity content of the starting material(see SEMI MF1723).1.2 Photoluminescence analysis identifies andquantifies the electrically active dopant impurities inmonocrystalline silicon. These test methods addressboron, phosphorus, arsenic, and aluminum, found asimpurities in electronic grade silicon.1.3 These test methods can be applied to doped andundoped float-zoned or Czochralski material. 2 Scope2.1 These test methods cover the simultaneousdetermination of electrically active boron, phosphorus,arsenic, and aluminum content in low-dislocationmonocrystalline silicon.NOTE 1: These chemical species can also be determined bythe low temperature infrared analysis procedure of SEMIMF1630.2.2 These test methods can be used for samples thathave dopant densities between approximately 1  1011and approximately 5  10 15 atoms/cm3.2.3 The concentrations obtained using these testmethods are based on an empirically determinedrelationship of the logarithm of the concentration to thelogarithm of specific luminescence line-intensity ratios.2.4 The empirical relationship established assumes aconstant sample excitation level for all measurementson a given instrument.2.5 To accommodate differences in instrumentation,two methods are included. Test Method A refers toprocedures appropriate for dispersive infraredspectrophotometers operating under the high sampleexcitation conditions and Test Method B refers to procedures appropriate for Fourier transforminstruments operating under low excitation conditions.2.5.1 Typical calibration curves for each test methodare provided. These curves are modified for eachinstrument using the analysis of standard samples asreference data. Once modified, the curves for a giveninstrument should produce sample dopant densityvalues that agree with other similarly operatedinstruments using the same test method. Data obtainedusing Test Method A may not agree with data obtainedusing Test Method B, hence values must be reportedwith reference to the test method used.NOTE 2: Several different methods of photoluminescenceanalysis are currently in practice worldwide. These testmethods address two of these, one (Test Method A) in useprimarily in Japan1 and the other (Test Method B) primarily inthe United States. Recently published works2,3 describe otherapproaches.2.6 Many laboratories use photoluminescence toanalyze epitaxial layers. However this applicationencounters many variables and the underlying physicsis not fully understood; hence these test methods do notattempt to outline standard practices regarding suchanalysis.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use.

Since the calculated concentrations arederived from the ratio of extrinsic features to theintrinsic feature, the ratio will be decreasing as theexcitation intensity is increasing. Thus, if a sample ismeasured at a higher excitation level than theinstrument is calibrated for, the calculatedconcentration will be artificially low, and vice versa.3.2 Sample surface damage, bulk defects, or otherlifetime reducers also affect the line-intensity ratios andoverall luminescence intensity owing to their tendencyto reduce the steady state population of excitons, thusmimicking the effects of a lower excitation intensity.Other mechanisms related to the presence of thesedefects may also introduce decalibrating effects. Someluminescence features are generated by defects; forexample, those at 6510 and 7050 cm1 are typical ofthermally stressed samples. Such features can providequalitative information about the presence of defects.5,6 3.3 The ratios and line widths of the siliconluminescence features vary strongly with temperature,hence variations in sample temperature must beavoided. Corrections for the effects of temperaturevariations are included in these test methods (seeSection 7.1).3.4 Overlapping Spectral Features3.4.1 The boron BTO (BE) feature at 8812.6 cm1overlaps the PTO (b1) feature at 8812.7 cm1 causing adirect error when calculating boron concentration. Thebeta-series PTO (b1) line is approximately one-tenth theintensity of the alpha series PTO (BE) line at 8806.6cm1, so a subtraction based on the amount ofphosphorus present can be made in the boron featuremeasurement. An alternative approach is to use theBTO (b1) boron line, which is free from a coincident 4 Nakayama, H., Nishino, T., and Hamakawa, Y.,Analysis of theExcitation Luminescence of Silicon for Characterization of theContent of Impurities, Jap.

The no-phonon, (NP) features for theseelements could be used providing the instrument iscalibrated for them.3.4.3 In general, the broad TO phonon region featurescan interfere, particularly when a sample containswidely differing levels of impurities. For example,when boron greatly exceeds phosphorus, the P NP(BE)line must be used, and when phosphorus greatlyexceeds boron, one of the approaches described inSection 3.4.1 must be used.3.5 Stress in samples can cause NP region featuresplitting and thus affect the established TO/NP lineratio for a given impurity. The concentrationscalculated from such spectra would be artificially low.Peak area calculation methods reduce themeasurement's sensitivity to line splitting effects.3.6 The calibration curves presented in these testmethods are traceable to resistivity measurements (seeSEMI MF723), neutron transmutation doped, (NTD)reference material, and low-temperature infraredabsorption spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements (as asecondary standard) (see SEMI MF1630).

These latter featuresare designated NP or no-phonon features. 6 Summary of Test Method6.1 A sample of monocrystalline silicon is cooled to 4.2K and photoexcited with greater-than-bandgap energylight at one of two intensities listed, depending upon thetype of instrument used.

Make no change to the slope of the curvesbecause the slopes are a function of the excitonrecombination dynamics only and are independent of agiven instruments optical response.10.1.4 These curves become the given instrumentscalibration curves for the analysis conditions used.10.2 Determine the short-term one-sigma precision ofthe instrument.NOTE 3: This procedure needs to be performed onlyoccasionally unless instrument characteristics have drifted orhardware changes have been made.10.2.1 Analyze a sample with impurity concentrationssimilar to typical samples analyzed by the instrument innormal operation nine times.10.2.2 Find the peak intensity as described in Section12 to obtain dopant densities.10.2.3 Calculate the open-sigma standard deviation forall impurities present. 11 Procedure11.1 Excitation Conditions11.1.1 Test Method AHigh Excitation IntensityConditions  Set the output of the argon ion laser to300 mW of 514.5 nm light.

Reduce spectral data as described in Section12.11.3.2 If the audit specimen results fall outside theacceptable control limits established for an instrument,the laser power may be adjusted to compensate for driftin the optical transfer efficiency of the sampleexcitation subsystem. If the source of drift cannot beascribed to this simple mechanism, thoroughlyinvestigate and correct the problem. Instrumentrecalibration may be required.

Original edition published by ASTM International asASTM F 1390-92. Last previous edition SEMI MF1390-0704.1 Purpose1.1 Warp can significantly affect the yield ofsemiconductor device processing.1.2 Knowledge of this characteristic can help theproducer and consumer determine if the dimensionalcharacteristics of a specimen wafer satisfy givengeometrical requirements.1.3 Changes in wafer warp during processing canadversely affect subsequent handling and processingsteps. These changes can also provide an importantprocess monitoring function.1.4 This test method is suitable for measuring the warpof wafers used in semiconductor device processing inthe as-sliced, lapped, etched, polished, epitaxial or otherlayer condition and for monitoring thermal andmechanical effects on the warp of wafers during deviceprocessing. 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers a non-contacting,nondestructive procedure to determine the warp ofclean, dry semiconductor wafers.2.2 This test method employs a two-probe system thatexamines both external surfaces of the wafersimultaneously.2.3 The test method is applicable to wafers 50 mm orlarger in diameter, and approximately 100 m andlarger in thickness, independent of thickness variationand surface finish, and of gravitationally induced waferdistortion.2.4 This test method is not intended to measure theflatness of either exposed silicon surface. Warp is ameasure of the distortion of the median surface of thewafer.2.5 This test method measures warp of a wafercorrected for mechanical forces applied during the test.Therefore, the procedure described gives theunconstrained value of warp.NOTE 1: This warp is indicated by the acronymGMLYMER in Appendix 2, Shape Decision Tree, of SEMIM1. NOTE 2: SEMI MF657 measures median surface warp usinga three-point back-surface reference plane. The back-surfacereference results in thickness variation being included in therecorded warp value. The use (in this test method) of amedian surface reference plane eliminates this effect. The use(in this test method) of a least-squares fit reference planereduces the variability introduced in three-point planecalculations by choice of reference point location. The use (inthis test method) of special calibration or compensatingtechniques minimizes the effects of gravity-induced distortionof the wafer.2.6 This test method includes several methods forcanceling gravity-induced deflection which couldotherwise alter the shape of the wafer.1 NOTE 3: One of these methods, the Representative WaferInversion Method, is covered by a patent held by ADECorporation, 80 Wilson Way, Westwood, MA 02090-1806.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 Any relative motion along the probe measuring axisbetween the probes and the wafer holding device duringscanning will produce error in the measurement data.Vibration of the test specimen relative to the probe-measuring axis will introduce error. Such errors areminimized by system signature analysis and correctionalgorithms. Internal system monitoring may also beused to correct non-repetitive and repetitive systemmechanical translations. Failure to provide suchcorrections may cause errors.3.2 If a measured wafer differs substantially indiameter, thickness, fiducials, or crystal orientationfrom that used for the gravitational compensationprocedure, the results may be incorrect. Estimates ofthe errors in gravity induced deflection for differences 1 Poduje, N., Eliminating Gravitational Effect in Wafer ShapeMeasurements, NIST/ASTM/SEMI/SEMATECH Technology Confe-rence, Dallas, TX.

If the crystal orientation of the sampleto be measured differs from the crystal orientation ofthe gravity-compensation wafer, then the measuredwarp value may differ from the actual warp value by upto 15%. Error tables for fiducial variation have notbeen generated.3.3 Different methods for implementing gravitationalcompensation may give different results. Varyinglevels of completeness of implementing a method mayalso give different results.3.4 Mechanical variations in wafer holding devicesbetween systems may introduce measurementdifferences. This test method allows the use of avariety of wafer holding devices (see Section 7.1.4.1);results obtained with different geometricalconfigurations of wafer holding device on the same testsamples may differ.3.5 Most equipment systems capable of thismeasurement have a definite range of wafer thicknesscombined with warp (dynamic range) that can beaccommodated without readjustment. If the samplemoves outside this dynamic range during eithercalibration or measurement, results may be in error. Anover-range signal can be used to alert the operator andmeasurement data examiners to this event.3.6 The quantity of data points and their spacing mayaffect the measurement results. This test method doesnot specify the data point spacing (see Section 7.1.4.2);results obtained with different data point spacings onthe same test samples may differ. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specifications for PolishedMonocrystalline Silicon WafersSEMI MF657  Test Method for Measuring Warp andTotal Thickness Variation on Silicon Wafers byNoncontact ScanningSEMI MF1241  Terminology of Silicon TechnologySEMI MF1530  Test Method for Measuring Flatness,Thickness, and Thickness Variation on Silicon Wafersby Automated Non-contact Scanning4.2 ASTM StandardE 691  Practice for Conducting an InterlaboratoryStudy to Determine the Precision of a Test Method2 2 Available from ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, WestConshohocken, PA 19428, Tel: 610-832-9500, Fax: 610-832-9555,Website ",(0,n.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.astm.org."},"http://www.astm.org.")," Appears in Volume 14.02 of AnnualBook of ASTM Standards.

Original edition published by ASTM International as ASTM F 1389-92. Last previous edition SEMI MF1389-00.1 Purpose1.1 Carbon may have an important role in defectformation processes. Some laboratories have attributedcarbon as being involved in the formation of swirl.Carbon has also been shown to serve as a nucleationcenter for the precipitation of oxygen.1.2 Although electrically inactive, substitutional carboncauses stress that can be observed by X-ray topography.1.3 Direct effects on the reverse bias characteristics ofpower devices and annealing problems in neutrontransmutation doped silicon have been associated withcarbon.1.4 This test method has applicability in productioncontrol, materials research, quality assurance, andmaterials acceptance. 2 Scope2.1 This referee test method1 covers the determinationof substitutional carbon concentration in single crystalsilicon. Because carbon may also reside in interstitiallattice positions when in concentrations near the solidsolubility limit, the results of this test method may notbe a measure of the total carbon concentration at suchconcentrations.2.2 The useful range of carbon concentrationmeasurable by this test method is from the maximumamount of substitutional carbon soluble in silicon downto about 0.1 parts per million atomic (ppma), that is,5  10 15 cm3 for measurements at room temperature, 1 This test method was developed in cooperation with the SiliconTechnologies Committee of the Japan Electronics and InformationTechnology Industries Association (JEITA). It is essentiallyequivalent to JEITA EM-9503, Standard Test Method forSubstitutional Atomic Carbon Content of Silicon by InfraredAbsorption, which is available from JEITA, 3rd floor, MitsuiSumitomo Kaijo Bldg.

At room temperatures(about 300 K), the absorption band peak is at 605 cm1or 16.53 m. At cryogenic temperatures (below 80 K),the absorption band peak is at 607.5 cm1 or 16.46 m.2.4 This test method is applicable to slices of siliconwith resistivity higher than 3 \u03a9cm for p-type andhigher than 1 \u03a9cm for n-type. Slices can be anycrystallographic orientation and should be polished onboth surfaces.2.5 This test method is intended to be used withinfrared spectrophotometers that are equipped tooperate in the region from 2000 to 500 cm1 (5 to 20m).2.6 This test method provides procedure and calculationsections for the cases where thickness values of test andreference specimens are both closely and not closelymatched.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior touse. 3 Limitations3.1 Stray light that reaches the detector tends to reducethe calculated absorbance value and thereby reduces thereported carbon concentration.3.2 The carbon level of the reference slice should beless than 2  10 15 atoms/cm3 (0.04 ppma) to minimizethe comparative error at room temperature. Thedetection limit at cryogenic temperatures (below 80 K)is about 0.01 ppma. Obtaining reference samples muchbelow 0.01 ppma in carbon content may prove to bedifficult. Therefore the measurement of very lowcarbon content silicon near the 0.01 ppma detectionlimit is necessarily a comparative measurement only."),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 50 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF1391-0704 \xa9 2004 22 3.3 Spectrophotometer technique is critical to asuccessful carbon determination. The manufacturer'sinstrument instruction manuals should be studied tofamiliarize the operator with the proper use of thespectrometer. Since the transmittance at the carbonpeak can be very low, while the transmittance at thebaseline regions is about 40%, extremely goodphotometric linearity is critical. Wavenumber precisionis also critical because the carbon peak lies on theshoulder of a very intense lattice absorption band.3.4 The FWHM of the carbon absorption band at roomtemperature must be less than 6 cm1 for acceptablemeasurements. At cryogenic temperatures (below 80K), it must be less than 3 cm1 for acceptablemeasurements. Excessive width may be due toimproper thickness matching, to stress, or to the use ofa low resolution setting of the instrument. In dispersiveinstruments, excessive widths can also result fromincorrect instrument balance setting or too fast a scanspeed. In Fourier transform instruments, excessivewidths can result from the use of a source-definingaperture that is too wide.3.5 Specimens that do not exceed the instrument beamsize cause error. Use of apertures at the sample, orpreferably beam condensers to reduce the beam size atthe sample, can correct this problem.3.6 The main two-phonon lattice band of silicon, atabout 610 cm1 (16 m), is very intense; the absorptioncoefficient for this band is about 9 cm1 at roomtemperature, and about 5 cm1 at 78 K.2 This broadband peak is close to the wavelength of the carbon-in-silicon band and so presents a problem in measuring theintensity of the carbon band.3.7 Reference and test slices must be as close aspractically possible to the same temperature to avoidthe effects of temperature on the intensity of the latticeband.3.8 The minimum detection level of this test method islimited by the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum.Thus attaining the highest possible sensitivity by thistest method requires long measurement times and stablespectrophotometers.3.9 Free carrier absorption in silicon specimens withresistivities less than 3 \u03a9cm for p-type, or 1 \u03a9cm forn-type, reduces the available energy below the levelrequired for satisfactory operation of mostspectrophotometers.3.10 For samples at cryogenic temperatures (below 80K), plane parallel, polished surfaces may causeinterference fringes on the spectrum. Increasing the 2 Johnson, F. A., Proc. Physics Society 73, 265272 (1959). sample thickness or inducing a wedge (non-flatness) inthe sample reduces these interference fringes. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardSEMI MF1241  Terminology of Silicon Technology4.2 ASTM StandardE 131  Terminology Relating to MolecularSpectroscopy3 NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 General definitions for terms related to infrared ab-sorption spectroscopy are found in ASTM TerminologyE 131.5.2 Definitions for terms related to silicon materialstechnology are found in SEMI MF1241.5.3 Definitions5.3.1 background spectrum, n  in FT-IR instruments,the single-beam spectrum obtained without a specimenin the infrared light path that is usually obtained withonly nitrogen, dry air, or a vacuum in the beam.5.3.2 baseline, n  a straight line interpolationbetween points on either side of the carbon peak of theabsorbance spectrum, drawn to represent the spectrumthat would have been obtained in the absence of theimpurity.5.3.3 baseline absorbance, n  the value of thebaseline at the wavenumber corresponding to thecarbon peak that is used for evaluating the absorbancepeak height.5.3.4 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer,n  type of infrared spectrometer in which the data areobtained as an interferogram.5.3.4.1 Discussion  An interferogram is a record ofthe modulated component of the interference signalmeasured by the detector as a function of retardation inthe interferometer.
