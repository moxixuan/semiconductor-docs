1  Purpose
1. 1    The  purpose  of  this  test  is  to  measure  particle
contribution  by  mass  flow  controllers  (MFCs)  in  high-
purity gas systems.
2  Scope
2. 1    This  document  describes  a  test  method  that  yields
statistically     significant     comparisons     of     particle
contribution  among  mass  flow  controllers  under  test
conditions.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1    This  document  is  not  intended  as  a  method  for
monitoring   in   situ   particulate   performance   once   a
particular MFC has been tested.
3. 2    The  test  medium  is  limited  to  nitrogen.  Actual
performance  under  normal  operating  conditions  may
differ.
3. 3  The accuracy of the data generated by this method
is  limited  to  the  accuracy  of  the  particle  measuring
instruments used.
3. 4    This  test  method  is  intended  for  use  by  operators
who  understand  the  use  of  the  apparatus  at  a  level
equivalent to one year of experience.
3. 5    This  test  method  should  not  be  expected  to  yield
comparable results from one test set up to another, due
to    the    limitations    of    current    particle    counting
technology.
3. 6  Results may be compromised by the methods used
to construct the apparatus.

6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1    Background  count  is  determined  for  steady  state
control,  dynamic  control,  and  impact  tests.  The  steady
state control mode test, dynamic control mode test, and
impact  test  are  run  by  counting  particles  for  the  time
necessary to achieve a stable particle level. Background
testing is performed again.
7  Significance and Use
7. 1    The  significance  of  this  test  method  is  that  it
defines  a  procedure  for  testing  mass  flow  controllers
intended  for  installation  into  a  high-purity  gas  system.
It is intended for use by manufacturers and end users.
8  Apparatus

counts for the system.



SEMI E66-1103 © SEMI 1997, 2003 5
8. 12  Fittings  —  Face  seal  connectors  or  compression  fittings,  depending  on  test  component  end  connections.  The
end connection fittings of each DUT being compared must be of the same type.
8. 13  Metal Gaskets — New gaskets should be used for each new connection.

8. 15  Instrumentation  —  Condensation  nucleus  counter  (CNC)  or  laser  particle  counter  (LPC)  to  collect  particle
count data.
8. 16  Isokinetic  Sampler  (IKS)  —  A  static  device  used  to  collect  a  representative  sample  that  is  not  influenced  by
flow characteristics and/or particle size (see Figure 3). Other designs of isokinetic samplers are permitted as long as
they collect a representative sample of the flow.

NOTE: Position the delivery ramp so that the position of impact is at the midpoint of the axial centerline of the device under test.
9  Sampling, Test Specimens, and Test Units
9. 1    MFCs  regulate  flows  greater  than  or  less  than  the  flow  requirements  of  particle  counters;  therefore,  two
different sampling techniques have been defined, isokinetic sampling and direct sampling.
9. 1.1  Direct Sampling — The direct sampling method is used when the test flow is less than or equal to the sample
flow. (See Figure 1.)
9. 1.1.1  In this case, gas exiting the DUT is introduced directly into the CNC. A tee, equipped with a filtered branch,
is inserted between the DUT and the CNC to provide make-up flow to the CNC. The volume and overall length of
the tubing connecting the DUT to the tee assembly should be minimized.



SEMI E66-1103 © SEMI 1997, 2003 6
9. 1.2  Isokinetic  Sampling  —  Isokinetic  sampling  is
used when the test flow is greater than the sample flow.
(See Figure 2.)
NOTE  1:    An  alternative  size  IKS  may  be  substituted  for  the
IKS described in Sections 9.1.2.1 through 9.1.2.7 as long as it
collects   a   representative   sample   of   particles   that   is   not
influenced by flow characteristics and/or particle size.
9. 1.2.1    Select  the  appropriate  IKS  (see  Figure  3)  from
Table  1  for  the  test  flow.  This  is  the  smallest  IKS  that
exceeds the flow of the DUT.
9. 1.2.2    The  average  velocity  of  the  gas  through  the
sampling  probe  shall  approximate  the  average  velocity
in  the  tubing  in  which  the  sampling  probe  is  inserted.
The  sample  flow  used  to  calculate  the  sampling  probe
diameter is the total flow drawn by the counter.
9. 1.2.3    The  tip  of  the  sampling  probe  is  to  have  a  30_
taper on the outside diameter.
9. 1.2.4    The  pick-off  point  is  to  be  centered  within  the
flow stream.
9. 1.2.5    The  pick-off  point  is  to  be  at  a  minimum
distance  of  15  diameters  of  the  primary  flow  tube
upstream or downstream from any connection.
9. 1.2.6    Flow  stability  within  the  isokinetic  sampler  is
maintained by the bypass MFC.
9. 1.2.7    To  determine  the  dimensions  of  the  isokinetic
sampler,  as  shown  in  Table  1,  the  following  equations
and conditions are used:
10  Preparation of Apparatus
10. 1  Setup  and  Schematic  for  Direct  Sampling  —  See
Figure 1.
10. 1.1  Install the spool piece between points A and B.
10. 1.2    Set  nominal  supply  pressure  to  308.10  kPa  (30
psig).
10. 1.3  Cycle the supply MFC, switching between a low
flow   and   maximum   purge   flow   as   quickly   as   is
reasonably  possible.  Cycle  every  five  seconds  for  at
least  30  minutes.  The  maximum  purge  flow  should  be
as high as possible and no less than twice the test rate.
During  this  initial  cleanup,  the  particle  counter  should
be off-line.
10. 1.4      Moisture   from   an   inboard   leak   can   cause
particle  counts  on  some  particle  counters.  Test  the
system  for  leak  integrity  per  SEMI  F1  –  Subsystems
Inboard Leak Test.
10. 2  Setup  and  Schematic  for  Isokinetic  Sampling  —
See Figure 2.
10. 2.1  Install the spool piece between points A and B.
10. 2.2    Set  nominal  supply  pressure  to  308.10  kPa  (30
psig).
10. 2.3  Cycle the supply MFC, switching between a low
flow   and   maximum   purge   flow   as   quickly   as   is
reasonably  possible.  Cycle  every  five  seconds  for  at
least  30  minutes.  The  maximum  purge  flow  should  be
as high as possible and no less than twice the test rate.
During  this  initial  cleanup,  the  particle  counter  should
be off-line.
10. 2.4      Moisture   from   an   inboard   leak   can   cause
particle  counts  on  some  particle  counters.    Test  the
system  for  leak  integrity  per  SEMI  F1  –  Subsystems
Inboard Leak Test.
10. 3  Select the appropriate isokinetic sampler based on
the maximum test flow of the DUT, using Table 1 and
Figure 3. The size of the sampler should be equal to or
greater than the maximum test flow.
11  Calibration and Reference Standards
11. 1  Calibrate  instruments  regularly  according  to  the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
12  Test Procedure
The  test  apparatus  is  to  be  enclosed  in  a  Class  100
environment  (in  accordance  with  ISO  14644).  Test
must  be  performed  in  the  sequence  described  below.
(See Figures 5 and 6.)
Measure  DUT  in  purge  mode  to  determine  flow  or  use
the   value   supplied   by   the   manufacturer.   This   will
determine   which   apparatus   to   use,   direct   sampling
(Figure 1) or IKS (Figure 2). Both of the test apparatus
may  be  required  for  testing  a  wide  range  of  flow
controllers.

Statistical Validity Subroutine

12. 1  Procedure  for  Direct  Sampling  —  See  Figures  5
and 6.
12. 1.1  Background   Count   Determination   —   Insert
spool piece between points A and B (see Figure 1).
12. 1.2  Steady State Control Mode Background Test —
Set  supply  MFC  (SFC)  to  the  intended  test  flow  value
of  the  DUT.  For  this  test,  the  100%  full  scale  value  is
recommended.
12. 1.2.1      Count   particles   for   the   time   necessary   to
achieve a stable particle level.
12. 1.3  Dynamic  Control  Mode  Background  Test  —
Cycle  the  SFC  from  10%  to  100%  of  the  DUT’s  rated
flow. The cycle period is equal to two times the settling
time  of  the  DUT  with  the  longest  settling  time.  (This
will ensure that all MFCs in a given test are tested at the
same cycle time.)



SEMI E66-1103 © SEMI 1997, 2003 9
12. 1.3.1      Count   particles   for   the   time   necessary   to
achieve a stable particle level.
12. 1.4  Purge Mode Background Test — Set the SFC to
100% of the rated flow of the DUT.
12. 1.4.1      Count   particles   for   the   time   necessary   to
achieve a stable particle level.
12. 1.5  Impact  Background  Test  (optional)  —  Set  the
SFC  to  the  intended  flow  value  of  the  DUT.  For  this
test, the 100% full scale (FS) value is recommended.
12. 1.5.1    Maintain  the  test  flow  in  the  spool  piece  to
achieve a constant particle level. Strike the spool piece
once a minute (using the mechanical shock device) until
a constant particle level is achieved. (See Figure 4.)
12. 1.5.2      Count   particles   for   the   time   necessary   to
achieve a stable particle level.
12. 1.6  Steady  State  Control  Mode  Test  —  Set  SFC  to
10% setpoint of the DUT’s rated flow.
12. 1.6.1    Remove  the  spool  piece  by  disconnecting  the
downstream   fitting   and   then   the   upstream   fitting.
Immediately  install  the  test  component  in  a  fully  open
position by connecting the upstream fitting and then the
downstream  fitting.  Take  extreme  care  to  minimize
contamination    of    the    test    apparatus    during    this
operation.
12. 1.6.2  Set the SFC in purge mode (emulates tubing).
12. 1.6.3  Set the DUT to the desired flow. For this test,
the 100% full scale value is recommended.
12. 1.6.4      Count   particles   for   the   time   necessary   to
achieve a stable particle level.
12. 1.7  Dynamic  Control  Mode  Test  —  Keep  the  SFC
in purge mode (emulates tubing).
12. 1.7.1    Cycle  the  DUT  from  10%  to  100%  of  the
DUT’s  rated  flow.  The  cycle  period  is  equal  to  two
times  the  settling  time  of  the  DUT  with  the  longest
settling time. (This will ensure that all MFCs in a given
test are tested at the same cycle time.)
12. 1.7.2      Count   particles   for   the   time   necessary   to
achieve a stable particle level.
12. 1.8  Purge  Mode  Test  —  Set  SFC  to  100%  of  the
DUT’s rated flow.
12. 1.8.1  Operate DUT in the purge mode until a stable
particle level is achieved.
12. 1.9  Impact   Test   (optional)   —   This   test   is   to
immediately follow the purge mode test.
12. 1.9.1    Keep  the  SFC  set  to  100%  of  the  DUT’s  rate
flow.

stable particle level is achieved.
12. 1.9.3  Strike the DUT once a minute until consistent
particle  transients  are  achieved  using  the  mechanical
shock device. (See Figure 4.)
12. 1.10  Background  Test  —  Repeat  all  background
tests performed in Section 12.1.1.

the  procedures  described  in  Section  12.1,  with  the
following exceptions:
12. 1.10.2    To  establish  the  background,  see  Figure  2
and  the  example  below.  With  the  spool  piece  in  place,
the throttle valve V1 fully open, and the bypass MFC in
purge mode, set the SFC to the maximum inlet flow of
the  IKS.  Adjust  V1  and  monitor  the  flow  through  the
bypass MFC until the difference between the SFC flow
and  the  bypass  MFC  flow  is  equal  to  the  intended  test
flow  of  the  DUT.  The  throttle  valve  V1  should  remain
fully  open  for  all  other  tests  that  use  the  test  set-up  in
Figure 2.

t-TESTING; COMPARISON OF BACKGROUND MEAN AND DEVICE
MEAN
NOTE: This appendix was approved as an official part of SEMI E66 by full letter ballot procedure.
A2-1
A2-1.1  The background and DUT are expected to have low particle counts. Therefore, a statistical method is needed
to  determine  if  there  is  a  difference  between  background  and  DUT  particle  counts.  The  t-test  is  a  method  of
determining  the  actual  statistical  difference  between  the  mean  background  particle  count  and  the  mean  device
particle count. It can be used to characterize the particle contribution by the MFC Record results in Table A2-1.

TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING RELIABILITY OF MASS FLOW
CONTROLLER
This test method was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility of
the North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards
Committee on December 4, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org February 2004; to be published March

# 2004

2004.  Originally published September 1997.
1  Purpose
1. 1        This    document    describes    a    method    to    help
determine   the   ability   of   an   MFC   to   meet   the
manufacturer’s  published  specifications  over  its  life
time.  The  results  of  the  test  will  also  be  useful  in  the
comparison of MFCs.
2  Scope
2. 1        This    procedure    applies    to    MFCs    used    in
semiconductor gas systems.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1    This  procedure  is  to  be  used  only  in  conjunction
with  another  existing  parametric  test  for  mass  flow
controllers   to   obtain   the   reliability   data   for   that
particular parametric test.
3. 2  New MFCs shall be used for reliability testing. An
MFC that has been put through this test method may be
tested for reliability again.
3. 3    In  addition  to  this  procedure,  the  parametric  test
may  also  cycle  the  valve.  These  cycles  should  be
ignored  for  determining  the  cumulative  cycles  that  are
described in the data table.
3. 4    This  test  will  not  address  root  cause  analysis  of
failures.
3. 5      Read   points   have   been   selected   for   this   test
procedure  so  that  the  test  will  take  approximately  six
months  to  complete.  The  read  point  schedule  given  is
only  a  suggested  schedule  and  if  the  user  feels  that  a
different   read   point   schedule   would   better   suit   his
needs,  this  test  method  can  still  be  used  to  obtain
reliability data.

or  a  deviation  from  a  user-defined  specification  that
results  in  a  condition  that  makes  the  MFC  inadequate
for the user’s process.
5. 2.3  parametric  test  —  the  test  method  that  deter-
mines  the  data  for  which  reliability  information  is
sought (e.g., accuracy test or particle test, SEMI E66).
5. 2.4  readpoint  —  cumulative  cycles  applied  to  the

conditions, for a specified period of time.
5. 2.6  soft  failure  —  failure  that  occurs  when  an  MFC
no longer meets the manufacturer's specification for the
parameter under test.
6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1      The   MFC   is   installed   in   a   fixture   capable   of
applying and recording a number of flow cycles. When
the number of cycles specified in the readpoint schedule
is  reached,  cycling  is  suspended,  parametric  tests  are
per-formed,  and  the  cycling  is  resumed  until  either  the
next  readpoint  is  reached,  or  the  MFC  experiences  a
hard   failure.   After   the   cycling   is   completed,   the
parametric   test   data   is   analyzed   to   determine   the
reliability of each parameter.
7  Significance and Use
7. 1  This test provides an estimate of the reliability of a
mass flow controller. The results of the test will also be
useful  in  the  comparison  of  MFCs.  The  data  provided
by  this  test  can  help  end  users  determine  the  reliability
of equipment that uses MFCs.
7. 2      The   following   parameters   and   associated   test
methods should be tested with this test method to obtain
reliability data:

Parameter                               Test                               Method
Particle Contribution SEMI E66
Reproducibility & Zero Drift SEMI E69

90120391B-STD
Step Response SEMI E17

7. 3  The following modifications to the preceding para-
metric test methods are suggested to abbreviate the time
required to complete the reliability test:
7. 3.1  SEMI E66 (Particle Contribution)  —  Abbreviate
this  test  method  to  perform  only  the  dynamic  control
mode  test.  Perform  Sections  12.1.3  and  12.1.7,  and
eliminate Sections 12.1.2, 12.1.4, 12.1.5, 12.1.6, 12.1.8,
12. 1.9,    and    12.1.10.    Refer    to    Sections    5.2.1
(Background),  5.2.3  (Dynamic),  and  Figure  5  (Particle
Test Flow Chart).
7. 3.2  SEMI  E69  (Reproducibility  &  Zero  Drift)  —
Omit Sections 12.1 and 12.2.
7. 3.3  SEMI  F1  (Leak  Integrity)  —  The  intent  of  the
reliability  test  method  is  to  detect  the  development  of
gross  leaks  in  the  DUT  due  to  cycling  of  the  DUT
valve.  The  inboard  component  leak  test  portion  of  this
standard should be performed.
7. 3.4  SEMI E17 (Step Response) — No abbreviation is
necessary  for  this  test.  However,  perform  this  test  with
the  modifications  noted  in  the  SEMATECH  Guide  to
Provisional  Test  Methods  for  Mass  Flow  Controllers,
SEMASPEC 92071220B-STD.
7. 4    Change  in  the  performance  characteristics  of  the
MFC,  as  measured  by  the  above  tests,  may  also  be
monitored and analyzed as indicative of drift.
8  Apparatus
8. 1    In  addition  to  the  apparatus  listed  below,  the  user
must also acquire any apparatus required to perform the
parametric test for which reliability data is needed. (See
documents cited in Section 7.2.)
8. 1.1  Power supply
8. 1.2  NIST    (or    equivalent    recognized    standards
agency) — traceable flow calibration system
8. 1.3    MFC  control  cables,  as  many  as  required  in
Section 8.1.4
8. 1.4  Mass flow controllers for controlling test flows in
addition to the DUT MFCs, as many as required for the
test setup
8. 1.5  Cycling fixture
9  Materials
9. 1    In  addition  to  the  materials  listed  below,  the  user
must also acquire any materials required to perform the
parametric test for which reliability data is needed. (See
documents  cited  in  Section  7.2.)  Since  reliability  data
for leak integrity is being sought, helium cannot be used
during the cycling procedure.
9. 1.1  Source of nitrogen (99.999%)
10  Sampling, Test Specimens, and Test Units
10. 1    Three  MFCs  are  required  for  meaningful  data
analysis. However, 20 to 30 MFCs are a recommended
minimum. A larger sample size provides a more precise
estimate of reliability.



SEMI E67-0304 © SEMI 1997, 2004 3
11  Preparation of Apparatus
11. 1  The setup for the parameter under test is described
in   the   document   for   that   particular   parameter   (see
Section 7.2).
12  Calibration and Reference Standards
12. 1    Any  required  instrument  calibration  or  use  of
reference  standards  must  be  done  in  accordance  with
the  particular  parametric  test  for  which  reliability  data
is needed.
13  Conditioning
13. 1      Conditioning   requirements   are   those   of   the
particular  parametric  test  for  which  reliability  data  is
needed.
14  Procedure
14. 1  Connect all MFCs under test in parallel.
14. 2    Perform  the  parametric  test  before  any  cycling  is
done  and  note  the  resulting  data  on  the  data  sheet
(Table 1). This is the first readpoint (see Figure 1).

Flowchart for Reliability Test Procedure

NOTE: Do not count the cycles that occur during the parametric test.
14. 3  Cycle the MFCs to the next readpoint in Table 1. Two types of cycles are applied to the MFC to simulate more
realistically  the  MFC’s  field  environment.  Alternate  between  the  two  types  of  cycles  as  illustrated  in  Figure  2.
Maintain each setpoint for a fixed period of time. Use one of the following times based upon the settling time of the
slowest  DUT.  If  the  settling  time  is  less  than  or  equal  to  1.25  seconds,  use  a  time  period  of  2.5  seconds.  If  the
settling time is less than or equal to 2.5 seconds and greater than 1.25 seconds, use a time period of 5 seconds. If the
settling time is greater than 2.5 seconds, use a time period of twice the settling time.

Types of Cycles

14. 4    Discontinue  cycling.  Perform  the  parametric  tests
on all MFCs and record the results on the data sheet. If
any MFC experiences a soft failure, record the data but
do not stop the cycling procedure. However, if an MFC
experiences  a  hard  failure,  record  the  data,  discontinue
testing   this   MFC,   and   take   appropriate   action   to
maintain system integrity.
NOTE  2:    The  test  does  not  require  mention  of  the  cause  for
hard failure, as it is beyond the scope of this document.
14. 5    The  parametric  tests  should  be  performed  in  the
following order: particle, accuracy, response, and leak.
14. 6    Perform  all  of  the  parametric  tests  on  a  single
MFC  before  proceeding  to  the  next  one.  Record  the
order  of  the  MFCs  tested  and  the  time  since  the  test
stand was idled.
14. 7  If the readpoint is reached during a time when it is
not  possible  to  start  the  parametric  testing,  continue
cycling until it is possible to begin. Record the number
of cycles that occurred before beginning testing.
14. 8  Average the particle count information over a 10-
minute   interval.   Count   particles   for   six   10-minute
intervals.  Record  the  data  from  only  the  last  three  10-
minute intervals.
14. 9    Repeat  Sections  14.4  through  14.8  until  all  the
readpoints have been completed or until all MFCs have
experienced hard failures.
15  Data Analysis
15. 1  Calculations  —  See  Appendix  1  for  a  discussion
on reliability calculation.
15. 2  Interpretation   of   Results   —   The   readpoints
included  in  Table  1  are  approximately  equidistant  on  a
log  scale,  and  as  data  is  collected,  the  number  of
readpoints needed to show trends and estimate life will
decrease significantly.
16  Data Presentation
16. 1    Plot  each  performance  measure  over  number  of
cycles to look for trends and shifts as a function of use
(see   Figure   3).   This   gives   a   picture   of   dynamic
performance vs. use.

16. 2    Record  time  to  failure  and  plot  failure  times  on  lognormal  or  Weibull  probability  scales  (see  Figure  4).  This
plot gives an estimate of the useful life of an MFC (see Sections A1-1.1.4 – A1-1.1.5). Record data for the parameter

APPENDIX 1
RELIABILITY ANALYSIS
NOTICE: This appendix was approved as an official part of SEMI E67 by full letter ballot procedure.
NOTE 1: The method for reliability analysis provided herein is one of many possible methods which may be used. It is up to the
user to determine if this method or another (e.g., Weibull) is to be used for determination of MFC reliability.
A1-1  Reliability Analysis
A1-1.1    Almost  all  reliability  studies  of  entities  whose  failure  is  unplanned,  focus  on  the  time  until  a  small
percentage has failed (time until 10% of the population has failed, for example). Focus is on the left tail of the time-
to-failure probability distribution. Nelson’s book, Applied Life Data Analysis, (Wiley, 1982) gives a simple method
for  estimating  the  time  to  10%  failure  for  a  lognormal  distribution  (n  =  2  to  10)  from  units  put  on  test.  Table  A1
(from page 272 of Nelson’s book) can be used as follows:
A1-1.1.1  Calculate the % failed from the following equation:
Plot % failed vs. # cycles to failure for each MFC that failed on lognormal probability paper (see Figure 4).
A1-1.1.2  Estimate the mean, μ*, and the standard deviation, σ*, from the plot with the following equations:
A1-1.1.3  Calculate a 90% lower confidence limit for the (log of) 10% failure percentile (y
10
,
lcl
) from the following
equations:
y* = LOG (y
10, lcl
)=μ*+ t* [δ= 0.10,  P = 0.10, n =#  tested,r=#  failed]×σ*
where t *  is found from Applied Life Data Analysis,  Table A1

The % failed column was calculated from the equation in Section A1-1.1.1.

A1-1.1.5  See Figure 4 for a plot of this data.
A1-1.1.6  Use Figure 4 to calculate μ* and σ*.

TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING WARM-UP TIME OF MASS FLOW
CONTROLLERS
This test method was technically reapproved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Gases  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North  American  Regional
Standards  Committee  on  July  27,  2003.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  October  2003;  to  be  published
November 2003.  Originally published September 1997.
1  Purpose
1. 1      The   purpose   of   this   method   is   to   provide   a
standardized  method  for  quantifying  the  warm-up  time
of an MFC.
NOTE  1:    Warm-up  times  affect  the  initial  performance  of  a
mass  flow  controller  (MFC).  Warm-up  time  is  necessary
information  in  deciding  if  a  process  tool  is  ready  to  be  put
back into service. In addition, warm-up data will be useful in
calibration labs.
2  Scope
2. 1    The  test  conditions  in  this  method  are  intended  to
simulate  bench  top  warm-up,  with  an  MFC  that  has
been  equalized  to  ambient  conditions  for  24  hours
before the application of power.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1      Conditions   in   the   lab   may   be   different   from
conditions  found  in  the  field  and  may  influence  test
results. This test is intended to measure warm-up under
a controlled condition.
3. 2    The  MFC  is  to  be  at  ambient  temperature  before
the beginning of the test.
3. 3    Due  to  manufacturing  variability,  warm-up  times
may    vary    for    the    same    model    of    MFC.    This
specification  addresses  a  method  for  taking  a  single
data  point  repetitively  from  the  same  MFC.  Resulting
data will show exactly how warm-up effects change the
delivered  flow  of  that  particular  MFC.  To  statistically
quantify  warm-up  time  for  a  particular  model  of  MFC,
multiple samples should be tested.

5  Terminology
5. 1  Abbreviations and Acronyms
5. 1.1  DUT — Device under test
5. 1.2  FS — Full scale
5. 1.3  MFC — Mass flow controller
5. 2  Definitions
5. 2.1  device  under  test  —  the  MFC  being  tested  for
warm-up time.
5. 2.2  indicated  flow  —  flow  indicated  by  the  MFC
under test. Electrical output of the DUT.
5. 2.3  stability — a condition that exhibits only natural,
random    variations    in    the    absence    of    unnatural,
assignable-cause variations. For the several purposes of
this test, stability is defined as ±10% of the accuracy of
the DUT at full scale.
5. 2.4  steady  state  —  state  at  which  the  indicated  flow
is stable for a 15-minute time period.
5. 2.5  warm-up — a process where the MFC goes from
an unpowered condition to a condition where the output
is within ±1% full scale, of the final steady state output.
6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1      The   DUT   is   connected   in   series   with   shut-off
valves on either side of the DUT. With no gas flow and
the  DUT  powered,  indicated  flow  is  monitored  until
steady  state  is  achieved.  Power  is  briefly  disconnected
then reconnected and indicated flow is again monitored
until steady state is achieved.
7  Significance and Use
7. 1    Data  generated  by  this  method  is  used  to  estimate
the amount of time an MFC should be powered up in a
process    tool    before    resuming    production.    When
calibrating  an  MFC,  the  warm-up  time  can  be  used  to
estimate the waiting time before calibration. For power
interruptions, the power interruption warm-up time may
be  used  to  determine  the  time  required  following  a
power interruption to resume production or calibration.

8  Apparatus
8. 1  See Figure 1.

Figure 1
Test Set Up
8. 2  Time-Keeping   Apparatus  —  Capable  of  keeping  accurate  records   within   ±   10   seconds.   Time-keeping
requirements are not stringent, and almost any apparatus is acceptable.
8. 3  Data Acquisition System — Having a resolution of one mV or better and a sample rate of one Hz.
9  Conditioning
9. 1    Ambient  temperature  must  be  controlled  and  stable  between  20°C  and  25°C  during  testing  for  all  tests.  The
DUT  must  be  exposed  to  the  ambient  environment  for  24  hours  before  the  beginning  of  the  test  so  that  it  is  in
equilibrium.  The  gas  temperature  must  be  measured  and  verified  to  be  at  equilibrium  with  both  the  DUT  and  with
ambient temperature. Temperatures are in equilibrium if they are within 1°C of each other. Lab temperature may not
change more than 1°C during test.
10  Procedure
10. 1  Connect the DUT in series with the two shut-off valves, one upstream of the DUT and the other downstream.
Electronically connect the DUT to a data acquisition system capable of recording indicated flow from the DUT.  The
test set-up should be set to give appropriate signals to the DUT so the DUT control valve will not dissipate power.
For  normally  closed  MFC’s,  the  setpoint  should  be  zero,  and  for  normally  open  MFC’s,  the  setpoint  should  be
100%.  Suggested  orientation  of  the  DUT  is  horizontal  (base  down).  If  the  DUT  is  positioned  otherwise,  the
orientation should be reported in the test data (see Figure 1). Valves are to be opened in a downstream-to-upstream
sequence and closed in reverse fashion. The data acquisition system must be warmed up as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
10. 2  Close shut-off valves.
10. 3    In  Table  1,  record  the  time  of  day  when  power  was  applied  to  the  DUT.  Begin  recording  the  indicated  flow
from the DUT at one sample per second.

while disconnecting power from the test unit for 120 ±
10  seconds.  Reconnect  power  to  the  DUT  and  monitor
indicated flow until steady state is again achieved.

TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING REPRODUCIBILITY AND ZERO
DRIFT FOR THERMAL MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS
This test method was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility of
the North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards
Committee on July 27, 2003.  Initially available at www.semi.org October 2003; to be published November
2003.  Originally published February 1998.
1  Purpose
1. 1    The  purpose  of  this  document  is  to  provide  a
standardized method to quantify the reproducibility and
zero drift of a thermal mass flow controller.
1. 2    The  intent  of  this  document  is  not  to  suggest  any
specific  testing  program  but  to  specify  the  test  method
to be used when testing for parameters that are covered
by  this  method.  The  user  might  use  this  document  to
check  significant  performance  characteristics,  such  as
reproducibility  and  zero  drift,  under  a  set  of  closely
controlled test conditions.
1. 3  The significance of the accuracy calculations in this
method  is  to  allow  an  MFC  user  to  transfer  a  process
from   one   manufacturing   tool   to   another   and   to
exchange  MFCs  within  a  single  manufacturing  tool
while maintaining process control.
2  Scope
2. 1        This    document    describes    the    conditions    and
procedures for testing the reproducibility and zero drift
of  thermal  mass  flow  controllers  (MFCs).  Because  of
the   generic   nature   of   this   document,   not   all   test
procedures apply to all types of MFCs.
2. 2      This   document   provides   a   common   basis   for
communication between manufacturers and users.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1  It is not practical to evaluate performance under all
possible combinations of operating conditions. This test
procedure    should    be    applied    under    laboratory
conditions; its intent is to collect sufficient data to form
a judgement of the field performance of the MFC being
tested.

6  Summary of Test Method
6. 1    Specific  procedures  are  given  for  characterizing
MFCs  discharging  to  atmospheric  pressure  or  into  a
vacuum    using    accepted    reference    standards    to
determine reproducibility and zero drift (see Figure 2).

7. 1    The  accuracy  rating  of  the  measuring  equipment
must     include     superior     measurement     capability
compared  with  that  of  the  DUT.  In  no  instance  should
the accuracy rating of the measuring equipment be less
than twice that of the  DUT  (e.g.,  if  the  accuracy  of  the
DUT  is  ±  1  sccm,  then  the  accuracy  of  the  measuring
device  must  be  better  than,  or  equal  to,  ±  1/2  sccm).
The    traceability    of    all    the    pertinent    measuring
instruments    and    devices    should    be    realistically
established and quantified.
7. 1.1  In addition, take care when using test instruments
with  a  specified  accuracy  expressed  in  percent  of  full
scale.  For  example,  if  an  instrument  with  a  specified
accuracy of ± 0.1% of full scale is used to measure the
output  of  the  DUT,  but  this  output  signal  falls  only
within the lower third of the scale of the instrument, the
effective  accuracy  over  the  range  of  the  instrument
being  used  may  be  ±  0.3%,  which  is  unsuitable  for
many applications.
7. 1.2    Use  special  precautions  to  ensure  that  minimum
effects   result   from   pneumatic   noise   in   flow   lines.
Monitor pressure both upstream and downstream of the
MFC to ensure that pneumatic noise is minimized.
7. 1.3    The  DUT  should  be  installed  so  that  the  inlet
flow  can  be  fully  developed,  pulsation-free,  for  the
specific conditions. This can be achieved by plumbing a
straight length of tubing 40ñ50 diameters long upstream
and    another    straight    length    5    diameters    long
downstream  of  the  DUT.  (For  additional  information
about inlet effects, refer to ASME MFC-1M.)
7. 1.4    At  regular  calibration  intervals,  verify  electrical
signals  directly  at  the  MFC  connector  to  ensure  that
there are no unacceptable line losses in the cables.

9  Precautions
9. 1  Technical Precautions
9. 1.1    Many  analog-to-digital  converter  cards  do  not
differentiate  between  measurements  of  less  than  zero
and zero. It may be necessary to use a digital voltmeter
to  record  measurements  below  zero  volts.  Some  MFCs
do not differentiate between measurements of less than
zero and zero. This may bias the results.
9. 1.2  The manufacturerís       specifications       and
instructions   for   installation   and   operation   must   be
applied during all testing.
9. 1.3  All  electrical  measurements  should  be  read  on
devices  with  at  least  4.5  digits  of  resolution.  These
devices must have valid calibration certifications.
9. 1.4    The  mounting  position  of  the  device  must  be  in
accordance  with  the  manufacturerís  specifications.  No
external      mechanical      constraints      beyond      the
manufacturerís  recommended  mounting  position  shall
be permitted.
10  Preparation of Apparatus
10. 1    Figure  3  is  a  representation  of  a  recommended
generic  testing  apparatus.  The  flow  standard  is  shown
downstream  of  the  device  under  test  (DUT).  It  may  be
placed upstream of the DUT if the flow standard cannot
be exposed to a low pressure environment. In this case,
the  user  should  be  aware  of  possible  back  pressure
effects on the flow standard.

11  Calibration Standardization
11. 1        All    measurement    devices    must    have    valid
calibration certificates.
12  Conditioning
12. 1      Place   the   MFC   to   be   tested   in   the   testing
environment. Apply power to the MFC for the 24 hours
prior    to    initiating    warm-up    as    defined    by    the
manufacturer.  The  valve  should  be  in  its  ìoffî  position
(closed for an NC valve, open for an NO valve).
12. 2      Following   the   conditioning   period,   install   and
warm   up   the   device   according   to   manufacturerís
specifications.
12. 3    Purge  the  MFC  with  nitrogen  or  argon  following
the warm up period.
12. 4  Allow the test gas to flow through the DUT for a
minimum of 10 minutes at 100% of flow.
12. 5  Apply a 100% full-scale setpoint to the DUT and
wait for the flow to stabilize for 10 seconds. Apply the
lower setpoint limit to the DUT and wait for the flow to
stabilize  for  10  seconds.  Repeat  this  cycle  two  more
times.   This   process   exercises   the   device   before
initiating the test.
12. 6  Test Conditions
12. 6.1    The  reference  operating  conditions  shall  be  as
follows if the downstream pressure is atmospheric:
Ambient temperature 23 ± 2∞C
Gas temperature Same as actual ambient
Ambient pressure 101.3 kPa (+ 4.7 or − 15.3 kPa)
Gas pressure P

12. 7  Power Supply Conditions
12. 7.1    The  reference  power  supply  conditions  used
shall    be    the    reference    values    specified    by    the
manufacturer.  For  those  instances  when  a  range  of
values  is  specified  rather  than  a  reference  value,  the
midpoint of the range shall be taken to be the reference
value.



SEMI E69-0298 © SEMI 1998, 2003 7
12. 7.2  The reference power supply must be sufficiently
rated  for  the  DUT.  In  addition,  the  following  supply
conditions and tolerances shall apply:
DC supply reference voltage ± 0.1% of operating voltage
Noise and ripple of DC supply ≤ 0.1% rms

13  Procedure
13. 1  Zero Offset
13. 1.1    Close  the  gas  shut-off  valve  upstream  of  the
device under test and apply a 100% setpoint to the DUT
to equilibrate the pressure across the MFC. Wait for the
flow  to  stabilize  at  a  value  near  zero,  then  close  the
downstream   shut-off   valve.   Deactivate   the   MFCís
control  valve  (open  for  (NO)  valves,  closed  for  (NC)
valves),  and  disable  the  MFC  to  auto  zero  if  an  auto-
zero  disable  option  is  available.  After  the  electrical
output  signal  has  stabilized  for  at  least  three  minutes,
record  the  MFC  zero  offset  on  Table  1.  (Consult  the
manufacturerís  specifications  for  the  stabilization  time
and report this time on Table 2.)

13. 1.2      Use   the   cardinal   setpoints   and   any   other
setpoints  of  specific  interest.  These  setpoints  will  be
used  to  determine  the  reproducibility  of  the  MFC.  The
setpoint    increments    should    exceed    the    expected
deadband of the DUT.
13. 1.3    At  each  setpoint  under  test,  maintain  the  input
signal until the output of the DUT becomes stabilized at
its  apparent  final  value.  Observe  and  record  the  output
values in Table 1 for each input value.
13. 1.4  Record  five  readings  at  each  setpoint  during
testing.
NOTE  2:    If  the  data  points  show  a  trend  in  one  direction,
either up or down, the DUT is not stable enough for the test to
proceed  to  the  next  setpoint.  Record  another  five  readings  at
this setpoint. If the results continue to show a trend, repeat the
measurements  at  the  previous  setpoint.  If  the  results  are  not
satisfactory  at  this  setpoint,  stop  the  test  for  this  MFC.  If  the
results   are   not   satisfactory,   halt   the   test   and   verify   the
performance of the testing apparatus.
13. 1.5    At  each  point  under  test,  maintain  the  input
signal until the output of the device under test becomes
stabilized   at   its   apparent   final   value.   Observe   and
record the output values for each input value.
13. 2  Reproducibility and Zero Drift Test
13. 2.1    Apply  a  50%  setpoint  to  the  MFC  and  record
data.
13. 2.2  Move the setpoint to 100% and record data.
13. 2.3  Move the setpoint to 50% and record data.
13. 2.4  Move the setpoint to 10% and record data.
13. 2.5      After   recording   data   at   10%,   apply   a   5%
setpoint  for  10  minutes,  but  do  not  record  any  data  at
this setpoint.
13. 2.6    Move  the  setpoint  back  up  to  10%  and  record
data.



SEMI E69-0298 © SEMI 1998, 2003 9
13. 3  Repeat Sections 13.2.1ñ13.2.6, for a total of three
times, until at least six sets of data have been collected
at each setpoint (with the exception of 100%).
13. 4    Repeat  Sections  13.1.1ñ13.3  weekly  for  a  period
of  at  least  12  weeks.  During  the  idle  time,  the  MFC
should  be  continuously  powered,  with  any  exceptions
so noted. Gas flow is not required during the idle time,
but  any  gas  flow  shall  be  recorded.  Finally,  record  all
details about the conditions of the MFC during the idle
time.

materials       are       identified       and       prepurchased.
Prefacilitation is performed to insure accurate and quick
hookup of tool on arrival.
7. 1.10  Customer Source Inspects Equipment — Source
inspection  is  the  final  validation  of  all  designs  and
capabilities  of  the  specific  tool.  Functionality  testing  is
performed  and  documented.  Physical  configuration  is
confirmed.     Modifications     to     configurations     are
documented so that installation pricing can be adjusted
accordingly.
7. 1.11  Supplier   Ships   Equipment   to   Customer   —
Equipment is packaged per SEMI E49.1 and shipped as
defined   in   SEMI   E6.   Equipment   is   shipped   per
purchase   order   stipulations.   Customs   clearance   is
obtained as required.
7. 1.12  Customer  Verifies  Equipment  Matches  Supplier
Provided  Facilities  Interface  Specification  —  Upon
arrival  at  the  customer  site,  verification  of  compliance
to   purchase   order   is   determined.   Verification   of
physical dimensions, point of connections, and interface
cabling and tubing is performed.
7. 1.13  Equipment Hookup by Customer — Mechanical,
electrical,   process   piping,   and   life   safety   system
hookups   are   done,   and   all   functional   testing   is
completed.  Equipment  is  ready  for  vendor  startup  and
commissioning.  Final  payment  to  hookup  contractor  is
authorized,  and  upon  payment,  construction  liens  are
released.  As-built  drawings  showing  newly  installed
tool are updated and submitted to owner for inclusion in
permanent records.
7. 1.14  Equipment  Is  Qualified  and  Customer  Verifies
Contract Completion — Equipment startup is complete
and functional testing to verify compliance to purchase
agreement is complete and documented. Final payment
to equipment vendor is released.
7. 1.15  Actual  Cost  and  Schedules  Are  Reviewed  —
Final accounting is performed to determine actual costs
associated   with   the   project.   Actual   duration   of   all
activities is compared to original schedule to determine
areas  for  improvement.  Estimating  models  for  future
installations are updated to reflect new information.

SEMI E72-0600 (Reapproved 0305)
SPECIFICATION AND GUIDE FOR 300 mm EQUIPMENT FOOTPRINT,
HEIGHT, AND WEIGHT
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Physical  Interfaces  &  Carriers  Committee  and  is
the  direct  responsibility  of  the  North  American  Physical  Interfaces  &  Carriers  Committee.  Current  edition
approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on December 10, 2004.  Initially available
at  www.semi.org  February  2005;  to  be  published  March  2005.  Originally  published  in  1998,  previously
published June 2000.
1  Purpose
1. 1  Currently,  device  manufacturers  cannot  easily  plan  or  retrofit  their  fabs,  because  equipment  volumes  are  not
predictable. Similarly, equipment suppliers cannot predict fab designs, because there are too many configurations. In
general,  fab  space  is  not  used  efficiently,  and  there  seems  to  be  a  trade-off  between  space  efficiency  and
maintainability. This standard is a guide for equipment design and a specification for maximum limits on equipment
volume and weight.
2  Scope
2. 1  This standard specifies limits on the footprint, height, and weight of equipment for 300 mm fabs. Separate limits
are  given  for  the  parts  of  the  equipment  in  the  main  fab  and  in  the  sub-fab.  Separate  limits  are  also  given  for  the
equipment  after  it  is  installed  and  for  the  components  of  the  equipment  as  it  is  moved  into  the  fab.  The  actual
footprint may vary by equipment type.
2. 2  This  standard  is  intended  to  set  an  appropriate  level  of  specification  that  places  minimal  limits  on  supplier
innovation  while  ensuring  opportunities  for  users  to  be  globally  (though  possibly  not  locally)  efficient  with
equipment volumes.
2. 3  This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of
the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the  applicability  of
regulatory limitations prior to use.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.

NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.
4  Terminology
4. 1  Definitions
4. 1.1  cost footprint — the area (A) of the smallest horizontal rectangle that contains all of the shadow footprint and
half  of  the  easement  space  around  the  equipment  (for  use  as  the  floor  space  metric  in  Cost  of  Ownership
calculations). As shown in Figure 1, this is computed as
A = [Wt + ½ (Ws – Wt)] × [Dt + ½ (Ds – Dt)]
= ¼ (Wt + Ws) × (Dt + Ds)
Where W represents width and D represents depth


SEMI E72-0600 © SEMI 2003 2
4. 1.2  depth — the horizontal dimension perpendicular to the load face plane.
4. 1.3  easement  space  —  the  floor  space  that  must  remain  clear  to  the  rear  and  sides  of  the  equipment  (but  not  in
front of the load face plane). This includes safety aisles, ergonomic maintenance access space, component removal
space, and room for doors to swing out (see Figure 1).
4. 1.4  load face plane — the furthest physical vertical boundary plane from the cassette centroid or carrier centroid
on the side (or sides) of the tool where loading of the tool is intended (as defined in SEMI E15).
4. 1.5  shadow footprint — the area of the floor space directly under every part of the equipment during its operation
(see  Figure  1).  This  includes  any  temporary  projections  from  the  equipment  during  loading  or  processing  (such  as
carriers that stick out from the equipment or equipment load ports that protrude only when the equipment is being
loaded).
4. 1.6  width — the horizontal dimension parallel to the load face plane.
5  Requirements and Recommendations
NOTE 1:  The dimensions cited in the following sections are specified in Table 1.
5. 1  Sub-Fab vs. Main Fab Footprint
5. 1.1  Requirements — Both the cost footprint and the shadow footprint of the remote parts of any equipment in the
sub-fab must be less than or equal to the cost footprint and the shadow footprint (respectively) of the parts of that
equipment in the main fab (the cleanroom including both bays and chases, if any). Furthermore, the remote parts of
the equipment in the sub-fab must be capable of being installed so that the rectangle defining the cost footprint in the
sub-fab is entirely underneath the rectangle defining the cost footprint in the main fab. In some fab designs (such as
slab on grade), there is no sub-fab (or basement). In such cases, these requirements apply to the remote parts of the
equipment in whichever equipment support area contains the same remote parts of the equipment as a sub-fab. Also,
some fabs have multiple sub-fab levels. In such cases, these requirements apply to the remote parts of the equipment
in all sub-fab levels.
5. 1.2  Recommendations — Since the sub-fab is likely to have more columns than the main fab, it is recommended
that  the  remote  parts  of  the  equipment  in  the  sub-fab  come  in  modules  that  can  be  arranged  to  accommodate  a
variety of layouts.
5. 2  Equipment Height
5. 2.1  Requirements — The maximum height of any equipment (other than a stocker) must be less than or equal to H
in the main fab and Hs in the sub-fab. Any connections for utilities and required overhead mainten-ance access must
also be included within these limits. These limits also apply during installation, so if a part of the equipment must be
rotated up into place, the diagonal measurement must be less than these limits.
5. 2.2  Recommendations — Thus, equipment suppliers are advised to not plan on ceilings higher than these limits.
5. 3  Floor Loading
5. 3.1  Requirements — The maximum mass of any equipment in the main fab divided by its shadow footprint must
be less than or equal to M (except when support pedestals are used). Furthermore, the maximum weight on any 0.6
m by 0.6 m (2 ft. by 2 ft.) floor tile (in any installation configuration) must be less than or equal to Mt. These limits
also apply when the equipment is being moved into the fab and installed, unless spreader plates are used.
5. 3.2  Recommendations  —  It  is  recommended  that  seismic  loading  also  be  considered  when  designing  equipment
weight distribution.
5. 4  Move-In-Size
5. 4.1  Requirements — To clarify the size of the doors and hallways needed in the fab, this paragraph specifies the
size of the equipment's components after it has been uncrated, while it is being moved into the fab, and before it is
installed. All parts of the equipment destined for the main fab must come in packages that are no taller than Z and
that  are  smaller  than  X  by  Y  in  two  orthogonal  horizontal  dimensions.  All  parts  of  the  equipment  destined  for  the
sub-fab  must  come  in  packages  that  are  no  taller  than  Zs  and  that  are  smaller  than  Xs  by  Ys  in  two  orthogonal
