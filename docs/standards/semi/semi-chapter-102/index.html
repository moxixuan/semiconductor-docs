SEMI M20-1104
PRACTICE FOR ESTABLISHING A WAFER COORDINATE SYSTEM
This   practice   was   technically   approved   by   the   Global   Silicon   Wafer   Committee   and   is   the   direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  16,  2004.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>
September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.    Originally  published  in  1991;  previously  published  in</p><h1>2004</h1><ol start="2004"><li>1  Purpose</li><li>1  Processing  systems  now  employed  in  advanced
device   manufacturing   use   aligning   mechanisms   to
position  the  wafer  rotationally  and  in  x-y  prior  to
processing.    Many  of  these  scan  the  wafer  periphery
and   determine   the   geometric   center   of   the   wafer
surface.  This is most often seen on stepping aligners, to
minimize    the    effects    of    wafer-to-wafer    diameter
variation  in  mixed  aligner  type  fabs.    Similar  center-
referencing     subsystems     are     found     on     many
characterization systems.  The wafer coordinate system
provides a method for referencing any other coordinate
system, such as a site, pattern, or mapping array, to the
physical geometry of the wafer surface.</li><li>2  If the points of the array lie on the front surface of
the wafer, only the x and y (or r and θ) coordinates are
relevant.      It   has   become   increasingly   important   in
semiconductor  material  and  device  manufacturing  to
describe, in unambiguous terms, the position of a point
on    a    wafer    that    automatic    processing,    test,    or
characterization  equipment  can  recognize  and  locate.
For   example,   characterization   equipment   needs   to
report  the  precise  locations  of  defects  and  anomalies
discovered in wafers before or after processing in order
to  relate  the  presence  or  absence  of  such  defects  and
anomalies   to   device   yield   variations.      The   wafer
coordinate   system   can   be   used   to   establish   the
coordinates  of  each  point  of  interest,  and,  through
transformation  to  the  yield  analysis  coordinate  system,
relate them to the die yield map.</li><li>3  In  response  to  these  needs,  this  practice  defines  a
wafer   coordinate   system   to   facilitate   the   precise
locating and reporting of points on the wafer surface.  If
the point or points lie above or below the surface, the z-
coordinate  must  also  be  used.    Because  the  zero  point
on  the  z-axis  is  application  specific,  this  practice  treats
the x-y-z  (or  r-
θ-z)  system  separately  from  the  surface
coordinate system.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This   practice   covers   procedures   for   defining   a
wafer coordinate system for locating uniquely any point
on  a  wafer  surface  using  the  wafer  center  as  the  origin
and either Cartesian (x-y) or polar (r-θ) coordinates.</li><li>2  For   unpatterned   wafers,   this   wafer   coordinate
system  can  be  used  directly  or  in  conjunction  with  a
rectangular or polar overlay array.</li><li>3  This  wafer  coordinate  system  can  also  be  used  to
locate  the  origins  or  other  reference  points  of  other
coordinate  systems  used  to  define  or  report  position
data  of  site,  die,  or  map  arrays  on  the  front  or  back
surface  of  a  patterned  or  unpatterned  wafer.    In  this
way,  the  array  coordinate  system  may  be  referenced  to
the physical geometry of the wafer.  Selected modes of
application of the wafer coordinate system are given for
information only in Related Information 1.</li><li>4  This practice also covers procedures for defining a
three-dimensional x-y-z (or r-
θ-z) coordinate system for
the wafer.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  Mask  alignment  conventions  are  not  necessarily
consistent with the wafer coordinate system.</li><li>2  In  SEMI  M1,  the  position  of  the  secondary  flat  on
silicon wafers is defined by the clockwise rotation from
the  primary  flat.    This  is  opposite  to  the  convention
used for the polar angle in the wafer coordinate system.</li><li>3  Also  in  SEMI  M1,  the  coordinate  system  for  the
edge  profile  template  is,  unlike  the  wafer  coordinate
system,  edge  referenced.    In  addition,  the  edge  profile
template  uses  the  x  coordinate  for  the  radial  direction
(positive   from   the   wafer   edge   inward)   and   the   y
coordinate  for  the  vertical  direction  (positive  from  the
wafer surface toward the median plane of the wafer).</li><li>4  In  SEMI  E5,  the  “normal”  position  of  the  wafer  is
defined similarly to that in the wafer coordinate system;
that   is,   the   primary   fiducial   is   downward   and   its
bisector is the negative y-axis.  However, the rotational
position   of   the   wafer   is   defined   by   its   clockwise
rotation  from  the  “normal”  position,  again  opposite  to
the  convention  used  for  the  polar  angle  in  the  wafer</li></ol><p>SEMI M20-1104 © SEMI 1991, 2004 2
coordinate system.  Further, in SEMI E5, the coordinate
system axes do not rotate; the wafer rotates with respect
to  these  axes.    In  the  wafer  coordinate  system,  the
coordinate   axes   are   referenced   to   the   wafer   itself,
independent  of  the  physical  position  of  the  wafer  in
space.
3. 5  SEMI  M12  and  SEMI  M13  specify  the  mark  field
location  for  100  mm,  125  mm,  or  150  mm  diameter
flatted  wafers  relative  to  the  flat  rather  than  the  wafer
center.    Thus,  the  mark  field  location  may  vary  with
respect  to  the  wafer  center  and  the  coordinates  of  the
corners   of   the   mark   field   location   (in   the   wafer
coordinate  system)  may  vary  from  wafer  to  wafer.
However,  the  mark  field  location  for  notched  wafers
150,  200,  and  300  mm  in  diameter  is  referenced  to  the
wafer center.
3. 6  There  are  some  circumstances  in  which  the  front
surface   of   an   unpatterned   wafer   is   not   readily
distinguished from the back surface.

5. 1  None.
6  Summary of Practice
6. 1  Front Surface Coordinate System
6. 1.1  The wafer is positioned with its front surface up.
6. 1.2  The wafer center is located.
6. 1.3  A  right-handed  Cartesian  coordinate  system  is
erected.
6. 1.4  The  primary  fiducial  is  located  to  be  in  the
negative y-direction.
6. 1.5  Cartesian  or  polar  coordinates  (referenced  to  the
positive x-axis)  are  chosen  according  to  the  intended
application.
6. 2  Back Surface Applications
6. 2.1  The  wafer  is  rotated  about  the  bisector  of  the
primary fiducial (y-axis) until the back surface is up.
6. 2.2  This  reverses  the  direction  of  the  x-axis,  but
otherwise  the  back  surface  coordinate  system  is  the
same as the front surface coordinate system.
6. 3  Three-dimensional Coordinate System
6. 3.1  Because    the    zero    point    on    the    z-axis    is
application  specific,  only  the  direction  of  the  z-
axis  is
defined  and  the  various  possibilities  for  locating  the
zero point are considered.
7  Procedure for Establishing Wafer
Coordinate Systems
7. 1  Front Surface Coordinate System
7. 1.1  Position the wafer front surface up.
7. 1.2  Find the center of the wafer surface.
7. 1.2.1  For purposes of this document, the periphery of
a  wafer  is  assumed  to  be  the  smallest  circle  enclosing
the  wafer,  disregarding  fiducials  and  all  other  edge
anomalies.  Use the center of this circle as the center of
the wafer surface.
7. 1.3  Erect a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system
with:
7. 1.3.1  its origin at the center of the wafer surface,
7. 1.3.2  the y-axis  on  the  diameter  in  the  plane  of  the
front surface which bisects the primary fiducial (flat or
notch), and
7. 1.3.3  the x-axis  on  the  diameter  in  the  plane  of  the
front  surface  which  is  perpendicular  to  the  bisector  of
the primary fiducial (y-axis).
7. 1.4  Orient the wafer so the primary fiducial is in the
negative y-direction (see Figure 1).
7. 1.5  Take as the usual convention that the negative y-
direction  is  pointing  downward  (on  a  page)  or  toward
the operator (on a table or chuck or in a wafer carrier),
and that the positive x-axis points toward the right.
7. 1.6  Reference  the  polar  coordinates,  r  and  θ  to  the
positive x-axis where
22
yxr+= (see Figure 1).
7. 1.7  Choose  Cartesian  or  polar  coordinates  according
to the application.
7. 2  Back Surface Coordinates
7. 2.1  Rotate   the   wafer   around   the   bisector   of   the
primary fiducial (y-axis) until the back surface is up.</p><p>SEMI M20-1104 © SEMI 1991, 2004 3</p><p>x

Front Surface Coordinate System</p><ol start="7"><li>2.2  With   the   primary   fiducial   in   the   negative   y
direction   (downward   or   toward   the   operator),   the
positive x-axis points toward the left.  In this way the x-
y-coordinates  of  a  point  on  the  back  surface  are  the
same as the x-y coordinates of the point directly through
the wafer on the front surface.</li><li>3  Three-dimensional Coordinates</li><li>3.1  Place the wafer with the front surface up.</li><li>3.2  Erect  the  z-axis  through  the  center  of  the  wafer
surface  and  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of  the  surface
with  the  positive  direction  above  the  front  surface  (see
Figure 2).</li><li>3.3  Assign the zero point of the z-axis in accordance
with the application.</li><li>3.3.1  For   example,   for   geometric   measurements,
such  as  warp,  the  center  of  the  z-axis  may  be  at  the
geometrical center of the wafer in three dimensions.</li><li>3.3.2  For  front  surface  flatness  measurements,  the
zero point of the z-axis is usually taken at the reference
plane, which is chosen in accordance with the particular
flatness parameter being determined.</li><li>3.3.3  Other  applications  may  require  locating  the
center of the z-axis at a different position.</li><li>3.3.4  For      thickness      or      thickness      variation
measurements, the zero point of the z-axis may be taken
at the center of the back surface of the wafer.</li></ol><p>NOTE: The primary fiducial may be a flat or a notch.

development  of  the  document.    This  related  information  was  approved  for  publication  by  full  letter  ballot
procedures.</p><p>R1-1   SEMI  E5,  in  Stream  12  —  Wafer  Mapping,  delineates  how  a  coordinate  system  for  reporting  position  data
may be communicated.  The origin of this coordinate system, which is specified by the equipment when generating
the wafer map, may be the site at any of the four corners of the array or at the array center.  In addition, the stream
provides  for  transmission  of  an  arbitrary  number  of  reference  points  to  relate  the  map  coordinate  system  to  the
physical wafer.  The wafer coordinate system may be used to establish the locations of these reference points and of
the origin of the map coordinate system.
R1-2 SEMI M17 defines a polar array of 1000 elements which can be used to identify the locations on a wafer of
extended defects such as slip.  This array is consistent with the wafer coordinate system.</p><p>NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for any

GUIDE FOR ASSIGNING ADDRESSES TO RECTANGULAR ELEMENTS
IN A CARTESIAN ARRAY
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional
Standards  Committee  on  October  16,  2003.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  February  2004;  to  be
published March 2004. Originally published in 1992; last published September 1998.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1    It  is  frequently  very  useful  to  have  a  standardized
method  for  labeling  elements  in  an  array  on  a  silicon
wafer surface.</li><li>2    This  guide  defines  an  element  addressing  conven-
tion  for  locating  and  uniquely  identifying  rectangular
elements in a Cartesian array.</li><li>3    Such  arrays  are  useful  in  locating  sites  for  site
flatness characterization, defect mapping, determination
of    parametric    distributions,    etc.    on    unpatterned
semiconductor wafers.
2  Scope</li><li>1        This    guide    covers    procedures    for    assigning
addresses   that   can   be   used   to   locate   and   identify
rectangular  elements  in  a  Cartesian  array.  The  array
may be regular or tiled in one direction.</li><li>2    Relating  the  position  of  the  array  to  the  wafer
surface is outside the scope of this guide, but it may be
established through use of the wafer coordinate system
defined in SEMI M20.</li><li>3      This   guide   covers   procedures   for   assigning   a
unique  identification  (address)  for  each  element  in  the
array.  An example of the results obtained by following
this procedure are given in Related Information 1.</li><li>4    The  element  addressing  convention  in  this  guide
provides  an  orderly  progression  along  perpendicular
directions  with  addresses  of  adjacent  elements  in  any
direction  differing  by  1.  Consequently,  distances  may
be calculated in a unified way.</li><li>5    For  complex  patterns,  more  than  one  array  on  a
wafer   may   be   defined   and   related   to   the   same
coordinate axes.</li><li>6  The element addressing convention in this guide is
consistent with that of the polar array specified in SEMI
M17.  In  addition,  element  addresses  can  be  readily
transformed  to  addresses  in  other  types  of  addressing
conventions for Cartesian arrays as described in Related
Information 2.

4  Terminology</li><li>1    Many  terms  used  in  silicon  wafer  technology  are
defined in SEMI MF1241.</li><li>2    Definitions  of  additional  terms  may  be  found  in
SEMI M1, SEMI M2, or SEMI M11.
5  Array Element Layout</li><li>1    The  array  is  constructed  from  m  vertical  columns
and n   horizontal   rows   of   identical   elements   of
dimension a  horizontally  and  b  vertically.  The  number
of elements in different rows and columns may vary to
suit the application.</li><li>2  The address of an element is given by two numbers
separated   by   a   comma:   (i,j).   The   first   number,   i,
indicates the column and the second, j, the row.</li><li>3  The longest row and the longest column are used in
identifying  the  Starting  Element,  which  is  assigned  the
address (0,0).</li></ol><p>SEMI M21-0304 © SEMI 1992, 2004 2
5. 4  The array may have a tiled appearance, either with
one  or  more  rows  offset  relative  to  the  row  containing
the  Starting  Element  (row  tiling)  or  with  one  or  more
columns  offset  relative  to  the  column  containing  the
Starting Element (column tiling).
5. 4.1  For row tiling, the offset, t
r
, is a fraction (p
r
/q
r
) of
the horizontal element dimension, a, where p
r
and q
r
are
small whole numbers.
5. 4.2    For  column  tiling,  the  offset,  t
c
,  is  a  fraction
(p
c
/q
c
)  of  the  vertical  element  dimension,  b,  where  p
c</p><p>and q
c
are small whole numbers.
5. 4.3    In  either  case,  the  offset  may  be  constant  or  it
may vary from row to row or column to column. When
the offset is constant, the array pattern is repeated every
q
r
rows or q
c
columns.
6  Element Addresses
6. 1    Define  the  array  center  as  the  intersection  of  the
vertical   and   horizontal   array   centerlines,   found   as
follows:
6. 1.1  If the array is regular (not tiled):
6. 1.1.1  Count the number of elements, m, in the longest
row.
6. 1.1.2  If m is even, start at the leftmost element, count
m/2 elements to the right, and construct a line along the
right  vertical  boundary  of  this  element.  This  line  is  the
vertical array centerline (see Figure 1a).
6. 1.1.3  If m is odd, start at the leftmost element, count
the integer of m/2 elements to the right, continue to the
next  element  to  the  right,  and  construct  a  line  through
the center of this element. This line is the vertical array
centerline (see Figure 1b).
6. 1.1.4  Count the number of elements, n, in the longest
column.
6. 1.1.5  If n is even, start at the topmost element, count
down n/2  elements,  and  construct  a  line  along  the
bottom horizontal boundary of this element. This line is
the horizontal array centerline (see Figure 1c).
6. 1.1.6  If n  is  odd,  start  at  the  topmost  element,  count
down the integer of n/2 elements, continue down to the
next element, and construct a line through the center of
this element. This line is the horizontal array centerline
(see Figure 1d).
6. 1.2    If  the  columns  of  the  array  are  tiled  (see  Figure
2a):
6. 1.2.1  Count the number of columns, m, in the widest
part of the array from left to right.
6. 1.2.2  If m is even, start at the leftmost column, count
m/2 columns to the right, and construct a line along the
right  vertical  boundary  of  this  column.  This  line  is  the
vertical array centerline.
6. 1.2.3  If m  is  odd,  start  at  the  leftmost  column,  count
the integer of m/2 columns to the right, continue to the
next  column  to  the  right,  and  construct  a  line  through
the center of this column. This line is the vertical array
centerline.
6. 1.2.4      Count   the   number   of   elements,   n
′,   in   the
column which contains or is immediately to the right of
the vertical array centerline, depending on whether m is
odd or even, respectively.
NOTE 1:  The number, n′, is usually equal to but may be less
than n.
6. 1.2.5  If n′ is even, start at the topmost element, count
down n
′/2  elements,  and  construct  a  line  along  the
bottom horizontal boundary of this element. This line is
the horizontal array centerline.
6. 1.2.6  If n
′ is odd, start at the topmost element, count
down the integer of n
′/2 elements, continue down to the
next element, and construct a line through the center of
this element. This line is the horizontal array centerline.
6. 1.3  If the rows of the array are tiled (see Figure 2b):
6. 1.3.1  Count the number of rows, n, in the widest part
of the array from top to bottom.
6. 1.3.2  If n  is  even,  start  at  the  topmost  row,  count
down n/2  rows,  and  construct  a  line  along  the  bottom
horizontal   boundary   of   this   row.   This   line   is   the
horizontal array centerline (see Figure 1c).
6. 1.3.3  If n is odd, start at the topmost row, count down
the integer of n/2 rows, continue down to the next row,
and construct a line through the center of this row. This
line is the horizontal array centerline (see Figure 1d).
6. 1.3.4    Count  the  number  of  elements,  m
′,  in  the  row
which  contains  or  is  immediately  above  the  vertical
array  centerline,  depending  on  whether  n  is  odd  or
even, respectively.
NOTE 2:  The number, m′, is usually equal to but may be less
than m.
6. 1.3.5  If m′  is  even,  start  at  the  leftmost  element,
count m
′/2  elements  to  the  right,  and  construct  a  line
along  the  right  vertical  boundary  of  this  element.  This
line is the vertical array centerline.
6. 1.3.6  If m
′ is odd, start at the leftmost element, count
the integer of m
′/2 elements to the right, continue to the
next  element  to  the  right,  and  construct  a  line  through
the center of this element. This line is the vertical array
centerline.</p><p>SEMI M21-0304 © SEMI 1992, 2004 3
6. 2  Locate the Starting Element (0,0) as follows:
6. 2.1      If   the   array   center   falls   within   an   element,
designate  that  element  as  the  Starting  Element  (see
Figure 3a).
6. 2.2    If  the  array  is  regular  and  the  array  center  lies  at
an  element  corner,  designate  the  element  to  the  right
and  immediately  above  the  array  center  as  the  Starting
Element (see Figure 3b).
6. 2.3  If the array is regular and the array center lies on
a  vertical  element  boundary,  designate  as  the  Starting
Element  that  element  which  contains  the  horizontal
array  centerline  and  is  immediately  to  the  right  of  the
vertical array centerline (see Figure 3c).
6. 2.4  If the array is regular and the array center lies on
a horizontal element boundary, designate as the Starting
Element  that  element  which  contains  the  vertical  array
centerline   and   is   immediately   above   the   horizontal
array centerline (see Figure 3d).
6. 2.5    If  columns  of  the  array  are  tiled  and  the  array
center  lies  on  a  vertical  boundary  between  columns,
designate  that  element  immediately  to  the  right  of  the
vertical  centerline  and  containing  the  horizontal  array
centerline  as  the  Starting  Element.  If  the  horizontal
array centerline also falls on an element boundary in the
column  immediately  to  the  right  of  the  vertical  array
centerline,  designate  the  element  in  this  column  and
immediately above the horizontal array centerline as the
Starting Element (see Figure 4a).
6. 2.6  If rows of the array are tiled and the array center
lies  on  a  horizontal  boundary  between  rows,  designate
that  element  immediately  above  the  horizontal  array
centerline and containing the vertical array centerline as
the Starting Element. If the vertical array centerline also
falls  on  an  element  boundary  in  the  row  immediately
above  the  horizontal  array  centerline,  designate  the
element in this row and immediately to the right of the
vertical  array  centerline  as  the  Starting  Element  (see
Figure 4b).
6. 3  Assign addresses to the array elements as follows:
6. 3.1  Elements along the horizontal array centerline:
6. 3.1.1  If the horizontal array centerline passes through
an element, assign that element the address (i,0), where
i is the column number. The first column to the right of
the  vertical  array  centerline  is  numbered  1,  the  next
column  to  the  right  is  numbered  2,  the  next  column  to
the right is numbered 3, etc. Similarly, the first column
to the left of the vertical array centerline is numbered -
1,  the  next  column  to  the  left  is  numbered  -2,  the  next
column to the left is numbered -3, etc. (see Figure 3a).
6. 3.1.2    If  the  horizontal  array  centerline  falls  along  an
element  boundary  in  any  column,  i,  assign  the  address
(i,0)   to   the   element   in   that   column   which   lies
immediately  above  the  horizontal  array  centerline  (see
Figure 3b).
6. 3.2  Elements along the vertical array centerline:
6. 3.2.1  If the vertical array centerline passes through an
element, assign that element the address (0,j), where j is
the  row  number.  The  first  row  above  the  horizontal
array  centerline  is  numbered  1,  the  next  row  up  is
numbered  2,  the  next  row  up  is  numbered  3,  etc.
Similarly   the   first   row   below   the   horizontal   array
centerline   is   numbered   -1,   the   next   row   down   is
numbered  -2,  the  next  row  down  is  numbered  -3,  etc.
(see Figure 3a).
6. 3.2.2    If  the  vertical  array  centerline  falls  along  an
element boundary in any row, j, assign the address (0,j)
to the element in that row which lies immediately to the
right of the vertical array centerline (see Figure 3b).
6. 3.3  Remaining elements:
6. 3.3.1  Assign addresses (i,j) to the remaining elements
based  on  their  position  relative  to  the  elements  along
the   horizontal   and   vertical   array   centerlines.   For
example the address of the element immediately above
(1,0)  is  (1,1)  and  the  element  immediately  below  (1,0)
is (1,-1) (see Figure 5).</p><p>SEMI M21-0304 © SEMI 1992, 2004 4</p><p>Figure 1

EXTENSIONS TO OTHER ELEMENT ADDRESSING CONVENTIONS
NOTICE: This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of  SEMI  M21.    It  was  developed  during  the
original  development  of  the  document.    This  related  information  was  approved  for  publication  by  full
letter ballot on October 16, 2003.</p><p>R2-1    Element  addressing  conventions  other  than  that
covered   by   this   guide   are   also   widely   used   in
engineering. Two of these are illustrated in Figure R2-1
with  the  use  of  the  same  truncated  array  discussed  in
Related Information 1.
R2-2  First-Quadrant Convention
R2-2.1    Addresses  in  this  convention  start  at  the  lower
left  corner  of  the  array  and  increase  to  the  right  and
upward  in  the  same  way  as  in  the  convention  covered
by  this  guide.  The  lower  left  corner  of  the  array  is
defined  by  the  intersection  of  the  bottom  boundary  of
the  lowest  row  and  the  left  boundary  of  the  leftmost
column. In the case of tiling, the boundaries are those of
the  lowest  elements  and  the  leftmost  elements  in  the
array. The lower left corner may fall outside the useful
portion of the array. The lower left element of the array
is  the  element  immediately  to  the  right  and  above  the
lower left corner of the array.
R2-2.2  The First-Quadrant Convention uses a column,
row  address  but  does  not  have  a  zero  row  or  a  zero
column.
R2-2.3  The addresses of the corners of an array with m
columns  and  n  rows  in  the  First-Quadrant  Convention
are as follows:
• lower left (Starting Element): (1,1)
• lower right: (m,1)
• upper left: (1,n)
• upper right: (m,n)
R2-2.4    The    general    formulas    for    obtaining    the
addresses  of  any  element  (i
f
,j
f
)  in  the  First-Quadrant
Convention  from  the  addresses  (i,j)  in  the  convention
covered by this guide are as follows:
i
f
= i + integer(m/2) + 1
j
f
= j + integer(n/2) + 1</p><p>R2-2.5   These   equations   also   apply   to   arrays   with
column or row tiling if n
′ = n or m′ = m, respectively. If
this condition is not met, the displacement of the row or
column  which  defines  the  array  centerline  with  respect
to   the   boundary   of   the   array   must   be   known   to
transform the addresses.
R2-3  Row, Column (Matrix) Convention
R2-3.1    Addresses  in  this  convention  start  at  the  upper
left  corner  of  the  array  and  increase  to  the  right  and
downward. The upper left corner of the array is defined
by  the  intersection  of  the  top  boundary  of  the  highest
row and the left boundary of the leftmost column. In the
case  of  tiling,  the  boundaries  are  those  of  the  highest
elements  and  the  leftmost  elements  in  the  array.  The
upper  left  corner  may  fall  outside  the  useful  portion  of
the  array.  The  upper  left  element  of  the  array  is  the
element  immediately  to  the  right  and  below  the  upper
left corner of the array.
R2-3.2  The Row, Column (Matrix) Convention uses a
row,   column   address   and,   like   the   First-Quadrant
Convention, does not have a zero row or a zero column.
R2-3.3  The addresses of the corners of an array with m
columns  and  n rows in the Row, Column (Matrix)
Convention are as follows:
• upper left (Starting Element): (1,1)
• upper right: (1,m)
• lower left: (n,1)
• lower right: (n,m)
R2-3.4    The    general    formulas    for    obtaining    the
addresses  of  any  element  (i
m
,j
m
)  in  the  Row,  Column
(Matrix)  Convention  from  the  addresses  (i,j)  in  the
convention covered by this guide are as follows:</p><p>i
m
=integern / 2
(</p><p>)</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>1</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>j
j
m

( )</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>1</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>i</p><p>R2-3.5   These   equations   also   apply   to   arrays   with
column or row tiling if n
′ = n or m′ = m, respectively. If
this condition is not met, the displacement of the row or
column  which  defines  the  array  centerline  with  respect
to   the   boundary   of   the   array   must   be   known   to
transform the addresses.</p><p>SEMI M21-0304 © SEMI 1992, 2004 10</p><p>Figure R2-1

7  Test Methods and Measurements
7. 1    The  supplier  and  purchaser  shall  agree  in  advance
on the means for making all measurements (see Section
9).
7. 2  DI Wafer Characteristics
7. 2.1  Tub      Characteristics      ó      The      resistivity,
conductivity,  dopant  type,  and  crystal  growth  method
are  difficult  to  ascertain  in  the  finished  DI  wafers.
Verification  test  procedures  or  certification  of  these
characteristics   shall   be   agreed   upon   between   the
supplier and the purchaser (see Section 9).
7. 2.2  Tub  Diffused  Layers  ó  The  test  procedures  to
measure the sheet resistance, junction depth, and dopant
type   shall   be   agreed   upon   between   supplier   and
purchaser (see Section 9).
7. 2.3  Visual  Surface  Defects  and  Contamination  ó
Determine in accordance with ASTM Practice F 523.
7. 2.4  Microscopically    Observed    Die    Defects    ó
Examine  a  representative  sampling  of  die  (see  Section
8. 2)  with  an  optical  microscope  with  magnification
such  that  one  complete  electrical  die  fills  the  field  of
view.  If  necessary  for  verification  of  defects,  move  to
higher magnifications as required. Due to the extensive
microscopic    inspections    required,    verification    test
procedures or certification of these characteristics shall
be agreed upon between the supplier and the purchaser
(see Section 9).
8  Sampling
8. 1      Unless   otherwise   specified,   appropriate   sample
sizes  shall  be  selected  from  each  lot  according  to
ANSI/ASQC   Z1.4-1993.   Each   quality   characteristic
shall  be  an  assigned  an  acceptable  quality  level  (AQL)
in accordance with ANSI/ASQC Z1.4-1993. Inspection
levels   shall   be   agreed   upon   between   supplier   and
purchaser.
8. 2    The  sampling  plan  for  microscopic  inspection  of
die  on  the  wafer,  including  number  and  location  of
inspected  die,  shall  be  agreed  upon  between  supplier
and purchaser.
9  Certification
9. 1    Upon  request  of  the  purchaser  in  the  contract  or
order,  a  manufacturerís  or  supplierís  certification  that
the material was manufactured and tested in accordance
with  this  specification,  together  with  a  report  of  test
results, shall be furnished at the time of shipment.
9. 2    The  supplier  and  purchaser  may  agree  that  the
material  shall  be  certified  as  ìcapable  of  meetingî
certain   requirements.   In   this   context,   ìcapable   of
meetingî  shall  signify  that  the  supplier  is  not  required
to  perform  the  appropriate  tests  in  Section  7;  however,
if the purchaser performs the test and the material fails
to meet the requirement, the material may be subject to
rejection.
10  Packing and Marking
10. 1    Special  packing  requirements  shall  be  subject  to
agreement    between    the    supplier    and    purchaser.
Otherwise  all  wafers  shall  be  handled,  inspected,  and</p><p>SEMI M22-0303 © SEMI 1992, 2003 4
packed  in  such  a  manner  to  avoid  chipping,  scratches,
and  contamination,  and  in  accordance  with  the  best
industry practices to provide protection against damage
during shipment.
10. 2  The wafers supplied under this specification shall
be  identified  by  appropriately  labeling  the  outside  of
each  box  or  container  and  each  subdivision  thereof  in
which  it  may  reasonably  be  expected  that  the  wafers
will be stored prior to further processing. Identification
shall  include  supplierís  name  and  reference  no.,  date,
quantity,  DI  wafer  diameter,  DI  wafer  thickness,  and
customer  code  no.  The  reference  number  assigned  by
the  supplier  shall  provide  ready  access  to  information
concerning   the   fabrication   history   of   the   particular
wafers in that lot. Such information shall be retained on
file  at  the  manufacturerís  facility  for  at  least  one  year
after the particular lot has been shipped.</p><p>Figure 1

4. 1  Definitions
NOTE 1: The  selected  terminology  defined  here  has  been
adopted from ASTM Standard F1241.  Updates to this section
are  dependent  on  information  exchange  between  ASTM  and
SEMI.    Definitions  are  included  for  the  benefit  of  the  user,
however,  for  a  complete  list,  please  refer  to  ASTM  Standard
F1241.
4. 1.1  bow (of a semiconductor wafer)  —  the  deviation
of  the  center  point  of  the  median  surface  of  a  free,
unclamped   wafer   from   a   median-surface   reference
plane  established  by  three  points  equally  spaced  on  a
circle  with  diameter  a  specified  amount  less  than  the
nominal diameter of the wafer.  Contrast flatness.  Also
see warp.
4. 1.2  dopant  —  a  chemical  element,  usually  from  the
second, fourth, or sixth column of the periodic table for
the  case  of  III-V  compounds,  incorporated  in  trace</p><p>2  American Society for Quality Control, 611 East Wisconsin
Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53202

Burggrafenstrasse 6, D-10787 Berlin, Germany
amounts  in  a  semiconductor  crystal  to  establish  its
conductivity type and resistivity.
4. 1.3  edge profile — on wafers whose edges have been
rounded   by   mechanical   and/or   chemical   means,   a
description of the contour of the boundary of the wafer
that joins the front and back surfaces.
4. 1.4  lot — for the purpose of this document, (a) all of
the     wafers     of     nominally     identical     size     and
characteristics  contained  in  a  single  shipment,  or  (b)
subdivisions of large shipments consisting of wafers as
above  which  have  been  identified  by  the  supplier  as
constituting a lot.
4. 1.5  orthogonal misorientation — in {100} wafers cut
intentionally  “off-orientation,”  the  angle  between  the
projection  of  the  vector  normal  to  the  wafer  surface
onto the {100} plane and the projection on that plane of
the nearest direction (see Figure 5).
4. 1.6  TIR    —    on    a    wafer    surface,    the    smallest
perpendicular   distance   between   two   planes,   both
parallel  with  the  reference  plane,  which  enclose  all
points on the front surface of a wafer within the flatness
quality   area   or   the   site,   depending   on   which   is
specified.
4. 1.7  TTV,    total    thickness    variation    —    of    a
semiconductor   wafer,   the   difference   between   the
maximum  and  minimum  values  of  the  thickness  of  the
wafer.
4. 1.8  warp — of a semiconductor wafer, the difference
between  the  maximum  and  minimum  distances  of  the
median  surface  of  a  free,  unclamped  wafer  from  a
reference plane, encountered during a scan pattern.

APPENDIX 1
NOTE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  M23.3  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot  procedures  on
April 21, 2000 by the Japanese Regional Standards Committee.
A1-1  InP is a promising material for photonic devices
such   as   LDs,   LEDs,   and   photodetectors   for   fiber
communications.  The  consumption  of  InP  wafers  is
increasing year by year due to the fiber communication
systems such as LAN, ISDN, and others.
A1-2      In   order   to   fabricate   these   devices,   many
rectangular wafers with more than 30 different sizes are
industrially   used   but   most   of   the   sizes   are   not
reasonably determined. From the viewpoint of material
yield   as   explained   below,   the   standardization   of
rectangular InP wafers is useful not only for InP wafer
manufacturers, but also for device manufacturers.
A1-3    Figure  A1-1  shows  the  effective  area  (A)  as  a
function of ratio of longitudinal length (a) and of lateral
length  (b).  It  is  a  fact  that  the  largest  area  can  be
obtained  when  the  shape  is  square.  However,  it  is
difficult to distinguish V-Groove and Dove-Tail Groove
orientations  when  the  shape  is  square.  It  is,  therefore,
necessary  to  make  the  shape  rectangular  in  a  way  that
one  can  distinguish  the  orientations.  It  is  however,
noted  that  if  the  length  ratio  becomes  too  large,  the
effective  area  is  dramatically  decreased  as  seen  in
Figure  A1-1.  For  instance,  rectangular  wafers  at  the
point  P  have  very  little  area,  and  most  of  wafer  is  cut
off in vain. It is, therefore, very reasonable to select the
length  ratio  at  which  the  effective  area  is  not  largely
decreased.  When  the  length  ratio  (a/b  ratio)  is  √2,  the
area  decrease  is  only  5.7%  as  seen  in  Table  A1-1  and
Figure  A1-1.  It  is  also  interesting  to  note  that  if  the
length  ratio  is  determined  as  √2,  each  half  of  the
rectangular  wafer  again  gives  a  similar  shape  with  the
same  ratio.  In  fact,  this  length  ratio  is  used  for  paper
standardization as A3/A4 or B3/B4. Rectangular wafers
are therefore determined SEMI M23.3.
A1-4    Since  there  are  already  standardized  50  mm  and
75  mm  round  wafers,  the  standardization  is  made  in  a
way that large rectangular wafers can be obtained from
these  standardized  wafers  by  removing  5  mm  from  the
periphery as seen in Figure A1-2. Removing of 5 mm is
due to EPD measurement specifications in which 5 mm
periphery is excluded from the measurement.
A1-5  As explained above, it is highly recommended to
use  the  standardized  rectangular  wafers  because  this
standardization    is    very    important    in    preventing
proliferation  of  various  sizes  of  rectangular  wafers  in
the future.
