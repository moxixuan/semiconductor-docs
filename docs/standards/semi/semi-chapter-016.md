SEMI E101-1104 © SEMI 2000, 20041 SEMI E101-1104GUIDE FOR EFEM FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE MODEL This guide was technically approved by the Global Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee and is thedirect responsibility of the North American Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee. Current editionapproved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004. Initially available atwww.semi.org September 2004, to be published November. Originally published February 2000; previouslypublished October 2000. 1 Purpose1.1 Productivity improvement is the task with thehighest priority in semiconductor factories of the 300mm generation, and computer-integrated manufact-uring or factory automation (CIM/FA) technologiesbecome more and more important to accomplish it. Thestandardization of these technologies is also necessaryto provide the CIM/FA infrastructure in a short periodof time at a low cost. Since the standards will have tocover a wide range of production equipment, communi-cation hardware, and software tools, it is very importantthat the standards have a high degree of compatibility.In order to improve the compatibility, this guideprovides a functional structure model of an EquipmentFront End Module (EFEM) that handles carriers andsubstrates at the interface between the factory materialhandling system and the process equipment.1.2 The major purposes of this guide are as follows:1) provide a common understanding of functions ofEFEM (Equipment Front End Module) and associatedinterfaces between functional elements (componentswith particular function roles),2) provide a common understanding of the hierarchicalstructure of functions and their interfaces in an EFEM,3) provide a common understanding of possible unitsused for maintenance, adjustment, and control, and4) provide a map between EFEM functional elementsand existing standards. 2 Scope2.1 Model Structure and Functions2.1.1 This document recognizes EFEM as a componentof semiconductor manufacturing equipment. It createsan EFEM functional structure model to clearly describeEFEM, its functional elements, and the functions ofeach functional element. The functional structure modelincludes the following:1) definition of functional elements that constituteEFEM,2) definition of functions of functional elements, and3) hierarchical description of functional elements. 2.1.2 For clarity, Fixed Buffer Type EFEM andInternal Buffer Type EFEM (see Terminology) arerepresented as independent functional structure modelsin this document.2.2 Preconditions for Modeling2.2.1 The models are created under the followingconditions:1) Modeling should be restricted to SEMI E15.1,Option 1, Options 2 and 3, and Option 3 types. (SeeSEMI E15.1, Figure 2 (Load Port Options)).2) The model supports handling of open cassette (OC),and Front Opening Unified Pod (FOUP) (seeTerminology).3) The model is created for the maximum structureincluding options.4) Functional elements that have interfaces with EFEMare also included in the model.NOTE 1: Functional elements that dont belong to EFEM, butare important in defining interfaces among the functionalelements, are represented in this model to clarify theirfunctional positions and attributes in the entire equipment.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E1.9  Mechanical Specification for CassettesUsed to Transport and Store 300 mm WafersSEMI E15  Specification for Tool Load PortSEMI E15.1  Specification for 300 mm Tool LoadPortSEMI E19  Standard Mechanical Interface (SMIF)SEMI E23  Specification for Cassette TransferParallel I/O Interface

SEMI E103-0704 © SEMI 2000, 20041 SEMI E103-0704MECHANICAL SPECIFICATION FOR A 300 mm SINGLE-WAFER BOXSYSTEM THAT EMULATES A FOUP This specification was technically approved by the Global Physical Interfaces & Carriers Committee and isthe direct responsibility of the European Equipment Automation Committee. Current edition approved by theEuropean Regional Standards Committee on May 14, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org June 2004;to be published July 2004. Originally published June 2000; last published November 2003. 1 Purpose1.1 This standard specifies the carrier side of themechanical interface between load ports (or buffers)with FIMS interfaces on process or metrologyequipment and a system that includes a box that holdsonly one wafer (such as a test wafer) and that fits ontoan adapter mechanism called a single-wafer interface(SWIF). This system appears to the equipment to be a300 mm FOUP (except that only the volume around themiddle wafer may be accessible). 2 Scope2.1 This standard is intended to set an appropriate levelof specification that places minimal limits oninnovation while ensuring modularity and inter-changeability at relevant mechanical interfaces. Onlythe mechanical interface between a load port with aFIMS interface and this system (of a single-wafer boxand a SWIF) is specified here; the mechanical interfacebetween the single-wafer box and the SWIF is notspecified. Also not specified is the method by whichthe SWIF raises the carrier sensing pads when thesingle-wafer box is removed (see Section 6.3). Thisstandard does not forbid the SWIF from holding morethan just the single-wafer box mentioned in thisstandard.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E1.9  Mechanical Specification for CassettesUsed to Transport and Store 300 mm WafersSEMI E15  Specification for Tool Load PortSEMI E19  Standard Mechanical Interface (SMIF)SEMI E47.1  Provisional Mechanical Specificationfor Boxes and Pods Used to Transport and Store 300mm Wafers SEMI E62  Provisional Specification for 300 mmFront-Opening Interface Mechanical Standard (FIMS)NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 4 Ordering Information4.1 Info Pad Configuration  The purchaser of asingle wafer interface system needs to specify thedesired info pad configuration (up or down). 5 Terminology5.1 Abbreviations & Acronyms5.1.1 FOUP  front-opening unified pod5.1.2 PGV  person guided vehicle (cart)5.1.3 SWIF  single-wafer interface5.2 Definitions5.2.1 box  a protective portable container for acassette and/or substrate(s).5.2.2 carrier capacity  the number of substrates thata carrier holds (as defined in SEMI E1.9).5.2.3 cassette  an open structure that holds one ormore substrates.5.2.4 front-opening unified pod  a box (that complieswith SEMI E47.1) with a non-removable cassette (sothat its interior complies with SEMI E1.9) and with afront-opening interface (that mates with a FIMS portthat complies with SEMI E62) (as defined in SEMIE47.1).5.2.5 pod  a box having a Standard MechanicalInterface (SMIF) per SEMI E19.5.2.6 single-wafer interface  an adapter mechanismthat holds a single-wafer box and that appears to theequipment to be a 300 mm FOUP (except that only thevolume around the middle wafer may be accessible).5.2.7 wafer carrier  any cassette, box, pod, or boatthat contains wafers (as defined in SEMI E15).

SEMI E103-0704 © SEMI 2000, 2004 2 6 Requirements6.1 System Components  A system that conforms tothis standard must include a box that holds one waferand that fits onto a SWIF.6.2 Relevant FOUP Dimensions  The SWIF musthave all of the required bottom and front features andbe no larger than the maximum dimensions of a 13- or25-wafer FOUP. However, this system (of single-waferbox and SWIF) must have box placement sensing padsas specified in SEMI E47.1 FOUP standardsRequirements Section 6.12. For example, the SWIFmust comply with dimensions r67, x53, y50, y51, y52,y53, z41, z47  z48, z47 + z49, and the upper limits onx50 and y40 (as specified in SEMI E47.1) and withdimension y33 (as specified in SEMI E62).6.3 Optional Automation Features  Since the single-wafer box and/or SWIF will usually be deliveredmanually (possibly with a PGV), the SWIF is notrequired to have the other automation features of theFOUP such as the robotic handling flange on top or thefork-lift flanges on the side (although this standard doesnot forbid the SWIF from having such features).6.4 SWIF Door  The SWIF must have a full FOUP-size door (which surrounds the door of the single-wafer box) that mates with a FIMS-compatible interface (asspecified in SEMI E62) to avoid contaminating theenvironment on the equipment side of the FIMSinterface.6.5 Wafer Position  When the FIMS door is openedby the equipment, the end effector may only be able toaccess the middle wafer slot (wafer 7 for a SWIF thatemulates a 13-wafer carrier, and wafer 13 for a SWIFthat emulates a 25-wafer carrier), because a surfaceimmediately behind the door may block access to theother wafer slots. Thus, batch wafer handlers willprobably not work with this system.6.6 Wafer Clearances  The clearance below themiddle wafer must be the same as the clearance belowthe bottom wafer in an ordinary FOUP (z8 minus z6,both from SEMI E1.9), and the clearance above themiddle wafer must be the same as the clearance abovethe top wafer in an ordinary FOUP (z15 from SEMIE1.9). These vertical clearances are defined in SEMIE1.9 and SEMI E47.1 and apply throughout the waferset-down and extraction volumes for the middle wafer.The horizontal clearances shown in Figure 10 of SEMIE47.1 are also required. One possible example of sucha system (of single-wafer box and SWIF) is shown inFigures 1 and 2 (with vertical clearances indicated). wafer 33 mm \[z8 from SEMI E1.9\] 21 mm \[z6 from SEMI E1.9\]= 12.0 mm minimum 11 mm \[z44 from SEMI E47.1\]+ 33 mm \[z8 from SEMI E1.9\]+ 10 mm \[z12 from SEMI E1.9\]  (6 or 12 wafers)± 0.5 mm \[z10 from SEMI E1.9\]= 164.0±0.5 mm (for wafer #13 in a 25-wafer FOUP)or 104.0±0.5 mm (for wafer #7 in a 13-wafer FOUP) 13.0 mm minimum\[z15 from SEMI E1.9\] single-wafer box single wafer interface (SWIF) equipment load port FIMS port 11 mm \[z44 from SEMI E47.1\]+ 33 mm \[z8 from SEMI E1.9\]+ 10 mm \[z12 from SEMI E1.9\]  (6 or 12 wafers)± 0.5 mm \[z10 from SEMI E1.9\]= 164.0 ± 0.5 mm (for wafer #13 in a 25-wafer FOUP)or 104.0 ± 0.5 mm (for wafer #7 in a 13-wafer FOUP) Figure 1Side View of Example Single-Wafer Box and SWIF on a Load Port with a FIMS Interface

However,when the single-wafer box is removed from the SWIF,all of the carrier sensing pads (defined in Section 6.6 ofSEMI E1.9) on the bottom of the SWIF must be raised(so that the load port can sense a change of carriers byits carrier placement sensor, if any). However, in orderto ensure that the SWIF triggers most optical carrierpresence detectors on the load port, the SWIF (withouta single-wafer box) must block any line of sightthrough a volume consisting of the smallest cylindricalsection that contains all of the wafer pick-up volumes(defined in SEMI E1.9) of the corresponding FOUP(defined in SEMI E47.1). Note that this standard doesnot prevent the use of other kinds of carrier presencedetectors (such as sensors that detect weight on the loadport). 7 Related Documents7.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E15.1  Specification for 300 mm Tool LoadPortSEMI E57  Mechanical Specification for KinematicCouplings Used to Align and Support 300 mm WaferCarriersSEMI E63  Mechanical Specification for 300 mmBox Opener/Loader to Tool Standard (BOLTS-M)InterfaceSEMI E72  Specification and Guide for 300 mmEquipment Footprint, Height, and Weight SEMI E92  Specification for 300 mm Light Weightand Compact Box Opener/Loader and Tool-InterfaceStandard (BOLTS-Light)SEMI M31  Provisional Mechanical Specification forFront-Opening Shipping Box Used to Transport andShip 300 mm WafersSEMI S8  Safety Guidelines for Ergonomics/ HumanFactors Engineering of Semiconductor ManufacturingEquipmentNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions.

R1-1R1-1.1 In fabs in which this system (of single-wafer box and SWIF) is used, equipment should have controlsoftware algorithms that prevent end effectors and wafer slot mappers from entering the carrier except in theclearances around the middle wafer (defined in Section 6.2) when the presence of this system is detected. A varietyof methods for differentiating the system from ordinary FOUPs are possible.R1-1.2 Using sensors, equipment can differentiate the system (of single-wafer box and SWIF) from ordinaryFOUPs. For example, sensors below the info pad B location on the load port and on the FIMS door (opposite theseal zones or the reserved spaces for vacuum application on the box door) could indicate that the carrier type is anopen cassette but with a FOUP door, together implying the presence of this system (of a single-wafer box andSWIF). Note that such sensors on the load port are not currently specified in any SEMI standard.R1-1.3 Carrier ID tags can inform the equipment that the load port holds this system (of single-wafer box andSWIF) instead of an ordinary FOUP.R1-1.4 Messages from the host computer system can inform the equipment that the load port holds this system (ofsingle-wafer box and SWIF) instead of an ordinary FOUP.

SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 20031 SEMI E104-0303SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FORCALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR This specification was technically approved by the Global Metrics Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the European Equipment Automation Committee. Current edition approved by the European RegionalStandards Committee on January 8, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org January 2003; to be publishedMarch 2003. Originally published October 2000; previously published March 2002. 1 Purpose1.1 The use of in situ particle monitoring (ISPM;particle measurements performed while the waferresides inside the processing chamber) in low-pressureand vacuum applications provides a number ofadvantages for defect, process, and equipmentmanagement such as: Reduction of particle test wafers used for off-linetests and saving operator time, Optimization and real-time characterization of theprocess, Advanced process control, Advanced equipment control, Monitoring process chamber conditions, and Optimization of cleaning procedures andmaintenance.1.1.1 Therefore, ISPM achieves more equipmentavailability and faster ramp-up of the production,reduces cost of ownership, improves quality and yield.To reach these goals, ISPM needs to be easilyintegrated into new or existing process equipment andthe acquisition as well as the analysis of the particledata needs to be automated. The ISPM sensor shouldnot have any negative influence on the process and themeasurement has to represent the main particle flow.The sensor should be designed to have a minimumnegative impact on the parameters defined in SEMI E10for the whole semiconductor process equipment, toachieve an advantage in capacity.1.2 This standard is intended to stipulate operatingconditions, mechanical, electrical, and communicationinterfaces for the use of Low-pressure ParticleDetectors integrated in semiconductor processequipment. A guideline for a reference calibration ofthose sensors is intended to support correlation betweenmeasurements with different sensors. 2 Scope2.1 This standard applies to particle measurementunder low-pressure and vacuum conditions insemiconductor manufacturing equipment.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior touse. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI C6.5  Particle Specification for Grade 10/0.2Nitrogen (N 2) and Argon (Ar) Delivered as PipelineGasSEMI C6.6  Particle Specification for Grade 10/0.1Nitrogen (N 2) and Argon (Ar) Delivered as PipelineGasSEMI E4  SEMI Equipment CommunicationsStandard 1 Message Transfer (SECS-I)SEMI E5  SEMI Equipment CommunicationsStandard 2 Message Content (SECS-II)SEMI E10  Specification for Definition andMeasurement of Equipment Reliability, Availability,and Maintainability (RAM)SEMI E33  Specification for SemiconductorManufacturing Facility Electromagnetic CompatibilitySEMI E37  High-Speed SECS Message Services(HSMS) Generic ServicesSEMI E54  Sensor/Actuator Network StandardSEMI E54.10  Specification for Sensor/ActuatorNetwork Specific Device Model for an In-Situ ParticleMonitor DeviceSEMI F6  Guide for Secondary Containment ofHazardous Gas Piping Systems

SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 20035 5.2 Space, Distances, and Installation5.2.1 The use of an LPPD should not have a negativeimpact on the process performance. The sensor locationin the equipment shall ensure an optimum use of thesensor sensitivity in order to allow a measurementwhich is representative of the main particle flow. Theinfluence of the process and the process equipment onthe LPPD shall be minimized (thermal backgroundradiation, vibrations etc.)5.2.2 The standard does not specify where an LPPDshould be located in original equipment, or where spaceshould be allowed for retro-fitting. It is recognized thatthe location is dependent on factors including transportbehavior of particles, thermal background radiation etc.The designers of semiconductor process equipmentshould resort to the experience of application engineersof the LPPD suppliers and the end users. However, ineither case designers shall take into account accessrequirements for maintenance and re-calibration. In thecase of retro-fitting, the design should facilitate sensorinstallation rather than hinder it. 6 Electrical Interfaces6.1 Sensor/Controller Communication6.1.1 Depending on the choice of the LPPD supplierand the semiconductor equipment manufacturer, one ofthe following interfaces for data exchange between theLPPD and process equipment controller should be used.6.1.2 Sensor/Actuator Network (SAN)6.1.2.1 The electrical interfaces of the Sensor/ ActuatorNetwork are described in the suite of SEMI E54standards.6.1.3 Serial Communication6.1.3.1 RS 232 C (V.24/V.28)6.1.3.2 RS 4856.1.4 Others6.1.4.1 IEEE 488 or IEC 606256.2 Others6.2.1 Sensor calibration output (direct analog output)6.2.1.1 The analog output for access to the sensorsignal used for calibration purpose should be supported. 7 Communication Interfaces7.1 Sensor Bus Communication7.1.1 It is recommended to use a Sensor/ActuatorNetwork (SAN) for the intra-tool communicationbetween the LPPD controller and the controller of theprocess equipment. This communication is based on a suite of SEMI standards including a networkcommunication standard, several common devicemodels (DeviceNet, SDS, Lonworks, ProfiBus etc.),and the specific device model for the sensor. TheNetwork is described by the following suite of SEMIstandards: SEMI E54. The specific device model forISPM is described by SEMI E54.10.7.2 SEMI Equipment Communication (SECS)7.2.1 If LPPD controllers provide the collected particledata to the process equipment controller, factoryautomation system, or SPC system, the SECS tool-to-host communication could be used.

Ifthe use of an LPPD at an extended ambient temperaturerange is required, the specific LPPD should complywith these conditions.8.2.2 The temperature TG inside the pump line orinside the process equipment depends on the actualapplication. The application engineers shall check theuse of LPPDs under these specific conditions. Thetemperature TG is measured at the flange which theLPPD is mounted on.

SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 2003 6 8.3 Humidity8.3.1 The LPPD should work correctly at an ambienthumidity range RH as specified in ISO 14644-5. If theuse of an LPPD at an extended ambient humidity rangeis required, the specific LPPD should comply withthese conditions.8.4 Electromagnetic Compatibility8.4.1 The equipment should comply with SEMI E33.8.4.2 Sensors will be incorporated into equipmenteither as original equipment or retro-fitted. In eithercase, the sensors or the equipment of which they are apart should comply with the current regulationscovering EMC in the country or region where theequipment or sensor is used.8.5 Vibrations8.5.1 Process equipment designers are advised toconsider the impact of vibration on the performance ofthe sensor while it is collecting data. Therefore, theyshould minimize vibrations. The designers of the LPPDsensors are also advised to consider the impact ofvibrations on the equipment at a time the sensor is notcollecting any data. It might be possible that thesevibrations are stronger than those occurring while thesensor is collecting data. 9 Reference Calibration Procedure9.1 The response of real contamination particles,typically with refractive indices and shapes differentfrom calibration particles, will differ slightly from theresults obtained by the procedures in this document. Itis known that LPPDs with different optical design maynot produce the same data from identical aerosolsamples. This may happen even with similar LPPDs ifcalibration differences have occurred. Therefore, beforethe first use the sensor should be calibrated by themanufacturer. This calibration should be compliantwith or should be reviewed with the following referencecalibration equipment and procedure. This referencecalibration allows the characterization of theperformance of the LPPD under test. The LPPD shouldbe recalibrated at regular intervals and also in case ofunusual measurement readings to ensure correct results.9.1.1 The parameters calibrated for LPPDs with sizingcapability are: Sizing calibration, Resolution, Zero counting, Counting efficiency, and Sensitivity. 9.1.2 The parameters calibrated for LPPDs with non-sizing capability are: Zero counting, and Counting efficiency.9.1.3 Field calibration may not necessarily require thecalibration of all parameters performed by calibration atthe sensor manufacturers site.9.1.4 Due to the fact that different LPPDs might beworking with different detection areas AL , the numberof counts should be printed out in counts per mm2detection area. Therefore, a comparison of themeasurement results of different LPPDs is possible.The size of the detection area A L shall be reported inthe calibration report form. Any changes of calibrationparameters or of the calibration setup shall be reportedin the calibration report form. A copy of the calibrationreport form shall be delivered with the sensor.9.2 Apparatus9.2.1 Materials9.2.1.1 Particles9.2.1.1.1 Calibration particles are polymer spherescomposed of polystyrene or a similar polymer, having arefractive index of 1.58-1.61+0i (absorption coefficient = 0), a sizing accuracy of at least 95%, and a sizedistribution in which the coefficient of variation is 5%or less. They should be traceable to a nationally orinternationally recognized standard (e.g. NIST9).9.2.1.1.2 The calibration particles are normallysupplied in concentrations too high to be used directlyin aerosol generators. The particles should be dispersedand diluted in either deionized, distilled water inaccordance with ASTM D1193, Type 1, or Isopropanol.The diluent should be cleaned using a filter with a poresize no more than 10% of the size of the particles beingused. The solution should be stored in a clean container.For generation and dilution of the suspension seeAppendix 3. After generation the particles should beneutralized to avoid surface charge. For all testsdescribed in this document, the concentration should beno more than 25% of the maximum recommendedconcentration limit specified by the manufacturer. Forcalibration a suitable set of particle sizes shall be used.This set should contain at least 5 sizes that cover theLDL size to at least 80% of the specified maximum sizemeasurement capability of the LPPD.NOTE 4: Most of the ISPM sensors are based on lightscattering.

In the particle size range near the wavelength (0.1&lt; dP &lt; 10), large oscillations can be seen in the intensitycurve of the light scattered by spherical particles as a functionof all these parameters. This phenomenon should be takeninto account when selecting a suitable set of particle sizes forcalibration. The used calibration particles should be within amonotonic response range of the LPPD response curve.9.2.1.2 Zero Gas9.2.1.2.1 Clean air or nitrogen filtered with a ULPAfilter.NOTE 5: The calibration will be executed under atmosphericpressure and zero gas. In semiconductor manufacturing,pressure and process gases will differ from the calibrationconditions. This will affect the refractive index ratio of theparticles and the process gas and consequently the scatteringfrom the particles.9.2.1.3 Surfaces9.2.1.3.1 The materials of pump lines and othercomponents should be conductive to minimizeelectrostatic interaction with the particles.9.2.2 Instrumentation (see Figure 1)  Some LPPDsmay require specialized equipment not generallyavailable. Please contact the LPPD manufacturer.9.2.2.1 Fan System9.2.2.1.1 The fan or pump system should be adjustableto transport the aerosol and the zero gas within thestipulated velocity range v L, min ... v L,max , specified bythe manufacturer of the LPPD.9.2.2.2 Filter System9.2.2.2.1 The ULPA filter system is used for gener-ation of zero gas. The filter system should be capable ofremoving particles at the minimum size detectable bythe LPPD or the reference particle counter.9.2.2.3 Aerosol Generator9.2.2.3.1 An atomizer converts the monodisperseparticle suspension to an aerosol by using compressedzero gas for generation and transportation of theparticles.

Thevariation in particle concentration shall be no more than10% as measured by the reference particle counter overa time period of 10 times or more of the samplemeasurement time. The generation should comply withthe German VDI-Richtlinie 3491, or an equivalentstandard in other countries.9.2.2.4 Aerosol dryer 9.2.2.4.1 The monodisperse polymer spheres in the testaerosol shall be thoroughly dry to avoid that theparticles have a water layer which would increase theirsize. A diffusion dryer, another appropriate instrument,or adequately dry dilution air should be used to dry theparticles. The diffusion dryer uses silica gel desiccant toremove the moisture. The desiccant shall either be newor freshly regenerated. The design flow rate of theaerosol dryer shall at least match the output flow rate ofthe aerosol generator.NOTE 6: Some diffusion dryers may precipitate polymerspheres and add other particles when the aerosol gets in directcontact with the silica gel.9.2.2.5 Neutralizer9.2.2.5.1 An aerosol neutralizer should be connected inline with the dryer to reduce electrostatic charges on thedry polymer spheres and to avoid electrostaticinteraction with each other or the line wall. The designflow rate of the aerosol neutralizer shall at least matchthe output flow rate of the aerosol generator.NOTE 7: Some electrostatic neutralizers may produce a largenumber of ultra-fine particles which will combine with thecalibration aerosol.9.2.2.6 Aerosol Size Separator9.2.2.6.1 In the case of calibration with ultra-fineparticles, a system should be used to separate singlepolymer spheres from the residual particles resultingfrom vaporization of solutions and aggregate particlesconsisting of several spheres. The size separation couldbe achieved with an electrostatic classifier or adiffusion battery.9.2.2.7 Aerosol Dilution9.2.2.7.1 If the particle concentration behind theaerosol generator is too high, the particle flow shall bediluted to achieve the required concentration and toavoid coincidence errors.

The line should be as short and straightas possible with no bends with a radius of curvature lessthan 100 mm. Leak-free connections of the line and alldevices should be ensured using appropriate fittings.9.2.2.8.3 Figure 1 illustrates a recommendedcalibration aerosol generation system.9.2.2.9 Flow Control9.2.2.9.1 The velocity of aerosol and the zero gasshould be within the stipulated range vL, min ... v L,max ,specified by the manufacturer of the LPPD. Dependenton the line diameter DL , a stipulated aerosol flow isnecessary. The velocity meter (e.g. thermoanemometer)or flow meter should be mounted in a line with knowndiameter D VM .NOTE 8: The aerosol drawn by the reference particle counterinfluences the velocity or flow measured by the velocitymeter or flow meter if it is mounted behind the probe inlet.This is taken into account when calculating and adjusting theflow and velocity v L at the LPPD. If the velocity meter orflow meter is mounted in front of the probe inlet of thereference particle counter, the device should have noinfluence on the particle size distribution measured by thereference particle counter.9.2.2.10 Calibration Line System9.2.2.10.1 The system consisting of a device to inject the particles into the zero gas, a device to mix the aerosol sample with the zerogas to obtain uniform particle concentration, a device to adapt the LPPD into the line (diameterD L ), a device to adapt the velocity meter or the flowmeter, a device (diameter DRC = D L , same particleconcentration as at the LPPD) to draw a defined,isokinetic sample from the line for the referenceparticle counter (the opening area of the probe inletshould be reported in the calibration report form),and tubing connecting the devices with each other andwith the fan and filter system.9.2.2.10.2 The line system should be smooth, conduc-tive, and electrically grounded to minimize electrostaticinteraction of the particles with line walls and the parti-cles themselves. The line should be as short and straightas possible with no bends with a radius of curvature less than 100 mm. Leak-free connections of the line and alldevices should be ensured using appropriate fittings.9.2.2.10.3 Figure 1 illustrates a recommended LPPDcalibration system.NOTE 9: The distance between the device to adapt the LPPDunder test and the device for sample acquisition for thereference particle counter should be as short as possible tominimize particle loss and to ensure comparable particleconcentrations.9.2.2.11 Reference Particle Counter (RPC)9.2.2.11.1 The reference particle counter is required tomeasure the actual concentration of the monodisperseaerosol and the quality of the zero gas inside the line.Therefore, the counting efficiency of the referenceparticle counter is defined as 100% over the range ofparticle sizes used in the test. The resolution should bebetter than 10% at the lower detection limit of theLPPD under test. The values of the measurementshould be printed out in counts per mm2 opening areaA RC of the probe inlet. The sample transit line from theprobe inlet and the reference particle counter should beas short and as straight as possible. Smooth, conductive,and electrically grounded materials should be used.9.2.2.12 Sensor Window Temperature9.2.2.12.1 Some LPPDs have the capability to heattheir sensor windows to avoid coating of the window. Adevice to measure and to adjust the sensor windowtemperature within the operating range (measurable to5%) should be installed in the calibration setup. Thethermometer should be calibrated with an accuracy of0.2°C.9.2.2.13 Pulse Height Analyzer (PHA)9.2.2.13.1 The external analyzer is connected with theanalog sensor calibration output. The PHA should haveat least 64 channels and a resolution of at least 1% ofthe average voltage that will be measured. The use of aPHA, which is built into the sensor electronics, isallowed if this PHA meets the criteria mentioned above.The required range and speed will depend on theperformance of the LPPD under test. These parametersshould be obtained by the LPPD manufacturer.9.2.2.14 Environmental Monitoring9.2.2.14.1 The environmental temperature TA ismeasured by a thermometer calibrated with an accuracyof 0.2°C.9.2.2.14.2 The environmental relative humidity RH ismeasured by a hygrometer.9.2.2.14.3 The atmospheric pressure p is measured by abarometer calibrated with an accuracy of 133 Pa.

For this reason, thisdocument cannot provide detailed procedures for calibratingevery LPPD. For detailed procedures for calibrating a specificLPPD, contact the manufacturer. The calibration should beperformed by a skilled technician.9.3.1 If the aerosol flow rate is varied, then particleresidence time in the detection area AL will also vary.This results in pulses of varying duration. Therefore,the particle velocity vL at the LPPD should be constantand independent of the line diameter D L . The fan has tobe regulated so that the aerosol velocity at the velocitymeter is vVM = v L D 2L / D 2VM . At a constant volumeflow rate VG (depending on the pressure of thecompressed air) and constant number concentration CGthe level of number concentration CL reaches a valuedependent on line diameter D L at constant velocity v L .With the known detection area A L of the LPPD, thenumber of particles per time (counts per mm2 detectionarea per time) is defined. The RPC monitors the number of particles CL of the aerosol generator and the zero airinside the line.9.3.2 If the response signal for the used particle sizedoes not meet the expectations, the operator might useanother particle size within the required size range.9.3.3 Calibration Parameters9.3.3.1 The sample measurement time for thecalibration with each particle size should be at least 30seconds to avoid statistical errors.9.3.3.2 The calibration is to be performed at ambientatmospheric pressure in a controlled environment(temperature, humidity, vibrations).9.3.3.3 The calibration of the LPPD is to be executedin a line diameter DL in which the LPPD should beinstalled by the user.9.3.3.4 Fixed particle concentration at the LPPD CP toensure that the coincidence error is always less than10%.

In such cases theused aerosol velocity at the location of the LPPD shallbe reported in the calibration report form.9.3.4 Initial Setup9.3.4.1 Connect the aerosol generator to a supply offiltered, dried, and compressed zero gas (see Figure 1).Connect a dryer, neutralizer, and size separator (ifnecessary) to the aerosol outlet of the particle generator.If a dilution of the aerosol before the injection in thecalibration line is necessary, install a dilution stagebehind the size separator.9.3.4.2 Connect the aerosol line to the calibration line.Mount the LPPD under test behind the injection andmixing device. Install the sample acquisition device andthe velocity or flow meter into the calibration line.9.3.4.3 Connect a PHA to the sensor calibration outputif an appropriate built-in PHA is not available.9.3.4.4 Before starting the following procedures, makesure all instruments are turned on and allow a certaintime for warm-up and temperature stabilization.9.3.4.5 Purge the aerosol line and the calibration linewith filtered and dried air for a minimum of 30 minutes.9.3.4.6 Check the quality of the zero gas and thecondition of the calibration line using the RPC. Collectcounts for three one-minute periods and determine theaverage number of particles reported in counts perminute. The volume flow of the zero gas shall beenough for correct operation of the RPC. Record thecumulative particle count reported for the zero gas forparticles equal to and larger than the LDL of the LPPDunder test.9.3.4.7 Clean the aerosol generator liquid reservoir andfill it with clean diluent (particle-free deionized ordestilled water or Isopropanol). Run the aerosolgenerator and adjust the pressure and flow rates asrecommended by the aerosol generator manufacturer.Check the condition of the aerosol line using the RPC.Collect counts for three one-minute periods anddetermine the average number of particles reported perliter of air. If the number exceeds 1 particle per liter air,the diluent shall be refiltered before further use. Theaverage number of particles (counts per minute) shouldbe reported in the calibration report form.9.3.4.8 Adjust the volume flow through the calibrationline for the stipulated aerosol velocity at the LPPDunder test. 9.3.4.9 Allow a certain time for stabilization of theadjusted calibration parameters before any test isperformed.9.3.5 Sizing LPPDNOTE 11: For more information and background seeAppendix 2.9.3.5.1 Size CalibrationNOTE 12: To define the calibration settings either the modeor median of the voltage pulse distribution could be used. Theuse of the modal procedure is common. The calibration reportform should identify the used method.9.3.5.1.1 By running different monodisperse aerosols(with v L and VL = V0 + VG ), size calibration isperformed. Begin with the largest particles for which acalibration value is required. Select the particle sizerange for which calibration is required. Be sure that theparticle concentration is low enough that predominantlyindividual pulses are generated by the LPPD.Accumulate enough data to avoid statistical errors. Theprocedure is repeated for each particle size of interest.Determine the average LPPD pulse voltage amplitudewith the PHA.9.3.5.1.2 The mode of the voltage pulse distribution isdetermined by the highest point in the distribution. Ifthe distribution is interfered with noise near the peakand the peak is not well defined, the data should beaveraged and the peak of the averaged distributionshould be used defining the mode.9.3.5.1.3 The median voltage is determined by defininga Region of Interest (ROI) which includes the peakrepresenting the voltage pulses from single polymerspheres. The PHA determines the total number ofpulses under this peak. The median voltage is thatvoltage which devises the number of pulses in theregion such that half are greater and half are less thanthe median.NOTE 13: If the procedure is carried out for the smallest sizeof which the LPPD is specified, record the noise level of theLPPD. The average voltage for this size should be at least10% higher than stated noise level voltage at which one noisepulse occurs in one minute.9.3.5.1.4 The particle size and the average voltageshould be reported in the calibration report form.9.3.5.1.5 For calibration checks, a reference particlecounter (RPC) with a good sizing capability could beused. The counting efficiency of the RPC is defined as100% for the particle sizes used in test. The counts ofthe RPC and the LPPD under test in the correspondingchannel should be normalized to a standard detectionarea (mm2). The ratio of these counts (in %), theemployed particle size and the threshold settings shouldbe recorded in the calibration report form.

SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 200311 9.3.5.2 Zero CountingNOTE 14: The intent of this procedure is not to adjust thethresholds for the zero count rate but to verify whether theLPPD is within its specification.9.3.5.2.1 By running zero gas (with vL and VL = V0)through the system the zero count rate, specified by thesensor manufacturer, is checked. The reference particlecounter is used to check the quality of the zero gas. Theminimum acceptable sample time is 10 minutes. Thesampling time shall be long enough to provide adequatesampling statistics. The zero count rate (average countsper minute) should be recorded in the calibration reportform.9.3.5.3 Counting EfficiencyNOTE 15: The actual particle concentration is determinedwith a reference particle counter with a 100% countingefficiency for the employed particle size. It is important thatthere are no differences between the concentration within thedetection area of the LPPD and the concentration monitoredby the RPC.9.3.5.3.1 By running a monodisperse aerosol (with v Land VL = V0 + VG ), the maximum of detectedparticles is counted. The ratio of the counts of theLPPD standardized per mm 2 to the counts of thereference particle counter per mm2 detection area (in %)for each particle size should be recorded in thecalibration report form.9.3.5.4 Sensitivity9.3.5.4.1 By running different monodisperse aerosols(with v L and VL = V0 + VG ) with particle sizes at theexpected sensitivity where the counting efficiency isbetween 40% and 60%, the sensitivity is verified. Thecounts of the LPPD per mm2 detection area comparedto the counts of the reference particle counter per mm2detection area (in %) should be determined. Thedetermined particle size shall have a countingefficiency between 40% and 60% and should berecorded in the calibration report form.9.3.5.5 Particle Size ResolutionNOTE 16: The particle size shall be at least twice the lowercounting limit to ensure measurement of the entiredistribution and accurate characterization of the calibrationresponse curve below the particle size of interest. Theresolution is specified by the coefficient of variation (in %)obtained by dividing the portion of the standard deviation ofthe distribution LPPD that is contributed by the LPPD by themean size of the distribution dp.9.3.5.5.1 Record the size d p and the standard deviationd,p of the used particles in the calibration report form.By running a monodisperse aerosol (with vL and VL =V0 + VG ), determine the standard deviation of theobserved particle distribution p,LPPD . To determine the standard deviation of the pure sensor signal V,LPPD , apulse height analyzer can measure the voltage peaks atthe analog sensor calibration output. The portion of thestandard deviation of the distribution LPPD that iscontributed by the LPPD is calculated by the followingformula: ( ) ( )2,2, pdLPPDpLPPD = 9.3.5.5.2 The value of the standard deviation of theobserved distribution p,LPPD , the standard deviation ofthe sensor signal V,LPPD , and the coefficient ofvariation (in %) should be recorded in the calibrationreport form.9.3.6 Non-Sizing LPPDNOTE 17: For more information and background seeAppendix 2.9.3.6.1 Zero Counting9.3.6.1.1 See Section 9.3.5.2.9.3.6.2 Counting EfficiencyNOTE 18: The actual particle concentration is determinedwith a reference particle counter with a 100% countingefficiency for the employed particle size. It is important thatthere are no differences between the concentration within thedetection area of the LPPD and the concentration monitoredby the RPC.9.3.6.2.1 By running a monodisperse aerosol (using thesmallest particles size which can be counted with vLand VL = V0 + VG ), the maximum of detectedparticles is counted. The counts of the LPPD per mm2detection area compared to the counts of the referenceparticle counter per mm2 detection area (in %) and theemployed particle size should be recorded in thecalibration report form. These measurements should beexecuted for the defined set of particle sizes includingone size no larger than 1.3 times the sensitivity limit asspecified by the manufacturer.9.3.7 Interim Procedure9.3.7.1 Between the settings of the separate thresholdsor the runs with different particle sizes, the systemshould be purged with zero gas for a sufficient time.The aerosol generator should be rinsed with cleandiluent for a sufficient time before adding newsuspension of particles with other size. 10 Calibration Report Form10.1 The calibration report form shall contain thefollowing information:

SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 2003 14 APPENDIX 2CALIBRATION NOTES NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI E104 and was approved by full letter ballotprocedures on July 28, 2000 by the European Regional Standards Committee.A2-1 Size CalibrationA2-1.1 Size calibration is performed withmonodisperse particles with known sizes and knownoptical properties. The procedure establishes thevoltage response of the LPPD for these particles. Thereported size for unknown particles is the same size ofthe monodisperse particle whose voltage response is thevoltage pulse produced by the unknown particle (calledOptical Equivalent Size).A2-1.2 If an LPPD is able to detect all of thedistribution (see counting efficiency) generated by amonodisperse aerosol and the size of the particlestandard is known, the calibrating of an LPPD without areference particle counter is possible. Ideally, the datacollected by the LPPD observing a monodisperseaerosol would describe a Gaussian particle sizedistribution. However, the reported voltage pulse heightdistribution is often not symmetric. Therefore, the modeand modal values of the pulse height distribution arenot equal. The thresholds for different particle sizes areset as the mode or median value of the observeddistribution. The modal voltage method is commonlyused.A2-1.3 The intensity of the scattered light detected bya photodetector depends on intensity, polarization state,and wavelength of the incident light beam, diameter,shape, and refractive index of the particle, as well as onthe geometrical layout of the collection optics anddetector. In the particle size range near the wavelength(0.1 &lt; d P &lt; 10), large oscillations can be seen in theintensity curve of the light scattered by sphericalparticles as a function of all these parameters.Therefore, the response curve might not be monotonic.Particles of more than one size will produce the samevoltage output signal. The calibration particles shouldbe chosen so that their response is not included in suchreversals of the calibration curves.A2-1.4 For calibration checks, a reference particlecounter (RPC) with a good sizing capability could beused. The counting efficiency of the RPC shall be 100%for the particle sizes used in test. The counts of the RPCand the LPPD under test in the corresponding channelshould be normalized to a standard detection area(mm2). A2-2 Particle Size ResolutionA2-2.1 Particle size resolution of a particle detectordescribes its capability to differentiate between particlesof nearly the same size, or it is a measure of the rangeof sizes which the counter would assign to a particularparticle if its size was determined repeatedly. Theresolution is specified by the coefficient of variation (in%) obtained by dividing the portion of the standarddeviation of the distribution LPPD that is contributed bythe LPPD by the mean particle size.A2-2.2 The employed particle size should be at least 2times larger than the lower detection limit of theinstrument and is within a monotonic response range ofthe LPPD response curve. The size d p and the standarddeviation d,p of the used particles is necessary tocalculate the resolution.A2-2.3 To determine the resolution, the standarddeviation of the observed particle distribution p,LPPD iscalculated. The quality of the photodetector is checkedby determining the standard deviation of the puresensor signal V,LPPD at the analog calibration outputwith a pulse height analyzer. The LPPD is calculated bythe following formula: ( ) ( )2,2, pdLPPDpLPPD = A2-3 Zero CountingA2-3.1 The intent of this procedure is not to adjust thethresholds for the zero count rate but to verify whetherthe LPPD is within its specification. It is assumed thatthe zero count level of a correct operating LPPD issufficiently better than its specification. Failure of theverification test is due to a physical failure within theLPPD and not to statistical variation in themeasurement.A2-3.2 The output of a photodetector and theelectronic circuits of the particle detector is afflictedwith noise. The zero count rate verification is carriedout to ensure that data, especially near the detectionlimit of the LPPD, is generated by particles rather thanby noise. To achieve this goal, the basic thresholds forthe LDL are to be set so that a signal-to-noise ratio of atleast 3 dB is ensured. The sampling time shall be longenough to provide adequate sampling statistics.

SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 200315 A2-4 Counting EfficiencyA2-4.1 The counting efficiency for a specific particlesize is defined as the ratio of the detected concentrationof particles to the concentration actually present. Thedetermination of the counting efficiency of an LPPDrequires particles of known size and concentration inthe aerosol. The counting efficiency is affected byseveral factors. First, the counting efficiency is dependent on aspecific particle size. The effect of particle concentration is addressedunder zero counting and coincidence. Due to inhomogeneous light intensity within thedetection area of the particle counter, not all smallparticles near the lower detection limit of theinstrument are detected. If the sampling flow is not completely containedwithin the defined detection area, then someportions of the aerosol will not be counted.A2-4.2 Ideally, the counting efficiency of a particlecounter covering 100% of the line cross-section area asdetection area would consist of a step function at thepoint of the LDL. Real particle detectors have a gradualtransition (efficiency curve) instead of a step function.The point with 50% detection probability of all particlesof a given size moving through the detection area isoften used as a reference point. The correspondingparticle size is called the minimum detectable particlesize (see sensitivity). If the slope of the efficiency curvefor two detectors with the same specified 50%efficiency point is different, the two detectors mayshow different particle counts for the same polydisperseaerosol. To define an efficiency curve, more than oneparticle size, e.g. 5 particle sizes around the LDLcovering 0% to 100% efficiency, should be used.Acceptable counting efficiency for single particlecounting instruments is 50% ± 20% at the minimumdetection size and 100% ± 10% for all particles largerthan 1.5 times the minimum size.A2-4.3 The detection area of most LPPDs comprisesonly a small portions of the cross-section area of theline. Therefore, it is not possible to specify a 50%efficiency point. For this, the commonly used definitionfor sensitivity could not be used for such instruments.A2-4.4 The actual particle concentration is determinedwith a reference particle counter with a 100% countingefficiency for the employed particle size. It is importantthat there are no differences between the concentrationwithin the detection area of the LPPD and theconcentration monitored by the RPC. A2-5 SensitivityA2-5.1 The particle size corresponding to the pointwith 50% counting efficiency of the particles of a givensize is defined as the minimum detectable particle size.This is valid only for particle counters capable to reach100% counting efficiency for a specific particle size.This does not apply to most LPPDs. A2-6 Particle Concentration EffectsA2-6.1 All optical particle detectors are able to operateaccurately only within a limited range of particleconcentration. It is not the scope of this document todefine how this limit is measured or how to verify thespecification.A2-6.2 High Concentration EffectsA2-6.2.1 The upper limitation of the particleconcentration is chiefly based on coincidence effects.A2-6.2.2 One effect is optical coincidence. If theparticle concentration is too high, more than oneparticle is present within the detection area of theinstrument. The reported particle concentration will beless than the true value, and the reported particle sizedistribution will be shifted towards the indication oflarger particles than in reality.A2-6.2.3 The other effect is electronic coincidence. Itis defined as the inability of the electronic pulseprocessing system to detect and size individual pulsesthat are too closely spaced. If there are so many pulsesthat they cannot completely return to the baseline, theybecome superimposed. Electronic saturation occurs.Electronic coincidence introduces errors in both particlesize and counts as well. Normally, this problem is notcritical for modern electronic systems. Opticalcoincidence can become a problem at particle levelswell below the point where electronic saturation occurs.A2-6.2.4 Another error can occur when highconcentrations of particles just smaller than the lowerdetection limit of the instrument are present. Eventhough no single one of these particles will be detected,scattering-light levels from these particles can increasethe background optical noise level. So, errors might beproduced in particle count data in the lower particle sizeranges reported by the counter.A2-6.3 Low Concentration EffectsA2-6.3.1 It is obvious that it is necessary to collectsufficient data to determine number and size of particleswithin an acceptable confidence limit.

These particles aregrown by emulsion polymerization and are stabilized inaqueous suspensions with an anionic surfactant. Theycarry a negative charge which contributes to theirstability. The suspension normally contains 10% solidsand 2% dissolved, highly viscous stabilizer. The solidcontains up to 8% emulsifier and inorganics.A3-1.2 After evaporation, these solids and thestabilizer will both increase the diameter of the singleparticle and generate a residual nucleus out of an emptydroplet. These residual particles are called secondaryaerosol. The diameter of residual nucleus could be up to0.25 m according to the PSL size and dilution of thesuspension. Most of these secondary aerosol particlesmight be too small to be detectable with commonlyused particle detectors, but they will have an influenceon the noise level because of there high number.A3-1.3 Out of a high-concentration suspension it is notpossible to aerosolize only individual particles.Droplets containing more than one of the suspendedparticles will become undesirable agglomerates uponevaporation.A3-1.4 For this, an adequate dilution of the suspensionis necessary to avoid the formation of aggregates andthe enlargement of the particles. A3-2 Generation and Dilution of PSLSuspensionA3-2.1 A diluted PSL suspension for particlegeneration in an aerosol generator can be created by thefollowing procedure: Shaking and/or ultrasonic treatment of the PSLbottle distributed by the PSL manufacturer. Placing one drop of PSL in one liter of deionizedor destilled water or Isopropanol. The water couldbe cleaned using a filter with a pore size no morethan 10% of the size of the particles being used. Shaking and/or ultrasonic treatment of thesuspension to disperse the particles.A3-2.2 The suspension will probably need to be dilutedfurther to provide a required particle concentration.This is necessary to avoid the formation ofagglomerates and to restrict the size of the secondary aerosol particles. An equation to calculate the requiredparticle concentration is given in The Generation ofAerosols of Fine Particles by O. Raabe (see Section11).A3-2.3 The particle suspensions distributed by the PSLmanufacturer shows no detectable variation in particlecharacteristics when they are stored in a cool place overthe years. Diluted suspensions for atomization featurean aging process. Diluted suspensions of polymerspheres smaller than 1 m should not be stored formore than one week.NOTE A3-1: Care should be taken to avoid contamination ofthe polymer spheres and the suspension. A3-3 Aerosol GenerationA3-3.1 The diluted suspension is nebulized in theaerosol generator. Great account is taken ofconcentration and size distribution of the generateddroplets and of the volume flow rate VG . To achieve aconstant aerosol production, the volume flow rate andthe droplet size distribution should be constant andindependent of the supplies of suspension in thereservoir. The variation in particle concentration shouldbe no more than 10% as measured by the referenceparticle counter over a time period of 15 minutes ormore.NOTE A3-2: Care should be taken to avoid contamination ofthe aerosol generator. A3-4 Aerosol DryingA3-4.1 The water of the generated droplets willcompletely evaporate when the relative humidity of theaerosol flow behind the nebulizer is lower than 70%.The volume flow of the suspension in the nozzleincreases the humidity of the filtered compressed airwhich has a relative humidity of 10%15% in spite ofpredrying. The use of a diffusion dryer or anotherappropriate instrument allows a higher relativehumidity of the aerosol flow behind the aerosolgenerator. The diffusion dryer uses silica gel desiccantto remove the moisture. The desiccant shall either benew or freshly regenerated. It is not wise to get theaerosol in direct contact with the desiccant. Polymerspheres will be precipitated and additional particles outof the desiccant will change the particle sizedistribution of the aerosol.

SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 200317 A3-5 Aerosol NeutralizationA3-5.1 When dispersing the suspension, the particlesare charged. This surface charge should be removedafter drying the aerosol flow to avoid electrostaticinteractions with each other or the line walls. With thehelp of the discharging distance of an electrostaticneutralizer, the aerosol is exposed to a bipolar ionsource. Some electrostatic neutralizers may produce alarge number of ultra-fine particles which will combinewith the calibration aerosol and affects the signal-to-noise-ratio of the LPPD and the reference particlecounter. A3-6 Aerosol Size SeparationA3-6.1 When calibrating with ultra-fine particles, aparticle size separation might be necessary to removethe residue particles and agglomerates. An electrostaticclassifier is most effective for particle sizes less than 1m. This instrument electrically charges the incomingaerosol. With electrostatic deflection, it separatesselected particles of one mobility. The residue particlesand the larger aggregate particles would be stripped outof the particle stream consisting of the desired polymerparticles. To charge the aerosol, the electrostaticclassifier uses a radioactive neutralizer. The aerosolexiting the instrument will contain singly chargedparticles. This low charge level makes the use of anadditional aerosol neutralizer unnecessary.Nevertheless, conductive tubing should be usedbetween the aerosol generator and the LPPD andreference particle counter to minimize electrostaticparticle loss. A3-7 Aerosol DilutionA3-7.1 The particle concentration of the aerosolgenerated by the nebulizer might be too high. Theaerosol should be further diluted to achieve the requiredconcentration and to avoid coincidence errors. Thedilution could be executed with a mixing chamber inwhich the aerosol is mixed with zero gas. The internalchamber pressure should be stable and very close toambient atmospheric pressure at operational flow rates.The spatial particle distribution in the exiting aerosolshould be as homogenous as possible.

SEMI E104-0303 © SEMI 2000, 2003 18 APPENDIX 4AEROSOL TRANSPORT AND AEROSOL SAMPLING NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI E104 and was approved by full letter ballotprocedures on July 28, 2000 by the European Regional Standards Committee.A4-1 Aerosol TransportA4-1.1 Aerosol loss in lines occurs both for small andlarger particles. Larger particles (approximately 5 mand larger) are lost as a result of gravitational settling inhorizontal lines and inertial effects in all lines. Smallerparticles are lost to the line walls by diffusion and byelectrostatic charge effects.A4-1.2 A limitation of particle loss could be achievedwith tubing as short and as straight as possible with nobends with a radius of curvature less than 100 mm. Thetubing of the calibration setup should be smooth,conductive, and electrically grounded. Stainless,polished steel for rigid lines and Polyurethane orpolyvinyl chloride for flexible lines is found acceptablefor handling most aerosols with low electrostaticparticle loss. If long transit lines are required, theyshould be sized to permit a Reynolds number in therange of 5,000 to 25,000 at the sample flow rate tominimize particle residence time in the tubing withoutcausing excessive turbulence at high flow rates. A4-2 Aerosol Sample AcquisitionA4-2.1 The term isokinetic sampling often is used inaerosol measurement and characterization. Isokineticsampling of particles in a moving aerosol is performedby matching the sample probe inlet velocity (flow speedand direction) to the velocity of the moving aerosol. Atvelocities less than 15 m/s, anisokinetic sampling errorsare negligible for most particles smaller thanapproximately 5 m. Losses of larger particles might besignificant. The larger the particle, the larger the lossdue to inertial effects. Isokinetic sampling is notpossible in environmental conditions with varyingvelocity, motionless air, and turbulent, random, or non-unidirectional flow. For better sampling inlet efficiency,isokinetic or at least isoaxial sampling is recommendedat calibration.

However, this picture is greatly over-simplified. For example, a front-opening shipping box(FOSB) compliant with SEMI M31 (with its thickerdoor) generally cannot be opened by equipment loadports that are compliant with SEMI E63. Also, a wirelink to an OHT for the carrier handoff parallel I/O canalso be located at the top of the equipment.Furthermore, the atmospheric wafer handler foremptying the carrier will generally be different from thewafer handler used in the vacuum environment of thecentral handler module of a cluster tool.6.2 Kinematic Coupling  The foundational documentof the SEMI standards for 300 mm physical interfacesand carriers is SEMI E57 which specifies themechanical couplings used to ergonomically align andprecisely support 300 mm wafer carriers. Thekinematic coupling consists of three pins that mate withgrooves on the bottom of the wafer carrier (which arenot specified) for physical alignment and support. Mostof the dimensions in the SEMI standards for 300 mmphysical interfaces and carriers are determined withrespect to the three orthogonal datum planes defined inSEMI E57: the horizontal datum plane, the facial datumplane, and the bilateral datum plane. Such a kinematiccoupling can be used at several interfaces, including: between a FOUP or cassette and an equipment loadport or vehicle nest, between a transport cassette and a box, and between a process cassette or quartz boat and thefloor of a process chamber.

&lt;!-- Page 37 --&gt;

SEMI E106-1104 © SEMI 2000, 20045 6.3 Wafer Carriers  SEMI E1.9 and SEMI E47.1specify the carriers used to transport and store 300 mmwafers in an IC manufacturing facility. SEMI E47.1specifies the outside features of the front-openingunified pod (FOUP). The inside features of the FOUPare specified in SEMI E1.9, which also specifies theopen cassette. Both standards specify carriers that holdeither 13 or 25 wafers. SEMI M31 specifies the front-opening shipping box (FOSB) used to transport andship 300 mm wafers. SEMI E103 specifies a systemthat includes a box that holds only one wafer and thatfits onto an adapter mechanism called a single-waferinterface (SWIF). This system appears to theequipment to be a 300 mm FOUP (except that only thevolume around the middle wafer may be accessible).6.4 Equipment Load Ports  SEMI E15.1 specifiesthe carrier load ports at the front of 300 mm process ormetrology equipment (or stockers). In addition, thesubstrate port that opens a FOUP door is specified inSEMI E62 (FIMS). At the floor below each load port isa cart docking interface exclusion volume specified inSEMI E64; this volume can contain a PGV dockingflange as specified in SEMI E83. SEMI E63 (BOLTS-M) or SEMI E92 (BOLTS-Light) or both standardsspecify the mechanical interface between the main partof a process or metrology tool and the boxopener/loader unit that opens FOUPs and presents themto the tool wafer handler for unloading and loading 300mm wafers. Also associated with each load port is awire or optical link (from the equipment to the AMHScarrier delivery system) specified in SEMI E84 whichis the 300 mm version of SEMI E23. SEMI E99 andSEMI E99.1 specify the electronics and communicationinterface between a carrier ID reader/writer and theequipment controller. SEMI E101 specifies thefunctional structure model and component behavior forthe entire equipment front-end module (EFEM). SEMIE110 specifies the placement of indicators and switch.6.5 Cluster-Tools  SEMI standards for 300 mmcluster tools include SEMI E22.1, SEMI E21.1, SEMIE26.1, and SEMI E25.6.6 AMHS  SEMI standards for automated materialhandling systems (AMHS) include SEMI E85.6.7 Equipment Volume and Weight  SEMI E72specifies limits on the footprint, height, and weight ofequipment for 300 mm fabs. Separate limits are givenfor the parts of the equipment in the main fab and in thesub-fab. Separate limits are also given for theequipment after it is installed and for the components ofthe equipment as it is moved into the fab.6.8 Back-End Standards  SEMI G74 specifies thetape frames used for 300 mm wafers between the dicingprocess and the die-bonding process. SEMI G77 specifies the mechanical features of a metal or plasticframe cassette used for framed 300 mm wafers betweenthe wafer mounting process and the die-bondingprocess. Future standards may also specify the carrierfor thinned 300 mm wafers and the load port for back-end process or metrology equipment.6.9 Standards of Uncertain Use  Some SEMI 300mm standards that passed balloting have a scope ofapplication or extent of use that is yet to be fullydetermined. Such standards include SEMI M29 whichspecifies a manually-opening shipping box for 300 mmwafers. In the other SEMI 300 mm standards are alsosome options of uncertain use such as bottom-openingpods and pods with removable cassettes. 7 Application of Standards to Products7.1 One-Sided Interface Specifications  The SEMIstandards for 300 mm physical interfaces and carriersare intended to set an appropriate level of specificationthat places minimal limits on innovation while ensuringmodularity and inter-changeability between differenttypes of products. To accomplish this, only one side ofeach mechanical interface (between different types ofproducts) is specified, leaving the supplier of theproduct on the other side of the interface more freedomto improve their product. For example, only the bottomhalf of the kinematic coupling (the pin) is specified bySEMI E57 so that suppliers can be flexible in designingwafer carrier grooves that can mate with it. Table 1shows which standards apply to each type of productand shows which side of the interface is specified: D indicates if the standard directly specifies thattype of product (by specifying that products sideof the relevant interface). I indicates if the standard indirectly specifies thattype of product (by specifying the other side of therelevant interface).7.2 Carriers  A FOUP is directly specified by SEMIE47.1 (for its outside features not including the door)and by SEMI E1.9 (for its inside features). The FOUPis indirectly specified by SEMI E57 (for its kinematiccoupling grooves) and by SEMI E62 (for its FIMS doorinterface). Thus, if a FOUP door fails to open or closecorrectly on any load port that complies with SEMI E57and SEMI E62, that FOUP is in violation of thestandards. The wafer support function of all of the 300mm carriers is specified directly (by specifying wherethe wafers must be located rather than specifying theshape and location of the supports), so the 300 mmwafer standards indirectly specify the carriers.7.3 Stockers  A carrier stocker is directly specifiedby SEMI E57 (for the kinematic coupling pins on itsshelves, if any, and on its manual/AGV/RGV and

&lt;!-- Page 38 --&gt;

SEMI E106-1104 © SEMI 2000, 2004 6 interbay load ports), by SEMI E15.1 (for itsmanual/AGV/RGV load ports), by SEMI E85 (for itsinterbay load ports), by SEMI E84 (for its carrierhandoff parallel I/O at either kind of load port) and bySEMI E64 (for the cart docking interface exclusionvolume below each manual/AGV/RGV load port). Thecarrier stocker is indirectly specified by the carrierstandards (for the volume required to store and transferthe carriers).7.4 Carrier ID  A carrier ID reader/writer unit isdirectly specified by a future standard that specifies theelectronics and communication interface between acarrier ID reader/writer and the equipment controller.The carrier ID reader/writer unit is indirectly specifiedby the carrier standards (which specify reserved areasfor carrier ID tags) and by SEMI E15.1 (for itsexclusion volume in each load port).7.5 Load Port and Carrier Handler Modules  A boxopener/loader (the module on a piece of equipment thatincludes load ports and carrier handling) is directlyspecified by SEMI E57 (for the kinematic coupling pinson the load port and on its shelves if it includes aninternal buffer in addition to its fixed buffer), by SEMIE15.1 (for its load ports), by SEMI E62 (for its FIMSdoor interface), by SEMI E84 (for its carrier handoffparallel I/O), by SEMI E64 (for the cart dockinginterface exclusion volume below each load port), bySEMI E72 (for its limits on footprint, height, andweight), and by SEMI E110 (for indicator/switchplacement). The module is indirectly specified by the carrier standards (for the volume required to store andtransfer the carriers) and by SEMI E63 and/or SEMIE92 (for the mechanical interface to the main part of theprocess or metrology equipment that contains thesubstrate handler).7.6 Main Part of Process or Metrology Equipment The main part of process or metrology equipment(including the substrate handler) is directly specified bySEMI E63 and/or SEMI E92 (for the mechanicalinterface to the module that includes load ports andcarrier handling) and by SEMI E72 (for its limits onfootprint, height, and weight). The substrate handler isindirectly specified by SEMI E1.9 (for the featuresinside most carriers) and it is recommended to followthe direct specifications in SEMI E22.1 (whichspecifies cluster-tool end effectors).7.7 Material Handling Systems  A carrier transportvehicle is directly specified by SEMI E57 (for thekinematic coupling pins on the carrier nest, if any) andby SEMI E84 (for its carrier handoff parallel I/O, ifany). The AMHS system is indirectly specified by thecarrier standards (for the volume required to hold andtransfer the carriers), by SEMI E15.1 (for equipmentload ports), by SEMI E85 (for stocker load ports, if it isan OHT), by SEMI E72 (to allow for equipment height,if it is an OHT), and by SEMI E64 and SEMI E83 (forthe cart docking interface exclusion volume and thePGV docking flange, respectively, below eachequipment load port, if it is a floor based vehicle).

SEMI E108-0301 © SEMI 20011 SEMI E108-0301TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANICCONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GASCHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY This test method was technically approved by the Global Metrics Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the European Equipment Automation Committee. Current edition approved by the European RegionalStandards Committee on December 20, 2000. Initially available at www.semi.org February 2001; to bepublished March 2001. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this standard is to define a testmethod for the determination of the outgassing organiccontamination from minienvironments used for storageand transport of wafers using gas chromatography/massspectroscopy (GC/MS).1.2 This test method is intended as an alternative toSEMI E46. The main difference between SEMI E46and this document is that SEMI E46 defines a testmethod which is based on ion mobility spectroscopy(IMS) as the measurement technique while thisstandard is based on gas chromatography/massspectroscopy in combination with thermal desorption.Additionally, this test method provides a procedure fortesting the outgassing of organic compounds in acomplete minienvironment. The results of SEMI E46and this document are given in different units. 2 Scope2.1 The test method provided in th is document isapplicable to the assessment of the outgassing oforganic contamination from minienvironments.2.2 Gas chromatography/mass spe ctroscopy is chosenas the method to determine organic contaminationbecause it is commonly used for characterization andquantification of organic compounds. In combinationwith thermal desorption, it provides a method for theidentification of organic compounds in the atmosphere(i.e., inside the minienvironment) as well as directlyfrom source materials, and transferred contaminants.This method can also be used to evaluate materials andprocesses used in semiconductor industry.2.3 This test method is based on A STM F1982.2.4 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 The test methodologies, metric s and applicationsprovided in this standard are limited by the followingconstraints:3.1.1 The specific recovery of comp ounds by theproposed standard method strongly depends on thesetup of the apparatus used. This has been taken intoaccount by the use of the reference-cocktail, seeSection 9.2.3.2 Identification of the source of organic compoundsinside the minienvironment is out of the scope of thistest method. For a procedure for the analysis ofoutgassing organic compounds from individualmaterials using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy,see IDEMA M11-99.3.3 This test method does not prov ide a procedure howto use the obtained data for assessing the risks thatcome from individual compounds. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E46  Test Method for the Determination ofOrganic Contamination from MinienvironmentsSEMI F21  Classification of Airborne MolecularContaminant Levels in Clean Environments4.2 ASTM Standard1 ASTM F1982  Standard Test Methods for AnalyzingOrganic Contaminants on Silicon Wafer Surfaces byThermal Desorption Gas Chromatography.4.3 IDEMA Standard2 IDEMA M11-99  General Outgas Test Procedure byDynamic Headspace Analysis 1 American Society for Testing and Materials, 100 Barr HarborDrive, West Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959, website: www.astm.org2 International Disk Drive Equipment and Materials Association,3255 Scott Blvd., Suite 2-102, Santa Clara, CA 95054-3013, website:www.idema.org

SEMI E108-0301 © SEMI 2001 2 NOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 5 Terminology5.1 analytical environment  env ironment where allanalytical measurements are taking place.5.2 headspace sampling  in this standard defined as:collecting volatile organic compounds in an enclosedvolume by means of a silicon wafer or silicon waferchips.5.3 minienvironment  A localize d environment fortransport and storage created by an enclosure to isolatethe product from contamination and people.5.4 sample  wafer or wafer chip s used for theheadspace sampling of organic contaminants.5.5 static storage conditions  co nditions excludingany active movement of test specimens.5.6 thermal desorption tube  An alytical equipmentcapable of collecting organic compounds of interest(i.e., adsorbent filled glass tube).5.7 wafer  Object made of semi conducting materialto be processed, handled or stored in theminienvironment to be tested (i.e., prime or processedsilicon wafer). 6 Summary of Method6.1 This test method comprises sto rage tests of wafersin minienvironments under static storage conditions.The contamination is directly measured from the siliconwafer surface. Three important aspects are covered:a) Contamination due to the minienvironment alone,b) Contamination from the use of minienvironments forwafer processing, andc) Contamination from future materials to be used insemiconductor technology.6.2 The setup for each test compri ses an analyticalequipment in the analytical environment as well as atest equipment in the test environment. Eachenvironment has to fulfill the following requirements:6.2.1 Analytical Environment  sha ll be clean enoughwith respect to airborne organic contamination:recommendation is less than 100 pptM for organiccompounds with boiling points &gt; 150°C (Class MC-100, according to SEMI F21).6.2.2 Test Environment  shall equ al the environmentin which the test specimen will be used.6.3 Silicon wafers are placed in th e minienvironmentor used for headspace sampling experiments. These wafer samples are then analyzed by gas chromatogra-phy/mass spectrometry to determine the amount ofcontaminants.6.4 The wafers or wafer chips to b e used for the testmethod are decontaminated as described in ASTMF1982 for bare silicon wafers. The surface condition ofthe wafer (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) has to beadjusted in a reproducible way and has to be the samefor all comparative measurements.6.5 The wafer or the wafer chips a re placed in theminienvironment and are left there under staticconditions for the chosen static storage time (dependingon the intended use of the minienvironment to be tested,a time between 1 h and 28 d may be used). Whenloaded into the minienvironment the wafer may have atemperature which reflects production circumstances(i.e., 80°C when unloading from furnace processes). Insome situations wafers may be exposed to severethermal conditions. The minienvironment should beevaluated under the conditions exposed to. Be sure thatthe material to be tested does not undergo phasetransitions under the chosen temperature conditions.6.6 After the static storage test per iod, the wafer isreturned to the analytical equipment and the organiccontamination on the wafer is measured immediately.6.7 The quantitative value for the total amount ofoutgassed and adsorbed organics from the minienviron-ment is calculated as the difference between thedetected amount of contamination on a blank samplevs. the amount on the exposed sample. 7 Interferences7.1 The presence of organic conta mination in theatmosphere of the test environment may lead to asignificant contribution to the detected total amount oforganic compounds on the test wafers or wafer chips.Care has to be taken when subtracting the blank valuefrom the test value. Transport times from testenvironment to analytical environment have to be asshort as possible. 8 Apparatus8.1 For the analysis of organic com pounds on wafers agas chromatography/mass spectroscopy apparatus withthermal desorption unit is required: A gaschromatography (GC) instrument, which utilizes acapillary column to separate a wide variety of organiccompounds, combined with mass spectrometer (MS). Athermal desorption unit is used to desorb organics fromsample thermal desorption tubes and collect them in atrap. Two types of trapping may be used:

&lt;!-- Page 46 --&gt;

SEMI E108-0301 © SEMI 20013 a) cooling the trap down to a minimum of -150°C doesnot require any adsorbent (glass wool may be used) orb) a Tenax® filled trap has to be cooled down to aminimum of -25°C.8.1.1 The thermal desorption unit is coupled to the gaschromatography instrument via a heated transfer line.This apparatus may be used directly for the desorptionfrom wafer chips which are put in empty glass (orstainless steel) thermo desorption tubes (method A).8.1.2 A desorption unit for complete wafers isspecified in ASTM F1982. In this case sample thermaldesorption tubes packed with adsorbent have to be usedto trap compounds desorbed from the wafer. Thesethermal desorption tubes are analyzed within thethermal desorption unit (method B).8.2 The analysis of outgassing org anic contaminationfrom minienvironments requires an extremely sensitiveanalytical equipment. Recovery and limit of detectionfor the different classes of compounds must beevaluated carefully in order to ensure reliable results. 9 Reagents and Materials9.1 For the materials used for hand ling and transportof wafers clean, decontaminated equipment has to beused, e.g. tweezers heated in a propane flame. Refer tothe reagent and materials described in SEMI E46 andASTM F1982.9.2 Test Mixture  For the calibra tion of equipmentand the quantification of the amount of contamination atest mixture (cocktail) is used. This mixture waschosen in order to give an average over typicalsubstance classes present in semiconductor productionlines, which have high sticking factors to the wafersurface. The response factor of the MS-detection fororganics varies significantly. As this is true for allcontaminants, the method gives a realistic trustworthyquantitative correlation to a typical average compoundmixture of contaminants on wafer surfaces.9.3 Preparation of Test Mixture9.3.1 The mixture consists of triethy l phosphate,-caprolactam, palmitic acid and diethylhexyl phthalateeach 0.5 g/l in isooctane (as solvent). Thepreparation has to be done according to SEMI E46.NOTE 2: A similar test mixture is suggested by the workinggroup WG 031 of the Institute for Environmental Science andTechnology (IEST) 10 Safety Precautions10.1 All preparation and analytical work has to bedone according to local safety regulations. 11 Preparation of Minienviro nment andSample11.1 Minienvironment  The minie nvironment to betested has to be used as received from the supplier. Acleaning step can be added but there must be nocontribution from the cleaning procedure to theoutgassing of organic compounds from theminienvironment. The cleaning method has to bedefined by the supplier or agreed upon between supplierand user of the tested minienvironment.11.2 Sample  The wafers shall be made organic-freebefore using them to monitor organic contamination.The surface condition of the wafer (hydrophobic orhydrophilic) has to be adjusted in a reproducible wayand has to be the same for comparative measurements.Refer to SEMI E46 and ASTM F1982. 12 Procedure12.1 The procedure described below is used forobtaining the baseline value of the method (methodblank) as well as the test value for outgassing organiccompounds of the minienvironment within a definedstatic storage time (storage time tS = 1 h - 28 d).12.1.1 Choose that static storage time according to theintended use of the minienvironment (i.e., if themaximum sit time of wafers in a process where theminienvironment is to be used is 4 h then choose astatic storage time of 4 h). If no static storage timerelated to processes can be defined, a recommendedvalue for the first static storage time is 1 day.NOTE 3: Composition of adsorbed compounds may vary withstatic storage time.12.2 For transport store the wafers o r wafer chips usedfor testing in decontaminated, organic-free petri-disheswrapped in organic-free aluminum foil. Refer to SEMIE46.12.3 Loading Procedure12.3.1 For tests at room temperature : open aminienvironment to be tested and load it with adecontaminated wafer using decontaminated handlingtools (i.e., tweezers). Default storage location is thecenter slot of the minienvironment. Close theminienvironment. Leave the minienvironment closedfor the chosen static storage time.12.3.2 For tests at elevated temperatu res using awafer furnace: place the decontaminated wafers in aclean furnace used for production processes and heatthe wafers under inert gas to a temperature &gt; 120°C.Turn off the heating. When the temperature of thefurnace has reached (90±10)°C open theminienvironment to be tested and fully load it with the

&lt;!-- Page 47 --&gt;

SEMI E108-0301 © SEMI 2001 4 hot wafers from the furnace. Close theminienvironment. Leave it closed for the chosen staticstorage time. For analysis use only one wafer. Defaultwafer is the one in the center slot.12.3.3 For tests at elevated temperatu res using aheating chamber: open the minienvironment to betested and load it with a decontaminated wafer usingdecontaminated handling tools (i.e., tweezers). Defaultlocation is the center slot. Close the minienvironment.Wrap the minienvironment with decontaminatedaluminum foil. Place the minienvironment in an inertand clean heating chamber heated to 70°C. Leave it for1 h and then remove it from the heating chamber andplace it at the test minienvironment. Leave it thereclosed for the chosen static storage time.NOTE 4: The purpose of the aluminum foil is to preventdirect contact between the recirculating hot air inside theheating chamber and the minienvironment.12.4 Unloading Procedure  Open the minienviron-ment and unload the wafer using decontaminatedhandling tools into decontaminated petri-dishes andwrap them into organic-free aluminum foil. Transportthe wafer immediately to the measurement equipmentand analyze the organic contamination on the waferaccording to the standard ASTM F1982.12.5 Method Blank  Perform the test sequence usinga container made completely of glass or quartz insteadof the minienvironment. Use the same static storagetime for the method blank but perform this blank test atroom temperature. The container has to bedecontaminated with respect to organics inside by heattreatment (refer to SEMI E46). With this blank methodthe baseline contribution from the cleanroom air on theadsorption of organic contamination on the siliconwafer surface is determined.12.6 Analyzing Procedure  Put th e wafer or waferchips in the precleaned desorption unit or thermaldesorption tube and heat it for 10 min to a minimum of275°C (but 400°C is better). The desorbed contam-inants have to be trapped directly with the cold trap ofthe thermodesorption unit (method A) or first byadsorbent filled desorption tubes and then by the coldtrap (method B). Desorption parameters for adsorbentfilled desorption tube and cold trap may be taken fromASTM F1982 (see also Section 12.6.1).12.6.1 The substances desorbed shou ld be separatedby an appropriate column temperature program. Arecommended temperature program for standardanalysis uses a polydimethylsiloxane/polydiphenyl-siloxane (95/5) coated column (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25m), heated from 50 oC to 250 oC at a rate of 10 oC/minfollowed by a temperature hold at 250 oC for 10 min. Column flow should be about 1 ml/min He at constantflow.12.6.2 All parameters (thermo desorp tion unit, gaschromatograph, mass spectrometer) should be set toyield the recommended detection limits and recoveryrates (see Calibration Procedure Section 13.2).12.7 Materials Testing  Materials testing can bedone, using the sample preparation described in SEMIE46, but using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopyinstead of IMS for the analysis of contaminants on thetest wafers or wafer chips.12.8 Perform the procedure for cali bration, methodblank and test (including sample preparation) intriplicate in order to obtain mean value and standarddeviation for the analysis. 13 Calibration and System P erformance13.1 Calibration  The test mixtur e (2 l liquid,equals 1 g of each substance; see Section 9.3) isapplied to the wafer or wafer chips as described inSEMI E46. The so produced reference wafer or waferchips are handled in the same way as the samples. Thatmeans, they are put in the precleaned desorption unit orthermal desorption tube and heated for 10 min tominimum 275°C (but 400°C is better) and so on asdescribed in Section 12.6.13.2 System Performance  All pa rameters(thermodesorption unit, gas chromatograph, massspectrometer) should be set to yield the specifieddetection limits and recovery rates (method B) for thecomponents of the reference mixture. The limit ofdetection (3) must equal or be better than 250 ng foreach of the four reference substances. The standarddeviation (inaccuracy) of the calibration must be≤ 10%. Sample measurements are not allowed, unlessthese requirements are fulfilled. For samplemeasurements the same parameters as for thecalibration measurements have to be used. 14 Quantification14.1 Integration  After the analys is measure thesurface area (As) of the tested wafer or wafer chips.Summing up all the peak areas from gaschromatography/mass spectroscopy chromatogram ofthe wafer or wafer chips gives the total integral (I s).Determine the total integral (I b) of the blank wafer andthe total integral of the four peaks of the gaschromatography/mass spectroscopy chromatogram ofthe test mixture (Ir ) with the same technique.
