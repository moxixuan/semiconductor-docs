Repeated certification at yearly or longer intervals\ncan be used to establish reliability. A hygrometer which\nhas  been  certified  by  a  national  standards  laboratory  to\n1  ppm  (or  lower)  moisture  in  air  or  nitrogen,  and  for\nwhich  reliability  has  been  established  over  a  period\ngreater  than  or  equal  to  that  which  has  elasped  since\ncertification  occurred,  is  acceptable  for  validation  of  a\nmoisture standard and will be referred to as a \u201cprimary\u201d\nhygrometer.\nBecause  hygrometers  which  are  suitable  for  use  as\nprimary  hygrometers  may  be  less  convenient  or  less\nreadily  available  than  other  hygrometers,  the  use  of\nother  hygrometers  for  validation  is  also  acceptable,\nprovided  adequate  precautions  are  taken  to  ensure  that\nthey  are  operating  correctly.  These  precautions  (to  be\ndescribed  below)  require  using  a  moisture  source  to\ncompare   a   secondary   hygrometer   with   the   primary\nhygrometer.  The  moisture  source  need  not  have  been\nvalidated in this case.\n6. 2.2  Validation     of     Secondary     Hygrometers     \u2014\nSecondary hygrometers may be validated by comparing\ntheir output with a primary hygrometer when connected\nin  parallel  to  the  same  moisture  source.  The  degree  of\nagreement   required   can   vary   depending   upon   the\nprecision  to  be  claimed,  but  in  any  case  the  difference\nin  reading  between  the  two  hygrometers  should  be  no\nmore  than  10%  at  any  point.  Comparison  should  be\nmade  at  four  moisture  concentrations  or  at  two  per\ndecade of proposed operation, whichever is less. Half of\nthe   comparisons   should   be   made   while   increasing\nconcentration  and  half  while  decreasing,  including  at\nleast   one   comparison   at   the   highest   point   of   the\nconcentration  range.  The  first  and  last  comparisons\nshould be at the lowest point of the concentration range.\nFor  example,  in  order  to  validate  a  hygrometer  for\noperation   between   1   and   100   ppm,   it   would   be\nacceptable to generate moisture levels at 1, 30, 100, 50,\n1 ppm (in that order) and compare the primary with the\nsecondary  hygrometer.  Comparison  of  the  measured\nlevel  between  the  two  1  ppm  tests  provides  a  ready\nindication  of  hysteresis  in  the  system.  If  the  secondary\nhygrometer requires calibration using its own standard,\ncalibration    should    be    effected    before    validation.\nHowever,  it  is  acceptable  to  adjust  the  calibration  in"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI C15-95 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2002 3\norder    to    improve    agreement    with    the    primary\nhygrometer.\n6. 2.3  Frequency   of   Hygrometer   Validation   \u2014   The\nfrequency   of   validation   required   for   a   secondary\nhygrometer  will  vary  dependent  upon  the  performance\nestablished  for  hygrometers  of  the  same  general  type.\nIf three successive monthly validations show continuing\nagreement  (within  10%)  with  the  primary  hygrometer\nwithout  calibration  adjustment,  the  validation  interval\nmay be extended to three months. Similar extensions of\nvalidation  interval  to  six  months  and  one  year  may  be\nmade   if   no   drift   is   apparent   and   no   calibration\nadjustments are necessary to bring the secondary within\n10% of the primary at all points.\n6. 3  Validation Procedure for Moisture Standards\n6. 3.1  Validation  Within  the  Range  of  an  Available\nPrimary  Hygrometer  \u2014  If  a  primary  hygrometer  is\navailable,  and  its  detection  limit  is  no  higher  than  the\nlowest  concentration  at  which  it  is  desired  to  use  the\nmoisture  standard,  this  is  the  simplest  case.  Use  the\nstandard  to  generate  four  concentration  levels  or  two\nper  decade  (whichever  is  less)  in  which  the  standard\nwill be used, half of the concentrations generated while\nincreasing    concentration,    half    while    decreasing,\nincluding at least one comparison at the highest point of\nthe  concentration  range.  The  first  and  last  comparisons\nshould be at the lowest point of the concentration range.\nIf the generated levels, calculated according to the basic\nproperties   of   the   generator   (e.g.,   weight   loss   of   a\npermeation  tube)  agree  with  the  measured  levels  to\nwithin  10%,  the  standard  may  be  considered  validated\nwith  an  accuracy  of  10%.  Higher  validation  accuracy\nrequires better agreement. It has been assumed that the\nprecision  of  the  primary  hygrometer,  as  determined  by\na  national  standards  laboratory,  is  much  better  than\n10%  and  may  be  neglected  for  validation  at  the  10%\nlevel.  Validation  at  higher  accuracy  requires  explicit\nconsideration of the certification precision.\nIf a standard only generates one level, connect it to the\nhygrometer    and    allow    to    come    to    equilibrium.\nAssuming   the   equilibrium   level   agrees   with   the\ncalculated   level   of   the   generator,   disconnect   the\nhygrometer  and  bring  it  to  equilibrium  with  either  dry\nnitrogen  or  ambient  air.  Then  reconnect  the  moisture\nstandard   and   reestablish   equilibrium   between   the\nstandard  and  the  hygrometer.  Disconnect  again  and\nrepeat  a  third  time.    If  the  three  measurements  agree\nwithin  10%  among  themselves  and  with  the  generated\nlevel, the standard is validated.\nIt is implicit in the above that the background moisture\nlevel of the system be less than 50 ppb so that it can be\nneglected  for  all  measurements  above  1  ppm  with  an\nerror   no   larger   than   5%.   We   can   usually   neglect\nbackground  moisture  in  validating  moisture  standards\nin this concentration range.\n6. 3.2  Validation  Using  Secondary  Hygrometers  \u2014  If\nno primary hygrometer is available, then validation can\nbe  performed  using  a  secondary  hygrometer.    If  the\nlowest concentration to be generated using the standard\nis  no  higher  than  the  detection  limit  of  the  primary\nhygrometer   used   for   validation   of   the   secondary\nhygrometer, then the procedure is as above, except that\nthe  secondary  must  first  have  been  validated  over  the\nentire  concentration  range  which  the  standard  will  be\nused   to   generate.   (A   secondary   hygrometer   and   a\nmoisture  standard  can  be  validated  simultaneously  if\nthe  primary  and  secondary  hygrometers  are  connected\nin parallel to the moisture standard.)\nWhen  assessing  the  accuracy  of  validation  using  a\nsecondary   hygrometer,   it   is   necessary   to   take   into\naccount the precision of the comparison of the primary\nhygrometer  with  the  secondary  hygrometer  as  well  as\nthe  precision  of  the  comparison  of  the  generator  with\nthe secondary hygrometer.\n7  Practice for Generating ppb Moisture\nStandards\nThe  detection  limit  of  the  primary  hygrometer  will\ngenerally  be  on  the  order  of  1  ppm,  whereas  it  will\nfrequently  be  necessary  to  use  the  moisture  standard  at\nconcentrations below this level, by a factor of as much\nas   10,000.   Therefore,   valid   methods   for   reducing\nconcentration are necessary.\n7. 1  Dilution  of  Validated  Moisture  Standards  \u2014  If  a\nmoisture standard validated in accordance with Section\n6. 2  or  Section  6.2.1  is  diluted  with  a  zero  gas  stream\nsatisfying  the  criteria  of  Section  5.3,  then  the  resultant\ndiluted  standard  may  be  considered  valid  and  may  be\nused for calibration of analyzers, such as APIMS.\n7. 2  Consideration  of  Background  Moisture  \u2014  In  any\nppb  or  lower  moisture  measurement,  it  is  necessary  to\nconsider    the    background    moisture    level    due    to\noutgassing   in   the   sampling   system   and   residual\nmoisture   in   the   generator   +   analyzer.   Often   the\nbackground  will  be  sufficiently  large  that  it  must  be\ntaken into account explicitly. The background moisture\nlevel  is  the  moisture  concentration  measured  in  the\nabsence  of  a  moisture  source  (i.e.,  when  the  driest\ncarrier  gas  available  is  fed  to  the  analyzer  using  the\nsame flow rate and flow path as is used for the sample\ngas during analysis).\nIt   should   be   noted   that   the   importance   of   the\nbackground  level  increases  for  measurements  at  low\nconcentrations,   and   that   the   background   level   is\nsensitive  to  the  materials  of  construction,  to  the  design"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI C15-95 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2002 4\nof   the   moisture   generator,   and   to   its   operating\ntemperature.\nIf  the  background  moisture  concentration  is  B  (ppb),\nthe  concentration  delivered  by  the  moisture  standard  is\nC (ppb) and the dilution factor x is given by\nx=\nflow of moisture standard\ntotal flow\n(1)"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"then c, the delivered moisture concentration is given (in\nppb) by\nc=(1\u2212x)B+xC             (2)"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"The  accuracy  of  calibration  will  reflect  the  combined\naccuracy   of   the   standard   and   the   dilution   system,\ntogether    with    the    accuracy    of    the    background\ndetermination;  all  must  be  taken  into  account  in  any\nstatement of analytical uncertainty.\n7. 3  Changing the Range of Performance of a Moisture\nStandard  \u2014  If  a  moisture  standard  is  based  on  some\ndevice   which   is   believed   to   deliver   moisture   at   a\nconstant rate, such as a permeation or effusion tube, the\nconcentration  range  delivered  by  the  moisture  standard\nmay  be  changed  by  delivering  a  substantially  different\nflow  of  carrier  gas.  This  usually  requires  changing  a\nmass flow controller or other flow control device inside\nthe  standard  for  a  flow  controller  of  a  different  range.\nThis  may  be  done  provided  the  new  flow  controller's\nperformance  is  verified  by  comparison  with  a  reliable\nflow standard.\nThe definition of dilution factor is revised to\nx=\nflow generated by original flow controller\nflow generated by new flow controller\n(3)"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"The  background,  B,  is  determined  by  removing  the\npermeation   or   effusion   tube   from   the   system   and\ncapping off its point of connection, or by preventing the\nsource  from  delivering  moisture  by  some  other  means.\nThe  same  equation  for  c  applies  as  does  the  statement\nregarding analytical uncertainty.\n7. 4  Validation  at  Intermediate  Concentrations  \u2014  It\nmay  be  desirable  to  validate  a  moisture  standard  at  a\nconcentration  below  the  detection  limit  of  the  primary\nhygrometer, if that standard is to be used for very low-\nlevel generation. For example, if a standard based on a\npermeation   device   is   intended   to   generate   levels\nbetween 0.5 and 5 ppb at flows of 1 to 10 slm, it could\nbe  validated  in  the  0.5  to  5  ppm  range  using  a  frost-\npoint  hygrometer  by  replacing  the  flow  controller  with\none operating between 1 and 10 sccm\n1"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,". However, such\na  flow  controller  may  not  be  readily  available  and  is\ndifficult to calibrate in any case.

This procedure is\nacceptable, provided that\n\u2022 the  secondary  hygrometer  has  been  validated  with\na  primary  hygrometer  at  least  at  one  point  in  the\nrange  to  be  used  for  validation  of  the  moisture\nstandard,\n\u2022 the   moisture   concentrations   generated   by   the\nstandard   and   that   observed   by   the   secondary\nhygrometer    agree    throughout    the    range    of\nvalidation of the standard.\nThis  approach  could  lead  to  errors  if  the  hygrometer\nand   the   standard   each   exhibited   a   deviation   from\npredicted performance, but these deviations would have\nto be the same and cancel, which is extremely unlikely.\nIn   the   case   of   operation   in   this   mode,   it   will   be\nnecessary  to  know  the  background  level  of  the  system\nand  use  this  as  an  input  to  the  calculation  of  generated\nmoisture   levels.

For\nexample,  the  minimum  shelf  life  of  a  reactive  gas  in  a\nnon-reactive gas matrix would be 24 months. The shelf\nlife  of  a  mixture  should  apply  both  to  the  impurity\nspecifications and to the assay of the mixture.\n5. 4.1     Special    attention    should    be    pai d    to    the\npreparation of the package for mixtures containing less\nthan   1,000   ppm   of   a   component.   At   such   levels,\nadsorption   effects   may   reduce   the   shelf   life   and\nminimization of the package internal surface roughness\nand/or passivation of the surface may be required.\n5. 5  Residual Level \u2014 The impact  of the depletion of a\ncontainer  on  impurity  levels  is  still  a  matter  of  debate\namong  gas  suppliers.  In  general,  the  impurity  levels  of\nthe  first  gas  fraction  from  a  container  will  differ  from\nthe  last  gas  fraction.  In  particular  moisture  levels  tend\nto  rise  at  lower  gas  pressures  as  a  result  of  the  relative\nincrease  in  importance  of  the  internal  container  wall\nand  its  adsorbed  moisture.  In  addition,  in  liquefied\ngases the co-existence of both a gas phase and a liquid\nphase  can  have  a  measurable  effect  on  the  distribution\nof  impurities  over  the  gas  fractions.  It  is  argued  that  at\nthe  point  of  liquid-dry  some  impurities,  which  prefer\nsolution in the liquid phase over the gas phase, may see\na  dramatic  rise.  It  is  therefore  recommended  to  always\nleave  an  amount  of  product  in  the  container  and  to\navoid  a  situation  of  \u201cliquid  dry\u201d  (i.e.,  when  all  of  the\nliquid phase of a liquefied gas has been used).\nNOTICE:      SEMI      makes      no      warranties      or\nrepresentations  as  to  the  suitability  of  the  specification\nset  forth  herein  for  any  particular  application.

The\ntwo  leveling  bottles  should  be  filled  half  full  of  testing\nsolution   and   the   buret   and   aspirator   bottle,   which\ncontains the copper coils, should be completely filled.\n9. 5.4  Operating Procedure\n9. 5.4.1    Before  analyzing  the  sample,  perform  a  series\nof  analyses  using  a  source  of  oxygen  of  which  the\npurity  has  been  previously  determined.  This  procedure\nis   necessary   to   age   the   test   solution   properly   and\neliminate any air bubbles which may become trapped in\nthe  apparatus.  Only  after  three  consecutive  analyses\nhave been run, indicating the known purity, should you\nproceed with testing. (See Note 8)\nNOTE  8:    This  procedure  will  be  required  only  immediately\nafter changing the test solution or contaminating the apparatus\nwith air.\n9. 5.4.2    Attach  rubber  tubing  from  the  regulator  of  the\ncylinder  being  tested  to  the  stopcock  of  the  burette.\nRotate  the  stopcock  so  as  to  draw  the  sample  into  the\ngas  measuring  burette.

If the gas sample in the burette is below the\nzero  mark  raise  the  leveling  bottle  #1  so  that  the\n\xecwater\xee  level  in  the  burette  is  exactly  zero  (see  Figure\n2a).\n9. 5.4.3    Rotate  the  stopcock  to  connect  the  aspirator\nbottle  #3  containing  the  copper  coils,  and  transfer  the\noxygen into this aspirator bottle by raising the leveling\nbottle #1 (see Figure 2b). Invert bottle #3 containing the"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"SEMI C54-1103 \xa9 SEMI 2003 5\ncopper coils so that both the inlet stopper and the sided\noutlet  are  in  a  downward  position  and  shake  gently  for\n1  to  2  minutes.  Stand  test  bottle  #3  on  its  base  and\nlower the leveling bottle so as to withdraw any residual\ngases  into  the  gas  measuring  burette  (see  Figure  2c).\nTransfer  at  least  25  to  30  mL  of  test  solution  from  the\nleft-hand leveling bottle #2 into the right-hand leveling\nbottle #l, through the copper coil bottle #3, and the gas\nburette  while,  at  the  same  time,  gently  rocking  and\ntapping  the  center  bottle  (see  Figure  2d).  This  will\nmove  any  bubbles  that  might  cling  to  the  copper  coil\ninto the gas measuring burette.\n9. 5.4.4    Turn  the  stopcock  off  and  raise  the  leveling\nbottle #l so that its liquid level is the same as the liquid\nlevel  inside  the  upper  portion  of  the  gas  burette  (see\nFigure  2e).  When  the  levels  of  the  leveling  bottle  and\nthe   gas   burette   are   the   same,   read   the   gas   purity\nmarkings on the burette at the liquid level at this point.\n9. 5.5  Maintenance\n9. 5.5.1    Copper  coils  should  be  added  to  the  test  bottle\nas required to keep the bottles completely full. The gas\nburette  should  be  kept  clean  with  a  strong  detergent\nsolution to eliminate drops of liquid that might hang up\nin  the  gas  space  and  give  incorrect  purity  readings.  No\nreadings  should  be  taken  when  the  space  above  the\nliquid  level  of  the  gas  burette  has  any  liquid  drops\nhanging  in  it,  as  this  will  give  an  erroneous  purity\nreading.\n9. 5.5.2  The solution must be replaced occasionally as it\nbecomes  exhausted.
