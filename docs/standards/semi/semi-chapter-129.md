BARCODE LABEL POSITIONS FOR 300 MM TAPE FRAMES
NOTE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of
SEMI  G74  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot  procedures
on March 17, 1999.
A-1  Barcode Label Positions
A-1.1  The recommended position for the barcode label
is position (A in Figure A1-1).
A-1.2    However,  it  is  acceptable  if  the  barcode  labels
are within the shaded area (see B in Figure A1-1).
A-2  Reasons to recommend position (A)
A-2.1    It  is  easier  to  detect  whether  there  are  any
barcode labels or not, without pulling out the frames.
A-2.2    It  is  convenient  to  have  the  labels  on  the
opposite side of the notches, as the frames are normally
pulled out from the notch side.

manufacturers,   and   their   customers   in   evaluating
leadframe tapes.
2. 2  Units
2. 2.1  This standard test method uses  SI (metric) units.
3  Referenced Documents
3. 1    Referenced   documents   are   list ed   in   each   test
method.
4  Terminology
4. 1   breakdown  strength  —  Under   the  specified  test
conditions,  the  quotient  of  the  minimum  r.m.s.  voltage
at the breakdown of the test piece (breakdown voltage)
divided  by  the  distance  between  the  two  electrodes
(thickness of test piece).
4. 2   dielectric  constant  —  The  amo unt  of  electrostatic
energy stored in a unit volume of a substance in a unit
electric  field.  It  is  called  dielectric  constant  (εr)  and
expressed  as  the  quotient  of  electrostatic  capacity  of  a
parallel   condenser   employing   the   test   piece   as   the
dielectric  (C
x
)  divided  by  that  of  the  same  condenser
when  air  (under  the  standard  condition,  the  dielectric
constant of air can be taken for that of vacuum) is used
as   the   dielectric   (C
o
),   measured   under   a   specified
frequency.
i.e.,ε=C
x
/C
o
4. 3     dielectric    dissipation    factor    —     Dielectric
dissipation  factor  is  the  tangent  of  the  complementary
angle  of  dielectric  phase  angle  (tand).  The  dielectric
phase  angle  is  the  phase  difference  angle  (q)  between
sine-wave  voltage  applied  to  the  test  piece  and  the
current  component  having  the  same  frequency  as  the
applied voltage caused by the voltage application.
4. 4    HAST   —   Highly   accelerated   s tress   test:   For
example, 121° C/2 atm/100% RH.
4. 5  leadframe tape  —  An  adhesiv e  coated  tape.  After
removing  protective  film,  laminated  to  the  inner  leads,
which   stops   lead   shift   and/or   lead   lift   during   the
assembly process.
4. 6    protective   film   —A   plastic   film    to   cover   the
adhesive  on  leadframe  tapes.  This  film  prevents  the
adhesive  from  becoming  contaminated  and  is  removed
from  the  leadframe  tape  just  prior  to  taping  the  lead-
frame.
4. 7   strain  —  The  ratio  of  elongatio n  of  the  sample
length to the original length at the applied stress level.
4. 8  stress — The applied force per  unit cross-sectional
area of the sample.
4. 9   surface  resistivity  —  The  quot ient  of  the  voltage
gradient  parallel  to  the  current  along  the  surface  of  the
test  piece  divided  by  the  current  per  unit  width  of  the
surface.

SEMI G75-0698 © SEMI 19982
4. 10   tensile  break  strength  —  The  t ensile  force  per
unit of original cross section of the sample at the point
of breakage.
4. 11  tensile modulus — The ratio o f stress to strain of
the sample below the yield point, in the elastic region of
the stress/strain curve.
NOTE: Plastic materials may not have a true elastic region in
the  stress/strain  curve  or  force/elongation  curve.  A  tangent  is
drawn   to   the   maximum   slope   of   the   curve   in   order   to
determine the modulus.
4. 12   thermal  decomposition  temper ature  (base  film
and     adhesive)     —     The     thermal     decomposition
temperature  is  determined  at  5%  of  the  weight  loss
when   the   tape   is   set   to   the   thermal   ramp   at   10°
C/minute.
4. 13   volume  resistivity  —  The  quot ient  of  the  voltage
gradient  parallel  to  the  current  within  the  test  piece
divided by the current density.
5  Significance
5. 1  Ionic Impurities
5. 1.1   Ionic  contamination  can  adver sely  affect  the
reliability of semiconductor devices by causing leakage
currents and aluminum corrosion.
5. 2  Adhesive Strength
5. 2.1   Low  adhesive  strength  may  re sult  in  inner  leads
movement   of   leadframe   during   the   assembly   and
packaging  process  which  may  result  in  low  yield  or
poor device reliability.
5. 3  Peel  Strength  of  Protective  Fil m  from  Leadframe
Tape
5. 3.1   If  the  peeling  strength  of  prote ctive  film  from
leadframe  tape  varies  in  peeling  strength,  the  taping
machines will not operate consistently.
5. 4  Water Absorption
5. 4.1    If   the   leadframe   tapes   absorb   a n   excessive
amount  of  water  in  storage,  before  or  after  packaging,
then  reliability  of  devices  made  by  these  leadframes
may  be  affected.  Current  leakage  and  corrosion  of
device metallization may occur.
5. 5  Weight Loss
5. 5.1     Weight    loss    may    indicate    that     devices
manufactured   with   the   leadframe   tape   may   have
reliability problems due to the tape outgassing.
5. 6  Shrinkage Factor
5. 6.1   Excessive  shrinkage  at  therma l  processing  may
cause   the   lead   shift   and   wire   bond   problems   for
automatic bonders.
5. 7  Thermal Decomposition Temp erature
5. 7.1   The  devices  manufactured  wit h  leadframe  tape
that  decomposes  at  too  low  a  temperature  may  have
lower reliability.
5. 8  Coefficient of   Thermal   Expans ion   and   Glass
Transition Temperature
5. 8.1   Excessive  expansion  of  the  lea dframe  tape  may
cause lead shift and/or lead lift and result in dislocated
bonds from automatic bonders.
5. 9  Tensile Strength, Elongation, a nd Tensile Modulus
5. 9.1   If  the  tensile  strength,  elongati on,  and  tensile
modulus  varies,  the  taping  machines  will  not  operate
consistently.
5. 10  Volume and Surface Resistivity
5. 10.1    Low   volume   and/or   surface   re sistivity   is
indicative    of    potential    leakage    currents    between
leadframe  inner  leads  which  can  affect  the  function  of
the device.
5. 11  Dielectric Constant and Dissip ation Factor
5. 11.1    High   dielectric   constant   mater ials   used   in
semiconductor    packages    may    cause    transmission
delays.  High  dielectric  loss  causes  energy  loss,  which
leads    to    exothermic    problems    in    semiconductor
packages.
5. 12  Breakdown Strength
5. 12.1   Very  low  breakdown  strength   may  cause  de-
vices to fail in use.
5. 13  Leakage Current
5. 13.1    A   high   leakage   current   betwee n   leadframe
inner  leads,  which  may  be  exacerbated  due  to  high
moisture test conditions and impurities in the tape, may
result in poor device reliability.

sample clamping chucks, and a chart recorder.
2. 2  Micrometer with 0.001 mm ac curacy.
2. 3  Calipers with 0.02 mm accurac y.
3  Test Condition
3. 1   Tensile  test  measurements  sha ll  be  carried  out  at
the following ambient conditions:
Temperature — 23 ± 5°C
Humidity — 50 ± 5% RH
4  Sampling
4. 1   The  sampling  is  one  sample  pe r  one  lot.  The
vendor   has   to   report   the   definition   of   lot,   if   the
customer requires it.
4. 2  The sample width shall be 15.0  ± 0.2 mm, and the
length must be 100 mm minimum.
5  Equipment Setup and Cal ibration
5. 1     Refer    to    the    tensile    tester    manu facturer’s
equipment manual for setup and calibration.
5. 2  The pulling rate shall be set to  5 ± 0.5 mm/minute.
5. 3  The load shall be recorded in k ilograms.
6  Procedure
6. 1   Measure  the  thickness  (T)  of  th e  sample  with  the
micrometer and the width (W) with calipers (mm).
6. 2   Clamp  the  tape  in  the  chucks  s o  that  the  distance
(L
0
) between the chucks is 50 ± 5 mm.
NOTE:    Some    equipment    may    measure    this    length
automatically  or  plot  Stress  versus  Strain,  (L/L
0
),  directly,
where L is the elongation.
6. 3   Start  the  pulling  and  record  un til  the  sample
breaks.
6. 4  Repeat the testing procedures  for all the samples.
7  Results
7. 1   Read  the  Break  Force  A  (kg)  a nd  Elongation  L

reading a minimum of 0.001 mm integrals.
(2) Material —  Use  the  TCP  polyimide  adhesive
tape as received from the supplier.
(3) Measurement  —  Measure  the  TD  direction
length in 3 points at least 1m apart in the MD
direction, and calculate the average.
8. 5 Mechanical Efficiency Tests
8. 5.1 Copper Foil Adhesive Strength
(1) Equipment
(a)     A     pull     tester     with     an     appropriate
measurement  range,  having  a  tolerance  of  ±
5%  of  the  indicated  value,  and  capable  of
maintaining   a   cross-head   speed   of   10−50
mm/min.
(b)  A  pull  tester  with  a  sample  retention  heating
device   or   sample   chamber   for   retaining
surface temperature for measuring conditions.
(2) Material
(a) Normal  Use a sample with copper etching
and  conductor  width  of  50  ±  10  μm  and
conductor  length  of  more  than  30  mm.  The
measurement    direction    and    number    of
samples  should  be  previously  determined  by
the   user   and   supplier.   Unless   otherwise
specified,  use  2  samples  and  measure  in  the
MD direction.
(b) Heated  Use the same as (a), except with a
conductor width of 2 ± 0.5 mm.
(3) Measurement
(a) Normal    After   measuring   the   sample
conductor  width,  fix  the  sample  in  the  pull
tester. In order to keep peeling angle at 90°,
affix  a  reinforcement  panel  with  double-
sided  adhesive  tape.  Pull  and  peel  off  more
than  20  mm  of  copper  foil  at  a  speed  of  10
mm/min
-1
and an angle of 90 ± 5°. Measure
the load during this interval.
(b) Heated  Fix the sample in retention heating
device   of   the   pull   tester   and   raise   the
temperature,    or,    fix    the    sample    in    a
previously  retention  heating  device  in  the
pull tester. It is also feasible to use a sample
chamber  which  can  heat  the  whole  sample.
Measure   the   sample   surface   temperature
with   a   contact   surface   thermometer,   and
when   a   temperature   of   150   ± 5°C   is
confirmed,  quickly  pull  and  peel  off  more
than  20  mm  of  copper  foil  at  a  speed  of  10
mm/min
-1
and an angle of 90 ± 5°. Measure
the load during this interval.
(c) Soaked  in  Solvent   After  soaking  the
sample  in  a  specified  solvent  at  23  ± 5°C
for 5 minutes, remove the sample and rinse
and  dry  off  solvent  thoroughly.  Place  in
normal  conditions,  as  described  in  Section
8. 1.1,  for  24  ±  4  hours  and  perform  the
same    test    as    above    "normal"    (3)(a).
However,  if  the  solvent  is  inorganic,  wash
sample  well  with  water  after  taking  it  out
of  the  solvent  and  dry  at  80  ± 5°C  for  30
minutes.  Then  place  in  normal  conditions,
as  described  in  Section  8.1.1,  for  24  ±  4
hours  and  perform  the  same  test  as  above
"normal"  (3)(a).  The  type  and  condition  of
the  solvent  used  shall  be  agreed  between
the user and supplier.
(4) Calculation
(a) Compile the measurements, leaving out the
overshoot  at  the  beginning  and  end,  and
calculate  the  average  of  samples  with  a
stable  section  of  10  mm.  The  method  of
calculating     the     average     should     be
predetermined  by  the  user  and  supplier.
Unless  otherwise  speci-fied,  place  a  ruler
over the chart and determine visually.
(b)  Calculate  the  load  on  pulling  and  peeling
off of each sample, excluding the samples
conductor  width,  and  the  average  will  be
the copper foil adhesive strength.
8. 5.2 Cover Film Release Strength
(1) Equipment   Use  the  same  equipment  as  in
Section 8.5.1 (1).
(2) Material  Use a 250 mm section cut from the
TCP  polyimide  adhesive  tape  as  received  from
the vendor.


SEMI G76-0299 © SEMI 1999 6
(3) Measurement   After  measuring  the  sample
cover  film  width,  fix  the  sample  in  the  pull
tester. In order to keep the sample at 90°, affix
a    reinforcement    panel    with    double-sided
adhesive  tape.  Pull  and  peel  off  more  than  50
mm  of  cover  film  at  a  speed  of  50  mm/min
-1

and  an  angle  of  90  ± 5°.  Measure  the  load
during this interval.
(4) Calculation  Use the same method as Section
8. 5.1, (4).
8. 6 Electrical Efficiency Test
8. 6.1 Volume Resistivity
(1) Equipment   Use  high  insulation-resistance
meter   which   conforms   to   JIS   C-1303,   or
similar    resistance    measuring    device    (see
Figure 2).
(2) Material -   Prepare   a   section   of   TCP
polyimide    adhesive    tape    with    adhesive
material  width  of  more  than  50  mm,  laminate
with  copper  foil  and  cure  according  to  the
method  described  in  Section  8.2.  In  addition,
etch  the  main  electrode  and  guard  electrode
into  the  shapes  found  in  Figure  3.  For  the
counter   electrode,   melt   on   a   conductive
material   to   the   opposing   polyimide   film
surface, or form it out of conductive paste. Dry
these  at  80  ± 5°C  for  30  minutes.  Cut  these
into 50 mm squares for the material.
(3) Measurement   Use  the  following  steps  to
measure under normal conditions: Measure the
thickness  of  the  samples  in  units  of  0.1  μm,
and  measure  the  inner  diameter  of  the  gap  in
the  circular  upper  electrode  in  units  of  0.05
mm.  Apply  direct  voltage  of  500V  ±  5V,  and
measure the resistance value after 1 minute.
