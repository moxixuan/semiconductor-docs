Particle sampling is\nusually  performed  using  wall  tap  sample  ports.    Wall\ntap  sample  ports  are  oriented  90\u221e  to  the  process  line\nflow as shown in Figure R1-1.  Non-isokinetic flow into\nthe  sample  tube  results  from  the  90\u221e  change  in  flow\ndirection.    Additional  deviation  from  isokinesis  can\nresult  from  stream  tube  contraction  or  expansion  when\nthe  velocities  U  and  v  are  not  equal.    The  effects  of\nnon-isokinetic   flow   on   the   measurement   should   be\nchecked.
