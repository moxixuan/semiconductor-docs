SEMI  makes  no  warranties  or  representations  as  to  the
suitability  of  the  terms  and  definitions  set  forth  herein
for any particular application. The determination of the
suitability  of  the  terms  and  definitions  is  solely  the
responsibility of the user.
array  rotation  —  the  total  array  set  rotated  relative  to
substrate edges.
cavity   —   in   pellicle   technology,   an   unfilled   space
between  the  photomask  and  the  optically  transparent
film within the mounted pellicle frame area.
coherence,     spatial     —     the     correlation     of     the
electromagnetic fields at different points in space.  Can
be achieved with a non-monochromatic source.
coherence,      temporal      —      the      correlation      of
electromagnetic fields at different points in time but the
same     point     in     space     (related     to     the     non-
monochromaticity of the source).
composite drawing — a large-scale drawing comprising
all   geometric   forms   required   for   a   single   device,
arranged  in  proper  relative  positions.  It  is  used  as  a
guide for manual cutting by Rubylith, or for a digitizing
guide  for  Computer  Aided  Design  (see  CAD).  The  set
of colored overlay films made as work progresses to the
reticle   stage,   can   also   be   considered   a   composite,
suitable   for   checking   design   errors.   (SYN:   Master
Drawing, Engineering Drawing, Design Drawing.)
contact mask — in semiconductor fabrication, after the
major  diffusions,  gates,  and  other  active  areas  have
been  deposited,  a  glass  insulating  layer  is  placed  over
the whole die. Small holes are etched through this glass
at  points  where  the  interconnecting  metal  conducts
must  ‘contact’  the  active  areas.  The  mask  that  defines
these  holes  is  characterized  by  many  small  squares
(~0.2–0.4 mil) scattered throughout the die area.
contact printing — a process of reproducing an original
by  placing  a  photomask  so  that  the  coated  side  is  in
contact with the photoresist (or emulsion) surface of the
area to be printed and then exposing the photoresist (or
emulsion).
cure,    photoresist    —    the    process    of    eliminating
undesirable    properties    of    photoresists,    such    as
tackiness,   softness,   the   tendency   to   flow,   lack   of
adhesion, etc.
dark area — an opaque area.
defect, gross photomask — a photomask defect that can
be    easily    seen    with    the    naked    eye    or    under
magnification  no  greater  than  10×.    Examples:  large
scratches,  cracks  in  the  glass  substrate,  drying  marks,
etc.
defect,  photomask  —  any  flaw  or  imperfection  in  the
opaque  coating  or  functional  pattern  of  a  photomask
that will reproduce itself in a photoresist film to such a
degree that it is pernicious to the proper functioning of
the microelectronic device being fabricated.
degradation  —  reductions  in  image  quality  (measured
as  resolution,  edge  acuity,  dimensional  shifts,  defect
density,   etc.)   experienced   in   each   generation   of
reproduction,  as  compared  to  the  original  or  preceding
generation.  Generally,  degradation  increases  with  each
generation, in a predictable manner.
diffraction  pattern,  spatial  —  intensity  variations  of
light  in  the  viewing  plane  caused  by  interference  of
waves undergoing diffraction.
element  —  a  member  of  the  set  that  makes  up  the
photomask  array;  used  either  as  a  functional  layer
member for the fabrication of a single, integrated circuit
or for test purposes. (Replaces chip, die, bar.)
emulsion — a suspension of a salt of silver in gelatin or
collodion   that   is   coated   onto   a   photoplate   and   is
exposed and developed to produce a photomask.
energy, minimum exposure — the energy corresponding
to   the   total   integrated   energy   of   actinic   radiation
necessary  to  just  completely  render  soluble  a  positive
photoresist  for  a  given  replacement  film  thickness  or
just  completely  render  insoluble  a  negative  photoresist
for a given single resist film thickness.
energy,  optimum  exposure  —  the  energy  per  square
centimeter  corresponding  to  the  total  integrated  energy
of  actinic  radiation  necessary  to  accurately  reproduce
photomask pattern dimensions in a photoresist of given
thickness after exposure and development.
etch resistance — the ability of a photomask coating or
protecting  material,  such  as  photoresist,  in  which  the
pattern is imaged or photoprinted.</p><p>SEMI P33-0998 © SEMI 19989
etch  time  —  the  time  required  for  the  removal  of  a
coating in an etching medium.
etchant  —  the  chemically  reactive  solution  used  for
removal of unwanted metallic coating from a substrate.
field  —  the  background  area  of  a  device  is  defined  as
the  area  not  being  acted  upon  during  the  fabrication
process. Thus, if a mask is to be used to produce metal
interconnects,  the  area  representing  non-metal  is  the
“field.”  The image polarity is named by the appearance
of  this  field;  thus,  clear  field,  dark  (opaque)  field.  This
definition  is  very  carefully  stated  because,  in  some
devices, their gross appearance is very deceiving in that
“field”  cannot  always  be  denoted  as  the  major  area.
Some  devices  may  have  diffusion  of  buried  layers,  for
instance, covering 80% of the area, the remaining 20%
being  the  field.  Some  knowledge  of  the  fabrication
process is essential when determining field, as many of
these ambiguous conditions exist where the field is less
than  50%  of  the  area.  (ANT:  active  area;  geometry;
trace: diffusion area.)
film adhesive — adhesive between frame and film.
film  thickness,  dirt  —  fingerprint;  mark  touched  by
something; stain by liquid.
film  thickness,  particle  —  the  particle  state  materials
that can be distinguished from the film itself on the film
surface or inside the film.
film  thickness,  pinhole  —  a  small  opening  completely
through a polymer film.
fixer  —  a  chemical  solution  which  makes  an  image
permanent.  In  the  case  of  silver  emulsion  processes,  it
dissolves   and   removes   the   unexposed/undeveloped
silver  halide  crystals  so  that  further  darkening  of  the
image cannot occur.
frame   adhesive   —   adhesive   between   frame   and
photomask.
functional  element  —  any  contiguous  fragment  of  a
device that is necessary to the electrical operation of the
finished   device.   Examples   include   diffused   areas,
traces,   gates,   contacts,   etc.;   excludes   scribe   lines,
alignment marks, labels, etc. (SYN: active geometry.)
gel slug — a piece of clear, dried gelatin that has been
trapped  in  a  silver/gelatin  emulsion  during  coating.  A
gel  slug    has  the  appearance,  under  a  microscope,  of  a
clear lens-like lump, generally 0.5 – 2 mils in size, and
about twice as long as wide.
isolation  layer  —  a  partitioning,  especially  of  bipolar
devices,  usually  by  diffusion,  to  electrically  insulate
functional  components  of  an  integrated  circuit  device.
Isolation   masks   are   usually   layer   1   or   2,   and
characterized by thin lines defining open boxes all over
the die area. (SYN: isolation mask.)
latent  image  —  the  invisible  image  formed  on  any
photosensitive material after exposure. It requires some
type of development to produce a useful, visible image.
layer   —   one   of   a   sequential   series   of   overlaying
photomasks that make up a device series.
mask set — the complete series of masks for all layers,
necessary to fabricate any given device.
master drawing — the original drawing from which the
artwork is made.
master mask — original photomask, at 1× (final) scale,
generated  with  a  photorepeater  from  which  submasters
are printed. (SYN: master.)
matrix  —  the  rectangular  arrangement  of  die  on  a
photomask. (SYN: array.)
mechanical strength — the physical condition a pellicle
must  meet  to  withstand  a  specified  force  from  a  blow-
off gun without suffering any damage to the film.
mouse bite — see mouse nip.
mouse  nip  —  in  semiconductor  imaging  technology,  a
semicircular intrusion.
objective  lens  —  in  a  microscope  system,  it  is  the  lens
closest  to  the  test  specimen  (object).    Usually  provides
the  greatest  amount  of  the  total  magnification  and  also
limits   system   resolution.   Most   commonly   several
objectives, in typical powers of 10×, 20×, and 40×, are
mounted  on  a  turret  for  rapid  magnification  changes.
See also ocular.
ocular  —  the  set  of  microscope  lenses  closest  to  the
observer’s  eye  that  produces  final  magnification  of
microscope.   It   usually   contains   graticules   or   filar-
measuring apparatus. See also objective lens.
opacity — a direct measure of the light-stopping power
of  a  semitransparent  medium,  as  glass  photographic
emulsion  or  a  thin  chrome  coating.  Represented  as  the
reciprocal  of  transmittance,  O  =  1/T.  The  common
logarithm  of  opacity  if  used  as  Optical  Density.  D  =
Log
10
O
.
pellicle — a thin, optically transparent film, typically of
nitrocellulose,  attached  to,  supported  by  a  frame,  and
attached to a photomask (or photomask reticle). NOTE:
Its  purpose  is  to  seal  out  contaminants  and  reduce
printed  defects  caused  by  contamination  in  the  image
plane of an optical exposure system.
photorepeater  —  a  combination  of  a  high-resolution
reduction    (usually    10×    or    5×)    camera    and    a
programmable  precision  stage.    The  image  from  the</p><p>SEMI P33-0998 © SEMI 199810
camera  is  projected  onto  a  photoplate,  attached  to  the
stage, and exposed in as many positions as required by
moving the stage between exposures.  The product of a
photorepeater   is   the   master   mask.   (SYN:   image
repeater; step-and-repeat camera.)
printing  —  the  transfer  of  an  image  from  one  surface
(substrate) onto another at 1× scale.  Usually “printing”
refers   to   the   contact   method,   but   it   also   can   be
accomplished  using  a  1-to-1  projection  optical  system.
(SYN: contact printing.)
printing,  contact  —  photoprinting  photomask  patterns
by  exposure  of  a  photosensitive  material  coated  on  a
supporting  substrate  to  radiation  passing  through  the
photomask,  which  is  in  contact  with  the  photosensitive
material.
printing, off-contact — see printing, proximity.
printing, projection — a method of optically projecting
an    image    onto    a    photosensitive    material,    thus
eliminating   the   need   for   photomask/photosensitive-
coating contact.
printing,    proximity    —    photoprinting    photomask
patterns  by  exposure  of  photosensitive  material  coated
on  a  supporting  substrate  to  radiation  passing  through
the  photomask  which  is  in  the  proximity  of,  but  not  in
contact with, the photosensitive material being exposed.
reduction  camera  —  a  mechanism  used  to  optically
reduce    the    size    of    images    and    record    them
photographically.  In two-step reduction, a copy camera
is used for the range of 100× to 1000× reduced to 10×;
the photorepeater reduces from 5× or 10× to 1×.  Both
are reduction cameras.  See also photorepeater.
registration  mark  —  a  mark  used  to  control  placement
of one layer relative to another.
repetitive  defect  —  a  defect  (spot,  pinhole,  protrusion,
or   intrusion)   introduced   on   the   reticle   so   that   in
generating a master, it reproduces on every die.
reversal  process  —  a  photographic  emulsion  process
that  produces  an  image  which  is  the  same  as  the  input
image (i.e., clear areas remain clear, and opaque remain
opaque).  It  is  named  ‘reversal’  because  it  yields  the
‘reverse’     of     the     standard     ‘negative’     process.
Accomplished   by   developing   the   negative   image,
destroying    this    image    by    bleaching,    and    then
subsequently  developing  all  the  original  silver  halide
that  represents  the  positive  image.  (SYN:  positive-
acting,  process,  positive  process.  ANT:  negative  acting
process, normal process.)
rotation,  of  array  —  whole  array  is  properly  arranged
(die  relative  to  die),  but  placed  on  a  blank  which  is
rotationally  mis-aligned.  May  occur  during  stepping  or
contact printing.
rotation, of die — on a master, misplacement of die by
an  angular  displacement  around  the  Z-axis.  Usually
caused    by    mispositioning    of    the    reticle    in    a
photorepeater  so  that  it  does  not  lie  parallel  to  X-  and
Y-axis of stage travel.
run-in   —   a   die   placement   error,   where   the   die
increment  is  less  than  the  design  dimension.  This  can
occur    during    stepping,    due    to    nonlinearity    of
miscalibration  of  the  photorepeater  stage  scan  scale,  or
during contact printing due to plate warpage.
shelf  life  —  the  period  of  time,  at  specified  conditions
of   storage,   in   which   the   physical   and   chemical
properties  that  affect  a  material’s  performance  remain
acceptable.
smear  —  a  large  area  of  partially  removed  coating  or
deposited foreign material.
space — area between image geometries; field between
close-lying  images.  The  space  is  often  specified  as  the
critical  dimension.  (SYN:  field.  ANT:  digitized  area;
geometry.)
spinner — a device for holding a substrate and spinning
it  at  a  controlled  rate  of  speed  (usually  1000  to  6000
RPM),  for  applying    extremely  thin  coating,  as  with
photoresist.
submaster  —  a  photomask  printed  in  limited  quantities
from  masters,  and  from  which  the  working  plates  are
printed. Used to reduce wear and tear on masters.
test  device  —  a  simplified,  functional  device  (of  the
same  process  type  as  the  majority  die),  inserted  in
several  positions  in  any  array,  used  for  process  control
and monitoring during wafer fabrication.
torn image — image broken by movement of the image
medium. Most often seen on emulsion images.
variable aperture  —  an  aperture  whose  open  area  may
be increased or decreased by movement of the elements
forming the aperture.
visual  defects  —  defects  that  can  be  identified  by  a
skilled   observer   (with   or   without   the   aid   of   a
microscope)  without  having  to  measure  or  compare
(e.g., pinholes, slugs, spots, protrusions, etc.).
working   plate   —   mask   used   selectively   to   expose
photoresist   on   a   wafer   for   IC   fabrication.   Usually
printed from submasters or masters, thus preserving the
master from excessive handling damage.

flatness  quality  area  as  defined  in  Figure  4a  or  Figure
4b.  Sides are not required to have equivalent flatness.
NOTE   2:   Flatness   of   0.5   μm   is   very   desirable   for
semiconductor production, and equipment suppliers may want
to consider this in their designs.
9  Visual Criteria
9. 1   A  visual  quality  area,  which  m ay  or  may  not
correspond   with   the   flatness   quality   area,   shall   be
agreed upon between the user and supplier.
9. 2   Each  substrate  shall  not  have  m ore  defects  than
listed  in  Table  4.  This  table  includes  limits  for  the
following types of defects:
9. 2.1  Internal defects in the visual q uality area,
9. 2.2  Critical side surface defects in  the visual quality
area,
9. 2.3   Non-critical  side  surface  defec ts  in  the  visual
quality area, and
9. 2.4  Defects outside the visual qual ity area.
9. 3  Fused silica substrates shall be  identified with one
corner chamfer as shown in Figure 5. Dimensions of the
chamfer  shall  be  as  specified  in  Figure  6.  The  corner
chamfer  is  made  only  on  the  non-critical  side  of  the
substrate.
NOTE  3:  This  configuration  of  corner  chamfers  is  different
than  the  configuration  used  for  smaller  ULTE  class  material
substrates as defined in SEMI P1.
10  Sampling
10. 1   Unless  otherwise  specified,  ap propriate  sample
sizes shall be selected from each lot in accordance with
ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4.  Each  quality  characteristic  shall  be
assigned    an    acceptable    quality    level    (AQL)    in
accordance   with   ANSI/ASQC   Z1.4   definitions   for
critical, major, and minor classifications. If desired, and
so  specified  in  the  contract  or  order,  each  of  these
classifications may alternatively be assigned cumulative
AQL  values.  Inspection  levels  shall  be  agreed  upon
between user and supplier.
11  Test Methods

handled with gloves approved for cleanroom use.
13  Orientation
13. 1   For  fused  silica  substrates  with   a  single  corner
chamfer  (see  Section  9.3),  it  is  recommended  that  all
orientation  be  performed  referencing  the  corner  of  the
non-critical    side    diagonally    opposite    the    corner
chamfer.      The   corner   for   orientation   signifies   two
orientation  edges  for  positioning  of  the  substrate.    One
edge  shall  be  used  for  rotation  baseline  by  two  points.
The  other  edge  shall  be  used  for  positioning  by  one
point. See Figure 8 for more information.
14  Certification
14. 1   Upon  request  of  the  purchaser   in  the  contract  or
order,  a  manufacturer’s  or  supplier’s  certification  that
the material was manufactured and tested in accordance
with this specification, together with a report of the test
results, shall be furnished at the time of shipment.

4  Some Metrology Issues
4. 1  Measuring   Linewidth   —   Any   measurement   of
length  or  position  contains  an  unknown  error  whose
influence on subsequent application of the measurement
data  is  best  described  by  the  measurement  uncertainty
<!-- -->[reference  Section  3.2]<!-- -->.  The  problem  of  measuring
feature sizes on photomasks or integrated circuit wafers
(e.g., linewidth) is complicated by the fact that a feature
is   a   3-dimensional   object   whose   exact   shape   is
generally not known. The metrology problem is further
complicated when the object is microscopic and only its
magnified image can be measured.
4. 2    Feature  measurement  data  are  usually  reduced  to
one  or  a  few  parameters  because  the  additional  data
needed to describe the complex actual feature shape are
seldom   available   and   may   be   immaterial   to   the
subsequent application of the measurement data.
4. 3  The first rule of metrology is to define exactly what
is  to  be  measured.  The  approach  used  here,  in  light  of
the   previous   paragraphs,   is   to   construct   a   simple
idealized geometric shape, or feature model (Figure 1),
which  approximates  a  real  object  of  complex  shape.
This  model,  whose  size  and  center  position  are  well
defined, is substituted for the real feature in application
of  the  measurement  data.  A  model  can  be  refined  to
better  approximate  the  actual  feature  shape  by  adding
degrees   of   freedom,   requiring   more   parameters   to
describe the measurement. For example, a line might be
represented  by  a  rectangular  cross  section  (with  width
and height) or better represented by a trapezoidal cross
section  (with  base  width,  height,  and  two  wall  angles).
The differences between the model and the actual shape
of  the  feature  contribute  to  the  overall  measurement
uncertainty of the size or position of that feature.</p><p>1 American National Standards Institute, Headquarters: 1819 L

The Feature Model Approximates the Size and
Shape of the Feature</p><ol start="4"><li>3.1    The  feature  model  may  be  further  abstracted  to
suit   the   purpose   of   the   measurement   by   defining
bounding  boxes  to  represent  the  inner  and  outer  limits
on the space occupied by the feature. In the nonexistent
case  of  an  ideal  feature,  the  feature,  the  feature  model,
and the bounding boxes would all coincide.</li><li>4    The  aim  of  the  approach  embodied  here  is  to
facilitate   interpretation   of   metrology   results   for   a
feature  (and  the  feature’s  subsequent  performance  —
see section A1) in the most realistic terms, and in light
of any possible additional knowledge about that feature.</li><li>5    There  are  many  possible  reasons  for  measuring  a
feature’s size or placement. Consequently the following
definitions  may  include  options  or  alternatives,  to  be
selected  by  the  user  to  best  fit  the  purpose  of  the
measurement.
5  Definitions</li><li>1  Defined terms appearing in the definitions of other
terms  are  italicized.  Where  more  than  one  definition  is
given  for  a  term,  the  one  most  appropriate  to  the
application  is  to  be  chosen.  Some  of  these  definitions
describe  certain  usage  options  as  “the  default.”  That
option is assumed to apply unless otherwise specified.</li><li>1.1  bounding box — a user-specified geometric shape
with a planar face lying in the reference plane and with
user-specified   orientation   in   the   reference   plane,
intended  to  represent  limits  or  bounds  on  the  position
and  size  of  the  feature.  See  Figure  2  for  an  example.

Two Possible Bounding Box Choices for a Line
Feature
NOTE   1:      The   term   “bounding   box”   is   used   here   for
convenience,   but   the   word   “box”   may   not   always   be
considered   appropriate.   Terms   like   “bounding   figure”   or
“bounding   surface”   may   be   used   instead,   if   desired.   A
bounding box may coincide with a feature model.
5. 1.1.1  outer  bounding  box — smallest  bounding  box
encompassing the feature.
5. 1.1.2  best  fit  bounding  box  —  bounding  box  best
fitting the feature, with user-defined criteria of best fit.
5. 1.2  calibration  —  set  of  operations  that  establish,
under  specified  conditions,  the  relationship  between
values    of    quantities    indicated    by    a    measuring
instrument  or  measuring  system,  or  values  represented
by  a  material  measure  or  reference  material,  and  the
corresponding  values  realized  by  standards  <!-- -->[reference
Section 6.1]<!-- -->.
5. 1.3  centerline — (a)  The  locus  of  the  centroids of
successive  line  segments,  in  the  limit  as  the  segment
length  vanishes.  (b)  a  line  or  surface  midway  between
opposing feature edges.
5. 1.4  centroid — The  geometrical  center  of  an  object.
The  coordinates  of  the  centroid  of  an  object  are  C</p><h1>u</h1><p>∫∫∫u dV
/ ∫∫∫dV, where the integral is over the volume V
of the object and u can be x, y, or z.
5. 1.4.1  centroid measurement uncertainty — parameter
that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could
reasonably  be  attributed  to  the  position  of  the  centroid
or  the  placement of  an  object  in  the  reference  plane
coordinate system (see measurement uncertainty).
NOTE 2:  The edges of the feature form part of the boundary
of the integral defining the centroid; edge position uncertainty
leads  to  integral  boundary  uncertainty  and  thus  to  centroid
uncertainty.   The   centroid   measurement   uncertainty   of   a
feature described  by  inner and outer  linewidth  bounding</p><p>SEMI P35-0704 © SEMI 2000, 2004 3

position  of  the  mean  linewidth  bounding  box  and  of  the
positions   of   the   line’s   edges   between   these   linewidth
bounding  boxes,  taking  into  account  possible  opposite  edge
correlations.    (These    correlations    can    result    in    feature
placement or pitch   uncertainty   that   is   less   than   the
corresponding linewidth  uncertainty  because  many  features
have   some   degree   of   mirror   image   symmetry   between
opposite edges.)
5. 1.5  feature  (lithographic)  —  region  within  a  single
continuous boundary, and attached to a reference plane,
that has a defining physical property (parameter) that is
distinct from the region outside the boundary. <!-- -->[Adapted
from SEMI P28.]<!-- -->
NOTE  3:    In  general  a  feature  is  a  3-dimensional  object,  but
some  features  can  be  adequately  modeled  as  2-dimensional
objects.
5. 1.5.1  feature  boundary  —  surface  defined  by  a  user-
specified   property,   such   as   a   threshold,   maximum
gradient,   etc.,   of   the   parameter   distinguishing   that
feature from  its  surroundings.  Open  features,  such  as
vias or spaces between lines, may be bounded in height
by an additional plane parallel to the reference plane.
5. 1.5.2  feature   edge   —   that   part   of   the   feature
boundary used  to  define  the  feature  size  or  linewidth.
The criteria used must be specified.
5. 1.5.3  feature  height  —  dimension  of  the  specified
bounding  box  perpendicular  to  the  reference  plane.
May  also  refer  to  feature  depth  below  the  substrate,  as
in  contact  holes.  Although  feature  height  is  sometimes
referred   to   as   feature thickness,   this   usage   is   not
recommended  because  “thickness”  sometimes  alludes
to “width.”
5. 1.5.4  feature  model  —  a  solid  geometrical  shape,
with   well-defined   parameters,   e.g.,   length,   width,
height,  centroid,  etc.  (Figure  1),  meant  to  approximate
the actual shape of a feature boundary.</p><p>Figure 3
Examples   of   line   edge   bounding   boxes   and   the
resulting  default  centerline and linewidth.  Since  the
top  of  Line  A  is  not  parallel  to  the  substrate,  the
generalized linewidth  bounding  box  definition  (b)  is
used.  Line  edge  asperities  at  the  substrate  were
judged  not  to  be  relevant  to  the  function  of  this
feature  and  were  excluded  from  the  outer  line  edge
bounding boxes.</p><p>NOTE 4:  A rectangular solid is often used to represent a line;
a different extruded polygon may better represent the shape of
the line. A hemisphere may best represent a solder bump.
The  more  complex  the  model,  more  degrees  of  freedom  are
available  to  better  fit  the  model  to  the  feature,  and  more
dimensional  parameters  are  needed  to  describe  the  feature’s
size.    The    feature    model    is    a    simplified    geometric
approximation   of   the   actual   feature,   the   bounding   boxes
represent limits on the space occupied by the feature model.
The size or position of a feature can be described by the size
or    position    of    the    feature    model    with    appropriate
uncertainties,  or  by  the  sizes  or  positions  of  the  bounding
boxes.  This  choice  is  left  to  the  user,  and  in  many  of  these
definitions the terms can be interchanged. Bounding boxes are
useful   because   they   make   the   measurement   uncertainty
explicit,  and  because  an  application  of  the  measurement  data
may require only inner or outer bounds.
5. 1.5.5  feature placement — (a) coordinates describing
the  position  of  the  centroid of  the  specified  bounding
box projected  onto  the  reference  plane  relative  to  a
coordinate   system   in   that   plane.   (b)   coordinates
describing positions of the feature’s edges.
5. 1.5.6  feature   size — dimensions   of   the   specified
feature model or bounding box.
5. 1.5.7  nominal   feature   size   —   the    intended    or
specified dimension of a feature.</p><p>SEMI P35-0704 © SEMI 2000, 2004 4</p><p>Figure 4

edge,   between   specified   inner and outer   linewidth
bounding  boxes  encompassing  the  edge  of  the  feature.

the feature edge. See Figure 3.
NOTE  5:    The  underlying  concept  here  is  the  same  as  for  a
feature bounding  box;  only  the  perspective  is  different.  If  a
feature  is  described  using  a  pair  of  inner and outer  linewidth
bounding  boxes,  then  the  widths  of  the  corresponding  line
edge bounding boxes illustrate the component of the linewidth

bounding    a    specified    line    length    segment;    (b)

additional  specification  for  the  linewidth,  such  as  at

APPENDIX 1
SOME GENERAL NOTES ON LINEWIDTH METROLOGY
NOTICE:    The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  P35  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot
procedures on April 22, 2004.</p><p>A1-1    A  metrology  process  can  be  represented  by  the
operation</p><p>process model ⊕ feature model → output model.</p><p>A1-1.1  Here    the process    model    represents    the
metrology process. These models are abstractions of the
complex   realities   they   represent,   a   simplification
usually required in order to make the modeling tractable
and  the  measurement  practical.  The  output  model  of
this  metrology  process  is  the  feature  model  (Section
5. 5.4) with the metrology results attached, including the
associated    measurement    uncertainty.    Measurement
uncertainty  arises  from  inevitable  differences  between
both the process and feature models and their respective
realities.  The  measurement  error  (Section  5.10)  is  the
difference  between  the  measurement  result  and  the
unknown  true  value,  and  the  measurement  uncertainty
(Section  5.11)  is  expressed  as  a  confidence  interval
representing  the  variance  of  the  measurement  errors.
The   measurement   uncertainty   includes   components
from  model  infidelity  in  addition  to  scale  calibration,
repeatability,  environmental  factors,  etc.  A  confidence
interval  of  95%  (or  2σ for  normally  distributed  errors)
is    used    in    the    examples,    in    accordance    with
international custom. That is, the likelihood that the true
value  of  the  measurand (Section  5.9)  lies  within  the
range  (measurement  result  ± measurement  uncertainty)
is 95%.
A1-1.2  A manufacturing process can be represented in
a  similar  manner.  In  particular,  if  that  process  is  wafer
exposure,   then   the   same   feature   model   for   the
photomask  features  can  be  used  for  both  the  mask
metrology and exposure processes:</p><p>exposure model ⊕ photomask feature model
→ wafer feature model.</p><p>A1-1.3      Errors   and   uncertainties   in   the   photomask
feature model propagate through the exposure model to
become  manufacturing  errors—differences  between  a
wafer feature’s size or placement and its target value—
and   manufacturing   uncertainties.   In   analogy   with
measurement  uncertainty,  tolerances  on  wafer  features
encompass  mask  measurement  uncertainties,  including
differences  between  the  models  and  their  respective
realities,   as   well   as   the   effects   of   tolerances   for
exposure parameters and photomask features. The mask
error  enhancement  factor  (MEEF)  and  other  optical
proximity   effects   are   good   examples   of   the   wafer
exposure  model  operating  on  photomask  feature  size
and    placement    variations    to    produce    nonlinear
variations  in  wafer  feature  size  and  placement  under
some conditions.
A1-2  Real   microlithographic features (Section   5.5)
often  have  irregular  shapes  and  rough  edges;  it  is
neither  possible  nor  necessary  to  know  the  exact  shape
of a feature to be measured. The purpose of the feature
bounding boxes (Section 5.1) defined here is to account
for such edge details as top-to-bottom runout and along-
the-line  irregularities  that  are  often  observed.  In  such
cases  the  bounding  boxes  help  define  the  measurand
(Section  5.9).  To  the  extent  that  such  details  are  not
known,  not  relevant,  or  too  complex  to  be  considered,
the bounding boxes represent the feature with a simpler
geometry  and  mix  these  disregarded  details  into  the
measurement uncertainty. For the ideal line with known
edge  geometry  and  no  edge  irregularities,  the  inner,
mean,  and  outer  linewidth  bounding  boxes  (Sections
5. 8.3–5.8.5) can be identical and the line edge bounding
box (Section  5.6)  can  have  zero  width.  The  bounding
box approach simplifies metrology issues for the quasi-
thin-film        features        often        encountered        in
microlithography.    Extension    of    the    concept    to
structures  with  nonplanar  top  surfaces  or  extending
below the reference plane (Section 5.14) becomes more
complicated.
A1-3    A  great  deal  of  flexibility  has  been  incorporated
into  some  of  these  definitions.  This  is  because  the
definition  of  a  measurand (Section  5.9)  can  depend  on
the  purpose  for  which  a  measurement  is  made,  and  the
measurement  error  depends  on  the  definition  of  the
measurand.  It  is  up  to  the  user  to  specify  or  define  the
measurand in a way that suits his present purpose and in
an  unambiguous  way.  Otherwise  interpretation  of  the
measurement    result    may    be    in    error    and    the
measurement   uncertainty   may   be   meaningless   or
impossible   to   ascertain.   In   other   words,   the   “true
values”  of  feature  edge  positions,  centerline (Section
5. 3), centroid (Section  5.4),  and  linewidth (Section
5. 8.1),   can   depend   on   the   purpose   to   which   the
corresponding    measurement    results    are    put.    The
definitions given here allow for some flexibility so they</p><p>SEMI P35-0704 © SEMI 2000, 2004 8
can be made consistent with the ultimate purpose of the
measurements.
A1-4    The  inner  and  outer  linewidth  bounding  boxes
need not have the same shape, but their widths must be
unambiguously  defined.  A  rectangular  shape  for  both
will   result   in   a   centerline,   centroid,   and   linewidth
independent of height above the substrate, but may also
result  in  a  larger  interval  between  the  inner  and  outer
linewidth bounding boxes. The figure 95% represents 2
standard    deviations    of    the    Gaussian    probability
distribution  of  possible  values  for  the  linewidth.  The
multiplier  value  of  2  (the  “coverage  factor”)  is  also
often  used  even  if  the  distribution  is  not  Gaussian
<!-- -->[reference  Section  3.2]<!-- -->,  but  then  the  interpretation  of
95%   confidence   no   longer   applies.   Three   standard
deviations  or  some  other  multiple  may  be  used  if  so
specified.
A1-5      The   probability   distribution   and   expectation
value  for  the  position  of  an  edge  within  the  line  edge
bounding  box  are  determined  as  described  in  ANSI
Z540-2 <!-- -->[reference Section 3.2]<!-- -->. Default values for these
assume the edge is equally likely to be anywhere inside
the line edge bounding box. In that case the expectation
value  of  the  line  edge  location  is  the  center  of  the  line
edge  bounding  box  (i.e., the  linewidth  is  the  width  of
the mean  linewidth  bounding  box  <!-- -->[Section  5.8.3]<!-- -->),  and
the  edge  position  uncertainty  (at  the  95%  confidence
level) is 0.577 × width of line edge bounding box. The
corresponding linewidth    measurement    uncertainty
(Section 5.8.7) component is 0.816 × width of line edge
bounding   box   if   the   right   and   left   edge   location
uncertainties are uncorrelated, and 1.154 × width of line
edge  bounding  box  if  they  are  mirror-image  correlated
(as  is  often  approximately  the  case).  See  reference
Section 3.2, page 13.
A1-6    In  most  cases,  the  width  or  centroid  or  edge
positions  of  the  bounding  box  is  measured  from  its
image  in  a  metrology  tool;  inferring  the  width  of  the
bounding    box    from    this    image    usually    requires
modeling  of  the  image-forming  process.  The  bounding
box  should  be  constructed  so  that  its  image  in  the
metrology tool can be modeled with the modeling tools
available.   If   the   image   is   not   modeled   accurately,
additional     measurement     uncertainty     will     accrue

common  and  important  specifications  of  magnification
references which are used for calibrating magnifications
of  critical  dimension  measurement  scanning  electron
microscopes   (CD-SEMs),   and   as   the   result   (2)   to
provide  magnification  references  which  are  easy  for
anyone to use.
2  Scope</li><li>1    It   is   preferable   that   design,   ma nufacture   and
purchase   specifications   for   CD-SEM   magnification
references conform to this guideline.</li><li>2   This  standard  does  not  purport   to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Referenced Standards</li><li>1  None.
4  Terminology</li><li>1   CD-SEM  magnification  refere nce
 a  CD-SEM
magnification  reference  is  defined  as  a  standard  for
calibrating  magnifications  of  a  said  CD-SEM  through
mounting    the    standard    on    the    specimen    stage,
measuring the dimensions of reference patterns formed
on the standard, determining the difference between the
measurement  value  and  the  true  or  reference  value  of
the   reference   patterns,   and   adjusting   the   CD-SEM
parameters to bring the difference zero.</li><li>1.1   There  are  two  types  of  CD-SE M  magnification
references:  one  is  a  wafer  on  which  reference  patterns
are   formed;   another   is   a   chip   on   which   reference
patterns  are  formed.    Hereinafter,  the  former  will  be
referred to as “wafer-type magnification reference,” and
the latter will be referred to as “chip-type magnification
reference.”</li><li>2   edge  roughness   Edge  rough ness  refers  to  edge
variations  seen  in  the  SEM  images,  and  is  defined  as
the  distance,  within  a  field  of  view,  between  the  peak
line  and  the  valley  line,  where  the  peak  line  means  the
line which runs through the highest peak and is parallel
to the pattern-edge mean line, the valley line means the
line which runs through the lowest valley and is parallel
to  the  pattern-edge  mean  line,  and  the  pattern-edge
mean  line  conforms  to  the  expected  pattern-edge  line.
Here, a peak is the tip of a convex section, and a valley
is the deepest part of a concave section (See Figure 1).

APPENDIX 1
NOTES
NOTE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of
SEMI  P36  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot  procedures
on   March   1,   2000   by   the   Japanese   Regional   Standards
Committee.
A1-1      Reference   patterns   for   adjusting   CD-SEM
magnification using their pitches and reference patterns
for  optimizing  pattern-edge  determination  parameters
using their widths
A1-2    The  following  procedures  are  generally  applied
to critical dimension measurements using CD-SEMs: an
electron   beam   linearly   scans   across   the   measured
pattern,    secondary  and/or  reflected  electrons  emitted
from  every  electron-beam  incident  point  are  collected
to    form    its    intensity    profile,    pattern    edges    are
determined  on  the  intensity  profile  using  a  designated
pattern-edge  determination  method,  and  the  measure-
ment value of the width of the pattern is obtained from
the distance between the two pattern edges.
A1-3      Therefore,   measurement   errors   of   CD-SEM
measurements can be partitioned into two components:
one  is  magnification  error  and  another  is  pattern-edge
determination  error.  Magnification  error  is  caused  by
variation   of   the   equipment   conditions   such   as   the
sampling  pitch  and  incident  angle  of  electron  beam.
Pattern-edge   determination   error   is   affected   by   the
manner     of     measurement     such     as     pattern-edge
determination     algorithm     used     and     pattern-edge
determination parameters used, and the properties of the
specimen such as pattern topography (e.g., pattern-edge
slope) and pattern material.
A1-4      Magnification   error,   including   inter-machine
magnification   error,   can   be   detected   and   corrected
through  measuring  pitches  of  reference  patterns,  and
pattern-edge  determination  error  could  be  detected  and
corrected  through  measuring  widths  of  the  reference
patterns  practical  reference  patterns  are  available  for
measuring  their  widths.  However,  it  seems  extremely
difficult   to   produce   practical   reference   patterns   for
measuring  their  widths;  the  source  of  the  problem  lies
in  the  physics  of  electron  beam  image  formation  and
not   because   the   reference   patterns   are   somehow
inadequate   because   of   the   following   reasons:   (a)
reference pattern can not be determined uniquely, since
intensity profiles obtained are different from each other
dependent  on  pattern  topography  and  pattern  materials
even if the width of every reference pattern is the same,
(b) it is technologically difficult to solve the problem of
width  change  due  to  the  contamination  which  changes
the  measurement  value  of  pattern  width  dependent  on
measurement time.

are  defined  in  four  classes.    The  particular  class  of
thermal  expansion  material  used  shall  be  agreed  upon
between  user  and  supplier.    The  thermal  expansion
properties  of  the  substrate  are  defined  over  the  entire
temperature range shown in Table 3.</p><p>SEMI P37-1102 © SEMI 2001, 2002 2

upon   between   user   and   supplier.      The   substrate
including these optional additional layers must meet all
requirements outlined in this standard.
8  Flatness Specifications
8. 1  The   flatness  requirements  for  the  substrate  are
defined in four classes.  The particular class of flatness
shall   be   agreed   upon   between   user   and   supplier.
Substrates  shall  be  supplied  with  front  and  back    sides

6  Area covered by requirements
6. 1  Layer  Quality  Area  ó  A  layer  quality  area  with
width,   W
L
,   and   height,   D
L
,   shall   be   agreed   upon
between user and supplier. Figure 2 shows the labeling
of  the  dimensions  of  the  layer  quality  area.    The  layer
quality area may be smaller than the edge length, L, of
the mask substrate, which is defined in SEMI P37.  The
layer  quality  area  is  the  region  where  the  multilayer
stack  and  absorber  stack  properties  are  specified  in
Section  7.    The  multilayer,  capping,  absorber  layer(s)
and buffer layer properties are also specified only in the
layer quality area.
6. 1.1    Specifications  for  the  layers  and  layer  stacks
outside  the  layer  quality  area  are  agreed  upon  between
user and supplier.
6. 2  Defect Quality Area ó A defect quality area, with
width,   W
d
,   and   height,   D
d
,   shall   be   agreed   upon
between  the  user  and  supplier.  Figure  3  shows  the
labeling  of  the  dimensions  of  the  defect  quality  area.
The  defect  quality  area  may  or  may  not  be  identical  to
the  area  described  in  Section  9.1  of  SEMI  P37.  The
defect quality area may be smaller than the edge length,
L, of the mask substrate, which is defined in SEMI P37.
The  defect  quality  area  is  not  necessarily  the  same  as
the layer quality area described in Section 6.1.
6. 2.1      Specifications   for   defects   outside   the   defect
quality area are agreed upon between user and supplier.
7  Layer properties
7. 1    The  multilayer  stack  attributes  and  properties  are
defined in Table 3.  The EUV reflectivity requirements
are defined in Tables 4 and 5, and the EUV reflectivity
uniformity requirements are defined in Table 6.  Figure
4  illustrates  the  EUV  reflectivity  parameters.    The
median  wavelength  is  defined  as  shown,  and  the  peak
reflectivity  might  not  occur  at  the  median  wavelength.
The   optical   properties   of   the   multilayer   stack   at
wavelengths  besides  EUV  wavelengths  are  defined  in
Table 10.
7. 2      The   buffer   layer   requirements   are   shown   in
Table  7.    The  optical  properties  of  the  buffer  layer  at
wavelengths  besides  EUV  wavelengths  are  defined  in
Table  10.  The  reflectivity  requirements  in  Table  10
apply  to  the  buffer  layer  as  deposited  on  top  of  the
multilayer  stack.    By  mutual  agreement  between  the
user  and  supplier,  the  range  of  wavelengths  for  mean
reflectivity  requirement  may  be  reduced  to  a  subset  of
the range shown in Table 10.
7. 3    The  absorber  layer  requirements  are  defined  in
Table 8.
7. 4  The requirements for the absorber stack are defined
in Table 9.  The optical properties of the absorber stack
at wavelengths besides EUV wavelengths are shown in
Table 11. The reflectivity requirements in Tables 9 and
11 apply to the absorber stack as deposited on top of the
multilayer  stack.    By  mutual  agreement  between  the
user  and  supplier,  the  range  of  wavelengths  for  mean
reflectivity  requirement  may  be  reduced  to  a  subset  of
the range shown in Table 11.
7. 5  At all points on the backside of the mask blank, the
sheet  resistance  should  be  ≤  100  Ohms/square.    The
requirements  for  the  conductive  layer  on  the  backside
of the substrate are shown in Table 12.
8  Defects
8. 1    The  multilayer  stack  must  be  inspected  for  defects
before   deposition   of   the   buffer   layer   and   absorber
layer(s).  The  multilayer  stack  must  meet  the  defect
requirements shown in Table 13.
8. 2        The    absorber    stack    must    meet    the    defect
requirements  shown  in  Table  14.    For  Type  3  mask
blanks,  the  resist  and  absorber  stack  must  meet  the
defect requirements shown in Table 14.
8. 3      The   location   and   size   of   all   defects   in   the
mulitlayer  or  absorber  stacks  that  were  located  by  the
supplier  will  be  provided  to  the  user.    The  required
accuracy and reference point(s) for these locations will
be negotiated between user and supplier.
8. 4      Mask   blanks   must   meet   the   backside   defect
requirements in Section 9.3 of SEMI P37.
9  Flatness Specifications
9. 1  The flatness of the mask blank shall be agreed upon
between user and supplier.</p><p>SEMI P38-1103 © SEMI 2002, 2003 3
10  Sampling
10. 1    Unless  otherwise  specified,  appropriate  sample
sizes shall be selected from each lot in accordance with
ANSI/ASQC  Z1.4.  Each  quality  characteristic  shall  be
assigned    an    acceptable    quality    level    (AQL)    in

1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  The  purpose  of  this  specification  is  to  define  an
interchange  and  encapsulation  format  for  hierarchical
integrated circuit mask layout information.</li><li>2  Background  —  In  the  fall  of  2001,  SEMI’s  Data
Path  Task  Force  formed  a  working  group  to  define  a
successor to the venerable GDSII Stream format, which
had  served  the  I.C.  industry  as  a  de  facto  standard  for
layout  interchange  for  more  than  two  decades.  The  old
format,  limited  by  16-bit  and  32-bit  internal  integer
fields,  by  its  inefficient  representation  of  cell-native
geometric figures, and by high structural overhead, was
becoming difficult to use for leading-edge designs, and
file  sizes  were  becoming  unwieldy,  in  some  cases
growing  to  many  tens  of  gigabytes.  The  successor
format was chartered with several overall goals:
• Achieve  at  least  an  order-of-magnitude  file  size
improvement compared to GDSII Stream.
• Remove   all   16-bit   and   32-bit   integer   width
restrictions—make   the   new   format   fully   64-bit
capable.
• Efficiently  represent  cells  with  large  payloads  of
flat native geometric figures.
• Provide  a  richer  information  palette  to  facilitate
interchange  of  layout-related  information  between
design and manufacturing.</li><li>2.1  In  the  months  leading  up  to  the  formation  of  the
SEMI  Data  Path  Task  Force,  International  Sematech
sponsored a series of meetings focusing on Mask EDA
issues.  Many  of  the  Task  Force  participants  were  also
involved   in   these   Sematech   meetings,   and   carried
forward  much  useful  information  from  those  sessions
into the definition of this specification.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This  format  is  designed  primarily  to  encapsulate
hierarchical   mask   layout   for   interchange   between
systems such as EDA software, mask writing tools, and
mask inspection/repair tools.</li><li>2  This  format  is  designed  to  be  both  hardware-  and
software-independent.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  Use   of   extension   records   such   as   XNAME,
XELEMENT,     and     XGEOMETRY     may     impair
interoperability  between  tools.  It  is  recommended  that
these extensions be used primarily for prototyping, and
that  interoperability  be  maintained  through  the  formal
inclusion of extensions to this specification.

OASIS are found within the text of the paragraphs that
contain them.
5. 2.2  cell  —  a  named  object  in  a  layout  hierarchy,
containing   native   geometric   information,   annotation
information, and/or placements of other cells.
5. 2.3  geometry  —  a  two-dimensional  geometric  figure
such as a polygon, rectangle, trapezoid, path, circle, etc.
with inherent attributes of layer and datatype.</p><p>4

space    of    another    cell    at    a    particular    location,
orientation,    and    scale.    Cell    placement    is    the
fundamental  mechanism  which makes hierarchy within
the OASIS file possible.
5. 2.5  property — an annotation element consisting of a

6  OASIS Basics
6. 1  An  OASIS  file  is  a  sequence  of  bytes  divided  into  records.  The  length  of  a  record  is  discernible  from  its
structure and is not explicit (in contrast to GDSII Stream, where all record lengths are explicit).
6. 2  An  OASIS  file  has  the  following  overall  syntax  (using  the  modified  BNF  notation  described  in  Section  36  on
page 27). Individual record types appear in bold uppercase and are described in more detail in following sections.</p><p>oasis-file -&gt; magic-bytes START { CBLOCK | PAD | PROPERTY | cell | name }<em> END
name -&gt; { CELLNAME | TEXTSTRING | LAYERNAME | PROPNAME | PROPSTRING | XNAME }
cell -&gt; { CELL { CBLOCK | PAD | PROPERTY | XYRELATIVE | XYABSOLUTE | element }</em> }
element -&gt; { geometry | PLACEMENT | TEXT | XELEMENT }
geometry -&gt; { RECTANGLE | POLYGON | PATH | TRAPEZOID | CTRAPEZOID | CIRCLE | XGEOMETRY }</p><ol start="6"><li>3  An  OASIS  file  may  represent  a  complete  layout  hierarchy,  a  portion  of  a  layout  hierarchy,  or  multiple  layout
hierarchies.  These  interpretations  are  not  intrinsic  to  the  format  and  are  governed  by  application  semantics  only.
Each OASIS file must be syntactically complete—it must begin with magic-bytes and contain at least a START
and END record.</li><li>4  The  magic-bytes  element  is  a  sequence  of  13  ASCII  characters:  “%SEMI-OASISCRNL”  where
CRNL  represents  the  ASCII  hexadecimal  sequence  0D 0A.  It  is  provided  as  a  recognition  signature  to  make
OASIS  files  easily  identifiable  to  the  UNIX  file  utility.  (The  intent  of  the  carriage  return  and  newline  is  to  help
detect corruption by FTP programs operating in non-binary mode.)</li><li>5  EXCEPTION HANDLING
—  OASIS  processors  should  treat  any  deviation  from  the  syntax  presented  in  this
document as a fatal error. OASIS readers are not required to implement syntax-check preprocessing in order to be
considered compliant with this specification. The sequence in which exceptions are detected and reported is entirely
application-dependent. In addition, for access requests which do not require the interpretation of the entire file (such
as retrieval of a single cell or a subset of the cells within the file), this specification does not require OASIS readers
to exhaustively check the validity of the entire file.
7  Data Constructs</li><li>1  Bytes</li><li>1.1  A byte is a fixed-length 8-bit value. Bit patterns for bytes are shown with the least significant bit (bit 0) on the
right.</li><li>2  Integers</li><li>2.1  An unsigned-integer  is  an  N-byte  (N  &gt;  0)  integer  value.  The  low-order  byte  appears  first
in  the  OASIS
format. Integer byte length is variable and integers are represented as byte-continuations where the most significant
bit of each byte except the last in the chain is a 1; the remaining seven bits in each byte are concatenated to form the
actual integer value itself. There are no restrictions on integer byte length (and hence, magnitude).</li></ol><p>Figure 1
