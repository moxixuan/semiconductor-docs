The EH&S Committeehas voted that implementation of the information isOPTIONAL before the effective date.26.1 Equipment should be identified with a laserproduct classification based on the laser energyaccessible during operation, per the applicable standard.NOTE 122: A Class 1 label may be required in somejurisdictions, but is not currently required in the United States.26.1.1 The laser energy (or power), wavelength, andtemporal mode (continuous wave or pulsed) should beidentified in the documentation provided to the user.NOTE 123: The laser product classification for someequipment will be Class 1 or 2, even though an embeddedlaser is of a higher hazard classification. 26.1.1.1 If pulsed, the pulse repetition rate, pulseduration and description of the pulse waveform shouldbe identified in the documentation provided to the user.26.1.1.2 For Class 3b or 4 embedded laser systems, theabove information and the physical location of the lasersources within the laser product should be identified inthe documentation provided to the user and in themaintenance manual.26.1.2 Equipment should not exceed the laser productclassification of Class 2; however, individual lasersmay exceed this classification prior to integration intothe final equipment assembly.26.2 Equipment, including beam diagnostic oralignment tools, should be designed to prevent injuryfrom all lasers during normal operation, and shouldminimize risk of injury during maintenance or service.Potential exposures should be controlled in thefollowing order of preference:26.2.1 Engineering controls (e.g., enclosures,shielding, filters, use of fiber optics to transmit energy,interlocks).26.2.2 Temporary enclosures or control measures formaintenance, service, and non-routine tasks.26.2.3 Administrative controls (e.g., written warnings,standard operating procedures, labeling).26.2.4 Personal protective equipment.NOTE 124: Temporary enclosures and personal protectiveequipment are considered to be administrative controls,because they require human action to implement.NOTE 125: Certain classes of laser products are regulatedaround the world. Regulations and licensing requirementsmay cover activities such as importing, exporting,distributing, demonstrating, installing, servicing, and usingthese laser products.26.3 The equipment supplier should provide thefollowing in the operation and maintenance manuals: a description of laser-related hazards presentduring operation, maintenance, or service, andmethods to minimize the hazard; justification for any procedures that require a lasercontrolled area and the dimensions of this hazardzone; administrative controls used in maintenance andservice activities; and a description of necessary personal protectiveequipment.26.4 The following detailed information should beavailable for the evaluator:"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 2 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S2-0703aE \xa9 SEMI 1991, 200431  justification for when engineering controls are notfeasible to limit exposure during operation ormaintenance tasks, and how administrative controlsprovide equivalent protection (see Section 26.2);and documentation showing compliance with anappropriate international laser product safety orindustry standard, or the national standard forcountry of use. 27 Sound Pressure Level27.1 Equipment should be designed to controlexposures to sound pressure levels equal to or greaterthan 80 dBA continuous or intermittent sound pressurelevel, and 120 dB instantaneous (impulse) soundpressure level.NOTE 126: It is recommended that efforts be made todecrease sound pressure levels as they approach 80 dBA (i.e.,77 to 80 dBA), due to the additive sound pressure level effectsof multiple pieces of equipment in the same vicinity.27.2 The order of preference for controlling exposuresis as follows:27.2.1 Engineering Controls (e.g., source soundpressure level reduction, absorption, enclosures,barriers, acoustic dampening)  At a minimum, thedesign of the engineering controls should consider thesound pressure levels and type, the frequency, and theappropriate control technologies.27.2.2 Administrative Controls  Acceptableadministrative controls should be limited tosupplemental hazard warning labels and operatingprocedures.NOTE 127: Noise labeling is typically implemented as signslocated in the users facility.27.3 Sound level surveys should be conducted by themanufacturer during equipment development forequipment that may emit hazardous sound pressurelevels.27.3.1 The survey should be conducted in accordancewith a recognized standard. In addition, the followingtest criteria should be applied:27.3.1.1 The equipment mode of operation during thesound pressure level tests should simulate as closely aspossible the actual modes and operating positions thatmay be experienced by the equipment user.27.3.1.2 Measurements should be taken in locationsthat best simulate actual positions of operators relativeto the equipment. As a general guideline, themicrophone should be traversed 1 meter from theequipment, 1.2 meters above the ground to simulateseated operators, 1.5 meters above the ground to simulate standing operators, and 3.5 meters (or as far aspossible) away from the nearest walls or sound-reflecting objects. Measurements are taken 360 degreesaround the equipment wherever possible.Table 2 Sound Pressure Level Test CriteriaNOTE 128: Background level may be subtracted using anaccepted method. If the sound pressure level difference is lessthan 3 dBA, the contribution of the source from thebackground cannot be adequately distinguished and thesurvey results would not be valid for values over 80 dBA.

A2-2 Exhaust OptimizationA2-2.1 Exhaust optimization is the use of goodventilation design to create efficient equipment exhaust.The design and measurement methods discussed belowconfirm that equipment exhaust is acting as themanufacturer intended. This information is not meant toprohibit alternate methods of achieving or verifyinggood ventilation design. References for ventilationdesign are included at the end of this Appendix.A2-2.2 Design RecommendationsA2-2.2.1 Equipment exhaust design can attempt toreduce inefficient static pressure losses caused by:friction losses from materials; openings, and ductgeometries (elbows, duct expansions or contractions);turbulent air flow; fans; internal fittings such as blastgates and dampers; directional changes in airflow.A2-2.2.2 Other good design principles can includeminimizing distance between the source and hood, andreducing enclosure volumes.A2-2.2.3 For non-chemical issues such as heat fromelectrical equipment, heat recapture rather than exhaustmay be appropriate.A2-2.2.4 The possible impact of highly directionallaminar airflow found in most fabs should beconsidered when designing equipment exhaust.A2-2.3 Recommended Equipment Controls  Thelocation of internal blast gates or dampers inside equipment, and their appropriate settings, should beclearly identified. The number of equipment dampersand blast gates should be minimized. Gates/dampersshould be lockable or otherwise securable. Staticpressure or flow sensors installed on equipment by themanufacturer should have sufficient sensitivity andaccuracy to measure exhaust flowrate fluctuations thatplace the equipment out of prescribed ranges.A2-2.4 Recommended Measurement/ValidationMethod  Measurements should be made to identifyoptimal exhaust levels and confirm that safety andprocess requirements are being addressed. Themanufacturer should be able to identify any criticalequipment locations for chemical capture, and quantifyappropriate exhaust values. Multiple validation/measurement methods may be needed.A2-2.4.1 Measurements should be done afterequipment components are assembled.A2-2.4.2 Computer modeling can be done to predictexhaust flow and hazardous material transport inequipment by solving fluid mechanics conservation ofenergy and mass equations. Modeling can be used inthe equipment design stage or to improve existingequipment. Computer models should be verifiedexperimentally, using one or more of the methodsdiscussed below.A2-2.4.3 Tracer gas testing provides a method to testthe integrity of hoods by simulating gas emission andmeasuring the effectiveness of controls. Testing until"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 7 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S2-0703aE \xa9 SEMI 1991, 2004 36 there is a failure, and then slightly increasing the flowrate until the test is successful, can be used to helpminimize air flow specifications.A2-2.4.4 Chemical air or wipe monitoring can be usedto confirm that chemical transport is not occurring intounintended areas of the equipment.A2-2.4.5 Velocity profiling will confirm expectedairflows, the direction of flow, and the effect ofdistance.A2-2.4.6 Vapor visualization will confirm expectedairflows, the direction of flow, and the effect ofdistance. Vapor visualization is the observation ofaerosols (e.g., aerosols generated by using water, liquidnitrogen, or dry ice) so that exhaust flow patterns canbe observed. Smoke tubes or aerosols may also be used,however they can produce contamination. A2-3 Chemical Laboratory Fume Hoods, PartsCleaning HoodsLab fume hoods and part cleaning hoods are designedto control emission by enclosing a process on five sidesand containing the emission within the hood.A2-3.1 Design RecommendationsA2-3.1.1 Fully enclosed on five sides, open on one sidefor employee access and process/parts placement andremovals.A2-3.1.2 Front (employee access side) should beprovided with sliding door and/or sash.A2-3.1.3 Minimize size of the hood based on processsize.A2-3.1.4 Minimize front opening size based on size ofprocess and employee access needs.A2-3.1.5 Ensure hood construction materials arecompatible with chemicals used.A2-3.2 Control Specifications  Face velocity is thespecification generally used with hoods open on onlyone side.A2-3.2.1 Generally acceptable laboratory fume hoodface velocities range from 0.40 to 0.60 m/s (80120fpm) with no single measurement \xb1 20 % of average.0.64 to 0.76 m/s (125150 fpm) is recommended forhoods in which carcinogens or reproductive toxicantsmay be used.A2-3.2.2 Velocities as low as 0.30 to 0.40 m/s (6080fpm) can be effective but require no cross drafts orcompeting air movement in the work area.A2-3.2.3 An average face velocity of 0.50 m/s (100fpm) is generally found to be acceptable in mostapplications. A2-3.2.4 Face velocities of 0.64 to 0.76 m/s (125 to150 fpm) may be required when a lab hood is installedin an area with laminar air flow.A2-3.2.5 Face velocity above 0.76 m/s (150 fpm)should be avoided to prevent eddying caused by a lowerpressure area in front of an employee standing at thehood.A2-3.3 Recommended Measurement/ValidationMethodA2-3.3.1 The preferred method is measurement ofaverage face velocity and hood static pressure.Measurements are taken with a velometer oranemometer. Multiple measurements are taken in agrid, at least 10 to 40 per square meter (14 per squarefoot) of open area, in the plane opening of the hood.This allows representative, evenly spacedmeasurements to be taken (see also open-surface tanks).A2-3.3.2 Additional confirmation by visualizationcheck of containment using smoke or vapor testing.A2-3.3.3 ASHRAE Method 110, or equivalent (useappropriate sections), for tracer gas testing of lab hoodsmay be used as a supplemental verification providedthat an accurate emission rate can be defined.(ASHRAE 110 lists 3 tests: as manufactured, asused, and as installed. The as manufactured test isthe test that is used most frequently.) A2-4 Wet StationsWet stations are slotted hoods designed to capturelaminar air flow while also capturing wet processemissions from the work area. Wet stations can be openon the front, top and both sides (it is usually preferableto enclose as much as possible).A2-4.1 Design RecommendationsA2-4.1.1 Slots should be provided uniformly along thelength of the hood for even distribution of airflow.A2-4.1.2 Additional lip exhaust slots should beprovided around tanks or sinks to control emissions.A2-4.1.3 The plenum behind the slots should be sizedto ensure even distribution of static pressure. Theseslots should be designed to ensure adequate airflow isprovided by the side slots, and to minimize turbulencethat could reduce exhaust performance.A2-4.1.4 Velocity along length of slot should not varyby more than 10% of the average slot velocity.A2-4.1.5 Additional use of end or side panels/bafflescan reduce negative impact of side drafts."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 8 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S2-0703aE \xa9 SEMI 1991, 200437 A2-4.1.6 Exhaust volume settings should considerlaminar air flow volumes and be balanced to minimizeturbulence and to ensure capture.A2-4.1.7 The station design should consider airflowpatterns in the operating zone to minimize turbulenthorizontal airflow patterns into and across the workdeck.A2-4.1.8 Additional considerations to reduce exhaustdemand include providing covered tanks, and recessingtanks below deck level.A2-4.2 Control SpecificationsA2-4.2.1 Wet station specifications are complicated bythe fact that wet stations generally do not have an easilydefinable face velocity to measure. A number ofmethods have been used and are all acceptable if usedconsistently and provided documentation indicateschemical containment meets the 1% of the OEL atdistances beyond the plane of penetration at the exteriorof the wet station.A2-4.2.2 Maintain an average capture velocity of 0.33to 0.50 m/s (65100 fpm) immediately above a bath.A2-4.2.3 Calculate the total exhaust volumerequirement by determining the total volumetric flow oflaminar air hitting the deck and increasing this value by20 to 25%.A2-4.2.4 For some wet stations that are partiallyenclosed from the top, an artificial plane opening(face) can be defined where the downward laminarair flow penetrates the capture zone (at face velocity)of the wet station. Depending on the hood design andlaminar air flow provided, average face velocities canrange from 0.20 to 0.50 m/s (40 to 100 fpm). Themeasurement location can greatly influence themeasured face velocity; therefore, this method shouldbe supplemented with at least one of the precedingmethods for greater accuracy and reproducibility at theusers facility.A2-4.3 Recommended Measurement/ValidationMethodA2-4.3.1 Confirmation of capture using vaporvisualization.A2-4.3.2 Confirmation of laminar flow of make up airinto the station using vapor visualization.A2-4.3.3 Tracer gas testing may be used assupplemental verification, provided an emission ratecan be accurately defined. A2-5 Supplemental ExhaustSupplemental exhaust, if not designed into theequipment, can be provided by a flexible duct with a tapered hood. This can be placed in the work area toremove potential contaminants before they enter thebreathing zone. Supplemental exhaust is frequentlyused during maintenance or service.A2-5.1 Design RecommendationsA2-5.1.1 Retractable or movable non-combustible flexducting for easy reach and placement within 150 to 300mm (6 to 12 inches) of potential emissions to becontrolled.A2-5.1.2 Manual damper at hood to allow for localcontrol, i.e., shut off when not required.A2-5.1.3 Tapered hood with a plane opening as aminimum. The additional use of flanges or canopies toenclose the process will result in improved efficiency.A2-5.2 Control SpecificationsNOTE A2-1: This is one equation that is most commonlyused. Other equations may be appropriate; see also ACGIHIndustrial Ventilation Manual, and Semiconductor ExhaustVentilation Guidebook.A2-5.2.1 A minimum capture velocity of 0.50 m/s (100fpm) is required at the contaminant generation point forreleases of vapor via evaporation or passive diffusion.Ventilation should not be relied upon to preventexposures to hazardous substances with releasevelocities (e.g., pressurized gases). For a plane openended duct without a flange, the air flow required at agiven capture velocity can be calculated by:Q = V(10X 2 + A)Where: Q = required exhaust air flow in m3/s (cfm)V = capture velocity in m/s (fpm) at distance X fromhoodA = hood face area in square meters (square feet)X = distance from hood face to farthest point ofcontaminant release in meters (feet). NOTE: This isonly accurate when X is within 1.5 diameters of a roundopening, or within 0.25 circumference of a squareopening.A2-5.3 Recommended Measurement/ValidationMethodA2-5.3.1 Measurement of capture velocity at farthestpoint of contaminant release. Measurements taken witha velometer or anemometer.A2-5.3.2 Confirmation by visualization check ofcapture using vapor capture testing.

Gas panelenclosures are typically of two types, those requiring noaccess while gas systems are charged, and those thatmust be opened during processing while gas systemsare charged. There is also a distinct difference incontrol specifications for those with pyrophorics orother flammables vs. other HPMs, specifically in thecontrol of pocketing.A2-6.1 Design RecommendationsA2-6.1.1 Compartmentalize potential leak points.A2-6.1.2 Minimize the total size of the panel and itsenclosure.A2-6.1.3 Minimize size and number of openings.A2-6.1.4 Minimize static pressure requirements of theenclosure; control has been shown to be achievablewith 1.3 to 2.5 mm ( 0.05 to 0.1 in.) w.g.A2-6.1.5 Design for sweep. Minimize the number andsize of openings. Seal unnecessary openings (e.g.,seams, utility holes).A2-6.1.6 Where routinely used access doors arerequired: Make the access door as small as practical. Place the openings to the enclosure in the accessdoor to minimize air flow requirements. Provide baffles behind the door to direct leaksaway from the door and openings. Compartmentalize the enclosure so that access toone area does not affect air flow control in otherareas.A2-6.2 Control SpecificationsA2-6.2.1 Exhaust volumes as low as 45 air changesper minute or less can be specified and meet the S2criteria in Section 23.5 if the design principles listedabove are considered when designing equipment andenclosures.A2-6.2.2 Where there is potential for chemicalexposure during access which can be controlled by facevelocity, the enclosure should also provide a minimumface velocity of 0.36 to 0.76 m/s (70 to 150 fpm) whenopen. Face velocity should not be relied upon to controlemissions from a pressurized fitting.A2-6.2.3 Enclosures for pyrophoric or flammablegases should be designed to ensure adequately uniform dilution (i.e., prevent pocketing) and to preventaccumulation of pyrophoric and flammable gases abovetheir lower explosive limit. Uniform dilution cangenerally be verified through exhaust vaporvisualization techniques. Ventilation flow rate shouldbe adequate to maintain concentrations below 25% ofthe lower explosive limit for the gas with the lowestLEL that is used in the enclosure. This can generally beverified using engineering calculations to verifydilution, and vapor visualization to verify mixing.A2-6.3 Recommended Measurement/ValidationMethodA2-6.3.1 Preferred validation by tracer gas testing perSEMI F15.A2-6.3.2 Additional confirmation by visualizationcheck of air flow, mixing and sweep using smoke orvapor testing.A2-6.3.3 Measurement of average face velocity atinlet(s), opening(s), or routinely used access doors.Measurements should be taken with a velometer oranemometer. For larger openings, multiplemeasurements are taken in a grid, at least 10 to 40 persquare meter (14 per square foot) of open area. Usefulequation: V = 4.043 (VP/d)0.5 , where V = velocity inm/s, VP = velocity pressure in mm H 2O, and d =density correction factor (unitless).A2-7 Equipment Exhaust VentilationSpecifications and MeasurementsA2-7.1 Specifications for equipment exhaust should beprovided by the supplier and define:A2-7.1.1 The control specification or standard for thehood or enclosure, i.e., face velocity or capture velocityif applicable.A2-7.1.2 The airflow in the duct required to maintainthe control volume or flow required. Measurementsshould be made using the ACGIH pitot traverse methoddescribed below.A2-7.1.3 The location where the Pitot traversemeasurement in the duct was made.A2-7.1.4 Static pressure requirements.A2-7.1.5 Coefficient of Entry (Ce ) (see definitions andSection 22.3).A2-7.1.6 Hood Loss Factor (K or F h) (see definitionsand Section 22.3).A2-8 Duct Traverse MethodA2-8.1 Because the air flow in the cross-section of aduct is not uniform, it is necessary to obtain an averageby measuring velocity pressure (VP) at points in anumber of equal areas in the cross-section. The usual"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 10 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S2-0703aE \xa9 SEMI 1991, 200439 method is to make two traverses across the diameter ofthe duct at right angles to each other. Reading are takenat the center of annular rings of equal area. Wheneverpossible, the traverse should be made 7.5 ductdiameters downstream and 3 diameters upstream fromobstructions or directional changes such as an elbow,hood, branch entry, etc. Where measurements are madecloser to disturbances, the results should be consideredsubject to some doubt and checked against a secondlocation. If agreement within 10% of the two traversesis obtained, reasonable accuracy can be assumed andthe average of the two readings used. Where thevariation exceeds 10%, a third location should beselected and the two air flows in the best agreementaveraged and used. The use of a single centerlinereading for obtaining average velocity is a very coarseapproximation and is not recommended. If a traversecannot be done, then the centerline duct velocity shouldbe multiplied by 0.9 for a coarse estimate of actualaverage duct velocity. Center line duct velocity shouldnot be used less than 5 duct diameters from an elbow,junction, hood opening, or other source of turbulence.A2-8.2 For ducts 150 mm (6 in.) and smaller, at least 6traverse points should be used. For round ducts largerthan 150 mm (6 in.) diameter, at least 10 traverse pointsshould be employed. For very large ducts with widevariation in velocity, 20 traverse points will increase theprecision of the air flow measurement. A2-8.3 For square or rectangular ducts, the procedureis to divide the cross-section into a number of equalrectangular areas and measure the velocity pressure atthe center of each. The number of readings should notbe less than 16. Enough readings should be made so thegreatest distance between centers is less than 150 mm(6 in.).A2-8.4 The following data are required:A2-8.4.1 The area of the duct at the traverse location.A2-8.4.2 Velocity pressure at each point in the traverseand/or average velocity and number of points measured.A2-8.4.3 Temperature of the air stream at the time andlocation of the traverse.A2-8.4.4 The velocity pressure readings obtained areconverted to velocities, and the velocities (not thevelocity pressures) are averaged. Useful equation: V =4.043 (VP/d) 0.5 , where V = velocity in m/s, VP =velocity pressure in mm H 2O, and d = densitycorrection factor (unitless).

This related information was approved for publication by vote of the responsible committee onOctober 21, 1999. R1-1 PrefaceR1-1.1 Compliance with design-based safety standardsdoes not necessarily ensure adequate safety in complexor state-of-the-art systems. It is often necessary toperform hazard analyses to identify hazards that arespecific to the system, and develop hazard controlmeasures that adequately control the associated riskbeyond those that are covered in existing design-basedstandards. This document provides guidelines fordeveloping a deliberate, planned equipment/productsafety (EPS) program integrating the complianceassessment activities with hazard analyses and otheractivities needed to provide a safe system throughoutthe life of equipment or products.R1-1.2 An effective EPS program reduces the cost,schedule slips, and liability associated with the lateidentification and correction of hazards. To be mosteffective, an EPS program should be begun by themanufacturer early during the design phase. Startingearly allows safety to be designed into the system andits subsystems, equipment, facilities, processes,procedures, and their interfaces and operations. Theseguidelines are designed to assist the manufacturer inplanning and implementation of an effective EPSprogram.R1-1.3 The lowest costs for implementing safety canbe achieved when hazards are identified and resolvedbefore hardware is built and firmware or software iscoded. This guide is intended to provide the basis for amethodology for implementing a safety program forearly and continued hazard identification and theelimination or reduction of associated risks.R1-1.4 EPS program success depends directly uponmanagement emphasis and support applied during thesystem design and development process and throughoutthe life cycle of the product. This emphasis shouldinclude the following management controls:R1-1.4.1 Agreement from management that the EPSprogram will be maintained and supported throughoutthe product or facility life cycle;R1-1.4.2 Clear and early statements of agreement withEPS objectives and requirements;R1-1.4.3 Understanding of, and participation in, therisk acceptance process; and R1-1.4.4 Continuing consideration of risk reductionduring the management review process. R1-2 PurposeR1-2.1 This guide describes an approach fordeveloping and implementing an EPS program ofsufficient comprehensiveness to identify the hazards ofa product and to develop design and administrativecontrols to prevent incidents. The EPS programaddresses hazards from many sources to include systemdesign, hazardous materials, advancing technologies,and new techniques. The goal is to eliminate hazards orreduce the associated risk to an acceptable level.

R1-4 General GuidelinesR1-4.1 EPS Program  The supplier should establishand maintain an EPS program to support efficient andeffective achievement of overall EPS objectives.Depending upon the needs of the company, the EPSProgram may be a company wide program covering allprojects, separate programs for each project, or somecombination of the two.R1-4.1.1 Management System  The supplier shouldestablish an EPS management system to implementprovisions of this guide commensurate with the needsof the program. The program manager should beresponsible for the establishment, control, incorpor-ation, direction and implementation of the EPS programpolicies and should assure that risk is identified andeliminated or controlled. The supplier should establishinternal reporting systems and procedures forinvestigation and disposition of product relatedincidents and safety incidents, including potentiallyhazardous conditions not yet involved in an incident.R1-4.2 EPS Design GuidelinesR1-4.2.1 EPS design requirements should be specifiedafter review of pertinent standards, specifications,regulations, design handbooks, safety design checklists,"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 22 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S2-0703aE \xa9 SEMI 1991, 200451 and other sources of design guidance for applicability tothe design of the system. The supplier should establishEPS design criteria derived from applicable dataincluding the preliminary hazard analyses. Thesecriteria should be the basis for developing systemspecification EPS requirements. The supplier shouldcontinue to expand the criteria and requirements forinclusion in development specification during thesubsequent program phases. R1-5 Detailed GuidelinesR1-5.1 The purpose of the EPS program is to ensurethat the equipment or product is designed anddocumented in a manner that reduces the safety riskassociated with that equipment or product to a level thatis acceptable to the customer. This considerationapplies to all life cycle phases of the equipment orproduct. The following sections include detailedelements of a formal EPS program. Management shouldselect or tailor the elements appropriate to their needs.R1-5.2 EPS Program Plan (EPSPP)  The purpose ofa EPS Program Plan (EPSPP) is to describe the tasksand activities of EPS management and engineeringrequired to identify, evaluate, and eliminate/controlhazards, or reduce the associated risk to an acceptablelevel throughout the system life cycle.

R5-2.2 Assumptions Used for Above DerivationR5-2.2.1 Because typical semiconductor equipment is considered rigid, a frequency response analysis was notconsidered to be necessary.R5-2.2.2 Seismic waves typically have vertical as well as horizontal components associated with them; however,these components typically arrive out of phase (i.e., they do not reach maximum values simultaneously). Thevertical component serves to, in effect, reduce the amount of equipment mass that is available to resist overturningor toppling. The task force chose to take this into account by limiting the calculated weight available to resistoverturning to 85% of the weight of the equipment. An alternate method, not chosen by the task force, could havebeen to simultaneously apply a vertical (Z) force.

R7-1 International Background InformationR7-1.1 The International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA)Mailing address:P.O. Box 100Wagramerstrasse 5A-1400, Vienna, AustriaTelephone: (+43-1) 2060-0; Facsimile: (+43-1) 20607:E-mail: ",(0,o.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"mailto:Official.Mail@iaea.orgR7-1.2"},"Official.Mail@iaea.orgR7-1.2")," Basic approaches to radiation protection areconsistent all over the world. The InternationalCommission on Radiation Protection (ICRP)recommends that any exposure above the naturalbackground radiation should be kept as low asreasonably achievable, but below the individual doselimits. The total individual dose limit for radiationworkers over 5 years is 100 mSv, and for members ofthe general public, is 1 mSv per year. These dose limitshave been established based on a prudent approach byassuming that there is no threshold dose below whichthere would be no effect. This hypothesis proposes thatany additional dose will cause a proportional increase inthe chance of a health effect. This relationship has notyet been established in the low dose range where thedose limits have been set.R7-1.3 The ICRP and the IAEA recommend theindividual dose must be kept as low as reasonablyachievable and consideration must be given to thepresence of other sources that may cause simultaneousradiation exposure to the same group of the public.Also, allowance for future sources or practices must bekept in mind so that the total dose received by anindividual member of the public does not exceed thedose limit. R7-2 How Does This Apply to theSemiconductor Industry?R7-2.1 A person who can potentially be exposed toionizing radiation during the normal course of businessin excess of the annual limit for the general publicshould be considered a radiation worker. A radiationworker is trained to recognize and protect him orherself from the hazards of ionizing radiation. They may require exposure monitoring to determinecompliance with local radiation regulations. Radiationworkers are covered by a radiation safety program. Aradiation safety program is an administrative control.Engineering controls minimize the need for spendingresources in a large scale radiation program.R7-2.2 The exposure limit for the radiation worker is20 millisievert (2000 millirem) per year. Based on a 40hour/week, 50 week/working year basis, the allowableionizing radiation emissions are 10 microsieverts/hr(1.0 millirem/hr). This exposure rate should beevaluated as an emission rate from any accessiblesurface of the equipment (the closest approach to thesurface that the radiation is penetrating).R7-2.3 Maintenance technicians for radiation machinesshould be participants in the radiation safety program asradiation workers. The equipment should be designed toallow maintenance technicians access to areas that donot exceed 10 microsieverts/hr.R7-2.4 Service technicians for radiation machinesshould be participants in their employers radiationsafety program as radiation workers. The equipmentshould be designed to allow service technicians accessto areas that exceed the 10 microsievert per hour levelwhen operating, but not while the radiation is present.R7-2.5 The person operating radiation producingequipment (Operator) should not be considered aradiation worker. The emission limit for the operatoraccessible areas is recommended to be 20% of theoccupational limit. The maximum allowable ionizingradiation emissions for operator accessible areas isrecommended to be 2 microsieverts/hr (0.2millirem/hr). This exposure rate should be evaluated asan emission rate from any surface foreseeablyaccessible by an operator of the equipment, and shouldbe measured as an instantaneous rate. R7-3 DefinitionsR7-3.1 accessible  a significant part of the wholebody, head, or eyes.R7-3.2 bremsstrahlung  is radiation produced byslowing of charged particles. The term means brakingradiation."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 38 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S2-0703aE \xa9 SEMI 1991, 200467 NOTE 1: During design of shielding, the properties of theradiation should be considered as well as the properties of theshielding materials. Bremsstrahlung production should beminimized. Some shielding materials are consideredhazardous materials. These hazardous properties should beconsidered and identified.R7-3.3 radiation machine  means any devicecapable of producing ionizing radiation except thosedevices with radioactive material as the only source ofradiation.R7-3.4 radiation producing machine  is a radiationmachine that produces ionizing radiation as a by-product of the process it uses, e.g., ion implanter orscanning electron microscope.R7-3.5 radiation worker  worker means anindividual engaged in radiation related work under alicense or certificate of registration issued by theAgency and controlled by a licensee or registrant, butdoes not include the licensee or registrant.R7-3.6 radioactive material  means any material(solid, liquid, or gas) that emits ionizing radiationspontaneously.R7-3.7 X-ray machine  is a radiation machine thatgenerates X-rays as a primary function of theequipment. This category of radiation machine has aspecific limit due to the existence of performancestandards against which the equipment is evaluated.The equipment must be below this limit to be sold insome parts of the world. R7-3.8 X-rays  are produced with electricity andtherefore can be turned off. X-rays seem to be the mostprevalent radiation type in semiconductormanufacturing equipment. They are produced whencharged particles are slowed or stopped. This slowingresults in bremsstrahlung. The majority of theequipment does not intentionally produce X-rays. Thisenergy is a by-product of the process. R7-4 Radioactive MaterialsR7-4.1 Gamma radiation is a by-product of atomictransformations (decay) and is a release of energy fromthe nucleus. This radiation energy must be shieldedsince there is no off switch.R7-4.2 Radioactive Materials are controlled bylicensing. There are quantities of certain radioactivematerials that are exempt from regulation. Thesesources should be identified.R7-4.3 External radiation hazards from radioactivematerials include gamma rays. These are controlled andevaluated much like the X-rays.R7-4.4 Internal radiation hazards from radioactivematerials include Alpha and Beta particles. Radioactivematerials ingested or inhaled can be metabolized ordamage surrounding tissue. Allowable levels ofairborne radioactivity and radionuclide intakes arespecified in regulations. The objective is still tomaintain all exposure to ionizing radiation (internal andexternal) as low as reasonably achievable, but alwaysless than the allowable regulatory limits."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 39 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S2-0703aE \xa9 SEMI 1991, 2004 68 RELATED INFORMATION 8DOCUMENTATION OF NON-IONIZING RADIATION (SECTION 25 ANDAPPENDIX 5) INCLUDING RATIONALE FOR CHANGES NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI S2 and was derived from practical application bytask force members. This related information was approved for publication by vote of the responsible committee onOctober 21, 1999.R8-1 The user of this table is responsible for obtainingthe current revision of the standards cited forOccupational Exposure Limits (OEL).R8-2 The emission values in Appendix 5 that are not tobe exceeded were chosen based on a review of allknown international standards as well as aconsideration for best available control technology (i.e.,lowest values currently achievable for each radiationtype). Where a general public limit existed, 20% of thisvalue was selected. Where there was no public limit,the value selected is generally 20% of the OEL value(instantaneous field strength measurement peak). Thelatter case would have the occupational and generalpublic levels the same. Where there was anoccupational exposure limit specified in a standard, themaintenance emission limit was set at 20% of this level.R8-3 Most health standards differentiate betweenoccupational and general public exposure criteria.IEEE C95.1 differentiates between controlled accessand uncontrolled access exposures. According toC95.1 controlled access environments are thosewhere locations where there is exposure that may beincurred by persons who are aware of the potential forexposure as a concomitant of employment, by othercognizant persons, or as the incidental result oftransient passage through areas where analysis showsthe exposure levels may be above those shown in Table2 but do not exceed those of Table 1, and where theinduced currents may exceed the values in Table 2, PartB, but do not exceed the values of Table 1, Part B.According to C95.1, uncontrolled accessenvironments are locations where there is the exposureof individuals who have no knowledge or control oftheir exposure. The exposure may occur in livingquarters or workplaces where there are no expectationsthat the exposure levels may exceed those shown inTable 2 and where induced currents do not exceed thosein Table 2, Part B. Task force members advise that C95.1 controlled access and other occupationalexposure standards should be applied to personnelperforming maintenance and service of equipment andthat uncontrolled access or other general publicstandards should be applied to equipment operatorsduring routine work and to other locations. These IEEEdefinitions are particularly relevant to broadcastfacilities as well as normal industrial environments suchas fabs. Task force members recommend thatuncontrolled access limits be applied to fetal exposure.R8-4 As with the rationale in the Ionizing section, theoperator is considered a member of the general publicor to be in an uncontrolled area. Maintenance or servicetechnicians should be trained to know how to controlthe hazardous energy and protect themselves from thehazard and its adverse effects.R8-5 References1. 1996 TLVs and BEIs Threshold Limit Values forChemical Substances and Physical Agents BiologicalExposure Indices, ACGIH, Cincinnati, OH2.

This related information was approved for publication by vote of the responsible committee onOctober 21, 1999.The following is some of the research leading to thevalues in Table 1 in Section 18 of this guideline.R13-1 The proposed Hazardous Temperature Limitswere derived from UL195012 and IEC95013 by addingambient temperature (25\xb0C) to the maximumtemperature rise allowed for external parts ofinformation technology equipment. Because severalSEMI members have questioned whether these limitsmight subject operators and maintenance personnel tocontact with potentially hazardous temperatures, areview has been done of several other sources ofsuggested temperature limits.R13-2 The proposed hazardous surface temperaturesfor handling and touching of metal handles, knobs, etc.,for brief periods in normal use is 60\xb0C. Assuming abrief handling time to be 5 seconds or less, this limit issupported in MIL-STD-147214, MIL-HDBK-759A 15and EN56316 (which are the same or more conservativeby 2\xb0C), and is equal to the pain and tissue damagethreshold listed in the Human Factors DesignHandbook17 . Thus, this temperature limit seemsappropriate for momentary (five seconds or less)contact with uncoated metal handles, knobs, etc., andother material with high thermal conductivity.R13-3 The proposed hazardous surface temperaturesfor handling and touching of glass/porcelain handles,knobs, etc., for brief periods in normal use is 70\xb0C.This temperature limit is supported by MIL-STD-1472and EN563. MIL-HDBK-759 is not applicable becauseit must be assumed that it applies only to material withhigh thermal conductivity.R13-4 The proposed hazardous surface temperatures forhandling and touching of plastic/rubber handles, knobs,etc., for brief periods in normal use is 85\xb0C. This 12 UL 1950, Safety of Information Technology Equipment, 1989(Underwriters Laboratory Standard).13 IEC 950, Safety of Information Technology Equipment, 1986(International Electrotechnical Commission Standard).14 MIL-STD-1472D, Human Engineering Design Criteria forMilitary Systems, Equipment & Facilities (Military Standard).15 MIL-HDBK-759A, Handbook for Human Engineering DesignGuidelines, 1981 (Military Handbook).16 EN 563, Safety of Machinery  Temperatures of TouchableSurfaces, 1994 (European Normative Standard).17 Human Factors Design Handbook, Second Edition, Woodson,Tillman & Tillman, 1992 (Reference). temperature limit is similarly supported by MIL-STD-1472 and EN563. MIL-HDBK-759 is not applicable.R13-5 The proposed hazardous surface temperaturesfor continuous handling and touching of metal handles,knobs, etc., during normal usage is 55\xb0C. It issuggested, based on observations of semiconductorequipment in use, that a continuous handling time ofone minute be used. With this duration, the limit of theMIL-STD and the MIL-HDBK ranges from 49 to 52\xb0C.The EN563 burn threshold limit for contact with metalfor one minute is 51\xb0C. The burning heat pain levellisted in the Human Factors Design Handbook is 49\xb0C(no time frame given; assume high thermal conductivitymaterial). Thus, the proposed temperature limit appearsto be somewhat high for reasonably foreseeableextended handling contact with uncoated metal handles,knobs, etc., and other material with high thermalconductivity. The Section 18 Table 1 limit is 51\xb0C,which might be somewhat painful to more sensitivepersonnel, but should not result in tissue damage.R13-6 The proposed hazardous surface temperaturesfor extended handling and touching of glass/porcelainhandles, knobs, etc., during normal usage (againassuming 1 minute) is 65\xb0C. The limit of MIL-STD-1472D is 59\xb0C for prolonged contact with glass. TheEN563 burn threshold limit at 1 minute is 56\xb0C. Thus,the proposed temperature limit appears to be slightlyhigh for reasonably foreseeable extended handlingcontact with glass/porcelain surfaces of moderatethermal conductivity. The Section 18 Table 1 limit is56\xb0C, which is the more conservative of therecommendations. This limit could be raised basedupon the results of the risk assessment for actual andforeseeable normal usage.R13-7 Similarly, the proposed hazardous surfacetemperatures for extended handling and touching ofplastic/rubber handles, knobs, etc., during normal usage(again assuming 1 minute) is 75\xb0C. The limit of MIL-STD-1472D is 69\xb0C for prolonged contact withplastic. The EN563 burn threshold limit at 1 minute is60\xb0C. Thus, the proposed temperature limit againappears to be slightly high for reasonably foreseeableextended handling contact with plastic/rubber surfacesof low thermal conductivity. The Section 18 Table 1limit is 60\xb0C, which is the more conservative of therecommendations. This limit could be raised based"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 48 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S2-0703aE \xa9 SEMI 1991, 200477 upon the results of the risk assessment for actual andforeseeable normal usage.R13-8 The proposed hazardous surface temperaturesfor external surfaces and internal parts which may betouched are 70\xb0C for metal, 80\xb0C for glass/porcelain,and 95\xb0C for plastic/rubber. It is assumed that this limitapplies to inadvertent touching by theoperator/maintenance person, resulting in the personinstantly breaking contact with the hot surface. Thereare no analogs in either the MIL-STD or the MIL-HDBK for these temperature limits. The EN563 burnthreshold range for one-second contact with uncoatedmetal is 65 to 70\xb0C, while the range for one-secondcontact with glass is 80 to 86\xb0C. The proposedtemperature limit appears to be slightly high forreasonably foreseeable inadvertent contact withexternal metal surfaces. The Section 18 Table 1 limitfor contact with external metal surfaces is 65\xb0C, whichis the conservative end of the EN563 range.R13-9 No information was available to support orrefute the temperature limits for contact with externalplastic/rubber surfaces. With regard to internal parts,the proposed temperature limits may be adequate giventhe foreseeable cooling which would likely occur priorto handling of internal parts. The actual thermal lag ofcomponents likely to be handled could be verified bythermocouple readings on specific equipment during arisk assessment.
