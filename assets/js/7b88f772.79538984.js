The following subsections describe apart of these specifications for introduction. Refer tothese documents for detail reference.6.2 SOAP Structure  A HTTP message in thisspecification has an envelope to contain a couple ofMIME blocks. One is for SOAP Envelope and the otheris for message detail to be able to mix with such non-XML information as binary data. The service messagespecified in Specification for Tracking Jigs andImplements is contained in latter one. SOAP standardenvelop MIME Block contains SOAP Header whichhas message information and SOAP Body whichcontains SOAP Faults. Outlined diagram is shown inRelated Information. Official definitions are given inreferenced documents.6.3 Messaging Mechanism  Message Broker, that islogical middle ware server to handle and relaymessages, is assumed somewhere on communicationnetwork. While the broker behaves as communicationserver, the other logical nodes are message clients.Every message starts with a client and responded by theserver. Messages communicated between clients areexchanged through the server. The server keeps postedmessages from clients in a queue for each individualclient. Expecting recipient client asks the server formessages and a topmost message in the queue for theclient is responded if the queue is not empty. Therecipient client posts acknowledge back to the server.When the recipient replies back a message to theoriginal sender client, same thing happens withswitched roles between sender and recipient clients.Explanatory diagrams for this outline are shown inRelated Information. Official specification is given inreferenced documents.6.4 Issues Specific to this Messaging  A few issuesfor IPC based communication protocol for Jigs andImplements Tracking are introduced here. 6.4.1 Domain Configuration  Message Broker hasdomain configuration information to make sure allacting entities, possible messages with relatedpublisher, recipient and subscriber clients. Also it hasother detail characteristics of the domain ofcommunication. Every client needs to look up theinformation before the first messaging.6.4.2 Message Information  This is an elementcontained in SOAP Header. This information providestime of transaction, sender, destination, messageidentification and schema type used for service messagedetail in the second MIME block.6.4.3 Attributes in Service Message Element  Thetop element of each service message has date/time ofthe message, session ID or session reference, request IDor request reference, and optional values. Some of theoptional values are extended for Jigs and ImplementsTracking communication: linkId, linkCnt and linkExp.The extension may be used for delayed reply messageand multiple divided replies to keep conformance ofrelated messages. 7 Requirements7.1 Service Mapping  Services defined inSpecification for Tracking Jigs and Implement aremapped on the following table.7.1.1 Capitalized Service Message Element Name Base Each service message is mapped into an XMLelement with capitalized heading letter to preventcollision with XML or XML Schema native words.7.1.2 Service Message Element Name Suffix Because of symmetry of message brokercommunication and for XML element namingconvention, suffix of Request or Response is addedto each service message element name for request orresponse respectively: e.g. AddEventRequest to requestservice and AddEventResponse for its responsemessage.Table 1 Service Instruction MappingService Message Name Supporting Class Service Message ElementName BaseRemarks addEvent HistoryRecord AddEventadopt HistoryDB AdoptchangeAction Expiry ChangeActionchangeDescription Expiry ChangeDescriptionchangeExpiration Expiry ChangeExpirationchangeName Attachment, PublicLocation, Secondment ChangeNamechangeNamespace Inventory ChangeNamespacedestrcut Exception, Expiry, HistoryBuffer,HistoryRecord, SecondmentDestrcut disown HistoryDB Disown"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 24 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI T12.2-0704 \xa9 SEMI 20043 Service Message Name Supporting Class Service Message ElementName BaseRemarks fluctuate HistoryRecord Fluctuateinstall Inventory InstalllistEvent HistoryRecord ListEventlistRecords HistoryDB ListRecordslistUp Inventory ListUpreceiveInvoice JitMachine ReceiveInvoicereset HistoryDB ResetsetReleaseCondition HistoryBuffer SetReleaseConditionshowAction Expiry ShowActionshowAttachment HistoryBuffer ShowAttachmentshowAttachments Invoice, JitMachine, PublicLocation ShowAttachmentsshowAvailableSpace PublicLocation ShowAvailableSpaceshowCapacity PublicLocation ShowCapacityshowCategory Exception ShowCategoryshowCode Exception ShowCodeshowData Inventory ShowDatashowDescription Exception, Expiry ShowDescriptionshowEvent HistoryRecord ShowEventshowExeptions JitMachine ShowExeptionsshowExpiration Expiry ShowExpirationshowHistory Attachment, HistoryBuffer, HistoryDB,HistoryRecord, InvoiceShowHistory showId Attachment, Exception, Expiry, Invoice,JitMachine, PublicLocation, SecondmentShowId showLoadports Invoice ShowLoadportsshowLocationType PublicLocation ShowLocationTypeshowName Attachment, JitMachine, PublicLocation,SecondmentShowName showNamespace Inventory ShowNamespaceshowOccupancy PublicLocation ShowOccupancyshowPossibleType PublicLocation ShowPossibleTypeshowReleaseCondition HistoryBuffer ShowReleaseConditionshowState Exception, Expiry, HistoryBuffer,PublicLocation, SecondmentShowState showSubject Exception, Expiry ShowSubjectshowType Attachment, JitMachine, Secondment ShowTypeshowTypes Invoice ShowTypesuninstall Inventory Uninstallupdate HistoryDB, Inventory UpdateupdateHistory Attachment, Exception, HistoryBuffer UpdateHistoryupdateState PublicLocation UpdateState"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 25 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI T12.2-0704 \xa9 SEMI 2004 4 7.2 Service Parameter Mapping  Service parameter type mapping is shown in the following table.Table 2 Service Parameter Type MappingParameter Name Attribute/Element Type RemarksAction Element stringAttachmentId Element stringAttachmentInfo Element stringAttachmentName Element stringAttachmentType Element anyType Some EnumerationCapacity Element unsignedIntCategory Element stringCode Element stringCondition Element stringDataName Element stringDataValue Element anyType Usually integer or floatDescription Element stringEventCaption Element anyType Formatted TextExceptionId Element stringExpiration Element stringExpiryId Element stringGroupName Element stringHandle Element stringHistory Element anyType Formatted TextHistoryDifference Element anyType Formatted TextInvoiceId Element stringItem Element string maybe enumeratedLoadportId Element string Usually small integerLocation Element stringLocationId Element stringLocationName Element stringLocationType Element stringMachineId Element stringMachineName Element stringMachineType Element stringOperation Element string EnumeratedOccupancy Element int Positive or NagativeRestriction Element string regular expression or anyServiceStatus Element complexType status+RejectionSpace Element unsignedInt Usually small integerState Element string Class dependent"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 26 --",">"),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"SEMI T12.2-0704 \xa9 SEMI 20045 7.3 Additional Parameters for Service Messages  Because this protocol mapping works for asynchronous HTTPserver-client communication on message broker, such additional parameters to give complementary information asissued time and transaction identification are required to be attached to each message.
