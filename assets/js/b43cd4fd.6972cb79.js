If the sample fiducial mark is not an X axis mark, the intended value must be indicated on the sample (seeFigure A1-1).

Determination of the suitability of the material is solely theresponsibility of the user. R1-1  PresentationR1-1.1 It is common practice to plot BRDF with respect to the angle from the specular beam, . If scatter ismeasured only in the PLIN,  = s i. However, in the more general case for scatter out of the PLIN: ( )ssisi cossinsincoscoscos 1 +=  (R1-1) R1-1.2 This is a useful angular reference for specular samples. However, when using this format, care must betaken that  is not confused withs in the calculation of BRDF. This presentation format is normally used onlywhen  passes through zero, that is, when the scatter scan includes the specular beam.R1-1.3 The terms forward scatter and back scatter refer to PLIN scatter directions for which  is respectivelypositive or negative. Note that  continues to increase as a negative angle when passing the surface normal sincethe sign ofs switches in the above equation. R1-2  PresentationR1-2.1  =  o, where = sins ando = sini, is a method of expressing the angle between the specular andscatter directions in direction cosine space along the surface for scatter in the PLIN. This is a very usefulnormalization when scatter results only from surface microroughness, and the grating equation:fnis \xb1= sinsin (R1-2) where: = wavelength of the incident flux,f = linear spatial frequency for the microroughness in the x or y direction, andn = diffraction order.This equation can be used to relates to the frequency, f. Only the first order (n = 1) is significant for roughnessmuch less than the wavelength. BRDF can now be interpreted as the ability of each frequency to scatter light. IfBRDF is plotted against a  scale it may be independent ofi and proportional to f. If the surface behaves in thisway the BRDF is shift invariant.11 R1-2.2 In the general case for scatter out of the PLIN the following two dimensional grating equations apply: xiss fn \xb1= sinsincos (R1-3) and yss fn \xb1=sinsin (R1-4) The definition of  must be expanded to include the projection of the scattered light in the X and Y directions: ssisi cossinsin2sinsin 222 += (R1-5 ) 11 Harvey, James E., Light Scattering Characteristics of Optical Surfaces, Proceedings SPIE 107, 41 (1977)"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 4 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI ME1392-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 200513 R1-3 Reflectance FactorR1-3.1 A measure of diffuse reflectance in common use is the reflectance factor, R, that is the ratio of fluxpropagated from source to receiver in a reflectometer with a specimen, to the flux propagated with a perfectlyreflecting diffuser.

Determination of the suitability of the material is solely theresponsibility of the user. R2-1 Total Integrated Scatter (TIS)R2-1.1 TIS can be calculated from BRDF by integrating BRDF over the hemisphere.12 Typically a 5\xb0 total anglehole is left around the specular beam since specular light is not included in total integrated scatter (see SEMIMF1048).R2-1.1.1 For an isotropic surface, measure in-plane BRDF ati = 0 and calculate the expected total integratedscatter by integrating over the angle limits specified in SEMI MF1048. \xb0 \xb0=70 5.21calculated dsinBRDFcos2TIS sssR (R2-1) R2-1.1.2 Sample specular reflectance, R, must be included because total integrated scatter is referenced to reflectedand not incident power. The coss term must be included because BRDF is defined in terms of the projectedreceiver aperture. This comparison between total integrated scatter and BRDF may not be exact since the totalintegrated scatter detector is less sensitive to light incident on the detector at large angles and if low f (close tospecular) scatter dominates, the 5\xb0 hole size is critical. In addition a TIS instrument is not polarization selective. R2-2 RoughnessR2-2.1 The rms surface roughness,, is an often quoted number that can be obtained from direct profilemeasurements with stylus or optical profilometers. It can also be inferred from total integrated scatter when, ","<","<","/4 for front surface scatter from a clean, smooth surface,13 as described in SEMI MF1048. ( ) 2/1TIS4 = (R2-2) R2-2.1.1 The user must confirm the usefulness of this calculation based on the particular measurementcircumstances. It may have strong frequency limitations and not agree with surface roughness derived from opticalor mechanical profile instruments (which can have different spatial frequency limits14). R2-3 Power SpectrumR2-3.1 The surface power spectral density function (PSD) can be calculated from the BRDF through a scattermodel. For example, the grating equation model discussed in R1-2 shows that high frequency surfaceperturbations scatter light far from specular and low frequency perturbations scatter close to specular. The PSDshows the amount of modulation versus f , that is, the square of the Fourier transform of the surface profile. Since itis a sample property, the same PSD should be obtained regardless of wavelength and incident angle dependentdifferences in the BRDF data.R2-3.2 Wavelength scaling is another check on system calibration. Smooth, clean, nonabsorbing front surfacereflectors should yield the same PSD for different BRDF measurement wavelengths. If the instrument does notwavelength scale on appropriate samples, the BRDF measurement may be suspect.

It was developed during the original approval of this standard by ASTM CommitteeE12 in 1996. SEMI approval was by full letter ballot procedures with publication authorized by the NA RegionalStandards Committee on December 10, 2004. Determination of the suitability of the material is solely theresponsibility of the user. R3-1 There is a considerable amount of information that should accompany BRDF measurements. This suggesteddata file format (see Table R3-1) divides the information into descriptive headers followed by a data sequence ofvariables. The headers consist of laboratory information, system information, sample information and measurementparameters. These are simply generic labels that help to organize the fields under the headers. Any of the headerfields can be a variable in the data sequence; however, variables are normally limited to measurement parameters. R3-2 The data files are stored as ASCII text fields. Each set of data taken is stored as a separate data file. Eachfield in the headers and each data point in the data sequence begins on a new line (carriage returnline feed pairterminates each line). Multiple items under each field in the headers and multiple variables per data point field inthe data sequence are separated by commas. Each field in the headers has a unique one word name preceding thefield contents on the same line. This name identifies the contents of the field. The first character of a name must bean alpha character. R3-3 The data sequence must come at the end of the file. Each line in the data sequence represents a single datapoint. It must begin with a numeric character, the + character or the  character. Multiple variables for eachdata point are on the same line but separated by commas. This permits the data sequence to be printed as a set ofcolumns. Each variable must remain in the same column throughout a file. The VARS field specifies whichvariable is in each column. R3-4 Because of the name tag, there is no position dependence for information in the headers. The number ofheader fields can vary from one data file to another. If a certain field is not in the file it means that information wasnot recorded or does not apply to that measurement. Every user should supply a format template for their headerand data sequence in order to expedite conversion from site to site and avoid confusion over units and field size.Fields can easily be added to the headers if sufficient descriptive text is provided in the field or on the template.Fields can be added or deleted from old data sets without obsoleting the data file. This is a suggested list of fields ina recommended grouping and order. Additional fields can be defined by users, and they can be added to this guideas they become accepted by the scatter community.Table R3-1 Suggested Data FormatLABORATORY INFORMATIONLAB","_","NAME text

Thus, as shown in Figure 1, the diffracted beam of X rayspossesses maximum intensity when the angle of incidence,, of the beam with the reflecting planes, the X-raywave-length,, the atomic interplanar spacing, d, and the order of the diffraction, n, simultaneously have values thatobey Braggs law as follows: sin2dn = (1) NOTE: Reflection conditions are as follows: NB = BM = dsin, NB + BM = n, n = 2dsin.Figure 1Geometrical Reflection Conditions for X Rays from a Single Crystal 4.1.1.1 The reflecting planes are more commonly defined in terms of their Miller indexes (h, k, l). The Millerindexes are the smallest integers proportional to the reciprocals of the intercepts of the plane on the three crystalaxes of unit length. Thus, for any lattice structure where the periodicity is represented by a cubic unit cell of sidelength (lattice parameter), a, the lattice spacing, d, of a set of parallel atomic planes, may be written as follows: 3 Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol 14.02.4 American National Standards Institute, New York Office: 25 West 43rd Street, New York, NY 10036, USA.

Metals 4, 1044 (1952).#4 Giesecke, G., and Pfister, H., Acta Crystallographica 11, 369 (1958). 4.1.2 The orientation of a single crystal surface is the crystallographic plane, described in terms of its Millerindices, with which the surface is ideally coincident. In semiconductive single crystals, where the cross-sectionalplane of the crystal or the surface of a wafer cut from the crystal usually corresponds within several degrees to a lowindex crystallographic plane, such as a (100) or (111) plane, the orientation is frequently described in terms of themaximum angular deviation of the low index crystallographic plane from the mechanically prepared surface. Othercrystallographic planes may be found with respect to this low index plane by using a table of angles betweencrystallographic planes of a cubic crystal. Such a table appears in ASTM Test Method E 82.4.1.3 The angular deviation of a reflecting plane from a prepared reference surface is found by determining twocomponents of the deviation in two planes perpendicular to each other and to the reference surface. Each of thedeviation components represents a setting of the crystal lattice that satisfies Bragg's law for the particular X-raybeam configuration. The reference surface itself must be perpendicular to the plane of the incident and reflectedbeams. Initially, an orientation determination is made at any arbitrary position of the crystal. Then the crystal isrotated 90\xb0 of arc about the normal to the reference surface (the normal lying in the plane of the incident andreflected beams) and a second orientation determination made. The crystal is rotated another 90\xb0 of arc (in the samedirection) and a third orientation determination is made. The crystal has now been rotated 180\xb0 of arc with respectto the starting point. The crystal is then rotated another 90\xb0 of arc (that is, 270\xb0 of arc from the starting point) and afourth orientation determination is made.4.1.4 These four measurements are combined to determine both the instrument error and the two components of theangular deviation, and, between the reference surface under investigation and the desired crystallographic plane.This information facilitates slicing of the crystal along the desired plane or alternatively the determination of themaximum angular deviation."),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 14 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF26-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2005 4 4.2 Apparatus4.2.1 X-Ray Apparatus, commercially available, utilizing a copper-target tube, gives satisfactory results. The X-raybeam is collimated by means of a slit system to give parallel rays, and the X rays are passed through a thin nickelfilter to give a beam that is essentially monochromatic. The specimen is placed in a holder so that the surface underinvestigation contains the axis about which the specimen is rotated in satisfying the Bragg law conditions. Rotationsabout this axis are measured on a scale in degrees and minutes of arc. The holder must also permit rotation of thespecimen about a normal to the surface under investigation. The Bragg angle corresponding to the particular X-raywavelength used, the material under investigation, and the particular family of planes being oriented must be knownfrom Table 1 or be determined. A suitable detector, such as a Geiger counter, is positioned so that the anglebetween the extension of the incident X-ray beam and the line joining the counter and the axis of rotation of thespecimen is twice the Bragg angle. It is essential that the incident X-ray beam, the diffracted beam, the referencesurface normal, and the detector opening all lie in the same plane.4.3 Hazards4.3.1 Too much emphasis cannot be placed on the necessity of avoiding personal exposure to X rays. It isespecially important to keep hands or fingers out of the path of the X rays and to protect the eyes from scatteredsecondary radiation.

These pits are bounded by planes related to the principalcrystallographic directions of the material. These limiting boundary planes determine the shape of the pits when theetched surface is near a major crystallographic direction. An optical examination of the facets comprising the pitwalls relates the crystal surface under examination to this crystallographic direction, and further permits adetermination of the degree of misorientation of the surface from the crystallographic plane.5.1.2 A light beam that is reflected from such a preferentially etched surface may be focused upon a screen to forma definite geometric pattern characteristic of the surface etch pit structure. Patterns, such as those reproduced inFigure 2, reflected from surfaces approximately parallel to (111)-, (100)-, and (110)-type planes are recognizable. Ineach instance, the central portion of the pattern observed on the screen is the reflection from the bottom of the etchpit. These bottom facets represent planes parallel to the characteristic crystallographic plane of the surface underinvestigation. Therefore, when the central reflected beam is aligned with the direction of the light beam, thiscrystallographic plane is perpendicular to the light beam direction. This observation permits orientation of thecrystal along a desired crystallographic axis or, alternatively, allows the determination of the degree ofmisorientation of a crystal surface from a desired crystallographic plane.5.2 Reagents and Materials5.2.1 Purity of Water  Reference to water shall be understood to mean Type E-3 or better water as described inASTM Guide D 5127.5.2.2 Germanium Etchant Solution  Mix 1 part HF, 1 part H 2O2, and 4 parts water, by volume.5.2.3 Hydrofluoric Acid (HF), 49%, in accordance with Grade 1 of SEMI C28.5.2.4 Hydrogen Peroxide (H 2O 2), 30%, in accordance with Grade 1 of SEMI C30.5.2.5 Potassium Hydroxide Solution (KOH), 45% by weight in water, in accordance with Grade 1 of SEMI C40.5.2.6 Sodium Hydroxide Solution (NaOH), 50% by weight in water, in accordance with Grade 1 of SEMI C43.5.3 Apparatus5.3.1 Light Beam  originating preferably from a high-intensity point source.

Last previous edition SEMI MF43-99. 1 Purpose1.1 The resistivity of a semiconductor material is an important materials acceptance requirement. Resistivitydeterminations made during device fabrication are also widely used for quality control purposes.1.2 These test methods cover two procedures which are widely used for making routine measurements. 2 Scope2.1 The two test methods in this standard are as follows:2.1.1 Method A, Two-Probe  This test method requires a bar specimen of measurable cross section and withcross-sectional dimensions small in comparison with the length of the bar. For materials for which no specificreferee method has been developed, this test method is recommended for materials acceptance purposes.2.1.2 Method B, Four-Probe  This test method is rapid and does not require a specimen of regular cross section.This test method may be used on irregularly shaped specimens, provided a flat region is available for the contactingprobes. As described in this standard, this test method is applicable only to specimens such that the thickness of thespecimen and the distance from any probe point to the nearest edge are both at least four times the probe spacing.For the special case of specimens of circular cross section with thickness more than one, but less than four, times theprobe spacing, measurements by this test method are possible; the required application of approximate geometriccorrections results in improved accuracy (see 10.1.3).2.2 In general, resistivity measurements are most reliable when made on single crystals, since with such materiallocal variations in impurity which affect the resistivity are less severe. Localized impurity segregation at grainboundaries in polycrystalline material may result in large resistivity variations. Such effects are common to either ofthe measurement test methods but are more severe with the four-probe test method, and its use, therefore, is notrecommended for polycrystalline material.2.3 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard. The values given in parentheses are forinformation only.NOTE 1: DIN 50430 is an equivalent method to Method A and DIN 50431 is an equivalent method to Method B.NOTE 2: Other standardized test methods are preferred for use in various special circumstances. For measurements on thinwafers, use SEMI MF84; this method is preferred for referee measurements on silicon wafers. For measurements on specimensfor which point contacts are unsatisfactory, use a procedure in ASTM Test Methods F 76 based either on Van Der Pauw or bridgespecimens. For two-probe referee measurements on cylindrical single crystal bars, use SEMI MF397. For four-probe refereemeasurements of sheet resistance on epitaxial layers deposited on or diffused or implanted into opposite conductivity-typesubstrates, use SEMI MF374.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 In making resistivity measurements, spurious results can arise from a number of sources. The following mustbe guarded against:"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 19 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF43-0705 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2005 2 3.1.1 Photoconductive and photovoltaic effects can seriously influence the observed resistivity, particularly withnearly intrinsic material. Therefore make all determinations in a dark chamber unless experience has shown that thematerial is insensitive to ambient illumination.3.1.2 Spurious currents can be introduced in the testing circuit when the equipment is located near high-frequencygenerators. If equipment is located near such sources, adequate shielding must be provided.3.1.3 Minority carrier injection during the measurement can occur due to the electric field in the specimen. Withmaterial possessing high minority carrier lifetime and high resistivity, such injection can result in a lowering of theresistivity for distance of several centimeters. Carrier injection can be detected by repeating the measurements atlower current. In the absence of injection no increase in resistivity should be observed. It is recommended that thecurrent used in a resistivity measurement be as low as possible, consistent with the required precision.3.1.4 Semiconductors have a significant temperature coefficient of resistivity. Consequently, the temperature ofthe specimen should be known at the time of the measurement and the current used should be small to avoidresistive heating. If resistive heating is suspected, it can be detected by a change in readings as a function of timestarting immediately after the current is applied. Temperature coefficients for extrinsic germanium and silicon nearroom temperature are available in the literature.1 For referee purposes, it is recommended that the test be performedat 23 \xb1 0.5\xb0C.NOTE 3: Temperature correction factors for silicon are given in tabular form in SEMI MF84 together with equations forgenerating the factors.3.1.5 Vibration of the probes sometimes causes troublesome changes in the contact resistance.

The ratio of the length to the larger cross-sectional dimension of the specimen shall be not less than 3 to 1. Thecross section of the specimen must be of measurable shape and should be as uniform as possible. Prior tomeasurement, ohmic contact shall be made to the ends of the specimen (for example, by electroplating with copperor nickel or by ultrasonic soldering). Connections to the ends may be made either with soldered leads or pressurecontacts.NOTE 7: Alternative methods for forming ohmic contacts to germanium, silicon, and gallium arsenide are given in ASTM TestMethod F 76.8.2 Four-Probe Method  One reasonably flat surface for the contacting probes is required on the specimen whichmay be of any size or shape which approximates a semi-infinite solid. The conditions for a semi-infinite solid areapproximated within 2% when the thickness of the specimen and the distance from any probe to the nearest edge areboth at least four times the probe spacing.8.2.1 If the specimen is of circular cross section and has thickness more than one, but less than four, times theprobe spacing, measure the thickness and diameter as follows:8.2.1.1 Measure and record five values of thickness, wi, at various points near the center of the specimen accordingto SEMI MF533 and calculate and record the average thickness, w: ==5 151iiww (2) 8.2.1.2 Measure and record three values of the specimen diameter, D i, at the appropriate locations defined inSEMI MF2074, and calculate and record the average diameter, D: ==3 131iiDD (3) 8.3 The surface on which the resistivity is determined with either the two- or four-probe test method shall beabraded by lapping with No. 600 alumina or by sandblasting with No. 280 Carborundum, and the measurement shallbe made thereafter without unnecessary delay. The specimen shall show no surface cracks or other defectsobservable with normal vision and it shall be free of surface oxide. The abrasive grain sizes specified for thispurpose shall comply with the appropriate ANSI Specification B74.10.NOTE 8: The surface preparation procedure in the Preparation of Test Specimen section of SEMI MF84 is also acceptable. 9 Procedure9.1 Measure and record the ambient temperature. Maintain the specimen at this temperature for a time sufficientfor it to come to equilibrium.NOTE 9: The time required for equilibrium of a specimen depends on the mass of the specimen. For small specimens 30 min to1 h should suffice. For large ingots 1 to 2 days may be required.9.2 Two-Probe Method9.2.1 Measure the cross-sectional area of the specimen in cm2 and record as A.9.2.2 Connect the current leads of the electrical measuring circuit to the ends of the specimen, place the potentialprobes on the abraded surface, and adjust the current so that the electric field in the specimen does not exceed 1V/cm."),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 23 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF43-0705 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2005 6 9.2.3 Measure the potential, first across the standard resistance, then across the potential probes, and again acrossthe standard resistance.

It was available at",(0,r.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.semi.org"},"www.semi.org")," in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005. Original edition published by ASTMInternational as ASTM F 525-77T. Last previous edition SEMI MF525-00a. 1 Purpose1.1 This test method provides means for directly determining the resistivity of a substrate or of an epitaxial layer ofthickness greater than 20 times the effective electrical contact radius. Unlike SEMI MF84, SEMI MF374, andSEMI MF1392, it can provide lateral spatial resolution of resistivity on the order of a few micrometers.1.2 This test method is intended primarily for use in process control, research, and development applications. Inthe absence of between-laboratory precision data, this test method is not recommended for use between supplier andcustomer unless correlation experiments have been conducted between the parties. 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers the measurement of the resistivity of a silicon substrate of known orientation and type,or of a uniform silicon epitaxial layer of known orientation and type that is deposited on a substrate of the same oropposite type. Resistivity of the epitaxial films can be evaluated without the necessity of thin film correction factorsprovided that the ratio of layer thickness to effective probe contact radius is greater than 20.2.2 This test method is comparative in that the resistivity of an unknown specimen is determined by comparing itsmeasured spreading resistance with that of calibration standards of known resistivity. These calibration standardsmust have the same surface finish, conductivity type, and orientation as the unknown specimen.2.3 This test method is intended for use on silicon substrates and epitaxial layers. Within-laboratory precision hasbeen determined through a multilaboratory experiment on substrates having resistivities from 0.01 to 200 \u03a9cm.2.3.1 The principles of this test method can be extended to lower and higher specimen resistivity values, but theprecision of the test method has not been evaluated for values other than those in the range given in 2.3.2.4 This test method is nondestructive in the sense that the specimen is not totally destroyed in making themeasurements, the specimen need not be cut into a special shape, and no destructive processing need be done on thespecimen. However, the probe can produce mechanical damage that may be detrimental to a device fabricated in theprobed area.2.5 The volume of semiconductor material sampled is proportional to the third power of the effective electricalcontact radius of the probe. For an effective electrical contact radius of 2 m, the volume sampled by a single probeis approximately 1011 cm3.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Temperature  Spreading resistance measurements are sensitive to the temperature of the specimen.Therefore, it is important that the calibration and actual measurements be made at the same temperature.3.2 Light  Photoconductive and photovoltaic effects can seriously influence the resistance determined by this testmethod, especially on wafers with p-n junctions. All determinations shall be made in a dark chamber, or ifexperience shows that the material is insensitive to illumination of this type, in diffuse room light."),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 39 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF525-0705 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2005 2 3.3 Radio-Frequency Fields  Spurious currents can be introduced in the testing circuit when the equipment islocated near high-frequency generators. If equipment is located near such sources, adequate shielding must beprovided.3.4 Mechanical Vibrations  The apparatus may be sensitive to building or other vibrations. Therefore, the probeshould be located in an area free from significant vibrations. It may be desirable to mount the probe assembly on avibration-free table.3.5 Minority Carrier Injection  Caution should be taken to prevent minority carrier injection during themeasurement. Experience has shown that if the potential on the probe is kept to 20 mV or less, minority carrierinjection does not occur.3.6 Reactive Atmosphere  Exposure of the probe or specimen to reactive atmospheres, such as those produced inthe vicinity of epitaxial reactors or by high humidity, leads to changes in the characteristics of the instrument and tononreproducible measurements. Probes and specimens shall be protected from such exposure. Relative humidity inexcess of 60% shall be avoided.3.7 Semiconductor Surfaces3.7.1 Surface Instability  It has been found that spreading resistance measurements made on surfaces that havebeen exposed to an aqueous solution may be erratic. Surfaces exposed to solutions containing fluorine ions mayalso exhibit instability. The heat treatment included in the procedure (see 13.5) may reduce these instabilities.3.7.2 Surface Damage  Spreading resistance measurements made in areas of severe or nonuniform mechanicaldamage may give erroneous results. Such damage may be caused by previous spreading resistance probe marks.3.8 Correction Factors  When the ratio of epitaxial layer thickness, t, to the effective electrical contact radius ofthe probe, a, is less than 20, it is necessary to employ correction factors to determine the correct resistivity valuefrom the spreading resistance measurement.1 4 Referenced Standards and Documents4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E89  Guide for Measurement System Analysis (MSA)SEMI M59  Terminology for Silicon TechnologySEMI MF26  Test Methods for Determining the Orientation of a Semiconductive Single CrystalSEMI MF42  Test Methods for Conductivity Type of Extrinsic Semiconducting MaterialsSEMI MF84  Test Method for Measuring Resistivity of Silicon Slices with an In-line Four-point ProbeSEMI MF95  Test Method for Thickness of Lightly Doped Silicon Epitaxial Layers on Heavily Doped SiliconSubstrates Using an Infrared Dispersive SpectrophotometerSEMI MF110  Test Method for Thickness of Epitaxial or Diffused Layers in Silicon by the Angle Lapping andStaining TechniqueSEMI MF374  Test Method for Sheet Resistance of Silicon Epitaxial, Diffused Polysilicon, and Ion-implantedLayers Using an In-Line Four-Point Probe with the Single-configuration ProcedureSEMI MF1392  Test Method for Determining Net Carrier Density Profiles in Silicon Wafers by Capacitance-Voltage Measurements With a Mercury Probe4.2 ASTM StandardE 1  Specification for ASTM Thermometers2 1 Dickey, J.

The specimens tested were four (111) p-type chips from about0.05 to about 1500 \u03a9cm, six (111) n-type chips from about 0.01 to about 500 \u03a9cm, one (100) n-type chip at about10 \u03a9cm and three (100) p-type chips from about 0.01 to about 10 \u03a9cm. Analyses of data to obtain estimates ofrandom error were done separately for three categories of specimen preparation for which sufficient data werereturned to obtain reliable estimates. In each category of specimen preparation, estimates of random error wereobtained for the resistivity range from 0.01 to 200 \u03a9cm; estimates were not obtained from the two specimens ofhighest resistivity.16.2 The two components of within-laboratory random error that were evaluated for each specimen preparationcategory and resistivity range are the repeatability,r, the relative standard deviation of a set of measurementsobtained after a single preparation of a specimen, and the reproducibility,R, the relative standard deviation ofmeasurement averages following re-preparations of a specimen. A summary of the estimates of these componentsbased on the results of the multilaboratory experiment is given in Table 1, which gives the 90th percentile values forr andR in each category. The 90th percentile value is the value ofr orR below which 90% of the contributedvalues for that parameter in that category fall. It is expected to be a conservative estimate ofr orR about 90% ofthe time for predicting the precision achievable by a well-controlled laboratory.

No estimate of interlaboratory precisionwas derived from this multilaboratory experiment.NOTE 10: These estimates of random error were based on data from laboratories that gave evidence of being in control of thespecimen preparation and measurement processes. They are values that should be obtainable by any laboratory which is incontrol of the measurement process.

These procedures are applied to the results of the multilaboratory experiment to provide an example oftheir use. They may also be used with valuesr andR derived from in-house experimentation to provide anestimate of the precision to be expected in a particular location.

To avoidpossible confusion of analysis due to differing qualities of each laboratory's own calibration specimens, conversionof data to resistivity values was not required.R1-2 Table R1-1 summarizes the combinations of resistivity level, conductivity type, and crystallographicorientation for the specimens used in this multilaboratory test. Table R1-2 summarizes the probe material, probeload, and specific specimen preparation conditions; entries in this table are organized under general categories ofspecimen preparation.Table R1-1 Description of Silicon Specimens Used in Spreading Resistance Round RobinSpecimen Designation C D E F G H J K L M N P R TCrystal Orientation (111) (111) (111) (111) (111) (100) (100) (111) (100) (111) (111) (111) (100) (111)Conductivity Type n p p n p n p n p n n p p nNominal Resistivity (\u03a9cm) 0.5 10 1500 500 0.5 10 10 0.01 0.01 10 180 0.05 1 75 R1-3 Two quantities were calculated to characterize each laboratory's data on each specimen. The two quantitiesare r, the average of the relative standard deviations from each set of 25 measurements, andR, the standarddeviation of the 4 measurement averages on a given specimen, each expressed as a percent of the overallmeasurement average for that lab on that specimen. The first parameter is a measure of the repeatability, or freedomfrom scatter, of measurements on a fixed surface, assuming there is no inherent resistivity variation to the specimenover the area measured; the second parameter is a measure of reproducibility of measured value followingindependent specimen preparations and measurements. A summary of values of these parameters, as well as thegrand averages of spreading resistance values are given in Table R1-3. The entries are organized under the generalcategories of specimen preparation used. Separate analyses of measurement precision were done for each categoryexcept for lapping with aluminum oxide; for this category there were insufficient data (only one laboratory) for areliable analysis. Values of average spreading resistance are listed for completeness of record only; they were notused for data screening or for formal analysis.R1-4 A variety of choices of probe load, probe material, and specific details of specimen preparation are found tooccur within each of the general specimen preparation categories. The number of laboratories that used any onespecific set of specimen and probe conditions was too small to allow any reliable estimate of precision to be madefor that set of specific conditions. Several assumptions were made regarding analysis of the data: (1) the data couldbe pooled within each general specimen preparation category without further regard for the specific details ofspecimen preparation or measurement condition, (2) the results of the analysis would represent estimates of theprecision which could be expected by a laboratory in reasonable control of the spreading resistance instrumentationand of the chosen type of specimen preparation, and (3) within each specimen preparation category, estimates of r"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 49 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF525-0705 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2005 12 andR could be calculated that would apply to broad ranges of resistivity values without further respect to specimencrystallographic orientation or conductivity type.Table R1-2 Description of Probe and Specimen Preparation Conditions Used in Each LaboratoryLaboratory Number Probe Material Probe Load, g Specimen PreparationDiamond Planar-Polished3 Tungsten-Osmium 10 0.5 m diamond3 Tungsten-Osmium 20 0.5 m diamond5 Tungsten-Osmium 45 0.5 m diamond14 Tungsten-Osmium 45 1 m diamondDiamond Bevel-Polished1 Tungsten-Osmium 20 0.1 m diamond3 Tungsten-Osmium 10 0.1 m diamond3 Tungsten-Osmium 20 0.1 m diamond4 Tungsten-Ruthenium 5 0.25 m diamond6 Tungsten-Osmium 10 0.5 m diamond9 Tungsten-Osmium 22 0.1 m diamond9 Tungsten-Osmium 5 0.1 m diamond12 Tungsten-Osmium 20 0.1 m diamondSilica Bevel-Polished3 Tungsten-Osmium 10 3 Tungsten-Osmium 10 Bake at 150\xb0C3 Tungsten-Osmium 20 3 Tungsten-Osmium 20 Bake at 150\xb0C7 (Instrument 1) Tungsten-Osmium 20 Bake at 150\xb0C7 (Instrument 2) Tungsten-Osmium 20 Bake at 150\xb0C15 Tungsten-Osmium 45 Silica + 5% H2O211 Tungsten-Osmium 20 (low penetration) pH = 8Aluminum Oxide Lapped10 Tungsten-Osmium 45 5 m Lapped Surface R1-5 No independent checks of measurement quality were available; all inferences regarding control of themeasurement process by the participating laboratories had to be made from the test data supplied. To this end,within each specimen preparation category, all contributed values of r andR were rank ordered. Any laboratorywhich contributed significantly more than its expected fraction of the large values of either parameter was totallydropped from further analysis. (The only exception was Laboratory 3 in the diamond-planar-polished category.Although its data were generally higher than those from the other two laboratories, they were generally ofreasonable absolute value and were likely due to the noticeably lower probe loads used by Laboratory 3.) As a resultof this screening, data from the following laboratories were omitted from further analysis: diamond bevelpolishingLaboratory 6 and Laboratory 9 at 5 g, silica bevel polishingLaboratory 11.R1-5.1 Plots of average values of r andR as a function of resistivity only are shown in Figure R1-1. These plotswere obtained by simple averaging of all values of these parameters, as a function of specimen resistivity, for alllaboratories whose data were not rejected. From these plots it is seen that single fixed values of r, orR, do notapply to the entire range of specimen resistivities measured. Each category of diamond polish appears to have areasonably constant value of r orR, for the specimen range from 0.05 to 200 \u03a9cm. Silica-beveled specimenshave a reasonably constant value of  in this resistivity range; however, it is difficult to establish a single value ofRover any reasonable resistivity range for silica-polished specimens.R1-5.2 Re-examination of laboratory data for the two highest resistivity specimens indicated a strong possibility ofresistivity variations in these two specimens as well as a variety of reported probe control problems that were not"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 50 --",">"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"SEMI MF525-0705 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 200513 found with the lower resistivity specimens. It was therefore decided to omit the two highest resistivity specimensfrom further analysis.R1-6 Tests of the distribution of reported values of r andR within each category indicated that they had too muchvariability to be consistent with single underlying values of repeatability and reproducibility in any of thepreparation categories. It is probable that some of this excess variability resulted from the variety of probeconditions and specimen orientations, conductivity types, and surface preparation details. Nevertheless, the effect ofthis excess variability was that overall estimates of r andR could not be obtained from root-mean-square poolingof the respective variances. These overall estimates were obtained instead as percentiles of the distributions of thecontributed values in each category from specimens in the resistivity range from 0.01 to 200 \u03a9cm.Table R1-3 Summary of Round Robin DataSpecimen IdentificationLab# C D E F G H J K L M N P R TDiamond-Planar Polish#1310 g4.16 k\u03a95.1%2.2%18.1 k\u03a93.5%2.5%2.09 M\u03a926.0%9.7%9.19 M\u03a96.6%2.9%1.01 k\u03a94.5%2.6%42.1 k\u03a92.2%1.4%19.2 k\u03a94.1%1.4%74.6 \u03a96.8%3.1%12.0 \u03a97.5%4.5%55.6 k\u03a96.3%2.8%1.98 M\u03a96.8%3.0%36.1 \u03a90.9%2.2%1.17 k\u03a95.0%2.5%745 k\u03a93.4%2.5%320 g2.05 k\u03a92.2%1.7%10.6 k\u03a92.2%1.4%5.79 M\u03a925.0%12.0%4.37 M\u03a94.6%2.9%587 \u03a92.8%1.7%25.2 k\u03a92.5%1.8%11.3 k\u03a92.6%1.6%49.0 \u03a97.1%2.1%6.75 \u03a96.6%1.5%28.9 k\u03a92.4%2.0%860. k\u03a94.7%2.1%24.1 \u03a94.9%2.2%779. \u03a96.0%2.2%358 k\u03a91.4%2.0%5 B 886. \u03a91.2%6.05 k\u03a90.9%4.36 M\u03a920.0%1.59 M\u03a96.5%316 \u03a92.0%15.4 k\u03a92.2%7.14 k\u03a90.4%24.0 \u03a91.7%3.88 \u03a90.8%12.7 k\u03a94.5%470. k\u03a90.0%12.2 \u03a90.7411. \u03a92.1%219 k\u03a92.9%14 1.69 k\u03a90.4%1.6%9.22 k\u03a90.3%1.6%1.09 M\u03a91.6%1.2%4.16 M\u03a95.1%10.9%728 \u03a90.8%3.8%15.8 k\u03a90.3%1.0%9.51 k\u03a90.3%1.3%35.1 \u03a90.5%0.9%5.34 \u03a90.5%2.3%21.3 k\u03a90.8%1.8%487. k\u03a90.2%1.1%17.6 \u03a91.3%1.1%1.01 k\u03a91.1%4.6%215 k\u03a92.4%8.5%Diamond-Bevel Polish#11 2.20 k\u03a95.6%4.6%10.4 k\u03a91.4%3.4%6.15 M\u03a91.8%28.0%6.15 M\u03a911.8%14.4%744. \u03a92.3%3.6%24.5 k\u03a91.2%2.0%11.1 k\u03a91.9%2.0%54.8 \u03a98.1%4.0%9.51 \u03a920.0%6.0%27.2 k\u03a96.8%5.6%888 k\u03a90.9%6.1%26.2 \u03a90.6%1.9%726 \u03a92.5%4.0%370 k\u03a92.5%5.8%310 g3.36 k\u03a91.6%3.0%17.9 k\u03a92.1%2.7%7.21 M\u03a93.5%3.5%15.8 M\u03a95.3%4.2%1.22 k\u03a91.5%3.6%45.2 k\u03a94.2%1.7%21.3 k\u03a91.4%3.6%72.4 \u03a93.6%3.8%9.89 \u03a94.4%4.6%58.2 k\u03a93.6%3.6%2.46 M\u03a94.0%4.0%42.2 \u03a96.2%3.0%1.36 k\u03a93.0%2.6%1.01 M\u03a92.3%3.5%320 g2.33 k\u03a92.5%2.5%10.5 k\u03a91.3%1.8%2.48 M\u03a96.90%3.9%7.10 M\u03a95.5%3.7%698. \u03a93.6%3.2%24.0 k\u03a91.5%1.7%11.8 k\u03a92.4%2.4%49.4 \u03a94.6%3.3%6.35 \u03a94.9%1.7%11.3 k\u03a92.4%2.4%1.04 M\u03a95.8%2.9%25.0 \u03a93.0%2.3%824 \u03a91.8%2.3%424 k\u03a92.3%2.2%4 5.43 k\u03a91.8%2.9%22.5 k\u03a92.4%2.6%20.5 M\u03a93.8%4.6%13.6 M\u03a918.0%9.8%1.54 k\u03a91.7%3.1%67.3 k\u03a91.8%2.4%27.6 k\u03a91.8%2.4%105 \u03a91.4%1.9%14.2 \u03a94.5%1.8%70.0 k\u03a94.4%4.2%3.03 M\u03a98.4%8.0%1.06 M\u03a91.6%3.4%6 4.09 k\u03a92.2%5.9%17.9 k\u03a93.1%4.5%3.24 M\u03a92.60%8.0%10.2 M\u03a917.9%12.6%1.52 k\u03a916.2%10.0%39.1 k\u03a90.7%3.4%15.7 k\u03a90.8%2.0%108 \u03a911.0%8.1%20.4 \u03a912.6%19.4%54.4 k\u03a97.4%8.7%1.48 M\u03a922.0%15.5%58.6 \u03a96.9%10.7%1.40 k\u03a92.0%8.8%647 k\u03a92.5%13.1%922 g2.30 k\u03a94.2%4.0%13.2 k\u03a94.4%7.6%33.9 M\u03a910.7%46.0%3.79 M\u03a97.7%9.9%877 \u03a95.3%6.3%28.3 k\u03a92.4%1.3%15.1 k\u03a92.3%5.4%44.6 \u03a92.8%2.1%6.48 \u03a92.7%3.2%30.9 k\u03a92.9%3.8%1.16 M\u03a95.2%3.4%27.5 \u03a92.2%2.3%1.05 k\u03a93.5%5.0%525 k\u03a91.8%4.6%95 g7.84 k\u03a95.6%9.7%62.6 k\u03a99.0%18.4%12.6 M\u03a911.0%10.2%16.0 M\u03a96.2%5.1%3.96 k\u03a91.7%18.7%60.3 k\u03a91.4%1.5%35.8 k\u03a93.7%5.3%122 \u03a921.0%5.3%15.9 \u03a99.0%8.0%92.8 k\u03a99.7%5.2%6.89 M\u03a916.0%8.7%86.5 \u03a95.6%8.1%3.36 k\u03a99.9%20.0%1.67 M\u03a915.0%6.2%12 4.91 k\u03a91.8%5.2%14.8 k\u03a93.9%8.0%40.7 M\u03a96.5%35.0%28.8 M\u03a95.1%13.3%830 \u03a94.9%3.3%31.1 k\u03a91.5%3.6%14.9 k\u03a92.8%5.6%47.9 \u03a95.4%3.5%8.45 \u03a95.1%4.4%41.3 k\u03a90.6%8.7%3.39 M\u03a96.5%9.9%49.2 \u03a93.2%5.1%1.69 k\u03a98.5%7.3%1.48 M\u03a911.9%6.8%Silica-Bevel Polish#1310 g3.82 k\u03a914.0%2.6%65.8 k\u03a930.0%4.7%888 k\u03a980.0%6.4%616 k\u03a93.0%12.3%1.88 k\u03a911.3%3.7%38.2 k\u03a917.8%2.3%87.8 k\u03a917.8%2.3%73.8 \u03a96.3%2.0%10.3 \u03a95.4%3.3%34.0 k\u03a921.6%3.1%468 k\u03a914.7%6.0%30.9 \u03a93.1%1.7%1.57 k\u03a92.0%1.7%573 k\u03a933.0%6.3%310 gbaked2.95 k\u03a912.5%2.8%31.1 k\u03a98.5%2.3%943 k\u03a925.0%7.8%723 k\u03a923.0%6.7%1.45 k\u03a94.1%3.6%30.9 k\u03a914.6%2.7%35.4 k\u03a97.0%2.2%79.2 \u03a93.8%1.9%10.7 \u03a90.7%3.2%31.1 k\u03a99.2%2.8%610 k\u03a949.0%6.1%30.7 \u03a91.5%1.3%1.27 k\u03a96.6%1.5%365 k\u03a929.0%6.4%")))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
