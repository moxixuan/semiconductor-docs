When a steadyabsorbance reading is obtained, after approximately 510 minutes, the true concentration of the standard shallbe recorded. Record the pressure in the gas cell using acalibrated pressure-measuring device.5.4.2 To determine the concentration of diborane inthe mixture set the sample flow through the cellfollowing the same procedures as detailed above.Record the absorption at the same wave number as thecalibration standard. Ensure that gas cell pressures areequal during calibration and the determination.Calculate the concentration of diborane. The result mustconform to the specification in Section 4 of thisstandard.

SEMI C3.56-0600 © SEMI 20003 APPENDIX 1STABILITY OF DIBORANE MIXTURES (FOR INFORMATION ONLY) NOTE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI C3.56 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures on April4, 2000 by the European Regional Standards Committee.A1-1 The stability of diborane mixtures in N2, Ar, or He depends on the concentration of diborane and on thestorage temperature. At ambient temperature best stability is found for mixtures of diborane in hydrogen. Nodifference in stability could be found for different cylinder materials (steel, stainless steel, aluminum).A1-2 The following values were measured for different concentrations of diborane at two different storagetemperatures: Storage Temperature Diborane Concentration (%) in Nitrogen after2 17 45 100 160 Days8 °C 0.549 0.547 0.547 0.543 0.54222 °C 0.549 0.544 0.539 0.530 0.5268 °C 5.05 4.91 4.87 4.85 4.7822 °C 5.05 4.92 4.83 4.72 4.498 °C 10.51 10.45 10.43 10.19 10.0022 °C 10.59 10.30 10.08 9.44 8.85 A1-3 Based on these results it is recommended to keep mixtures at low temperature.
