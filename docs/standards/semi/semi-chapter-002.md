appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
3  Limitations
3. 1      SEMI   E6   applies   to   the   facility   interface   of
semiconductor    equipment    only.    Other    equipment
interfaces,  such  as  the  physical  interfaces  for  material
handling  (see  SEMI  E106  and  related  standards)  and
software interfaces (see SEMI Information and Control
Standards) are defined by other SEMI Standards.
3. 2    This  guide  is  not  intended  to  address  the  internal
connections   of   the   equipment   that   are   typically
completed  by  the  equipment  supplier.  This  document
includes    only    information    related    to    the    utility
connections  on  the  equipment  or  support  equipment
that   are   the   responsibility   of   the   semiconductor
manufacturer’s equipment installation team.
3. 3        This    guide    is    not    intended    to    address    the

5  Terminology
NOTE     1:     A     complete     list     of     equipment     installation
terminology can be found in SEMI E70.
5. 1  Definitions
5. 1.1  idle  —  the  condition  where  the  equipment  is
energized and readied for processing (all systems ready
and   temperatures   controlled)   but   is   not   actually
performing   any   active   function   such   as   material
movement or processing.
5. 1.1.1  idle  average  flow  —  the  average  flow  rate
when  the  equipment  is  in  idle  condition.  Idle  average
flow  should  be  measured  at  the  equipment  point  of
connection.
5. 1.2  maximum pressure — the highest supply pressure
that can be used for the equipment to operate correctly.
Maximum    pressure    should    be    measured    at    the
equipment  point  of  connection  and  may  be  driven  by
process requirements or component limits.
5. 1.3  maximum  pressure  fluctuation  —  the  maximum
supply pressure change during the processing cycle for
the equipment to operate correctly.
5. 1.4  minimum   pressure   —   the   minimum   supply
pressure  that  must  be  maintained  or  exceeded  for  the
equipment   to   operate   correctly.   Minimum   pressure
should   be   measured   at   the   equipment   point   of
connection.
5. 1.5  processing cycle — a sequence wherein all of the
material  contained  in  a  processing  unit  is  processed.
This is often used as a measure of action or time [SEMI
E30]. (See Figure 1.)
5. 1.5.1  process  average  flow  —  the  average  flow  rate
over the processing cycle. Process average flow should
be measured at the equipment point of connection.
6  Ordering and Use
6. 1        Semiconductor    manufacturers    may    use    this
standard  when  procuring  semiconductor  equipment  to
specify type and format of facility interface information
to be provided by equipment supplier.
6. 2  Orders for semiconductor equipment in accordance
with  this  standard  should  include  the  standard  number
and  date  of  issue.  The  request  should  also  include
documentation  due  date,  the  data  transmission  method,
file  format  for  data,  file  format  for  drawings,  and  any
additional information to be included that is not covered
in SEMI E6.
6. 3  Roles   and   Responsibilities   —   The   equipment
supplier  submits  information  requested  in  SEMI  E6.
Unless otherwise specified, equipment suppliers should
submit the utilities and installation information prior to
the     equipment     ship     date.     The     semiconductor
manufacturer’s      equipment      engineers,      facilities

8. 2    Equipment  suppliers  should  provide  data  for  all
necessary  facilities  even  if  not  specifically  covered  in
the  data  sheets  included  in  this  standard.  (See  Section
19, Other Data Sheets)
8. 3  Data Sheet Format
8. 3.1    The  data  sheets  in  this document are designed to
facilitate use of electronic communication and database
storage of the facility interface information.
8. 3.2            The      format      shown      also      provides      a
recommendation for printed output of the information.
8. 3.3    The  data  sheets  shown  define  data  relationships
that  can  be  used  for  spreadsheet  or  database  storage  of
the information.
• A number, 100–1000, identifies each datasheet.
• A letter, starting with A, identifies each column of
the data sheet.
• A  number,  starting  with  1,  identifies  each  row  of
the data sheet.
• Data  item  names  are  in  the  first  row  of  each  data
sheet.
• Units of measure for the data are in the second row
of  each  data  sheet.  (In  many  cases  a  simple  data
definition such as text or number is provided in this
row.)
• Specific equipment data starts in row 3 of each data
sheet.  One  row  per  equipment  component  in  data
sheets  200  and  300.  One  row  per  connection  in
data sheets 400 through 1000.
8. 4  Data Entry
8. 4.1    As  defined  above,  data  entry  involves  the  first
three rows. Row 1 identifies data item. Enter the unit of
measure  for  data  in  row  2.  For  example:  mm.  Specific
equipment data will be entered starting in row 3.
8. 4.1.1  Preferred units of measure are listed in row 2 of
each data sheet. If data entered is in units different from
the units specified in row 2 change the units specified in
row  2  to  match  the  data.  If  two  units  of  measure  are
shown in row 2 select the unit of measure that matches
the entered data.
8. 4.1.2    Data  values  should  be  entered  in  the  units  of
measure used to design the equipment.
8. 4.1.3  Data values should be entered as numbers only.
For example: 12.0 or 300 (Do NOT enter 300 mm).
8. 4.1.4    Not  every  data  item  will  have  a  value  because
all  data  items  do  not  apply  to  all  equipment.  The
equipment  supplier  should  insert  n/a  (not  applicable)
for  any  item  that  does  not  apply  to  that  particular
equipment  component  or  connection.  Do  NOT  use  the
n/a  designation  in  place  of  missing  data  or  data  that  is
not available. If data is applicable to the equipment and
not  available  leave  the  cell  blank.  If  necessary,  include
reason for blank cells in comments cell.
8. 4.2    The  unique  Equipment  Component  identifier  is
the first column, A, of each data sheet 200–1000.
8. 4.2.1    The  data  sheets  are  designed  to  document  all
facilities  connections  including  connections  made  to
support   equipment;   therefore   a   unique   equipment
component   name   should   be   used   to   locate   each
connection.  Included  equipment  components  should  be
the  mainframe  unit  plus  any  other  support  equipment
provided  by  the  equipment  supplier,  including  but  not
limited to vacuum pumps, process chambers, load lock
pumps,  water  heaters,  gas  boxes,  gas  panels,  chillers,
radio    frequency    generators,    and    electrical    power
distribution panels.
8. 4.3    The  unique  Connection  Number  is  the  second
column, B, of each data sheet 400–1000.


SEMI E6-0303 © SEMI 1982, 2003 4
8. 4.3.1    There  should  be  a  unique  Connection  Number,
or  identifier,  for  every  connection.  If  a  utility  type  has
more  than  one  connection,  each  point  of  connection
should have a number.
8. 4.3.2      A   consistent   Connection   Numbering   system
should   be   used   to   identify   all   connections   in   all
documents relating to the equipment.
8. 4.4    The  Connection  Label  is  the  third  column,  C,  of
each  data  sheet  400-1000.  The  Connection  Label  and
Connection Number system should provide a clear link
between all documentation and the actual connection on
the equipment.
8. 4.5  Utility Type is the fourth column, D, of each data
sheet   400–1000.   A   consistent   Utility   Type   naming
convention  should  be  used  to  identify  the  utility  types
in   all   documents   relating   to   the   equipment.   (For
example SEMI E52 should be used for defining gases.)
8. 4.6    Fitting  Size,  Fitting  Material,  and  Fitting  Type
(found  in  most  data  sheets)  refer  to  connectors  or
fittings  on  the  equipment;  such  that  the  equipment
purchaser   can   identify   and   procure   the   matching
connector for fit up to the equipment. Do not define the
facilities side connectors in these data sheets.
8. 4.7  Comments are the last column of each data sheet
400–1000.  All  comments  should  be  entered  in  a  single
cell   at   the   end   of   the   row   corresponding   to   the
connection requiring comment. Comments may need to
be   repeated   in   comments   cell   for   each   similar
connection.  General  comments  for  equipment  model
may be included in the comments cell in table 100, or if
specific  to  an  equipment  component  in  tables  200  or

# 300

300.
8. 5  Data Collection
8. 5.1        Actual    measured    utility    data,    based    upon
representative  operating  conditions,  is  preferred  over
unverified estimates or calculations.
8. 5.2    All  data  measures  of  flow  rate,  chemical  waste,
dump   volumes,   etc.,   should   be   based   upon   the
supplier’s standard process and production rate.
8. 5.3      All   specifications   and   measurements   in   data
sheets  400–1000  should  be  at  the  equipment  point  of
connection.
8. 5.4    If  utility  consumption  data  entered  into  the  data
sheet  is  not  measured  data,  note  in  the  comments  cell
how  the  data  was  obtained.  For  example:  calculated
data or estimated data.
8. 6      The   following   sections,   9   through   19,   include
recommendations  on  how  to  complete  each  individual
data sheet.

SPECIFICATION FOR DEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT OF
EQUIPMENT RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, AND MAINTAINABILITY
(RAM)
This specification was technically approved by the Global Metrics Committee and is the direct responsibility
of  the  North  American  Metrics  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North  American  Regional
Standards  Committee  on  October  15,  2003.  Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  February  2004;  to  be
published March 2004. Originally published in 1986; previously published July 2001.
E
This  standard  was  editorially  modified  in  February  2004  to  include  changes  omitted  from  the  previous
edition. Changes were made to Table 1, Table R1-3, and Section R1-7.
1  Purpose
1. 1    This  document  establishes  a  common  basis  for
communication    between    users    and    suppliers    of
semiconductor  manufacturing  equipment  by  providing
standards  for  measuring  RAM  performance  of  that
equipment in a manufacturing environment.
2  Scope
2. 1    The  document  defines  six  basic  equipment  states
into which all equipment conditions and periods of time
must  fall.    The  equipment  states  are  determined  by
functional  issues,  independent  of  who  performs  the
function.    The  measurement  of  equipment  reliability  in
this  specification  concentrates  on  the  relationship  of
equipment  failures  to  equipment  usage,  rather  than  the
relationship of failures to total elapsed time.
2. 2        Section    5    (Equipment    States)    defines    how
equipment   time   is   categorized.   Section   6   (RAM
Measurement)  defines  formulas  for  measurement  of
equipment    performance.        Section    7    (Uncertainty
Measurement)  gives  additional  methods  for  evaluating
the  statistical  significance  of  calculated  performance
metrics.
2. 3    Effective  application  of  this  specification  requires
that  equipment  performance  (RAM)  be  tracked  with
regard  to  time  and/or  equipment  cycles.    Automated
tracking  of  equipment  states  is  not  within  the  scope  of
this  specification,  but  is  covered  by  SEMI  E58.    Clear
and effective communication among users and suppliers
promotes    continuous    improvement    in    equipment
performance.
2. 4    The  RAM  indices  in  this  specification  may  be
applied   directly   to   non-cluster   tools   at   the   whole
equipment  and  sub-system  levels.    The  RAM  indices
may  be  applied  at  the  sub-system  level  (e.g.,  process
module) for multi-path cluster tools.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

4  Terminology
4. 1  Definitions
4. 1.1  availability  —  the  probability  that  the  equipment
will  be  in  a  condition  to  perform  its  intended  function
when required.
4. 1.2  cluster  tool  —  a  manufacturing  system  made  up
of  integrated  processing  modules  mechanically  linked
together  (the  modules  may  or  may  not  come  from  the
same supplier).
4. 1.2.1  single  path  cluster  tool — a  cluster  tool  with
only one process flow path (as used).
4. 1.2.2  multi-path  cluster  tool  ó  a  cluster  tool  with
more  than  one  independent  process  flow  path  (e.g.,
multiple    load    ports/load-locks,    multiple    process
chambers of the same type) and used as such.
4. 1.3  cycle   —   one   complete   operational   sequence
(including   unit   load   and   unload)   of   processing,
manufacturing, or testing steps for an equipment system
or  subsystem.    In  single  unit  processing  systems,  the
number of cycles equals the number of units processed.
In  batch  systems,  the  number  of  cycles  equals  the
number of batches processed.
4. 1.4  downtime (DT) — the time when the equipment is
not  in  a  condition,  or  is  not  available,  to  perform  its
intended  function.    It  does  not  include  any  portion  of
non-scheduled time.



SEMI E10-0304
E
© SEMI 1986, 2004 2
4. 1.5  downtime   event   —   a   detectable   occurrence
significant  to  the  equipment  that  causes  the  equipment
to  go  from  an  uptime  state  to  either  a  scheduled  or  an
unscheduled downtime state.
4. 1.6  failure  —  any  unscheduled  downtime  event  that
changes  the  equipment  to  a  condition  where  it  cannot
perform   its   intended   function.      Any   part   failure,
software  or  process  recipe  problem,  facility  or  utility
supply  malfunction,  or  human  error  could  cause  the
failure.
NOTE  1:    It  is  important  to  categorize  and  qualify  failures  in
ways  that  facilitate  the  resolution  of  problems  and  improve
overall  equipment  performance.    Use  of  this  specification
requires agreement between supplier and user on categorizing
failures.
4. 1.7  equipment-related   failure   ó   any   unplanned
event  that  changes  the  equipment  to  a  condition  where
it cannot perform its intended function solely caused by

4. 1.8  host  ó  the  intelligent  system  that  communicates
with  the  equipment,  acts  as  a  supervisory  agent,  and
represents the factory and the user to the equipment.
4. 1.9  intended  function  —  a  manufacturing  function
that the equipment was built to perform.  This includes
transport    functions    for    transport    equipment    and
measurement  functions  for  metrology  equipment,  as
well   as   process   functions   such   as   physical   vapor
deposition and wire bonding.  Complex equipment may
have more than one intended function.
4. 1.10  maintainability   —   the   probability   that   the
equipment   will   be   retained   in,   or   restored   to,   a
condition  where  it  can  perform  its  intended  function
within a specified period of time.
4. 1.11  maintenance  —  the  act  of  sustaining  equipment
in  or  restoring  it  to  a  condition  to  perform  its  intended
function.   In   this   document,   maintenance   refers   to
function,   not   organization;   it   includes   adjustments,
change   of   consumables,   software   upgrades,   repair,
preventive  maintenance,  etc.,  no  matter  who  performs
the task.
4. 1.12  manufacturing  time  —  the  sum  of  productive
time and standby time.
4. 1.13  non-scheduled   time   —   the   time   when   the
equipment is not scheduled to be utilized in production.
4. 1.14  operations  time  (oper-time)  —  total  time  minus
non-scheduled time.
4. 1.15  operator   —   any   person   who   communicates
locally  with  the  equipment  through  the  equipmentís
control panel.
4. 1.16  product  ó  units  produced  during  productive
time (see unit).
4. 1.17  ramp-down  —  the  portion  of  a  maintenance
procedure required to prepare the equipment for hands-
on  work.    It  includes  purging,  cool-down,  warm-up,
software    backup,    storing    dynamic    values    (e.g.,
parameters,  recipes),  etc.  Ramp-down  is  only  included
in scheduled and unscheduled downtime.
4. 1.18  ramp-up   —   the   portion   of   a   maintenance
procedure    required,    after    the    hands-on    work    is
completed, to return the equipment to a condition where
it  can  perform  its  intended  function.    It  includes  pump
down,   warm-up,   stabilization   periods,   initialization
routines,  software  load,  restoring  dynamic  values  (e.g.,
parameters, recipes), control system reboot, etc. It does
not include equipment or process test time.  Ramp-up is
only included in scheduled and unscheduled downtime.
4. 1.19  reliability — the  probability  that  the  equipment
will   perform   its   intended   function,   within   stated
conditions, for a specified period of time
4. 1.20  shutdown   —   the   time   required   to   put   the
equipment  in  a  safe  condition  when  entering  a  non-
scheduled  state.    It  includes  any  procedures  necessary
to reach a safe condition.  Shutdown is only included in
non-scheduled time.
4. 1.21  specification    (equipment    operation)    —    the
documented  set  of  intended  functions  within  stated
conditions  for  equipment  operation  as  agreed  upon
between user and supplier.
4. 1.22  start-up  —  the  time  required  for  equipment  to
achieve  a  condition  where  it  can  perform  its  intended
function,   when   leaving   a   non-scheduled   state.   It
includes      pump      down,      warm-up,      cool-down,
stabilization  periods,  initialization  routines,  software
load,   restoring   dynamic   values   (e.g.,   parameters,
recipes),  control  system  reboot,  etc.    Start-up  is  only
included in non-scheduled time.
4. 1.23  support tool — a tool that, although not part of a
piece of equipment, is required by and becomes integral
with  it  during  the  course  of  normal  operation  (e.g.,
cassettes,   wafer   carriers,   probe   cards,   computerized
controllers/monitors).
4. 1.24  total time — all time (at the rate of 24 hrs/day, 7
days/week)  during  the  period  being  measured.  In  order
to have a valid representation of total time, all six basic
equipment  states  must  be  accounted  for  and  tracked
accurately.

4. 1.26  training   (on-the-job)   —   the   instruction   of
personnel   in   the   operation   and/or   maintenance   of
equipment  done  during  the  course  of  normal  work
functions.      On-the-job   training   typically   does   not
interrupt  operation  or  maintenance  activities  and  can
therefore  be  included  in  any  equipment  state  (except
standby      and      non-scheduled)      without      special
categorization.

productive, standby, and engineering time, and does not
include any portion of non-scheduled time.
4. 1.29  user    —    any    entity    interacting    with    the
equipment, either locally as an operator or remotely via
the  host.    From  the  equipmentís  view  point,  both  the
operator and the host represent the user.
4. 1.30  utilization —  the  percent  of  time  the  equipment
is  performing  its  intended  function  during  a  specified
time period.
4. 1.31  verification  run  —  a  single  cycle  of  the  equip-
ment (using units or no units) used to establish that it is

5  Equipment States
5. 1  To    clearly    measure    equipment    performance
(RAM),  this  document  defines  six  basic  equipment
states  into  which  all  equipment  conditions  and  periods
of time must fall.
5. 2    The  equipment  states  are  determined  by  function,
not    by    organization.        Any    given    maintenance
procedure,  for  example,  is  classified  the  same  way  no
matter   who   performs   it,   an   operator,   a   production
technician,   a   maintenance   technician,   or   a   process
engineer.
5. 3  Figure 1 is a stack chart of the six basic equipment
states.  These basic equipment states can be divided into
as   many   sub-states   as   are   required   to   achieve   the
equipment   tracking   resolution   that   a   manufacturing
operation  desires.    SEMI  E10  makes  no  attempt  to  list
all possible sub-states, but does give some examples for
guidance.
5. 4  Key blocks of time associated with the basic states
and  example  substates  are  given  in  Figure  2.    These
blocks  of  time  are  used  in  the  RAM  equations  given
later  in  this  document.    The  blocks  of  time  associated
with   the   basic   states   and   example   substates   are
described in the following sections.

Equipment States Stack Chart

5. 5  PRODUCTIVE  STATE  —  The  time  (productive
time)  when  the  equipment  is  performing  its  intended
function.  The productive state includes:
• Regular     production     (including     loading     and
unloading of units),
• Work for third parties,
• Rework, and
• Engineering    runs    done    in    conjunction    with
production    units    (e.g.,    split    lots    and    new
applications).
5. 6  STANDBY  STATE  —  The  time  (standby  time),
other  than  non-scheduled  time,  when  the  equipment  is
in   a   condition   to   perform   its   intended   function,
chemicals  and  facilities  are  available,  but  it  is  not
operated.  The standby state includes:
• No  operator  available  (including  breaks,  lunches,
and meetings),
• No  units  available  (including  no  units  due  to  lack
of  available  support  equipment,  such  as  metrology
tools),
• No  support  tools  (e.g.,  cassettes,  wafer  carriers,
probe cards), and
• No  input  from  external  automation  systems  (i.e.,
host).
5. 7  ENGINEERING  STATE  —  The  time  (engineering
time)  when  the  equipment  is  in  a  condition  to  perform
its    intended    function    (no    equipment    or    process
problems  exist),  but  is  operated to conduct engineering
experiments.  The engineering state includes:



SEMI E10-0304
E
© SEMI 1986, 2004 4
• Process    engineering    (e.g.,    process    character-
ization),
• Equipment   engineering   (e.g.,   equipment   eval-
uation), and
• Software engineering  (e.g., software qualification).
5. 8  SCHEDULED  DOWNTIME  STATE  —  The  time
(scheduled   downtime)   when   the   equipment   is   not
available   to   perform   its   intended   function   due   to
planned  downtime  events.  The  scheduled  downtime
state includes:
• Maintenance delay (maint-delay),
• Production test,
• Preventive maintenance,
• Change of consumables/chemicals,
• Setup, and
• Facilities related (fac-rel).
5. 8.1  Maintenance  Delay  —  The  time  (maint-delay
downtime) during which the equipment cannot perform
its intended function because it is waiting for either user
or      supplier      personnel      or      parts      (including
consumables/chemicals)  associated  with  maintenance.
Maintenance delay may also be due to an administrative
decision  to  leave  the  equipment  down  and  postpone
maintenance.
5. 8.1.1    Maintenance  delays  may  occur  at  any  point  in
the   maintenance   process.   These   maintenance   delay
downtimes     must     be     tracked     separately     from
maintenance  time.  Delay  downtime  is  included  in  time
off-line,  but  not  in  time  to  repair  (see  Sections  6.3  and
6. 4 Equipment Availability and Maintainability).
5. 8.2  Production  Test  —  The  time  (production  test
downtime)  for  the  planned  interruption  of  equipment
availability  for  evaluation  of  units,  as  defined  in  the
specifications  of  equipment  operation,  to  confirm  that
the   equipment   is   performing   its   intended   function
within  specifications.  It  does  not  include  testing  that
can  be  done  in  parallel  with,  or  transparent  to,  the
running  of  production,  nor  does  it  include  any  testing
done  following  a  preventive  maintenance,  setup,  or
repair procedure.
5. 8.3  Preventive Maintenance ó The sum of the times
(preventive maintenance downtimes) for:
• Preventive    action:    A    predefined    maintenance
procedure  (including  equipment  ramp-down  and
ramp-up),   at   scheduled   intervals,   designed   to
reduce  the  likelihood  of  equipment  failure  during
operation.  Scheduled  intervals  may  be  based  upon
time, equipment cycles, or equipment conditions.
• Equipment  test:  The  operation  of  equipment  to
demonstrate  equipment  functionality;  (e.g.,  system
reaches   base   pressure,   wafers   transfer   without
problem, gas flow is correct, plasma ignites, source
reaches specified power).
• Verification  run:  The  processing  and  evaluation  of
units  after  preventive  action  to  establish  that  the
equipment   is   performing   its   intended   function
within specifications.
NOTE 2:  Equipment  suppliers  are  responsible  for  specifying
a preventive maintenance program to achieve a predetermined
equipment  performance  level.  Users  are  obligated  to  identify
any  deviation  from  the  recommended  program  if  they  expect
the supplier to meet or improve that performance level.
5. 8.4  Change  of  Consumables/Chemicals  —  The  time
(change  of  consumables/chemicals  downtime)  for  the
scheduled interruption of operation to replenish the raw
materials  of  semiconductor  processing.    It  includes
changes  of  gas  bottles,  acids,  targets,  sources,  etc.,  and
any  purging,  cleaning,  or  flushing  normally  associated
with  those  changes.    It  does  not  include  delays  in
obtaining those consumables/chemicals.
5. 8.5  Setup — The sum of the times (setup downtimes)
for:
• Conversion:  The  time  required  to  complete  an
equipment  alteration  necessary  to  accommodate  a
change in process, unit, package configuration, etc.
(excluding modifications, rebuilds, and upgrades).
• Equipment  test:  The  operation  of  equipment  to
demonstrate  equipment  functionality;  (e.g.,  system
reaches   base   pressure,   wafers   transfer   without
problem, gas flow is correct, plasma ignites, source
reaches specified power).
• Verification  run:  The  processing  and  evaluation  of
units after conversion to establish that equipment is
performing      its      intended      function      within
specifications.
NOTE 3:  Equipment  suppliers are  responsible  for  providing
procedures which achieve setup conversion and testing within
predetermined  specifications.    Users  are  obligated  to  identify
any deviation from the procedures if they expect the supplier
to make setups fall within those specifications.
5. 8.6  Facilities  Related  —  The  time  (facilities-related
downtime)   when   the   equipment  cannot  perform  its
intended   function   solely   as   a   result   of   out   of
specification facilities.  Those facilities include:
• Environmental     (e.g.,     temperature,     humidity,
vibration, particle count),
• House  hookups  (e.g.,  power,  cooling  water,  house
gases, exhaust, LN2), and



SEMI E10-0304
E

• Communications  links  with  other  equipment  or
host computers.
5. 8.6.1  Any   downtime   created   by   the   items   listed
above  shall  be  included  in  facilities-related  downtime.
For  example,  if,  as  a  result  of  a  scheduled  15-minute
power  outage  an  otherwise  unnecessary  cryo  pump
regeneration  is  needed,  all  time  required  to  return  the
equipment  to  a  condition  where  it  can  perform  its
intended   function   is   included   in   facilities-related
downtime.
5. 9  UNSCHEDULED   DOWNTIME   STATE   —   The
time  (unscheduled  downtime)  when  the  equipment  is
not  in  a  condition  to  perform  its  intended  function  due
to unplanned downtime events:
• Maintenance delay (maint-delay)
• Repair
• Change of consumables/chemicals
• Out-of-spec input
• Facilities related (fac-rel)
5. 9.1  Maintenance  Delay  —  The  time  (maint-delay
downtime) during which the equipment cannot perform
its intended function because it is waiting for either user
or      supplier      personnel      or      parts      (including
consumables/chemicals)  associated  with  maintenance.
Maintenance delay may also be due to an administrative
decision  to  leave  the  equipment  down  and  postpone
maintenance.
5. 9.1.1    Maintenance  delays  may  occur  at  any  point  in
the  maintenance  process.    These  maintenance  delay
downtimes    should    be    tracked    separately    from
maintenance time.  Delay downtime is included in time
off-line,  but  not  in  maintenance  time  (see  Sections  6.3
and 6.4 Equipment Availability and Maintainability).
5. 9.2  Repair    —    The    sum    of    the    times    (repair
downtimes) for:
• Diagnosis: The procedure of identifying the source
of an equipment problem or failure.
• Corrective   action:   The   maintenance   procedure
(including equipment ramp-down and ramp-up, re-
booting, resetting, recycling, restarting, reverting to
a  previous  software  version,  etc.)  employed  to
address   an   equipment   failure   and   return   the
equipment  to  a  condition  where  it  can  perform  its
intended function.
• Equipment  test:  The  operation  of  equipment  to
demonstrate  equipment  functionality  (e.g.,  system
reaches   base   pressure,   wafers   transfer   without
problem, gas flow is correct, plasma ignites, source
reaches specified power).
• Verification  run:  The  processing  and  evaluation  of
units  after  corrective  action  to  establish  that  the
equipment   is   performing   its   intended   function
within specifications.
5. 9.3  Change  of  Consumables/Chemicals  —  The  time
(change  of  consumables/chemicals  downtime)  for  the
unscheduled  interruption  of  operation  to  replenish  the
raw materials of semiconductor processing.  It includes
changes  of  gas  bottles,  acids,  targets,  sources,  etc.,  and
any  purging,  cleaning,  or  flushing  normally  associated
with  those  changes.    It  does  not  include  delays  in
obtaining these consumables/chemicals.
5. 9.4  Out-of-Spec Input — The time (out-of-spec input
downtime)   when   the   equipment  cannot  perform  its
intended function solely as a result of problems created
by  out-of-specification  or  faulty  inputs.    Those  inputs
include:
• Support   tools   (e.g.,   warped   cassettes   or   wafer
carriers, faulty probe cards, reticles),
• Unit   (e.g.,   upstream   process   problems,   warped
wafers, contaminated wafers, warped lead frames),
• Test  data  (e.g.,  metrology  tool  out  of  calibration,
misread      charts,      erroneous      data      interpre-
tation/entry), and
• Consumables/chemicals  (e.g.,  contaminated  acid,
leaky  target  bond,  degraded  photo  resist,  degraded
mold compound).
5. 9.4.1  Any   downtime   created   by   the   items   listed
above  shall  be  included  in  out-of-specification  input
downtime.      For   example,   if,   as   a   result   of   an
intermittent  probe  card  short,  a  prober/tester  system  is
put  down  for  repair,  all  downtime  incurred  prior  to
identifying  the  problem  is  re-categorized  as  out-of-
specification input downtime.
5. 9.5  Facilities  Related  —  The  time  (facilities-related
downtime)   when   the   equipment  cannot  perform  its
intended    function    solely    as    a    result    of    out-of-
specification facilities.  Those facilities include:
• Environmental     (e.g.,     temperature,     humidity,
vibration, particle count),
• House  hookups  (e.g.,  power,  cooling  water,  house
gases, exhaust, LN2), and
• Communications  links  with  other  equipment  or
host computers.
5. 9.5.1  Any   downtime   created   by   the   items   listed
above  shall  be  included  in  facilities-related  downtime.
For  example,  if,  as  a  result  of  an  unscheduled  15-
minute  power  outage,  an  otherwise  unnecessary  cryo
pump regeneration is needed, all time required to return



SEMI E10-0304
E
© SEMI 1986, 2004 6
the  equipment  to  a  condition  where  it  can  perform  its
intended   function   is   included   in   facilities-related
downtime.
5. 10  NON-SCHEDULED  STATE  —  The  time  (non-
scheduled time) when the equipment is not scheduled to
be  utilized  in  production,  such  as  unworked  shifts,
weekends,  and  holidays  (including  shutdown  and  start-
up).
5. 10.1  If equipment is out of the production plan due to
off-line    training    or    an    installation,    modification,
rebuild,  or  upgrade  (hardware  or  software)  that  cannot
be     accommodated     by     the     regular     preventive
maintenance  schedule,  its  status  is  the  non-scheduled
state.    This  includes  any  qualification  time  required  to
bring the equipment to a condition where it can perform
its intended function from one of these states.
5. 10.2      Any   maintenance   done   to   equipment   during
these  periods  cannot  be  counted  in  the  non-scheduled
state,   since   all   maintenance   must   fall   into   either
scheduled   or   unscheduled   downtime   (this   includes
automatic  maintenance  routines  such  as  a  programmed
cryo pump regeneration).
5. 10.3    By  the  same  convention,  any  production  or
engineering  work  done  during  these  periods  must  fall
into either productive or engineering time (this includes
an  unattended  operation  that  may  shut  itself  off  ìafter
hoursî).
6  RAM Measurement
6. 1      Reliability,   availability,   and   maintainability   are
measures  of  equipment  performance  which  have  been
used   widely   in   industry   for   decades.   This   section
defines   them   for   the   semiconductor   industry   in   a
manner   that   is   consistent   with   existing   industrial
standards.  Along  with  the  definitions  for  RAM  are
given   indicators   by   which   these   measures   can   be
quantified.
6. 2  EQUIPMENT   RELIABILITY   —   The   probability
that  the  equipment  will  perform  its  intended  function,
within stated conditions, for a specified period of time.
NOTE   4:      Two   different   methods   of   measuring   this   are
presented,  productive  time  (Sections  6.2.1  and  6.2.2)  and
equipment cycles (Sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.4):
• Productive   time   only   considers   what   happens   while
making    units    (useful    for    manufacturing    operation
purposes).
• Equipment  cycles  take  into  account  the  wear  and  tear
created  by  every  machine  cycle  during  all  equipment
states (useful for equipment reliability purposes).
6. 2.1  MTBF
p
—   Mean   (productive)   time   between
failures;  the  average  time  the  equipment  performed  its
intended  function  between  failures;  productive  time
divided  by  the  number  of  failures  during  that  time.
Only  productive  time  is  included  in  this  calculation.
Failures  that  occur  when  an  attempt  is  made  to  change
from any state to a productive state are included in this
calculation.    Using  MTBF
p
,  therefore,  requires  that  the
user  not  only  have  the  capability  of  capturing  failure
information,  but  also  tracking  and  categorizing  total
time accurately.

6. 2.2  E-MTBF
p

these    equipment-related    failures;    productive    time
divided  by  the  number  of  equipment-related  failures
during  that  time.    Only  productive  time  is  included  in
this  calculation.    Equipment-related  failures  that  occur
when an attempt is made to change from any state to a
productive state are included in this calculation.  Using
E-MTBF

have the capability of capturing failure information, but
also  tracking  and  categorizing  total  time  and  the  root
causes of failures accurately.

failures    during    those    cycles.        This    calculation
transcends  equipment  states  to  include  all  cycles  that
the     system,     or     subsystem,     being     considered
experiences.  It  does  not  require  tracking  equipment
states, only equipment cycles and equipment failures.

equipment cycles divided by the number of equipment-
related  failures  during  those  cycles.    This  calculation
transcends  equipment  states  to  include  all  cycles  that
the     system,     or     subsystem,     being     considered

6. 3  EQUIPMENT  AVAILABILITY  —  The  probability  that  the  equipment  will  be  in  a  condition  to  perform  its
intended function when required.
6. 3.1  Equipment Dependent Uptime — The percent of time the equipment is in a condition to perform its intended
function during the period of operations time minus the sum of all maintenance delay downtime, out-of-spec input
downtime,  and  facilities-related  downtime.    This  calculation  is  intended  to  reflect  equipment  reliability  and
maintainability based solely on equipment merit.
equipment dependent uptime (%) =
equipment uptime × 100
(oper-time – (all maint-delay DT + out-of-spec input DT + fac-rel DT))

6. 3.2  Supplier  Dependent  Uptime  —  The  percent  of  time  the  equipment  is  in  a  condition  to  perform  its  intended
function during the period of operations time minus the sum of user maintenance delay downtime, out-of-spec input
downtime, and facilities-related downtime.  This calculation subtracts only user maintenance delay downtime from
the period, thereby taking into account supplier delays for parts and service.  The intention is to provide an effective
performance measurement for use in supplier service contracts.

7  Uncertainty Measurement
7. 1  The measures of equipment reliability, availability,
and  maintainability  defined  in  Section  6  are  single
value estimates.  They do not indicate the uncertainty or
precision  of  the  estimate.    Precision  varies  depending
upon the number of failures observed and the amount of
productive   time   contained   within   the   observation
period.
7. 2    Precision  is  described  by  calculating  a  lower  and
upper  confidence  limit  for  the  MTBF
p
and  presenting
this interval along with the MTBF
p
point estimate.
7. 3  These  procedures  assume  that  the  failure  rate  is
constant     and     the     times     between     failures     are
independently  distributed  according  to  the  exponential
distribution.    Therefore,  there  are  no  improvement  or
degradation  trends  and  it  is  meaningful  to  calculate
MTBF
p
.    Section  8  applies  when  the  failure  times
indicate  that  a  non-constant  failure  rate  is  present  (for
example,    when    there    is    reliability    growth    or
degradation).    Section  8  would  typically  apply  during
prototype reliability improvement testing.
7. 4  Since MTTR distributions are unlikely to follow an
exponential   distribution   assumption,   applying   these
procedures to put confidence limits on MTTR would be
inappropriate.
7. 5    Note  that  all  procedures  and  tables  referred  to  in
this   section   apply   equally   well   to   measuring   the
precision  of  estimates  for  similar  metrics,  where  hours
are  replaced  by  cycles  or  units,  for  example.    These
procedures apply to E-MTBF
p
or E-MCBF in the same
way.    It  is  also  appropriate  to  combine  data  from
identical  tools  being  used  the  same  way,  in  order  to
improve the precision of MTBF
p
estimates.
7. 6  Calculation of Lower and Upper Confidence Limits
ó  To  obtain  lower  and  upper  MTBF
p
limits,  multiply
the  MTBF
p
estimate  by  factors  obtained  by  table  look-
up (Tables A1-1 and A1-2 in Appendix 1).  For the case
when  there  are  zero  failures  during  the  measurement
period,  lower  confidence  limit  factors  for  the  MTBF
p

are given in the first row of Table A1-1 (they multiply
the  amount  of  productive  time  that  had  no  failures  to
obtain  the  desired  MTBF
p
lower  limit).    There  is  no
upper  limit  estimate  for  performance  when  there  are
zero failures.
7. 6.1  Calculation  of  the  MTBF
p
Lower  Limit  ó  Use
Table  A1-1  in  Appendix  1  to  obtain  a  k
r;conf
factor,
where r  is  the  number  of  failures  observed  during  the
measurement  period  and  conf  is  the  confidence  level
desired.      The   rows   of   Table   A1-1   correspond   to
different  values  of  r  and  the  columns  correspond  to
different  values  of  conf.    Confidence  levels  ranging
from 80 percent to 95 percent are typical choices.
7. 6.1.1      Since   the   equipment   being   measured   has
demonstrated  (at  a  given  confidence  level)  that  it  is  at
least as good as the MTBF
p
lower limit, this lower limit
is  an  important  and  useful  performance  statistic,  and  is
often used contractually.
7. 6.1.2    Note  that  the  factors  in  Table  A1-1  for  90%
confidence are less than 0.5 until the number of failures
equals or exceeds 4.  This means that when the number
of  failures  is  under  4,  the  MTBF
P
lower  limit  will  be
less  than  half  the  MTBF
p
estimate,  and  confidence
intervals  will  be  wide.    From  the  point  of  view  of
precision,  it  is  advantageous  to  have  had  4  or  more
failures.
7. 6.1.3  Example:  During  a  given  calendar  quarter,  a
tool  was  productive  for  1200  hours  and  had  6  failures.
The  MTBF
p
estimate  is  1200/6  =  200  hours.  A  90
percent     lower     limit     factor     from     Table     A1-1
(corresponding  to  r =  6  failures)  is  0.570.    That  means
that  200  ◊  0.570  =  114.0  hours  is  a  90  percent  lower
confidence limit for the true tool MTBF
p
.
7. 6.2  Calculation  of  the  MTBF
p
Upper  Limit  ó  Use
Table  A1-2  in  Appendix  1  to  obtain  a  k
r;conf
factor,
where r  is  the  number  of  failures  observed  during  the
measurement  period  and  conf  is  the  confidence  level
desired.      The   rows   of   Table   A1-2   correspond   to
different  values  of  r  and  the  columns  correspond  to
different  values  of  conf.    Confidence  levels  ranging
from 80 percent to 95 percent are typical choices.
7. 6.2.1  Example:  During  a  given  calendar  quarter,  a
tool  was  productive  for  1200  hours  and  had  6  failures.
The  MTBF
p
estimate  is  1200/6  =  200  hours.    A  90
percent    upper    limit    factor    from    Table    A1-2
(corresponding  to  r =  6  failures)  is  1.904.    That  means
that  200  ◊  1.904  =  380.8  hours  is  a  90  percent  upper
confidence limit for the true tool MTBF
p
.
7. 6.3  Calculation   of   a   Confidence   Interval   for   the
MTBF
p
ó Lower and upper 100 ◊ (1 ñ α/2) confidence
limits for the MTBF
p
can be combined to give a 100 ◊
(1  ñ  α)  confidence  interval.    Here  α/2  is  the  chance  of
missing  on  either  end  of  the  interval.    A  90  percent
lower  limit  has  an  α/2  =  0.1  chance  of  not  being  low
enough to capture the true MTBF
p
, and the same is true
for  a  90  percent  upper  limit.    Therefore,  a  90  percent
lower  limit  and  a  90  percent  upper  limit  combine  to
give an 80 percent confidence interval.  Similarly, a 95
percent lower limit and a 95 percent upper limit would
combine to give a 90 percent confidence interval.
7. 6.3.1  Example: During a calendar quarter, a tool was
productive  for  1200  hours  and  had  6  failures.    The
MTBF
p
estimate is 1200/6 = 200 hours.  The 90 percent
lower  and  upper  limits  are  114  and  380.8  respectively
(see  Sections  7.6.1  and  7.6.2).    The  interval  (114,



SEMI E10-0304
E
© SEMI 1986, 2004 11
380. 8) is then an 80 percent confidence interval for the
true tool MTBF
p
.
7. 6.4  Calculation  of  the  MTBF
p
Lower  Bound  when
there  are  Zero  Failures  —  Use  the  first  row  of  Table
A1-1  (corresponding  to  r =  0)  to  obtain  a  k
0;conf
factor
corresponding to the desired confidence level.  Multiply
the  length  of  the  measurement  period  by  this  factor  to
obtain the lower limit estimate.
7. 6.4.1  Example: During a calendar quarter, a tool was
productive for 1200 hours and had zero failures.  From
Table A1-1, the 90% confidence level lower limit factor
is 0.434.  That means that 1200 ◊ 0.434 = 520.8 hours,
is  a  90%  lower  confidence  limit  estimate  for  the  true
tool MTBF
p
.
7. 6.5    Choosing  a  test  length  in  order  to  be  able  to
demonstrate  a  required  MTBF
p
at  a  given  confidence,
we  first  must  pick  a  maximum  number  of  failures,  r,
that can occur during the test period and still allow us to
confirm   a   required   MTBF
p
objective   at   a   given
confidence  level.    Next,  the  length  of  test  time  needed
can  be  calculated  using  the  factors  in  Table  A1-4  in
Appendix  1.    The  required  MTBF
p
is  multiplied  by  a
factor  based  on  r  and  the  desired  confidence  level  to
obtain the total test time needed.
7. 6.5.1    Note  that  minimum  test  times  are  obtained  by
allowing  no  failures.    The  cost,  however,  of  using  a
minimum test length is to increase the possibility of an
acceptable   tool   failing   the   test   by   chance.      As
mentioned  in  the  discussion  in  Section  6.2.1,  it  is
advantageous  to  design  a  test  that  allows  up  to  4
failures, whenever possible.
7. 6.5.2  Example:  We  would  like  to  confirm  a  tool
MTBF
p
of  400  hours  at  an  80%  confidence  level.  We
want to be able to pass a qualification test with 4 or less
failures.  We look up the appropriate factor from Table
A1-4 and find 6.72.  That means the length of test time
required is 400 ◊ 6.72 = 2688 hours.  We can do this on
one  tool  or  split  the  test  time  across  several  tools.
When we have accumulated 2688 hours and if 4 or less
failures  have  occurred,  the  MTBF
p
objective  of  400
hours  will  have  been  confirmed  at  (at  least)  the  80%
confidence level.
8  Reliability Growth or Degradation
Measurement
8. 1      The   previous   calculations   are   meaningful   only
when  the  MTBF
p
(or  MCBF)  and  E-MTBF
p
(or  E-
MCBF)  are  constant  over  the  measurement  period.    If
reliability    is    improving    (typical    during    design
verification  and  debug  and  also  early  life  run-in)  or  if
reliability  is  degrading  (typical  near  the  end  of  life  for
the  piece  of  equipment,  or  if  certain  sub-assemblies
have  been  over-stressed  and  are  wearing  out)  then  an
overall    MTBF
p
calculation    is    inappropriate    and
misleading  and  other  methods  must  be  used.    Exact
time  of  failure  recording  is  required  in  order  to  detect
reliability    improvement    or    reliability    degradation
trends, and to fit appropriate models.
8. 2  Exact Time of Failure Recording — Clock times of
failure  must  be  converted  to  durations  of  cumulative
productive time as measured from the initial productive
use   of   the   tool   (set   as   time   0).      This   is   easily
accomplished if total time is continuously monitored by
duration within each of the six equipment states.
8. 2.1  Example:  A  machine  is  intended  for  use  during
first  shift  operation  five  days  a  week.    For  simplicity,
assume  100%  productive  utilization.    After  the  first
three  weeks  of  use,  it  fails  half-way  through  the  day,
and  is  not  repaired  until  the  start  of  the  next  dayís
operation.  No more failures occur before the end of the
first four weeks of operation.  The exact time of failure
is 124 hours (three weeks of 5 ◊ 8 = 40 hours per week
plus half of an 8 hour day).  If a second failure occurred
two hours into the third day of the fifth week, the exact
time of failure would be 174 hours.
8. 3  Reliability   Growth   (Degradation)   Models   —   A
useful family of reliability growth (degradation) models
was  developed  by  the  U.S.  Army  Materials  Systems
Analysis    Activity.        These    AMSAA    models    are
described  in  Appendix  2,  along  with  a  general  test  for
reliability  growth  (degradation)  trends.    Exact  time  of
failure data is needed to test for trends, fit an AMSAA
model,  and  test  the  fit  for  adequacy.    The  failures  used
to  fit  the  model  must  occur  during  productive  time
(other  failures  can  occur,  but  these  are  not  used  to  fit
reliability models).

CONFIDENCE BOUND FACTORS
NOTICE:  This  appendix  was  approved  as  an  official  part  of  SEMI  E10  by  full  letter  ballot  procedure.  It  offers
detailed information related to Section 7.
A1-1  Introduction
A1-1.1  E-MTBF
p
may be substituted for MTBF
p
in all
calculations in this section.
A1-1.2      Tables   A1-1   and   A1-2   contain   factors   that
multiply  an  MTBF
p
point  estimate  to  obtain  upper  and
lower  confidence  limits.    Table  A1-1  applies  in  the
common  case  where  the  equipment  is  observed  for  a
fixed period of time and the number of failures that will
occur is unknown in advance (time censored data).  The
alternative  is  failure  censored  data,  where  the  number
of failures is specified in advance and the equipment is
observed  until  that  many  failures  occur.    Table  A1-3
contains  lower  limit  factors  for  failure  censored  data.
Since  failure  censored  data  rarely  occurs  in  tool  or
equipment  reliability  measurement,  Table  A1-3  is  only
included  for  completeness.    The  upper  limit  factors
given  in  Table  A1-2  apply  to  both  kinds  of  censored
data.
A1-1.3    Table  A1-4  can  be  used  to  plan  equipment
assessment  or  qualification  tests  in  order  to  be  able  to
demonstrate  a  desired  MTBF
p
at  a  given  confidence
level. In order to use Table A1-4, you must first choose
a  maximum  number  of  failures,  r,  you  might  observe
during  the  test  period  and  still  be  able  to  meet  the
required MTBF
p
objective.
A1-1.4    For  reference,  here  are  the  formulas  for  the
lower   and   upper   confidence   limit   factors   for   time
