A parameter can generally be thought of as a named, typed field that has a specificmeaning, utility or other information value. Examples are process control variables, equipment configurationsettings, measurement results, wafer maps, data variables, etc. Parameters can only be defined by an equipmentnode (Section 10.3 ), a SEMI ObjType (Section 10.9 ), or an exception (Section 10.7 ).10.4.2 Figure 9 shows how to describe named, typed parameters with units, constraints, and associations with otherparameters.

SEMI E125-0305 © SEMI 2003, 200517 10.4.9 Constraint Definition10.4.9.1 Parameter constraints describe restrictions on the valid values of Parameters. A constraint is documentedas a propositional formula, which evaluates TRUE with valid parameter values. Relational algebra defines a richsyntax for propositional formulas; however, this syntax is not commonly used for commercial applications.Standard Query Language (SQL) is a well-documented commercial application of relational algebra well suited tothis application. Specifically, the syntax of the WHERE clause (of the SQL SELECT statement) is suitable fordescribing constraints on Parameter values. The WHERE clause of the SQL SELECT statement is a propositional-expression that consists of one or more comparisons of values with constants. It has the following form.WHERE propositional-expression \[nested-propositional-expression\];For the purposes of this specification, a subset of the SQL WHERE syntax (the complete syntax is discussed inRelated Information, Section R2-1) shall be used to define constraints. Specifically, the IN, BETWEEN, and ISoperators are not supported in constraint definitions.10.4.9.2 For example, a Parameter named TemperatureSetpoint that represents a temperature set point that maynot be less than 100 or greater than 200 may be described using the following SQL WHERE clause.WHERE TemperatureSetpoint &gt; 100 AND TemperatureSetpoint &lt; 200;10.4.9.3 Describing Reporting Frequency Constraints10.4.9.3.1 To describe the rates at which a given Parameter can be reported for data acquisition, a specificconvention using the subset of the SQL WHERE clause described in Section 10.4.9.1 shall be used. For Parameterswhere this is a consideration, a constraint must be provided named ReportingPeriod. The definition of theReportingPeriod constraint shall take the following form:WHERE parameterName.ReportingPeriod comparison;10.4.9.3.2 Here, parameterName is the name of the Parameter to which the constraint applies, and comparison isany legal combination of terms, operators, or constants necessary to describe the constraint on valid reportingperiods for the Parameter. The time division for any constants that refer to the reporting period shall be in seconds.If the constraint definition is used to express an integer multiple of a fundamental reporting period, the variable nshall be used to represent the multiplier.10.4.9.3.3 For example, the constraint definition below specifies that the supported reporting period forTemperature is any continuous value between 0.01 seconds and 60 seconds. Additional examples are provided inRelated Information, Section R4-1.WHERE Temperature.ReportingPeriod &gt;.01 AND Temperature.ReportingPeriod &lt; 60;10.4.10 Describing SEMI Standard Variables and/or Attributes10.4.10.1 If the supplier is using a Parameter to represent variables or attributes that have been defined in a SEMIstandard, the name attribute of the Parameter class shall be equal to the name of the variable or attribute exactly as itis spelled, using the same case convention as found in the corresponding standard. The type mapping described inSection 10.5.4 shall determine the type assigned to the Parameter.

There aretwo primary classifications, read-only and read-write, that specify whether or not the parameters value can be set byan external entity. If read-only, the Parameter is classified as data. If read-write, there are several subclasses thatcan be used to further refine the description of the Parameters function.10.4.11.2 ParameterClassification  This class is the abstract base class for all Parameter classifications.10.4.11.3 ParameterClassification Attribute Definition TableTable 28 ParameterClassification Attribute DefinitionAttribute Name Definition FormisTransient Whether or not the Parameters value is onlyaccessible or meaningful under certainconditions. Boolean. See Section 10.4.11.3.1. 10.4.11.3.1 isTransient10.4.11.3.1.1 If false, the Parameters value is guaranteed to be accessible and meaningful at all times that theequipment is available and in a state in which it is possible to communicate with external entities. Parameters thatcorrespond to SEMI E30 equipment constants and status variables, for example, are non-transient.10.4.11.3.1.2 If true, the Parameter is said to be transient. The value of a transient Parameter is not guaranteed tobe accessible or meaningful except under certain conditions. For example, Parameters that correspond to SEMI E30data values are transient. Additionally, a Parameter may represent an attribute of a transient SEMI E39 ObjType,in which case its accessibility is determined by the lifecycle of the ObjType. The Parameter may provide data that isonly available when the equipment (or SEMI E39 ObjType) is in a specific state or states. If a transient Parameter isavailable for reporting with a specific event, its value may only be meaningful while the equipment is in the targetstate for which the event was reported. Or, the Parameters value may only be meaningful at the time the event

Providing a mechanism to describe the lifecycle for transient Parameters using metadata is beyond the scopeof this specification.10.4.11.4 ReadWrite  This abstract class identifies a Parameter as being settable by an external entity. Thesettings for such Parameters may influence the values or dynamics of other Parameters. For example, Parameterscorresponding to E30 equipment constants may be set by an external entity, and so would be classified asReadWrite. Parameters corresponding to E30 status variables or data values cannot be set by external entities,so would not be classified as ReadWrite.10.4.11.5 ReadWrite Association Definition TableTable 29 ReadWrite Association DefinitionAssociation Role Name Definition CommentsaffectedParameters A list of associated Parameters that are affectedby the settings of this Parameter.Unordered list of structured data, of typeAssociatedParameter. 10.4.11.5.1 affectedParameters10.4.11.5.1.1 If the Parameters settings directly affect the values or dynamics of other Parameters elsewhere in themetadata, an AssociatedParameter instance must be provided and described for each such relationship for theParameter being defined. Other generic associations may exist for the Parameter, but the specific associations thatarise from the settings of the Parameters value must be accessible through the affectedParameters associationprovided by this base class unless otherwise specified in this document.10.4.11.6 ReadOnly  This abstract class identifies a Parameter as being un-settable by an external entity. Itsvalue, however, is accessible to external entities. This class has no attributes or associations. For example,Parameters corresponding to E30 status variables or data values cannot be set by an external entity, and sowould be classified as ReadOnly. Parameters corresponding to E30 equipment constants can be set by externalentities, so could not be classified as ReadOnly.10.4.11.7 Data  This class is derived from ReadOnly, and identifies a Parameter as providing data values. If non-transient, (for example, Parameters corresponding to E30 status values), the data values are accessible andmeaningful at all times. If transient, (for example, Parameters corresponding to E30 data values), the data valuesare not guaranteed to be meaningful except when they are explicitly provided with the occurrence of specific eventsor, if they represent attributes of an SEMI E39 ObjType, when the corresponding ObjType has at least one activeinstance. This class defines no attributes or associations.10.4.11.8 Control  This is derived from ReadWrite, and identifies a Parameter as being settable by an externalentity (for example, Parameters corresponding to recipe settings). Changes in the values of a Control Parameteraffect the way in which the equipment processes, measures, or tests material and may affect the values of otherParameters. This class defines no attributes or associations.10.4.11.8.1 If other Parameters are affected by this Parameters settings, all such affected Parameters shall have acorresponding AssociatedParameter instance provided with the Control Parameters definition. Each suchAssociatedParameter instance shall be accessible via the affectedParameters association of this class (inheritedfrom ReadWrite).10.4.11.8.2 If non-transient, the values of this Parameter are accessible and meaningful at all times, and can be setby an external entity under conditions determined by the equipment.10.4.11.8.3 If transient, the values of this Parameter are not guaranteed to be meaningful or settable at all times. Ifthe Parameter represents an attribute of an SEMI E39 ObjType, the Parameter will only be settable when thecorresponding ObjType has at least one active instance.10.4.11.9 Configuration  This class is derived from ReadWrite, and identifies a Parameter as being settable by anexternal entity, and in some way influencing equipment behavior and/or the values of other Parameters, but is notconsidered a control Parameter (for example, E30 equipment constants used for configuring equipmentcommunication timeouts, etc.). This class defines no attributes or associations.

Each suchAssociatedParameter instance shall be accessible via the affectedParameters association of this class (inheritedfrom ReadWrite).10.4.11.9.2 If non-transient, the values of this Parameter are accessible and meaningful at all times, and can be setby an external entity under conditions determined by the equipment.10.4.11.9.3 If transient, the values of this Parameter are not guaranteed to be meaningful or settable at all times.

Parameter typedefinitions can be re-used elsewhere in the metadata wherever a Parameters type can be declared. See RelatedInformation Section R5-1 for some examples using the ParameterTypeDefinition class.

For example, a Parameter TypeDefinition could define a re-usable Parameter typenamed KelvinTemperature of type RealType, with Kelvin units and 4 digits of precision. A composite parameterTypeDefinition can be a named Array, Enumeration, or Structure. Each kind of primitive and composite Parametertype is described fully in subsequent sections of this document. ParameterTypeDefinition can be re-used in thedefinition of other ParameterTypeDefinitions, recursively within the same ParameterTypeDefinition, and in thedefinition of Parameters (see Section 10.4 ).10.5.1.3 The primitive Parameter type description classes are defined in Section 10.5.2 ; composite type descriptionclasses are defined in Section 10.5.3 .10.5.1.3.1 ParameterTypeDefinition Attribute Definition TableTable 30 ParameterTypeDefinition Attribute DefinitionAttribute Name Definition Required Formname The name for the re-usable type definition.

Foreach independently configurable set of units available, the equipment shall support one non-transient unitconfiguration Parameter to control which units are used when communicating the values of such Parameters. TheParameterType of such unit configuration Parameters shall be a string-based enumeration (see Section 10.5.4.1.3 ).Each value in the enumeration shall correspond to a different unit configuration. Figure 13 shows the classes usedto describe configurable units. Not all associations and attributes of the Unit, Parameter, ParameterTypeDefinition,ParameterType, and EnumerationType classes are shown for clarity.NOTE 2: The equipment is not required to support configurable units in order to comply with E125; however if the equipmentdoes support configurable units, it shall describe the available units and their configuration using the classes defined in thissection.10.5.2.9 The UnitConfig class (shown in Figure 13) is used to provide a mapping from each possible unit choice fora given numeric ParameterType to the enumeration Parameter setting that selects that unit. For example, theequipment may provide a single unit configuration Parameter to select between meter-kilogram-seconds (mks),centimeter-gram-seconds (cgs), and English units.

Figure 14 showshow to describe the type of the elements in a given array. An array can refer to only one of the primitive orcomposite types, and can declare that it has a maximum number of elements. For example, an array description thathas a maxElements value of 0 and refers to the RealType primitive type represents an array of real numbers (forexample, float or double) that has no limitation on the number of values it can contain.10.5.3.1.2 Each element of an array must represent the same physical concept. For example, an array of realnumbers must not be used to represent a repeating sequence of a measured value in odd-numbered elements and theuncertainty for the measurement in even-numbered elements. In such cases, an array of StructureType elements isthe correct representation, where the different concepts appear as different fields in the structure (for example, ameasurement field and an uncertainty field). A human-readable description of the meaning of the array elements isrequired.

These classes can be used to describe standardized state machines, such asthose originating from SEMI standards, as well as non-standardized equipment-specific state machines. Examplesof state machines are provided in Related Information, Section R7-1.10.8.1.1.1 The state machine description classes specified here are intended for descriptive purposes in facilitatingend-user understanding of equipment behavior that results in the generation of events. They are not intended toprovide comprehensive modeling of all semantics defined by standard state machine formalisms such as Harel orUML. Events generated by the equipment must be defined within the context of these state machine descriptions,even if the described state machine has not been literally implemented by the supplier. Further, this specificationdoes not require the supplier to provide a literal implementation of the state machines described by these classes.10.8.1.2 A StateMachine that defines behavior that is implemented by many equipment components (for example)need only be defined once. Each component that implements the behavior described by that StateMachine can thenrefer to the events it defines through the use of the StateMachineInstance class (see Section 10.8.6). It is notnecessary to define multiple StateMachines to accommodate multiple components that each exhibit the samebehavior and generate the same events. For example, if the equipment being described has four pump componentsthat exhibit the same behavior, have the same underlying StateMachine, and generate the same set of events, onlyone StateMachine description is necessary. Each pump component can then act as a different source (see Section10.3.1 ) of the same set of events defined for that StateMachine, each pump executing the StateMachineindependently of the other pumps.10.8.2 StateMachine  This class represents a collection of states and transitions that together comprise a non-concurrent finite state machine. All StateMachines refer to a single top-level state. The top-level state can containzero or more substates and/or StateMachines.

When appearing as a member of the stateMachines association of the State class, the StateMachine classcan be used to describe 2 or more concurrent state machines belonging to that State instance.

Each Event can reference one or moretransitions. This is in support of systems or standards that use the same event id to communicate differenttransitions. Such implementations typically make additional data available with the event occurrence fordistinguishing between the different transitions. Note that it is not possible for two different events to be defined forthe same transition.10.8.6 State Machine Instances10.8.6.1 State machines are intended to be defined once and re-used wherever there is an equipment component orother entity that can generate the same set of events defined by that state machine.

SEMI E125.1-0305 © SEMI 2005 4 1 Purpose1.1 SOAP Implementation Mapping1.1.1 The purpose of this specification is to provide an implementation mapping of the SEMI E125 specification tothe SOAP 1.1 protocol. This document provides a description of the XML Schema data types used to support theUML classes defined in SEMI E125, and also describes the WSDL port type and binding definitions used to supportthe operations defined by the interfaces specified in SEMI E125. 2 Scope2.1 Specification Scope2.1.1 The scope of this specification is the representation of the EqSD model in an XML Schema and correspondingWSDL port types and bindings. It will not add new domain information or concepts to the SEMI E125 model. Theonly additions made are those needed to render useful WSDL or XML Schema.2.1.2 This specification requires SEMI E132 authentication, and defines requirements for the application of SEMIE132 concepts to the SEMI E125 specification.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 Provisional Specification3.1.1 This specification is provisional pending the approval of the SEMI E138, SEMI E120.1 and SEMI E132.1.This specification relies on XML Schema types defined by each of these specifications, and cannot be fullyimplemented without these types. Finalization of these specifications is a condition for the removal of theprovisional status of this document.3.1.2 This specification is provisional pending approval of the SEMI specification for Units for the SemiconductorIndustry. This specification relies on the unit of measure symbols defined in that specification. Finalization of thisspecification is a condition for the removal of the provisional status of this document. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E121  Guide for Style & Usage of XML for Semiconductor Manufacturing ApplicationsSEMI E120.1  XML Schema for the Common Equipment ModelSEMI E132.1  Specification for SOAP Binding of Equipment Client Authentication and AuthorizationSEMI E125  Specification for Equipment Self Description (EqSD)4.2 OMG Standards1 Unified Modeling Language (UML) Specification, Version 1.4, OMG Specification 01-09-67,(http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/modeling\_spec\_catalog.htm)4.3 W3C Standards2 Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)  W3C, 6 October 2000(http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006/) 1 Object Management Group, Inc., 250 First Ave. Suite 100, Needham, MA 02494, USA, Telephone:1.781.444.0404, Fax: 1.781.444.0320,website: www.omg.org.2 World Wide Consortium, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), 32Vassar Street Room 32-G515, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA Telephone: 1.617.253.2613 Fax: 1.617.258.5999, website: www.w3c.org.
