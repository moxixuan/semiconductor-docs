SEMI F97-0305 © SEMI 200511 9.4.5.3 The locked sub state of Run and Stand-by may be used in order to force the FPU to maintain the current Runor Stand-by state until the lock is disabled. The reasons causing the lock are out of scope of this standard. Inaddition to the trigger to unlock, only critical failures can cause the FPU to leave the locked sub state. These criticalfailures are being defined on a case by case basis by the purchaser and supplier of the FPU and the systemintegrator.

SEMI F98-0305 © SEMI 20051 SEMI F98-0305GUIDE FOR TREATMENT OF REUSE WATER IN SEMICONDUCTORPROCESSING This guide was technically approved by the Global Facilities Committee and is the direct responsibility of theNorth American Facilities Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on December 10, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org February 2005; to be publishedMarch 2005. 1 Purpose1.1 This guide establishes definitional requirements for industrial water systems that reuse water in a semiconductormanufacturing facility. It is intended to establish a common basis for developing detailed specifications insubsequent documents concerning design, performance, optimization, and monitoring of such systems.1.2 This document may be used by users and suppliers as a basis for developing site-specific specifications andperformance criteria. 2 Scope2.1 This guide applies to water systems designed for reuse of water including reclaim and recycle, used insemiconductor manufacturing facilities, supplying water to a variety of uses. Such uses include directing waters tothe front end of a UPW system, to cooling systems, scrubbers, thermal processes, and to irrigation systems,depending on the quality of the water.2.2 This guide can be used to understand the design elements and functionality of water systems that support reuseof water. Although such systems can be retrofitted into existing manufacturing factories, there is a broader range ofopportunities available in new facilities that can be designed with water saving applications in mind.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 This guide does not define the actual specifications generally negotiated between the user and the manufacturerof the reclaim or recycle system.3.2 This guide does not address the methodology for optimizing the reuse of spent rinse waters.3.3 This guide does not address the frequency or scope of ongoing maintenance for reuse water systems includingchange-out of resin beds and replacement of filters.3.4 This guide does not describe the broad range of possible reuse opportunities and the associated water qualityrequired for each.3.5 This guide does not intend to cover any of the important safety considerations that relate to the properinstallation, operation, or maintenance of a reuse water system. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E49  Guide for High Purity and Ultrahigh Purity Piping Performance, Subassemblies, and Final AssembliesSEMI F63  Guide for Ultrapure Water System Used in Semiconductor ProcessingSEMI S2  Environmental, Health, and Safety Guideline for Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment

Properventing is also critical to correct operation. The system may also include a reclaim pit, pumps, tanks, and controls.Separate holding tanks are used for each grade of water or type of waste stream so that routing of waste and types oftreatment can be matched to specific needs (see Figure 1).6.1.1 A key consideration for the design of a water reuse system is the ability to separate different grades of waterand collect each type of effluent. Typical types of segregation include: segregation of clean rinse water from acidwaste; separation of waste streams that contain organics, (e.g. from IPA drying); and isolation of waste streams thatrequire specific treatment such as for hydrofluoric acid, CMP processing, copper solutions, or phosphoric acid.6.1.2 A recent initiative by semiconductor fabs encourages tool manufacturers to include multiple drain lines withinthe tool so that waste streams can be easily segregated. Diverter valves can be used to segregate chemicals and arealso useful when organics exceed recommended levels. Tool manufacturers can also incorporate plumbing andtreatment modules for returning spent water discharged from a tool as feed water for that tool (Point of Discharge\[POD\] recycling). Purchasing tools with recycle hardware already built-in eliminates the need for users to designand install customized water reuse systems unique to their site.6.2 Treatment of Waste Streams  In addition to choosing the most effective and technically sound design choices,other considerations for treatment choices include easy access to all major components for operations andmaintenance, availability of consumables and spare parts, and a high level of automation and reliability. There areseveral choices related to treatment choices:6.2.1 TOC (total oxidizable carbon) destruction by UV is commonly used for removal of organics found in reclaimwaters and is sometimes combined with ozone or hydrogen peroxide.6.2.2 Activated Carbon or other adsorbents (e.g. GAC) are used for removal of organics and decomposedhydrogen peroxide, and is a common type of treatment in recycle water systems.6.2.3 Electrodeionization (EDI) enables ion exchange reactions to be carried out continuously, without off-lineregeneration, by introducing a dc electric field across the resin bed. This electric filed is oriented transverse to thedirection of water flow through the ion exchange column. Under the influence of the applied electric field, impurityions, chemically captured by the ion exchange reactions, drift from resin bead to neighboring resin bead and 1 International SEMATECH, 2706 Montopolis Drive, Austin, TX 78741, USA, Website: www.sematech.org

SEMI F98-0305 © SEMI 20053 ultimately through a semipermeable membrane that isolates the feed water channel from adjacent circulating waterflows (concentrate channels) that sweep away the impurities entering through the semipermeable membranes.This continuous regeneration action eliminates the need to take ion exchange columns off-line for resin regenerationand also eliminates the need for storing regeneration chemicals on site.6.2.4 Reverse Osmosis Membrane Treatment provides extremely high rejection of dissolved ions (charged atomsand molecules), organic (carbon containing) compounds, silica (silicon containing) compounds, and virtuallycomplete rejection of suspended contaminants, but will not reject dissolved gases and volatile organic compounds aswell. For reclaim systems, special types of high rejection or low fouling RO membranes may be selected.6.2.5 Often RO Systems are combined with ion exchange processes either with the purpose of increasing therecovery rate of the RO or by combining the high efficiency of a membrane process with the lower fouling potentialof ion exchange resins, e.g. Weakly Acidic Cation Resin (WAC) is designed to remove Ca and Mg ions in thewater. The system design should reflect that most of the contaminants of rinse waters are anionic in nature and mayfoul RO membranes, but recycling water may be mixed with other water qualities and may therefore containhardness, which can react with the Fluoride of the recycling water.6.2.6 Biological processes are used to treat water with higher organic contents. They can be either fixed bedsystems or fluidized bed systems. These processes typically require both upstream and downstream processes, suchas neutralization, and maintaining a stable feed concentration for the biological process upstream and removal ofbacteria downstream. The operation of such systems is quite sensitive, but most of the organics used insemiconductor manufacturing can be treated by such systems, including TMAH and chemicals used for lithographyand stripping.6.2.7 Other Treatment  Includes microfiltration, ultrafiltration, and other types of water treatment typically usedto protect RO Membranes. Pretreatment equipment may include media filtration (bulk suspended solids removal),15 micron cartridge filtration (polishing step for suspended solids removal), sodium-cycle cation exchange(softening, to remove scale-forming cations), acid injection (to minimize cellulose acetate membrane damage and/orto control carbonate scales), scale inhibitor injection (to control scaling), and sulfite ion injection (to removeoxidizing agents).6.3 Monitoring  TOC, pH, conductivity, and temperature are typical parameters that can be monitored on-lineand tracked over time to optimize performance. The set points and level of monitoring depends on the chemistriesbeing used and what the ionic and organic loads are in each waste stream after the application and the treatment. Toensure the accuracy of certain on-line measurements, a minimum residence time and volume of sample is requiredand can be provided through the use of a buffer station and separate sample tanks. Other parameters such as fluoridelevels, specific organics, and oxidants from undeveloped ammonia must be measured in the laboratory. 7 Grades of Water Effluent7.1 Rinse Water  The second and third rinses from wafer cleaning processes are sufficiently high quality to bereused without further treatment either for make-up water in a UPW system, or directly for use in a lower gradeapplication such as CMP cleaning.7.2 Non-treated Reclaim Water  Is a lower grade of water with possible applications including fab air pollutionabatement scrubbers, fab point-of-use hazardous gas burn boxes, and drain flushing for CMP drains. 8 Special Issues8.1 Difficulty of Identifying and Treating Organics  It is difficult to evaluate rinse waters after solvent use. Realtime, on-line instruments are not available to easily quantify and identify the complete composition of the organicmolecules for proper segregation. In addition, treatment of waste water containing organics is more difficult insome cases, depending on the organic molecules being removed or converted.8.2 Managing Excursions  Excursions in reuse water quality can occur due to various reasons such as humanerror in operating non-automated manufacturing equipment.8.2.1 It is important to detect and redirect such water before it can contaminate the system for which it directed forreuse or possibly even damage the treatment equipment. Excursions from organics are particularly difficult becausethey cannot be detected in real time. Two methods have been used to compensate for this delay: locate the

&lt;!-- Page 21 --&gt;

SEMI F98-0305 © SEMI 2005 4 analyzers at a sufficient distance upstream of the central diverter point, or provide a sufficient buffer/quarantinevolume.8.3 Temperature  Hot water effluent from rinse tanks on wet benches can provide a challenge in recyclingtreatment systems, as temperature can be an important variable to water recycling system performance and can causean increase in bacteria growth. This issue is influenced by seasonal variations in ambient temperature. Heatexchangers for process waters can be added to a recycle system in order to keep the system at a steady state.8.4 Discharge Permits  One aspect of water reuse that can have significant economic impact relates to siteeffluent and local discharge permits. As water reuse increases, contaminant concentrations in the site effluent willalso increase due to the reduced volume of the wastewater. If site water reuse is great enough, these higherconcentrations may approach the limits of the local wastewater discharge permits and need to be closely monitored. 9 Economic Considerations9.1 General  Potential cost savings are available from the introduction of reuse water systems. One type ofsavings can be measured from the actual cost of the water being replaced. The cost savings depends on the grade ofwater being replaced and the original cost of producing that grade of water at that location. Additional savings canoften be realized in maintenance costs (e.g. membrane cleaning) given that the reclaim water is generally of betterquality than incoming water. Models for evaluating the economics of a reclaim or recycle water application havebeen developed in the industry.

As long as the test conditions arereported with the result, any combination of chemicalreagents with any concentration can be used for the test. The test conditions should reflect actual processconditions which are specific for the Flat Panel Displaymanufacturers. Some reagents suggested for the test areprovided in Related Information 1 as a reference.7.2 This standard may involve hazardous materials,operations, and equipment. This standard does notpurport to address all of the safety problems associatedwith its use. It is the responsibility of the user of thisstandard to establish appropriate safety and healthpractices and determine the applicability of regulatorylimitations prior to use. 8 Sample Preparation8.1 Prepare at least a specimen from a lot of thesubstrates to be tested. The specimen is a rectangularplate about 25  50 mm edge length for Methods A andB, or 40  40 mm edge length for Method C.8.1.1 If they are not already chamfered, specimenedges and corners should be chamfered slightly toremove chips and prevent cracking. If repeated tests areexpected, prepare an appropriate quantity of testspecimens.8.2 Measure edge lengths of the test specimens, andcalculate total surface area, A: A = (L  W  2) + &#123;(L + W )  T  2)&#125; (1)whereL = one edge length of test specimen in cm,W = adjacent edge length of test specimen in cm,T = thickness of test specimen in cm, andA = total surface area of test specimen in cm 2 . 8.3 Clean all test specimens by a method appropriatefor the history of the material. The cleaning methodshould not cause any corrosion. Clean the specimens byan appropriate neutral or alkali detergent forapproximately 10 minutes using an ultrasonic bath.8.3.1 Rinse them continuously in a stream of deionizedwater, having a conductivity of less than 1  S/cm, for 1minute using the ultrasonic bath. Finally, dry them.8.4 Place all specimens on a clean heat resistant sampleholder.

SEMI D10-95 © SEMI 1995, 20033 material durable to the test media and conditions. (Wax,varnish, epoxy resins, adhesive tape, etc., may be used.) 9 Procedure9.1 Test Specimen Processing9.1.1 Prepare cylindrical wide-mouthed sealablevessels, sample holders, etc., made of materials whichdo not react with the test medium under the testconditions. Use a reaction vessel in which the testspecimen, while on the sample holder, is sufficientlyimmersed in the required volume of test reagent.9.1.2 Place the test specimen on the sample holder withspacing of 1 to 2 cm between the test specimen andbottom of the empty vessel. When a part of thespecimen is coated by protective material, position thesample so that its coated portion faces down. The testspecimen may be leaned against the vessel wall if thetest is to be done in relatively brief or slightly corrosiveconditions, or in concentrated, extremely corrosivemedia.9.1.3 Pour the test reagents into the reaction vessel.Volume of the test medium shall be 5 to 10 ml per cm2of specimen surface area. Preheat the test medium tothe specified test temperature.9.1.4 Place the reaction vessel in the preheated shakerbath with specified shaking stroke and frequency. Closethe reaction vessel loosely, and expose the specimen atspecified temperature for specified time.9.1.5 At the completion of specified test time,immediately remove the reaction vessel from the shakerbath. Remove the test specimens from the reactionvessel using soft forceps, and rinse the specimensimmediately by deionized water at appropriatetemperature. When the specimen temperature is highfollowing this process, rinse the specimens completelywith water of gradually decreasing temperature. Finishit by deionized water at room temperature. Less cautionis required when the reaction temperature is low. Asynthetic rubber or plastic glove may be used instead offorceps if sufficient care is taken. In all cases, thesurface of the test specimen shall not be scrubbed.Never dry the test specimen during this operation.Generation of cracks or chips due to thermal ormechanical shocks should be avoided.9.1.6 For Method B samples, remove coating byappropriate non-corrosive method, and clean samplesagain. In this case, residue from the coating materialshould not contaminate the overall test specimen.9.1.7 Place the test specimens on a clean heat-resistantsample holder, and dry them at 140 ± 10°C for 30minutes. 9.1.8 Place the specimens in the desiccator and allowthem to cool to room temperature.9.2 Measurement Method9.2.1 Method A (Weight Change)9.2.1.1 Weigh the test specimen to 0.1 mg or 0.01 mgas required, using the balance.9.2.1.2 Calculate the areal weight change with thefollowing equation. WA = W2  W1A (2)whereW1 = the initial weight of the test specimen in mg,W2 = weight of the test specimen in mg after the test,A = is surface area of test specimen in cm 2 ,as calculated in 8.2, andWA = the areal weight change, in mg  cm -2 . NOTE 2: A negative result indicates a real weight loss, and apositive result indicates a real weight gain.9.2.1.3 Calculate penetration depth of corrosion, P, ofthe test sample by the following equation. P = 10WAD (3)whereWA = the areal weight change in mg cm -2D = the density of the substrate material in mg cm -3(see 9.2.1.4) andP = penetration depth in m NOTE 3: A negative result indicates loss of material, and apositive result indicates material gain.9.2.1.4 When density of the materials is unknown, usethe value measured by the method described in ASTMC729.9.2.2 Method B (Profilometry)9.2.2.1 Measure the height, H, in m, of the stepbetween the unetched (coated) section and the etched(uncoated) section by a calibrated surface profilometer.Trace length shall be between 2 and 4 mm, with theboundary between the two sections located near thecenter of the trace.Repeat this measurement at least 3 times.9.2.2.2 Calculate the average penetration depth P: P = H1 + H2 +      + HNN (4)

&lt;!-- Page 44 --&gt;

SEMI D10-95 © SEMI 1995, 2003 4 NOTE 4: A negative result indicates loss of material, andpositive result indicates material gain.9.2.3 Method C (Surface Haze)9.2.3.1 Measure total transmittance, Tt, and diffusetransmittance, Td, and calculate the haze value from thefollowing expression: H = TdTt  100 (5)whereTt = total transmittance,Td = diffuse transmittance, andH = haze value in %. 10 Reporting Results10.1 Report date and time of test, ambient temperature,test operator, test conditions (reagent and concentration,volume of the test medium, test temperature, test time,stroke length, and frequency of shaking), specimen sizeand total surface area, specimen cleaning method, andthe following:10.1.1 Method A  The areal weight change (W A), theinitial weight of the specimen (W 1), the density of thesubstrate material (D), and calculated depth ofcorrosion (P).10.1.1.1 Method B  Penetration depth (P).10.1.1.2 Method C  The average, maximum andminimum value of total transmittance (Tt), diffusetransmittance (Td), and haze value (H).10.2 Remarks  In a typical test, one specimen isimmersed in an unused medium of specified volume ina reaction vessel during a specified time. However, aslong as various conditions are described in the report, even irregular methods may be allowed. Repetitiveusage of a medium may not markedly affect the resultwhen the test is done in relatively brief or slightlycorrosive conditions, or in concentrated, extremelycorrosive media. 11 Precision and Accuracy11.1 Interlaboratory evaluation of these test methods isplanned to verify their suitability and reliability. Untilthe results are established, use of this test method forcommercial transactions is not recommended unless theparties to the test establish the degree of correlation thatcan be obtained.11.2 No standards exist against which any bias of thistest method can be evaluated.NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties orrepresentations as to the suitability of the standards setforth herein for any particular application.
