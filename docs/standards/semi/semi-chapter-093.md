SEMI D41-0305 © SEMI 20051 SEMI D41-0305MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITYINSPECTION This standard was technically approved by the Global Flat Panel Display - Factory Committee and is thedirect responsibility of Japanese Flat Panel Display Factory Automation Committee. Current editionapproved by the Japan Regional Standards Committee on November 24, 2004. Initially available atwww.semi.org January 2005; to be published March 2005. 1 Purpose1.1 This standard will define the application of the formula derived in SEMI D31 to various test conditions closedto visual inspection for MURA in FPD image quality inspection.1.2 SEMI D31 has derived a formula to detect defects and blemishes in FPD in comparison with human eyes andCCD based instruments.1.3 In general the difficulty of implementing instruments to replace human inspector lays on human factor variationwith its origin and location. 2 Scope2.1 This standard is applicable to FPDs. This standard mainly deals with both the measurement method of Semuand the revised definition of Semu. The target display size is typically from 8(20.3cm) to 30(76.2cm) diagonal.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 In this standard, the target of measurement, Mura, is limited as below.3.2 Line defects narrower than a pixel and pixel dot defects are not the subject of this standard. In this issue, thisstandard follows SEMI D31.3.3 In this standard, it is dealt with monochrome displays like gray scale patterns in color patterns.

This standard indicates level 32 out of 64 level gray scale.5.3.3 L0 Display  gradation 0 out of 64. (Pitch Black)5.3.4 L63 Display  gradation 63 out of 64 (Completely white)5.3.5 Luminance Accuracy  the error ratio of the luminance.5.3.6 Measuring points  the number of CCD sensors.5.3.7 Semu  Semi Mura, Measurement index for Mura, defined in this standard. Please refer toSEMI D31.5.3.8 Viewing direction  the angle between the CCD equipment and the test sample. 6 Related Definitions for Mura Measurement6.1 Mura is a Japanese term meaning blemish and has been adopted in English to provide a name for imperfectionsof the display pixel matrix surfaces that are visible when the display is in operation. Inspect the display surfacewhile displaying a white full screen, a black full screen, and a dark gray full screen (VESA FPDM 2.0). In manycase, the Mura phenomena is detected by human eyes. But this is very confusing in the quality aspect. And it is verydifficult to quantify the level.6.2 The definition in SEMI D31 shows mainly that Luminance Mura is related with the size of Mura. Therefore thisstandard will follow the Cjnd concept.6.3 Semu Definition6.3.1 Under specific conditions, the below regression function can explain the level of Mura between the area andcontrast for Human Mura JND. (Refer to SEMI D31.)Cjnd = F (Sjnd) = 1.97/Sjnd 0.33 + 0.72Cjnd: Contrast of Mura at JND(Unit: % relative to background = 100%)Sjnd: The area of Mura at above contrast (Units: mm2)6.3.2 In the above equation, contrast at JND is inversely proportional to the area raised to the 0.33 powers. In short,it indicates that as Mura the area gets smaller, only darker Mura can be sensed.6.3.2.1 For the subject Mura, the Mura level, Semu, can be calculated using the below formula.Semu = |Cx| / Cjnd= |Cx| / F (Sx)= |Cx| /(1.97/Sx0.33 + 0.72)Cx: Average contrast of Mura being measured (Unit: % relative to background = 100%)Sx: The surface area of Mura being measured (mm2) 7 Measurement Method7.1 Environment Conditions: Temperature: 25 ± 2°C Humidity: 65 ± 20% RH Illumination of surrounding: in a dark room below 10 lux Air flow: no wind

SEMI D41-0305 © SEMI 20053 7.2 Measurement Method7.2.1 Warm-Up Time7.2.1.1 Warm-up time is the period from power-on to saturation of the light intensity. The optical measurementneeds 15 to 30 minutes for more accurate measurement. In case of Mura, it has a little luminance difference betweenthe luminance of Mura and the luminance of background the area. Therefore it must be measured in a saturate state. Figure 1General Warm-Up Characteristics 7.2.2 Light Measurement Device (LMD)7.2.2.1 When human eyes measure the FPD, it is detected in the total active area. So the measuring equipmentsmust have similar characteristics to the human eye detecting method. In this standard, we recommend the CCDequipments to detect the Mura phenomena.1) Dynamic Range  The dynamic range of the CCD equipment should be over 12 bits because the Semu valuemust be controlled by 0.1 Semu.2) Luminance Accuracy  The Accuracy of Luminance is very important to measure Mura, because the Muravalue is determined by low luminance difference. Therefore the accuracy of luminance should be ±0.01 cd/m2at the 100cd/m2.3) Measuring Points  The measuring points should be over 200(H) X 200(V) points. It is the same as thenumber of the CCD sensors.7.2.3 Test Pattern for Semu Measurement7.2.3.1 The test pattern should be set by 50 cd/m2 in the white pattern. The permissible error is 10 cd/m2.7.2.4 Viewing Direction7.2.4.1 The viewing direction angle should be set 90° ± 1°. 90° ± 1° DUT LMD Measuring Distance Figure 2Viewing Direction for the Semu Measurement

We standardizethe 15 display size and testing distance is 500 mm. But the testing distance should be different from each displaysize.7.2.5.2 In case of the 15 display, the angle from the center to the edge position can be calculated below. )4.(..........\_5.0\_tan distanceMeasuringdistancediagonal = Therefore the reference angle is about 20.856° and then it can be calculated the measuring distance of all DUT. )5...(tan5.0\_\_= distancediagonaldistanceMeasuring Table 1 Examples of Measuring DistanceDisplay Size(in.)14.1 15 17 18.1 20.1 Measuring Distance(mm)470 mm 500 mm 566 mm 603 mm 670 mm #1 This measuring distance can have the same measuring angle in each different size sample. 7.2.6 Determination of the Threshold for the Mura Area7.2.6.1 It is very important to calculate the Semu value. If some threshold values are different from each testequipment, the Semu test results are different. Therefore we use the Cx value to determine the threshold value. Inthis standard, when the Cx value is over 1.01, we can consider the Mura area.7.2.7 Area Calculation Method7.2.7.1 There are two main parameters for calculating the Semu value. The first one is the Cx value and the other isthe Sx value. The Sx value means that the surface area of Mura being measured. We can calculate the size of Muraarea with counting the number of pixels under the CCD equipment test.7.2.8 Test Sample Pattern for the Sample Test7.2.8.1 Originally, the test pattern should be set by 50 cd/m2 in the white pattern. And the permissible error is 10cd/m2. But we use some artificial Mura test patterns for checking the sensitivity of the Semu parameter. The testpattern has 10 Muras in Figure 3. Each Mura has a different gray level. In Figure 3, the left one shows darker Murapatterns, and the right one shows brighter Mura patterns. Figure 3Test Patterns for Mura7.2.9 Test Results for the Sample Patterns7.2.9.1 Table 2 shows that the actual results for the darker Mura test pattern and Table 3 is for the brighter Murapattern.

The incomplete sections are noted as To Be Determined.The Gases Committee has agreed to publish this section prior to completion as a service to the SemiconductorIndustry.This specification was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility ofthe North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional StandardsCommittee on February 28, 1999. Initially available at www.semi.org April 1999; to be published June1999. Originally published in 1986; previously published in 1995. 1 Preface1.1 Recognizing the importance of impurity content ofgases in the manufacture of semiconductors, suppliersresponded by introducing products with improvedanalytical characterization, notably for trace impurities.1.2 The SEMI Gases Committee b egan its efforts inthe spring of 1979. With this publication, theCommittee establishes the definitions, generalprocedures, specifications, and analytical proceduresfor the gases listed in the index.1.3 Products which meet all of the requirements maybe described as meeting SEMI specifications.1.4 Where an analytical procedure different from thatprovided is substituted by a supplier or user, the burdenof proof is on said supplier or user to confirm theequivalency. It should be noted that the following list ofcriteria was considered when determining the specifiedanalytical method.ReliabilityEase of UseMaintenancePrecisionAccuracySensitivityVersatilityAvailability of Equipment 1.5 The specifications provided by this work areintended to serve for gases to be used in themanufacture and processing of semiconductors andadvanced electronic devices and circuits. Thespecifications and the associated test procedures areguidelines based on the experience of suppliers andusers. The function of the specifications is to establishdesired standards of quality.1.6 Where feasible, a specification of content shall beexpressed as a numerical limit in units of mole per mole(mole/mole). 1.7 For a major component, the va lue (assay or purity)shall be expressed as a minimum permissible limit. Foran impurity, the value shall be expressed as a maximumpermissible limit.1.8 A gas conforming to the specif ications willcommonly contain more of the major component thanthe minimum permissible limit or contain less of animpurity (or several impurities) than the SEMI C3maximum permissible limit. In neither case shall thegas be considered as of higher quality than that definedby the specification.1.9 It is not practical to consider e very impurity orcontaminant that might be present. For certainapplications, it is recognized that more stringent oradditional specifications and procedures might berequired.

Thevaporized sample is withdrawn as a gas for analyticalpurposes.4.2.4 Theory  The sampler is used to isolate a smallbut representative quantity of cryogenic liquid andvaporize the major component and all volatileimpurities to form a homogeneous gas sample suitablefor analysis. The cryogenic liquid is used to cool ashielding space and sampling cup prior to admitting theliquid to the sampling cup. The purpose of pre-coolingthe sampling cup is to prevent concentrating impuritieswhich could result when the warm cup causes the liquidto vaporize, leaving behind impurities with higherboiling points.4.2.4.1 When the cup is adequately co oled, thesampling valve is opened, allowing liquid to fill thecup. When the sampling valve is closed, the liquid istrapped in the cup and will vaporize as a result ofatmospheric heating. Once the sample is trapped, theflow of liquid is stopped.4.2.5 Preparation for Sampling4.2.5.1 The sample should be kept in t he same productservice to avoid sample contamination. If a productchange is required, always thoroughly purge thesampler or evacuate to 100 microns prior to taking thesample.4.2.5.2 When taking the sample, the s ampler is toremain secured to the bottom half of the case andMUST be in an upright position.

SAMPLINGSHOULD BE DONE ONLY IN WELLVENTILATED AREAS. 4.2.6.3 Relieve pressure in vessel thro ugh vents indust caps by cautiously opening inlet sampling valve.4.2.6.4 When gauge indicates atmosph eric pressureand flow ceases, close inlet sampling valve and removedust caps.4.2.6.5 Connect fill hose to supply tan k and inletfittings of sampler.4.2.6.6 Open supply tank outlet valve. Gas and liquidwill begin to flow from the sampler outlet.CAUTION: WHEN OXYGEN IS SAMPLED,SOME ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS MUST BEOBSERVED. IF THERE IS NO FACILITY SUCHAS A CLEAN CONCRETE PAD ON WHICH THELIQUID OXYGEN CAN EVAPORATE SAFELY,IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO CATCH THELIQUID OXYGEN IN A CLEAN, PREFERABLYSEAMLESS ALUMINUM BUCKET. USE A LINEWITH MINIMUM INSIDE DIAMETER OF ONE-HALF INCH TO DIRECT THE LIQUID OXYGENINTO THE BUCKET. FURTHERMORE, IT ISIMPORTANT THAT THERE IS NORESTRICTION IN THIS LINE BECAUSE THEBACK PRESSURE DEVELOPED MAY BESUFFICIENT TO CAUSE THE LIQUID IN THECUP TO OVERFLOW INTO THE LARGECHAMBER. ON WARMUP, THE PRESSURE INTHE SAMPLER COULD BECOME EXCESSIVE,PARTICULARLY IF THE SAMPLE WERESUBCOOLED, NECESSITATING THEREPLACEMENT OF THE SAFETY RELIEFDEVICE. 4.2.6.7 Allow sampler to cool until a s teady flow ofliquid appears at outlet.CAUTION: AVOID CONTACT WITH THEFLOW OF CRYOGENIC LIQUID. THEEXTREMELY LOW TEMPERATURE CANCAUSE PAINFUL INJURIES. 4.2.6.8 Open inlet sampling valve completely to allowliquid to enter sampling cup.4.2.6.9 After 30 seconds, close sampli ng valve.4.2.6.10 Close supply tank outlet valve .4.2.6.11 Disconnect fill hose.4.2.6.12 Invert sampler for five minute s to allowsampling cup to empty and provide vaporization ofliquid.4.2.6.13 At ambient temperature the sa mpler should beat 400-500 psig, indicating that a good sample wasobtained. A lower pressure would indicate a leak in thesampler or that the cup was not filled with liquid. Ifthere is any doubt, release gas from sampler and takeanother sample.4.2.6.14 Re-install inlet and outlet fittin g caps.

Thissection will provide a guide for the format andrepresentation of such a procedure. Figure 1 is designedto represent the format for submission of suchmethodology.6.2 Sample Introduction  By its nature, gaschromatography implies the use of carrier gases intowhich the gaseous sample is injected and carried intothe separation medium, either solid or liquid in nature.

&lt;!-- Page 25 --&gt;

SEMI C3-0699 © SEMI 1986, 1999 6 The introduction of a gaseous sample into a carrier gasstream is accomplished by means of a sample injectionvalve. Valves for this purpose can be any of severaltypes, although the most commonly used are eitherrotary or diaphragm valves using loops of stainless steeltubing of a known volume. It is not necessary todiagram such sample introduction systems for aprocedure unless the introduction system is unique tothe application by way of special conditions for safetyor other reasons critical to the accuracy of the samplingtechnique.6.3 Separations  It is an accepta ble and commonpractice to quantitate several gaseous impurities with asingle gas chromatographic separation. Occasionally asingle injected sample volume will undergo"multidimensional" separation to achieve the necessaryanalysis. Rotary valves, diaphragm valves or Dean'spressure switching again are used to move impuritiesfrom one separation medium to another, or from onecolumn to another. Where multidimensional techniquesare used, they should be accompanied by flowpathdiagrams which clearly indicate valving and theirappropriate positions. The valving sequences usedshould have adequate explanation to clarify theseparations.6.4 Columns  Columns used are generally of 3.2mm (1/8 in.) o.d. and 2.2 mm (0.085 in.) i.d. stainlesssteel of varying lengths and packed with one of manysolid supports. Columns may be specified by length andpacking material if these standard dimensions apply. Ifanother dimension or material is used for the columnitself, it should be specified by material type, and byo.d. and i.d. in mm. Packing materials should bespecified by material, % coating and coating type ifapplicable, and mesh size. Capillary columns areassumed to be fused silica unless otherwise specifiedand should be specified by i.d. in mm, film thickness inm, and length in meters. Column temperatures andapplicable program rates should be given for eachindependently heated zone in degrees Celsius.6.5 Carrier and Support Gases  Carrier and supportgas flow rates for all separations should be specified.Carrier and support gases used should fall into thegeneral purity requirements in Table 2 and purity neednot be specified unless the analysis has specific purityrequirements for safety, accuracy, or componentlifetime. Flows should be specified in mL/min orL/min, or as linear velocity for open tubular capillarycolumns.6.6 Detectors  Detector technolo gy should bespecified, and alternative detection may be assumedequivalent for detectors of like selectivity andsensitivity. Table 2 gives a reference of relativedetector sensitivity and is provided as a guideline only. Detector parameters are less likely to be easilyformatted since detector technologies vary widely intheir specific parameters. All elements critical toachieving like sensitivity must be included, such astemperature, make-up gases and their flows, flame,combustion or reaction gas ratios or flows, voltages,currents, or any additional settings as outlined by thedetector manufacturer.6.6.1 Detection limits must be speci fied for eachimpurity for the actual methodology used. Because thelower detection limit can be greatly influenced byretention time for any impurity, it is important that thedetection limit be derived for the impurity within thecontext of the method, and not solely on thedetectability of the detector. Detection limits areassumed to be calculated on a mole/mole basis.6.7 Operating Procedures  The standard procedureassumed for the gas chromatographic analysis of mostgases is as follows:1. Inject the calibration standard onto the columnusing a gas sampling valve. Record the retentiontime(s) and peak area(s) for all impurities detected.2. Analyze the sample to be tested in the samemanner as the calibration standard.3. Repeat 1.4. Compare the average peak area of the calibrationstandard with that of the sample being tested. (SeeCalculation of Concentration, in Section 6.9.) 6.7.1 The method should specify an y additional valveswitching or special parameters which are necessary forthe successful analysis of the impurities specified forthe procedure. It must also specify the order of elutionif multiple impurities are detected.6.8 Calibration  Calibration for these analyticalprocedures is generally by external, single pointcalibration. Calibration gas mixtures should bespecified and are assumed to be within the rangespecified in Section 2.26. Calibration standards areassumed to be made in a balance of gas representativeof the sample unless otherwise specified. If calibrationtechniques other than external, point calibrations areused, they must be described.6.9 Calculation of Concentration  The calculation ofthe concentration of impurity within the sample is basedon a comparison of the average peak area of theimpurity in the calibration standard, to the average peakarea of the impurity within the sample, based on theformula:Sample Peak AreaStandard Peak Area  Concentrationof Standard = Concentrationof Sample

Thismethod may be referenced when it is finalized.7.2 Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds7.2.1 Because of the importance of t race elementalimpurities impacting silicon device characteristics,there is an increasing need for the detection andquantitative analysis of low-level impurities in thesilicon materials used in device fabrication. Some ofthese materials are gaseous silicon-containingcompounds, such as silane and the chlorosilanes. Forelemental analysis by FTIR or PLS, a compound mustfirst be converted to a solid form such as a singlecrystalline rod or disc. For the quantitativedetermination of metals and some non-metallicelements, the gases can be passed through a series ofbubblers containing high-purity DI water or diluteacids. The aqueous media can be concentrated andanalyzed by suitable techniques such as ICP or AA spectroscopy. In both cases, the recovery is assumed tobe 100% efficient or, in other words, there is no loss ofany impurity from the silicon source.7.2.2 FTIR (Fourier Transform Infra red)Spectroscopy, PLS (Photoluminescence Spectroscopy)and NAA (Neutron Activation Analysis) are probablythe most useful tools for the detection and analysis oftrace quantities of elemental impurities in solid siliconmaterials. NAA requires special silicon materialspecimens to be submitted to neutron irradiation in anuclear reactor and the analysis facility to be approvedby the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) andother government agencies. In contrast, FTIR and PLSdo not require special governmental regulations, and theinstrumentation is available on the open market.7.2.3 An FTIR spectrometer is an in fraredspectrometer in which a Michelson Interferometer isused in place of a grating or prism. The simplicity ofthe Michelson Interferometer, with only one movingpart, an oscillating mirror, along with a He-Ne laser as areference, provides nearly absolute frequency accuracy.This translates into a high spectral resolution. FTIR hasgreater detection efficiency since the energy-wastingslits required for dispersive spectrometers are not used.With a microcomputer to control the functions and toperform data processing, signal averaging is used toimprove the signal-to-noise ratio. All these features leadto good reproducibility and rapid measurement resultscompared with conventional IR techniques.7.2.3.1 As FTIR is a transmission met hod, it requires asingle crystalline silicon specimen with flat, parallel,mirror-polished surfaces. For oxygen in silicon, theabsorption peak at 9 microns is used for quantitativeanalyses. For carbon in silicon, the absorption band at16 microns is used. Both measurements may beperformed at room temperature. (The carbondetermination has strong interference from the siliconphonon band, but can be resolved with high purity,carbon-free standards.) For the determination ofshallow donors and acceptors, FTIR measurementsmust be made at liquid helium temperatures, but thethrough-put is low. Although the operation of today'sFTIR instrument is relatively simple, the interpretationof the results through software and associatedproblems/solutions is not. Quantitative analysis is basedupon the measured percent transmission at thecharacteristic wavelength and compared to standards.Detection limits at about 10-12°K are in the 10 11 to 10 13atoms/cc for shallow donors and acceptors, 3.1  10 14atoms/cc for oxygen, and 2  10 15 atoms/cc for carbon.

Electronhole pairs called excitons are formed by incidentradiation (514.5 nm line from argon laser). The decayof these exciton or multi-exciton states yields thelines characteristic of the impurity atoms. For elementaldetection, the observed emission lines must be assignedas being extrinsic (due to impurities) or intrinsic (due tosilicon). The luminescence process itself appears toocomplex to attain precision or accuracy from basiccalculations. The PLS emissions are analyzed as afunction of wavelength, suggested to be 1077 to 1139nm, for the elemental determination of shallow donorsand acceptors in silicon. Quantitative measurements ofimpurities are based on the extrinsic-to-intrinsic intensity ratio and compared to standards. The PLSemissions are analyzed using a monochromator anddetected by a photomultiplier. Sensitivity in the rangeof 5  10 10 to 5  10 11 atoms/cc has been claimed for B,Al, P, and As.7.2.4.1 In order to obtain reliable mea surements, thesilicon specimens must be in single crystalline formwith a mirrored surface. Epitaxial wafers with layers ofthickness greater than 10 microns are suitable, since thesample's depth appears to be less than 5 microns.However, it is still in the development stage, and veryfew laboratories have such capability. A number ofquestions remain unanswered, including the following:1. What is the effect of compensating impurities?

&lt;!-- Page 29 --&gt;

SEMI C3-0699 © SEMI 1986, 1999 10 2. What is the effect of deep levels and intracentertransitions on the intensity ratios?3. What is the effect of crystallographic defects? Ofpoint defects? And of surface defects?4. Interference from other shallow impurities maymask the detection of very low-level impurities.For instance, PLS signal of Al at 1078.5 nm maybe affected by strong signals from As at 1079.0 nmor at 1078.2 nm. 7.2.4.2 CVD-deposited films in single crystalline formcan be used for elemental detection of donors andacceptors for gaseous silicon compounds. However,PLS does not detect carbon, oxygen, or nitrogen. It isalso not useful for metallic impurities. That is, ingeneral, PLS is useful only for a very limited number ofimpurities.7.2.5 Based on this analysis, it was r ecommended thatthe SEMI Gases Analytical Procedures Subcommitteeshould wait for further development of innovative andimproved analytical techniques for the quantitativedetermination of low-level elemental impurities basedon FTIR and PLS. Meanwhile, techniques such as ICP,AA, and Ion Chromatography may be applicable to avery large number of impurities of interest to the siliconsemiconductor industry. Development and adaptation ofthese technologies should be encouraged.7.2.6 AA (Atomic Absorption Spect rophotometry),ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma EmissionSpectrometry), and IC (Ion Chromatography) areprobably the most valuable instrumental techniques forthe detection and analysis of trace elemental impuritiesin aqueous media. These techniques usually require thatthe elements be dissolved in an aqueous medium. Dueto this fact, and the fact that the elemental impuritiesare typically present in silane and the chlorosilanes atthe ppb and sub-ppb levels (which is beyond thedetection limits for these techniques for most elements)it is usually necessary to concentrate the impuritiesprior to analysis, such as by passing the gas through aseries of impingers (i.e., gas bubblers) containing eitherDI water or, more commonly, acidic solutions. Fromanalyses of the impinger solutions together withknowledge concerning impinger solution volume(s) andboth the flow rate and period of flow of the gas, theconcentration of the respective elements in the originalgas should be readily calculated to a fairly high degreeof accuracy.7.2.6.1 Atomic Absorption Spectroph otometry can beused for elemental analyses for a multitude of elementsin the periodic table at detection limits ranging fromppm to ppb, depending both on the exact configurationor setup and the element being analyzed. The principle of the technique involves conversion of an incomingaerosol into an atomic vapor which can absorb lightfrom a primary light source, usually a hollow cathodelamp or an electrodeless discharge lamp (EDL), thelatter providing improved sensitivity and lowerdetection limits for certain elements. In addition, aflameless (i.e., graphite furnace) technique can be usedto increase sensitivities and detection limits 50 to 100times better.7.2.6.2 Complementary to Atomic Ab sorption Spec-trophotometry is Flame Emission Spectrophotometry,which differs in the absence of a primary light source.Again, a flame is utilized to convert an incomingaerosol into an atomic vapor. However, the flame alsothermally elevates the atoms to an excited electronicstate, and, when the atoms return to the ground state,they emit light detectable by a photomultiplier. Thistechnique is ideal for the analysis of Li, Ha, and K atppm and sub-ppm levels.7.2.6.3 Inductively Coupled Plasma E missionSpectrometry (ICP) is rapidly replacing AtomicAbsorption Spectrophotometry for elemental analysesof liquids, since approximately 70% of the elements inthe periodic table can be determined with betterprecision and equal or better sensitivity with minimalsample preparation. Detection limits, in fact, for thistechnique range from ppm to sub-ppb levels, dependingboth on instrumental and/or experimental conditionsand the element being analyzed. ICP involvesnebulizing liquid samples either directly or in dilutedform into a spray chamber where a stream of argon gascarries the smaller sample droplets into the axialchannel of an argon plasma which reaches temperaturesof 4000-8000°K. The common technique employs anoptical system for detection. Newer techniques arebeing investigated using a mass spectrometer as adetection system coupled to an ICP excitation source.This is referred to as ICP/MS.7.2.6.4 Ion Chromatography (IC) uses the principle ofion exchange to separate anionic and cationic species atdetection limits ranging from ppm to ppb, dependingagain both on the instrumental and experimentalconditions and on the element being analyzed.7.2.6.5 Detection of ionic species in IC is mostcommonly accomplished by an electrical conductivitydetector capable of measuring most non-transitionmetal cations and anions to sub-ppm levels. Anelectrochemical detector (for amperometric detection)is available for measuring any electroactive specieshaving an oxidation/reduction potential near the appliedelectrochemical cell potential. This latter detector iscapable of measuring many ionic species at ppb levels(e.g., Br , CN , S, etc.).

SEMI C3-0699 © SEMI 1986, 199911 7.2.6.6 Of the three aforementioned te chniques,Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry, InductivelyCoupled Plasma Emission Spectrometry, and IonChromatography, the most sensitive method ofanalyzing for a multitude of elements is, without doubt,graphite furnace (i.e., flameless) Atomic AbsorptionSpectrophotometry. However, this instrumentaltechnique suffers the disadvantage of being slow andtedious. Consequently, Inductively Coupled PlasmaEmission Spectrometry is rapidly replacing AtomicAbsorption Spectrophotometry for elemental analysesof liquids since it is a reasonably fast techniquerequiring minimal sample preparation with practicaldetection limits being superior to those of standard (i.e.,flame) Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry for mostelements and approaching those of graphite furnaceAtomic Absorption Spectrophotometry for many of theelements. An added attractive feature of InductivelyCoupled Plasma Emission Spectrometry is thateventually it may be used to analyze for elementsdirectly in gases. Preliminary work, in fact, is currentlybeing conducted in this area by several research groups.Although Ion Chromatography can be used to analyzefor a multitude of non- transition metal cations (e.g., Li+,Na +, K +, Rb +, Cs + Ba +2, Mg +2, Ca +2, Sr +2, etc.) it islimited by the fact that currently only a few transitionmetals (e.g., Ni+2, Cu +2, Co +2, Zn+2, Fe +2, Fe +3, Cd +2,etc.) can be analyzed by this instrumental technique. IC,however, has the advantage in that it can be used foranalyzing for complex cationic and especially anionic species directly (e.g., NH 4+ , NO 2+, NO 3- , SO 3- , SO 4-2 ,PO 4-3 , OC1 - , SCN - , CN - , CO 3-2 , etc.) and for differentoxidation states for certain elements (e.g., Fe+2 andFe +3), unlike the other techniques, which are strictlylimited to elemental analyses only. Furthermore, IC isextremely valuable for analyzing ionic species,particularly anions (e.g., F- , Cl- , etc.) of many commonelements which otherwise cannot be analyzed directlyby either Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry orInductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometry. 8 Standards8.1 Certified Standards shall be m ade by weighttraceable to the National Institute of Standards andTechnology. 9 Determination of Precisio n9.1 To Be Determined. 10 Safety10.1 Because of the continuing evo lution of safetyprecautions, it is impossible for this publication toprovide definite statements related to the safe handlingof individual chemicals.

SEMI C3.12-1102 © SEMI 1983, 20023 4.2.4.8 Compare the average peak areas for at leastthree runs each of the calibration standard to that of theammonia sample being tested. Calculate theconcentration of hydrocarbons C1  C3, using theformula below. The result may not exceed thespecification in Section 2 of this standard.Sample PeakAreaStandard PeakArea Concentrationof Standard = Concentrationof Sample 4.3 Water  The method for the determination ofwater in ammonia is based on its decomposition by thereaction 2NH 3  N 2 + 3H 2, which occurs completelyand irreversibly when ammonia is passed over a nickelcatalyst at 1000C. Water passes through the catalystunchanged. Therefore, the water content of ammoniamay be determined by measuring the dewpoint of thestream of hydrogen and nitrogen produced bydecomposition of ammonia.NOTE 12: The system should be checked for leaks prior touse to preclude atmospheric contamination of the sample.NOTE 13: The moisture analyzer must be calibratedaccording to the manufacturers specified method prior to use.4.3.1 Apparatus (shown in Figure 2)4.3.1.1 The nitrogen and ammonia are connected to atee with 3.2 mm (1/8 in.) OD stainless steel tubing,keeping the lines as short as is practical.4.3.1.2 The nitrogen may be fed from a regulator.4.3.1.3 The ammonia should be fed through a stainlesssteel needle valve.4.3.1.4 The furnace is a Lindberg Model 54032 orequivalent, with an Inconel reaction tube. The reactiontube is 0.6 m (24 in.) long by 25 cm (1 in.) OD andterminates in 3.2 mm (1/8 in.) swaged tubingconnectors.4.3.1.5 The reaction tube is filled with nickel lumps,MCB Catalog number NX305 or equivalent.4.3.1.6 The outlet of the furnace is connected by a 1.2m (4 ft) by 3.2 mm (1/8 in.) OD stainless steel tubing toa moisture analyzer suitable for determining theconcentration of water should be a mixture of hydrogenand nitrogen at the specified concentration. This lengthof tubing is required to permit adequate cooling of thegas between the furnace and the moisture analyzer. 4.3.1.7 The outlet of the moisture analyzer is connectedto the inlet of a 0-10 CFH flowmeter.4.3.1.8 The outlet of the flow meter is connected to anappropriate vent for the disposal of ammonia, nitrogenand hydrogen.4.3.2 Operating Procedure4.3.2.1 Start a nitrogen purge flow of approximately 5CFH.4.3.2.2 Set furnace to 950C and allow to equilibrate(approximately 1.5 to 2 hours).4.3.2.3 With the ammonia cylinder valve closed,disconnect the tubing from the cylinder outlet and openthe ammonia inlet needle valve to allow the ammoniasample line to purge with nitrogen. Reconnect thetubing to the cylinder outlet and close the needle valve.4.3.2.4 Shut off the nitrogen flow.4.3.2.5 Open the ammonia cylinder valve and adjustthe needle valve to obtain a flow of approximately 5CFH.4.3.2.6 Gradually increase the furnace temperature,periodically testing the gas for the presence of ammoniaby placing a piece of wet red litmus paper in the ventstream. If ammonia is present, the paper will turn blue.When ammonia is no longer found, the appropriatecatalyst temperature has been reached.4.3.2.7 Measure the concentration of water in thenitrogen and hydrogen stream, following theinstructions of the moisture analyzer manufacturer.Periodically test the vent stream for the presence ofammonia, as described in Section 4.3.2.6, and adjust thefurnace temperature as necessary.4.3.3 Reporting of Measurement4.3.3.1 Double the water concentration obtained inSection 4.3.2.7 to correct for the doubling of gasvolume by the decomposition of the ammonia.4.3.3.2 Subtract twice the concentration of oxygen (asmeasured by the procedure specified in Section 4.3) inthe sample from the concentration of water calculatedin Section 4.3.3.1. This is necessary because oxygen inthe ammonia reacts with the hydrogen formed bydecomposition to produce additional water.4.3.3.3 The concentration of water calculated in Section4.3.3.2 in the ammonia may not exceed the limitspecified in Section 3.

SEMI C3.51-1101 © SEMI 1995, 2001 4 Cleaning of lines, flow meters and valves shall be completedbefore a new cylinder has to be analyzed and shall be repeatedafter 10 samplings, or if a new cylinder has to analyzed. Theimpingers must be rinsed with water after each sampling.Before a new cylinder has to be analyzed and after fivesamplings, the impingers must be cleaned using the abovedescribed procedures. Drying of the impingers is notrecommended (contamination risks).NOTE 8: Cleaning of cylinder valve.Clean outside (visible parts, threads) with wipe. Clean theinterior parts of the valve-outlet with methanol or isopropanolusing a syringe, followed by a purge with filtered gas.7.5 Iron and Nickel  This procedure is for thedetermination of iron and nickel in gas phase borontrichloride using atomic absorption or inductive coupledplasma methods.7.5.1 Detection Limits7.5.2 Instrument Parameters  Operate the designatedanalytical instruments according to the manufacturersinstructions.7.5.3 Sampling Procedure7.5.3.1 Clean all metallic and plastic componentsaccording to the procedures described in Notes 6 and 7.Use 18 MΩcm water.7.5.3.2 Connect all components of the samplingsystem.NOTE 9: The apparatus is charged with sufficient water tojust cover the rim of the funnel (approximately 100 ml). Amagnetic stirrer is introduced and the apparatus closed.7.5.3.3 Connect the sampling system to the sampleboron trichloride cylinder (see Note 8).7.5.3.4 Purge with filtered argon (&lt; 0.01 ) atapproximately 1 L/min. for 15 minutes prior tosampling. During this period, the apparatus is inclinedso as to allow a higher flow rate without excessiveagitation of the water. NOTE 10: Due to the design of the apparatus, suck-backshould be prevented, but this must be guarded against. Abubble rate of about one per second should be set.7.5.3.5 While observing the sampling apparatus,operate the needle valve to admit sample slowly to thesampling apparatus. Initial absorption will be fast.7.5.3.6 The sample flow is halted when no furtherabsorption seems to be taking place (i.e., when bubblerate increases at the vent).7.5.3.7 The argon purge is re-established for a further15 minutes.7.5.3.8 The apparatus is allowed to cool and thecontents quantitatively transferred to a 250 mlpolypropylene flask.NOTE 11: The solution prepared above will contain somecrystals of boric acid which have come out of solution duringcooling. For the purpose of analysis, the concentration ofboric acid must be reduced. Also the amount of BCl 3 samplesneed to be determined.7.5.3.9 A 5 ml aliquot of the solution is titrated against1 M NaOH using methyl red as an indicator. Thequantity of sample boron trichloride taken is thencalculated.7.5.3.10 A sample of the solution is diluted  10 withwater. The aliquot is taken from the supernatant liquid.7.5.3.11 Analysis is carried out in a suitable analyzercapable of meeting the required detection limits. Ablank solution of 1% hydrochloric acid is used.Yttrium is used as an internal standard at a level of 0.2ppm added to all analysis solutions.7.5.3.12 Calibration curves are prepared using standardsolutions covering the elements required. Traceablestandards can be obtained from national andinternational bodies.7.5.3.13 Calculate the concentration of iron and nickelcontent using the calibration curve and the volume ofboron trichloride sampled.
