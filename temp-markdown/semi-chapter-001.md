SEMI E1-0697 © SEMI 1979, 20031 SEMI E1-0697 (Reapproved 1102) E SPECIFICATION FOR 3 inch, 100 mm, 125 mm, AND 150 mm PLASTICAND METAL WAFER CARRIERS This specification was technically approved by the Global Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee and isthe direct responsibility of the North American Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee. Current editionapproved by the North American Physical Interfaces and Carriers Committee on July 21, 2002. Initiallyavailable at www.semi.org October 2002; to be published November 2002. Orignally published in 1979;previously published June 1997.E The designation of SEMI E1 was updated during the 0303 publishing cycle to reflect the editorialmodification of SEMI E1.5 via PIP form. 1 Scope1.1 This specification covers the dimensionalrequirements for plastic and metal wafer carriers usedfor the processing and handling of 3 inch, 100 mm, 125mm, and 150 mm diameter wafers. The specificationhas two classifications: General Usage and AutoTransport Usage. General Usage is a basic guidelinethat covers 3 inch, 100 mm, 125 mm, and 150 mmwafer sizes. Auto Transport Usage is intended to meetthe in-use requirements for the interface of wafercarriers with automated wafer processing equipment.Auto Transport Usage covers the 125 mm and 150 mmsizes.1.2 To meet these specifications, carriers must bemanufactured within the dimensional limits and bedimensionally stable within the specification when usedin accordance with manufacturers recommendations.1.3 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.NOTE 1: Recommended usage should be agreed to betweenuser and supplier, since wafer carriers are manufactured froma number of different materials by several manufacturingmethods. 2 Terminology2.1 For a pictorial explanation of most of the selecteddefinitions, see Figure 1.

SEMI E1.9-0701E2 © SEMI 1994, 20043 5 Ordering Information5.1 Intended Use  This standard is intended tospecify 300 mm cassettes over a reasonable lifetime ofuse, not just those in new condition. For this reason, thepurchaser needs to specify a time period and thenumber and type of uses to which the cassettes will beput. It is under these conditions that the cassettes mustremain in compliance with the requirements listed inSection 6.5.2 Temperature Ranges  The purchaser of 300 mmcassettes needs to specify two sets of temperatures towhich the cassettes might be exposed. An operatingtemperature range is the set of environmentaltemperatures in which the cassettes will remain incompliance with the requirements listed in Section 6. Atemporary temperature range is the set of environmentaltemperatures to which the cassettes can be exposedsuch that when the cassettes return to the operatingtemperature range, the cassettes will be in compliancewith the requirements listed in Section 6. Limits onexposure times to elevated temperatures should bespecified. Also, the purchaser needs to specify a rangeof temperatures for the wafers that might be inserted inthe cassettes.5.3 Info Pad Configurations  The purchaser of 300mm carriers needs to specify the desired info padconfiguration (up or down). See Appendix 1(Application Notes). 6 Requirements6.1 Kinematic Couplings  The physical alignmentinterface on the bottom of the cassette consists offeatures (not specified in this standard) that mate withsix pins underneath as defined in SEMI E57. Most ofthe dimensions of the cassette are determined withrespect to the three orthogonal datum planes defined inthat standard: the horizontal datum plane, the facialdatum plane, and the bilateral datum plane. All of thedimensions for the cassette are bilaterally symmetricabout the bilateral datum plane. The three features thatmate with the pins must provide a lead-in capabilitythat corrects a cassette misalignment no greater thanr19 in any horizontal direction. However, it isrecommended that robots placing cassettes onkinematic couplings use as little of this lead-incapability as possible to avoid wear. 6.2 Wafer Orientation and Numbering  The wafersmust be horizontal when the carrier is placed on thecoupling, and the wafers are numbered in increasingorder from bottom to top (so the bottom wafer is wafernumber 1, the next wafer up is wafer number 2, etc.).After processing at a tool, each wafer should bereturned to the same slot from which it was taken.6.3 Cassette Sides  Figure 1 shows a cross-section ofthe horizontal boundaries of the cassette side domains(which contain the parts of the cassette higher than z6above the horizontal datum plane and lower than z15above the top wafer). In this and following figures, themost heavy lines are used for surfaces that havetolerances (not surfaces that have only maximum orminimum dimensions). Table 1 defines the dimensionsshown in this and following figures. The maximumprotrusions of any part of the cassette from the nominalwafer center line and from the bilateral datum plane isr5 and x9, respectively. There are two optional side grippits on each side. For optically sensing whether acassette is properly in place, from left to right under thebottom wafer is an optical cassette sensing hole. Theradius of this hole is given with both upper and lowertolerances, but the upper tolerance is only to define aminimum aperture that must be met at only one sectionon each side. Other than through the optical cassettesensing holes, the cassette bottom and side domainsmust block any line of sight passing through both of thetwo rectangles at x10 on each side bounded by z4, z20,y2, and y3.6.4 Cassette Top  Figure 2 shows a top view of thehorizontal boundaries of the cassette top domain whichcontains any part of the cassette higher than z15 abovethe top nominal wafer plane. The top robotic handlingflanges (optional), the side grip pits (optional), andoptical cassette sensing hole on the side can be seen inFigure 3, which is an oblique view of the maximumcassette dimensions (see Figure 14 to see how cassettesneed not take up all of that volume). The maximumradial protrusions of the cassette top in the front andrear are r6 and r12, respectively. Dimensions x6, x12(shown in Figure 4), and y15 define a vertical path foroptically sensing wafers through the top and bottomdomains.

SEMI E1.9-0701E2 © SEMI 1994, 2004 6 6.5 Cassette Bottom  Figure 4 shows a bottom viewof the horizontal boundaries of the cassette bottomdomain (which contains any part of the cassette lowerthan z6 above the horizontal datum plane). At thenominal wafer center line, a circular hole with a radiusof r7 must be present (up to a height of z5) in thecassette bottom to avoid interfering with pod latch pins.For moving the cassette on roller conveyors and forpicking up the cassette with a fork lift, the cassette musthave surfaces on the left and right open to the bottomand outside bounded by x15, x16, r10, z3 and z4. Acylindrical section of radius r8 and axis at x11 on thefacial datum plane must be clear up to a height of z22 tohold the cassette firmly on the lifting forks by the use ofa cylindrical pin.6.6 Carrier Sensing Pads and Info Pads  When thecassette is fully down, the carrier sensing pads (shownin Figure 5) must be z2 above the horizontal datumplane. It is recommended that the areas surrounding allof the carrier sensing pads be designed in conjunctionwith the features that mate with kinematic coupling pinsso that a mechanical sensor pin cannot interfere withthe lead-in function of the kinematic couplings. Othersensing pads (called info pads and given letter names)communicate information about the carrier. Carriertypes that might need differentiation include the opencassette, the front-opening unified pod (FOUP), thesingle-wafer interface (SWIF), and the front-openingshipping box (FOSB) in both 13-wafer and 25-wafercapacities (and possibly other capacities if reduced-pitch versions are later standardized). Note that sincethis is a bottom view, the positions of sensors on a loadport will be switched, with the sensor for info pad A onthe right and the sensor for info pad B on the left as onefaces the tool from the front.6.7 Vertical Dimensions  Figures 6 through 13 showthe vertical dimensions of the cassette. Note that z8 (theheight of the bottom nominal wafer seating plane abovethe horizontal datum plane) and z12 (the distancebetween adjacent nominal wafer seating planes) aregiven as absolute distances with no tolerance. Thismeans that the sum of actual height variations in thecassette from the kinematic coupling to the supportingfeatures holding each wafer must be contained within the tolerance of z10 with no further stack-up at eachhigher wafer. The method for meeting this requirementis left up to the cassette supplier.6.7.1 The open space for the wafer set-down volumeconsists of a cylindrical section with radius r2 and amain axis parallel to and y1 in front of the nominalwafer center line. The top of this cylindrical section isz11 above the nominal wafer seating plane and itsbottom is z10 above the nominal wafer seating plane.The implications for wafer positioning of the toleranceon r2 are as follows. The wafers should be placed in thecassette within a circle of radius corresponding to thesmaller bound on r2 to avoid touching the edge of thewafer to the side of the cassette. Once the wafer hasbeen placed, the cassette must not allow a wafer tomove outside of a circle of radius corresponding to thelarger bound on r2. There are two exceptions to thislimit on wafer movement. When the wafer is pushedtoward the rear of the cassette, the location of the waferis defined by the wafer pick-up volume (see Section6.7.3). When the cassette is gently tilted forward up to45°, the wafers may slide forward, but it is recom-mended that they not extend further than y20 from thefacial datum plane. This may be accomplished bydesigning the teeth supporting the wafers to include awafer stopper at the front (as shown in Figure 11) thatis outside of r2 and under z29. Note that use of thisfeature will reduce the height of the wafer extractionvolume.6.7.2 The open space for the wafer extraction volumeincludes a cylindrical section with radius r3 and a mainaxis parallel to and y1 in front of the nominal wafercenter line. The top of this cylindrical section is z11above the nominal wafer seating plane and its bottom isz23 above the nominal wafer seating plane. The waferextraction volume also includes the extrusion out thefront of the cassette of this cylindrical section and theportion of the wafer set-down volume above z29. Theimplications for wafer extraction of the definition ofdimension r3 (r3 ≥ r2 + 1) are as follows. The cassettemust give an extra 1 mm (0.04 in.) of horizontalclearance once the wafer is picked up from wherever itends up (within the bounds of r2) after transport in thecassette.

However, if the wafer is notpushed toward the rear of the cassette (or the cassette is not tilted back during transport), then the wafer mayonly be somewhere within the wafer extraction volume.The wafer pick-up volume is defined by a cylindricalsection with radius r1 and a main axis at the nominalwafer center line.

Specifically, the surface defined by z4 may berotated by an angle  about the line where z4 intersectsy29 (as shown in Figure 13). Only the surface behindy29 may be rotated. Thus, the height of z4 shown inFigure 12 might only be defined at y29, and z4 can begreater than 15 ± 1 behindy29. However, the flatness ofthe resulting tilted surface must still fall within thetolerance given for z4.6.8 Cassette Identification Tag Area  The followingareas are provided for putting identification tags on thecassette. Examples of such tags include thin electronicmodules and printed labels designed to be read byeither humans or machines. It is recommended thatsuch tags be contained within the 18 mm by 60 mm(0.71 in. by 2.36 in.) region defined when the boundsare tight. It is also recommended that if such tags aresmaller than the minimum bounds of the tag area, theyshould be centered within those bounds.6.8.1 An optional place for an identification tag on thetop of the cassette is shown in Figure 14. Although theheight of this surface is not specified, the surface mustbe completely visible from above. The parallelism of the top identification tag with respect to the horizontaldatum plane is given by z25. It is recommended that theidentification tag should be centered on the bilateraldatum plane at a point y21 behind the facial datumplane.6.8.2 An optional place for an identification tag on theright-hand side of the cassette is shown in Figure 15(where right-hand is defined as the right side of thecassette when it is oriented correctly and it is viewedfrom the rear). Although the left-right location of thissurface is not specified, the surface must be completelyvisible from the right of the cassette. The parallelism ofthe side identification tag with respect to the bilateraldatum plane is given by x27. It is recommended that theidentification tag should be centered on the facial datumplane at a point z99 above the horizontal datum plane.6.8.3 An optional place for an identification tag on thebottom of the cassette is shown in Figure 16. Althoughthe height of this surface is not specified, the surfacemust be completely visible from below. The parallelismof the bottom identification tag with respect to thehorizontal datum plane is given by z25.

Again, no tolerance is given on thewafer pitch (z12), for reasons given in Section 6.7.6.10 Inner and Outer Radii  All concave featuresmay have a radius no greater than r15 to allow cleaningand to prevent contaminant build-up. All requiredconvex features must also have a radius of r16 toprevent small contact patches with large stresses thatmight cause wear and particles. Here a required featureis an area on the surface of the carrier specified by adimension (or intersections of dimensions) that has atolerance and not just a maximum or minimum (such asthe rim of the fork-lift pin hole, the edges of the robotichandling flanges, and the corners at the rear of thecassette top and bottom domains).6.11 Vertical Wafer Access  This standard does notcover accessing wafers in a vertical orientation. 7 Related Documents7.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E22.1  Cluster Tool Module Interface300 mm: Transport Module End Effector ExclusionVolume StandardSEMI E47.1  Provisional Mechanical Specificationfor Boxes and Pods Used to Transport and Store 300mm WafersSEMI E62  Provisional Specification for 300 mmFront-Opening Interface Mechanical Standard (FIMS)SEMI E63  Provisional Mechanical Specification for300 mm Box Opener/Loader to Tool Standard(BOLTS-M) InterfaceSEMI E103  Provisional Mechanical Specificationfor a 300 mm Single-Wafer Box System that Emulatesa FOUPSEMI M28  Specification for Developmental 300mm Diameter Polished Single Crystal Silicon WafersSEMI M31  Provisional Mechanical Specification forFront-Opening Shipping Box Used to Transport andShip 300 mm Wafers

SEMI E1.9-0701E2 © SEMI 1994, 200419 APPENDIX 1APPLICATION NOTES NOTE: The material in this appendix is an official part ofSEMI E1.9 and was approved by full letter ballot procedureson December 18, 1998. The recommendations in thisappendix are optional and are not required to conform to thisstandard.A1-1 The cassette capacity is intended to include onetest wafer. It is recommended that process equipmentbe designed for 12 or 24 product wafers, but toolrobotics should reach all slots.NOTE: The carrier capacity need not be the same as thetransport group size, the process batch size, or the virtualtracking unit size.A1-2 The shape of the features holding the wafers isnot specified in this standard. However, a mizo toothshape (an exaggerated version of which is shown inFigure A1-1) is recommended. It is also recommendedthat the surface that touches the wafer have a largeradius to minimize stress on the wafer and thesupporting feature. It is recommended that thesupporting feature touch the wafer only on the backside and far enough away from the edge to avoidcontact with the wafer notch (if any) in any radialorientation. wafer tooth Figure A1-1Mizo Tooth A1-3 In general, it is recommended that the wafernotch and/or its fiducial identification marks be kepttoward the front of the cassette and the front of thecassette top extend no farther than y14 from the facialdatum plane, so that the identification marks on the topwafer can be read without removing the wafer.A1-4 Extra clearance (larger than the pitch) has beenadded below the bottom wafer (for non-randomsequential access to the wafers with a faster or lessprecise robot) and above the top wafer (for accessingthe wafers in a vertical orientation), see Section 6.11.A1-5 If wear at the kinematic couplings is a concernwith plastic cassettes, ceramic or metal inserts can beused for the mating features.A1-6 Skewness, warp, rock, and stiffness are implicitlydefined in the geometric tolerances.A1-7 To increase the stability of the cassette on thekinematic couplings, the points on the cassette bottomthat are the most distant from the lines connecting eachpair of coupling pins can be made as close as practicalto the horizontal datum plane so that the cassette cannottip very far off of the kinematic coupling pins.A1-8 Figure A1-2 shows several paths for opticallysensing the presence and planarity of wafers in thecassette. Also shown are the two vertical paths forsensing how far the wafers protrude. Figure A1-2Optical Sensing Paths

SEMI E1.9-0701E2 © SEMI 1994, 2004 20 A1-9 Figure A1-3 shows a small-footprint cassette thatconforms to the requirements of this specification. Inorder to prevent such a small cassette from being set onthe kinematic couplings in the wrong orientation, aframe such as shown in Figure A1-4 can be placedaround the couplings. In order to not interfere with thekinematic couplings alignment function, the frame canextend no further than r19 from the maximumboundaries of a cassette.NOTE: If the bottom of the cassette does not extend belowthe bottom conveyor rail, the conveyor rail may becomecontaminated and may distribute particles. Figure A1-3Small-Footprint Cassette Figure A1-4Frame to Prevent Misalignment A1-10 Conveyor rail edges need to be well defined forsmooth guidance and to avoid vibration. Thus, theminimum radius on the edge that does not createparticles is recommended. For similar reasons, thetolerance on conveyor rail parallelism and ondimension x16 should be kept as small as possible forthe materials used.A1-11 Table A1-1 can be used for communicatingwhich optional features are present on cassettes thatcomply with this specification.A1-12 In general, info pad A (on the lower left inFigure 5) was intended to indicates the carrier capacity(the number of wafers). For example, info pad A waspreviously defined to be in the down position (at z2above horizontal datum plane) if the carrier holds 13wafers and was previously defined to be in the upposition (at z26 above horizontal datum plane) if thecarrier holds 25 wafers. Info pad A is intended to beread with a mechanical switch or optical sensor.A1-13 In general, info pad B (on the lower right inFigure 5) was intended to indicates the carrier type(cassette or box, etc.). For example, info pad B waspreviously defined to be in the down position (at z2above horizontal datum plane) if the carrier is a cassetteand was previously defined to be in the up position (atz26 above horizontal datum plane) if the carrier is abox. Info pad B is intended to be read with amechanical switch or optical sensor.A1-14 Info pads C and D (slightly forward and to theoutside of info pads A and B) are intended to showwhether the carrier is dedicated to the front-end-of-line(FEOL) part of the fabrication process (before anymetal layers have been deposited on the wafer) or to theback-end-of-line (BEOL) part of the fabrication process(during which metal contamination may be present). Ifsuch carrier differentiation is required by the user, infopads C and D are recommended to be down and up(respectively) for a front-end-of-line carrier and theopposite for a back-end-of-line carrier.

SEMI E2-93 © SEMI 1986, 20031 SEMI E2-93 (Withdrawn 1103)SPECIFICATIONS FOR QUARTZ AND HIGH TEMPERATURE WAFERCARRIERSThese specifications were technically reapproved by the Physical Interfaces & Carriers Committee and arethe direct responsibility of the North American Physical Interfaces & Carriers Committee. Current editionapproved by the North American Regional Standards Committee in October 1998. Initially available atwww.semi.org February 1999; to be published February 1999. Originally published in 1986; previouspublished revision in 1996.NOTICE: This document was balloted and approvedfor withdrawal in 2003.1 Scope1.1 These specifications cover the dimensionalrequirements for quartz and high temperature wafercarriers used in processing wafers. These generalrequirements assist in the compatibility of wafercarriers and most automated wafer processingequipment. Wafer pre-orientation is recommendedbefore transferring wafers into quartz carriers to avoidinterference between the flat fiducial(s) and carrierslots. These standards are intended to promote theinterchangeability of wafer carriers and encourage theproduction of equipment suitable to a greaterpercentage of the market.1.2 The design definitions of SEMI Wafer CarrierSpecifications assume compliance to wafer dimensionsdefined in SEMI M1, M3, or M9. For a wafer carrier tobe said to meet the SEMI specifications, it must bemanufactured within the dimensional limits of the givenspecification, and in addition be dimensionally stablewithin specification when used in accordance withmanufacturer's recommendations. Since wafer carriersare manufactured from a number of different rawmaterials and several different manufacturing methods,it is up to each manufacturer to determine therecommended usage for each wafer carrier type. Thespecifications were not established nor do theyrepresent or suggest a means to obtain any idealefficiencies in wafer processing results or quality of endproduct.1.3 For referee purposes, SI (System International,commonly called metric) units shall be used for 80 mmand larger diameter wafers. 2 Selected Definitions2.1 For illustrations of terms, see Figure 1 for CarrierStyle 1, and Figure 2 for Carrier Style 2. Dimensionsand tolerances are given in Table 1 of the standards forcarriers of the appropriate wafer diameter.2.1.1 base  the material at the bottom of the carrierthat the carrier rests on when placed on a flat referencesurface. 2.1.2 bottom plane  a horizontal plane tangent to thebase.2.1.3 end  either end of carrier parallel to waferplane.2.1.4 lift access  the clearance space used to insert animplement to pick up a wafer carrier.2.1.5 side  either one of the sides perpendicular tothe wafer plane. 3 Dimension DefinitionsSymbolA Wafer Height  distance from the horizontal center lineof the wafer to the bottom planeB Base Width  the outside dimension of the base fromside to sideC Base Length  length of the base from end to endD Lift Access Height  distance from horizontalcenterline of lift access opening to bottom planeE Lift Access Spacing  distance from center line tocenter line of lift access openingF Lift Access Opening  size of opening for the insertionof an implement to pick up the carrierG Base End to First Slot  the distance from either end ofthe carrier to the first slot on same endH Slot Spacing  the distance from the center line of oneslot to the center line of the adjacent slotI End Slot to other End Slot  the center line of the firstslot on either end to the center line of the slot on theother endJ Pocket Size  the diameter of a circle coincident to thebottom of all wafer slots in a wafer positionK Base Side to Wafer Center line  horizontal distancefrom the vertical wafer center line to either side of thebaseL Carrier Region  region enclosed by the greatestincluded angle between a line drawn from the centerpoint of the wafer and the outermost member of thecarrier on one side and a similar line on the other sideP Separation  separation of wafers when placed in slots

SEMI E2-93 © SEMI 1986, 20033 APPLICATION NOTE NOTE: The material contained in these application notes is not an official part of SEMI E2 and is not meant to modify orsupersede it in any way. Rather, these notes are provided primarly as a source of information to aid in the application of thestandard, as such, they are to be considered as reference material only. The standard should be referred to in all cases.Table A1-1 lists the dimensions in linear, versusangular, measurements for ease of dimensionalverification. The dimensions fall within SEMIspecification; however, they correspond closer to anL angular dimension of 140 degrees versus the 150degrees. The figures A1-1 and A1-2 illustrate thesedimensions for non-contiguous and contiguous stylequartz carriers. A1-1 Carrier  Dimension LAutomated mass transfer of silicon wafers requiresedge contact below the centerline of the waferaccording to Table 1. These dimensions have beendetermined as the minimum distance below the wafercenter line allowing the gripping mechanism to overlap the vertical tangent of the wafer edge below thecenterline. This overlap allows the wafers to bepassively crattled. Contacting the wafer any highertoward the centerline will require clamping force on thewafers.
