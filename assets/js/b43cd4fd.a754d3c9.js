Determination  of  the  suitability  of  the  material  is  solely  the\nresponsibility of the user.\nR3-1   There is a considerable amount of information that should accompany BRDF measurements.  This suggested\ndata  file  format  (see  Table  R3-1)  divides  the  information  into  descriptive  headers  followed  by  a  data  sequence  of\nvariables.  The headers consist of laboratory information, system information, sample information and measurement\nparameters.  These are simply generic labels that help to organize the fields under the headers.  Any of the header\nfields can be a variable in the data sequence; however, variables are normally limited to measurement parameters.\nR3-2   The data files are stored as ASCII text fields.  Each set of data taken is stored as a  separate  data  file.    Each\nfield  in  the  headers  and  each  data  point  in  the  data  sequence  begins  on  a  new  line  (carriage  return\u2013line  feed  pair\nterminates each line).  Multiple items under each field in the headers and multiple variables per data point field in\nthe data sequence are separated by commas.  Each field in the headers has a unique one word name preceding the\nfield contents on the same line.  This name identifies the contents of the field.  The first character of a name must be\nan alpha character.\nR3-3   The data sequence must come at the end of the file.  Each line in the data sequence represents a single data\npoint.  It must begin with a numeric character, the \u201c+\u201d character or the \u201c\u2212\u201d character.  Multiple variables for each\ndata point are on the same line but separated by commas.  This permits the data sequence to be printed as a set of\ncolumns.    Each  variable  must  remain  in  the  same  column  throughout  a  file.    The  VARS  field  specifies  which\nvariable is in each column.\nR3-4   Because  of  the  name  tag,  there  is  no  position  dependence  for  information  in  the  headers.    The  number  of\nheader fields can vary from one data file to another.  If a certain field is not in the file it means that information was\nnot  recorded  or  does  not  apply  to  that  measurement.    Every  user  should  supply  a  format  template  for  their  header\nand  data  sequence  in  order  to  expedite  conversion  from  site  to  site  and  avoid  confusion  over  units  and  field  size.\nFields  can  easily  be  added  to  the  headers  if  sufficient  descriptive  text  is  provided  in  the  field  or  on  the  template.\nFields can be added or deleted from old data sets without obsoleting the data file.  This is a suggested list of fields in\na recommended grouping and order.  Additional fields can be defined by users, and they can be added to this guide\nas they become accepted by the scatter community.\nTable R3-1  Suggested Data Format\nLABORATORY

These  pits  are  bounded  by  planes  related  to  the  principal\ncrystallographic directions of the material.  These limiting boundary planes determine the shape of the pits when the\netched  surface  is  near  a  major  crystallographic  direction.    An  optical  examination  of  the  facets  comprising  the  pit\nwalls  relates  the  crystal  surface  under  examination  to  this  crystallographic  direction,  and  further  permits  a\ndetermination of the degree of misorientation of the surface from the crystallographic plane.\n5. 1.2\nA light beam that is reflected from such a preferentially etched surface may be focused upon a screen to form\na  definite  geometric  pattern  characteristic  of  the  surface  etch  pit  structure.    Patterns,  such  as  those  reproduced  in\nFigure 2, reflected from surfaces approximately parallel to (111)-, (100)-, and (110)-type planes are recognizable.  In\neach instance, the central portion of the pattern observed on the screen is the reflection from the bottom of the etch\npit.    These  bottom  facets  represent  planes  parallel  to  the  characteristic  crystallographic  plane  of  the  surface  under\ninvestigation.    Therefore,  when  the  central  reflected  beam  is  aligned  with  the  direction  of  the  light  beam,  this\ncrystallographic  plane  is  perpendicular  to  the  light  beam  direction.    This  observation  permits  orientation  of  the\ncrystal   along   a   desired   crystallographic   axis   or,   alternatively,   allows   the   determination   of   the   degree   of\nmisorientation of a crystal surface from a desired crystallographic plane.\n5. 2\nReagents and Materials\n5. 2.1\nPurity of Water \u2014 Reference to water shall be understood to mean Type E-3 or better water as described in\nASTM Guide D 5127.\n5. 2.2\nGermanium Etchant Solution \u2014 Mix 1 part HF, 1 part H\n2\nO\n2\n, and 4 parts water, by volume.\n5. 2.3\nHydrofluoric Acid (HF), 49%, in accordance with Grade 1 of SEMI C28.\n5. 2.4\nHydrogen Peroxide (H\n2\nO\n2\n), 30%, in accordance with Grade 1 of SEMI C30.\n5. 2.5\nPotassium Hydroxide Solution (KOH), 45% by weight in water, in accordance with Grade 1 of SEMI C40.\n5. 2.6\nSodium Hydroxide Solution (NaOH), 50% by weight in water, in accordance with Grade 1 of SEMI C43.\n5. 3\nApparatus\n5. 3.1\nLight  Beam  \u2014  originating  preferably  from  a  high-intensity  point  source.

The  specimens  tested  were  four  (111)  p-type  chips  from  about\n0. 05 to about 1500 \u2126\xb7cm, six (111) n-type chips from about 0.01 to about 500 \u2126\xb7cm, one (100) n-type chip at about\n10 \u2126\xb7cm  and  three  (100)  p-type  chips  from  about  0.01  to  about  10  \u2126\xb7cm.    Analyses  of  data  to  obtain  estimates  of\nrandom  error  were  done  separately  for  three  categories  of  specimen  preparation  for  which  sufficient  data  were\nreturned  to  obtain  reliable  estimates.    In  each  category  of  specimen  preparation,  estimates  of  random  error  were\nobtained  for  the  resistivity  range  from  0.01  to  200  \u2126\xb7cm;  estimates  were  not  obtained  from  the  two  specimens  of\nhighest resistivity.\n16. 2    The  two  components  of  within-laboratory  random  error  that  were  evaluated  for  each  specimen  preparation\ncategory  and  resistivity  range  are  the  repeatability,\n\u03c3\nr\n,  the  relative  standard  deviation  of  a  set  of  measurements\nobtained  after  a  single  preparation  of  a  specimen,  and  the  reproducibility,\n\u03c3\nR\n,  the  relative  standard  deviation  of\nmeasurement averages following re-preparations of a specimen.

This\nrelated information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures.\nR1-1    In  the  multilaboratory  experiment  each  laboratory  received  its  own  replicate  set  of  specimens.    For  each\nspecimen  type  used,  the  replicates  were  approximately  3  by  5  mm  chips  cut  from  the  central  region  of  a  single\nwafer.  Each laboratory was requested to take and report 4 sets of 25 measurements each, on each of the specimens.\nPrior  to  each  set  of  measurements,  each  specimen  surface  was  to  be  reprepared  by  the  participating  laboratory's\nchoice of one of the following procedures: (1) polishing with diamond\u2014either planar polishing the entire specimen\nsurface against an appropriate polishing pad or bevel polishing a portion of the specimen against a glass plate having\na  frosted  surface,  (2)  polishing  with  silica  in  an  aqueous  medium\u2014either  the  entire  specimen  surface  against  an\nappropriate polishing pad or on a beveled surface against a hard plastic surface, (3) lapping with alumina or garnet\nin  water\u2014either  the  entire  specimen  surface  or  on  a  beveled  surface  against  ground  glass  or  cast  iron.
