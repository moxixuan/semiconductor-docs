SEMI F83-0304 © SEMI 20041 SEMI F83-0304SPECIFICATION FOR DIMENSION OF TWO PORT COMPONENTS(EXCEPT MFC/MFM) FOR 1.125 INCH TYPE TWO FASTENERCONFIGURATION SURFACE MOUNT GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS This specification was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility ofthe Japanese Gases & Facilities Committee. Current edition approved by the Japanese Regional StandardsCommittee on November 20, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org February 2004; to be publishedMarch 2004. 1 Purpose1.1 This standard establishes the properties andphysical dimensions of two port components for 1.125inch type surface mount gas distribution systems. 2 Scope2.1 This document includes common requirements,layout, size, detailed specifications, and dimensions ofthe components.2.2 This standard applies to all two port two fastenercomponents (except mass flow controllers and massflow meters). The components (i.e. valves, pressureregulators, pressure transducers, filters and purifiers)are mounted on substrates with fasteners accessiblefrom the top.2.3 This standard only applies to components, whichcontrol flow of ≤ 50 slm nitrogen equivalent at 308 kPa(44.7 psia). This standard also only applies tocomponents with operating pressures less than 3445kPa (500 psia) at 20°C.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This standard only addresses the component; itdoes not address the seals, the sealing system, or theassembly process and does not guarantee theperformance of the sealing system. The user should beaware that gas delivery system performance and sealingsystem performance are addressed elsewhere in theSEMI standards.3.2 The user should be aware that alternativetechnologies are commercially available.3.3 International, national, and local codes, regulations,and laws should be consulted to ensure that the equipment meets regulatory requirements in eachlocation of use. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E49.9  Guide for Ultrahigh Purity GasDistribution Systems in Semiconductor ManufacturingEquipmentSEMI F20  Specification for 316L Stainless SteelBar, Extruded Shapes, Plate, and Investment Castingsfor Components Used in High Purity SemiconductorManufacturing Applications4.2 ASME Standards1 ASME Y14.5  Dimensioning and TolerancingNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 components for surface mount  a gasdistribution system component having inlets and outletslocated on the bottom of the component with theattachment mechanism accessible from the top.5.1.2 Ra  roughness average.

SEMI F86-0304 © SEMI 20041 SEMI F86-0304SPECIFICATION FOR DIMENSION OF TWO PORT COMPONENTS(EXCEPT MFC/MFM) FOR 1.125 INCH TYPE FOUR FASTENERCONFIGURATION SURFACE MOUNT GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS This specification was technically approved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibility ofthe Japanese Gases & Facilities Committee. Current edition approved by the Japanese Regional StandardsCommittee on November 20, 2003. Initially available at www.semi.org February 2004; to be publishedMarch 2004. 1 Purpose1.1 This standard establishes the properties andphysical dimensions of two port components for 1.125inch type surface mount gas distribution system. 2 Scope2.1 This document includes common requirements,layout, size, detailed specifications, and dimensions ofthe components.2.2 This standard applies to all two port four fastenercomponents (except mass flow controllers and massflow meters). The components (i.e. valves, pressureregulators, pressure transducers, filters and purifiers)are mounted on substrates with fasteners accessiblefrom the top.2.3 This standard only applies to components, whichcontrol flow of ≤ 50 slm nitrogen equivalent at 308 kPa(44.7 psia). This standard also only applies tocomponents with operating pressures less than 3445kPa (500 psia) at 20°C.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This standard only addresses the component; itdoes not address the seals, the sealing system, or theassembly process and does not guarantee theperformance of the sealing system. The user should beaware that gas delivery system performance and sealingsystem performance are addressed elsewhere in theSEMI standards.3.2 The user should be aware that alternativetechnologies are commercially available.3.3 International, national, and local codes, regulations,and laws should be consulted to ensure that the equipment meets regulatory requirements in eachlocation of use. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E49.9  Guide for Ultrahigh Purity GasDistribution Systems in Semiconductor ManufacturingEquipmentSEMI F20  Specification for 316L Stainless SteelBar, Extruded Shapes, Plate, and Investment Castingsfor Components Used in High Purity SemiconductorManufacturing Applications4.2 ASME Standards1 ASME Y14.5  Dimensioning and TolerancingNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 components for surface mount  a gasdistribution system component having inlets and outletslocated on the bottom of the component with theattachment mechanism accessible from the top.5.1.2 four fastener configuration  the component hasfour fasteners located on an interface, independent ofnumber of sealing point.5.1.3 Ra  roughness average.

The components aremounted on substrates with fasteners accessible fromthe top.2.3 This standard only applies to components, whichcontrol flow of ≤ 50 slm nitrogen equivalent at 308 kPa(44.7 psia). This standard also only applies tocomponents with operating pressures less than 3445kPa (500 psia) at 20°C.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This standard only addresses the component; itdoes not address the seals, the sealing system, or theassembly process and does not guarantee theperformance of the sealing system. The user should beaware that gas delivery system performance and sealingsystem performance are addressed elsewhere in theSEMI standards.3.2 The user should be aware that alternativetechnologies are commercially available.3.3 International, national, and local codes, regulations,and laws should be consulted to ensure that the equipment meets regulatory requirements in eachlocation of use. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E49.9  Guide for Ultrahigh Purity GasDistribution Systems in Semiconductor ManufacturingEquipmentSEMI F20  Specification for 316L Stainless SteelBar, Extruded Shapes, Plate, and Investment Castingsfor Components Used in High Purity SemiconductorManufacturing Applications4.2 ASME Standards1 ASME Y14.5  Dimensioning and TolerancingNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 components for surface mount  a gasdistribution system component having inlets and outletslocated on the bottom of the component with theattachment mechanism accessible from the top.5.1.2 Ra  roughness average.
