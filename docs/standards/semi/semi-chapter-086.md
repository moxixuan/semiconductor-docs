Certification proceduresshall include, at the minimum, producing threeacceptable welds in a row of typical GTA weld joints ofthe smallest and largest diameters of each alloy to bewelded. Welding parameters shall be set by the welderor welding operator. Certification shall expire after sixmonths of inactivity.7.5 The weld assembly shall be kept under acontinuous purge until all welding is complete.7.6 Welders shall use clean room-compatible glovesany time that the tubing or component to be welded isremoved from protective covering. 8 Apparatus8.1 Welding equipment shall be of the GTAW,constant current, DCEN (direct current electrodenegative) and electronically controlled type with rapiddynamic response capable of 5 Hz (CPS) or greaterpulsed welding.8.2 All welding fixtures and weld heads shall be cleanand free of any particulate and excessive discoloration.Weld heads shall rotate freely and smoothly at allspeeds. All clamping and holding fixtures shall fittightly around applicable fittings/tubing, allowing nomovement after clamping in excess of 0.003 inch(0.008 cm). The welding fixturing shall allow viewingof the weld joint to insure proper fit-up.8.3 Electrodes shall be precision ground to the factoryspecification for head and weld type. Electrode gapshall be set using tooling or procedures that provideaccurate and repeatable gaps to be set to within 0.002in. (0.005 cm). The use of 2% Ce-doped or 2% La-doped tungsten electrodes is recommended.8.4 Purge gas apparatus shall be stainless steel tubingand components with face seal fittings, when possible.PFA plastic tubing is acceptable as the final run toallow flexibility for hook-up. Lengths shall be restrictedto less than ten feet. All components that come intocontact with the weldment shall be stainless steel. Onlyheavy wall PFA or stainless tubing shall be used on theID purge. Only stainless tubing shall be used on HPsystems.8.5 Purge gas flow shall be measured and controlled.8.6 Facing equipment shall be of the dry endmachining style. The equipment shall be capable oftolerances of 0.003 inches from a plane perpendicularto the centerline of the tube, the OD and /or ID burr ofless than 0.005 inches. The equipment shall be capableof controlling the cut curl so as that it does not enter thetubing or cause scratching of the ID surface. Theequipment shall not use oils or lubricants in a way that

&lt;!-- Page 2 --&gt;

SEMI F78-0304 © SEMI 2003, 20045 may contaminate the tubing being faced. The cutting orfacing shall not be of a abrasive type.8.7 Severing or parting equipment shall be of themachining type that will separate the tubing withoutcontaminating the ID of the tubing. Wheel type cuttersdesigned to cut stainless steel and CRAs are allowedwith purge. Dry saws of orbital type or cutoff areallowed only when followed by cleaning to 12.5. Allcut ends shall meet the tolerances for facing equipmentor be followed by end preparation with a facing tool. 9 Materials9.1 All materials to be welded shall be manufactured toASTM specifications and so certified by themanufacturer. Certification shall conform to ASTMA450, Section 25.9.2 All seamless austenitic stainless steel tubing shallbe in conformance with SEMI F20 or customerspecification.9.3 A backing (ID) gas is required during welding, andwhile tacking (if tacking is used).9.4 Weld parameters are affected by the choice ofshield gas. Argon, due to its effectiveness and materialcompatibility, is the most commonly selected shieldingand purging gas. Argon and helium are inert andtherefore have no effect on the weld metal. These gasesdo have very different ionization potentials, thermalconductivity, and reactivity.9.5 Argon/hydrogen mix is a reducing gas that avoidsthe formation of oxides. It also reduces the amperagerequired for a given ID weld bead width while reducingthe OD bead width. Argon/hydrogen mixes adverselyaffect high ferrite materials (above 80% ferrite). Use ofargon/hydrogen mixes will shorten tungsten electrodelife. The weld parameters will be affected by hydrogento argon percentages. Hydrogen mixes above 5 vol%are not recommended for safety reasons.9.6 Nitrogen will cause instability of the arc in mixesabove 3 vol% in the shield (OD) purge gas. It is aacceptable backing (ID) gas for austenitic stainless andmany CRAs. Nitrogen when exposed to weldingtemperatures will cause nitride formation in some highferrite materials (above 80% ferrite). Use of nitrogenmixes in the shielding (OD) gas will shorten thetungsten electrode life.9.7 The ID purge gas will be certified to 99.9997%, orless than 3 ppm total contaminants (moisture, oxygen,and other contaminants). 10 Safety Precautions10.1 This practice does not purport to address all of thesafety issues associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.10.2 Welding equipment used to make welds shall beoperated in accordance with the manufacturersoperating and safety instructions.10.3 All welding performed under this practice shallconform to the applicable requirements of ANSI/ASCZ49.1.10.4 Welding gas mixtures containing more than5 vol% H 2 are not recommended due to the potential forfire hazard.10.5 Do not reweld stainless steel that has been usedfor corrosive gas delivery.10.6 See Appendix 1 for information on stainless steeland welding fume. 11 Test Specimens: Couponing11.1 Prior to the welding of a particular size, wallthickness, and alloy, a primary standard sample weldshall be made, sectioned, and analyzed at the job site.The primary standard sample weld shall become the on-site work sample against which other welds of the samesize, wall thickness, and alloy are judged. This on-sitework sample may be used indefinitely or reproducedeach day at the discretion of the examiner.11.2 The primary standard sample weld shall bechecked for compliance with SEMI F81, Specificationfor Visual Inspection and Acceptance of Gas TungstenArc (GTA) Welds in Fluid Distribution Systems inSemiconductor Manufacturing Applications. Couponsshall be cross-sectioned and inspected visually. Weldcoupon criteria are the same criteria for all systemwelds.11.3 Once a sample weld is found to be acceptable, allessential and supplementary essential variables shall bedocumented in the procedure qualification record.11.4 Any significant deviation(s) from the on-sitework sample will cause the weld(s) to be rejected.Rejected welds shall be removed and replaced.11.5 Sample test welds shall be made periodically.These sample test welds shall be compared to the on-site work sample and checked for compliance withSEMI F81. Deviation from the on-site work sample orSEMI F81 shall be cause for rejection.

SEMI F78-0304 © SEMI 2003, 2004 16 APPENDIX 1STAINLESS STEEL AND WELDING FUME NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI F78. It has been derived from the citeddocuments. Determination of the suitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user. A1-1 GeneralA1-1.1 The fume generated when welding stainlesssteels includes respirable particles, the composition ofwhichparticularly with the flux-shielded weldingprocessessuggests a risk to cause cancers. However,epidemiological analyses have not identified any actualrisk specific to stainless steels but have shown a slightexcess of lung cancers among welders as a whole, i.e.both welders of non-alloyed steels and welders ofstainless steels, compared with the general population.The cause of this excess has not been identified but maybe connected with factors incidental to welding.Nevertheless, appropriate precautions to avoid exposureto welding fume of all kinds are advisable and indeednecessary if regulatory limits are to be observed.A1-1.2 There is an important difference between thechemical forms of chromium in fume from the fluxprocesses and from the gas-shielded processes. In theformer group most of the chromium is present inhexavalent form (chromates), while almost allchromium in fume produced by the gas-shieldedprocesses is in the trivalent form and hexavalentcompounds are only present in very small proportions.The relevance of this difference is that, withoutreference to welding, hexavalent chromium compoundsare classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) bythe IARC5 particularly lung cancer. This fear is basedon the chemical composition of the fume, especiallythat produced by the flux processes, and the very smallsize of the particles, which puts them in the respirablerange, i.e., capable of penetration down to the level ofthe lung alveoli. Trivalent chromium compounds areunclassifiable to carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3).Nickel compounds are also classified in Group 1 by theIARC.A1-1.3 Further information on the above topic can befound in Status Report: Stainless Steel and WeldingFume, SR-0008, March 2001, Nickel DevelopmentInstitute, 214 King Street West, Suite 510, Toronto,Ontario, Canada M5H 3S6.A1-1.4 For information about hexavalent chromium,refer to HESIS Hazard Alert, June 1992, HazardEvaluation System & Information Service, CaliforniaOccupational Health Program, 2151 Berkeley Way,Annex 11, Third Floor, Berkeley, CA 94704. 5 International Agency for Research on Cancer NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties orrepresentations as to the suitability of the standards setforth herein for any particular application.

It is assumedthat silicon is in the wetted path as a coating or asilicon-based component (eg. a valve, orifice, sensor,mass flow controller) in the gas distribution system.The ambient temperature and operating temperaturelimits are typical for the industry. No additional energysource, thermal, radiative or ionizing, is present. Themoisture content of the gas is not specified for thepurpose of this guideline; the recommendations applywhether or not the conditions are anhydrous. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardSEMI E52  Practice for Referencing Gases Used inDigital Mass Flow ControllersNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Classification of Gases5.1 The gases included are taken from SEMI E52; thenumber assigned to a gas is the same as in thatdocument. 5.1.1 Inerts5.1.2 Hydrogen5.1.3 Hydrocarbons5.1.4 Halogenated Hydrocarbons5.1.5 Hydrides5.1.6 Halogens, other than Fluorine5.1.7 Halides, other than Fluorides5.1.8 Fluorine and Fluorides5.1.9 Organo-metallic and Siloxanes5.1.10 Oxygen and Oxides and Sulfides5.1.11 Nitrogen and Nitrogen Compounds5.1.12 Acids5.1.13 Other 6 Review of the literature6.1 Inerts6.1.1 References (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are cited which indicatethese gases do not react with silicon under theprescribed conditions.6.2 Hydrogen6.2.1 References (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are cited which indicatethese gases do not react with silicon under theprescribed conditions.

SEMI F79-0703 © SEMI 2003 2 a halogenated hydrocarbon, is a radical specie offluorine, chlorine or other halogen. A low pressureplasma is the typical method of creating this radical. Inaddition, Winters (78) points out that for anunassisted etching reaction to take place adsorptiononto the silicon surface must be followed by four welldefined steps. Should any of the steps not occur, or beinterrupted, etching will not proceed.6.4.2 Two of the most widely used halogenatedhydrocarbons are CF4 and C4F 8 . The Matheson GasBook (79) says this about the chemical properties ofCF 4 , ...Carbon tetrafluoride is extremely stable,reacting only slightly even at the temperature of acarbon arc.... About C4F 8, ...Octafluorocyclobutaneis extremely stable. It is unreactive with other materialsunder ordinary conditions. At high temperatures(600°C), it dissociates to form carbon and carbontetrafluoride and some toxic compounds...6.5 Hydrides6.5.1 References (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 64, 65, 66) are citedwhich indicate these gases do not react with siliconunder the prescribed conditions.6.6 Halogens, other than fluorine6.6.1 The halogens represent a special class ofmaterials. Molecular or atomic chlorine, iodine orbromine have been reported not to etch silicon attemperatures below 200°C orwithout the assistance ofa plasma (19, 26, 50, 55, 56, 63). Schwartz (74) makesthe comment. Although Cl2 chemisorbs spontaneouslyon silicon, (in a plasma) at low temperatures thereaction between Si and Cl does not proceed to theformation of SiCl4. That is, silicon does not etch in Cl2except at elevated temperature. He goes on to note:...except in the case of highly doped silicon, etchingoccurs at low temperatures in the reactive ion etchingsystem not because of the ease of Cl attachment butbecause partially reacted silicon can be sputteredreadily. Schwartz then reports the observation thatthere was no perceptible etching after thirty minutes ina Cl2 plasma when there was no cathode bias on thewafer; in contrast to 4.5 microns of removal when thebias was applied.6.6.2 Flamm (55) published in 1981 and titled TheDesign of Plasma Etchants, states, ...Chlorinecontaining halocarbon feed gases are frequently usedinstead of Cl2 because they are not hazardous (beforereaction), are noncorrosive, and they decompose in theplasma to generate radicals (in addition to chlorineatoms) which induce some desired effects. Thisstatement applies to a plasma based system; Flamm ispointing out the difficulty of etching silicon with justCl2 or Br 2 in a plasma. He points out that Wang andMaydan (from a private communication in 1979) have etched silicon in a pure Cl2 plasma at pressures below0.05 torr.6.6.3 Flamm goes on to say that, ...It seems thatchlorine and bromine atoms do not spontaneously etchSiO 2 or undoped single crystal silicon but do etch someforms of polycrystalline silicon and heavily n-dopedsingle crystal and polycrystalline silicon...6.6.4 A conclusion here is that even with a plasma Cl2and Br 2 require very specialized conditions to etchsilicon.6.7 Halides, Other Than Fluorides6.7.1 Gaseous mixtures of HCl, HBr or HI will not etchsilicon at the prescribed conditions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 62).However, mild pitting of the silicon may be observed inHBr or HI under aqueous conditions (5). In laboratorytesting (10) no reaction of the silicon was noted with50% aqueous HBr after 45 days immersion.6.7.2 One reason for the lack of reactivity of siliconwith chlorine, bromine or iodine halides is the lowvapor pressure of the reaction product. SiCl4 has thelowest boiling point at 57°C; SiBr4 boils at 154°C andSiI 4 at 286°C. On the other hand, the boiling point ofSiF 4 is 86°C. Practical advantages of this low vaporpressure and non-reactivity were demonstrated byTexas Instruments in their patents (24, 25) on RIEetching; controlled additions of HBr, HI, BCl3, amongother gases, led to passivating films of SiBr4, etc. on thesilicon side walls and allowed vertical wall etching tobe achieved.6.7.3 The moisture content of the gas stream can be acritical factor in the corrosion resistance of mostmaterials. Typical stainless steel passivity is stronglydependent upon the amount of H 2O present, decliningsharply as water content increases above 1 ppm in thepresence of halogens or halides (6, 9, 10, 72). Paciej(72) reported that 0.1 ppm moisture in HCl does notattack 316L stainless, while 200 ppm moisture in HClcan significantly corrode the surface of this material.Fine (9) points out similar behavior for 316L in HBr at0.5 ppm and 100 ppm moisture over the course of 10days.6.7.4 However, silicon corrosion resistance is virtuallyunaffected by moisture content up to and includingaqueous solutions. The RCA clean (67) andconventional wet etches (60, 68, 69) are obviousexamples of this.6.7.5 Silicon based halides, such as SiCl4, SiH 2 Cl2, etc.have not been reported to react with silicon under theprescribed conditions.

SEMI F79-0703 © SEMI 20033 6.8 Fluorine and Fluorides6.8.1 It is documented that fluorine (F2) and atomicfluorine, F, will attack silicon at room temperature (19,22, 26, 42, 49).6.8.2 Chen (49) used fluorine gas (F 2) at roomtemperature on freshly cleaned silicon; he measured anetch rate of about 100A°/min at 2.3 torr and 5 sccm ofF 2 flowing. He also noted a two to three hourincubation period before the etching started; theauthors speculate about the causes for this incubationperiod.6.8.3 Flamm (42) and Vasile (22) authored severalpapers detailing the mechanisms involved in atomicfluorine reacting with silicon. Flamms data producedthe following relation for the etch rate of silicon byatomic fluorine.6.8.4 R(Si) = 2.91\*10 -12\*n FT1/2 e-Eetch/kT where E etchis given as 0.108 eV. At n F = 2.9\*10 15 atoms/cc , theetch rate is reported to be about 3,000 A°/min at 25°C.6.8.5 Flamm used an RF discharge of at least 3.8 wattsto produce F from F 2. Vasile used thermal dissociationof F 2 to produce F; at 800°C he measured 47%dissociation; below 650°C , negligible.6.8.6 Flamm (55) also reports a similar relation for theetch rate of SiO 2 by atomic fluorine: R(SiO 2) =6.14\*10 -13\*n FT1/2 e- Eetch/kT where Eetch is given as0.163 eV.6.8.7 Flamm (55) states ...Fluorine atoms reactspontaneously with all forms of silicon, SiO2 and siliconnitride to form volatile products.6.8.8 Ibbotson (19) examined potential etchingprocesses which required no external energy sources.Silicon is rapidly etched by the gas-phase halogenfluorides ClF3, BrF 3, BrF5, and IF5 , in analogy to XeF2etching silicon..... By contrast, ClF and Groups III andV fluorides such as NF 3, BF3, PF3 and PF5 do notspontaneously etch either Si or SiO2 under the sameexperimental conditions.6.8.9 Winters (21) and Ibbotson (20) report that XeF2does not etch SiO 2. Regardless, silicon, with or withoutadditional oxide, is not recommended for use with F2,XeF 2, ClF3 and the other fluorine containing inter-halogens which may spontaneously decompose toatomic fluorine at temperatures below 200°C.6.8.10 As quoted from Ibbotsons article above,excluded from this list of reactive gases are compoundssuch as NF 3 , BF 3, PF 3 and PF 5 which have beenreported not to etch Si or SiO2 without the assistance ofa plasma or RF source (19) or require temperaturesabove 200°C (1, 35, 37, 38). 6.8.11 The ionized fluorine atom, F- , is reported to notreact with silicon under the prescribed conditions (1, 2,3, 4, 5, 19, 64, 65, 66). Further evidence of this is thefact that adding H2 to fluorine containing plasmasreduces the etch rate (55). The assumed mechanism isthe removal of F atoms as active species.6.8.12 Other fluoride compounds, such as SF6, whichdo not spontaneously decompose to atomic fluorinebelow 200°C are not a sourceof reaction (33, 34, 52,53, 55).6.8.13 WF 6 is a special case. Numerous articles (41,43, 44, 45, 46, 47) have been published on the CVD oftungsten films from WF 6. Two primary mechanismsare cited; the reduction of WF 6 by silicon and thethermal decomposition in the presence of H 2. As statedin Yarmoffs paper (43):The dissociative chemisorption of WF6 on Si (111)was found to be complete, even at room temperature.The reaction is self-poisoning at room temperature,however as the fluorine liberated from WF6 ties up theactive Si sites responsible for the dissociation.6.8.14 Tsao (41) reports that at 410°C only 200A° ofW will deposit from WF6 onto single crystal siliconwhich has an oxide thickness between 5 and 15 A°.C.A. van der Jeugel (46) describes the effect of dopinglevels on the self-limiting growth of tungsten films. Itis documented (44, 45, 47) that WF 6 will not deposit onSiO 2 without the addition of hydrogen or some otherinitiation mechanism.6.8.15 Using the selective deposition characteristic ofWF 6 in a device, Fleming, et.al. have patented (48) atechnique for producing wear resistant coatings oftungsten. Their invention requires a clean surfaceand a temperature higher than 200°C, preferably around450°C; exposure to WF6 then results in a self-terminating film of 550 nm.6.8.15.1 Zdunek (80) reported on electrochemicalbased work which indicated that unprotected siliconsurfaces exhibited no degradation after exposure toWF 6 for 5 days at 80°C. A similar result was observedfor Cl2 gas.6.8.16 As a point of interest, metals such as stainlesssteel, aluminum and nickel develop corrosion resistantcoatings of the respective fluoride when exposed toatomic fluorine during the proper passivation procedure(14, 23, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 35, 39, 40).6.8.17 Titanium, molybdenum, tungsten, brass andcolumbium have been reported to be unacceptablewhen exposed to gases such as ClF 3, which decomposeto atomic fluorine (27, 32).

SEMI F79-0703 © SEMI 2003 4 In summary, it is recommended that neither silicon,silicon dioxide nor silicon nitride be in the wettedpath when fluorine, F2, or the halogen fluorides,ClF3, BrF3, BrF 5, and IF5, plus XeF2 are in use.6.9 Organo-metallic and Siloxanes6.9.1 References (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 64, 65, 66) are citedwhich indicate these compounds do not react withsilicon under the prescribed conditions.6.10 Oxygen and Oxides and Sulfides6.10.1 References (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 64, 65, 66) are citedwhich indicate these gases do not react with siliconunder the prescribed conditions.6.11 Nitrogen and Nitrogen Compounds6.11.1 References (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 64, 65, 66) are citedwhich indicate these gases do not react with siliconunder the prescribed conditions.6.12 Acids6.12.1 Aqueous HF is the only single acid reported toetch silicon (70). Combinations of fluoride ions insolution with an oxidizing acid such as HNO 3 in anaqueous solution will etch silicon at practical rates (5,54, 60, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69).6.12.2 Madou (70) has an excellent review of themechanisms required for aqueous based etching; hecites Hu and Kerr (72) to report an etch rate of0.3°A/min. for n-type, 2 ohm-cm (111) silicon in a 48%HF solution at 25°C. Madou points out the strongdependence of etch rate in aqueous solutions on dopinglevel, light conditions and relative potential.NOTE 1: Most bases will etch silicon and silicon dioxide; theoxide is etched very slowly.6.13 Other6.13.1 As currently designated these are materials inSEMI E52-0302 not encountered in mass flowcontrollers under typical conditions. The manufacturershould be consulted. 7 Cautions and Warnings7.1 The reader is specifically requested to consult theMSDS and the manufacturers recommended practicesof any gas or liquid prior to use and to follow thesuggestions prescribed.7.1.1 All other appropriate safety procedures should befollowed as well. 8 Related Documents8.1 K.
