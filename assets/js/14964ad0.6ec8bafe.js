It has been derived from practical application by the task force members. Publication isauthorized by the vote of the responsible committee April 2, 2003.R2-1 Hazard Analysis TechniquesR2-1.1 IntroductionR2-1.1.1 This related information gives an overview of several hazard analysis techniques that can be used. Eachtechnique has its own limitation or is developed for a special type of risk assessment. For each technique a shortdescription of the technique and a reference, if available, is given. Of course, it is not possible to list all techniquesin this overview.R2-1.1.2 Analysis techniques: the choice of analysis technique depends upon the goal of the analysis. Two basictypes of techniques exist:R2-1.1.2.1 Top-down (deductive) techniques are suitable for determining the initiating events that can lead toidentify top events, and calculating the probability of top events from the probability of the initiating events. Theycan also be used to investigate the consequences of identified multiple failures. An Example of top-down techniquesis Fault Tree Analysis (FTA, see IEC 61025).R2-1.1.2.2 Bottom-up (inductive) techniques are suitable for investigating the consequence of identified singlefailures. Examples of bottom-up techniques are Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA, see IEC 812) andFailure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA, see MIL-STD-1629A).Table R2-1 Overview of Analysis Techniques and Area of UseWhen to use Where to UseTechniqueBeforemalfunctionAftermalfunctionProcess Work place Machine Organization Work Safety analysis X - - X - -What-If X - X X X -MORT X X - - - XChecklists X X X X X XAction Error Analysis X - - - X -HAZOP X - X - X -FMEA X - X - X -Event Tree Analysis X - X X X -Fault Tree Analysis X X X X X -Circuit Logic Analysis X X X - - -Interface Analysis X - X - X -Mapping X - - - X -Procedure Analysis X X - X - XContingency Analysis X - - X - XMathematical Malfunction analysis X - X X X -Work Space analysis X - X - XTask Analysis X X - X X -"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 32 --",">"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S10-1103 \xa9 SEMI 1996, 2003 12 R2-2 Summary of Risk AssessmentTechniquesR2-2.1 Work Safety Analysis  A checklist is used tocheck the working place on criteria such asenvironment, ergonomics, and organization. On all thecriteria of the checklist a rating is given. The overviewof the ratings gives the comfort of the working place.R2-2.2 MORT: Modified Fault Tree Analysis  Usedfor detection of organization and policy errors being theroot causes of incidents. MORT uses a systematiccontrol list. MORT was developed as a safetymanagement program.R2-2.3 Checklists  List of questions which is used asguidance for the assessment. Almost every techniqueuses a checklist. Checklists can be developed forgeneric or specific situations (e.g., EN 1050 safetychecklist).R2-2.4 Action Error Analysis  The consequences ofcorrect and incorrect actions are evaluated. Very muchbased on handling of the person and the controls used.R2-2.5 HAZOP  Hazard and Operability study:Small team of experts of the machine/process which,using a systematic checklist, checks for realisticfailures.R2-2.6 FMEA  Failure Modes, Effects Analysis(FMEA) is a tabulation of the system/plant equipment,failure modes, and each failure mode's effect on thesystem/plant equipment. The failure mode is adescription of how equipment fails (e.g., open, closed,on, off, leaks). The effect of the failure mode is thesystem response or accident resulting from theequipment failure. FMEA identifies single failuremodes that either directly result in or contributesignificantly to an important accident. Human/operatorerrors are generally not examined in FMEA, althoughthe effects of a mis-operation are usually described byan equipment failure mode. FMEA is not efficient foridentifying combinations of equipment failures that leadto accidents. The FMEA can be performed by twoanalysts or a multi-disciplinary team of professionals. AFailure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis(FMECA) is an FMEA with criticality rankings (Basedon MIL-STD-1629A).R2-2.7 What-if  Possible failures are checked onpossible consequences. A checklist, suited for theequipment to evaluate, may be used.R2-2.8 Event Tree Analysis  Event tree analysis is atechnique for evaluating potential accident outcomesresulting from a specific equipment failure or humanerror known as an initiating event. Event tree analysisconsiders operator response or safety system response to the initiating event in determining the potentialaccident outcomes. The results of the event treeanalysis are accident sequences, a chronological set offailures or errors that define an accident. These resultsdescribe the possible accident outcomes in terms of thesequence of events (successes or failures of safetyfunctions) that follow an initiating event. Event treeanalysis is well suited for operations that have safetysystems or emergency procedures in place to respond tospecific initiating events.NOTE R2-1: This technique is also known as Fault HazardAnalysis.R2-2.9 Fault Tree Analysis  Fault Tree Analysis(FTA) focuses on one particular accident event andprovides a method for determining causes of thataccident event. The fault tree itself is a graphic modelthat displays the various combinations of equipmentfaults and failures that can result in the accident event.The solution of the fault tree is a list of the sets ofequipment failures that are sufficient to result in theaccident event of interest. The strength of FTA as aqualitative tool is its ability to break down an accidentinto basic failures. This allows the safety analyst tofocus preventive measures on these basic causes toreduce the probability of an accident.R2-2.10 Circuit Logic Analysis  Logic of anelectrical circuit is checked by making a logic diagram.Possible errors are reviewed for their consequences.R2-2.11 Interface Analysis  Check how process,equipment and systems are connected to each other.Identify the risks of each connection.R2-2.12 Mapping  The first step in determining arisk profile is to develop a checklist of the areas of risk.These factors can be evaluated quantitatively (asaccurate measurements) or qualitatively (as levels ordescriptive states). The second step is carrying outsensitivity analyses for the quantitatively assessedfactors.R2-2.13 Procedure Analysis  Procedures arereviewed and checked if hazards occur in the steps orsequence of steps.R2-2.14 Contingency Analysis  Contingencyanalysis is a method of treating uncertainty thatexplores the effect on the alternatives of change in theenvironment in which the alternatives are to function.This is a what-if type of analysis, with the what-ifsbeing external to the alternative.R2-2.15 Mathematical Malfunction Analysis Identification of malfunctions, deviations in design aremade and the effect calculated.

Exhaust ventilation to control exposures to,and the spread of, airborne particulate should remain inservice during equipment decontamination, or alternateexhaust provisions should be made.9.4 Where equipment parts are rou tinely removedfrom the equipment for cleaning, such as those used in ion implanters, photoresist spinners/developers, andmetal deposition chambers, these parts should becleaned prior to equipment transfer.9.5 Where equipment parts are rou tinely removed andreplaced, such as filters, O-rings, or oil traps, theseparts should be removed and replaced with clean partsor appropriate blanking device prior to equipmenttransfer. If any such parts are removed but not replaced,this fact should be noted on decontaminationdocumentation (see Section 12 of this guideline).9.6 All liquid and gas lines on the equipment shouldbe appropriately purged, drained, protected againstcorrosion and process contamination, and securelysealed with blanking plugs, caps, or similar devices.9.7 Thorough decontamination ma y not be achievedwithin component systems or equipment due toinaccessibility (i.e., dead zone) or to physicalcharacteristics of materials. Equipment with such zonesrequire additional cycle purges and/or disassembly foraccess and proper cleaning. If completedecontamination cannot be achieved, follow theguidelines outlined in Section 11.9.8 While disconnecting equipmen t or removingcomponents, gas leak monitoring and pH levels shouldbe measured. 10 Requirements for Equipm ent Transferswithout Complete Decontamination10.1 It is recognized that, in some c ases, completechemical decontamination cannot or will not be desiredor achieved for various reasons (e.g., it will destroy theequipment (i.e., pumps), there is a need for failureanalysis). This section establishes guidelines for thetransfer of equipment intended for further productiveuse which cannot or will not be completelydecontaminated prior to transfer.10.2 If the contaminated equipment is a sub-component or subassembly of a larger piece ofequipment which will not be otherwise decontaminated,the contaminated sub-component or subassemblyshould be removed and transferred separately under therequirements of this section.10.3 Prior to transfer, the transferor must ensure thatany remaining potential hazards are clearly identified topersons handling, transporting, and receiving thisequipment, as specified in Section 11.

The sample area hasbeen decreased in the wet wipe sampling procedurefrom 0.25 m2 to 100 cm2 (0.01 m2) due to the size ofequipment and surfaces anticipated to be sampled forthis SEMI Guideline. Another relevant document onsampling for surface contamination is contained in theOSHA - Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration, U.S. Department of Labor, OSHATECHNICAL MANUAL, CPL 2 - 2.20B, Chapter 2,Sampling for Surface Contamination, February 5,1990. Chemical-resistant gloves should be worn whileperforming these procedures. Gloves should be clean toavoid tainting the samples obtained and should bechanged between the securing of samples to avoidcross-contamination. R1-1 General RecommendationsR1-1.1 Assure that the marking method for the samplecontainer and area to be wiped will not interfere withthe intended analysis.R1-1.2 Assure that the container will not absorb thematerial being sampled or add interfering material thatwill be detected during analyses.R1-1.3 Assure that the wetting agent will not react withthe material being sampled, interfere with the analysis,or degrade the shipping container.R1-1.4 Should it become necessary to swipe an areaother than 100 cm2 (e.g., a lever or knob or other part ofa tool), then record the estimated or, preferably,measured swipe area.R1-1.5 Submit a blank with each batch of swipesamples. The blank is a sampling device (such as aswipe tab) of the same type and from the same batch asthat used for the sampling and which is wetted andhandled just like the samples, but which is not rubbedon a surface. R1-1.6 Use appropriate personal protective equipmentduring sampling.R1-1.7 Samples should be analyzed by a competentand appropriately certified laboratory for the hazardousmaterials being evaluated.R1-1.8 The sampling and analytical methods usedshould be appropriate for the agent in question, withthe NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods, EPAs TestMethods for Evaluation of Solid Wastes (EPA SW-846),and OSHAs Sampling and Analytical Methods beingestablished methodologies. If new methods are to bedeveloped or reviewed, they should be approved by anindustrial hygienist certified by the American Board ofIndustrial Hygiene or by another appropriately certifiedor registered professional. R1-2 Wet Wipe Sampling ProcedureR1-2.1 Mark off a square area of approximately 100cm2 on the surface to be wiped, using a template whichis cleaned between each sampling event. If a template isunavailable or the area to be wiped is less than 100 cm2,note the exact dimensions and establish markings on thefour outer corners of the area to be wiped.R1-2.2 Label the appropriate wet sample containerwith the information listed in R1-1.5.R1-2.3 Hold a filter paper with a clean, impervious,gloved hand or metal clamp, and saturate the wipe witheither deionized water, isopropyl alcohol, or otherwetting agent, depending on the hazardous material tobe sampled.R1-2.4 Wipe the sampling area starting at the outsideedge and progressing toward the center, makingconcentric circles of decreasing size, applying moderatepressure. Fold the wipe sample with the exposed sidein, and fold it over again.R1-2.5 Carefully place the completed wipe sample inthe container for storage and transportation, withoutallowing the sample to contact any other surfaces. R1-3 Dry Wipe Sampling ProcedureR1-3.1 Label the appropriate dry sample container withthe information listed in R1-1.5.R1-3.2 Hold a filter paper wipe with a clean,impervious, gloved hand.R1-3.3 Wipe the sampling area, starting at the outsideedge and progressing toward the center, makingconcentric circles of decreasing size, applying"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 48 --",">"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI S12-0298 \xa9 SEMI 1998 8 maximum pressure.

R1-4 Scrape and Bulk SamplingNOTE: A scrape sample is one made by abrading materialand collecting it in a container which is sent to a laboratoryfor analysis. Scrape sampling might be done to assure leadand hexavalent chromium are not present in paint on theexterior of a tool. Bulk sampling requires the collection ofadequate amounts of the suspected material to allow formeeting minimum detection limits of the sampling andanalytical techniques being used. Close consultation isneeded with the accredited laboratory performing theanalysis. R1-5 Sample ControlR1-5.1 Label each sample container with the followinginformation before sampling: Sample Number Sample Location (where was sample taken from) Sample Type and Media Used Date of Sample Name of Person Performing Sampling Areas Sampled (in cm2)R1-5.2 Record each sampling event in a log book.Include a rough sketch of the equipment, associatedareas of concern, and exact sampling locations. Alsoinclude any other pertinent notes or details which mayaffect the interpretation of sample results.R1-5.3 Follow the chain of custody proceduresoutlined in EPA SW-846.R1-5.4 Analyze samples using standard methods, suchas those specified by NIOSH, OSHA or EPA SW-846,whenever possible.

It has been derived from the work of theoriginating task force. Publication was authorized by fullballot procedures. Determination of the suitability of thematerial is solely the responsibility of the user.This method was compiled from various sources. Theapplicability of this method and the validity of itsassumptions in the application for which it isconsidered must be determined by an appropriateprofessional. R2-1 Method 1This method is designed to be protective of the healthand safety of untrained and unprotected individuals. Inthis method, non-hazardous level is determined byassessment of the risk posed by potential exposure tothe contaminant(s). (This method is based on theassumptions that 1) the exposed portions of a workersbody collect a single layer of the contaminant, with adensity half that of the layer on the contaminatedsurface, in the course of a day and that 2) thiscontaminant is then incorporated, at the end of the day,into the body by either absorption or ingestion.) Thismethod is, therefore, probably inappropriate forcontaminants which are absorbed rapidly throughoutthe day.R2-1.1 Toxicity criteria are determined for each of thechemicals identified as potentially leaving a residue. Asan example, toxicity criteria used are reference doses(RfDs) for human uptake of chemicals (US EPAsIntegrated Risk Information System, 1996), and nosignificant risk levels (NSRLs) defined underCalifornias Safe Drinking Water and ToxicEnforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65). Dailyexposures to the RfD (expressed in mg/kg-day) over alifetime are not expected to cause adverse health effects(non-cancer effects). Daily exposure to the NSRL(g/day) over a lifetime are considered to pose aninsignificant (less than 1 in 100,000) increased canceror reproductive risk.R2-1.2 Oral and dermal exposures are considered.Dermal exposure is assumed to occur through directcontact with contaminated work surfaces (i.e., hands,arms, and face).

The fractionof skin contaminant that will be ingested orally (MF) is conservatively assumed to be 50%. This is approximatelyequivalent to a person ingesting all of the chemical that contacts the palms of the hands, but not the backs. Contactefficiency (CE) refers to the fraction of chemical that is removed from the contaminated surface through contactwith the skin. It is assumed that no more than 50% of the chemical contamination from equipment will rub off thesurface and adhere to the skin. Oral and dermal absorption factors are chosen as the most conservative numbers dueto limited available data.The exposure factor (EF) represents the fraction of time that a person could be expected to be in contact withchemical contamination from exposed surfaces. Exposure to surfaces is assumed to follow an occupational exposurescenario. This scenario includes the following conservative assumptions: A person works at the facility for 40 years of a 70-year lifetime; Exposure occurs 250 days per year (365 days); The skin is in contact with the chemicals for 12 hours per day. This assumes that the chemicals are not removedfrom the skin until washed, and the skin is washed only once per day.R2-1.4 The final HBCL for each chemical is then the lower of the levels for oral or dermal exposure routes.NOTE: These HBCLs represent levels that are considered to be health-protective for a person who contacts equipment withresidual contamination on a daily basis. These values are based on extremely conservative assumptions and are likely to providean overestimate of a health-protective clean-up level.")))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
