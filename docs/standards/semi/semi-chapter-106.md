When so specified, appropriate samplesizes shall be selected from each lot in accordance withANSI/ASQC Z1.4. Each quality characteristic shall beassigned an acceptable quality level (AQL) of lottolerance percent defective (LTPD) value in accordancewith ANSI/ASQC Z1.4 definitions for critical, major,and minor classifications. If desired and so specified inthe contact or order, each of these classifications mayalternatively be assigned cumulative AQL or LTPDvalues. Inspection levels shall be agreed upon betweenthe users and the suppliers. 8 Test Methods - DimensionsNOTE 3: Detailed test procedures of each item should bedetermined between the users and the suppliers.8.1 Thickness of Top Silicon Film  The followingtwo methods are available for thickness measurement.8.1.1 Reflective Spectroscopy  The light of visualwavelength (400800 nm) is introduced into top siliconfilm by varying its wavelength continuously, and thenthe reflective spectra is measured. When the light isintroduced into multi-layers of SOI wafers, reflectionoccurs on the surface of top silicon film and the frontand backside of BOX. In such a case, the phase varies.The final intensities of the light that reflects from topsilicon film surface are the sum of the intensity of lightthat reflects from each layer. The thickness of topsilicon film and BOX makes optical path difference andthen results in phase difference that is dependent on itswave length. The reflective light intensities, dependingon its wavelength, are measured. The reflective spectraare defined as the ratio of reflective light intensity toincident intensity. This spectra curve varies by thethickness of top silicon film and BOX. The top siliconfilm thickness is derived from the obtained spectracurve by approximate calculation based on simulation or by comparing with the database.8.1.1.1 Reference: J.-P. Colinge, Silicon-On-InsulatorTechnology, Kluwer Academic Publisher, 1991.NOTE 4: Thickness of top silicon film and BOX layer arelimited to measure because of using visual light.Example: Nanospec/AFT model : 210LCW, SP-FSC15Top silicon film thickness: 0.0115 mBOX thickness: 0.0043 mNOTE 5: Optical constant is already known in each ofmultilayers, and it should be constant in the whole layer.8.1.2 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectro-metry)  The reflectance spectrum of the specimen,which exhibits successive maxima and minimacharacteristics of optical interference phenomena, ismeasured as a function of wavelength using an infraredspectrophotometer. These maxima and minima areobserved when the optical path lengths of the infraredbeam, reflected from both the top silicon film surfaceand the top silicon filmburied oxide interface, differby an integral number of half wavelengths.Consequently, the thickness of top silicon film iscalculated using the wavelength of the extrememaximum and minimum in reflectance spectrum, therefractive index of Silicon and Silicon dioxide, and theangle of incidence of the infrared beam upon the SOIwafer.Reference: F95  Standard Test Method for Thicknessof Lightly Doped Silicon Epitaxial Layers on HeavilyDoped Silicon Substrates Using an Infrared DispersiveSpectrophotometer8.1.3 Definition of top silicon film thickness tolerance Thickness tolerance is defined below.8.1.3.1 After top silicon film thickness is measured atpredetermined number of points within an SOI wafer,the maximum and the minimum values are chosen, andthen the tolerance is defined as;

&lt;!-- Page 5 --&gt;

SEMI M41-1101 © SEMI 2000, 2001 12 Tolerance = Maximum value  Minimum valueNOTE 6: The location and numbers of measuring pointsshould be determined between users and suppliers.8.1.3.2 In case of multi-points measurements (ex. afew hundreds) within an SOI wafer, the tolerance isdefined as;Tolerance = 3 (3 times of the standard deviation)8.1.3.3 Measurement exclusion area such as waferedge should be determined between users and suppliers.NOTE 7: Recommendable metrologya) Reflective spectroscopy or FT-IR is recommended for top silicon film of less than several m (about 7 m), and FT-IR for top silicon film of more than several m(about 7 m)b) Tolerance is defined as the difference between themaximum and the minimum value after measuring several(ex. 9) points.c) It is not necessary to measure the BOX thickness of SOIwafer after bonding. It is OK to measure it before waferbonding.d) In case of the above 1) ~ 3), the number of measurementpoints and their location should be specified in case of severalpoints measuring, and the measurement exclusion area shouldbe specified in case of multi-points measuring.8.2 Crystal Defect of Top Silicon Film8.2.1 OSF (Oxidation induced Stacking Fault)  Thistechnique is applicable to the top silicon film of thickerthan 1.5 m. OSF density is measured by preferentialchemical etching and microscopic observation.Preparation of samples and measurement of OSFdensity are as follows:8.2.1.1 Sample Preparation  SOI wafers are oxidizedat 1,100°C, 1 h, in H 2 / O ambient after the SC-1 andSC-2 cleaning. Oxide is removed by ca. 25 % HF andthen the SOI wafers are preferentially etched by 1 m,applying JIS H 0609:1994(B), and then rinsedthoroughly in distilled water and blown dry. JIS H0609 defines the chromium-free preferential solution,which is composed of HF, HNO 3, CH 3COOH and H 2O.8.2.1.2 Measurement of OSF Density  Samples areexamined by an optical microscope. The samplesurface is observed by magnification of 200 X, andOSF is counted on SOI wafer within the scope alongthe two lines, which are parallel and perpendicular tothe orientation flat (so called cross scanning). OSFdensity is calculated from the count number andscanning area.8.3 Buried Oxide Defect8.3.1 Cu Decoration Method  In case of Bonded SOI, the buried oxide is usually formed by thermaloxidation. Therefore, the defect of buried oxide istaken into consideration only for the thin oxide cases.Buried oxide defect such as pinholes can be evaluatedby Cu decoration method. This method has beenapplied to the buried oxide film of less than 400 nmthickness. Sample preparation and Cu decoration areconducted by the following procedure. The top siliconfilm on the buried oxide is removed by KOH solution,and then cleaned and rinsed. The sample is set on agold-plated brass (Cathode) in the methanol solution.On the other side, a copper plate (Anode) is placed 5mm above the sample surface. Positive constant bias of13 MV/cm (ex. 40120 V for 400 nm oxide) is appliedto the copper plate for 5 minutes. Small leakage currentpasses through the buried oxide defect, andconsequently copper precipitates on the defects.Typical allowable defect density is &lt; 0.1/cm2.8.4 Metal Contamination8.4.1 The surface metal contamination can bemeasured by TXRF, AAS and ICP-MS methods.8.4.2 TXRF (Total X-Ray Fluorescence)  Total X-rayFluorescence uses a low angle incident, and a tightlycollimated X-ray beam excites the characteristic X-raysfrom impurity atoms near the sample surface. Usually,the angle of X-ray incident is less than 0.1 degree. Theelement identification and the amount of the elementcan be obtained by measuring energy and intensities offluorescence X-ray. The instrument provides a map ofimpurity element distribution. The surface metalcontamination (typically from Na to Zn) shall be lessthan 10 11 cm-2 in total.NOTE 8: This TXRF method is conveniently used to detectthe metals on the SOI wafer surface.8.4.3 AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry) The elemental characteristic absorption of the atom ismeasured by introducing sample solution as aerosolinto the flame and then spectral absorption through theflame from the light source is detected by thespectroscope. The flameless method, superior to theflame method in the sensitivity, is now broadly used.8.4.3.1 Sample Preparation  Careful samplepreparation is necessary for the precise measurement.SOI wafer surface is exposed to HF vapor, and themetals on the surface are collected as droplet. Toimprove the sensitivity, the volume of collectivesolution should be as tiny as possible and the HF dropsare rolled all over the surface in collective operation. Incase of precious metals, it is better to use other kinds ofcollective solutions instead, since they are not dissolvedor collected by HF solution itself.

Usually, sample solution isvaporized in the nebulizer and then finally introducedinto Argon plasma in the silica tube called torchthrough the spray chamber. The sample is decomposed,evaporated, atomized and then ionized in the Argonplasma. Except for few atoms that have relatively highionization potential, most of the elements (&gt; 90%) canbe ionized. Ions are identified and measured in amountby the mass spectrometer.8.4.4.1 Sample Preparation  The same method asAAS method is applicable. In case of quantitativemeasurement of Fe, since its mass weight is close tothat of ArO +, it is necessary to pay attention to thedegradation of detection sensitivity.8.5 Particle Density (LPD : Light Point Defect )8.5.1 Light Scattering Tomography  The particlelarger than 0.2 m on the thick SOI wafers is countedby Automated particle counter. The particles in theorder of 0.1 m can be detected if top silicon film issufficiently thick.8.5.2 Principle of measurement  By scanning thelaser beam on the wafer surface, the light scattered bythe particles on the wafer is detected. The scatteredlight and the noise from the wafer surface is detected asa direct current, on the other hand, the scattered light bythe particles can be detected as pulse components. Theparticle size can be calibrated with standard polystyrenelatex spheres. Multi-layers of SOI wafers usually havescattering noise from the layer interface. In case of lessthan 1 m of the top silicon film thickness, it isnecessary to reduce incident angle of the laser beam toincrease the reflective component from the surface. Forexample, S/N ratio is improved when using S-polarizedlight of 10 degree incident, 85% of its component isreflected from silicon surface.NOTE 9: In case of SOI wafer (Thickness &gt; 1 m)Particle counter with a vertical incident laser, which is thesame one used for the bulk wafer, is applied. It should benoted that bypass filter to erase the interference signals due tothickness dispersion, and adjustment of photo-multipliersensitivity are necessary. By this technique, it is capable ofdetecting particles (&gt; 0.1m) as much as on the bulk wafer.NOTE 10: In case of SOI wafer (Thickness &lt; 0.5 m) It is recommended to use S - polarized light or normal lightwith low incident angle because of high scattering noise.However, the adjustment of photo-multiplier sensitivity isnecessary to reduce the noise component. The sensitivitydepends on the magnitude of the noise and it is usuallypossible to detect particles of around more than 0.5m (inbulk wafer, &gt; 0.2 m).8.5.3 Visual Inspection  SOI wafer can be visuallyinspected in accordance with ASTM F523. Theautomatic inspection equipment is also used whenavailable. For visual inspection, the collimated highintensity bright light (ex. 500,000 lux) is used. Underusing this light, SOI wafer is inspected for haze, slip,scratches, chips, cracks, pits, dimples, mound, orangepeel, LPD and contamination.8.6 Surface Roughness8.6.1 AFM (Atomic Force Microscope)  Bycontacting the probe equipped with the cantilever ontothe wafer surface of the sample, and by scanning thecantilever and detecting the variation by i.e., opticalmethod, the roughness information is obtained.NOTE 11: It is expected to set the observation area as &gt; 20m  20 m to increase reliability of the data.NOTE 12: Height calibration of concave and convex: Refer toUC standard (Calibration method of 1 m order height inAFM, \[Ultra Clean Technology, Vol. 7, No. 2, pp. 43,1995\]).8.7 Inclusions8.7.1 In bonded SOI wafer, there exists thecontaminants at the bonding Si/SiO2 or SiO 2/SiO 2interface such as particles, metals, boron, andhydrocarbon. Here, inclusions means the contaminants.Although there has been no report on the influence ofcontaminants to the device characteristics, theimprovement of the contamination level is required.8.8 Void8.8.1 Scanning Acoustic Topography  The void canbe detected by means of the traveling time difference ofthe acoustic waves. The void mapping can be made byscanning an ultrasonic wave and detecting the reflectingwave from the both surfaces of the void. Measuring inwater improves the resolving power of location sincethe ultrasonic wave can be tightened by acoustic lenses.NOTE 13: It is not suitable to measure SOI wafer that is notbonded firmly because measurement is conducted in water.NOTE 14: It is not suitable to measure top silicon film (&lt; 7m) because it is impossible to separate reflective waves bothfrom top silicon film surface and the bonding interface.NOTE 15: Detectable void gap depends on acoustic wavefrequency. Detectable void diameter depends on the size ofthe acoustic source and the receiver. For example, if using 75

&lt;!-- Page 7 --&gt;

SEMI M41-1101 © SEMI 2000, 2001 14 MHz frequency, 5 nm void gap and 50 m void diameter canbe detected.NOTE 16: Void is defined as empty space that is due to theimperfect bonding at Si/SiO2 and SiO2/ SiO2 interface. Thisvoid should be discriminated from the splitting at bondingstrength test.NOTE 17: Void can be only evaluated during SOI waferprocessing, not at the shipping. 8.9 Bonding Strength8.9.1 Tensile Testing Method  Bonding strength isdefined and evaluated by tensile strength (kgf/cm2)which is needed to split the bonding interface vertically.Details of the test structure and the test method shouldbe determined by negotiation between wafer users andwafer suppliers.

SEMI M43-0301 © SEMI 20011 SEMI M43-0301GUIDE FOR REPORTING WAFER NANOTOPOGRAPHY This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on November 22, 2000. Initially available at www.semi.org December 2000; to bepublished March 2001. 1 Purpose1.1 This guide provides a framewo rk for reporting ofnanotopography surface features on silicon wafers. 2 Scope2.1 This guide addresses reporting the characterizationof nanotopography surface features found on wafersurfaces. Nanotopography is the non-planar deviationof the whole front wafer surface within a spatialwavelength range of approximately 0.2 to 20 mm andwithin the fixed quality area (FQA). Typical examplesinclude dips, bumps or waves on the wafer surface thatvary in peak to valley height from a few nanometers toa several hundred nanometers.2.2 This guide provides a framewo rk for communi-cating specific values limiting feature levels and/ordensities as agreed upon between suppliers and users.2.2.1 Discussion  Nanotopograph y measurementshave not been needed for 0.25 m generation devices,but are expected to be required for smaller feature sizesto meet CMP requirements. Nanotopography on a wafersurface prior to CMP processes can result in variationsin post-CMP dielectric thickness with potential negativeconsequences for circuit performance and yield;features as small as 20 nm (peak to valley) can result inpost CMP discoloration of dielectrics as a result of localthickness variation of the remaining dielectric 11. Heightvariations over specified distances (determined by CMPissues and/or lithography systems) need to be properlycontrolled to assure that wafers are acceptable forselected process steps. In the case of CMP, the issue iscontrol of film thickness variation introduced bynanotopography. The metrology industry is buildingtools that will measure and map surface features atnanotopography amplitudes and spatial wavelengths.Nanotopography features are characterized by theirheight variation within an area, and are discriminatedfrom other features of similar height by their spatialwavelength range.2.3 This standard does not purport to address safetyissues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish 1 K. V. Ravi, Wafer Flatness Requirements for FutureTechnologies, Future Fab International, July 1999. appropriate safety health practices and determine theapplicability or regulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 The reported surface features w ill be influenced bylimitations and parameters of the measurement tool.These include:3.1.1 The finite surface spatial band width of the tooland the applied filtering will prevent surface variationsoutside the bandwidth of operation from beingmeasured. Also, the finite bandwidth of filteringproduces non-physical artifacts that may be apparent inregions where the power in the rejected bands is high.3.1.2 Bandwidth edges are not alwa ys well defined.Measurement results do not always agree well betweensystems, because different tool designs employ differ-ent geometries and operate them over different spatialbandwidths.3.1.3 All surface profiling measurem ent systems havea minimum height variation sensitivity that will distortsignals near the noise floor.3.1.4 The reported shape of some fe atures may alsodepend on the pixel grid orientation employed by theinstrument.3.1.5 The pixel size and sampled are a will affect thebandwidth limits.3.2 Reported profiles also vary wi th interactionsbetween wafer and tool. These limitations include:3.2.1 Measurements made near the w afer edge mayresult in false readings. Under certain conditions, thismay cause incorrect height measurement within theFQA.3.2.2 Closely spaced features may b e counted as asingle feature, or as no feature, if the pixel size is largerthan the feature, or is larger than the spacing betweenfeatures. Reported features may result from thecombination of the actual surface features, the mannerin which the wafer is chucked, or be caused by particlestrapped between the wafer back surface and the chuck.3.2.3 High-pass (spatial frequency) filtering istypically used with these measurements to remove the(long-spatial wavelength) effects of wafer shape (such

This filtering may affect thereported results.3.3 Nanotopography characterizat ion does not includemicroroughness, which applies to a shorter spatialwavelength range.3.4 The location of defective areas as calculated insection 6 may not coincide with the location of thesurface features that lead to those values. This maycause lack of spatial correlation between reporteddefective areas and device process defect areas.3.5 The height map used to create n anotopographyreports may be affected by wafer shape andmeasurement chuck effects. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M1  Specification for MonocrystallinePolished Silicon WafersNOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be thelatest publications of adopted standards. 5 Terminology5.1 fixed quality area (FQA) \[SEM I M1\]  thecentral area of a wafer surface, defined by a nominaledge exclusion, X over which the specified values of aparameter apply.Discussion: The boundary of the FQA is at all pointsthe distance X away from the periphery of a wafer ofnominal dimensions. (See Figure 1). The size of theFQA is independent of the wafer diameter and flatlength tolerances. For the purpose of defining the FQA,the wafer periphery at locations with notch fiducials isassumed to follow the circumference of a circle withdiameter equal to the nominal wafer diameter. 5.2 nanotopography, of a wafer su rface  the non-planar deviation of a surface within a spatialwavelength range of approximately 0.2 to 20 mm.5.3 nanotopology, of a wafer surfa ce  seenanotopography.5.4 roughness \[SEMI M1\]  the m ore narrowlyspaced components of surface texture.Discussion: These components are considered withindefined limits of spatial wavelength (or frequency). 5.5 spatial wavelength  the spac ing betweenadjacent peaks of a purely sinusoidal profile. 6 Measurements6.1 The height map is obtained fro m a front-surface measurement. An explicit reference plane is not usedfor calculating and assigning values.NOTE 2: Other methods of analyzing nanotopography mayrequire the use of an explicit reference plane. 6.2 The high-pass filter removes lo ng spatialwavelength wafer tilt and topography effects,effectively creating a global reference surface.6.3 Calculation  The calculation determines thepeak to valley height (P-V) variation among the pixelsincluded in the analysis area, and assigns that variationin nanometers to the center of the analysis area. Thecalculation is performed for every analysis area withinthe FQA of the wafer. These calculations may berepeated for analysis areas of different dimension D.NOTE 3: This calculation describes the full-analysis areamethod. There is another calculation, the partial analysisarea method, where the calculation is performed for everyanalysis area whose center pixel is within the FQA of thewafer. The partial analysis area method, not defined in thisdocument, is being addressed by SEMI for inclusion in astandard. 6.4 The following measurement el ements should bereported:6.4.1 Filteringa) Spatial cutoff of high pass filterb) Type of Filterc) Pixel spacingFiltering is used to remove long wavelength shapecomponents from the raw height data. 6.4.2 Analysis Area  Specify this analysis areas:a) Shape, e.g., square, circle, andb) Dimension D of the analysis areaAn analysis area contains a pixel at its center (Figure1).

SEMI M44-0305 © SEMI 2001, 20051 SEMI M44-0305GUIDE TO CONVERSION FACTORS FOR INTERSTITIAL OXYGEN INSILICON This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the Japanese Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved for publication by the Japan RegionalStandards Committee on January 11, 2005. Initially available at www.semi.org January 2005; to bepublished March 2005. Originally published March 2001; previously published July 2002. 1 Purpose1.1 Over the years numerous calibration factors used to calculate the interstitial oxygen content of silicon from thepeak room-temperature infrared absorption at 1107 cm1 have been standardized by several standards developmentorganizations in various parts of the world. All such standards have since been revised to use the IOC-88 calibrationfactor1,2 that more correctly relates the true oxygen content of silicon to the absorption peak. Nevertheless, many ofthe old calibration factors remain in common use throughout the industry.1.2 This guide is a compilation of the conversion and calibration factors used in standards established by variousorganizations since 1970 for the measurement of interstitial oxygen in silicon. 2 Scope2.1 This guide allows the user of the guide to convert quantitative values obtained from one standard to another.2.2 Two tables are included in the guide.2.2.1 Table 1 gives the calibration factors to relate peak absorption coefficient (cm1) to interstitial oxygen contentin both parts per million atomic (ppma) and atoms/cm3 for various standards, all of which have been replaced bynewer revisions.2.2.1.1 These calibration factors are at times referred to by common names as indicated in column 1 of the tablesand at other times by the designation of the (obsolete) standard in which they were standardized (as indicated in thefootnotes to Table 1). Despite the fact that there is a test method associated with each calibration factor, the detailedprocedures in these test methods are usually ignored in common practice and measurements are most frequentlymade with automated (black-box) instruments that have internal algorithms. Thus, reference to a particular standardmost often indicates only the value of the calibration factor to be used.2.2.2 Table 2 gives the conversion factors to convert oxygen concentration of one standard to oxygen concentrationof another standard.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI M59  Terminology for Silicon TechnologySEMI MF1188  Test Method for Interstitial Atomic Oxygen Content of Silicon by Infrared Absorption with ShortBaseline 1 Baghdadi, A., Bullis, W.

SEMI M46-1101 E © SEMI 20011 SEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS INEPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING This test method was technically approved by the Global Compound Semiconductor Committee and is thedirect responsibility of the European Compound Semiconductor Materials Committee. Current editionapproved by the European Regional Standards Committee on June 29, 2001. Initially available atwww.semi.org December 2001; to be published March 2002.E This document was editorially modified in November 2001 to correct a typographical error. A change wasmade to Section 7.3.3. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this document is to specify amethod to measure the carrier concentration and carrierconcentration vs. depth profile of epitaxial layers byElectrochemical Capacitance Voltage ECV profiling. 2 Scope2.1 This test method covers a procedure for measuringthe carrier concentration of epitaxial layers by ECVprofiling. This method focuses on improving theaccuracy and repeatability of the measurement bystandardizing the test conditions and reporting and byroutine calibration of the measurement.2.2 This test method is intended to cover the majorityof routine samples measured. However, because of thenumber of different materials encountered it cannotcover every contingency.2.3 This standard may involve hazardous materials.This standard does not purport to address safety issues,if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility ofthe users of this standard to establish appropriate safetyand health practices and determine the applicability ofregulatory limitations prior to use. 3 Referenced Standards3.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI C1  Specifications for Reagents3.2 ASTM StandardsD1125-95 (1999)  Standard Test Methods forElectrical Conductivity and Resistivity of Water 4 Terminology4.1 bias  the potential applied to the sample withrespect to a reference electrode.4.2 capacitance voltage CV measurements  electricalmeasurements where the capacitance of a rectifyingbarrier is measured as a function of applied bias and is ameasure of the net fixed ionized charge per unitvolume. 4.3 carrier concentration  the net fixed ionizedcharge per unit volume. Equal to the free carrierconcentration if the dopant is fully ionized and thematerial is free of traps.4.4 current voltage IV measurements  electricalmeasurements where the current through the rectifyingbarrier is measured as a function of applied bias.4.5 dissipation factor  the ratio of the real part to theimaginary part of the complex admittance. It is ameasure of the non-ideality of the barrier.4.6 electrochemical  chemical reaction in whichcharge transfer takes place via an external circuit.4.7 epitaxial layer  a layer of single crystalsemiconductor material grown on a host substratewhich determines its orientation.4.8 excess area  the difference between the wettedand illuminated areas.4.9 flatband potential  the intercept on the voltageaxis of the 1/C2 vs V plot. A measure of the built infield or barrier height.4.10 illuminated area  the area of the sample whichcan be illuminated during electrochemical etching.4.11 rectifying barrier  a potential gradient formedat the junction between two materials which permits theflow of charge in one direction only.4.12 reference electrode  half cell which has aconstant electrode potential, such as a saturated calomelelectrode, SCE.4.13 rest potential  the open circuit potential of thesample with respect to the reference electrode.4.14 wetted area  the area of contact between theelectrolyte and the sample. 5 Summary of Method5.1 In this method, the carrier concentration of theepitaxial layer is measured by the CV method.5.1.1 Ohmic contacts are formed on the sample.

&lt;!-- Page 26 --&gt;

SEMI M46-1101 E © SEMI 2001 2 5.1.2 A rectifying barrier, of known contact area, isformed by placing the sample in contact with anelectrolyte.5.1.3 The quality of the barrier is assessed using I-Vand C-V measurements.5.1.4 From the measured C-V data the carrierconcentration of the layer is determined.5.1.5 The sample is anodically etched to produce a newbarrier deeper in the material. The etch depth isdetermined using Faradays law of electrolysis.5.1.6 Sections 5.1.4 and 5.1.5 are repeated to generatea carrier concentration vs. depth profile. 6 Interferences6.1 Thin Layers  Diffusion of carriers into adjacentregions set a fundamental resolution limit to themeasurement. In addition if the layer has a high sheetresistivity this can also affect the value obtained.6.2 Double Layer Capacitance  A limitationimposed by the physical nature of theelectrolyte/semiconductor barrier which sets an upperlimit to the measured carrier concentration, for accuratemeasurements, of 1  10 19 cm-3. The technique can beused beyond this value, but with progressivedegradation.6.3 Etch Well Uniformity6.3.1 Etch Well Flatness  Non-uniformity increasesthe effective area and may result in the measurementnot being wholly made in the layer of interest. Themain causes of non-uniformity are gas bubbles,inadequate electrolyte circulation and unevenillumination.6.3.2 Etch Well Roughness  indicates poor etchingand has a deleterious effect on the measurements.Generally overcome by selecting a more appropriateelectrolyte and/or etching conditions.6.4 Non-Ideal Electrical Characteristics6.4.1 Series Resistance  From the contacts, sampleand electrolyte affect the accuracy of the measurements.This effect is minimized by using a highly conductiveelectrolyte, making large area ohmic contacts and byemploying a low measurement frequency.6.4.2 Leakage Currents  Parallel conduction canaffect the accuracy of the measurement. Its influence isreduced by employing a high measurement frequency.6.4.3 Large Excess Area  Can give rise to errors onn-type material particularly when profiling Hi-Lostructures. The excess area is electrolyte dependent butis mainly affected by the quality of the seal used to define the area. Large excess areas indicate a poor sealand are corrected by replacing the seal.6.5 Hi-Lo Structures  Measurement is subject toinaccuracy due to carrier diffusion and excess areaerrors. For accurate measurements, chemically etch tothe layer of interest before measurement.6.6 Contact Quality  Non-Ohmic or high resistancecontacts have a deleterious effect on the measurement.Contacts should be checked by measuring the resistancebetween two similar contacts and then reversing thecurrent direction and repeating the measurement.6.7 Surface and Deep States  Cause the measuredcapacitance to be frequency dependent and/ordependent on the rate at which the bias is changed.Usually resolved by using a high measurementfrequency. This should not be confused with thefrequency dependence which is more usually attributedto high series resistance.6.8 Surface Films  Have a deleterious effect on thecapacitance measurement. Film formation should beavoided by using an appropriate electrolyte, control ofthe etching bias and time and by electrolyte circulation.6.9 Surface Roughness  The surface of the sampleshould be smooth and free of features that would affectthe action of the seal.6.10 Light  Light can affect the capacitancemeasurement, so the sample must be placed in a darkenvironment during the measurement.6.11 Sample Loading  The accuracy of themeasurement depends on the repeatability of the area. Ifa compliant seal is involved, such as a plastic ring, thesample should be held in contact with the seal byapplying a controlled and constant force. No relativelateral movement should take place during the loadingprocess.6.12 Ring Variability  The condition of the ring has alarge effect on the measurement. Good seals will have asmall to zero excess area and exhibit a well defined andreproducible contact area. 7 Apparatus7.1 Measurement of Etch Well and Ring Areas Measuring microscope with either an XY stage, with alinear resolution of 0.01 mm or better, or a camera andimage processing system capable of measuring an areaof 0.1 cm2 to better than 0.5%.7.2 Measurement of Etch Well Flatness  (Optional)A means such as a stylus profiler for checking theflatness and roughness of the etch well. In most casesvisual inspection of the etch well, for a mirror likeappearance, is sufficient indication of low roughness.

The measurementfrequency should be typically between 1 and 100 kHz.7.3.2 Equivalent Circuit Model  The meter shouldassume a parallel circuit model for theelectrolyte/semiconductor interface and provisionshould be made to compensate for the large seriesresistance of the electrolyte and contacts.7.3.3 Potentiostat  Capable of maintaining thepotential of the sample with respect to a referenceelectrode constant to ±5mV during the measurementand with a reference input impedance of &gt; 10 13 Ohms.7.3.4 Light Source  A source of uniform illuminationof above band gap energy for etching n-type materials.7.4 Sample Holder7.4.1 Electrochemical Cell  Used to hold the sample,contain the electrolyte and support the sealing ring andother electrodes, see Figure 1.7.4.1.1 Sealing Ring  A corrosion resistant ringwhich forms a seal between the electrolyte and thesample. This ring defines the measurement area whichshould be reproducible and well defined. The ring areashould not be less than 0.008 cm2 and thereproducibility between runs should be better than ±3%. Large ring areas (typically ≥ 0.1 cm2) are preferredfor more accurate measurements.7.4.1.2 Reference Electrode  Used to control thesample bias via a potentiostat.7.4.1.3 Counter Electrode  The bias and test signalsare applied between this electrode and the sample.

Prepareall electrolytes in a fume hood.9.2 Ensure that all electrolytes are correctly labeled. 10 Specimen Preparation10.1 The sample should be free from surface debrisand scratches. The sample should be cleaned withdeionized (DI) water and dried.10.2 To measure a single layer or upper layer of amultilayered structure, no additional sample preparationis required.10.3 For a buried layer in a multilayered structure,measurement accuracy is improved by removing theoverlaying layers by either the use of selective orcontrolled chemical etches.10.4 If the upper layers cannot be removed bychemical etching then the sample can be profiledelectrochemically but in some cases this may reduce theaccuracy of the method.10.5 For conducting substrates Ohmic contacts shouldbe made to either the front or back of the wafer. Forinsulating substrates an Ohmic contact should be madeto the front of the epilayer. Contacts are formedelectrically, by alloying or by any other suitablemethod. The quality of the contact should be verifiedelectrically. 11 Calibration and Standardization11.1 Sealing Ring  Calibration of the sealing ringareas is performed using a blue slice, made bygrowing an anodic oxide film on a polished n-typesubstrate.11.1.1 The blue slice is profiled according to this testmethod. Etch only the minimum amount necessary tosee the illuminated area (typically 0.5 m). Flush thecell several times with DI water before removing thesample. Wash and measure the sample as soon aspossible.11.1.2 Wetted Area  The wetted area is observed dueto chemical attack of the oxide film and is measuredusing a measuring microscope with cross hair eye-pieces and micrometer XY stage or by using a zoomcamera and image processing system.11.1.3 Illuminated Area  Etches in the light andforms a well defined etch well, which is measured asper the wetted area.11.1.4 Calibration Interval  Regularly check the areaand condition of the sealing ring. For daily use, the ringareas should be calibrated at least three times a week. 11.1.5 Replacement  Rings should be replaced if theexcess area exceeds 10% for rings of area ≤ 0.05 cm2 or5% for rings of area &gt; 0.05 cm2 or if the perimeter isnot uniform.11.1.6 Alternative Calibration Method  The areascan be measured using known n and p-type testsamples. This method is best suited for continualmonitoring of the ring area between blue slicecalibrations.11.2 Instrumentation  The bias voltage,measurement frequency and capacitance measurementshould be checked annually.11.2.1 Bias  The bias voltage should be checkedwith a DVM with an input impedance &gt; 1 MOhm.11.2.2 Capacitance  The capacitance measurementshould be checked using calibrated fixed valuecapacitors covering the expected sample capacitancerange or from 1100 nF.11.2.3 Frequency  The measurement frequencyshould be checked with a frequency counter. 12 Measurement Procedure12.1 Choice of Electrolyte  An electrolyte should beselected that forms a rectifying barrier with the sample,gives a flat, mirror finish etch well and generates only asmall excess area.12.2 Sample Mounting  A region of the sampleshould be defined which will form the rectifyingcontact with the electrolyte. This area can be defined bysome form of sealing ring or mask, but it is importantthat the area of contact between the electrolyte and thesample be precisely known and remain constant duringthe measurement.12.2.1 Sealing Ring  If the sample is pressed againsta sealing ring, the seal must be cleaned with DI waterand dried before positioning the sample. If the sampleneeds repositioning, the sample and sealing ring shouldbe recleaned and dried.12.2.2 Ring Loading  As the mounting pressure mayeffect the reproducibility of the measurement and thelifetime of the sealing ring, it must be controlled (e.g.by the reproducible use of a suitable compressionspring).12.3 Cell Filling and Debubbling  Fill the cell,which holds the sealing ring and other measurementelectrodes, with the electrolyte. The process of fillingthe cell frequently traps bubbles of air on the surface ofthe sample. These bubbles must be removed before ameasurement can be made.

Its value usuallylies between 0 and 1 V (respective to a SCE referenceelectrode). Values outside this range can indicate aproblem with the sample or reference electrode.12.6 Cable Compensation  Determine any straycapacitance or additional resistance associated with thecell and test leads that would impact the measurement.12.7 Current vs. Voltage (I-V)  Used to select thebias for measurement and etching and as a general testof material quality.12.7.1 Measurement Bias  is set in the reverse bias,low dark current region.12.7.2 Etching Bias (p-type material)  is set in theforward bias region. The abruptness of the forward biasbreakdown is indicative of the ohmic nature of thecontacts. No or shallow forward breakdown oftenindicates unsuitable ohmic contacts.12.7.3 Etching Bias (n-type material)  is set in thereverse bias, low dark current region. Illuminationshould result in a significant increase in current (photo-current).12.8 Capacitance vs. Voltage (C-V)  Used toevaluate the quality of the electrochemical diode and toselect a range of possible measurement voltages. Themeasured flatband potential (respective to a SCEreference electrode) should lie between 0.5 and2.5 V for n-type semiconductors and between 1 and+1 V for p-type semiconductors.12.8.1 Measurement Bias  is set in a region of lowdissipation, where the 1/C2 vs V plot is linear. Forlayers grown with concentration gradients, the lattercondition cannot be strictly adhered to and in suchcases the amplitude of the test signal, used forcapacitance measurement, should be kept as small aspossible.12.8.2 Dissipation  The normally accepted safe levelis &lt; 0.4.12.8.3 Excess Area Capacitance  For n-type surfacelayers the capacitance of the electrolyte/semiconductorinterface is measured prior to etching and thecapacitance associated with the excess area is computedby multiplying the measured capacitance by the ratio ofthe excess area to the wetted area. 12.9 Carrier Concentration Profiling  Profile thesample using the etching and measurement conditionsdetermined from the I-V and C-V data.12.9.1 Carrier Concentration  The carrierconcentration is determined from the C-V data.12.9.2 Excess Area Correction  For n-type materialthe capacitance associated with material in the excessarea should be subtracted from the measuredcapacitance.12.9.3 Etching  The sample is anodically etched atthe etching bias. The depth of the etch well isdetermined from the time integral of the current usingFaradays law of electrolysis.12.9.4 Profiled Depth  The profile assumes that themeasured carrier concentration lies at a depth equal tothe sum of the etch and the depletion depths.12.10 Ring Area  It is advised to measure the etchwell area after profiling and to use this value torecalculate the carrier concentration vs. depth profile. 13 Calculations and Interpretation of Results13.1 Carrier Concentration, NThe principle of this method is based on measuring theslope of 1/C2 vs V.

&lt;!-- Page 36 --&gt;

SEMI M47-0704 © SEMI 2001, 2004 6 reflectometry, have proven useful both for surfacesilicon layer and buried oxide (BOX) layer thicknessmeasurements. Both techniques use reflected light toallow deduction of the thickness and refractive index ofthin layers. In both cases, layer thickness and index ofrefraction data must be backed out of the measuredoptical data by a process of successive approximation.Silicon islands in the BOX layer of SIMOX andinterface non-uniformity make these techniques lessreliable.8.1.1.1 Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE) Measurement In this measurement, white light from a xenon arclamp passes through a polarizing rotating filter andilluminates the sample site under study; reflected lightpasses through an analyzer to a monochrometer andphotomultiplier detector. For each wavelength,reflectivity oscillates with polarizer rotation; themagnitude and phase of reflectivity changes aremeasured to determine ellipsometric angles,  and .The two measured spectra are fit by successiveapproximation to allow determination of the surfacesilicon layer and BOX layer thickness and oxidecomposition. For SE, the choice of instrument andassociated model and fitting parameters affect theconfidence-of-fit, so they should be taken into accountin the user-supplier agreement.8.1.1.2 Spectroscopic Reflectometry Measurement In this measurement, light from a xenon arc lamppasses through a grating monochrometer or opticalband-pass filters and illuminates the sample site understudy; reflected light is gathered by a detector. Specularreflectivity is plotted as a function of wavelength from0.4 m to 1.1 m. The analysis proceeds by makingsuccessively better approximations to index ofrefraction and absorption of each layer until anacceptable fit is achieved. Measurements are made witha reflectance mode optical interferometer.8.1.1.3 Optical Model Fitting and Correlation There are slight, systematic differences between layerthickness measured by SE and spectroscopicreflectometry. Because of this, users and suppliersshould specify the actual measurement method to beused. The two methods offer results which arereproducible and well-correlated with each other over awide range of conditions. If both measurementtechniques are used, it is recommended that thereflectance system measurements should be calibratedto fit the results of the SE.8.1.2 Measurement Positions  The measurementstrategy is to make a detailed measurement with anaccurate fit on at least nine wafer sites, for example, thewafer center, four points at half of the wafer radius andfour points at 10 mm from the wafer edge. The numberand position of wafer sites to be monitored should be agreed on between users and suppliers. Generally, thegreater the variability relative to the mean, the largerthe number of sites that should be monitored. In eachcase, the measurement system supplies a goodness-of-fit" parameter that indicates a level of confidence in thefit to the measured data.8.1.3 Surface Silicon Layer and Buried Oxide (BOX)Layer Thickness  Spectra for each site are fitindependently with both the surface silicon and BOXlayer thickness as adjustable parameters. Both the meanthickness and the uniformity should be specified.8.1.4 Surface Silicon Thickness Mean Value Variation8.1.4.1 After surface silicon layer thickness ismeasured for predetermined number of wafers andmean value of surface silicon thickness is derived foreach wafer, the maximum and the minimum values arechosen, and then the variation (nm) is calculated as;± (Maximum mean value  Minimum mean value) / 28.1.4.2 In case of quite large number of wafers (ex. afew hundreds), the variation (mm) can be calculated as;± 3 (3 times of the standard deviation)under agreement between users and suppliers.8.1.5 Surface Silicon Thickness Variation in Wafer8.1.5.1 After surface silicon layer thickness ismeasured at predetermined number of points within anSOI wafer, the maximum and the minimum values arechosen, and then the variation (nm) is calculated as ;± (Maximum value  Minimum value) / 28.1.5.2 In case of multi-points measurements (ex. a fewhundreds) within an SOI wafer, the variation (nm) canbe calculated as;± 3 (3 times of the standard deviation)under agreement between users and suppliers.8.1.6 Buried Oxide (BOX) Thickness Variation8.1.6.1 After BOX thickness is measured forpredetermined number of points on predeterminednumber of wafers, the maximum and the minimumvalues are chosen, and then the variation (%) iscalculated as;± (Maximum value  Minimum value)  100 / (2 mean value)8.1.6.2 In case of multi-points measurements (ex. a fewhundreds) within an SOI wafer or quite large number ofwafers (ex. a few hundreds), the variation (%) can becalculated as;± 3 (3 times of the standard deviation)  100 / (meanvalue)under agreement between users and suppliers.

SEMI M47-0704 © SEMI 2001, 20047 8.2 Dopant Concentration8.2.1 Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) isutilized to determine dopant concentration in surfacesilicon layer.8.2.2 The acceptable dopant concentrations are to bedetermined by agreement between users and suppliers.8.3 Defects in Surface Silicon Layer8.3.1 SOI Etch Pit8.3.1.1 Defects in surface silicon layer includingstacking faults, threading dislocations and other crystaldefects are evaluated by destructive chemical etchingand microscopic etch pit density measurements. Theappropriate evaluation procedure for SOI wafers, whichdepends on type of defects targeted and thickness ofsurface silicon layers, is determined by agreementbetween users and suppliers.8.3.1.2 Following are examples of the evaluation onSIMOX wafers and bonded wafers.8.3.1.3 Example 1  SOI etch pit evaluation inSIMOX wafers: Samples are first immersed in HF toremove oxide from the surface. Then the samples areetched by Secco etch. In the case of a relatively thickSOI layer such as 170200 nm, freshly preparedstandard Secco Etch can be used: one part (by volume)of a 0.15 molar solution of K 2Cr 3O 7 in distilled waterand two parts HF (49%). In the case of a thin SOI layerbelow 100 nm, the samples are etched for 30 seconds inthe solution5 : 50 ml of HF (49%) plus 80 ml of HNO 3(61%) plus 160 ml of H 2O \[K 2Cr2O 7 1g +Cu(NO 3) 23H 2O 4g\] (a sort of diluted Secco etch). Forboth cases, the etching should continue until 50 nm ofthe surface Si remains. After the etching and rinsing inwater, samples are dipped in HF (49%) for 5 minutes.The HF etches the buried oxide and creates cavitiesunder the etch pits. The number of etch pits is countedthrough optical microscope. The etch pits includevarious defects such as threading dislocations andstacking fault pyramid.8.3.1.4 Example 2  SOI etch pit evaluation in bondedSOI wafers fabricated by delamination followed byCMP: SOI etch pit density increases when remainingSOI thickness after Secco etching is thinner andthinner. SOI layers thicker than 150 nm are usuallyetched down to 50 nm by Secco etching before SOIetch pits are counted. These pits are detected whenselectively etched depth or the size of defects is largerthan SOI layer thickness remaining after Secco etching.Thus, damages deeper than 50 nm or defects larger than50 nm can be detected. These pits come from defects 5 L. F. Giles, A. Nejim, and P. L. F. Hemment, Materials Chemistryand Physics, vol.35, p. 129, 1993. contained in original silicon material and/or damages ordefects induced in SOI fabrication process. The formerincludes COP, bulk micro defects, oxygen precipitates,and so on. The latter includes CMP damages, defectsinduced by heat cycles and so on, as possibility. Todefine origins of SOI etch pits, their distribution indepth of SOI layers and/or that on a wafer should beevaluated. For example, CMP damages may belocalized on surface of SOI layers. By etching SOIsurfaces up to desired depth with using non-selectiveetching such as KOH followed by Secco etching, etchpits due to CMP damages disappear. The depthdistribution of defects or damages can be evaluated inthis manner.6 8.3.1.5 Example 3  SOI etch pit evaluation in bondedSOI wafers formed by epitaxial layer transfertechnology: In this case, there is no COP, bulk microdefects, and oxygen precipitates in the SOI layerbecause it is made of epitaxially grown Si on porous Si.In addition, mechanical damage related defect is notintroduced, since the SOI surface is smoothed out byhydrogen annealing instead of polishing. The majordefect in this type of SOI wafers is same sidedpyramidal stacking fault, that is induced at the initialstage of the epitaxy, and is grown through the epitaxywith upside-down pyramidal shape7, and then is turnedupside-down again by bonding. This defect is decoratedas the etch pit by standard or diluted Seccos etching asdescribed in Example 1 in conjunction with HFdipping. It is enough to etch until 50 nm of the SOIlayer remaining to etch the defect portion through theSOI layer selectively by the defect etching such asSecco etching because the stacking fault penetratesthrough the SOI layer. The following HF dippingetches the BOX through the etch pit to form largecavity. It helps to count low density of defects in a wideobservation area with low magnification microscope.8.3.2 Threading Dislocation8.3.2.1 The etching of the SIMOX sample shownabove in Section 8.3.1.3 (Example 1) is terminatedwhen the remaining surface silicon layer thickness is1/31/2 of the initial thickness and then dipped in HF asthe same manner as Example 1. In this case the etchpits include mainly threading dislocations only whichcan be counted through optical microscope.8.3.3 HF Defect8.3.3.1 Measurement of the microscopic etch pitdensity following an HF etch is commonly used todisclose defects in SOI material.

SEMI M47-0704 © SEMI 2001, 2004 8 silicon may be present before the HF etch or be causedby HF etching. For this destructive measurement, awhole wafer or at least one quarter of a wafer should beused. The sample is placed in concentrated (49%) HFfor 10 to 15 minutes or diluted (e.g. 25%) HF for longertime (e.g. 3 to 4 hours), then removed, rinsed and dried.If there are pits or voids and/or metal particles orsilicides formed in the surface silicon layer, the HFetches the metals/silicides and then etch the buriedoxide. This results in local etching of BOX with 2550m diameter (depending on the HF concentration andthe etch time) centered on the original defects. Thedefect density is then measured in an opticalmicroscope using a 5 objective and 10 eyepiece orcomparable setup. The samples should be scanned forwhole surface within edge exclusion boundary.8.3.4 Void8.3.4.1 Voids are determined as an unbonded area onbonded SOI wafers. See SEMI M41. Because SOI layerin thin bonded SOI wafers are typically 0.2 m thick orthinner, void areas are broken and SOI layers as well asBOX are usually absent. By this reason, voids arespecified as local absence of SOI layers and/or BOX inbonded wafers in this specification.8.3.4.2 Visual inspection  Under visible light, theedge of voids is detected because the edge area is step-shaped due to absence of SOI layers and/or BOXlayers. See Section 8.8 for inspection conditions.8.3.4.3 Detection as large LLS  The edge of localabsence of SOI layer and/or BOX scatters light.Therefore, voids are detected as large LLS. See Section8.7.2 for the principle. A size of LLS corresponding tovarious sizes of voids should be calibrated or correlatedby comparison of defects one by one using amicroscope.8.4 Surface Roughness8.4.1 AFM (Atomic Force Microscope)  Bycontacting the probe equipped with the cantilever ontothe wafer surface of the sample, and by scanning thecantilever and detecting the variation by opticalmethod, the roughness information is obtained. Atapping mode is commonly used.8.5 Metal Contamination8.5.1 The surface metal contamination can bemeasured by TXRF, AAS and ICP-MS methods.8.5.2 TXRF (Total X-Ray Fluorescence)  Total X-rayFluorescence uses a low angle incident, and a tightlycollimated X-ray beam excites the characteristic X-raysfrom impurity atoms near the sample surface. Usually,the angle of X-ray incidence is less than 0.1 degree. Theelement identification and the amount of the element can be obtained by measuring energy and intensities offluorescence X-ray. The instrument provides a map ofimpurity element distribution. Surface roughness maychange metal detection sensitivity. Thus, calibration issuggested before samples with deferent level ofroughness, e.g. back surface, are measured. A referencefor details is SEMI MF1526.8.5.3 AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy)8.5.3.1 The elemental characteristic absorption of theatom is measured by introducing sample solution asaerosol into the flame and then spectral absorptionthrough the flame from the light source is detected bythe spectrometer. The flameless method, superior to theflame method in the sensitivity, is now broadly used.8.5.3.2 Sample Preparation  Careful samplepreparation is necessary for the precise measurement.SOI wafer surface is exposed to HF vapor, and metalson the surface are collected as droplet. To improvesensitivity, the volume of collective solution should beas small as possible and HF drops are rolled all over thesurface in collective operation. In case of preciousmetals, it is better to use other kinds of collectivesolutions instead, since they are not dissolved orcollected by HF solution itself.Examples:1. For Cu ; HF-H2O 2 (HF (50 wt.%) : H 2O 2 (31wt.%): H 2O = 1 : 17 : 82 volume ratio)2. For Au and Pt ; aqua regia (HNO 3 (68 wt.%) : HCl(36 wt.%) = 1 : 3 volume ratio)8.5.4 ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma MassSpectroscopy)8.5.4.1 ICP-MS is composed of ICP (InductivelyCoupled Plasma) part as an ion source and MS (MassSpectrometer) part, which measures the ions generatedat ICP part. Usually, sample solution is vaporized in thenebulizer and then finally introduced into Argon plasmain the silica tube called torch through the spraychamber. The sample is decomposed, evaporated,atomized and then ionized in the Argon plasma. Exceptfor few atoms that have relatively high ionizationpotential, most of the elements (&gt; 90%) can be ionized.Ions are identified and measured in amount by the massspectrometer.8.5.4.2 Sample Preparation  The same method asAAS method is applicable. In case of quantitativemeasurement of Fe, since its mass weight is close tothat of ArO + , it is necessary to pay attention todegradation of detection sensitivity.

SEMI M47-0704 © SEMI 2001, 20049 8.6 BOX Defect8.6.1 BOX Pinhole Measurement-1 (by CuSO4 platingor copper decoration)8.6.1.1 BOX pinhole evaluations shall be made byCuSO 4 plating or copper decoration methods. They canbe also evaluated by BOX capacitor dielectricbreakdown, the details of which are explained later inBOX Pinhole Measurement-2.8.6.1.2 In evaluation by CuSO 4 plating method, thesample wafer is placed (front face down) on a papertowel soaked in 20% CuSO 4 solution on top of a copperplate. An aluminum plate is placed on the back of thewafer. The copper plate is grounded, and 25 V DC isapplied to the aluminum plate. Small leakage currents(sub-A) through pinholes in the BOX cause copper toplate out onto the towel with the density same as BOXpinhole density.8.6.1.3 In evaluation by copper decoration method, anSOI layer is first etched off by KOH solution to exposea BOX layer. Then the wafer is immersed in methanoland brought downward into direct contact with thegold-coated cathode. A copper mesh as an anode isimmersed in the liquid 5 mm above the wafer. Requiredvoltage is applied, such as the electric field in theburied oxide layer is 1 MV/cm. The voltage ismeasured at the oxide surface with a surface voltageprobe. Localized copper decorations at pinhole sites inthe oxide are observed with a low power opticalmicroscope.8.6.2 BOX Capacitor Dielectric Breakdown  Thisparameter can be measured with BOX capacitor. TheBOX thickness affects both the test procedure (such ascapacitor area and voltage criterion) and the allowablevalues of measured parameters. These should bedetermined by agreement between users and suppliers.8.6.2.1 Test Structure  BOX capacitor utilizingmesa-etched SOI layers and Si substrates for bothelectrodes to apply electric field to the embedded buriedoxide is used. The area of capacitor, which affects thebreakdown voltage, should be determined by agreementbetween users and suppliers. Typical capacitor area is0.010.1 cm2. The electrode material and thicknessaffect the breakdown phenomena due to thermal effects,and so should be included in the agreement.8.6.2.2 Test Method: Staircase I-V Measurement Voltage is stepped in one-volt increments from zero tountil destructive breakdown is sensed. The test detectsthe onset of high field conduction, as well as the pointof destructive or massive charge injection and trapping. 8.6.3 BOX Pinhole Measurement-2 (by DielectricBreakdown)8.6.3.1 Buried oxide pinhole can be detected also byBOX capacitor.8.6.3.2 Test Structure  BOX capacitor having an areaequal to or greater than 0.05 cm2.8.6.3.3 Test Method: Staircase I-V  Measurementtesting can be done for both Type I and Type II defectswhere Type I defects are silicon pipes traversing theburied oxide, and Type II defects are local regions ofthin buried oxide. If Type II defect density is sought,capacitors are subjected to a series of 30 voltage stepsof 3.3 volts, with current monitored after each step,using a failure criterion of 1 nA.8.6.3.4 Any capacitor displaying the failure current ormore for applied field less than 2 MV/cm is considereddefective. Defect density of either type is calculatedfrom the yield of good capacitors, (Y = 1  # failed/#tested), using Poisson statistics;D = 1n (Y)/A,where A is the total area of the capacitors tested.8.7 Particle (LLS : Localized Light Scatterer)8.7.1 Light Scattering Tomography  The particlelarger than predetermined threshold size is counted byan automated particle counter.8.7.2 Principle of Measurement  By scanning thelaser beam on the wafer surface, the light scattered byparticles on a wafer is detected. The scattered light andthe noise from the wafer surface is detected as a directcurrent, on the other hand, the scattered light by theparticles can be detected as pulse components. Theparticle size can be calibrated with standard polystyrenelatex spheres. SOI wafers usually have scattering noisefrom the layer interface. It is necessary to reduceincident angle of the laser beam to increase thereflective component from the surface. For example,S/N ratio is improved when using S-polarized light of10 degree incident, 85% of its component is reflectedfrom silicon surface.NOTE 2: Detailed procedure of size calibration with standardpolystyrene latex spheres: Refer to ASTM F1620.NOTE 3: Measurement procedure should be determined byagreement between users and suppliers.8.8 Visual Inspection  SOI wafer can be visuallyinspected in accordance with SEMI MF523. Theautomatic inspection equipment is also used whenavailable. For visual inspection, the collimated highintensity bright light (e.g. 500,000 lux) is used. Underusing this light, SOI wafer is inspected for haze, slip,

SEMI M48-1101 © SEMI 2001 2 5 Terminology5.1 blanket polish  polishing of material depositedon an unpatterned silicon substrate.5.2 diameter scan  measurements of material on awafer taken along a specified diameter. The diameterscan is useful in determining the thickness profile of thematerial on the wafer surface.5.3 edge scan  measurements of material taken alonga specified radial segment in the edge region of thewafer. A series of edge scans can be employed todetermine circumferential thickness profile.5.3.1 Discussion  the data density for edge scanmeasurements is generally higher than for othermeasurements. Combining a low-density diameterscan in the central region of the wafer with a higher-density edge scan, taken along the same scan line, canimprove throughput with appropriate localmeasurement data density.5.4 film total thickness variation (film TTV)  the totalthickness variation (Thk max  Thk min) of film materialamong a set of measurement points.5.4.1 Discussion  The variation may pertain to aregion within a wafer, a complete wafer or multiplewafers with a single polish head, or multiple waferswith multiple polish heads. These wafer and headcombinations must be considered in planning andcomparing measurements. If one assumes that a givenwafer is polished by a subset of the tool heads (typicallyone), a hierarchical relationship exists such that wafersmust be associated with the (tool head) subsets used topolish them. Another way to look at this is, if head isconsidered an experimental treatment, then a waferpolished by one head will be assumed to be treateddifferently than a wafer polished by a different head.This relationship leads to what is known as a hierarchicor nested model. (In this case, one says that wafer isnested within head). A more complete model wouldalso treat head as a fixed effect, wafer random andnested within head, and error as nested with head andwafer. A random effect indicates that the observationcomes from a random sample of a larger population.Head is a fixed effect because the entire population ofheads (i.e., all the heads on the tools) constitutes theentire population of interest. Given this model,variance components would be used to estimate thedifferent sources of variation. In this case, the samplestandard deviation underestimates the populationstandard deviation. Historically, the expected value ofthe variance components is equal to the populationstandard deviation. This is not the case for the samplestandard deviation. 5.5 head to head removal rate non-uniformity(HTHNU)  this metric is useful when evaluatingpolishing processes on a multi-head tool configuration.It is the standard deviation (1) of the removal ratevariation from polish head (HTH) to polish head for afixed number of wafers where the number of wafers runfor each head must be equal. It is expressed as follows: H T H N U = ( R R R R H T H )k211 =kp p 1)Where k is the head indexer and p is the total number ofheads. kRR is the average within wafer removal rate ofhead k. HTHRR is the head to head wafer removal rateaveraged across all wafers and all heads. Themeasurement site locations on each wafer must beidentical for all wafers sampled.It may also be expressed as a percentage of the averagehead to head removal rate: ) % HTHNU = RR k RR HTH RR HTHx 100 k = 1 p p  1( 2 2)5.6 removal rate (RR)  the amount of materialremoved per unit time during the polish process. Atany given point i on the wafer, the removal rate isexpressed by RR Thk pre Thk postPolish timeii i=  3)5.7 thickness, prepolish (Thkpre )  the thickness ofmaterial on an incoming blanket film wafer prior topolish.5.8 thickness, post-polish (Thkpost )  the thickness ofmaterial remaining at a measurement site on a siliconsubstrate after completion of the polish process.5.9 wafer to wafer (WTW) variation  the variationacross multiple wafers at site locations where thelocations on each wafer are identical for all waferssampled.5.10 wafer to wafer removal rate nonuniformity(WTWNU)  a measure of the wafer to wafer removalrate variation. It is the standard deviation (1) of theremoval rate variation wafer to wafer over a polish run

The averageremoval rate for such a group of wafers is expressed as: Average WTW RR RR RRmWTWj = =j m 1 4)where j is the wafer indexer and m is the total numberof wafers within the group. A typical number for m is ≥25.The measurement site locations on each wafer must beidentical for all wafers sampled.

It isthe standard deviation (1) of the removal rate withinthe wafer and is expressed as follows: W IW NU =( RR i RR W IW ) 21 =in n  18)where i is the site indexer, n is the total number ofmeasurement sites on the wafer and WIWRR is theaverage within wafer removal rate.

Tables R-1 and R-2 in RelatedInformation 1 recommend specifications for wafergeometry that can minimize the effects of suchgeometry on the CMP process test.6.2.3 Record bow, warp and other wafer geometrycharacteristics.6.2.4 Wafers can be laser-marked for ease of tracking.Data taken in this mark area should be excluded fromthe process analysis. It is desirable that all wafers in anevaluation lot contain marks at the same nominallocations.6.3 Incoming Film Properties6.3.1 Record the incoming film type and depositiontool and, where applicable, the deposition processconditions.6.3.2 Ascertain that the incoming film thickness issufficient to prevent polishing through to the substrate.See Tables R-1 and R-2 in Related Information 1 forrecommended values for incoming film thickness.6.4 Post-process Measurements6.4.1 Record bow, warp and the same other wafergeometry characteristics determined in Section 6.2.3.NOTE 2: These post-process measurement values may varyarbitrarily relative to the pre-process values.

Base thesebreak-in procedures on recommendations from theconsumable supplier.6.7 Polishing Tool6.7.1 Calibrate and record polish downforce, alignmenttolerances, velocity, fluid dispense rates and otheroperational parameters based on recommendedprocedures from the equipment manufacturer.6.7.2 Polish the samples. 7 Measurement Locations on the Wafer7.1 The number and location of measurement sites arespecific to the process test. In general, locations shouldbe evenly spaced. Data extrapolation beyond theboundary of the measurement site population shouldnot be performed.7.2 ASTM F 1618 covers a set of site distributionpatterns for measuring the uniformity of a thin film on asilicon wafer, similar to Figures 2  5, as well as simpleprocedures for analyzing and reporting the results ofthose measurements. For edge-scan measurements, see Section 7.3.6 below. For spiral-scan measurements, seeSection 7.3.7 below. For full-wafer, high-densitymeasurements, see Section 7.3.10 below.7.3 Select one of these patterns for CMP processanalysis on unpatterned wafers, unless otherwise agreedto.7.3.1 Sampling plans are based on concentric circles,spirals, Cartesian sites, partial-radius, and partial andsingle-diameter sites.7.3.2 Measurements are made at the sites specified inthe chosen sampling plan, using the appropriateinstrumentation and measurement procedure for thefilm parameter of interest.7.3.3 Measures of the dispersion of the values areobtained by simple statistics specified for the samplingplans.7.3.4 For diagonal scan measurements, refer to Figure1. Select values for each of the following scanparameters: Scan Angle, Scan Radius Start/Stop, r 1 / r 2 Number of Measurement Points, n, across thediameter.7.3.5 For edge scan measurements, refer to Figure 6.Select values for each of the following scan parameters: Scan Angle, Inner Scan Radius, r 1 Outer Scan Radius, r 2 Number of Measurement Points, n, between r 1 andr 2.NOTE 4: These n measurement sites are uniformlydistributed.7.3.5.1 Discussion  the data density for edge scanmeasurements is generally higher than for othermeasurements. Combining a low-density diameterscan in the central region of the wafer with a higher-density edge scan, taken along the same scan line, canimprove throughput with appropriate localmeasurement data density.7.3.6 For spiral scan measurements, refer to Figure 7.In such scans, the measurements are evenly distributedfrom near the center (r = 0) to near the edge exclusionboundary (r = 1  EE). For each successive point, boththe radius and the angle are systematically changed.For the 200 mm example with 3 mm edge exclusionshown in Figure 7, the 81 measurement points start at

&lt;!-- Page 45 --&gt;

SEMI M48-1101 © SEMI 20015 R1 = 0.10 mm and1 = 0.52. Successive points areincremented with R = 1.21 mm and  = 1.16.NOTE 5: Spiral scans uniformly sample properties that areradially symmetrical. These scans apply equal weight to allmeasurement sites. They also provide radial information,similar to diameter scans, as well as additional theta-relatedinformation that may not be provided by diameter scans.7.3.7 For concentric circle scans, refer to Figures 2 and3. In these scans, the inner circles lie on a fraction ofthe nominal radius. For notched wafers, the outer circlelies on a radius equal to the nominal radius less theedge exclusion, which is conformal with the notch onnotched wafers. For flatted wafers the outer circle lieson a radius equal to the nominal radius less the sum ofthe flat depth plus the edge exclusion. 7.3.8 For Cartesian measurement scans, refer to Figure4.7.3.9 For full-wafer measurements, the measurementssites are evenly spaced over the entire area beingexamined. Typically, the first point is the wafer center,and the remaining measurement sites are equally spacedabout the wafer center in X and Y. This X-Y grid issimilar to Figure 4, but with significantly higher spatialdensity.7.4 Record and identify the measurement site locationsin accordance with SEMI M20.7.4.1 Include an illustration of these locations with thetest setup and with the recorded data set.
