SEMI T13-1104 © SEMI 200411 has not mounted any other Circuit Modules yet or it ison the way of fabrication.9.5.3.1 Mother Substrate Class Definition  MotherSubstrate inherits Circuit Module. Class definition ofthe Mother Substrate is completely same as one forCircuit Module. This class is redefined to separate classDie from the other Circuit Module classes forconvenience.9.5.4 Wafer  This is a type of Mother Substrateswhich represents thin disc shape semiconductormaterial to fabricate semiconductor devices on it.Examples are 300 mm diameter silicon wafers and 3inches diameter gallium arsenide wafers. Some case afew hundreds of microprocessor dice may be fabricatedon it.9.5.5 Glass Plate  This is a type of Mother Substratswhich represents thin transparent rectangular glass plateto fabricate flat panel display devices on it. However itis usually rectangle, sometimes it may be such othershape as circle. Some case length of one of ridge isbeyond one meter.9.5.6 Dicing Frame  This is a type of MotherSubstrates which represents thin rectangular flamewhich centers a piece of elastic sticky film to keep awafer for dicing. Dicing frame is usually reusable.9.5.7 Cassette  This is a type of Mother Substrateswhich represents one of reusable container to store andcarry Circuit Modules. Contained Circuit Modules arepositioned. Examples are wafer carriers, wafer shippingboxes, dicing frame magazines and IC trays.9.5.8 Tray  This is a type of Mother Substrateswhich represents a kind of cassettes which holds diceon two dimensional surface of it. It is often used tomove dice to next process, ship or test.9.5.9 Lead Frame  This is a type of MotherSubstrates which represents base of a die to package asa semiconductor device. It has many electrodes toconnect with electrode pads of the die. A few LeadFrames are often physically linked together beforepackaging is completed for convenience of production. In this sense Lead Frames are a kind of Strip describedlater.9.5.10 Tape  This is a type of Mother Substrateswhich represents very long narrow strip flexiblesubstrate made of plastic film, cloth, paper or hybridmaterial to hold electronics elements or small parts forcarrying, feeding or shipping. Usually it is rolled on amagazine for handling.9.5.11 PCB  Print Circuit Board. Hard or flexiblesubstrate with one or multiple layered circuit wiringconductor patterns an active/passive electronicselements on one of or both surfaces. This is also a typeof Mother Substrates.9.5.12 Strip  Usually rectangular or tape shapedsubstrate to mount electronics parts. This is also a typeof Mother Substrates.9.5.13 Cabinet  An enclosure for electronics to keepfrom exposure of electrode and/or subcomponents,and/or to give some means of human operation. Often itcontains PCBs and power supply module with switchesand such display devices as light emission diodes andflat display panel on it. This is also a type of MotherSubstrates. 10 Detail Concepts10.1 System Wide Concept  Previous sectiondescribes basic concepts of Die Tracing. Based onthese, this section describes more detailed concepts totrace dice practically.10.2 Die Trace System  A system for die tracingranges over any entity related to Die Trace Data of thetarget Die. From the system point view, there must besome managing objects to coordinate ensembles in thesystem to achieve expected responsibility.10.3 Die Trace System Linkage  Also it is difficult tomanage a lot of objects and data by just one manager. Itis expected to have more than one manager tocoordinate and manage data and such objects asMachines and Tracers. They link together to organize akind of network as illustrated in the following figure.

If something takes time to collect, it repliesimmediate data as much as it has and reports later whenthe data is available.10.5.2.2.2 planDTD  This optional service providesa capability to set which data are required to beacquired. If anticipated data cannot be acquired becausesuch data may not be supplied on specific equipment, itdoesnt accept this request. It may take time if it needsto ask process machines whether it has the capability toprovide specified data. Die Tracer replies informationthat the service request is acknowledged but detailpossibility is notified later in such cases. This is anoptional service and the means how to specify specific data item is out of scope of this document because it isdependent to equipment. If reported data are fixed byimplementation, this service has no effect at all.10.5.2.2.3 showDTD  This service replies requestedDie Trace Data. Tracer may ask requested data to itsdata source before it replies when enough data is notthere. If requested data is not on the tracer and it isdifficult to acquire, it replies no data. If the data item isstrange for the Tracer, it may ask peer Traceracquainted or DieTraceManager.10.5.2.2.4 setForward  This optional serviceforwards a part of or all Die Trace Data to specific URI.Forwarding data should be selectable by category, datatype or originating machine. Also whether theforwarded data is left on the object or removed shouldbe selectable. This service is optional and typically usedfor specific application or at the time data buffer isalmost full.

Also Die Trace Managermay participate a network of Die Trace Managers formore information exchange of Die Trace Data. Whensome information or inquiry comes, it may forward it tothe other network members. DieTraceManager admitresigndevolvelogExeption Figure 13Die Trace Manager Class 10.5.3.2 Services of Die Trace Manager  Die TraceManager provides the following services to complete itsresponsibility.10.5.3.2.1 admit  This service accepts a Die TraceManager to be a member of its network for Die TraceManagers. In the network Die Trace Data are sharedeven if they may be stored on different hardwareentities or different network segments. When someinquiry comes to one of the member of the network, itbroadcasts the inquiry to the other members if it has nocorresponding data locally or there must be further datain the network. A member of the network who knowsthe data replies to the inquirer. If the data is private forits owner, no reply may be given or notice withnegative reason may be responded. Some member maybe located outside of intranet. Network security andauthentication/authorization are outside of the scope ofthis document, and final users of this standard ornetwork solution providers shall take care this issue toprevent serious problems.10.5.3.2.2 resign  This service accepts a member DieTrace Manager to resign from Die Trace Managersnetwork. If requested Die Trace Manager has not been amember, this service replies just error information.10.5.3.2.3 devolve  This optional service accepts allor a part of Die Tracers transferred from a Die TraceManager as subordinates of this Die Trace Manager.This manager ask a service of each devolved Tracer toenroll its subordinate. Before the enrollment has not been completed the Tracers may report Die Trace Datato previous Manager. The manager is recommended toforward the data to the new Manager.10.5.3.2.4 logExeption  This optional service logsspecified message for errors, peculiar events and otherexceptions happened on each Die Tracer. The loggedinformation shall be kept for some fair period and/ordisplayed on the console of the computer or its remoteterminal window. This service is typically used forresource-less Die Tracers or concentrated exceptionmonitoring.10.5.3.3 Behavior of Die Trace Manager  Behavioris defined to complete responsibility of the Die TraceManager. The behavior is often specified throughcollaboration with its outside and state model.Collaboration is reflected on some association of thisclass with others. The collaboration may happen whensome service on this class is requested if the serviceneeds some related service on any associating class tocomplete the original service.

However specificproduction systems may be somewhat differentdepending on stages, the following models illustratetypical issues in interrelation between production andtracking.11.2 Data around Machine and Circuit Module There are many acquired or measured data and contextinformation of such production systems asManufacturing Execution System (MES) and Work InProcess (WIP). Each data or information could beindependent or a part of Die Trace Data.11.2.1 Obtained Data  Many sorts of data can beobtained on each piece of equipment. A part of the dataor the summarized/processed data could be Die TraceData.11.2.1.1 Examined Data  If Die Trace Machine ismetrology, inspection or test equipment, measured,inspected or tested result data is obtained on theequipment respectively. Such data as a whole, a part ofthe data or even the data which issummarized/processed, it could be a kind of Die TraceData. As long as the equipment has one or moremodules which have such functions, the equipment canprovide the data even if it has process capability.

SEMI T13-1104 © SEMI 2004 16 11.2.1.2 Acquired Data  During processing materialson equipment, it may acquire such data as values onsensors and set points on actuators/controllers. Some ofthe data could be sample values to deduce whether theprocess is done as expected or not. Acquired data whileit is idle, preparation or diagnosis may suggestequipment healthy state. Process logs are the otherexamples which record detail actions that suchinstructive prescription as process recipe doesntdescribe. In these senses this kind of data could be akind of Die Trace Data. Identification ofmounted/placed device may be one of examples of thisdata.11.2.1.3 Adjusted Parameters  Process recipes arefixed process prescriptions to instruct or guide howprocess is done. To avoid increasing number of recipesdramatically, adjustable parameters to allow someflexibility for each recipe is often used.Dispatching/scheduling function of ManufacturingExecution System (MES) or Advanced Process Control(APC) system often assigns their values. These valuesmay help inferring how process was turned out.11.2.2 Context Data  Meaningful data has itsproperty which makes sure where it was obtained, whenit was, which phase or step of a course of procedure,how it links with the other data or entities, and so on.Without the property data itself doesnt make senseeven if it is so accurate or high resolution. Context datamust be a part of Die Trace Data.11.3 Die Trace Data to get New Data  To get DieTrace Data on an equipment for certain process, DieTrace Data for previous process may be required. Forexample, for devices on a tray to be mounted on leadframes or PCBs, it is difficult to get interrelationbetween devices and base substrates if identificationcodes for the devices are unknown while the substratesidentifications are managed. On some limited processesand production lines MES provides a part of Die TraceData of previous process to equipment. For example,wafer ID information for a carrier is given for 300 mmprocess equipment. Good die information on a dicingframe is given to die bonding machine because themachine may not be aware of good dice to mount ontolead frames or dice may not tell for inkless systems.However, the information may not be given if dice areprovided on such a strip as tray or tape because onlygood dice are mounted on the strip. Die Tracing systemmay need to provide such data.11.3.1 Quasi Object for Data Transfer  To fix aboveproblem it should be clarified that Die Trace Machinemay need to get a part of Die Trace Data on previousprocess and Die Tracer may be asked for such data bythe machine. To make sure the nature on Die Tracingsystem, it solves the problem for the system to assume some class object having the nature. Die Trace Staffclass on Figure 16 has the role.11.3.1.1 Die Trace Staff Quasi Class  This class hasthe responsibility to ask some Die Trace Data to DieTracer if the data is required for tracking. Because it isinherited to Die Trace Machine and Die Tracer, theMachine may ask a part of Die Trace Data to the Tracerand the Tracer can ask the data to the other Die Tracerif the Tracer doesnt have the previous data. This isunofficial class so that this document may not givespecific definition. However, the capabilities defined inthe other classes provide the its capability. collects1..\* 1..\* requests Die TraceManager (DTM) Die Tracer(Tracer)1..\* managesDie Trace Machine(Machine) Die Trace Client(Client) 0..\* Die Trace Staff(Staff)inquiresinvestigation reports Figure 16Die Trace Staff Quasi Class12 Services for Device Tracking12.1 Services  This section defines content of servicemessages provided by classes in this document.12.1.1 Format and Protocol  The message formatand communication protocol may not be defined herebecause they are dependent to specific implementation.12.1.2 Public Interface  Each service definition is apart of definition of public interface.

SEMI T13-1104 © SEMI 2004 24 APPENDIX 1APPENDIX Device Tracking NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI T13 and was approved by full letter ballotprocedures on April 30, 2004. A1-1 Device TrackingA1-1.1 Die Tracking vs. Device TrackingA1-1.1.1 Growing modern semiconductor technology allows more than one die in a package. Such packagetechnologies as Flip Chip Packaging and System In Package (SIP) are examples. Sometimes more than five dice arepackaged in a small plastic package. Because the word device is the final product of semiconductor, trackingdevices can be covered by tracking die specification.A1-1.2 Device Tracking Data  Devices are moved from one substrate to another. The dimensions of thesubstrates are not the same so inevitably there will not be a one-to-one relationship between the From substrateand the To substrate. The simplest solution would be to send a set of reports each of which include the Fromsubstrate type, ID and XY devices coordinates and the same type of information again for the To substrate. Thiswill, however, lead to a lot of repetition of substrate type and ID.A1-1.2.1 Tracking Report  In order to keep it compact, the report will contain an ordered array of elements foreach device on the To substrate. The From substrate type and Id are only provided when substrate changes.The array may be row major or column major to match the processing sequence used on equipment, otherwise theFrom substrate type and Id might change back and forth.A1-1.2.2 Device Tracking Example  An example of Device Tracking is provided in Related Information.A1-1.3 Device ID Data  Devices may be marked either while they are still on the wafer (ref: Backside WaferIdTF) or when they are packaged on a strip, or in a tray.A1-1.3.1 Device ID Reporting Example  An example of Device ID Reporting is provided in RelatedInformation..A1-1.4 Substrate Layout Data  Device Tracking Data and Device ID Data depend on the devices to which theyrefer being arranged in a regular two dimensional array or matrix. I some cases, for example a multi-chip module,this is not the case. The Substrate Layout Data contains a representation of the substrate geometry in terms ofrepeating and nested matrices. Each matrix works as an identifier which links those elements to the correspondingDevice Tracking Data and Device ID Data.A1-1.4.1 Substrate Layout Data Example  example of Substrate Layout Data Reporting is provided in RelatedInformation.

SEMI T13-1104 © SEMI 200425 APPENDIX 2COORDINATE SYSTEMS NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI T13 and was approved by full letter ballotprocedures on April 30, 2004. A2-1 Horizontal CoordinatesA2-1.1 Die Coordinate, Origin and Fiducial  Definition of the origin of coordinates used with this specificationis basically compliant to such SEMI standard as G81 and G84. For complicated or irregular die arrangementincluding sub-array of dice, it is assumed to be compliant to Section 18 Coordinate System in SEMI E130. If theother coordinate system or origin definitions, which are specific to substrates or user/equipment dependent, user orsupplier shall specify in specification or complementary document. Fiducial information shall be also documented ifit is necessary for tracking.A2-1.2 The other Coordinate Systems  If surface position is required to give Die Trace Data except Devicecoordinates, such SEMI standard as M17, M20 or M21 shall be basically used: e.g. for visual inspection and filmthickness measurement. If some derivations from the standards or complete different coordinate system are required,depending on equipment, supplier or user shall document to exchange specification. A2-2 Vertical DimensionA2-2.1 Vertical Position  Sometimes vertical position may be required to represent Die Trace Data. This standardassumes one of the following representation of vertical position.A2-2.1.1 Z Dimension  This representation consists of Order and Height. Order means order number ofconcerning device from lowest substrate. Height is actual vertical dimension of concerning device from top surfaceof the device just below it or substrate. Unit of the Height is given with the value or common with the otherinformation. See R1-3 for example.A2-2.1.2 GCD Grid  When above positioning system is not convenient or doesnt work for specific equipment ortracking system, this system is used alternatively. Take Greatest Common Denominator (GCD) of all mounteddevices on substrate and assume a grid of the GCD. It may be 50 micron for example. The origin of the grid must besurface of base substrate and minus vale may be used in such a case that a die is implanted in the substrate. This maybe useful for some advanced assembly or bird-eye view preferred systems.A2-2.2 The Other Vertical dimensions  Additional vertical dimension may be required for some equipment.Because they are equipment dependent, this document doesnt specify anything about coordinates except theprevious subsections. User or suppliers shall document to understand Die Trace Data correctly.

This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot on April 30,2004. R2-1 Message Encapsulation in EnvelopesR2-1.1 Message Envelope  Communicating messages for Die Trace Data in this document with eXtensibleMarkup Language (XML) is one of effective choice. Such XML communication protocols as Simple Object AccessProtocol (SOAP) and XML-RPC (Remote Procedure Call) are very popular in this industry. In such protocols,messages are structured and encapsulated in such lower level protocol as Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Theencapsulation is referred to as Envelope. Actual message header and body are filled in the envelop. This relatedinformation introduces some example of the envelopes in the following sections. R2-2 Placing Message Name in Header with Message Parameters in BodyR2-2.1 Regular SOAP or XML-RPC Messaging  If message has no possibility to have binary value as itsparameter, regular XML messaging is often used. It is typical to have message name in header and parameters inbody as shown in the following list.R2-2.1.1 SEMI E128 Style Data Report  The following list shows an example of regular XML messagingenvelope in accordance with SEMI E128 Specification for XML Message Structure for the service takeDTD ofDie Tracer.

SEMI T13-1104 © SEMI 200433 RELATED INFORMATION 3AN EXAMPLE OF TRANSACTIONS HAPPENS IN DIE TRACINGSYSTEM NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI T13 and was derived from the JapaneseTraceability Committee. This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot on April 30,2004. R3-1 An Example of Transactions for Device TrackingR3-1.1 The following sequence diagram shows typical transaction in Die/Device Tracking System. This diagramillustrate an application how tracking runs and an example how this specification is applied.R3-1.2 Characters in the Example  This example has a couple of die tracing system islands. Each of them issupervised by independent Die Trace Manager: Mf and Mn. They may be separated areas in a frontend fab, frontendand backend fabs, or semiconductor fab and SMT fab. Each island has three Die Tracers including the Manager.Each Tracer has a couple of Die Trace Machines which can provide traceability functions and they must be doingeffective process for tracking. A Die Trace Client is located close to later process system: Cx.R3-1.3 Script  The example shows transactions related to a certain products. Transactions flow through thefollowing stages.R3-1.3.1 Usual Data Report  Each Machine report Die Trace Data for specific material for the product onindividual process.R3-1.3.2 Initial Inquiry  The client needs to look for suspicious process to screen possible devices which mayhave problem. It asks certain Die Trace Data to find the evidence of the problem to its one of familiar Tracers.R3-1.3.3 Secondary Inquiry  The first Tracer Tk doesnt have the data, so it asks its familiar Tracer or itsManager. Unfortunately the Manager Mn/Ti doesnt have that, so it asks to its subordinate Tracers: this case Tj only.R3-1.3.4 Extended Inquiry  Because no subordinates have the data, there is nothing for the Manager but toinquire the other Managers on tracking network. Inquired Manager Mf/Tc looks for to itself and asks its subordinateTracers.R3-1.3.5 Replying Back  Fortunately one of the Tracers has the data and it responds to the Manager. TheManager transfers to the other Manager as the response. The Client ended up with expected data.R3-1.3.6 Flushed Inquiry  Above inquiries may be flushed at one time rather than step by step inquiry.

This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot on April 30,2004. R4-1 Use Case DiagramR4-1.1 Use Case diagram is one of well-known means for understanding and analysis of problem domain to startwith. It is often used before modeling a system or bringing a good solution.R4-1.2 Use Case diagram consists of Actors and Use Cases. A use case defines something expected to a systemrelated to an actor or between actors. All use cases build up whole system. R4-2 Use Case Diagram of Device TrackingR4-2.1 The following diagram shows use case for Device Tracking.R4-2.2 Trace  Consumer asks listing all or a part of stages of Production History and Information for tracking.Examples may be picking up five latest history items or histories for changing substrates. Product Information mayinclude original production country, test house identification, assembly subcontractor and so on.R4-2.3 Back Track  Consumer traces Production History from the latest one and checks also Problem Histories ofthe state. If no specific essential problems is not found on the stage, information for previous stage is providedinteractively. If something is unclear, further information or data is requested to Producer.R4-2.4 Update History  Producer append / updates Production History describing what has done on the productincluding changing location or substrate. Information attached to the history may be dependent to the stage,equipment and/or product. Producer may also append / update Problem History describing briefly what the problemwas and how it was fixed.R4-2.5 Check History  Consumer asks detail history of a stage. System replies all or expected categories ofProduction History and Information. Because sometimes Consumer's curiosity may beyond what system knows, thesystem may ask further information to responsible producer in such case.R4-2.6 Notify  Consumer notifies phenomena on a product to system when some problem happens on theproduct. The system looks for resemble phenomena registered on the system. If it identified, the system let theconsumer know all information about the phenomena and update registry. Otherwise the system registers thephenomena and asks all producers or most possible ones to fix it. When a responsible producer responds about theproblem, the system update registry and let the consumer know.R4-2.7 Alert  Producer issues potential problems for a product. This information is registered on system anddistributed to all possible consumers. This capability can be used even if the product is still in process on somestage.

SEMI T13.2-1104 © SEMI 20041 SEMI T13.2-1104SPECIFICATION FOR XML PROTOCOL FOR DEVICE TRACKING This specification was technically approved by the Global Traceability Committee and is the directresponsibility of the Japanese Traceability Committee. Current edition approved by the Japanese RegionalStandards Committee on July 23, 2004. Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to be publishedNovember 2004. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this document is to map Servicesand data in SEMI T13 into XML protocol. 2 Scope2.1 This document is applied to XML implementationof Jigs and Implements traceability with someinteroperability with Surface Mount Technology (SMT)equipment.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This protocol mapping has a consideration beinginteroperable with SMT manufacturing it may be usedin such area, using this specification on suchmanufacturing area is not guaranteed because thisspecification is originally planned to be working onsemiconductor manufacturing systems includingequipment. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI T12  Specification for Tracing Jigs andImplementsSEMI T13  Specification of Device Tracking:Concepts, Behavior and Services4.2 Association Connecting Electronics Industries(IPC)/National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative(NEMI)/American National Standard institute (ANSI)1 IPC-2501  Definition for Web-Based Exchange ofXML data; (July, 2003)IPC-2541  Generic Requirements for ElectronicsManufacturing Shop-Floor Equipment Communication 1 http://www.ipc.org, http://www.nemi.org, http://www.ansi.org, Theoriginal developer is IPC with NEMI cooperation, ANSI ends up withauthorizing approval.

Some equipment users produce not onlysemiconductor devices but also Print Circuit Boards(PCBs). It is convenient for such users to have commonmessaging protocol with standard messaging forSurface Mount Technology (SMT). For this purposethis protocol mapping extension standard specifies themessaging mechanism conformant to IPC-2501Definition for Web-Based Exchange of XML Data as 2 World Wide Web Consortium, 32 Vassar St. Room 32-G515,Cambridg, MA 02139, USA Telephone: 617.253.2613; Fax:617.258.5999, http://www.w3c.org,3 http://www.ietf.org, IETF Secretariat c/o Corporation for NationalResearch Initiatives, 1895 Preston White Drive, Suite 100, Reston,VA 20191-5434, USA, Telephone +1 703 620 8990, Fax +1 703 6209071

Also this extension standarddocument follows IPC-2541 Generic Requirements forElectronics Manufacturing Shop-Floor EquipmentCommunication Messages and IPC-2551 SectionalRequirements for Manufacturing Execution Systemfor that reason. The following subsections describe apart of these specifications for introduction. Refer tothese documents for detail reference.6.2 SOAP Structure  A HTTP message in thisspecification has an envelope to contain a couple ofMIME blocks. One is for SOAP Envelope and the otheris for message detail to be able to mix with such non-XML information as binary data. The service messagespecified in SEMI T12 is contained in latter one. SOAPstandard envelope MIME Block contains SOAP Headerwhich has message information and SOAP Body whichcontains SOAP Faults. Outlined diagram is shown inRelated Information. Official definitions are given inreferenced documents.6.3 Messaging Mechanism  Message Broker, that islogical middle ware server to handle and relaymessages, is assumed somewhere on communicationnetwork. While the broker behaves as communicationserver, the other logical nodes are message clients.Every message starts with a client and responded by theserver. Messages communicated between clients areexchanged through the server. The server keeps postedmessages from clients in a queue for each individualclient. Expecting recipient client asks the server formessages and a topmost message in the queue for theclient is responded if the queue is not empty. Therecipient client posts acknowledge back to the server.When the recipient replies back a message to theoriginal sender client, same thing happens withswitched roles between sender and recipient clients.Explanatory diagrams for this outline are shown inRelated Information. Official specification is given inreferenced documents.6.4 Issues Specific to this Messaging  A few issuesfor IPC based communication protocol for Jigs andImplements Tracking are introduced here. 6.4.1 Domain Configuration  Message Broker hasdomain configuration information to make sure allacting entities, possible messages with relatedpublisher, recipient and subscriber clients. Also it hasother detail characteristics of the domain ofcommunication. Every client needs to look up theinformation before the first messaging.6.4.2 Message Information  This is an elementcontained in SOAP Header. This information providestime of transaction, sender, destination, messageidentification and schema type used for service messagedetail in the second MIME block.6.4.3 Attributes in Service Message Element  Thetop element of each service message has date/time ofthe message, session ID or session reference, request IDor request reference, and optional values. Some of theoptional values are extended for Jigs and ImplementsTracking communication: linkId, linkCnt and linkExp.The extension may be used for delayed reply messageand multiple divided replies to keep conformance ofrelated messages. 7 Requirements7.1 Service Mapping  Services defined in SEMI T12are mapped on the following table.7.1.1 Capitalized Service Message Element Name Base Each service message is mapped into an XMLelement with capitalized heading letter to preventcollision with XML or XML Schema native words.7.1.2 Service Message Element Name Suffix Because of symmetry of message brokercommunication and for XML element namingconvention, suffix of Request or Response is addedto each service message element name for request orresponse respectively: e.g. AddEventRequest to requestservice and AddEventResponse for its responsemessage.
