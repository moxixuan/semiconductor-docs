SEMI M38-1104
SPECIFICATION FOR POLISHED RECLAIMED SILICON WAFERS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Silicon  Wafer  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Silicon  Wafer  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  August  16,  2004.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>
September  2004;  to  be  published  November  2004.  Originally  published  September  1999;  previously
published November 2001.
NOTICE:  This  document  was  completely  rewritten  in</p><h1>2004</h1><ol start="2004"><li>1  Purpose</li><li>1 Silicon   wafers   are   often   subjected   to   reclaim
processes in order to improve manufacturing efficiency
in device production.  A reclaimed wafer is one that has
been re-conditioned for subsequent utilization.</li><li>2 This     specification     covers     requirements     for
reclaimed  silicon  wafers  to  be  used  for  testing  and
process monitoring in semiconductor manufacturing.</li><li>3 In some instances for 300 mm wafers with supplier
marked  back  surfaces,  it  is  necessary  to  re-inscribe  the
mark  after  one  or  more  reclaim  cycles.    Consequently,
this specification also includes an appendix that covers
the re-inscription of such wafers.
NOTE 1:  Issues related to the re-inscription of such 300 mm
wafers are discussed in Related Information 1.
2  Scope</li><li>1 This  specification  divides  reclaimed  wafers  into
four    application    categories:    Mechanical,    Furnace,
Particle,  and  Lithography  and  provides  tables  of  the
specification  requirements  for  each  category.    Thus,  a
prospective purchaser of reclaimed silicon wafers needs
to   know   which   application   matches   his   or   her
requirements.</li><li>2 Only requirements for some attributes are specified
in Tables 1 and 2.  Other requirements are indicated to
be “customer specified” which means that the customer
may  specify  a  requirement  for  that  particular  attribute,
“as-supplied”   which   means   that   the   attribute   has
whatever value was supplied in the wafer delivered (or
used)  for  reclaim,  and  “unspecified”  which  means  that
the  attribute  is  not  specified  and  for  which  the  wafer
does not need to be tested.</li><li>3 In   addition   to   the   general   categories   listed   in
Section 2.1, this specification provides requirements for
reclaimed  wafers  intended  for  use  in  advanced  device
production,  including  devices  in  the  180  and  130  nm
technology generations in a third table.</li><li>4 This  specification  is  directed  specifically  to  silicon
wafers with one or both polished surfaces.  If the wafers
have  epitaxial  deposits,  the  attributes  of  the  epitaxial
layer are not included the specification requirements.</li><li>5 This  specification  covers  reclaim  wafers  that  are
either  customer-supplied  or  third  party-sourced.    The
user  should  exercise  caution  when  sourcing  materials
with    unknown    thermal    histories,    unknown    bulk
contamination, or unknown deposits, such as gold (Au)
films.</li><li>6 For  applications  placing  higher  demands  on  silicon
wafers  such  as  particle  counting,  measuring  pattern
resolution in a photolithography process, or surface ion
contamination  monitoring,  the  customer  may  want  to
reference SEMI M1, SEMI M8, or SEMI M24.</li><li>7 For referee purposes, U.S. customary units shall be
used  for  wafers  of  2-  and  3-inch  nominal  diameter  and
SI   (System   International),   commonly   called   metric,
units for 100 mm and larger diameter wafers.
NOTICE: This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

requirements.    In  this  context,  “capable  of  meeting”
shall signify that the supplier is not required to perform
the  appropriate  tests  in  Section  9.    However,  if  the
purchaser  performs  the  test  and  the  material  fails  to
meet  the  requirement,  the  material  may  be  subject  to
rejection.
9  Packing and Marking
9. 1 Special  packing  requirements  shall  be  subject  to
agreement between the supplier and the purchaser.
Otherwise  all  wafers  shall  be  handled,  inspected,  and
packed   in   such   a   manner   as   to   avoid   chipping,
scratches,  and  contamination,  and  in  accordance  with
the best industry practices, to provide ample protection
against damage during shipment.
9. 2 The  wafers  supplied  under  this  specification  shall
be  identified  by  appropriately  labeling  the  outside  of
each   box   or   other   container   and   each   subdivision
thereof in which it may reasonably be expected that the

APPENDIX 1
SPECIFICATION FOR MULTIPLE LASER MARKING (RE-INSCRIPTION)
OF 300 mm POLISHED SILICON RECLAIMED WAFERS
NOTICE:  The  material  in  this  appendix  is  an  official  part  of  SEMI  M38  and  was  approved  by  full  letter  ballot
procedures on August 16, 2004.
A1-1  Purpose
A1-1.1  Silicon  wafers  are  often  subjected  to  reclaim
processes, in order to improve manufacturing efficiency
in   device   production.      This   process   can   remove
significant  material  from  the  marked  surface  of  a  300
mm  wafer.    This  can  lead  to  reduced  dot  diameter  for
marks  with  “v”-shaped  profile,  to  the  point  that  the
mark  no  longer  meets  the  requirements  of  SEMI  T7.
This can compromise the mark’s readability.
A1-1.2  This   specification   is   intended   to   identify
locations  on  the  back  surface  of  300  mm  reclaimed
silicon   wafers   for   re-inscribing   the   SEMI   T7   and
optionally  the  OCR  (according  to  SEMI  M1.15)  laser
marks  in  order  to  maintain  traceability  after  multiple
reclaims.
A1-2  Scope
A1-2.1  This      specification      defines      the      spatial
relationships for back surface marking of reclaimable or
reclaimed   notched,   double-side   polished   300   mm
wafers   of   silicon   with   pre-existing   manufacturers’
marks which comply with SEMI M1.15.
A1-2.2  Although this specification does not specify the
marking    equipment    or    techniques    that    may    be
employed  when  complying  with  its  requirements,  it  is
required that the symbols be a “hard mark” obtained by
laser scribing individual dots with diameter as specified
in SEMI T7.
NOTICE: This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

Double-Side Polished Wafers with a Two-Dimensional
Matrix Code Symbol
NOTICE: Unless  otherwise  indicated,  all  documents
cited shall be the latest published versions.
A1-4  Ordering Information
A1-4.1  For  300  mm  wafers  that  are  to  be  re-inscribed
the following shall be specified on the purchase order:
A1-4.1.1  Whether  the  previous  inscription  is  to  be
obliterated, and the method for such obliteration,
A1-4.1.2 Content of re-inscribed field
• Same as prior mark, or
• New field content
A1-5  Requirements
A1-5.1  Location of the Laser Inscription
A1-5.1.1  The  original  reference  point  shall  be  located
148. 95  mm  ±  0.15  mm  from  the  center  of  the  wafer
along a radius at 5.0° ± 0.1° counterclockwise from the
axis of the fiducial bisector.
A1-5.1.2
The    first    re-inscription    shall    be    placed
counterclockwise  to  the  original  mark  at  the  same
distance   from   the   wafer   center   on   a   radius   10°
counterclockwise from the original mark.
A1-5.1.3  Any subsequent re-inscription shall be placed
counterclockwise  to  the  previous  mark  at  the  same
distance   from   the   wafer   center   on   a   radius   10°
counterclockwise from the previous mark.
A1-5.1.4  Consequently,  the  most  recent  re-inscription
is    located    on    a    radius    an    angle
θ        degrees
counterclockwise  from  the  fiducial  bisector  as  follows

where
n = the total number of re-inscriptions.</li></ol><p>SEMI M38-1104 © SEMI 1999, 2004 11
A1-5.2  Maintaining Inscription Utility — The angle of the new inscription shall be provided to the customer by the
supplier so that the tool used to read the inscriptions can be adjusted to read the wafer ID at the new angle.  Since it
is possible for a tool to be provided the wrong angle to read an inscription, as long as the information remains the
same as the prior inscription, errors can be minimized (read attempts at different angles).</p><p>5° + n × 10°

RELATED INFORMATION 1
BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR MULTIPLE LASER MARKING (RE-
INSCRIPTION) OF 300 mm POLISHED SILICON RECLAIMED WAFERS
NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI M38.  It was developed by the International 300
mm Reclaim Remark Task Force during the development of the specification for multiple-laser marking of 300 mm
polished  silicon  reclaimed  wafers.    This  related  information  was  approved  for  publication  by  full  letter  ballot
procedures on August 16, 2004.
R1-1  Multiple Laser Making Issues
R1-1.1  Issues  related  to  multiple  laser  marking  of  300
mm silicon reclaimed wafers were explored at meetings
during SEMICON West in San Francisco in July 2002,
SEMICON   Southwest   in   Austin   in   October   2002,
SEMICON Japan in Tokyo in December 2002 and a ½
day  workshop  during  SEMICON  Europa  in  Munich  in
April  2003.    Significant  input  from  device  makers,
wafer    reclaimers,    and    equipment    suppliers    was
received.</p><p>R1-1.2  Four major issues emerged.
R1-2  When Is a Remark
Field Applied?
R1-2.1  This  could  be  at  each  reclaim  cycle,  or  when
the “first” mark is not readable at the reclaimer.
R1-2.2  Because  the  latter  is  a  difficult  matter,  it  was
decided to make this a decision of the purchaser.
R1-3    Where  Should  the  Remark  Field(s)  Be
Located?
R1-3.1  A device manufacturer suggested that each new
remark  field  be  located  10°  counter  clockwise  (CCW)
from the previous mark field, and at the same radius.
R1-3.2  A    wafer    with    two    of    more    fields    is
unambiguously  identified  as  a  reclaim  wafer  and  the
“n”  remarked  fields  it  contains  indicate  the  number  of
reclaim cycles it has experienced, if it is remarked after
each use.
R1-4  What Is the Remark Field’s Content?
R1-4.1  Two scenarios are possible:
R1-4.1.1  Different  from  the  Original  Mark  —  For
example,  retaining  the  ID  #  but  changing  the  supplier
code from original to the reclaim supplier’s code.  This
could   confuse   a   device   fab’s   database   when   two
identical  ID  numbers  appear  in  the  database  unless  it
also   includes   the   vendor   code.      Changing   the   ID
number does not necessarily avoid this problem.
R1-4.1.2  Same as the Original Mark — This simplifies
the remark coding.  However, the is still the possibility
of confusing the device manufacturer’s database.
R1-4.2  It  was  decided  to  make  this  a  decision  of  the
purchaser.
R1-5  How to “Disable” a Previous Mark Field?
R1-5.1  Disabling  a  mark  field  requires  that  a  mark
field  be  modified  or  obliterated  sufficiently  to  ensure
the reader reports a “no read.”
R1-5.2  It was decided to make both the requirement to
obliterate   the   previous   mark   and   the   method   of
obliteration decisions of the purchaser.
R1-6  Mark Field Obliteration Comments.
R1-6.1  Obliterating    an    entire    field    may    not    be
necessary  to  make  it  unreadable.    For  the  two  mark
fields  specified  in  SEMI  M1.15,  the  following  may
apply:
R1-6.1.1  Data Matrix Field
R1-6.1.1.1  Reliable  reading  of  this  field  requires  a
quiet  zone  (no  surface  disturbance)  about  four  dots
wide  (400  μm)  around  the  field  periphery.    Filling  the
quiet  zone  with  dots  insures  that  the  Data  Matrix  mark
cannot be read.
R1-6.1.1.1.1  Surrounding  the  8  row  ×  32  column  field
with  a  4-dot  border  involves  (8  +  32)  ×  2  ×  4  =  320
dots.
R1-6.1.1.1.2  A  3-dot  border  may  work  as  well,  and
requires 240 dots.
R1-6.1.1.2
Conversely,  overwriting  the  field  involves
8 × 32 = 306 dots.
R1-6.1.1.2.1  A difference of 100 μm (one dot) between
the  positions  of  the  overwrite  field  and  original  field
should still produce a “no read.”
R1-6.1.1.2.2  Some  position  difference  results  from  the
marker’s   wafer   alignment   system.      The   alignment
capability  of  deployed  300  mm  markers  is  therefore  a
consideration.
R1-6.2  Alphanumeric Field
R1-6.2.1  Obliterating  one  or  more  message  characters
and one or more check sum characters should make the
mark  unreadable  by  both  camera  and  human  readers.</p><p>SEMI M38-1104 © SEMI 1999, 2004 13
This  requires  completely  overwriting  each  of  these
characters with a filled 5 × 9 character field (45 dots at
“single density”).  It was suggested this be done at two
ID  characters  (1  and  6  in  the  12-character  string)  and
one check sum character (12).
R1-6.2.2  This overwriting involves 3 fields × 45 dots =
135 dots.
R1-6.2.3  The   alignment   comments   in   Section   R1-
6. 1.1.2.2  also apply to these fields.
R1-7    Use  of  Remarked  Reclaimed  Wafers  in
Device Fabrication
R1-7.1  This may involve two scenarios:
R1-7.1.1  Incoming Search
R1-7.1.2  Determine  the  “good”  remark  field  location
(5 + <!-- -->[10 × n]<!-- -->) degrees from the notch bisector for each
wafer and store that data in the factory database.  Then
the  manufacturing  execution  system  commands  a  tool
handling   that   wafer   to   go   to   the   appropriate   field
location.      This   minimizes   or   eliminates   throughput
effects.
NOTE 1:  This  requires  variable  read  location  capability  (by
wafer rotation, for instance) on the tool.
R1-7.2  Local Tool Search
R1-7.2.1  When  unable  to  read  the  original  field,  the
tool  scans  counterclockwise  until  it  finds  a  readable
field.  This cycle can adversely impact tool throughput.
NOTE 2:  This requires
• Variable read location capability and
• “Smart” read, i.e., 3 levels, as follows:
• Good read (this is the “right” field, so keep the
data),
• Bad  read  (this  is  an  obliterated  field,  go  to
“next” location and try again), and
• No read (no mark is present, search somewhere
else).

TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY AND HALL
COEFFICIENT AND DETERMINING HALL MOBILITY IN SEMI-
INSULATING GaAs SINGLE CRYSTALS
This  test  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Compound  Semiconductor  Committee  and  is  the
direct responsibility of the Japanese Compound Semiconductor Committee. Current edition approved by the
Japanese Regional Standards Committee on June 1, 1999.  Initially available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> August 1999;
to be published September 1999.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  The purpose of this document  is to specify a meth-
od to measure resistivity and determine Hall mobility of
semi-insulating  GaAs  single  crystals  by  the  Van  der
Pauw  method.  Especially,  this  document  specifies  a
simple   and   practical   method   for   commercial   semi-
insulating GaAs single crystals.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This test method covers a proc edure for measuring
the  resistivity  and  determining  Hall  mobility  of  semi-
insulating  GaAs  single  crystals  by  the  van  der  Pauw
method.    This  method  requires  a  singly  connected  test
specimen  without  any  isolated  holes,  of  homogeneous
thickness  and  with  a  square  shape.    In  this  method,
contacts  must  be  sufficiently  small  and  located  at  the
corners of the specimen.</li><li>2   This  standard  may  involve  haz ardous  materials,
operation,  and  equipment.    This  standard  does  not
purport to address all of the safety problems associated
with  its  use.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  user  of  this
standard   to   establish   appropriate   safety   and   health
practices  and  determine  the  applicability  of  regulatory
limitations prior to use.

4  Terminology
NOTE 2:  Many of the terms associated with this test method
can be found in ASTM Definitions F 76-86.
hall  mobility   the  ratio  of  the  magnitude  of  the  Hall
coefficient  to  the  resistivity;  it  is  readily  interpreted
only in a system with carriers of one charge type.
resistivity   the  ratio  of  the  potential  gradient  parallel
to the current in the material to the current density.  For
the  purpose  of  this  method,  the  resistivity  shall  always
be determined for the case of zero magnetic flux.
5  Summary of Test Method</li><li>1   In  this  method,  the  thickness  o f  a  specimen  cut
from a semi-insulating GaAs single crystal is measured.</li><li>2  Ohmic contacts are formed on  the specimen.</li><li>3  The temperature near the spec imen is measured.</li><li>4  Hall-effect measurement is per formed and data are
taken.</li><li>5   From  the  measured  data,  the  re sistivity  and  Hall
mobility are calculated and corrected for temperature.
6  Interferences</li><li>1    Light   could   cause   an   error   due    to   photo-
conductivity, so the specimen must be placed in a dark
environment.</li><li>2   Temperature  fluctuation  gives   significant  error.
Specimen itself could be at higher temperature than the
environment  if  one  does  not  take  sufficient  time  after
soldering the contacts.</li><li>3  The current-voltage conditions  must be ohmic.</li><li>4   The  damaged  layer  due  to  the   sawing  must  be
removed by etching the specimen, for example by using
mixture  of  sulfuric  acid  (H

GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS OF PLANAR
SURFACES ON SILICON WAFER
This guide was technically approved by the Global Silicon Wafer Committee and is the direct responsibility
of the North American Silicon Wafer Committee. Current edition approved by the North American Regional
Standards  Committee  on  December  15,  1999.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  February  2000;  to  be
published February 2000.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1   This  guide  provides  procedure s  for  specifying  the
measurements    to    be    used    in    characterizing    and
reporting  roughness  of  the  planar  surfaces  of  silicon
wafers.    It  may  also  be  applicable  to  other  types  of
planar wafer materials.</li><li>2   This  guide  provides  nomencla ture  and  procedures
for   roughness   determination   that   employ   three   key
methodologies:</li><li>2.1  Standardized scan site patterns ,</li><li>2.2  Roughness abbreviations, and</li><li>2.3   Reference  test  methodologies   with  respect  to
identifying specific roughness measurements.
2  Scope</li><li>1      This     guide     incorporates     the     fol lowing
methodologies:</li><li>1.1   Standardized  scan  patterns  for   both  local  and
full-area surface characterization,</li><li>1.2   A  set  of  roughness  abbreviatio ns  that  describe
measurement conditions in a short-hand code, and</li><li>1.3   Reference  test  methodologies   for  three  generic
types   of   roughness   measuring   instruments.      These
general categories may include, but are not limited to:
• Profilometers  —  AFM  and  other  scanning  probe
microscopes; optical profilometers; high-resolution
mechanical stylus systems,
• Interferometers — interference microscopes, and
• Scatterometers  —  Total  integrating  scatterometers
(TIS),  angle-resolved  light  scatterometers  (ARLS),
scanning surface inspection systems (SSIS).</li><li>2   Procedures  to  obtain  a  represe ntative  value  of
roughness for a surface are specified.</li><li>3   Roughness  nomenclature  is  int ended  to  remove
ambiguities  with  respect  to  identifying  the  roughness
measurements used and the results achieved.</li><li>4   This  guide  does  not  purport  to   address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.      It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  guide  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  This guide does not apply to m easurements in the
edge region of wafers.</li><li>2  This guide does not apply to sp atial wavelengths &lt;
10 nm.</li><li>3    This   guide   is   not   intended   to   d efine   specific
roughness  parameters;  these  can  be  found  in  other
documents.</li><li>4   The  bandwidth  of  the  measure ment  tool  and  the
bandwidth  used  can  severely  influence  the  result  of
roughness measurements.</li><li>4.1   Differences  in  either  long  or  sh ort  bandwidths
used between two instruments can produce significantly
different results.</li><li>4.2   The  codes  listed  in  Table  1  of   this  guide  do  not
identify instrument transfer functions.</li><li>5   The  presence  of  films  may  affe ct  light  scattering
measurements.
4  Discussion</li><li>1   Roughness  of  silicon  wafer  su r faces  is  becoming
frequently specified for bare silicon wafers (cf. the SIA
International  Technology  Roadmap  for  Semiconduc-
tors).    These  specifications  refer  to  the  roughness  of
both the final polished front and the back surfaces of a
wafer.      Various   techniques   are   currently   used   to
measure the surface roughness of silicon wafers.  These
techniques  include  AFM  scanning  probes,  mechanical
and  optical  profiling,  interferometric  microscopes,  and
light (electromagnetic radiation) scattering.  Mechanical
profiling techniques are widely used in other industries
and  are  well  standardized.    Profiling  techniques  are
generally  limited  to  line  scans  and  therefore  provide
information  of  only  a  very  small  part  of  a  surface.
Interferometric techniques for roughness measurements
are     similarly     limited,     whereas     light     scattering
techniques can scan the entire wafer surface.</li></ol><p>SEMI M40-0200 © SEMI 20002
4. 2   Historically  a  variety  of  rough ness  parameters  for
profiling   techniques   have   evolved   and   have   been
standardized, including rms roughness (R
q
) and average
roughness   (R
a
).      Profiling   instruments   measure   the
surface topography and derive roughness statistics, such
as  R
q
,  from  a  series  of  height  data.    Light  scattering
techniques measure R
q
from the angular dependence of
scattering;  some  light  scattering  systems  derive  other
parameters through interpretation and estimation.
4. 3   A  roughness  value  representat ive  of  an  entire
wafer  surface,  or  a  large  portion  of  the  surface,  cannot
be  based  on  data  obtained  at  a  single  point.    Yet,
specifications often describe a single value for a wafer.
Therefore,    this    guideline    suggests    and    defines
standardized patterns of scan sites that can be described
and   used   unambiguously.   A   model   describing   the
relationship    between    several    types    of    roughness
variation, scan patterns, and reported results is included
in  the  attached  Related  Information  to  assist  users  in
specifying and interpreting these variables.
4. 4  A common feature of all rough ness measurements
is  their  dependence  on  the  bandwidth  and  transfer
function  of  the  tool  used.    In  addition,  high  or  low
spatial   frequency   software   filters   are   common   and
affect  reported  results.    Widely  different  numbers  can
be  reported  for  the  same  surface  by  two  measurement
instruments.    This  guideline  includes  suggestions  on
specifying  and  reporting  the  instrument  bandwidth  and
transfer function.

scattered  by  a  surface,  it  is  the  differential  radiance
normalized   by   the   differential   irradiance,   and   is
approximated by the scattered power per unit projected
solid angle divided by the incident power (Stover).
6. 5   fixed  quality  area  (FQA)  —  th e  central  area  of  a
wafer surface, defined by a nominal edge exclusion, X,
over  which  the  specified  values  of  a  parameter  apply
(SEMI  M1).    See  also  the  discussion  immediately
following this definition in SEMI M1.
6. 6   haze  —  non-localized  light  sca ttering  resulting
from   surface   topography   (microroughness)   or   from
dense    concentrations    of    surface    or    near-surface
imperfections (SEMI M1).
DISCUSSION   —   Haze   due   to   the   existence   of   a
collection  of  imperfections  is  a  mass  effect;  individual
imperfections of the type which result in haze cannot be
readily   distinguished   by   the   eye   or   other   optical
detection  systems  without  magnification.    In  a  particle
counter (SSIS), haze results in a background signal and
laser   light-scattering   events   together   comprise   the
signal  due  to  light-scattering  from  a  wafer  surface.
(SEMI   M1).      It   is   the   total   scattered   optical   flux</p><p>6 Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), 181 Metro Drive, Suite

collected   by   an   optical   system   normalized   by   the
incident flux.
NOTE   2:   Different   SSIS   instrument   types   may   give
significantly different haze values on a given sample.
6. 7   illumination  source  incidence   angle   the  angle
of the incoming beam, measured from surface normal.
6. 8  kurtosis (Rku) — a measure of  the sharpness of the
histogram of surface profile height deviations Z(x) from
the mean line within the evaluation length.  A complete
random surface will have a Gaussian histogram and Rku
= 3 (ASME B46.1).
6. 9   laser  light-scattering  event  —   a  signal  pulse  that
exceeds a preset threshold, generated by the interaction
of  a  laser  beam  with  a  discrete  scatterer  at  a  wafer
surface  as  sensed  by  a  detector;  see  also  haze  (SEMI
M1).  See also the discussion that follows this definition
in SEMI M1.
6. 10   lay  –  the  predominant  directio n  of  the  surface
pattern,    ordinarily    determined    by    the    production
method used (ASME B46.1).
6. 11       microroughness      —      surface      rou ghness
components with spacing between irregularities (spatial
wavelength) less than about 100 μm (SEMI M1).
6. 12     Nyquist    Criterion    —    the    shorte st    spatial
wavelength detected.  It is twice the sample spacing.
6. 13   one-dimensional  grating  equa tion  —  in  its  most
common   form,   it   is   an   expression   that   gives   the
positions  of  diffracted  orders  from  a  one-dimensional
sinusoidal grating (Stover).
6. 14  peak to valley (R
t
) — the highe st to lowest value
of  the  surface  profile  height  deviations  Z(x)  from  the
mean line taken within the evaluation Length L (ASME
B46.1).
6. 15    power   spectral   density   (PSD)    function   —   a
surface  characterization  function  that  is  proportional  to
the  square  of  the  modulus  of  the  Fourier  transform  of
the  surface  and  may  be  considered  as  a  roughness
power per unit of spatial frequency (ASTM F 1811).
6. 16   Rayleigh  Criterion  (of  resolvin g  power)  —  a
condition   for   distinguishing   a   pair   of   diffraction
patterns whereby the maximum of one pattern overlaps
with the minimum of the other.
DISCUSSION — When a lens is free from aberrations,
the   images   of   point   objects   appear   as   diffraction
patterns.    When  the  principle  maximum  of  one  pattern
strikes  the  first  minimum  of  another,  the  images  are
described  as  being  resolved.    With  respect  to  circular
optics,  this  criterion  applies  when  the  distance  between
resolvable point objects, viewed from the objective lens
of the instrument, is</p><p>SEMI M40-0200 © SEMI 20004

skewness (Rsk) — a measure o f the asymmetry of
the  surface  topographic  deviations  of  a  surface  Z(x,y)
about  the  mean  line.    A  perfect  random  surface  will

profile  valleys  from  the  mean  line  taken  within  the
evaluation length. (Adapted from ISO 4281/1.)
6. 26
transfer function — the respon se of an instrument
over all measured spatial wavelengths.
DISCUSSION  —  A  perfect  instrument  would  have  a
100%  response  over  all  spatial  wavelengths.  Every
measuring  instrument  will  have  some  deviation  from  a
perfect response especially at the low spatial frequency
limit  (the  traversing  length)  and  at  the  high  spatial
frequency  limit.    The  power  spectrum  can  be  used  to
examine   this   limit   near   the   high   spatial   frequency</p><p>8  Optics,  Eugene Hecht, et al;  3rd edition (August 1997);  Addison-

7  Instruments and Capabilit ies
7. 1  Profilometers
7. 1.1
The   high   spatial   frequency   lim it   of   AFM,
mechanical  and  optical  profilers  can  be  approximated
by  the  radius  of  the  mechanical  tip  or  by  the  diameter
and  intensity  profile  of  the  laser  spot,  respectively.
Their  response  functions  are  complicated,  and  in  some
cases  are  a  combined  effect  of  the  probe  and  the
measured  surface.  The  high  spatial  frequency  limit  of
such tools has to be set or selected reasonably removed
from   that   limit   in   order   to   achieve   reasonable,
comparable, and repeatable measurements.
7. 2
Interference Microscope
7. 2.1
The   high   spatial   frequency   lim it   of   these
instruments is defined by the focusing optics or in some
cases  by  the  pixel  spacing  of  the  detector  array.   The
high  spatial  frequency  limit  of  such  tools  has  to  be  set
or selected reasonably removed from that limit in order
to   achieve   reasonable,   comparable,   and   repeatable
measurements.
7. 3
Scattering Instruments
7. 3.1
A   straightforward   relation   betw een   scattered
light intensity and roughness exists only for sufficiently
smooth     surfaces.     The     Rayleigh     smooth-surface
criterion, given below, is frequently used for estimating
the smooth-surface limit (Stover).

7. 3.4
Light  scattering  tools  can  be  ap plied  to  rougher
surfaces  than  those  surfaces  identified  in  equations  1
and   2,   but   then   other   mathematical   approaches   as
compared to PSD curves have to be applied to calculate
roughness  or  slope  values.    Also,  the  slope  of  the  PSD
curve can be important in certain situations (Stover).
7. 3.5
There  is  a  basic  high  spatial  fr equency  (short
spatial wavelength) limit for light scattering tools which
cannot be exceeded.  This limit is:
a) twice the inverse wavelength,
λ
2
, of the light used in
case of grazing incidence (θ
i
= 90°), and
b)  one  inverse  wavelength,
λ

,  in  the  case  of  normal
incidence (θ

= 0°).

7. 4  Total Integrating Scatteromete rs (TIS)
7. 4.1
These  instruments  most  often   use  an  incidence
angle close to zero.  The low and high frequency limits
of  the  accessible  spatial  bandwidth  are  defined  by  the
design   of   the   optical   system.      An   appropriately
designed   system   may   be   able   to   access   a   spatial
bandwidth  from  about  0.8  μm  to  about  40  μm.    These
systems  may  also  be  designed  so  that  the  scattered
signal  can  be  broken  into  low  spatial  frequency  (near
specular)   and   high   spatial   frequency   (large   scatter
angle) bands.
7. 5
Angle-resolved Light Scatterom eters (ARLS)
7. 5.1
The high spatial frequency lim it of this technique
is  defined  by  incident  and  scattering  angles  and  the
illumination wavelength used.
7. 5.2
The low spatial frequency limi t is given by
•
the above equations (for incidence angle),
•
the diameter of the incident illumination spot at the
wafer surface,
•
the solid collection angle of the optical system, and
•
the   smallest   angular   distance   allowed   by   the
instrument between specular reflected light and the
detector.
7. 5.3
The  roughness  may  be  measur ed  by  using  a
fixed  incidence  angle  and  by  recording  the  intensity  of
scattered  light  at  various  scattering  angles  in  the  plane
of  incidence.    The  two-dimensional  PSD  curve  of  the
surface   can   then   be   calculated   from   the   angular
spectrum  of  the  scattered  light  (BRDF).    R
q
as  well  as
mq   may   be   calculated   from   a   one-dimensional   or
isotropic  PSD  curve  for  a  given  spatial  bandwidth  as
long as the above mentioned limits are accommodated.
7. 5.4
Such  tools  may  be  able  to  acce ss  a  spatial
bandwidth  range  of  about  one-half  the  wavelength  of
the illuminating light up to several hundred μm.
7. 6
Scanning Surface Inspection S ystems (SSIS)
7. 6.1
SSIS    measurements    are    integra ted    scatter
measurements similar to those made by TIS systems, in
that  they  gather  light  over  large  solid  angles;  however,
there are some significant differences.  In general, most
SSIS avoid light collection within five to ten degrees of
the  specular  beam,  because  in  this  region  the  scatter
tends  to  be  dominated  by  surface  roughness  scatter
(which becomes background noise) competing with the
signal  from  laser  light  scattering  events.    The  early
(older)  scanners  generally  had  one  detector  measuring
light  from  a  very  large  solid  angle  collector.    Later
systems  tend  to  use  several  smaller  collection  angles,
each    with    their    own    detector.        Whatever    the
arrangement,  each  collection  angle  can  be  defined  in
terms  of  its  spatial  frequency  band  pass  region,  and
each    detector    will    have    some    background    haze
component  (or  threshold)  that  is  caused  by  surface
roughness.  Thus, in the absence of laser light scattering
events,  measured  haze  may  be  converted  to  an  rms
roughness  for  the  defined  spatial  frequencies.    This
conversion    assumes    that    the    surface    meets    the
necessary   (smooth,   clean,   front   surface   reflective)
conditions required for roughness calculations, and that</p><p>SEMI M40-0200 © SEMI 20006
other  noise  sources,  such  as  background  electronic
noise and Rayleigh air scatter, are not issues.

R
q
and  R
a
are  generally  used  fo r  silicon  wafer
surfaces.    Other  roughness  measurement  parameters
may also prove useful.  This guideline does not suggest
which  parameters  to  use,  rather  it  suggests  how  to
incorporate    any    parameter    into    a    standardized
measurement specification.
8. 2
Measurement Sites
8. 2.1
Roughness can vary considera bly across a wafer
surface.    It  may  also  have  a  preferential  direction  or
anisotropy,  often  called  “lay”  (ASME  B46.1).    Many
measurement  techniques  are  limited  to  a  very  small
measurement  area  and  to  one  or  two  scan  directions.
Therefore   specific   measurement   patterns   must   be
defined   to   obtain   representative   and   reproducible
results.    These  patterns  should  correspond  to  effects
observed  on  wafers  in  different  manufacturing  steps.
These processing steps can generate features on a wafer
surface with rotational symmetries ranging from mirror
to infinite.  The wafer slicing process may produce low
symmetry,  while  single-wafer  polishing  can  produce
high symmetry.
8. 2.2
In  cases  where  only  a  small  nu mber  of  spots  is
measured, the spot pattern and the scan orientation have
to  be  identified.    See  Figure  1  for  some  patterns  and
orientations;   others   may   be   agreed   upon   between
interested parties.
8. 3
Site Patterns
8. 3.1
One-point  —  This  can  be  usef ul  for  rapidly
reviewing results of a quantity of wafers.  This is often
at the wafer centerpoint.
8. 3.2
In  applications  where  only  a  sm all  number  of
locations are to be measured, the pattern and orientation
of the local scans have to be identified.  Measurements
are performed at locations as outlined in Figure 1.  For
each    local    scan,    a    representative    roughness    is
calculated.    The  wafer’s  representative  roughness  is
then  a  function  of  the  n  individual  representative  scan
values.    The  roughness  variation  can  be  calculated  by
the average, the standard deviation, the maximum or the
range  (Max-Min)  of  the  individual  scan  values.    Other
statistical approaches may be employed.
8. 3.3
Standard patterns include:
a.
1-pointWafer center,
b.
5-pointWafer  Center  plus  four  points  at  2r/3
from the wafer center, and
c.
9-pointWafer  Center  plus  four  points  at  2r/5
and four at 4r/5 from the wafer center.
NOTE 4: These patterns have been shown to be useful with a
range of symmetries and values.  See Related Information.
8. 3.4     Standard    measurement    orienta tion    patterns
include:
a.
Type  A  -  linear  scans  parallel  and  perpendicular
to the fiducial bisector, and
b.
Type  B  -  linear  scans  at  45
o
relative  to  the
fiducial bisector.
NOTE  5:  Type  A  is  generally  used  for  all  surfaces.    Type  B
has been reported to be useful for some surface conditions on
(111) wafers.
8. 4  Bandwidth
8. 4.1
Two   issues   affect   the   bandwid th   of   the
roughness  results.    The  first  is  the  bandwidth  of  the
roughness measuring tool, which is discussed in Section</p><h1>7</h1><ol start="7"><li>The  second  bandwidth  effect  is  from  the  analysis
software,  which  is  user  selected  to  emphasize  certain
spatial   frequencies.      Both   long   and   short   spatial
wavelength (or frequency) limits must be defined in μm
(or μm
-1
).   When   entering   this   information   into   a
measurement,  specification  wavelength  units  shall  be
used.    Profiling  instruments  should  have  scan  length
and  bandwidth  adjusted  according  to  DIN  4768  and
4777 or ASME B46.1.</li><li>5
Precision</li><li>5.1
The   precision   of   the   roughness    measuring
instrument  (P)  is  important.    The  relationship  between
P and the tolerance of the parts to be characterized (T)
is often called the P/T Ratio.  SEMI M27 describes how
to    determine    and    interpret    the    factors:    “A    test
instrument  is  usually  deemed  to  be  suitable  for  the
purpose  if  P/T  lies  below  10%.    If  P/T  is  greater  than
30%,  the  test  instrument  is  not  likely  to  be  suitable  for
the  purpose.    Cases  for  which  P/T  lies  between  10%
and   30%   must   be   judged   on   an   individual   basis,
depending  on  the  requirements  being  placed  on  the
measurement system.”

RELATED INFORMATION 1
EXPERIMENTS AND MODELS RELATING TO ROUGHNESS
DISTRIBUTION OF SILICON WAFERS
NOTE:  This  related  information  is  not  an  official  part  of
SEMI  M40  but  was  approved  for  publication  by  full  letter
ballot procedures.
R1-1  Executive Summary
R1-1.1    Roughness  is  measured  traditionally  only  on
selected  spots  on  a  surface  and  only  a  few  methods,
such  as  light  scattering,  are  practical  for  a  complete
surface  scan.    Therefore  a  systematic,  standardized
approach  is  required  for  defining  the  roughness  of  the
entire  surface  of  a  silicon  wafer.    This  can  be  done  by
defining  one  or  several  patterns  of  measurement  spots
which  represent  the  entire  surface  so  that  the  deviation
of  the  average  roughness  and  its  standard  deviation
from  the  “true”  values  are  small.    The  task  of  finding
such patterns and verifying that they represent the entire
surface    was    approached    in    two    steps:    1.        by
investigating various patterns on various wafer surfaces
experimentally, and 2. by simulating the roughness map
of  surfaces  and  by  applying  the  selected  patterns  to
them.
R1-1.2    Five  different  site  patterns  were  used  for  the
experimental  investigation  of  silicon  wafer  surfaces
which  were  final  polished,  stock  removal  polished  and
acid  etched.  The  patterns  consist  of  one,  five,  nine,  ten
and thirteen points (thirteen being the sum of a five and
nine point pattern), respectively, and the measurements
were  performed  with  10,  30,  80  and  250  μm  filter
lengths.    Therefore  20  average  roughness  values  and
corresponding  standard  deviations  were  obtained  for
every wafer investigated, five for any filter length.
R1-1.3  Haze maps of these surfaces either displayed no
variation,  variations  with  an  approximately  rotational
symmetry or a gradient across the surface, respectively.
The  average  roughness  of  the  surfaces  measured  with
the  various  site  patterns  varied  over  four  and  a  half
orders  of  magnitude  for  the  set  of  wafers  used  and  the
filter  settings  selected.    The  corresponding  standard
deviations  were  found  to  be  &lt;10%  of  the  average
roughness  with  the  exception  of  four  200  mm  final
polished  wafers  where  standard  deviations  up  to  50-
60%  occurred.    The  5-,  9-  and  10-point  site  patterns
were  compared  with  respect  to  the  average  roughness
and  the  corresponding  standard  deviation  for  every
wafer.      The   variation   (standard   deviation)   of   the
average   roughness   and   the   standard   deviations   as
measured    were    found    to    be    smaller    than    or
approximately 10% in any case when normalized to the
total  average  roughness  of  the  corresponding  wafer
(average over all points of all patterns for a wafer).
R1-1.4      Roughness   maps   were   generated   for   the
simulation  according  to  three  different  models:  maps
with a roughness pattern with rotational symmetry, with
a linear gradient and with mirror symmetry.  Two maps
with  a  pixel  size  of  1  mm
2
were  generated  for  each
surface  to  take  into  account  any  anisotropy  of  the
roughness,  and  center  roughness  and  edge  roughness,
respectively,  were  used  as  free  parameters  for  both
maps.  These parameters were varied between two level
(0.1  and  0.2)  for  both  maps  resulting  in  a  2
5
factorial
design   of   “experiment”   where   the   symmetry   was
considered as 5
th
parameter.  The 1-, 5- and 9-point site
patterns  were  applied  to  the  various  maps  and  the
average roughness and standard deviation of roughness
were  calculated  as  well  as  the  true  values  using  all
points  of  a  map.    Strong  effects  were  observed  for  the
1-point  pattern.    As  expected  one  point  in  the  wafer
center   does   in   general   not   represent   the   average
roughness of the entire surface reasonably well.  The 5-
point  measurement  provides  the  correct  average  ±  6%,
the  9-point  measurement  is  ±  2.5%.    Similarly,  the  5-
point  standard  deviation  is  correct  ±  1.6%  and  the  9-
point one is ± 1%.  Second order effects were found to
be  smaller  than  the  main  effects.    Therefore  it  is
concluded   that   the   suggested   five   and   nine   point
measurement  patterns  provide  a  good  estimate  of  the
roughness  of  an  entire  surface  and  its  variations  for
reasonably homogeneous Si wafer surfaces.
R1-2  Introduction
R1-2.1      Roughness   measurement   of   surfaces   is
performed   with   a   variety   of   techniques,   the   most
common  ones  being  mechanical  or  optical  profiling  in
real space or light scattering in reciprocal space (1,2,3).
The   numerical   result   of   a   roughness   measurement
process  depends  significantly  on  several  parameters
such  as  spatial  bandwidth  of  the  response  function  of
the  tool  used  including  filtering,  scan  length,  probe
diameter, scanning speed etc.  These parameters are not
independent  of  each  other  and  have  been  standardized
only  for  mechanical  profilers  (e.g.4,5).    The  roughness
values  reported  by  different  types  of  tools  usually  do
not  agree  but  they  correlate  provided  their  parameters
were  set  up  not  too  differently  (6).    The  standardized
roughness  metrics  such  as  average  roughness  R
a
or
root-mean-square  roughness  R
q
refer  mainly  to  line
scans  as  performed  by  profiling  techniques  (e.g.  7).
Area  scans  performed  by  profiling  tools  by  aligning  a
series of line scans are usually very slow.  Scanning the
entire  surface  of  a  Si  wafer  with  a  profiler  therefore</p><p>SEMI M40-0200 © SEMI 200014
would   consume   many   hours,   in   the   case   of   AFM
(Atomic Force Microscope) many years.
R1-2.2      Techniques   based   on   light   scattering   are
capable   of   scanning   the   entire   wafer   surface   quite
rapidly,  in  about  1-2  min.    Their  response  function,
however,   has   a   limited   spatial   bandwidth   ranging
approximately  from  0.5  to  40  μm.    Standards  for  light
scattering measurements are now emerging (8,9).
R1-2.3        The    obvious    solution    for    obtaining    a
standardized  roughness  value  of  an  entire  surface  is  a)
to   define   a   pattern   of   sites   where   one-   or   two-
dimensional  scans  are  performed  and  b)  to  report  the
significant   parameters   along   with   the   measurement
(roughness)   result.   The   second   task   can   be   solved
theoretically by collecting the important parameters and
by  designing  an  appropriate  abbreviation  code.    The
first  task  requires  experiments  to  collect  data  about  the
variation  of  roughness  across  a  typical,  real  wafer
surface  and  numerical  simulations  to  find  a  set  of  sites
the roughness of which agrees sufficiently well with the
roughness of the entire surface.
R1-2.4        This    appendix    reports    the    results    of
corresponding  roughness  measurements  as  well  as  of  a
numerical    simulation    using    a    virtual    design-of-
experiment (DOX).
R1-3  Roughness Definitions
R1-3.1    A  variety  of  definitions  for  roughness  have
been    standardized    by    national    and    international
institutions     in     the     US,     Japan     and     Europe.
Corresponding  standards  are  listed  in  section  5  of  the
main   document   and   some   selected   ones   again   in
reference  7.    Most  widely  used  are  average  roughness
R
a
and  root-mean-square  roughness  R
q
.    Both  refer  to
the average deviation of a profile from a reference line.
R1-4  Roughness Measurements
R1-4.1  Experimental Details
R1-4.1.1      Four   groups   of   four   wafers   each   were
investigated   to   collect   data   about   the   variation   of
roughness  across  the  wafer  surface.  The  wafers  were
selected   to   represent   different   process   steps   and
polishing techniques:
a)
final polished wafers, 150 mm, #1-4
b)
final polished wafers, 200 mm, #4-8
c)
pre-polished wafers, 200 mm, #9-12
d)
acid-etched wafers, 200 mm, #13-16.
R1-4.1.2    The  wafers  were  characterized  for  haze  with
an    SSIS    (Censor    ANS-100)    and    the    roughness
measurements  were  performed  with  an  optical  non-
contact profiler (Chapman MP-2000+).  The roughness
data  were  taken  by  performing  scans  of  length  3  mm
and  were  evaluated  using  filters  of  19,  30,  80  and  250
μm,  respectively.    The  scans  were  performed  at  a
variety  of  sites  according  to  four  different  site  patterns
as displayed in Figure R1-1 where also the directions of
the various scans are indicated:
i)center of wafer, one scan
ii)    five points, center of wafer plus four points at 2/3
of radius
iii)   nine points, center of wafer plus four points at 2/5
of radius plus four points at 4/5 of radius
iv)   ten points, two in the center of wafer plus four
points at ½ of radius and four points at radius
minus 10 mm.
v)    thirteen points, combination of pattern ii and iii.

R1-4.2  Results
R1-4.2.1    The  average  values  of  each  site  pattern  is  reported  here  together  with  the  corresponding  standard
deviation.    The  average  might  be  considered  as  the  characteristic  roughness  of  the  entire  surface  whereas  the
standard deviation is a measure of roughness inhomogeneity.  The results are summarized in Tables R1-1 and R1-3.
These  averages  and  standard  deviations  are  called  site  average  or  site  standard  deviation  for  the  respective  site
patterns for each wafer and each filter length applied.
R1-4.2.2    The  variation  in  average  values  obtained  with  the  different  site  patterns  employed  can  be  obtained  by
calculating 1) the average ofthe individual site averages and the standard deviation for each wafer and 2) the average
of the individual site standard deviations and the corresponding standard deviation.  These averages are called wafer
average  and  wafer  standard  deviation,  respectively.    The  corresponding  standard  deviations  are  called  standard
deviation of wafer average and standard deviation of wafer standard deviation.  They are reported in Table R1-3 and
Table R1-5 and in Figure R1-2 and Figure R1-3.
R1-4.2.3    The  site  average  roughness  values  found  range  from  0.09  A  for  final  polished  wafers  to  350  A  for  acid
etched wafers for a 10 μm filter and from about 5 A to 2200 A, respectively, for a 250 μm filter. In total, a range of
about  four  and  a  half  orders  of  magnitude  is  covered.    The  site  standard  deviation  for  the  different  site  patterns  is
around  10-15%  of  the  average  roughness  of  the  wafer  indicating  a  homogeneous  roughness  of  the  wafer  surfaces.
The  difference  between  the  site  patterns  ii,  iii,  iv  and  v  for  the  relative  site  standard  deviation  is  small,  typically
about 1-2 %.  Exceptions are for the 200 mm final polished wafers with standard deviations of about 50-60% for the
10 μm filter.
R1-4.2.4  According to the values in Tables R1-3 &amp; R1-5, the standard deviations of the wafer averages are less than
10 % in any case (Figure RI).  The standard deviations of the various site standard deviations (Figure A3) are also
smaller than or about 10 % with respect to the wafer average.  This indicates that in the present case any site pattern
—with  the  exception  of  the  single  site  measurement  at  the  wafer  center—represents  the  “true”  mean  roughness  of
the entire surface and its standard deviation reasonably well.

R1-5  Models of Roughness Distribution and
their Evaluation with a Virtual Experiment of
Factorial Design
R1-5.1  Goal of the Simulation
R1-5.1.1    Roughness  is  measured  on  the  entire  wafer
surface  only  in  rare  cases.    Therefore  approximations
have  to  be  found  which  represent  the  roughness  of  an
entire  wafer  surface  with  appropriate  accuracy.    Three
discrete site patterns were defined in section 9 of SEMI
M40,     which     are     thought     to     provide     such
approximations.  Performing many measurements using
these  site  patterns  is  one  approach  to  assess  these  site
patterns   with   respect   to   their   validity.      Another
approach  is  to  simulate  roughness  variations  across  a
wafer surface and apply the site patterns to them.  This
allows  easy  and  systematic  variations  of  the  surface
roughness properties and maps.  The assessment of the
results  again  has  to  be  performed  in  a  systematic  way.
An appropriate tool for doing this is to utilize a factorial
design  for  the  variables  in  the  various  surface  models
used.      The   goal   of   finding   a   site   pattern   which
represents   the   entire   surface   is   considered   to   be
achieved  when  the  variations  of  the  variables  of  the
different   surface   models   result   in   a   non-significant
effect in the evaluation of the factorial design.
R1-5.2  Simulation of Roughness Maps
R1-5.2.1    The  measurement  results  that  are  reported  in
section  3  provide  some  insight  into  the  variation  of
roughness   that   occurs   across   actual,   typical   wafer
surfaces.      The   variation   observed   on   the   different
wafers  is  related  to  the  specific  polishing  technique
(wax  mount  polishing,  wax  free  polishing)  and  to  the
polishing  parameters  used.    Examination  of  haze  maps
reveals three basic patterns of variation:
a)
a circularly symmetric haze variation
b)
a haze variation approximately symmetric with
respect to a diameter across the wafer
c)
a linear gradient of haze from one wafer edge to
the opposite one.
R1-5.2.2  The following relations were used to simulate
the variation of roughness according to these three basic
models  a)-c)  with  e  and  c  being  the  roughness  values
near the edge and at the center of a wafer, respectively:
model a: a parabolic relation
z(x,y) = (x
2
+y
2
) (e-c)/r
2</p><ul><li>c                     (equ. 1)
model b: a semi-cylindrical relation
z(x,y) = (r
2
-(y cos a – x sin a)
2
)
1/2
(e-c)/r + e
(equ. 2)
model c: a linear gradient
z(x,y) = (y cos a - x sin a) (e-c)/r + c       (equ. 3)
with  wafer  radius  r  and  angle  α  corresponding  to  the
angle  between  the  symmetry  plane  and  the  x-direction
(model  b)  or  the  direction  of  the  gradient  and  the  y-
direction (model c).
R1-5.2.3    Using  equations  1-3,  roughness  maps  of
wafer surfaces can be generated with a roughness value
assigned  to  each  site.    This  was  performed  by  using
MathCad®  software  and  by  assuming  200  mm  wafers,
the  area  of  each  being  partitioned  into  sites  of  1  mm
2
size.
R1-5.2.4    Roughness  is  not  necessarily  an  isotropic
property of a surface.  Different roughness values are in
general  obtained  when  e.g.  two  scans  are  performed  at
the  same  spot  on  a  wafer  surface  but  in  perpendicular
directions.      Therefore   two   maps   representing   the
roughness  anisotropy  were  generated  in  each  case  by
assuming  two  sets  of  the  parameters  e  and  c  –  e1,  c1,
e2, and c2, per wafer surface.
R1-5.3  Factorial Design
R1-5.3.1    A  factorial  design  at  two  levels  was  selected
in  order  to  compare  the  various  wafer  maps  generated
(10).    The  parameters  ei  and  ci  (i  =  1,2)  were  used  as
variables  and  were  varied  between  two  levels,  0.1  and</li></ul><ol start="0"><li>2, in arbitrary units.  In addition the patterns (models
a  –  c)  were  also  used  as  a  variable  and  the  values  –1
and  +1  were  correspondingly  assigned  resulting  in  a  2
5
factorial design.  The complete set of parameters used is
displayed in Table R1-5.

R1-5.3.2    Wafer  roughness  maps  with  1  mm
2
pixel  size  were  generated  using  all  possible  32  combinations  of  the
parameters in Table R1-5.  Average roughness and standard deviation were calculated by using all pixels of a map
(avgtrue, stdabwtrue) as well as by using the three discrete site patterns displayed in Figure 1 of the main part of this
document (avg1, avg5, avg9, stdabw5, stdabw9).  Corresponding results for comparing models a and b are displayed
in  Table  R1-6.    These  values  were  normalized  for  further  evaluation,  the  averages  with  respect  to  avgtrue
(ravgi=avgi/avgtrue,   i=1,5,9),   the   standard   deviations   with   respect   to   their   difference   to   the   “true”   value
((rstdabwi=stdabwi.-stdabwtrue)  /  stdabwtrue,  i=5,9)  (Table  R1-7).    Results  for  comparing  models  a  and  c  are
similar and are not reported here in detail.
R1-5.3.3    The  averages  for  ravg1,5,9  over  the  various  variable  sets  differ  by  less  than  1%  from  unity.    The
corresponding standard deviations decrease from 27% to 5% going from ravg1 to ravg9, respectively, indicating 
as one would expect  that ravg9 is a much more precise value for the roughness of the entire surface as compared
to ravg1 or ravg5.  The relative standard deviations rstdabw5,9 deviate in the average by about 12% from the true
value. The corresponding standard deviations differ not much for rstdabw5 and rstdabw9.
R1-5.3.4    More  detailed  information  is  obtained  when  the  results  are  evaluated  according  to  the  factorial  design
used.    The  1
st
to  5
th
order  effects  of  varying  the  variables  were  calculated  by  applying  using  a  table  of  contrast
coefficients /10/ to the normalized results of the simulation. The 1
st
order  or main  effects are the difference of
the  observations  for  both  levels  of  one  parameter  and  averages  over  all  other  observations.    They  measure  the
average  effect  of  a  variable  over  all  conditions  of  the  other  variables.    The  2
nd
order  effects  are  a  measure  for  the
interaction of variables and are obtained by calculating one half of the difference of the average effect of variable 1
with variable 2 at level 1 and variable 1 with variable 2 at level 2. 3
rd
order and higher effects are not considered in
the present work.  They are assumed to be negligible and are used to calculate the variance of an effect (=square root
of the average of the squares of 3
rd
to 5
th
order effects).
R1-5.3.5    The  result  of  this  evaluation  is  displayed  in  Table  R1-8  and  Table  R1-9  for  the  main  (1
st
order)  and  2
nd
order effects, respectively.

pronounced effects are observed for ravg5 and 9.  Note that the opposite effect occurs for center 2 as this point is not
included  in  calculating  ravg1,5  or  9.    Also  note  that  the  influence  of  the  variables  edge1  or  edge2  is  much  less</p><p>SEMI M40-0200 © SEMI 200023
pronounced.  In any case, the 5-point measurement provides the correct average ± 6%, the 9-point measurement ±
2. 5%.  In a similar way, the 5-point standard deviation is correct ± 1.6% and the 9-point standard deviation ± 1%.

Factorial Design for Models a and b
R1-5.3.7  The significance of numbers given in Table R1-8 and Table R1-9 can be estimated only in relation to the
noise or variance of the observables which is also displayed in both tables.  The signal-to-noise ratio S/N is obtained
by using a logarithmic measure:
S/N = 10 log (effect
2
/variance)
R1-5.3.8  The corresponding S/N values for the main and for the second order effects are listed in Table R1-10 and
Table R1-11.
R1-5.3.9    A  linear  signal-to-noise  ratio  of  3:1  is  commonly  used  to  distinguish  significant  data  from  insignificant
data.  This linear ratio corresponds to a S/N of about 10 in the present case of a logarithmic signal-to- noise ration.
The S/N ratios  10 are shaded lightly gray in Table R1-10 and Table R1-11.  The variables center1,2 and edge1,2
have a significant effect on the relative averages ravg1,5,9.  Mainly the interactions of the model selected with the
other variables are significant for the relative averages ravg1,5,9 and the interaction of center1 and center2 for the
relative  standard  deviations  rstdabw5,9.    The  other  cases  emphasized  in  Table  R1-11  by  shading  have  a  S/N  ratio
only slightly larger than 10.

R1-5.3.10  The interactions are discussed for two examples, ravg9 and rstdabw5 (Table R1-12).  Going from sym lo
(model  a,  parabolic  symmetry)  to  sym  hi  (model  b,  cylindrical  symmetry)  and  keeping  c1  fixed  at  the  lo  level
decreases ravg9 from 0.993 to 0.963 whereas it increases from 1.007 to 1.037 when c1 is kept fixed at the lo level.
This change in opposite directions indicate an interaction between c1 and sym. c1 and c2 interact in a similar way
with respect to rstdabw5.

R1-5.4  Summary and Conclusions
R1-5.4.1    Three  different  models  for  surface  roughness  distribution  (roughness  maps)  were  investigated  and  three
different site patterns for measuring the roughness were applied to them. The parameters of the models – roughness
in the center and near the edge of the wafer – were used as variables in a factorial design and varied between two
levels.  Average roughness and the corresponding standard deviations calculated for the site patterns were compared
with the “true” values obtained by evaluating all points of the roughness map.
R1-5.4.2  The patterns where the roughness is measured at five or nine points exhibit a standard deviation of 7 and 5
%,  respectively,  from  the  true  average  value  for  all  possible  combinations  of  the  variables.    The  average  of  the
standard deviations of the roughness distribution of the single variable sets differs by about 13% from the true value
for  the  five-  as  well  as  nine-point  site  pattern.    A  standard  deviation  of  the  standard  deviations  of  about  11%  is
obtained by averaging over the 32 different variables sets.
R1-5.4.3  The evaluation of the factorial design outlines that the variation of the variables c1, c2, e1, and e2 has a
significant effect – with respect to “noise” – on the average roughness values but not on the corresponding standard
deviations.    Varying  the  surface  model  does  not  significantly  affect  the  averages  and  standard  deviations.    Some
second  order  effects  or  interactions  are  also  significant  but  less  pronounced  than  the  main  effects.    A  pronounced
interaction  of  the  variables  c1  and  c2  occurs  e.g.  for  the  five  point  standard  deviation  rstdabw5.    This  interaction
could  be  reduced  by  introducing  an  additional  site  for  measuring  roughness  in  the  center  of  the  wafer  with  a
direction perpendicular to the present one.
R1-5.4.4  The goal of finding a site pattern which results only in non-significant effects is not completely achieved
by  the  five  and  nine  point  patterns  utilized  in  the  present  work.    However,  they  allow  to  measure  the  average
roughness of wide variety of surface roughness distributions with a one sigma deviation of 5-7 %, or a three sigma
deviation of 15-21 %.  These values are certainly more than sufficient for present wafer surfaces.</p><p>SEMI M40-0200 © SEMI 200025

JEIDA 50 — Standard Specification for SOI Wafers
NOTE 1: Unless   otherwise   indicated,   all   documents   cited
shall be the latest published versions.
4  Terminology
4. 1  Many   terms   relating   to   silicon   technology   are
defined  in  ASTM  Terminology  F1241,  “Terminology
of Silicon Technology.”
4. 2  Other terms are defined as follows:
4. 2.1  base silicon wafer — the silicon wafer below the
insulator layer, supporting the top silicon film.
4. 2.2  bonded  wafers  —  defined  as  two  silicon  wafers
bonded together with an insulating layer.  This insulator
layer is typically thermally grown silicon-dioxide.
4. 2.3  bonding interface — the plane where the bonding
between the two wafers takes place.
4. 2.4  buried  oxide  layer  (BOX)  —   the  insulator  layer
between  the  two  wafers  when  the  insulator  layer  is
silicon-dioxide.
4. 2.5  non-SOI  edge  area  —  an  annulus  between  the
nominal  radius  of  the  surface  silicon  layer  and  the
nominal  radius  of  the  base  silicon  wafer  (for  bonded
SOI  wafers).    The  annulus  which  implies  an  area  is
determined  by  its  width  as  one  dimension.    It  is  the
difference  in  the  nominal  radius  of  the  surface  silicon
layer and that of the base silicon wafer.
4. 2.6  thickness   of   top   silicon   film   —    the   distance
between  the  surface  of  the  top  silicon  film  and  the  top
silicon film-buried oxide interface.
4. 2.7  top  silicon  film  —  the  silicon  layer  on  top  of  the
insulator   film   in   which   the   semiconductor   active
devices are fabricated.
4. 2.8  void  —  the  absence  of  a  chemical  bond  at  the
bonding interface.
5  Ordering Information
