Values ofthese variables will be available to the host through collection event reports and host status queries.20.2 Requirements20.2.1 All generic variable data items defined in GEM are required by all PSEM300 equipment. Any supplier-defined variables shall be documented in the same format used by this document. The following minimuminformation is required:20.3 Data Types20.3.1 Equipment constants remain in effect until they are overwritten either by manual entry or by a NewEquipment Constant Send remote command. Equipment constants have various uses in PSEM300, including thefollowing:"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 4 --",">"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E130-1104 \xa9 SEMI 2003, 2004 18 1) Equipment offsets that match the performance of several pieces of equipment that would otherwise performdifferently due to inherent manufacturing differences. Examples are home values and motion axis scalingfactors.2) Setting the configuration of the equipment to allow for different material specifications, equipment options,material flows, frequency of automatic functions, etc.3) Managing optional machine features. Examples are constants that tell the system whether optional substrate IDreaders are present and control the configuration and function of these optional subsystems when they arepresent.20.3.2 Status Variables are valid at all times. A status variable may not be changed by the host but may bechanged by the equipment or operator. The value of the status variables may be queried by the host at anytime usingthe Selected Equipment Status Request remote command (See SEMI E30). Data variables are variables that arevalid only upon the occurrence of specific collection events. An attempt to read a data variable at the wrong timewill not generate an error, but the data reported may not have relevant meaning.20.3.3 Data Types and SizesTable 5 Data Types and SizesType Size DefinitionString 032767 A string of ASCII characters from zero to Size characters in length.Integer 1,2,4 An integer value that may be represented by Size bytes.

The followingminimum information is required: Class: Format: Description: 6.3 Data Types6.3.1 Equipment Constants (ECVs) can be changed by the host using S2,F15 (New Equipment Constant Send). Theoperator may be able to change some values, but the equipment does not change the values on its own. The value ofan equipment constant may be queried by the host at any time, using the S2,F13/14 transaction. They reside in non-volatile memory of the equipment. Equipment constants remain in effect until they are overwritten either by manualentry or by a S2,F15.6.3.2 Status Variables (SVs) are valid at all times. An SV may not be changed by the host but may be changed bythe equipment or operator. The value of status variables may be queried by the host at anytime using the S1,F3/4 orS6,F19/20 transactions.6.3.3 DVVALs are variables that are valid only upon the occurrence of specific collection events.

Current edition approved by theNorth American Regional Standards Committee on July 11, 2004 and August 16, 2004. Initially available at",(0,a.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.semi.org"},"www.semi.org")," September 2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published March 2004;previously published July 2004. NOTICE: The designation of SEMI E132 was updated during the 0305 publishing cycle to reflect the creation ofSEMI E132.1. 1 Purpose1.1 This specification describes a method for restricting access to communication with equipment by requiringclients to authenticate to the equipment before proceeding with subsequent communication, and provides a flexibleauthorization scheme to control client application access. Authorization allows parties who want to exchangeinformation with or control the equipment to do so on a need-to-know and/or need-to-use basis.1.2 The authorization scheme specified in this standard allows equipment vendor the flexibility to provide accesscontrol at any level of granularity, ranging from no access control restrictions, predefined role-based access control,to very fine-grained control. 2 Scope2.1 This is a standard that applies to all semiconductor manufacturing equipment that requires authentication andauthorization for its services. It does not apply to communication that is governed by the SEMI E30 communicationand control state models.2.2 This standard does not require data transmitted over an established session to be encrypted, encryption is onlyrequired as specified by the authentication protocol. It is assumed that the interface specified by this standard willbe operating in an environment where there are no malicious attacks such as inside a closed factory network.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine theapplicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 3 Limitations3.1 An adjunct standard will need to be defined that maps specific technologies and protocols to the definedconcepts in this document. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardsSEMI E30  Generic Model for Communications and Control of SEMI Equipment (GEM)4.2 Other StandardsUniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax, IETF RFC 2396, August 1998(",(0,a.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt)NOTICE"},"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt)NOTICE"),": Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Referenced Documents5.1 Unified Modeling Language (UML) Specification, Version 1.4, OMG Specification 01-09-67,",(0,a.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/modeling%5C_spec%5C_catalog.htm"},"http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/modeling\\_spec\\_catalog.htm")),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 49 --",">"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E132-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2004, 2005 2 6 Terminology6.1 Definitions6.1.1 administration  the process of configuring equipment client identities, associated credentials, and settingauthorizations.6.1.2 Asymmetric Key Cryptography  see Public Key Cryptography.6.1.3 authenticated communications  communications with equipment compliant to this specification to establishan authenticated session, to grant authorizations and for administration. This includes any communications over theauthenticated session. Note that authenticated communications are not necessarily encrypted.6.1.4 authenticated session  also referred to as session in this document, this is an application-level conceptdefined by this specification and is independent of any physical or logical connection or communication protocolsession layer used in the actual exchange of messages. An authenticated session or session follows the sessionestablishment procedure, state models, and the defined services as described in this specification.6.1.5 authentication  the process of determining whether a user or process is, in fact, who or what it is declared tobe. In private and public computer networks, authentication is often achieved through the use of passwords.Knowledge of the password is assumed to guarantee that the user is authentic. This standard refers only to theauthentication of application processes, and does not support or address authentication of human users.6.1.6 authorization  the process of granting the privilege to perform a specific action to a user or process. Notethat the user or process must be authenticated before authorization may take place.6.1.7 client  an application process that communicates with the equipment to access equipment resources. Thisspecification uses the terms client and client application interchangeably.6.1.8 communication session  a series of two-way message exchanges between a client and the equipment. Asession typically begins and ends at the request of the client.6.1.9 cryptographic algorithm  a transformation of meaningful data into some meaningless data, a process calledencryption. If the transformation is reversible, then the reverse process is called decryption. Typically it iscomputationally difficult to correctly decrypt the data without knowing both the algorithm used and some additionalinformation, referred to as keys.6.1.10 encryption  see cryptographic algorithm.6.1.11 message digest  see one-way hash.6.1.12 one-way hash  a one-way transformation of an arbitrary length of data into a fixed-length code. Thetransformation is computationally difficult to reverse, and unlikely to have collisions. The same message willalways result in the same hash, and any slight modification to the original message will result in a different hash,thus providing message integrity. The terms One-way Hash, Hash and Digest are used interchangeably in thisdocument.6.1.13 Persistent Session  an Authenticated Session established that survives equipment shutdowns or power offs,it is set to persistent by a client through an equipment service defined in this specification. Behavior of a persistentsession during equipment shutdown and startup is as defined by the session state model described in this document.6.1.14 Public Key Cryptography (PKC)  also known as Asymmetric Key Cryptography, a cryptographicalgorithm that employs two keys for encryption and decryption of data. One key is designated as the public key andcan be freely advertised, while the other key, designated as the private key, is never revealed. Data encrypted withone key can only be decrypted with the other key. PKC is widely used for key exchange and message signing.6.1.15 Secret Key Cryptography (SKC)  also known as Symmetric Key Cryptography, a cryptographic algorithmthat employs one single key for both encryption and decryption. SKC is widely used for bulk encryption of data dueto its speed over PKC.6.1.16 Session  in this document, the term session refers to an Authenticated Session unless specified otherwise.It has no relation to the sessions that may be defined elsewhere.6.1.17 Symmetric Key Cryptography  see Secret Key Cryptography."),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 50 --",">"),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E132-0305 \xa9 SEMI 2004, 20053 7 Conventions7.1 Unified Modeling Language (UML) Notation  All class and sequence diagrams in this standard make use ofthe Unified Modeling Language notation.7.2 Attribute Tables  The table below provides an example of the tables used to list and describe attributes ofclasses defined in this specification.Table 1 Attribute Table Format Attribute Name Definition FormSee list below. 7.2.1 Form  Defines the data type of the attribute.
