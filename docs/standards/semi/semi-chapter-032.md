SEMI E32.1-0997 © SEMI 1994, 19971 SEMI E32.1-0997SECS-II SUPPORT FOR MATERIAL MOVEMENT 1 IntroductionThis document contains the necessary information to implement the Material Movement Management standardusing the SEMI E5 SECS-II communications protocol. 2 Service to Message Mapp ingThe table below lists each message service defined in the Material Movement standard with the SECS-II messagewhich should be used to perform that service. Service SECS-II Msg CommentsTRJobCreate S4,F19 1TRJobCreate Response S4,F20TRJobCommand S4,F21TRJobCommand Response S4,F22TRJobAlert S4,F23TRJobEvent S6,F11 2 Corresponding messages to enable reporting, create and linkreports, etc. are also assumed.GetAttribute S1,F19 3GetAttribute Response S1,F20 3HOReady S4,F27HOCommand S4,F29HOCommand Response S4,F31HOVerify S4,F33HOVerify Response S4,F33HOCancelReady S4,F35HOCancelReady Response S4,F37HOHalt S4,F39HOHalt Response S4,F411 If the S4,F19 message is multi-block, it will require the S4,F25/F26 multi-block inquire/grant transaction.2 TRJobEvent is an unconfirmed service. While the required S6,F12 reply must be transferred by the protocol layer, there is no action required onthe part of the host. Therefore, it shall be discarded rather than delivered to the application which employs this service.3 The GetAttributes request and response will be removed from E32 and E32.1 in 1998. This message transaction is replaced by GetAttr,S14F1/F2. See E39 and E39.1 for details. 3 Parameter to Data Item/Pa rameter MappingIn the table below, each parameter used in the SEMI E32 messaging services is listed along with its correspondingSECS-II data item. In some cases, a parameter will correspond to a SECS-II list. These cases are noted.SEMI E32 defines a number of message parameters as conditional. This means that under certain conditions, theseparameters do not need to be included in the message. In SEMI E5, this is done by means of a zero length data item,or if the parameter is a list, a zero length list. Please refer to SEMI E5, Zero Length Items and Lists, Sections 6.2.1and 6.3.1.

That is, it is not clear which partnershould be the SECS-I host and which the SECS-Iequipment. As a general rule, if one partner is alwaysthe primary transfer partner, it should be configured asthe SECS-I host. However, this is not a requirement,since in some cases the choice of which is the primarypartner may depend upon the situation. Therefore,where SECS-I is used to link the transfer partners, eachpartner should be user-configurable as either host orequipment.

SEMI E36-0704  1995, 20041 SEMI E36-0704SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INFORMATIONTAGGING SPECIFICATION This specification was technically approved by the Global Information & Control Committee and is the directresponsibility of the North American Information & Control Committee. Current edition approved by theNorth American Regional Standards Committee on December 18, 1998. Initially available at www.semi.orgFebruary 1999; to be published June 1999. Originally published 1995; previous published revision February1998.This document replaces SEMI E36-0298 in its entirety.NOTICE: The designation of this standard was updated during the 0704 publishing cycle to reflect the creation ofSEMI E36.1.NOTE: The Document Type Definitions, schemas, anddocumentation defined in other parts of SemiconductorEquipment Manufacturing Information Tagging may beused freely without permission or payment of royaltiesor other licensing charge, provided this source and/or itsassociated specifications are cited. 1 PurposeThe purpose of Semiconductor EquipmentManufacturing Information Tagging is to define amarkup philosophy, a markup framework, and aninformation markup which is rich enough to facilitate: Electronic interchange and distribution ofinformation; Quality hardcopy printing and screen display ofinformation; Consistent high-precision online searching; and Reuse and repurposing of information for suchapplications as integrating source material intotraining material and online support applications.The intent of this document is to create an informationinterchange specification, not an authoring specificationor an electronic presentation specification.Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing InformationTagging will define the markup necessary forexchanging documents electronically, for facilitatingretrieval of information content, and for validatinginformation interchanges. 2 Scope2.1 Information Scope - Semiconductor EquipmentManufacturing Information Tagging is intended tocover the types of technical and commercialinformation typically needed to support the selection,installation, use, and maintenance of semiconductormanufacturing equipment.The following list gives examples of information typeswithin scope; this list is not exhaustive.  Operations Manuals/Guides  typically used byequipment operators at customer sites to performthe tasks for which the equipment was designed. Installation Manuals  typically used by supplierand customer engineers to install the equipment atthe customer site. Maintenance Manuals  typically used by trainedmaintenance technicians at customer sites toperform repair and upkeep of equipment. Maintenance Schedules  typically used by sitecoordinators and customer facility managers toschedule and document normal preventivemaintenance. Spares/Parts Lists  typically used by on-site fieldservice engineers and customers to maintain asufficient stocking level to ensure prompt deliveryof parts. Repair/Troubleshooting Manuals  typically usedby equipment operators and qualified maintenancetechnicians to identify and correct equipmentproblems. Release Notes  typically used by operators,technicians and system administrators to identifychanges in software configuration. Training Manuals  typically used by suppliertraining personnel and customers to train operatorsand maintenance technicians.Additional information on potential use and re-use ofthese information types in electronic form can be foundin the Auxiliary Information for this specification. 2.2 Content of SEMI E36 - Semiconductor EquipmentManufacturing Information Tagging will be issued inthree parts: this base document,

&lt;!-- Page 5 --&gt;

SEMI E36-0704  1995, 2004 2  associated information models such as SGML andXML Document Type Definitions (DTDs) andschema, and the documentation for these information models,including at least a comprehensive Tag Library.Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing InformationTagging does not include implementation advice,suggestions, or notes on how to implement the modelsdescribed here. This material will be presented in theform of Auxiliary Information associated withSemiconductor Equipment Manufacturing InformationTagging.Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing InformationTagging by design does not include tutorials on SGML,XML, how to use the defined elements or modules, orhow to create document content. 2.3 SGML and XML  Any documents marked upaccording to Semiconductor Equipment ManufacturingInformation Tagging will be valid XML documents:that is, well-formed XML documents that have anassociated document type declaration and that complywith the constraints expressed therein. Since validXML documents are by definition type-valid SGMLdocuments, such documents will be valid SGMLdocuments as well.Initially, information models will be maintained in bothXML and SGML, with all changes made in parallel.SEMI will issue a dual set of models whenever achange is made, and both will always be (within thelimits of their syntax) the same. Although parallelmaintenance is unfortunate, it is intended to make iteasier for members to create documents using currentSGML or XML tools. As Web-SGMLimplementations and alternative XML schema syntaxbecome more common, modules may be maintained inother syntactic forms. 2.4 Examples of SEMI Content Specifications - Thereare other SEMI standards and specifications thatregulate the content of a document. SemiconductorEquipment Manufacturing Information Tagging isexpressly not in conflict with any of them, since itspecifies only how to identify the content present in thedocuments, and in some contexts, how to electronicallystructure the content. Semiconductor EquipmentManufacturing Information Tagging does not addresswhat information is to be included. Examples of SEMIcontent-related or content guideline-related standardsand specifications can be seen in section 7. 3 Referenced DocumentsSemiconductor Equipment Manufacturing InformationTagging references the following information standards, which should be referred to in their entiretyfor full details: 3.1 ISO Standards1International Standard for SGML; ISO-8879-1986 asmodified by Amendment 1, of 1988HyTime Standard ISO 10744 revision 2, which isreferenced for hypertext linking 3.2 Other references2The Extensible Markup Language (XML)V 1.0Recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium(W3C)The draft W3C specifications for Extensible LinkingLanguage (XLL). 4 Terminology4.1 Attribute - An attribute is a markup construct thatresides within the start tag of an element to provideadditional information about the element. (Note: thestart tag is the tag that is placed directly before theelement in the datastream and determines where theelement begins.)4.2 Conforming Authoring Application - A conformingauthoring application must be able to produceconforming documents. There is no requirement that allinternal work in the application be performed in themarkup described by Semiconductor EquipmentManufacturing Information Tagging, only that the endproduct, exported for interchange, must be aconforming document.4.3 Conforming Document - A conforming document isone that meets the markup rules and specificinformation models defined in SemiconductorEquipment Manufacturing Information Tagging for theclass of document. This specification comprises threeparts: this base document, a set of information models,and the documentation for those models. A conformingdocument must conform to all three parts.A conforming document created by one applicationmust be interchangeable with a conforming applicationwithout significant information loss.NOTE: Explicit rendering instructions such as fontfamily and type size are not considered to be significantinformation. 1 ISO Central Secretariat, 1, rue de Varemb, Case postale 56, CH-1211 Genev 20, Switzerland. http://www.iso.ch2 World Wide Web Consortium, Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology Laboratory for Computer Science, 545 TechnologySquare, Cambridge, MA 02139. http://www.w3.org

SEMI E36-0704  1995, 20043 4.4 Conforming Element - A conforming element isone that uses the names and markup rules defined inSemiconductor Equipment Manufacturing InformationTagging for the class of element. A conforming elementcreated by a conforming application must beinterchangeable with another conforming applicationwithout information loss.4.5 Conforming Rendering Application - Rendering(presentation) is the process and means by which theelements in a document shall be made visually orotherwise understandable to the end user, for example,printing a document on paper, browsing a series ofelements on screen, or stating a series of elementsthrough voice synthesis. A conforming renderingapplication must be able to print or display conformingdocuments without significant loss of information. Thepresentation should be consistent with the intent of theoriginating system.A conforming rendering application may not imposestructural requirements that are not required by theDTD or other document models as stated in the secondpart of Semiconductor Equipment ManufacturingInformation Tagging. For example, a rendering enginemay not require an element which is optional in themodels or require an attribute that is implied. Arendering application may require that the rules in thisBase Specification and those in the Tag Library arefollowed.For example, if the DTDs say that an element isoptional, a Rendering Application may not require thatit be present. If the Tag Library says that the contentsof an element must be some particular information, theRendering Application may require that it be so. Morespecifically, if the element is optional, aRendering Application may not fail to process adocument because it does not contain s.If the Tag Library says that the contents of adatechanged attribute is a date in YYYYMMDDformat, a Rendering Application may fail if the attributedoes not contain a valid date. 4.6 Document - A logical assembly of elements, that, ifcorrectly ordered, is a means of transmitting aninternally consistent piece of information. A documentis made up of one or more elements which must all becontained in one root element.4.7 Document Class - A document class consists of allof the documents or information fragments that follow asingle set of markup rules, including the same elementsand element relationships. In general, a class ofdocuments can be considered to be documents that arenearly the same in structure and have similar types ofcontent. A document class is usually (but not necessarily) defined by a structural model (such as aDTD or Schema) that governs its existence.4.8 Document Exchange - For SEMI E36, documentexchange is synonymous with document interchange(see definition).4.9 Document Interchange - Document interchangeentails passing one or more elements, usually as adocument, from one conforming system to one or moreother systems (also known as exchange).4.10 Document Model - Document model is a termfor a set of structural rules that describe the legalmarkup for a particular class of documents. DTDs andSchema are types of document models.4.11 Document Type Definition (DTD) - A DTD is adocument model or list of markup rules, which may beused in both SGML and XML. As specified in theSGML standard, ISO 8879, a DTD is:Rules, determined by an application, that applySGML to the markup of documents of a particulartype. A document type definition includes a formalspecification, expressed in a document typedeclaration, of the element types, elementrelationships and attributes and references that canbe represented by markup. It thereby defines thevocabulary of the markup for which SGML definesthe syntax. (ISO 8879 4.105) 4.12 Element - An element is one named, contiguouspiece of information in the information stream. Usuallythe data within an element has a semantic or structuralrelationship as well, for example a persons surname, anerror code, a pointer to external data, a paragraph, or aprocedure that contains steps. In the previous versionof this specification (i.e., in SEMI E36-95) an elementis also referred to as an information component.An element is: A uniquely addressable unit of information withinthe document; and/or An identifier to an addressable unit of informationoutside the document. 4.13 Markup - For Semiconductor EquipmentManufacturing Information Tagging, markup is definedas additional data characters that are added to data toprovide information about the data and make the datamore useable. The markup described by SemiconductorEquipment Manufacturing Information Tagging isinternal markup, that is, markup which resides in thesame data stream as the data  in specific SGML andXML markup.4.14 Nonconforming Document - A non-conformingdocument is one that does not use the markup properly

&lt;!-- Page 7 --&gt;

SEMI E36-0704  1995, 2004 4 or follow the markup rules defined in SemiconductorEquipment Manufacturing Information Tagging.4.15 SGML - SGML is Standard Generalized MarkupLanguage. The Standard Generalized MarkupLanguage is an International Organization forStandardization (ISO) standard. The ISO ReferenceNumber is ISO 8879:1986(E). SGML is a meta-language for constructing markup. See also XML(Extensible Markup Language).4.16 Tag - A tag is a string of characters delimited byrules set out in the SGML standard (and used in XMLand HTML). Tags are placed in the datastream toindicate where an element begins and ends. InSemiconductor Equipment Manufacturing InformationTagging, tags match as closely as possible the names ofthe elements in English.4.17 XLL (Extensible Linking Language) - Whenreleased, XLL is intended to be the syntax andsemantics for both simple hypertext linking (asexemplified by HTML) and more complex linking,providing such functionality as multi-way links, multi-ended links, and addressing from an external documentbased on structure. A W3C Working Group is in theprocess of producing a draft specification, which usesmany of the concepts from HyTime(Hypermedia/Time-based Document RepresentationLanguage ISO/IEC 10744) and the TEI (Text EncodingInitiative) extended pointers.4.18 XML (Extensible Markup Language) - XML is aW3C Recommendation that describes a subset ofSGML syntax and functionality intended for use on theWorld Wide Web. XML is, by design, simpler, lesscomplex, and easier to implement than SGML. XML isalso, by design, far less flexible than SGML because itincludes only the most commonly implemented SGMLfeatures.XML is a family of Recommendations that includes alinking specification (XLL); it may in the future includeother specifications such as a stylesheet specification(XSL). The XLL linking specification will provide thesyntax for hypertext links defined in SemiconductorEquipment Manufacturing Information Tagging. TheXSL stylesheet language will be neither mandated norprohibited in SEMI E36-98. 5 Design and Principles5.1 Information Markup - For purposes of interchange,information will be marked-up according to theconventions established in Semiconductor EquipmentManufacturing Information Tagging. The definedmarkup will:  Identify the start and end of elements, which maycontain named information content or structuralcomponents; Provide information concerning the identifiedelements; and Specify connections among elements and betweenelements and external objects.Applications will be able to utilize this markup to: Select, limit, and organize specific elements forreuse or interchange; Start and stop behavior, such as print formatting,complex screen display, and the actuation ofprograms; Limit retrieval (for increased precision); Generate navigation aids such as indexes and tablesof contents; and Validate document structure or content. 5.2 SGML Standard and XML Family ofRecommendations - The intent of SemiconductorEquipment Manufacturing Information Tagging is todefine the rules and markup that can be used to createXML data (which is, by definition, SGML data) formaximum interchangeability and movement across bothinternets and intranets. Therefore all markup and ruleswill be designed to be fully conforming with the W3CXML Recommendation. It is also the intent to describehypertext linking in conformance with the XLL(Extensible Linking Language), as much as it is known,and to migrate in the direction of that recommendationas the recommendation is finished.Since the intent of Semiconductor EquipmentManufacturing Information Tagging is to create datathat is both valid XML and type-valid SGML: The DTDs, which will be written in both SGMLand XML syntax, will conform to the XML subsetof SGML by not using features and syntax thatXML prohibits such as exceptions and #CONREFattributes; Tagged data produced according to SemiconductorEquipment Manufacturing Information Taggingwill be valid XML. Early implementers usingSGML authoring or conversion tools should checkwith their tool suppliers to make sure those toolswill work with their document withoutmodification.Names of elements, attributes, and entities will be usedconsistently within the SEMI E36 module set. Whilesome elements may have different content models from

&lt;!-- Page 8 --&gt;

SEMI E36-0704  1995, 20045 module to module, and in fact that is the intent of theparameter entity framework, all name definitions anduse will be consistent throughout the SEMI E36 DTDsuite. This means that namespace issues, such as thoseaddressed by the XML Namespace Recommendation(currently under development), are not relevant withinthe scope of SEMI E36. It is likely that mechanismssuch as XML Namespaces will be used to incorporateparts of the SEMI E36 markup set in other applications;but this use is outside the scope of SEMI E36 itself. 5.3 Specification for Interchange - SemiconductorEquipment Manufacturing Information Tagging definesmarkup optimized for interchange, not for informationdevelopment (authoring) nor for informationpresentation (rendering). Thus, some of the capabilitiesand functionality that might be desired for authoring orrendering will not be included in the markup rules, bydesign. For example, few elements may be required andthe sequence of elements will not be tightly constrained.It is anticipated that more specific authoring andrendering models may be developed by other parties aspart of conforming applications. All conforminginterchange, however, will explicitly follow the markupand structural rules defined in SemiconductorEquipment Manufacturing Information Tagging. 5.4 General Modeling Principles Document (information) models will beconstructed that name the elements, describe therelationships among these elements, and imposecertain markup or content constraints. Theinformation markup will be controlled by thesemodels. All models will be made available by SEMI anddistributed and balloted as additional parts ofSemiconductor Equipment ManufacturingInformation Tagging. Models will be described inthe second part of Semiconductor EquipmentManufacturing Information Tagging rather thanincluded in the base document directly because themodels are assumed to be dynamic documents thatwill grow and change as requirements alter. Thedata models and the Tag Library may be ballotedseparately without requiring a re-balloting of thispart of the specification. The models will initially be in the form of SGMLand XML Document Type Definitions (DTDs) andmay later include other XML-defining schema. There will be no all-inclusive general informationmodels; each DTD or other collection of rules willmodel specific elements or specific documenttypes.  Markup will be primarily designed according to thenature of the information being described; suchconsiderations as data volume and ease ofimplementation will only be consideredsecondarily. DTDs will be constructed in a modular fashion,with content-related or structurally-relatedmodules. The purpose of such modularization is toreuse existing information content models as muchas possible. New element structures should becreated only when new content is analyzed. 5.5 Information Modeling5.5.1 Types of Elements - SGML and XML elementscan identify many types of information. There aresituations in which each of the following element typesare appropriate, and many situations in which severalcould be used. In designing structures and taggingdocuments, elements should be designed using thefollowing hierarchy of types, from most- to least-preferred. Only if the information cannot besatisfactorily identified using one type of elementshould those below it in the following list beconsidered. Content Elements  those that identify theinformation content, such as Warning, ProceduralStep, Part Number, Installation Manual, or Bill ofMaterials. Structural Elements  those that identify thestructural role of a part of a document, such asTitle, Paragraph, or List Item. Pointer Elements  those that point to otherlocations, either in this document or another, suchas Cross-reference, Footnote Reference, or URL. Format Elements  those that identify portions ofa document that are to be formatted differentlyfrom surrounding text and for which there is noContent, Structural, or Pointing reason that theyshould be so formatted, for example a Boldelement. Format elements are to be used as a lastresort; use of a content, structure, or pointerelement with a format-related attribute is preferableto use of a format element. 5.5.2 Naming Elements - Markup in the DTDs will benamed consistently across contexts. That is, the sameelement name will be used for an element that canoccur in many places with the same function, regardlessof the location. For example, there is only one elementfor Title, not many separate elements for Section Title,Table Title, Figure Title, etc.In XML, names are case-sensitive. In the interest ofkeeping compliant with XML, all names will be case-

&lt;!-- Page 9 --&gt;

SEMI E36-0704  1995, 2004 6 sensitive. (In SGML, names may not be case-sensitivesince such names may be case-folded to upper case atany time.) All element tag names should be in lowercase. Entity names and attribute names may be mixedcase, lower case, or upper case to match common usageof the name involved. If there is no such consideration,lower case should be used. Attribute values should bein lower case unless there is a good reason to makethem another case, such as a list of state or countrycodes which would naturally appear in upper case. 5.5.3 Recursive Structures - In cases where an elementmay contain one or more of the same elements withinitself, there are several styles of modeling the solution: Use recursive structures. (In recursion, an elementwould be allowed to contain itself, thus a

could contain one or more

s, which couldthemselves contain

s, etc.); Create an explicit hierarchy by naming the toplevel and lower levels. (Thus a

couldcontain one or more , which couldthemselves contain one or more ,etc.); or Create an explicit hierarchy by numbering the toplevel as 1, and subsequent levels as 2, 3, etc.(Thus a could contain one or mores, which could themselves contain oneor more s, etc.).In such cases, recursion should be used to model anelement because it is optimal for authoring, editing, anddata reuse; in such an environment an editor can move asection from one level to another without needing tomodify the tagging inside the section. 5.5.4 Content Modeling - To create SGML elementsthat are maximally re-useable and compatible withXML, there are several SGML modeling capabilitiesthat are prohibited in SEMI E36: RCDATA and CDATA declared content (characterdata in which elements and entities cannot berecognized) are prohibited. The AND connector (which specifies that all theelements so connected are required but that order isirrelevant) is prohibited. Inclusions and Exclusions to content models areprohibited. Pernicious mixed element content is prohibited.This means that if an element model containscharacter data it must allow character data at anyplace in the model. In practice this means that anymixed content model groups should be repeatable| (or) groups. In addition, the following rules also will apply: Each element must be declared separately; No inline comments or empty comments will bepermitted; only full comment declarations may beused; The replacement text for external parameter entitiesmust be well-formed, as per the XML specificationdeclarations; The entity types CDATA, PI, and bracketed textare prohibited; No Marked Sections are allowed in the DTDs; and External entities must include both a SYSTEM anda PUBLIC identifier. 5.5.5 Attributes - The attribute list for each elementmust be declared separately. Attribute values must notcontain references to external entities. If a DeclaredValue is not a specified list, only the followingDeclared Value keywords may be used: CDATA (character data); ID (a unique identifier for the element within itscurrent document); IDREF and IDREFS (one or more pointer to theIDs of other elements within the same document); ENTITY or ENTITIES (the name of one or moredefined entities); and NMTOKEN or NMTOKENS (one or more wordsthat consist entirely of name characters).On all attribute declarations, attribute values specifiedas defaults must be literals. Only the following DefaultValues keywords may be used: #REQUIRED (must be present); #IMPLIED (optional, may be implied by theapplication); and #FIXED (set, not able to be changed). 5.6 Formatting from Element Context versus fromAttributes - The use of formatting attributes to indicatepreferred rendition in display or print should be limitedto situations in which no other mechanism is available.That is, if the desired formatting can be accomplishedby use of the element name alone, or based on thecontext in which the element appears, no formattingattributes should be used. Elements should only carryformatting attributes such as type-size if there is noother mechanism to pass this information or if an authoror editor, rather than the output system, must control thepresentation directly. Formatting attributes, when used,

&lt;!-- Page 10 --&gt;

SEMI E36-0704  1995, 20047 should be optional and considered advisory by therendering agent.5.7 Data Markup Rules - To create SGML documentsthat are maximally re-useable and compatible withXML, the following restrictions are placed upon thetagged instances produced in accordance withSemiconductor Equipment Manufacturing InformationTagging: The characters &lt; and & must always beescaped as &lt; and & respectively. No Marked Sections will be allowed in datacontent. The replacement text of general text entities mustbe well-formed, for example, an element that startswithin an entity must also end within it. All attributes should be present (even defaultattributes) and attribute values should be well-formed, that is with the name, equal sign, andquotation marks present. Processing Instructions are prohibited with theexception of the XML declaration, for example:. 6 How Semiconductor EquipmentManufacturing Information Tagging Should BeUsed6.1 Conformance - A conforming document is one thatmeets the markup rules defined for the document classin Semiconductor Equipment ManufacturingInformation Tagging. A non-conforming document isone that does not use the markup properly or follow themarkup rules defined in Semiconductor EquipmentManufacturing Information Tagging. A conformingdocument created by an application must beinterchangeable with another conforming applicationwithout significant information loss. A conformingapplication may also deliver the markup rules(information models) for the document or informationclass being interchanged to another system.Conforming applications are those that create, render,or work with conforming documents. Such applicationsmay include browsers and online rendering software,print and composition engines, editors and authoringsystems, search and retrieval engines, etc. In additionto strictly conforming applications, it is expected thatmany applications will accept conforming documents asinput, converting them to the internal format of thesoftware. 6.1.1 Conforming Authoring Application - Aconforming authoring application must be able toproduce conforming information. An application may state that it is conformant with SemiconductorEquipment Manufacturing Information Tagging if it hasthe ability to: Create and manipulate conforming documents; Create and manipulate one or more classes ofconforming documents; Import conforming documents into the applicationand output matching conforming documents; or Turn non-conforming documents into conformingdocuments. 6.1.2 Conforming Rendering Application - There is norendering specification stated or required bySemiconductor Equipment Manufacturing InformationTagging at this time. This specification does not definestyle conventions or endorse any particular language forthe interchange of stylistic information. That said, aconforming rendering application is one that can render(print, display, pronounce, etc.) conforming documentswithout significant loss of information. Thepresentation should be consistent with the intent of theoriginating system, but need not be an exact, facsimile-reproduction match.To call itself conforming, a rendering application mustbe able to take any conforming document, which is bydefinition legal according to this base specification andthe models defined and explained in other parts of thespecification, and render that document in some visualor non-visual fashion. A conforming renderingapplication may not impose additional requirements orconstraints such as content requirements. For example,a rendering engine may not require the presence of anelement that is optional in the models or require a morerestrictive range of values for an attribute than themodels state. 6.1.3 Validation - Documents tagged according toSemiconductor Equipment Manufacturing InformationTagging must parse cleanly according to their SGML orXML models and must follow the rules stated in thisbase document and the Tag Library and otherdocumentation. Tagging validation must beaccomplished through the use of validating SGML orXML parsers, in standalone form or as incorporatedinto other software packages. (Note: Validation ofsome of the rules described in this base document andthe Tag Library documentation cannot be accomplishedusing only an XML or SGML parser. This does notmean that such rules can be ignored, merely that othervalidation techniques may be required.) SEMI E36rules include both rules that can be checked withsoftware and content rules that can only be verifiedintellectually; a conforming SEMI E36 document mustconform to both types of rules.

SEMI E36-0704  1995, 2004 8 6.2 Maintenance of Semiconductor EquipmentManufacturing Information Tagging - This base portionof the SEMI E36 specification is intended to be debatedand balloted once and change little over time.Additional parts of the specification will contain theactual information models that describe the markup tobe used. New information models may be proposed atany time. Such models will be distributed, discussed,and balloted individually or in small groups, in the formof one or more SEMI E36 modules, as they are created.Modules that are approved will be appended toSemiconductor Equipment Manufacturing InformationTagging. The documentation will be changed andballoted in parallel, to match any changes in the models.6.2.1 Module Library - A growing module librarycontaining all approved modules will be maintained,adding modules as additional subject areas anddocument types are defined. Once a module has beenapproved, it will be provided as part of SemiconductorEquipment Manufacturing Information Tagging. Place-holding modules may be introduced into the library thatare designated as Temporary, for use only until aformal analysis and balloting process can provide amore appropriate module. Initially modules will beXML and SGML DTDs and DTD fragments. As XMLalternative modeling syntaxes such as schema becomesupported by software, these may be used tosupplement SEMI E36 information models.6.2.2 Modules - Each module will be given a uniqueshort name (to be used as a file name), a versionnumber, and a unique public identifier writtenaccording to the rules of ISO 8879 and incorporatingthe version number.File names will be all lower case, constructed byconcatenating the following, in order: A 3- to 8-character descriptive name; A hyphen; The file type as xml or sgml; A period; and A 3-character descriptive extension that defines thetype of file (such as dec, sgm, etc.) Theseextensions will be defined in the Tag Library.Each module will contain: An initial comment which names the module, statesthe purpose of the modules, types the modules asTemporary or Implemented, and states how themodule should be integrated with other modules; A growing change history comment that describes(in sedimentary order; that is, the most recent at thetop) all modifications made to the model. Each item in the change history should be numbered,dated, provide a description of the change, give abrief rationale, and name the changing agent. Whatever syntax is employed, internal commentsshould be used throughout the module to name anddescribe the elements and provide information thatmay not be stated directly in the syntax used. 6.2.3 Consolidated Tag Library - A single,consolidated Tag Library will be maintained which willdescribe the elements, attributes, and entities defined inall the modules. Each description will containsufficient detail to indicate the meaning and correctusage of the data markup. The library (or changes tothe library) will be reissued whenever a module isadded or modified in a way that affects any of theelements, attributes, or entities.Modules should use elements (tags) that are already inthe Tag Library wherever the definition of the elementmatches the need. If the definition of an existing tagdoes not meet the need, a new tag should be created.A diagram of the structure of each element will beincluded in the Tag Library, except for elements thatare empty, contain only character data, or contain asimple or group in which all contents may appear atany point in the model.For each element, the Tag Library will contain: Element Title, consisting of its Tag and Name; Definition in clear, plain English, includingdescription of intended use and application whenappropriate; Remarks (if needed); Related Elements (if needed); For each Source, or module in which the element isdefined: Attributes Associated with the Element (ifany); The model of the Element in SGML syntaxand narrative form; Presentation information (if needed); Formatted examples of the element (ifneeded); Tagged examples of the elements (if needed);and The Name of the Source, or module in whichthe element is defined.For each Attribute, the Tag Library will contain:

&lt;!-- Page 12 --&gt;

SEMI E36-0704  1995, 20049  Attribute Title, consisting of the short form of theattribute which appears in the documents, and theattribute Name; Attribute usage, describing how that attribute isused; For each possible value of an attribute with aspecified set of values, the meaning or implicationsof each value; and The default value of the attribute. 6.3 Creation of More Specific Authoring or RenderingModels - The DTDs and models described inSemiconductor Equipment Manufacturing InformationTagging will not be designed for optimal use indocument creation. To create and display documents,data creators may wish to create more enforcingauthoring models based on this markup. Such authoringmodels may: Require the presence of specific elements; Specify the sequence of elements; and/or Include additional elements for internal use (whichwould need to be removed before interchange). Forexample, such information might include elementsfor tracking the internal authoring and validationprocesses or for company-confidential information.Similarly, it is likely that viewing, print rendition,search and retrieval, or other display applications willcreate display-only models based on SemiconductorEquipment Manufacturing Information Tagging. Toload display tools, it is quite likely that the specifiedmodels will be transformed into a form that isoptimized for the particular search and retrieval ordisplay system. Such display models might: Resequence the data; Add additional markup such as container tagsaround structures to be considered one element forformatting purposes; Transform the form of some elements; or Remove parts of the information that are notrelevant to a particular application. 7 Related Documents - SEMI ContentStandards and SpecificationsAs described in section 2.4, the following list containsexamples of SEMI content-related or content guideline-related standards and specifications.

First, organizing the work into thesesegments makes each segment more coherent. Next, layering the segments provides a flexible means for adoptingthe standard incrementally.6.1.1 The metadata depends on the identity layer. The internal structure layer implies the identity layer.6.2 Identifiers  The use of identifiers is critical in the design. Each of the levels requires them to function. Thereason is that being able to unambiguously identify an item independently of the item itself enables elegant solutionsto many problems: Item Versioning

SEMI E36.1-0704 © SEMI 20047  Item Security Item Lookup Distributed Metadata Efficient Distribution6.3 Externalizing Information  Many XML initiatives focus on rigorously defining rich structure for Elements.The current approach has been the opposite, to externalize as much structure as possible.6.3.1 This approach is to promote flexibility and simplicity. The objective was to provide a small set of powerfulmodeling primitives from which richer models may be built. Providing a mechanism for distributing relatedinformation among different locations allows systems to capitalize on this property for economic efficiency. Themetadata model allows content to be stored in some sort of native XML format, while associated metadata ismaintained in a relational database system. This creates more options for users.6.4 Utilizing RDF as the Basis for Metadata  Level 2 type and metadata is based on the existing XML standardfor metadata called the Resource Description Framework (RDF). RDF provides a very simple, but very powerfulmodel of information that is easy to understand and process. RDF allows flexible extension of the metadata standardwithout having to modify existing schema definitions. This will allow users to incorporate future key learnings intothe standard.6.5 Tag and Attribute Selection  A large number of tags and attributes were considered for possible inclusion inthe standard. In making decisions about which of the many possibilities to choose as the basis of this work, severalfactors were considered. First representative users of the information were interviewed to identify concepts andrelationships that they considered to be important and valuable. Tags resulting from this work were given highpriority relative to tags that derived from other sources. Next, semantic or conceptual tags were favored over tagsderived from structural or physical properties of the service documents. Finally, tags determined to have broadutility were chosen in favor of tags considered useful in only a limited context.6.5.1 Once a reasonable set of tags were selected for inclusion, a set of attributes was produced for those tags. Thebasic approach was to determine an attribute set that was necessary and sufficient for making the informationcaptured by the tags economical to produce and beneficial to end users.

SEMI E36.1-0704 © SEMI 2004 8 RELATED INFORMATION 1IDENTITY AND METADATA EXAMPLE NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E36.1 and was derived from the work of theNorth American Information & Control committee. This related information was approved for publication by fullletter ballot on March 14, 2004. R1-1 Identity and Metadata ExampleR1-1.1 This section illustrates the use of the identity and metadata defined in the standard. The material shownbelow was produced using a tool called the RDF Validation Service available on the web athttp://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/. Given a candidate XML/RDF document, the tool will first validate thedocument for compliance with the RDF specification. Next, the document is parsed and represented in threealternative forms: the original XML version, a tabular version, and a graphical version.R1-1.2 The graph shows that the sample RDF document contains five elements, as shown by the five ellipses on theleft side of the graphic. These items are the subjects of the RDF model. These are the items we are associatingmetadata. Each subject has a URI embedded within; this URI points to the content that the subject refers to. Thisbinds metadata to a subject in a completely different context than that in which the subjects content is developed.R1-1.3 Emanating from the subjects are arrows. Each of these arrows defines a relationship between the subject andanother information item. The nature of the relationship is indicated as a label on the arc and corresponds to one ofthe relationships defined in the E36 RDF model.R1-1.4 These arrows terminate on graphics representing the object of the relationship. In cases where theterminating graphic is a box, the object of the relationship is a literal value such as a number, date, or phrase. Whenthe terminating graphic is an oval, this is an indication that the object of the relationship is another resource.

HSMS usesTCP/IP stream support, which provides reliable twoway simultaneous transmision of streams of contiguousbytes. It can be used as a replacement for SECS-Icommunication as well as other more advancedcommunications environments.The procedure for HSMS communications parallels themore familiar SECS-I communications it replaces. Thefollowing steps are followed for any communications(HSMS or otherwise):1. Obtain a communications link between twoentities. In SECS-I, this is the RS232 wirephysically connecting host and equipment. InHSMS, the link is a TCP/IP connection obtained bythe standard TCP/IP connect procedure. Note thatthe abstract term entity is used instead of hostor equipment. This is because, while HSMS isused for SECS-I replacement, it has more generalapplications as well. In a SECS-I replacementapplication, the host is an entity and theequipment is an entity.2. Establish the application protocol conventions tobe used for exchanging data messages between twoentities. For SECS-I, this step is implicit in the factthat semiconductor equipment is physicallyconnected on the two ends of the wire: the protocolis SECS-II.In the case of HSMS, the communications link is adynamically established TCP/IP connection on aphysical link which may be shared with many otherTCP/IP connections using protocols other thanHSMS or connections using non TCP/IP protocols.HSMS adds a message exchange (called the Selectprocedure) which is used to confirm to both entitiesthat the particular TCP/IP connection is to be usedexlusively for HSMS communications.3. Exchange Data. This is the normal intendedpurpose of the communications link. In both SECS-I and HSMS, the procedure is to exchangeSECS-II encoded messages for the control ofsemiconductor equipment and/or processes. Dataexchange normally continues until one or both ofthe entities are taken off-line for equipment-specific purposes, such as maintenance.4. Formally end communications. In SECS-I, there isno formal requirement here; the equipment to betaken off-line stops communicating.In HSMS, a message exchange (either thebilateral Deselect procedure or the unilateralseparate procedure) is used for both parties toconfirm that the TCP/IP connection is no longerneeded for HSMS communications.5. Break the communications link. In SECS-I, this isdone by physically unplugging the host orequipment from the communications cable, whichonly occurs during repair or physicalreconfiguration of the factory networkenvironment.In HSMS, since it uses the dynamic connectionenvironment of TCP/IP, the TCP/IP connection islogically broken via a release or a disconnectprocedure without any physical disconnect fromthe network medium.Two additional procedures, of a diagnostic nature, aresupported in HSMS, which are generally not requiredby a simple SECS-I link or a SECS-I directreplacement. These follow:1. Linktest. This procedure provides a simpleconfirmation of connection integrity.2. Reject. Because HSMS is intended to be extendedto protocols other than just SECS-II (by means ofsubsidiary standards), it is possible that two entitiescan be connected (due to a configuration error)which use incompatible subsidiary standards. Also,during initial implementation, incorrect messagetypes may be sent, or they may be sent out of orderdue to software bugs. The reject procedure is usedto indicate such an occurrence.5.1 HSMS Connection State Diagram  The HSMSstate machine is illustrated in the diagram below. Thebehavior described in this diagram defines the basicrequirements of HSMS: subsidiary standards mayfurther extend these or other states.

SEMI E37-0303 © SEM 1995, 20035 6 Use of TCP/IP6.1 TCP/IP API  The specification of a required TCPApplication Program Interface (API) for use inimplementations is outside the scope of HSMS. A givenHSMS implementation may use any TCP/IP API sockets, TLI (Transport Layer Interface), etc. appropriate to the intended hardware and softwareplatform, as long as it provides interoperable TCP/IPstreams protocol on the network.The appendix contains examples of the TCP/IPprocedures referenced in this standard and samplescenarios using both the TLI (POSIX standard 1003.12)and the popular BSD socket model for TCP/IPcommunication.6.2 TCP/IP Network Addressing Conventions6.2.1 IP Addresses  Each physical TCP/IPconnection to a given Local Area Network (LAN) musthave a unique IP Address. IP Addresses must beassignable at installation time, and an HSMSimplementation cannot select a fixed IP Address. Atypical IP Address is 192.9.200.1.IP imposes restrictions on these numbers which areoutside the scope of the HSMS protocol. ConsultSection 2.3 of RFC 791, Internet Protocol (IP) inSection 3.6.2.2 TCP Port Numbers  A TCP Port Number canbe considered as an extension of the IP Address.HSMS implementations should allow configuring TCPPort to the full range of the TCP/IP implementationused. A typical TCP Port Number is 5000.Conventions have been established for selecting TCPPort Numbers which are outside the scope of the HSMSprotocol. Consult RFC 793, Transmission ControlProtocol (TCP) in Section 3.6.3 Establishing a TCP/IP Connection6.3.1 Connect Modes  The procedures forestablishing a TCP/IP connection are defined in RFC793. However, not all the procedures defined by RFC793 are supported by commonly available APIs. Inparticular, while RFC 793 permits both entities toinitiate the connection simultaneously, this feature israrely supported in availableAPIs. Therefore, HSMS restricts an entity to one of thefollowing modes: Passive Mode. The Passive mode is used when thelocal entity listens for and accepts a connectprocedure initiated by the Remote Entity.  Active Mode. The Active mode is used when theconnect procedure is initiated by the Local Entity. The appendix provides an example of how an entitymay operate alternately in the active and passive modesto achieve greater flexibility in establishingcommunications.6.3.2 Passive Mode Connect Procedure  Theprocedure followed by the Passive Local Entity isdefined in RFC 793. It is summarized as follows:1. Obtain a connection endpoint and bind it to apublished port.2. Listen for an incoming connect request to thepublished port from a remote entity.3. Upon receipt of a connect request, acknowledge itand indicate acceptance of the connection. At thispoint, the connect procedure has completedsuccessfully, and the CONNECTED state isentered (Section 5).These procedures are carried out through the API of thelocal entity's implementation of TCP/IP. Theappendices provide the API-specific procedures for theabove steps using both TLI and BSD.NOTE: A failure may occur during the above steps. Thereason for failure may be local entity-specific or may be dueto a lack of any connect request after a local entity-specifictimeout. The action to be taken (for example: return to step 1to retry) is a local entity-specific issue.NOTE: See Section 9, Special Considerations, for issuesrelating to multiple connection requests to the same passivemode entity.6.3.3 Active Mode Connect Procedure  Theprocedure followed by the Active Local Entity isdefined in RFC 793. It is summarized as follows:1. Obtain a connection endpoint.2. Initiate a connection to the published port of apassive mode remote entity.3. Wait for the receipt of the acknowledge and theacceptance of the connect request from the remoteentity. Receipt of the acceptance from the remote

&lt;!-- Page 34 --&gt;

SEMI E37-0303 © SEMI 1995, 2003 6 entity indicates successful completion of theconnect procedure, and the CONNECTED state isentered (Section 5).These procedures are carried out through the API of thelocal entity's implementation of TCP/IP. The appendixprovides the API-specific procedures for the abovesteps using both TLI and BSD.NOTE: A failure may occur during the above steps. Thereason for failure may be local entity-specific or may be dueto a lack of any accept message after a local entity-specifictimeout. The action to be taken is a local entity-specific issue.If, however, the local entity intends to retry the connection, itshould do so subject to the T5 connect separation timeout (seeSpecial Considerations).6.4 Terminating a TCP/IP Connection  Connectiontermination is the logical inverse of Connectionestablishment. From the Local Entity's perspective, aTCP/IP connection may be broken at any time.However, HSMS only permits termination of theconnection when the connection is in the NOTSELECTED substate of the CONNECTED state.The procedures for termination of a connection aredefined in RFC 793. Either entity may initiatetermination of the connection. The NOT CONNECTEDstate is entered, indicating the end of HSMScommunications. The appendix illustrates theprocedures for both release and disconnect using theTLI and BSD APIs. 7 HSMS Message Exchange ProceduresHSMS defines the procedures for all message exchangebetween entities across the TCP/IP connectionestablished according to the procedures in the previoussection. As explained in the overview, once theconnection is established, the two entities establishHSMS communications with the Select procedure.Then data messages may be exchanged in eitherdirection at any time. When the entities wish to endHSMS communications, the Deselect or Separateprocedure is used to end HSMS communications.7.1 Sending and Receiving HSMS Messages  AllHSMS procedures involve the exchange of HSMSmessages. These messages are sent and received asTCP/IP streams using the previously establishedTCP/IP connection at standard priority. In particular,the use of Urgent data is not supported under HSMS(see RFC 793 for more information on send and receiveprocedures).The appendix gives examples of sending and receivingHSMS messages using both TLI and BSD socket APIs.7.2 Select Procedure  The Select procedure is usedto establish HSMS communications on a TCP/IP connection using the Select.req and Select.rsp messagesin a control transaction. Although HSMS permits Select at any time in theCONNECTED state, subsidiary standards may furtherrequire the connection to be in the NOT SELECTEDsubstate (see Special Considerations).7.2.1 Initiator Procedure  The procedure followedby the initiator is as follows.1. The initiator of the select procedure sends theSelect.req message to the responding entity.2. If the initiator receives a Select.rsp with a SelectStatus of 0, The HSMS Select procedure completessuccessfully and the SELECTED state is entered(see Section 5).3. If the initiator receives a Select.rsp with a non-zeroSelect Status, the Select completes unsuccessfully(no state transitions).4. If the T6 timeout expires in the initiator beforereceipt of a Select.rsp, it is considered acommunications failure (see SpecialConsiderations).7.2.2 Responding Entity Procedure  The procedurefollowed by the responding entity is as follows.1. The responding entity receives the Select.req.2. If the responding entity is able to accept the select,it transmits the Select.rsp with a Select Status of 0.The HSMS Select Procedure for the respondingentity is successfully completed, and theSELECTED state is entered (see Section 5).3. If the responding entity is unable to permit theselect, it transmits the Select.rsp with a non-zeroSelect Status. The HSMS Select Procedure for theresponding entity completes unsuccessfully (nostate transitions).7.2.3 Simultaneous Select Procedures  If thesubsidiary standards do not restrict the use of the Select,it is possible that both entities simultaneously initiateSelect Procedures with identical SessionIDs. In such acase, each entity will accept the other entity's selectrequest by responding with a Select.rsp.

&lt;!-- Page 35 --&gt;

SEMI E37-0303 © SEM 1995, 20037 7.3 Data Procedure  HSMS data messages may beinitiated by either entity as long as the connection is inthe SELECTED state. Receipt of a data message whennot in the SELECTED state will result in a rejectprocedure (see Section 7.7).Data messages may be further defined as part of a datatransaction as either a Primary or Reply datamessage. In a data transaction, the initiator of thetransaction sends a primary message to the respondingentity. If the Primary message indicates that a reply isexpected, a Reply message is sent by the respondingentity in response to the Primary.The following types of Data Transactions aresupported:1. Primary Message with reply expected and theassociated Reply Message.2. Primary Message with no reply expected. The specific procedures for these transactions aredetermined by the application layer and are subject toother standards (for example, E5 and E30 for GEMequipment using SECS-II encoded messages).The applicable upper layer standard is identified by themessage type. The type is determined from the specificformat defined in Section 8. The normal type for HSMSmessages is SECS-II text. Also refer to SpecialConsiderations concerning the T3 Reply Timeout.7.4 Deselect Procedure  The Deselect procedure isused to provide a graceful end to HSMScommunication for an entity prior to breaking theTCP/IP connection. HSMS requires that the connectionbe in the SELECTED state. The procedure is asfollows. 7.4.1 Initiator Procedure1. The initiator of the Deselect procedure sends theDeselect.req message to the responding entity.2. If the initiator receives a Deselect.rsp with aDeselect Status of 0, its Deselect procedureterminates successfully. The NOT SELECTEDstate is entered (see Section 5).3. If the initiator receives a Deselect.rsp with a non-zero Deselect Status, its Deselect procedureterminates unsuccessfully. No state change occurs.4. If the T6 timeout expires in the initiator beforereceipt of a Deselect.rsp, it is considered acommunications failure (see SpecialConsiderations).7.4.2 Responding Entity Procedure1. The responding entity receives the Deselect.reqmessage.2. If the responding entity is in the SELECTED state,and if it is able to permit the Deselect, it respondsusing the Deselect.rsp with a zero response code.The responding entity's Deselect procedurecompletes successfully. The NOT SELECTEDstate is entered (see Section 5).3. If the responding entity is unable to permit theDeselect, either because it is not in the SELECTEDstate or because local conditions do not permit theDeselect, it responds using the Deselect.rsp with anon-zero response code. The responding entity'sDeselect procedure terminates unsuccessfully. Nostate change occurs.7.4.3 Simultaneous Deselect Procedures  If thesubsidiary standards do not restrict the use of theDeselect, it is possible that both entities simultaneouslyinitiate Deselect Procedures with identical SessionIDs.In such a case, each entity will accept the other entity'sDeselect request by responding with the deselect.rsp.

Its use is valid anytime in theCONNECTED state. 7.5.1 Initiator Procedure1. The initiator of the Linktest procedure sends theLinktest.req message to the responding entity.2. If the initiator receives a Linktest.rsp within the T6timeout, the Linktest is successfully completed.3. If the T6 timeout expires in the initiator beforereceipt of a Linktest.rsp, it is considered acommunications failure (see SpecialConsiderations).7.5.2 Responding Entity Procedure1. The responding entity receives the Linktest.reqfrom the initiator.2. The responding entity sends a Linktest.rsp.7.6 Separate Procedure  The Separate procedure isused to abruptly terminate HSMS communication foran entity prior to breaking the TCP/IP Connection.HSMS requires that the connection be in theSELECTED state when using Separate. The respondingentity does not send a response and is required toterminate communications regardless of its local state.The procedure is as follows. 7.6.1 Initiator Procedure1. The initiator of the select procedure sends theSeparate.req message to the responding entity. Theinitiator's Separate procedure completessuccessfully. The NOT SELECTED state is entered(see Section 5). 7.6.2 Responding Entity Procedure1. The responding entity receives the Separate.reqfrom the initiator.2. If the responding entity is in the SELECTED state,its Separate procedure completes successfully.3. If the responding entity is not in the SELECTEDstate, the Separate.req is ignored. 7.7 Reject Procedure  The Reject procedure is usedin response to an otherwise valid HSMS messagereceived in an inappropriate context. Supporting thereject procedure can provide useful diagnosticinformation during the development of a distributedapplication using HSMS. The procedure is as follows: 7.7.1 Initiator (Sender of Inappropriate Message)Procedure1. The initiator of the inappropriate message, uponreceiving the Reject.req, takes appropriate action(local entity-specific).7.7.2 Responding Entity Procedure1. The entity receiving the inappropriate messageresponds with a Reject.req message.HSMS requires the reject procedure for the receipt of adata message in the NOT SELECTED state, or thereceipt of a message whose SType or PType (see nextsection: Message Format) is not defined for the entityreceiving the message. Subsidiary standards may defineother conditions which require the Reject Procedure. Ingeneral, receipt of a reject message is an indication ofan improperly configured system or a softwareprogramming error. 8 HSMS Message FormatThis section defines the detailed format of the messagesused by the procedures in the previous section.

SEMI E37-0303 © SEM 1995, 20039 8.1 General Message Format8.1.1 Byte Structure  Within HSMS, a byte containseight (8) bits. The bits in a byte are numbered from Bit7 (most significant) to Bit 0 (least significant).8.1.2 Message Format  An HSMS Message istransmitted as a single contiguous stream of bytes in thefollowing order:Table 2 HSMS Message Format Numberof Bytes Description4 Bytes Message Length. MSB First. Specifies thenumber of bytes in the Message Header plus theMessage Text.10 Bytes Message Header.0n Bytes Message Text. Format is further specified byPType field of message header. 8.1.3 Message Length  Message Length is a four-byte unsigned integer value which specifies the lengthin bytes of the Message Header plus the Message Text.Message Length is transmitted most significant byte(MSB) first and least significant byte (LSB) last.The minimum possible Message Length is 10 (Headeronly). The maximum possible Message Length isimplementation-specific.8.1.4 Message Header  The Message Header is a ten-byte field. The bytes in the header are numbered frombyte 0 (first byte transmitted) to byte 9 (last bytetransmitted). The format of the Message Header is asfollows:Table 3 HSMS Message Header Bytes Description01 Session ID (Device ID)2 Header Byte 23 Header Byte 34 PType5 SType69 System Bytes The physical byte order is designed to correspond asclosely as possible to the SECS-I header. 8.1.4.1 Session ID  Session ID is a 16-bit unsignedinteger value, which occupies bytes 0 and 1 of theheader (byte 0 is MSB, 1 is LSB). Its purpose is toprovide an association by reference between controlmessages (particularly Select and Deselect) andsubsequent data messages. It is the role of HSMSsubsidiary standards to specify this association further.8.1.4.2 Header Byte 2  This header byte is used indifferent ways for different HSMS messages. ForControl Messages (see SType, below) it contains zeroor a status code. For a Data Message whose PType (seebelow) = 0, it contains the W-Bit and SECS Stream.For a Data Message with PType not equal to 0, seeSpecial Considerations.8.1.4.3 Header Byte 3  This header byte is used indifferent ways for different HSMS messages. ForControl Messages, it contains zero or a status code. Fora Data Message whose PType (see below) = 0, itcontains the SECS Function. For a Data Message withPType not equal to 0, see Special Considerations.8.1.4.4 PType  PType (Presentation Type) is an 8-bitunsigned integer value which occupies byte 4 of theheader. PType is intended as an enumerated typedefining the presentation layer message type: how theMessage Header and Message Text are encoded. OnlyPType = 0 is defined by HSMS to mean SECS-IImessage encoding. For non-zero PType values, seeSpecial Considerations.Table 4 PTypeValue Description0 SECS-II Encoding1127 Reserved for subsidiary standards128255 Reserved, not used 8.1.4.5 SType  SType (Session Type) is a one-byteunsigned integer value which occupies header byte 5.SType is an enumerated type identifying whether thismessage is an HSMS Data Message (value = 0) or oneof the HSMS Control Messages (other). Those valuesnot explicitly defined in the table are addressed inSpecial Considerations.

System Bytes is used toidentify a transaction uniquely among the set of open transactions.Uniqueness  The System Bytes of a Primary Data Message, Select.req, Deselect.req, or Linktest.req message mustbe unique from those of all other currently open transactions initiated from the same end of the connection. Theymust also be unique from those of the most recently completed transaction.Reply Message  The System Bytes of a Reply Data Message must be the same as those of the correspondingPrimary Message. The System Bytes of a Select.rsp, Deselect.rsp, or Linktest.rsp must be the same as those of therespective .req message.8.2 HSMS Message Formats by Type  The specific interpretation of the header bytes in an HSMS message isdependent on the specific HSMS message type as defined by the value of the SType field.

Themessage format is as follows:HSMS Message Length is always 10 (the length of theheader alone) or greater.The HSMS Message Header is as follows:Session ID  As described above. Specific valuesubject to subsidiary standards.Header Byte 2  For messages with PType value =0 (SECS-II), header byte 2 is formatted as shownbelow.7 6 0W-Bit Stream The most significant bit (bit 7) of Header Byte 2 isthe W-Bit. In a Primary Message, the W-Bitindicates whether the Primary Message expects aReply message. A Primary Message which expectsa Reply should set the W-Bit to 1. A PrimaryMessage which does not expect a Reply should setthe W-Bit to 0. A Reply Message should always setthe W-Bit to 0. The low-order 7 bits (bits 6-0) ofHeader Byte 2 contain the SECS Stream for themessage. The Stream is a 7-bit unsigned integervalue, which identifies a major topic of themessage, and its use is defined within SEMI E5(SECS-II).Header Byte 3  For messages whose PTypevalue=0, header Byte 3 contains the SECSFunction for the message. The Function is an 8-bitunsigned integer value which identifies a minortopic of the message (within the Stream), and itsuse is defined within SEMI E5 (SECS-II). Theleast significant bit (bit 0) of the Function defineswhether the Data Message is Primary or Reply; thevalue 1 indicates Primary and the value 0 indicatesReply.PType  Set PType = 0 for SECS-II messages.SType = 0System Bytes  For PType=0 (SECS-II), thefollowing definition applies. For a PrimaryMessage, System Bytes contain a value uniquelyidentifying this transaction from all other opentransactions initiated from the same end of theConnection. For a Reply Message, System Bytescontain the same value as the correspondingPrimary Message.The HSMS Message Text contains the text of the DataMessage (if any), formatted as specified by the PType field. For PType = 0, the text will be formatted asSECS-II messages.NOTE 4: Some Data Messages consist of header only, withno text.8.2.2 SType=1: Select.req  An HSMS message withSType 1 is a Select Request Control Message, whichis used by the initiator of the procedure for establishingHSMS communications.

With the exception ofthe SType value, it is identical to the Deselect.reqmessage. Its purpose is to end HSMS communications immediately and without exception. No response isdefined. 9 Special Considerations9.1 General Considerations9.1.1 Communications Failures  If acommunications failure is detected, the entity shouldterminate the TCP/IP connection. Upon termination ofthe connection, the entity may, at this point, attempt toreestablish communications.9.2 TCP/IP Considerations9.2.1 Connect Separation Time (T5)  The connectprocedures initiate some network activity. Frequent useof the active mode connect procedure to the IP Addressand Port Number of an entity not yet ready to acceptconnections can be hostile to TCP/IP operations. Thepassive mode does not generate network activity and isnot considered hostile to the network, although it mayaffect local application performance. An Entityinitiating a connection in the active mode should limitits use of the connect procedure in a manner that isequivalent to the procedure described here.After an active connect procedure terminates by anymeans (successfully or unsuccessfully), the Entityshould not initiate another active connect procedure (forthe same Remote Entity) until the T5 ConnectSeparation Time has elapsed. The separation of connectoperations will be the sum of the T5 ConnectSeparation Time interval, plus the duration of theconnect operation itself.9.2.2 NOT SELECTED Timeout (T7)  Entry into theNOT SELECTED state is achieved either by statetransition #2 (establishment of a TCP/IP connection).There is a time limit on how long an entity is requiredto remain in the NOT SELECTED state before eitherentering the SELECTED state or by returning to theNOT CONNECTED state.Some entities, particularly those unable to accept morethan a single TCP/IP connection, may be impaired intheir operation by remaining in their NOT SELECTEDstate as they will be unavailable for communicationswith other entities. Such entities shall disconnect theTCP/IP connection (State Transition Event #3) ifcommunication remains in the NOT SELECTED statefor longer than the T7 timeout period.9.2.3 Network Intercharacter Timeout (T8)  BecauseTCP/IP is a stream rather than a message protocol, it ispossible that bytes which are all part of a single HSMSmessage may be transmitted in separate TCP/IPmessages without any violation of the TCP/IP protocol.Since it is possible that these separate messages may be

&lt;!-- Page 42 --&gt;

SEMI E37-0303 © SEMI 1995, 2003 14 separated by a substantial period of time, the NetworkIntercharacter Timeout (T8) is defined.T8 is similar in purpose to the SECS-I T1 timer exceptthat the communications issues which necessitate T8are not entirely in the control of the sender of themessage. Therefore, it is defined only in terms of thereceiver of the message. In particular, if after receipt ofa partial message, the T8 timeout period expires prior toreceipt of the complete message, the receiving entityshall consider such case as a communications failure, asdefined above.9.2.4 Multiple Connection Requests Directed to aSingle Published Port  Once a passive entity hasaccepted a connection on its published port, TCP/IPpermits (though does not require) the entity to listen forand accept additional connections directed to the samepublished port.HSMS permits (though does not require) entities tooperate in this manner. However, for the purposes ofHSMS compliance, each connection so formed mustexhibit the behavior defined in the HSMS state diagramas if it were completely independent of any otherconnection to the same published port.9.2.4.1 Rejection of Additional Connection Requests bya Passive Mode Entity  A passive mode entity unableto service more than a single TCP/IP connection forHSMS communications will follow one of these threeprocedures with respect to additional connectionrequests.a. Accept the connection, but always respond to anysubsequent HSMS select procedures with theCommunication Already Active response code. Forthe purpose of the HSMS State Diagram, theconnect procedure terminates successfully (entersCONNECTED state), but HSMS communicationsare never established (remain in NOT SELECTEDsubstate). This is the preferred option in that it canprovide the most information to the remote entityas to why the connection is refused (see HSMSSelect Procedure), but places an additionimplementation requirement on the local entity.b. Actively reject the connection request. This can bedone in a TLI implementation using the t\_snddisprocedure. This will cause the connect procedure inthe remote entity to terminate unsuccessfully. Thisoption may not be available to all implementationsbecause some APIs, notably someimplementations of BSD Sockets, do not providefor initiating an active reject. Note, however, thatall TCP/IP implementations, including BSDSockets, properly respond to an active reject fromthe remote entity. c. Refuse to listen for or accept the connect request.No action is taken in the local entity: the remoteentitys connect procedure will eventually time out.This option is permitted, but not recommended, asit can cause considerable delay on the part of theremote entity. However, it may be the onlyalternative available to implementations withnetwork resource limitations.The documentation of the passive local entity shallindicate which means it uses to refuse connections.9.3 HSMS-Specific Considerations9.3.1 Control Transactions T6 Control Timeout  Anumber of the control messages are part of procedureswhich require a message exchange or transaction:.req from the initiator of the control service,followed by an .rsp from the receiver of the.req in response to it. A control transaction isconsidered open from the time the .req request issent until the time the .rsp is received.The time a control transaction may remain open issubject to the T6 control transaction timeout. Uponinitiation of a control transaction, the local entity shouldset a timer whose duration is equal to the T6 timeoutvalue. If the transaction is properly closed prior to theexpiration of the timer, the timer should be canceled. Ifthe timer expires prior to the proper closing of thetransaction, the transaction shall be considered closedby the initiator and considered an HSMScommunications failure.9.3.2 Procedures and Stateless Transactions Most of the HSMS control procedures involve atransaction: the initiator sends a request message to theresponding entity and waits for a response message.The responding entity receives the initiator's requestmessage and sends a reply.Note that such transactions are stateless in thefollowing sense: while the initiator of a transaction iswaiting for a response, it may receive a message otherthan that response, and this message may be anymessage valid for the state the initiator was in at thetime the original transaction was initiated. For example,the two entities may simultaneously initiatetransactions. As a result, no states forTRANSACTION OPEN or TRANSACTION NOTOPEN are reflected in the HSMS state machine. Theuse of such state information in an implementation isstrictly a local entity-specific issue.9.3.3 Alternative Message Types and Header ByteValues  The HSMS standard does not completelydefine all possible enumerated values of either thePType or SType field. Further, Header bytes 2 and 3have a format determined by the PType for messages

&lt;!-- Page 43 --&gt;

SEMI E37-0303 © SEM 1995, 200315 whose SType is equal to 0, but is otherwise specifiedfor all other SType values. The message text formattingis defined by the PType as well, but only for datamessages.Subsidiary standards must be consistent with thisconvention. In particular, for SType = 0, subsidiarystandards defining PType values not equal to 0 mayspecify both the message text encoding and theinterpretation of header bytes 2 and 3. For STypes notequal to 0 but otherwise specified in this standard,PType must = 0, and no message text may betransmitted. For STypes defined in subsidiarystandards, the meaning of header bytes 2 and 3 may bespecified on a per SType value basis, and these STypesmay optionally define message text as long as thePType field is used in a manner consistent with thepreceding paragraph.9.4 SECS-II Considerations  The SECS-II standard(SEMI E5) makes certain references to SECS-I (SEMIE4). This section addresses issues specific to SECS-IIwhen HSMS is used to transport SECS-II messages.9.4.1 Reply Matching  When a Sender sends aPrimary Message with W-Bit 1 (Reply Expected), theSender should expect a Reply message whose headermeets the following requirements.The SessionID of the Reply must match theSessionID of the Primary Message.The Stream of the Reply must match the Stream ofthe Primary Message.The Function of the Reply must be one greater thanthe Function of the Primary Message, or else theFunction of the Reply must be 0 (Function ZeroReply).The System Bytes of the Reply must match theSystem Bytes of the Primary Message.9.4.1.1 T3 Reply Timeout  The T3 reply timeout is alimit on the length of time that the HSMS messageprotocol is willing to wait for a Reply message. After sending a Primary Message with W-bit 1 (ReplyExpected), the sender must begin a reply timer,initialized to the T3 value. If the sender does notreceive the Reply Message before the reply timerexpires, then a T3 Timeout Error has occurred. Thesender should close the transaction and no longerexpect the Reply Message.Each open transaction for which a Reply is expectedrequires a separate reply timer.9.4.2 Stream 9 Messages  The SECS-II standarddefines error messages S9F1, S9F3, S9F5, S9F7, S9F9,and S9F11, with message text containing the SECS-IIData Items MHEAD or SHEAD, which are defined tocontain a 10-byte SECS-I block header.When using SECS-II with HSMS, MHEAD andSHEAD should contain the ten bytes of the HSMSMessage Header. 10 HSMS DocumentationAn HSMS implementation is required to document thefollowing information:1. Method for setting protocol parameters (seeSection 10.1).2. Range allowed and resolution for each parameter.3. The option used for refusing incoming connectionrequests if the implementation uses the passivemode for TCP/IP connection establishment.4. Maximum message size which can be received.5. Maximum expected size of messages sent.6. Maximum number of supported concurrent opentransactions.10.1 Parameter Setting  Implementations of HSMSmust provide for installation time setting of thefollowing parameters. The range and resolution of allparameters must be at least as shown in the table. Allparameters must be stored in such a manner that thesettings will be retained if the power fails or if thesystem software is reloaded.

Note that the data message activity for TCP is for illustrative purposesonly. In fact, the actual network activity can vary. For example, even if the data messages are sent as separate callsto t\_snd (or write) as shown, the TCP/IP implementation may buffer the header and transmit it in a single packetwith the text, or the text may be split into multiple packets.Table 5BSD API Calls TLI API Calls Network Activity TLI API Calls BSD API CallsPrepare to initiate a connection request.

SEMI E37-0303 © SEM 1995, 200319 A1-3 HSMS Alternating Mode ConnectProcedureSome users have particular requirements which preventthem from determining which connect mode (active orpassive) a given entity will use at any particular time. Insuch a case, a Local Entity alternately attempts theactive mode and passive mode connect procedure untila connection is successfully established. Note that thisrequires that local entity provide a published port whenin the passive phase. The general logic sequence at theAlternating Local Entity is as follows:1. Attempt an active connect procedure as describedin Section 6.3.3 using a timeout value for thet\_rcvconnect greater than or equal to theconnection separation timeout T5.2. If the active connect procedure completessuccessfully, the alternating mode connectprocedure completes successfully.3. If the active connect procedure terminatesunsuccessfully, attempt the passive connectprocedure as described in 6.3.2 with the timeout forthe t\_listen greater than or equal to the connectionseparation timeout T5.4. If the passive connect procedure completessuccessfully, the alternating mode connectprocedure completes successfully as described in6.3.2.5. If the passive connect procedure terminatesunsuccessfully, the local entity may either return tostep 1 to continue the alternating mode procedureor terminate unsuccessfully. The number of timesthe above sequence of steps are repeated inattempting to form a connection is a local entity-specific issue.A1-3.1 Alternating Mode Cycle Time  TheAlternating Mode Cycle Time is the time betweeniterations of the Connect Procedure of an AlternatingMode entity. In the above procedure, this correspondsto the duration between the initiation of step 1 andcompletion of step 5 immediately prior to thereinitiation of step 1. This time is implementation-dependent.In the case that two entities are both using theAlternating Mode Connect Procedure, it is desirable toensure that they both have different alternating modecycle times, to prevent the entities from attempting toconnect in lock step: both in active mode, then both inpassive mode. Adjusting the Alternating Mode CycleTime can be readily achieved by adjustment of T5 sothat the cycle time is different for the two entities: A1-3.2 HSMS Connect Combinations  An entityconfigured as alternating between active and passivemode can connect with either an passive or active moderemote entity. The list below summarizes thecombinations possible using the standard with thisparticular connections strategy.1. An Entity A configured as ACTIVE can connectto an Entity B configured as PASSIVE or asALTERNATING, and Entity A always establishesthe Connection.2. An Entity A configured as ALTERNATING canconnect to an Entity B configured as PASSIVE,and Entity A always establishes the Connection.3. An Entity A configured as ALTERNATING canconnect to an Entity B configured asALTERNATING, and either end can establish theConnection. In implementations which use multi-threaded connect logic, rather than the sequentiallogic described in this document, it may bepossible that both ends of the HSMS connectionattempt to connect at the same time. In this case,there can be two separate TCP/IP connectionsestablished, and it is necessary to establish aconvention so that one connection is allowed toremain and the other is terminated.4. It is not allowed to connect two Entities bothconfigured as PASSIVE, or both configured asACTIVE.A1-4 Non-HSMS TCP/IP ProtocolsFor typical TCP/IP implementations, HSMS can co-exist with other TCP/IP based protocols on the same IPAddress. This can be very useful. For example, aSECS-II message transaction could trigger anapplication to begin a TCP/IP FTP (File TransferProtocol) sequence to transfer a large data file.A1-5 Non-TCP/IP ProtocolsThe use of protocols other than TCP/IP on the samenetwork as the HSMS entities is possible but beyondthe scope of this standard. Typically, other protocolscould be used, provided they have no impact on TCP/IPor HSMS entities on the network.A1-6 Multiple LANsThe HSMS specification considers only a singleTCP/IP LAN. Interconnecting multiple LANs is outsidethe scope of HSMS. However, since TCP/IPimplementations typically support such configurationsseamlessly through gateways, routers, and similarentities, it may be possible to establish an HSMSConnection across interconnected LANs.

SEMI E37-0303 © SEMI 1995, 2003 20 A1-7 TCP/IP Physical LayerHSMS does not specify the physical layer of IP. Anyphysical layer supported by TCP/IP can be used. Mostcommonly, TCP/IP implementations use Ethernet(IEEE 802.3) as the physical layer. However, someTCP/IP implementations use other protocols (e.g.,Token Bus, IEEE 802.4 and .5). To ensureinteroperability within a given installation, it may bedesirable to establish additional local standards for thephysical layer.A1-8 Well-Known TCP/IP Port NumbersSome TCP/IP-based protocols specify a particularWell Known TCP Port Number, which is publishedand is not available for other protocols. HSMS does notspecify a particular Well Known TCP Port Number,but instead requires that it be configurable. The IETFdefines Assigned Well Known Port Numbers in RFC1340.A1-9 Delay between Disconnect and Re-ConnectSome TCP/IP systems exhibit problems withapplications which terminate a connection and thenquickly re-connect, when using identical TCP ports onboth ends of the connection. When using such systems,it may be advisable to delay after disconnect before re-connecting. The delay time varies among TCP/IPimplementations, but typically can be calculated astwice the Maximum Segment Lifetime or MSL. Forexample, most TCP/IP systems based on BSD (e.g.,Sun, AIX) use a MSL of 30 seconds, so a delay of 60 seconds would be appropriate. If rapid connects arerequired, your application should use a different Port, ifallowed by the Connect Mode you are using. In someTCP/IP systems, this problem does not occur.A1-10 User-Defined Message TypesIt is recognized that equipment suppliers may find itdesirable to develop additional features not found in thebase level HSMS or any defined subsidiary standards.This will be the case during the testing anddevelopment of any proposed new subsidiary standard.User-defined extensions through new message types arepermissible as long as they are confined to intra-vendorcommunication interfaces: any inter-vendorcommunications interface which requires the use ofsuch extensions is considered to be noncompliant withthe HSMS standard.If a supplier does deem it necessary to extend orotherwise go outside the standard, the use of reserved,not used, values of PType and SType may simplifytheir implementation by permitting the reuse of theHSMS implementation rather than the implementationand use of a completely separate parallel standard. Byremaining within the reserved, not used, ranges forSType and PType, the implementor can be assured thatfuture subsidiary standards which define new values forSType and/or PType will not conflict with user-definedextensions.A1-11 Comparison of SECS-I and HSMSThe following table compares major features of SECS-Iand HSMS. Feature SECS-I HSMSCommunications ProtocolBaseRS-232 TCP/IP Physical Layer 25-pin connector and 4-wire serial cable Physical layer not defined. HSMS allows anyTCP/IP supported physical medium. Typicalexample is Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) and thin coax (10-BASE-2).Communications Speed Typically about 1000 bytes/second (assuming9600 baud).Typically 10 MBits/second (assuming typicalEthernet).Connections One physical RS-232 cable per SECS-Iconnection.One physical network cable can support manyHSMS Connections.Message Format Message text is SECS-II Data Items. Transmits a SECS-II message as a series oftransmittal blocks each approximately 256bytes in size. Each block has a one-byte blocklength, a ten-byte Block Header, text, and atwo-byte Checksum. Message Text is SECS-II Data Items. Transmits a SECS-II message as a TCP/IP bytestream. The message has a four-byte MessageLength, a ten-byte Message Header, and text. TheTCP/IP layer may impose blocking limits whichdepend on the physical layer used, but this blockingis transparent to the TCP/IP API and is outside thescope of HSMS.

The purpose ofthis standard is to explicitly limit the capabilities of theHSMS Generic Services to the minimum necessary forthis type of application. Specifically, HSMS imposesthe following limitations:1. HSMS-SS eliminates the use of a number of HSMSprocedures. Deselect is not to be used to end HSMS-SS communications (use Separate instead), and theReject procedure is optional.2. HSMS-SS limits certain other procedures such asSelect to simplify operation for the specific case ofSECS-I replacement. 5.2 The remainder of this document describes theselimitations in more detail.5.3 HSMS-SS State Machine  The HSMS-SSbehavior and state machine differ from that specified inthe HSMS Generic Services in the following ways:1. The SelectionCounter defined in HSMS GenericServices is not required.2. Various transitions are defined differently asillustrated in the HSMS-SS state machine illustratedbelow.
