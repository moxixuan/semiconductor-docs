DETERMINATION OF TOTAL NORMALITY FOR ALKALINE
DEVELOPER SOLUTIONS
1  Scope
1. 1   An  acid-base  potentiometric  ti tration  to  single  or
multiple inflection points is performed on an automatic
recording  titrator  using  standardized  hydrochloric  acid
as   the   titrant.   The   normality   (meq/mL)   is   then
calculated by the titrator using the data obtained.
2  Apparatus
2. 1  Autotitrator
2. 2  Glass combination electrode
2. 3   Class  A  grade  volumetric  pipe ts  in  1  to  25  mL
sizes
2. 4  250 mL beakers
3  Reagents
3. 1   1.0  N  Hydrochloric  acid  (from   concentrate  or
ready to use 1.0 N)
3. 2     Primary    Standard    —    High-pu rity    sodium
carbonate   is   available   from   most   chemical   supply
houses,  but  must  be  dried  at  400  degree  centigrade
before       use.       TMAH       (tris       (hydroxymethyl)
aminomethane)   is   also   available   from   the   National
Institute    of    Standards    and    Technology    (Standard
Reference Material 723a) for this purpose.
3. 3  Buffer solutions, pH 4.0, 7.0, 1 0.0.
4  Procedure
4. 1   Standardize  the  1.0  N  Hydroch loric  acid  with  the
primary standard.
4. 2  Standardize the titrator by perf orming a two point
calibration with pH 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0 buffer.
4. 3   Pipette  an  appropriate  aliquot   (1  to  25  mL)  of
sample into a 250 mL beaker containing a magnetic stir
bar. Sample size should be determined according to the
expected  normality  and  the  amount  of  titrant  to  be
dispensed  that  will  give  the  optimum  precision  and
accuracy. Generally this is between one-half and three-
quarters the capacity of the burette. (See the instrument
manual for the recommended optimum range.)
4. 4    Add   deionized   water   to   bring   t he   volume   to
approximately 150 mL.
4. 5     Without    delay    (to    prevent    carb on    dioxide
absorption),  begin  stirring  without  a  vortex  and  titrate
to beyond the inflection endpoint.
4. 6    Determine   the   exact   endpoint    and   record   the
volume   of   titrant   consumed   at   the   middle   of   the
inflection endpoint. This will be done automatically on
most  newer  digital  titrators.  On  analog  titrators,  the
inflection  point  can  be  determined  by  using  the  first
derivative  mode,  or  accurately  determining  the  middle
of the inflection.
5  Calculation
5. 1   Calculate  the  normality  of  the   sample  by  the
following equation.
Normality (N) =
Volume of titrant (mL)×Normality of titrant (N.HCL)
Sample Volume (mL)

DETERMINATION OF IRON, ZINC, CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, COPPER,
BORON, ALUMINUM, CHROMIUM, MANGANESE, AND NICKEL IN
POSITIVE PHOTORESISTS BY INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA
EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY (ICP)
1  Scope
1. 1  This procedure is an ICP plasm a emission analysis
for  determination  of  iron,  zinc,  calcium,  magnesium,
copper,  boron,  aluminum,  chromium,  manganese,  and
nickel   in   photoresist.   The   applicable   concentration
range is 0.1 to 1 ppm when the sample is diluted 1 to 4.
The  precision  was  found  to  be  within  0.1  ppm  in  a
round robin analysis between four laboratories.
2  Spectrometer
2. 1   A  grating  instrument  with  reso lution  sufficient  to
separate  the  analytical  emission  lines  in  Table  1  is
required.

3  Sample Preparation
3. 1  The sample is diluted 1/4 (1 pa rt of sample plus 3
parts of solvent weight/weight) in 2-methoxyethanol or
another  suitable  solvent  for  positive  resist.  The  solvent
should   contain   less   than   0.03   ppm   of   the   above
elements.
4  Standards
4. 1   The  standards  should  be  weigh t/weight  (mg/kg)
and  should  be  diluted  weight/weight  since  results  will
be expressed in mg/kg.
4. 2     The    standards    are    prepared    by     diluting    a
concentrated  standard  of  organic-soluble  metals  in  2-
methoxyethanol or other suitable solvent. For example,
a  500  ppm  standard  is  diluted  to  50  ppm  with  xylene.
This  solution  is  then  diluted  to  0.25  ppm  with  2-
methoxythanol.
5  Plasma Conditions
5. 1   The  sample  is  pumped  on  the  r egion  of  0.7
mL/min,  usually  with  a  perstaltic  pump  attached  to  the
nebulizer.  Choose  a  tubing  that  is  not  attacked  by
methyl    cellosolve    (for    example,    polytetrafluoro-
ethylene).  The  argon  plasma  flow  rate  and  RF  power
should   be   optimized   for   the   sample   using   settings
recommended in the manufacturer’s manual. Generally,
a  plasma  gas  flow  rate  of  16  1/min.  is  necessary  to
ionize  organic  solutions  and  an  RF  power  of  1.7  watts
is required.
6  Quantitation
6. 1  The detector gain is set by mea suring the 0.25 ppm
standard. The background is measured with the solvent
and  several  sample  measures.  The  standard  and  blank
should   be   run   intermittently   to   satisfy   reasonable
precision.  Standard  and  sample  readings  should  be
repeatable   within   0.03   ppm.   The   effect   of   sample
viscosity on delivery of diluted resist to the plasma was
not  found  to  be  a  factor  for  the  resist  tested  for  this
procedure.  This  effect  can  be  checked  by  adding  an
internal standard of an element known not to be present
in the resist (such as Yttrium) at ppm and checking the
emission response vs. external 1 ppm Yttrium standard
in the diluting solvent.

7. 2    Detection   Limit   —   The   detecti on   limit   is   a
function   of   the   dilution   factor   and   can   vary   by
instrument.  The  dilution  factor  should  be  taken  into
account in calculation of detection limit.
7. 2.1  Detection limit (ppm) = s × dil ution factor where

DETERMINATION OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM IN POSITIVE
PHOTORESISTS BY ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY
This  standard  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Micropatterning  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Micropatterning  Committee.    Current  edition  approved  by  the  North
American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  July  11,  2004.    Initially  available  at  www.semi.org  September
2004; to be published November 2004.  Originally published in 1991.
1  Scope
1. 1  This   procedure   is   a   flame   atomic   absorption
analytical method for sodium and potassium analysis in
photoresist. The applicable concentration range is 0.1 to
1  ppm  when  the  sample  is  diluted  one  to  four.  The
precision  was  found  to  be  within  0.1  ppm  in  a  round-
robin analysis between four laboratories.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.
2  Referenced Standards
2. 1  None.
3  Terminology
3. 1.1  Detection   Limit   —   the   detection   limit   is   a
function   of   the   dilution   factor   and   can   vary   by
instrument.  The  dilution  factor  should  be  taken  into
account in calculation of detection limit.
4  Atomic Absorption Spectrometer
4. 1  The  analytical  wavelength  for  sodium  is  589.0  nm
and   for   potassium   is   766.0   nm.   The   instrument
conditions (i.e., slit width, burner gas flow rates) should
be set according to the manufacturer’s manual (the fuel
flow  should  be  set  to  approximately  1/2  the  air  flow  to
optimize  for  organic  solvent).  Optimize  the  nebulizer
and lamp alignment to maximize the absorbance of the
1 ppm standard.
5  Sample Preparation
5. 1  The sample should be diluted 1/4 (1 part resist and
3 parts of solvents weight/weight) in 2-methoxyethanol
or   another   suitable   solvent   for   positive   resist.   The
solvent should contain less than 0.1 ppm of the element
being analyzed.
6  Standards
6. 1  The  standards  should  be  weight/weight  (mg/kg)
and  should  be  diluted  weight/weight  since  results  will
be expressed in mg/kg.
6. 2  The    standards    are    prepared    by    diluting    a
concentrated   stock   of   organic-soluble   sodium   and
potassium. For example, a 500 ppm standard of sodium
is diluted to 50 ppm with reagent xylene. This solution
is  then  diluted  to  1  ppm  with  2-methoxyethanol  or
another suitable solvent.
7  Procedure
7. 1  Set  the  absorbance  reading  to  zero  with  the  flame
ignited    and    no    sample    aspirating.    Measure    the
absorbance  of  the  solvent  blank.  It  should  not  be  more
than   0.04.   Measure   the   absorbance   of   the   1   ppm
standard  and  samples.  The  absorbance  of  the  standard
should  be  in  the  region  of  0.4.  Duplicate  sample  and
standard  readings  should  be  within  0.01  absorbance.  A
recovery   of   88%   was   determined   when   a   1   ppm
potassium  internal  standard  was  added  to  the  resist
tested. The effect of viscosity on delivery to the burner
can  be  determined  by  adding  2  ppm  of  a  potassium
internal   standard   to   the   sample   and   checking   the
absorbance   versus   an   external   2   ppm   potassium
standard in the diluting solvent. The potassium level in
the resist, if any, should be subtracted.
8  Calculation

Abs. Sample×ppm Standard×dilution factor×R
Abs. Standard

R   =   Recovery   factor   due   to   sample   viscosity   if
applicable, for example 1.136 in above example.
Detection  limit  (ppm)  =  s  ×  dilution  factor  where  s  =
standard deviation of instrument “readings” in ppm.

4  Instrument Conditions
4. 1  Atomic  Absorption  Spectrometer  —  The  analytical
wavelength  for  sodium  is  589  nm  and  for  potassium  is
766  nm.    The  instrument  conditions  (i.e.,  slit  width,
burner  gas  flow  rates)  should  be  set  according  to  the
manufacturer’s  manual.    Optimize  the  nebulizer  and
lamp  alignment  to  maximize  the  absorbance  of  the  1
ppm standard.
5  Standards
5. 1  The  standards  should  be  weight/weight  (mg/kg)
and  should  be  diluted  weight/weight  since  results  will
be expressed in mg/kg.
5. 2  The    standards    are    prepared    by    diluting    a
concentrated stock. For example, a 500 ppm standard of
sodium is diluted to 50 ppm with de-ionized water. This
solution is then diluted to 1 ppm.
6  Procedure
6. 1  No sample preparation nor dilution is required.
6. 2  Set  the  absorbance  reading  to  zero  with  the  flame
ignited    and    no    sample    aspirating.    Measure    the
absorbance  of  the  1  ppm  standards  and  samples.  The
absorbance of the standard should be in the range of 0.2
absorbance.  Duplicate  sample  and  standard  readings
should   be   within   0.01   absorbance.   The   effect   of
viscosity  on  delivery  to  the  burner  can  be  determined
by adding 2 ppm of a potassium internal standard to the
sample and checking the absorbance versus an external
2  ppm  potassium  standard.  The  potassium  level  in  the
developer, if any, should be subtracted.

3  Standards
The  standards  should  be  weight/weight  (mg/kg)  and
should  be  diluted  weight/weight  since  results  will  be
expressed in mg/kg.
The standards are prepared by diluting a concentrated
standard. For example, a 500 ppm standard is diluted to
50 ppm with deionized water. This solution is then
diluted to 0.25 ppm.
4  Plasma Conditions
The  sample  is  pumped  in  the  region  of  0.7  mL/min.
usually   with   a   peristaltic   pump   attached   to   the
nebulizer.  The  argon  plasma  flow  rate  and  RF  power
should   be   optimized   for   the   sample   using   settings
recommended in the manufacturer manual. Generally, a
plasma  gas  flow  rate  of  12  L/min  and  an  RF  power  of
1. 25 kW is required.
5  Quantitation
No sample preparation nor dilution is required.
The  detector  gain  is  set  by  measuring  the  0.25  ppm
standard.  The  standard  should  be  run  intermittently  to
satisfy   reasonable   precision.   Standard   and   sample
readings  should  be  repeatable  within  0.03  ppm.  The
effect of sample viscosity on delivery of diluted sample
to  the  plasma  was  not  found  to  be  a  factor  for  this
procedure.  This  effect  can  be  checked  by  adding  an
internal standard of an element known not to be present
in the sample (such as Yttrium) at 1 ppm and checking
the  emission  response  vs.  an  external  1  ppm  Yttrium
standard.
6  Calculation

×0.25 ppm
Where Ιx = emission intensity of sample
Ιs = emission intensity of 0.25 ppm standard

STEPPERS
This  specification  was  technically  reapproved  by  the  Global  Micropatterning  Committee  and  is  the  direct
responsibility  of  the  North  American  Microlithography  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  North

September 2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published in 1992.
1  Scope
1. 1  Definitions  for  the  overlay  capabilities  of  wafer
steppers  are  established,  consistent  with  the  primary
application  of  wafer  stepper  (i.e.,  the  manufacturing  of
very  large-scale  integrated  circuits).  Also  included  are
definitions   for   associated   parameters:   registration,
exposure field, good fields, and alignment.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address
safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior
to use.

2. 1  Statistical  methods  shall  be  used  in  accordance
with    the    procedures    in    NBS    Handbook    #91
(Experimental  Statistics,  by  M.G.  Natrella)  and  ASTM
STD  15D  (Manual  on  the  presentation  of  data  and
control chart analysis).
NOTICE:  Unless  otherwise  indicated,  all  documents
cited shall be the latest published versions.
3  Terminology
3. 1  Definitions
3. 1.1  overlay  —  a  vector  quantity  defined  at  every
point on the wafer.  It is the difference,
O
r
, between the
vector  position,
1P
r
,  of  a  substrate  geometry,  and  the
vector  position  of  the  corresponding  point,
2P
r
,  in  an
overlaying pattern, which may consist of photoresist:
O

=1P
r
–2P
r

3. 1.2  interfield  overlay  (also  referred  to  as  field-to-
field overlay) — The center of the lens is chosen to be a
reference  point.  The  overlay  at  the  reference  point  in
each exposure field is the interfield overlay.
3. 1.3  exposure field — the area of a wafer covered by a
single exposure.
3. 1.4  intrafield  overlay  (also  referred  to  as  within-a-
field  overlay)  —  the  overlay  within  an  exposure  field,
relative to the overlay at the center of the lens reference
location.
NOTE 1:  From these definitions, it follows that the overlay at
any  point  on  the  wafer  is  the  vector  sum  of  interfield  and
intrafield overlays.
3. 1.5  registration — a vector quantity defined at every
point on the wafer.  It is the difference,
R
r
, between the
vector position,
1P
r
, of a substrate geometry, and vector
position  of  the  corresponding  point,
0P
r
, in a reference
grid:
R
r
=1P
r
-0P
r

3. 1.5.1  The  reference  grid  must  be  clearly  specified  in
any specification of registration.
3. 1.5.2  Interfield and intrafield registration are defined
in a manner similar to interfield and intrafield overlay.
3. 1.5.3  Overlay  may  be  computed  from  registration
measurements if the same reference standard is used on
all systems for determining registration.
3. 1.6  alignment —   the   mechanical   positioning   of
reference  points  on  the  wafers  (“alignment  targets”)  to
the corresponding points on the reticles. The measure of
alignment  is  the  overlay  at  the  position  on  the  wafer
where the alignment targets are placed.
3. 1.7  Registration    and    overlay    vectors    shall    be
decomposed  into  orthogonal  components,  X  and  Y,
along the directions of the stepper stage motion.
3. 1.8  good   fields   —   exposure   fields   in   which   the
magnitude of the overlay at every point within the field
is  less  than  a  specified  value,  V,  in  both  the  X  and  Y
directions,  exclusive  of  contributions  to  overlay  from
the  reticles  and  non-linear  deformations  of  the  wafers
during non-stepper processing.
NOTE 2:  It  should  be  recognized  that  contributions  from
reticles  are  non-statistical  in  nature,  and  that  a  particular
reticle   will   make   the   same   contributions   to   overlay   and
registration in every exposure field in which it is imaged.


SEMI P18-92 © SEMI 1992, 2004 2
3. 1.9  fraction  of  good  field  —  the  overlay  capabilities
of  wafer  steppers  shall  be  quantified  in  terms  of  the
fraction  of  good  fields,  F,  out  of  the  total  number  of
fields on the wafer:
F=
Number of good fields
Number of total fields

Good  fields  may  also  be  quantified  as  a  percentage
(100 × F%).
3. 1.10  Any  specification  of  overlay  must  define  the
applicable exposure field size and the stepping patterns
on  the  wafers  over  which  the  specification  applies.
From   Sections   3.1.8   and   3.1.9   it   follows   that   the
specification of the overlay capability of wafer steppers
consists of at least two additional numbers, the overlay
value,  V,  and  the  fraction  of  good  fields,  F.  It  is
consistent to characterize stepper overlay capability for
multiple  overlay  values,  V

,  V
2
,  ...  with  corresponding
multiple fractions of good fields, F

SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY PATTERN CELLS FOR
INTEGRATED CIRCUIT MANUFACTURE
Purpose
This  document  defines  several  standard  test  patterns  to
provide  consistent  industrywide  evaluation  and  testing
of  micropatterning  equipment,  metrology  instruments,
and processes used in integrated circuit manufacturing.
1  General Specification
1. 1  Scope
1. 1.1   This  specification  defines  the  s hape,  general
size,  and  recommended  placement  and  design  rules
(where  appropriate)  of  several  basic  pattern  cells  for
linewidth  metrology,  resolution  testing,  and  proximity
testing. These standard patterns include cells that can be
used  for  optical  microscopy,  electron  microscopy,  and
electrical probe testing.
1. 1.2   This  document  does  not  attem pt  to  specify  the
measurement techniques to be used in verifying critical
dimensions   for   these   test   patterns   on   the   reticle.
Similarly,  this  document  does  not  attempt  to  specify
how  the  printed  patterns  are  to  be  measured  on  the
wafer.  This  document  specifies  only  what  the  patterns
are  supposed  to  be;  it  is  left  to  the  user  to  ensure  that
the actual pattern conforms to this specification, subject
to  all  other  applicable  SEMI  specifications.  A  separate
SEMI    document    will    specify    CD    measurement
conditions (see Section 1.2.1).

differing  heights  for  the  same  line  at  the  same  cross-section.
For  this  reason,  substantial  method-dependent  differences  in
measurement  results  may  be  expected  and  it  is  convenient  to
identify   the   method   used   in   expressions   such   as   “SEM
linewidth,”   “optical   linewidth,”   or   “electrical   linewidth”
(ASTM   F   127).   Furthermore,   the   height   at   which   the
measurement  is  taken  shall  be  qualitatively  stated,  even  if  it
cannot be quantitively determined.
feature  —  areas  within  a  single,  continuous  boundary
(for example, an aggregate image) that have an optical-
density  value  (gray-level  range),  that  is  distinct  from
the  background  area  outside  the  feature  (ASTM  D
3849,  D  24)  (e.g.,  the  simplest  element  of  a  pattern,
such as a single line, space, or L-bar).
feature  group  —  a  small  assembly  of  one  or  more
similar  features  arranged  together,  such  as  three  nested
L-bars.
nominal  feature  dimension  —  the  linear  dimension  of
interest, such as the linewidth or contact hole width.
basic  cell  —  an  arrangement  of  features  or  groups,  as
defined   by   this   document,   based   upon   a   specific,
nominal-feature dimension.
composite cell — an arrangement of several basic cells.
