The  consumption  of  InP  wafers  is\nincreasing year by year due to the fiber communication\nsystems such as LAN, ISDN, and others.\nA1-2      In   order   to   fabricate   these   devices,   many\nrectangular wafers with more than 30 different sizes are\nindustrially   used   but   most   of   the   sizes   are   not\nreasonably determined. From the viewpoint of material\nyield   as   explained   below,   the   standardization   of\nrectangular InP wafers is useful not only for InP wafer\nmanufacturers, but also for device manufacturers.\nA1-3    Figure  A1-1  shows  the  effective  area  (A)  as  a\nfunction of ratio of longitudinal length (a) and of lateral\nlength  (b).  It  is  a  fact  that  the  largest  area  can  be\nobtained  when  the  shape  is  square.  However,  it  is\ndifficult to distinguish V-Groove and Dove-Tail Groove\norientations  when  the  shape  is  square.  It  is,  therefore,\nnecessary  to  make  the  shape  rectangular  in  a  way  that\none  can  distinguish  the  orientations.  It  is  however,\nnoted  that  if  the  length  ratio  becomes  too  large,  the\neffective  area  is  dramatically  decreased  as  seen  in\nFigure  A1-1.  For  instance,  rectangular  wafers  at  the\npoint  P  have  very  little  area,  and  most  of  wafer  is  cut\noff in vain. It is, therefore, very reasonable to select the\nlength  ratio  at  which  the  effective  area  is  not  largely\ndecreased.  When  the  length  ratio  (a/b  ratio)  is  \u221a2,  the\narea  decrease  is  only  5.7%  as  seen  in  Table  A1-1  and\nFigure  A1-1.  It  is  also  interesting  to  note  that  if  the\nlength  ratio  is  determined  as  \u221a2,  each  half  of  the\nrectangular  wafer  again  gives  a  similar  shape  with  the\nsame  ratio.  In  fact,  this  length  ratio  is  used  for  paper\nstandardization as A3/A4 or B3/B4. Rectangular wafers\nare therefore determined SEMI M23.3.\nA1-4    Since  there  are  already  standardized  50  mm  and\n75  mm  round  wafers,  the  standardization  is  made  in  a\nway that large rectangular wafers can be obtained from\nthese  standardized  wafers  by  removing  5  mm  from  the\nperiphery as seen in Figure A1-2. Removing of 5 mm is\ndue to EPD measurement specifications in which 5 mm\nperiphery is excluded from the measurement.\nA1-5  As explained above, it is highly recommended to\nuse  the  standardized  rectangular  wafers  because  this\nstandardization    is    very    important    in    preventing\nproliferation  of  various  sizes  of  rectangular  wafers  in\nthe future.\nTable A1-1\na/b RatioA (mm\n2\n)A/square"),(0,a.yg)("ol",null,(0,a.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"000800.0100%"),(0,a.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"414754.294.3%"),(0,a.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"000640.080.0%\n543210\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n10 00\na/ bratio\na : b =    2 : 1\nP\nEffective Area (mm\n2\n)\nFigure A1-1\nEffective Area as a Function of a/b Ratio")),(0,a.yg)("p",null,"SEMI M23.3-0600 \xa9 SEMI 1994, 20003\na\nb\nd\nO.
