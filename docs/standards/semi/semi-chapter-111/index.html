GUIDELINE FOR FUNCTIONAL TESTING OF MICROELECTRONIC
RESISTS
1  Purpose
The  purpose  of  this  guideline  is  to  provide  a  baseline
program  of  test  procedures  needed  to  functionally  test
liquid-developed  resists,  resist  developers,  and  rinses
for microelectronic applications. It can also be used as a
guide   to   evaluate   process   modifications   to   such
systems. This guideline is intended to be applicable for
photo, DUV, x-ray, and electron beam processes.
2  Background
Release   of   the   information   in   this   document   was
approved  by  the  SEMI  Photolithographic  Chemicals
Committee   (Resist   Committee)   in   May   1987.   This
committee plans to complete and revise the guideline as
appropriate. Comments will be welcomed.
3  Scope
Virtually  all  lithographic  fabrication  processes  vary  in
some  way  from  location  to  location,  even  for  the  same
type of resist. Consequently, it is impossible to provide
a stringent evaluation program acceptable to most users.
It  is,  therefore,  the  aim  of  this  guideline  to  provide  a
program  of  tests  and  methods  that  allows  variable,  but
controlled,  process  differences.  In  order  to  maintain  a
proper baseline control for each process, all tests should
be run relative to some internal standard product whose
functional  characteristics  are  known  and  characterized.
It is understood that each product is to be run at its own
preferred or recommended conditions and that different
products maybe evaluated under different conditions. It
should   also   be   understood   that   some   properties,
variables, or conditions, such as normality, are specific
to resist type, such as positive photoresist, and are to be
used only where applicable. Further, since this guide is
directed  to  functional  testing,  it  is  assumed  that  any
products   to   be   evaluated   have   passed   all   relevant
chemical  and  physical  testing  before  such  functional
testing.
4  Priorities
This   guideline   has   been   divided   into   two   separate
groups.   The   first   group,   called   “Sustaining   Tests,”
includes tests that are necessary for timely adjustments
to coating and exposure conditions in order to maintain
consistent  image  dimensions  (Tables  1–3).  The  second
group, called “Extended Testing,” includes tests that are
required for full evaluation of the resist system (Tables
4–6).  These  tests  may,  or  may  not,  be  necessary  for
evaluation  of  each  lot  of  product,  depending  on  the
individual requirements of the user.

SPECIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES FOR PHOTOMASK ORDERS
This  specification  was  technically  approved  by  the  global  Micropatterning  Committee.    This  edition  was
approved  for  publication  by  the  global  Audits  and  Reviews  Subcommittee  on  April  20,  2005.    It  was
available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  in  June  2005  and  on  CD-ROM  in  July  2005.    Originally  published  in  1990;
previously published July 2004.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1  These data structure specifications are intended to facilitate the transmittal of mask order data between software
systems to allow:
• automated  order  placement  by  mask  customers  and  to  allow  the  automatic  processing  of  such  orders  by  mask
shops, and
• automated  delivery  of  actual  mask  data  by  mask  shops  and  to  allow  the  automatic  processing  of  such  data  by
mask customers.</li><li>2  By using these standardized structures, software written independently for either mask customers or mask shops
should be able to communicate unambiguously with software written by other parties.
2  Scope</li><li>1  This  structure  only  defines  the  data  format  for  the  transmitted  file.  No  particular  database  or  programming
language is specified by this standard, except that implementation of the Mask Results Data Structure Syntax is also
shown  in  Extensible  Markup  Language  (XML)  Format  for  those  that  choose  to  use  it.  The  data  file  is  to  be
transmitted as an ASCII file. As such, it is compatible with the SECS-II standard.
NOTICE:  This  standard  does  not  purport  to  address  safety  issues,  if  any,  associated  with  its  use.    It  is  the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish  appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine  the
applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  For a given customer, all pattern file names must be unique. (i.e., Pattern files which are different may not have
the same name.)</li><li>2  For  a  given  customer,  all  job  file  names  must  be  unique.  (i.e.,  Job  files  which  are  different  may  not  have  the
same name.)</li><li>3  For a given customer, each mask set must have a unique identification.</li><li>4  For  a  given  customer,  each  magnetic  tape  or  other  physical  media  delivered  to  the  mask  shop  must  have  a
unique identification.</li><li>5  All          pattern_data,          job_data,          FRACTURE_FILE,          MEASURE_FILE_NAME          and
CD_MATRIX_FILE_NAME  files  should  be  introduced  through  a  data  structure  to  be  used  within  the
mask_order.    If  such  files  are  referenced  in  a  mask_order  without  identification  through  data,  specific
methods to identify and locate such files must be established between the customer and the vendor.

6  Instructions and Conventions
6. 1  Each record in the file will be composed of a specific keyword identifier followed by one or more data values,
and will be terminated by a carriage return and/or linefeed.
6. 2  Only records which are required to specify the order need to be included in the transmitted mask_order file,
but each record included must appear in the sequence shown in the syntax specification.
6. 3  Subsequent modifications or additions to the mask set require transmittal of all the information for the specific
masks  involved,  including  previously  transmitted  keywords  and  data  fields  if  they  still  apply.  Masks  previously
ordered which are not affected by the new order transmission may have their mask_definition, mask_group or
mask_set omitted as appropriate.
6. 4  Options  are  specified  hierarchically  such  that  those  specified  at  a  higher  level  are  the  default  for  all  masks
below, unless overridden at a lower level. The hierarchy is such that mask set options are overridden by mask group
options, followed by mask definition, cell definition, cell instance, pattern group definition, and pattern definition.
6. 5  Mask  groups  describe  sets  of  masks  which  are  similarly  constructed.  In  simple  cases  there  will  be  only  one
mask  group  per  mask  set.  Multiple  mask  groups  will  be  needed  to  describe  mix-and-match  sets,  or  for  situations
within a mask set where different features are required on some masks.
6. 6  Pattern  group  definitions  are  intended  for  patterns  which  are  similarly  placed  on  all  or  most  masks  within  a
mask group (e.g., primary pattern files or test pattern files).
6. 7  Cell   definitions   describe   the   construction   of   clusters   of   pattern   groups   and/or   other   cells.   The
PLACEMENT_TOP_CELL  under  a  mask  group  describes  the  overall  layout  of  the  cells  on  all  masks  within  the
mask group.</p><p>1 International Organization for Standardization, ISO Central Secretariat, 1, rue de Varembé, Case postale 56, CH-1211 Geneva 20, Switzerland.

6. 8  Within a given mask set, each mask must have a unique identification (MASK<em>ID), independent of any titles on
the mask.
6. 9  Masks  which  require  multiple  writing  operations  (such  as  phase  shift  masks)  will  find  those  MASK_ID’s
identified with the same group number by the MULTIWRITE keyword.
6. 10  The  MASK_ID’s  defined  under  a  mask  group  specify  the  masks  to  be  built.  The  MASK_ID’s  also  identify
which patterns are to appear on the mask. A pattern is placed on the mask if and only if the MASK_ID matches the
LEVEL_ID of a pattern referenced under the mask group’s PLACEMENT_TOP_CELL.
6. 11  cell instance and pattern group instance LOCATION’s position the center of the patterns relative to the
center of the CELL_ID referencing them. The cell referenced by the PLACEMENT_TOP_CELL is positioned at the
center of the mask.
6. 12  Job file data may be supplied in place of cell and pattern group data. In this case, the MASK_ID is understood
to correspond to JOB_LEVEL in JOB_NAME.
6. 13  For  coordinate  locations,  unless  otherwise  specified  for  a  given  keyword,  mask  options  are  relative  to  the
nominal  center  of  the  mask,  while  cell  or  pattern  options  are  relative  to  the  center  of  the  cell  or  pattern.    Mask
coordinates are after scaling and mirroring, whereas cell and pattern options are before scaling and mirroring.  The
coordinates  and  directions  refer  to  right-handed,  rectangular  (Cartesian)  coordinates,  applied  to  the  substrate  being
written.  All of these features and the orientation of all other patterns written on the substrate assume that it is from
the perspective of the mask writing tool (i.e., “chrome side up”). The nominal center of the mask is determined using
the bottom and left edges (chrome side up) and assumes nominal substrate dimensions. (See SEMI P1.)
6. 14  All data in the structure will be in ASCII. The keyword in each record must include only upper case alphabetic
characters and underscore.
6. 15  Records (keyword, data value, comment and new line) may not exceed 256 characters. Some records may be
repeated (e.g., BUSINESS_ADDRESS) in order to allow for longer field requirements; these are explicitly indicated
in the syntax specification.
6. 16  Comments may be included in records by preceding them with an exclamation point (!). Any data following an
exclamation  point  and  preceding  a  carriage  return  and/or  linefeed  will  be  ignored.  Such  comments  are  included  in
the 256 character record limit. If a record starts with an exclamation  point,  the  entire  record  will  be  ignored.  Only
printable  ASCII  characters  (plus  spaces  and  tabs)  are  permitted  in  comments.  Comments  are  for  development  and
diagnostic  purposes  only.  In  commercial  use,  comments  may  always  be  ignored  by  the  recipient  without
consequence. On the other hand, ADDITIONAL</em>..._INFO records must be evaluated by the recipient and applied to
the masks being ordered, and may justify delay in mask delivery.
6. 17  Spaces  or  tabs  preceding  the  keyword  will  be  ignored.  At  least  one  space  or  tab  must  precede  the  data  field.
Spaces and tabs imbedded in alphanumeric data fields will be preserved. Spaces or tabs may not be imbedded within
numeric  data  values,  but  may  be  used  to  separate  data  values  in  multi-value  data  fields.  At  least  one  comma  must
appear  between  adjacent  data  values  in  multi-value  data  fields;  more  than  one  comma  may  not  appear  between
adjacent data values. Spaces or tabs trailing the last data value in a data field will be ignored.
6. 18  All  numeric  record  values  which  require  units  will  be  in  metric  unless  otherwise  specified  in  §8.  Units  of
length or position will be in microns unless otherwise specified.
6. 19  Dates will be in the numeric format YYYY-MM-DD. Times will be in the format HH:MM:SSZ or HH:MMZ.
Within  the  transmitted  file,  times  and  dates  will  always  be  Coordinated  Universal  Time  (UTC)  and  times  will  be
followed by the suffix Z.
6. 20  Sizing  to  achieve  a  CD_TARGET  from  a  CD_DATA  must  be  applied  to  all  pattern  files  hierarchically
affected by the CD_TARGET record.
6. 21  Binary  data  manipulation  operations  expect  operands  (input  pattern  files)  to  align  center-to-center.  This
requires that DATA_PATTERN_WINDOW be defined for patterns which do not contain an explicit record of file
extents.
6. 22  All  references  to  horizontal  (or  “x”)  and  vertical  (or  “y”)  correspond  to  normal  Cartesian  coordinates  and
assume the rotational orientation of the substrate when the mask was written.</p><p>SEMI P10-0705 © SEMI 1990, 2005 4
6. 23  All  shippable_data  keywords  can  be  followed  by  ship_to  specifying  the  destination  and/or  method  of
transmission for the transmitted data. Whenever applicable, the SEMI mask_results file (see §7.5) should be sent
accordingly if electronic transmission is specified.
6. 24  shippable_data   keywords   which   require   reference   to   specific   mask   feature   locations   will   reference
CD_SITE_ID  and/or  REGISTR_MARK_ID  which  must  be  unique  for  each  location  within  all  transmissions  of
mask_order for a given MASK_SET_ID.
6. 25  When  modifications  to  this  standard  are  required  between  ballot  cycles  (e.g.  new  data  field  values  “on
request”), users should contact the N.A. SEMI P10 task force leader directly.  After a poll  of  the  active  task  force
members, a tentative recommendation will be posted on the SEMI P10 task force web site at SEMI so that all users
can adopt a common interim solution until a formal ballot can officially resolve the issue.
6. 26  Every effort should be made to construct a SEMI P10 file without inconsistencies or ambiguities.  If a vendor
detects  such  flaws  in  a  file  from  a  customer,  the  vendor  should  contact  the  customer  to  correct  the  inconsistencies
and/or remove the ambiguities before proceeding with making the mask.
7  Syntax Specification
The following specifies the syntax for the mask order structures. The record order is specific; records must appear in
the sequence shown. Terminology for the individual records and their allowed data values are specified in §8.
7. 1  Syntax  Symbol  Definition  —  The  lower  case  syntactic  names  within  &lt;  &gt;  are  used  to  refer  to  collections  of
records.  The  use  of  {  }  around  records  or  collections  of  records  means  an  arbitrary  number  of  repetitions  of  the
records,  including  none  at  all.  The  use  of  <!-- -->[  ]<!-- -->  around  a  record  or  collection  of  records  means  that  the  collection  is
optional.
7. 2  Record Syntax ⎯ A keyword is followed by a data field which is followed by an optional comment. The record
is terminated by a carriage return and/or linefeed. Each of these elements may be preceded by any combination of
spaces  or  tabs,  which  will  be  ignored.  At  least  one  space  or  tab  is  required  preceding  the  first  data  value  in  the
record.  An  exclamation  point  (!)  is  required  to  initiate  a  comment.  Exclamation  points,  carriage  returns,  and
linefeeds are not allowed in keywords, data values or comments. Note that a record consisting of a comment only is
also allowed. The syntax for individual records is defined as:
record = <!-- -->[{separator} keyword
separator {separator} data_field][{separator} ! comment]<!-- -->
{separator} new_line
where “separator” is a space or a tab, “comment” is any string of printable ASCII characters (plus spaces and tabs),
and “new_line” is a carriage return, linefeed or both.
7. 3  Multi-value  Data  Field  Syntax  —  When  data_field  contains  more  than  one  data_value,  such  as  (x,y)  pairs  or
(x1,y1,x2,y2)  double  pairs  (see  §8),  the  individual  values  must  be  separated  by  a  comma  and  any  combination  of
spaces  or  tabs.  One  comma  is  required  between  each  data_value,  but  not  more  than  one  comma.  Two  commas
without an intervening data value are not permissible.
(x,y) = data_value {separator} comma {separator} data_value
(x,y,z) = (x,y) {separator} comma {separator} (z)
(x1,y1,x2,y2) = (x1,y1) {separator} comma {separator} (x2,y2)
(x,y,x1,y1,x2,y2) = (x,y) {separator} comma {separator} (x1,y1,x2,y2)
For data manipulation operations only, a semicolon separates layers from its datatype, and a dash indicates a range
of layers or a range of datatypes.

7. 4  Mask Order Structure Syntax — The following syntax definition uses the upper case keyword to represent the
permissible applications of the corresponding data record within the mask order structure.</p><p>mask_order =  START_ORDER   SEMI_REVISION  CUSTOMER VENDOR
