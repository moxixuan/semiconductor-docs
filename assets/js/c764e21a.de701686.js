Other methods of messagecommunication are possible but beyond the scope ofthis standard.This standard is intended to be one of possibly severalsupplements to the CTMC SEMI E38. 3 Referenced Documents3.1 SEMI Standards1 The following SEMI standards are related to theCommunications Environment standard:SEMI E5  SEMI Equipment CommunicationStandard 2 - Message Content (SECS -II).SEMI E37  High-Speed SECS Message Services(HSMS) Generic ServicesSEMI E37.2  High-Speed SECS Message ServicesGeneral Session (HSMS-GS)3.2 IEEE Standards2 The following IEEE standard is related to theCommunications Environment standard:IEEE 802.3  Carrier Sense Multiple Access withCollision Detection 4 DefinitionsThe following definitions are arranged in alphabeticalorder. Some are defined using terms defined elsewherewithin this section. No definitions beyond this sectionand the referenced standards should be necessary for abasic understanding of these terms. 1 Semiconductor Equipment & Materials International, 805 EastMiddlefield Road, Mountain View, CA 940432 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, 345 East 47thStreet, New York, NY 10017 10 BASE 2  a common physical medium for thetransmission of Ethernet signals.AUI (Attachment Unit Interface)  a specification ofthe connector, pins, and signals used to interface acomputer to a MAU. Defined formally in IEEE 802.3.Cluster Tool Environment  a collection ofinterconnected modules forming a cluster tool.Communications Stack  a specification of successivelayers of interfaces through which communicationservices are provided.Ethernet  a method of transmitting signals. Ethernetis defined formally by IEEE 802.3MAU (Medium Attachment Unit)  an adaptor fromthe AUI interface to a physical wire or medium such as10 BASE 2. Defined formally in IEEE 802.3Platform  a physical computer in a cluster tool thatcontains the Ethernet Interface or station as defined inIEEE 802.3. In a cluster tool, a platform may have oneor more logical modules residing on it. 5 Required SessionsIn order to support the Services specified in the CTMCstandard, there is an associated set of Protocol standardsthat specify a set of SECS-II messages to support theseServices. This standard specifies the transmission ofthese SECS-II messages using HSMS sessions.In order to communicate with a given logical module, aseparate HSMS connection (TCP/IP connection) isrequired per logical module.For correct operation of a cluster tool using thesefacilities, a set of standard sessions, given in Table 1, isrequired. Other sessions are possible, but are notrequired. In order to be compliant a module must notrequire further sessions in order to operate.Table 1 Required Sessions Client Server ServicesCluster Controller TransportModuleObject Services,Material Movement,Exception Management,Event ReportingCluster Controller CassetteModuleObject Services,Material Movement,Exception Management,Event Reporting"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 5 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E38.1-95 \xa9 SEMI 1995 2 Client Server ServicesCluster Controller ProcessModuleObject Services,Processing Management,Recipe Management,Material Movement,Exception Management,Event ReportingCassette Module TransportModuleObject Services,Material MovementProcess Module TransportModuleObject Services,Material Movement 6 Communication Stack Sp ecificationThere are many layers of software required in order tocommunicate using a facility such as HSMS. In order tointeroperate, modules shall have identical or equivalentprotocols at each layer on both sides of a physicalconnection.HSMS does not specify a particular physical layer. Inorder to ensure interoperability between modules, ofpossibly different origin, a complete interoperablecommunication stack is required.6.1 SECS-II Messages  The Clu ster Tool ModuleCommunications (CTMC) standard specifies a set ofmessaging services from applicable standards for useby a cluster tool module. Each service standard has asupplemental protocol standard which defines theSECS-II message support. This standard specifies amethod for transporting these SECS-II messages. Inorder to be compliant with this standard, these SECS-IImessages must be used. The detail of the SECS-IImessages is found in SEMI E5. SECS-II messagedefinitions refer to messages communicating between ahost and equipment. With reference to implementingCTMC, the host is the service-user or cluster-controlling entity, and the equipment is the service-provider or cluster module entity.6.2 HSMS Messaging  For the p urposes ofcommunication of SECS-II messages within the clustertool communication environment, SEMI High-SpeedSECS Message Service (HSMS) shall be used (SEMIE37).CTMC defines a number of services. For inter-module,and service user-to-module communication, manyservices will be required simultaneously. As a result,the capabilities of the HSMS General Session (SEMIE37.2) are required and shall be used forcommunication of all services specified by the CTMC.6.2.1 IP Addresses, Port Numbers, a nd Session IDs HSMS defines the setting of IP Addresses, PortNumbers, and Session IDs. In order to uniquely specifya service, all three are required as configuration parameters. The actual numbers shall be within theallowed range and unique within their respectivedomains. Table 2 shows these parameters, what theydefine, and their respective domains.Table 2 Configuration Parameters Parameter Defines Domain of UniquenessIP Address Platform NetworkPort Number TCP/IP Connection PlatformSession ID CTMC Service TCP/IP Connection 6.2.2 Session IDs  Each associati on required byCTMC (such as Processing, Material Movement,Exception, etc.) shall have a session within aconnection. These Session IDs shall be documented bythe service provider, and, if configurable, the method ofconfiguration shall be documented.The Session ID for a given service shall be defined andmay be dictated by the service provider (at the serverend of a connection).In order to use a service, the service user (which is theclient end of the connection) shall select the service bySession ID. Thus, the Session ID shall be configurablefor the service user and the method of configuring shallbe documented for each service user. Session IDs shallbe as shown in Table 3.Object services shall use Session ID 1; all otherservices shall use Session IDs from the range labeledAvailable in Table 3.Table 3 Allowed Session IDs Session ID Service0 Reserved1 Object Services2-63 Reserved (future)64-65534 Available65535 (OxFFFF) Reserved (HSMS) 6.2.3 Linktest  The linktest proced ure is an optionalfacility of HSMS. For the purposes of cluster toolcommunications, the linktest procedure as described inthe HSMS standard shall be supported. On detection ofa linktest timeout, a communication failure will beconsidered to have occurred, and higher communicationlayers shall be notified of this failure.6.2.4 Connection Mode  HSMS provides for Active,Passive, and Alternating Connection Modes. For thepurposes of establishing connections in a cluster tool,either Active or Passive shall be used. For each serviceprovided, there is a service provider (server) and aservice user (client). With respect to each service, the"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 6 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E38.1-95 \xa9 SEMI 19953 client shall connect in the Active mode and the server inthe Passive mode. Table 1 specifies the client andserver (and hence connection mode) of the requiredsessions.In addition to establishing the connection, the clientshall initiate the sessions with the Select message, asdefined in HSMS. As a result, all sessions at the clientend of a connection shall be service users and allsessions at the server end of the connection shall beservice providers.6.3 Use of TCP/IP  HSMS defin es the use ofTCP/IP for communication of messages. Othersimultaneous uses of TCP/IP are possible but beyondthe scope of this standard.Within TCP, Port Numbers are used to uniquelyidentify the connection on a given platform. A portnumber may be any value between 0 and 65535, butTCP reserves port numbers starting at 0. Refer toHSMS and the references given in HSMS for thedefinition of the reserved port numbers.Multiple logical modules may exist on a givenplatform. Each service for a logical module on a givenplatform must use a unique session within a connection.It is possible to configure a module so that each logicalmodule uses a separate connection, but it is alsopossible for several logical modules to share aconnection. Each service requires a unique connectionfor each external entity, but an external entity may,depending on the configuration, access the services ofseveral logical modules on a platform, identifying themby unique session, except for Object Services. ObjectServices is always identified by Session ID 1.Connection to a specific module shall be establishedusing a non-reserved port number which is uniqueamong modules on that platform. A given service mayhave several simultaneous connections.6.3.1 Setting Port Number  The po rt numbers usedfor establishing HSMS connections shall beconfigurable for both the service user and serviceprovider. This is because the port numbers may be usedby some other software entity on the same platform.Port numbers shall be chosen that are not in thereserved range and do not conflict with any othersoftware entity on the platform. The method ofconfiguration of the port numbers shall be documented.6.4 Physical Layer  HSMS allow s for manydifferent physical layers. In order for modules to interoperate, a single physical layer is required. Thisstandard specifies Ethernet  as defined in the standardIEEE 802.3  to be used for physical layertransmission of HSMS messages.Other physical layers could be used, but the use of othersuch physical layers is not supported by this standard. Itis anticipated that other related standards will bedeveloped to support other physical layers. In such acase, only those modules compliant with the samestandard would be interoperable.6.5 Media and Connectors  Wit h Ethernet, there is achoice of media used (twisted pair, coax, etc.). It isbeyond the scope of this standard to specify the mediaused. The media is thus left to the configuration of aspecific cluster tool and may depend on the availablemedia used in the factory.Most Ethernet interfaces provide a media-independentAUI interface. A transceiver is then used to access thephysical media. In order to be compliant with thisstandard, a module shall provide an AUI interface.Many interfaces also provide a media-specific interface.This media specific interface may be used in the eventthat the cluster tool media is the same as the mediaspecific interface. 7 ComplianceCompliance with this standard includes adherence to allstated requirements where implemented. In order to becompliant to this standard, an implementation shall:1. use SECS-II messages as specified by CTMCdocument,2. use SEMI E37 (HSMS) and SEMI E37.2 (HSMS-GS),3. allow and document IP Address configuration,4. allow and document Session ID configuration,5. allow and document Port ID configuration,6. use Ethernet as defined in IEEE 802.3,7. provide an AUI connector.Some Ethernet interfaces provide additional connectors(such as 10 BASE 2 or thinnet). These may be used incases where this is the medium chosen, but forcompliance, an AUI connector shall be provided."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 7 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E38.1-95 \xa9 SEMI 1995 4 APPENDIX 1APPLICATION NOTES NOTE: This appendix was approved as a part of SEMI E38.1 by full letter ballot procedure. A1-1 Example ConfigurationThe following example shows configuration of a clustertool consisting of an existing process module with anew cluster controller and other modules.The cluster consists of a Cluster Controller, two ProcessModules (PM1, PM2), and a combinedTransport/Cassette Module (TM/CM).A1-1.1 IP Addresses  IP addresses are chosen so thatthey are unique to each platform on the network andconsistent with the conventions used at the facility. Forthis example, the convention is to use 192.25.63.X forIP Addresses, where X is between 0 and 255. PM1 hadan existing IP address of 192.25.63.122, which will notbe changed. IP addresses starting at 205 are unused andthus available. Thus, the following IP addresses arechosen:Cluster Controller 192.25.63.205TM and CM 192.25.63.206PM1 192.25.63.122PM2 192.25.63.207 As part of the configuration, the IP Address of eachmodule is identified as shown above, on all of theplatforms. This configuration depends on the TCP/IPsoftware used on the respective platforms.A1-1.2 Port Numbers  TCP reserves port numbersbelow 1024 in RFC1340. There are no other TCP/IPprograms on any of the platforms in the cluster usingport number in the range 2000-10000, so the followingport numbers are chosen:2000 first TM5000 first CM8000 first PM8001 second PM The cluster controller is always a client and initiates theconnections, so no port number assignment is required.A1-1.3 Session ID Assignment  Before defining theSession IDs, recall that the following connections arerequired: Client ServerCC TMCC CMCC PM1CC PM2CM TMPM1 TMPM2 TM The Session IDs are arbitrary. PM1 already has IDswhich are as follows:PM1 IDsClientsObject Services 1 CC, TMProcessing Management 100 CCRecipe Management 101 CCMaterial Movement 102 CC, TMException Management 103 CCEvent Reporting 104 CC The other modules have not yet been set, so we chooseto begin with ID 64.The session IDs are established as follows:PM2 IdsClientsObject Services 1 CC, TMProcessing Management 64 CCRecipe Management 65 CCMaterial Movement 66 CC, TMException Management 67 CCEvent Reporting 68 CC TM IDsClientsObject Services 1 CCMaterial Movement 64 CCException Management 65 CCEvent Reporting 66 CC CM IDsClientsObject Services 1 CC, TMMaterial Movement 64 CC, TMException Management 65 CCEvent Reporting 66 CC"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 8 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E38.1-95 \xa9 SEMI 19955 NOTICE: These standards do not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with their use.

Originally each proposal included aservice-specific message for getting the values of anobject's attributes, and some also provided a service-specific message for setting these values.6.1.1 The decision was made to eliminate thisredundancy through provision of a standard to providethose definitions and services used by the other separateservice standards. 7 Applicable DocumentsSEMI Book of Standards, Equipment Automation/Software Volumes 1 and 25 ISO/TR 8509:1987,6 Information Processing Systems,Open Systems Interconnection  Service ConventionsWilliam Stallings, Networking Standards, A Guide toOSI, ISDN, LAN, and MAN Standards, Addison-WesleyPublishing Company 8 Basic Concepts and Behavior8.1 This section defines the concepts and behavior thatare common to public objects.8.1.1 Object-oriented analysis is a widely acceptedtool, both for applications that are implemented using 5 This set of documents may be obtained from SEMI, 3081 ZankerRoad, San Jose, CA 95134.6 International Organization for Standardization, ISO CentralSecretariat, 1, rue de Varemb, Case postale 56, CH-1211 Geneva 20,Switzerland.

Object information models provide apowerful method for describing relationships that canbe intuitively understood.8.1.2 For those unfamiliar with object-orientedterminology, a brief discussion of terms is provided inthe Appendix.8.2 Object Attributes  An object attribute is a datavalue that is held by all instances of a given object type.For communication purposes, public attributes areassigned a logical name that is unique for that object.An object's attributes may be individually referencedeither by an enumerated numeric value or by a reservedattribute name that conforms to the use of text definedin Section 8.1.1.8.2.1 An attribute that can be requested or referencedthrough formal public services is a public attribute.Other attributes may exist in specific implementationsbut are invisible through public services and are calledprivate attributes.8.2.2 Specific attributes may be designated asfundamental for a specific object. These shall besupported by all implementations that use or referencethe specified object. Attributes that are not fundamentalare optional.8.2.3 Use of Text  Values defined as text, whengiven in ASCII, are subject to certain restrictions. Thisincludes object attribute values, attribute names, andservice parameters.8.2.3.1 Text in ASCII is restricted to the charactersbetween 20 16 and 7E16, excluding the question mark?, the asterisk ","*",", and the tilde ~.8.2.3.2 The question mark and asterisk are reserved foruse as wild characters in filters and searches, whilethe tilde is reserved to allow systems that cannot usespaces to convert spaces to tildes for internal use.8.2.3.3 Text used in specific contexts may haveadditional restrictions.8.2.3.4 Unless otherwise stated, case is not significantfor purposes of comparison. However, case is used toimprove readability and should be preserved wheneverpossible.8.2.4 Object Type  An object always knows its type.For this reason, the attribute for object type, ObjType,is required for all public objects. ObjType is a textstring containing the formal classification of an object.The text string shall conform to the convention definedin Section 8.1.1, with the additional restriction that thegreater than symbol ",">"," and the colon : are alsoexcluded. The text string shall not start or end with aspace. 8.2.4.1 Object types (the values for ObjType) forstandardized objects are reserved. Types reserved arespecific to individual standards.8.2.5 Object Identifier  Every instance of an objectshall have one or more attributes that together uniquelydistinguish that instance from all other instances ofobjects of the same object type. An object may havemore than one identifier. The identifier(s) are defined aspart of the object definition.8.2.5.1 ObjID is a text-based fundamental attribute ofall public objects and provides an attribute of a knownform to serve as an identifier for an object of any type.The text string shall conform with the conventiondefined in Section 8.1.1 and with the additionalrestriction that the greater than symbol ",">"," and thecolon : are also excluded. The text string shall notstart or end with a space.8.2.5.2 From the point of view of objects such asmanagers, aggregates, and containers that haveresponsibilities for other objects (see Sections 9.1 and9.2) the combination of ObjType and ObjID for theseother objects shall be unique. For example, if severalprocess chambers have a single vacuum pump, eachprocess chamber may have direct access to at most oneObjType:ObjID",">"," combination of Pump:Vacuum.However, the combination is not required to be uniqueacross the different chambers. The host differentiatesbetween the several vacuum pumps by their belongingto different aggregations.8.2.5.3 The object definition for each object shallspecify the particular identifier used for general access.For objects that normally use an identifier with anumeric value as an identifier (such as handle,described below), the value of ObjID is a numeric textstring set to the value of that attribute.8.2.5.4 An object may also have other identifiers inaddition to ObjID.8.2.6 Object Handle  An object's handle is anattribute with a numeric value that is assigned by theapplication that created the object. The handle may beused for the object's identifier. It is generally intendedfor local use and may or may not be defined as a publicattribute in the object's formal definition.8.2.6.1 Where used, the handle may be guaranteed tobe unique only within a specific context and within asingle association between service-provider andservice-user for a specific service resource. The handlemay or may not be persistent beyond a certain contextwithin that association or beyond it.

That is,all objects shall respond to the object attributesObjType and text strings, and all public objects shallrecognize and respond to the operations get attributesand set attributes. Figure 1Top Object 8.3.2 Formal definition of an object shall include atable defining the object's public attributes. The ObjectAttribute Definition table for the top object is given inTable 1 below. It contains the two fundamentalattributes required of all public objects.Table 1 Top Object Attribute Definition Name Definition Access Req FormObjType The object type. RO Y TextObjID The object's identifier. RO Y Text 8.3.3 Access refers to the ability to read and write thevalue of the attribute through OSS services. Anobjects type and identifier may not be changed throughOSS services. However, it may be possible for theservice user to assign a value for the object's identifierat the time the object (instance) is created. This dependson the object and the services provided. 9 Object Relationships9.1 This section addresses relationships betweenobjects that affect communications, either by restrictingcommunications or through information concerningrelationships.9.2 Object Hierarchy  Certain objects may bespecified as aggregation objects or as container objectswhen they are defined.9.2.1 An aggregation object is composed of otherobjects called the components of the aggregation. This is illustrated in Figure 2. Components may be of one ormore different types, or they may be of the same type. Figure 2Aggregation with Two Component Types 9.2.2 Container objects contain other objects, of thesame or different types, but are not made up of them.9.2.3 Figure 3 shows two object types that areassociated with a relationship called contains. Thesolid circle indicates that Type-1 may contain zero ormore objects of Type-2 type. An example of a commoncontainer type is a file directory. Figure 3Container and Contents 9.2.4 An aggregation loses some degree of integrity ifcertain of its components are missing, while a containerretains full integrity even if it has no contents. Anautomobile is an aggregation of many components,some of which are themselves aggregations. Anautomobile may also have contents (driver, passengers,belongings) which are removable and not considered ascomponents. Other examples of container objectsinclude lists, dictionaries, and libraries. A container thathas no contents is said to be empty.9.2.5 The aggregation or container is called thesuperior object and its components or contents arecalled subordinate objects.9.2.6 In addition to the relationships of is composedof (roles: aggregate/component) and contains (roles:container/contents), the other hierarchical relationshipthat occurs naturally in factories and in control systemsis that of supervises (roles: supervisor/supervised).This denotes a control relationship where thesupervised object accepts part or all of its directionsfrom the supervisor. The supervisor, in turn, hasresponsibilities that it delegates to the supervised. Thesupervisor typically will also have a relationship of iscomposed of or contains with its supervisedsubordinates."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 17 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E39-0703 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 20039 9.3 Scope and Ownership  The hierarchicalrelationships of aggregations, containers, andsupervisors may at times be required for pointing to aspecific object. These relationships may be shown witha multi-level tree structure, as shown in Figure 4.Subordinate objects at one level may be the superiorobjects at the next lower level. The superior object atthe highest level is called the root of the tree.NOTE 1: Figure 4 is not drawn in OMT notation.9.3.1 An owner object is an object that is an aggregate,container, or supervisor. An owned object is an objectthat is a component of, contained in, or supervised by,an owner object.9.3.2 Scope7 is the concept and method of pointing toa specific owned object through the use of sequence ofhierarchical relationships. Scope allows any particularobject (type or instance) within such a hierarchical treeto be fully specified by providing a unique path downthis tree using a concatenation of object types andidentifiers. Figure 4Example of Owner Hierarchy 9.3.3 This path is used to create an object specifier thatis represented as a sequence of concatenated text stringsof the form type:id",">",", which may be repeated asnecessary to form the complete path. The character ",">","is used to terminate the object type field, and the coloncharacter : is used to terminate the identifier field.The object specifier uniquely identifies an object withinthe entire domain of objects and is able to extend thedomain within which a search for an object wouldotherwise occur.9.3.4 Formally, an object specifier is a formatted textstring of the form:type1 :id 1 ",">","...typen:id n",">"," 7 Scoping is used in material ISO 9595 (CMIS). where typei and id i represent the object type andobject identifier, respectively, of the ith object instancein the sequence, and where the ith object is owned bythe (i-1)th object and is the owner of the (i+1)th object.9.3.5 Figure 5 shows an example of a typical set ofhierarchical relationships in the factory. An applicationof scope might be through Cell AB, Cluster BB,Process Module (PM) CB, to Device DB. In thisexample, the object specifier for Device DB would be:FactoryHost:Hilda",">","Cell:AB",">","Cluster:BB",">","PM:CB",">","Device:DB",">",'9.3.6 It is generally not necessary to start with the rootobject. It is sufficient to start with an object that isowned by the communications partner. However, it isinvalid to omit a level in the hierarchy that is betweenthe starting object and the final object in the path.9.3.7 Some systems may be able to guarantee theuniqueness of object identifiers for their owned objects.For example, equipment may be able to guarantee thatall of its owned objects have unique identifiersregardless of type. In this case, an objects identifier issufficient to point to a specific object instance. Objecttype may be omitted without ambiguity, as it may beobtained as an attribute of the specified object. Theform of the path then becomes "id1',">","id 2",">",".idn",">",'". In theprevious example, this might be "AB',">","BB",">","CB",">","DB",">",'".9.3.8 Object type may also be omitted in applicationswhere it may be inferred without ambiguity within aparticular context. A service that is dedicated to aspecific object type X, for example, that is alwaysowned only by another specific object type Y, mayspecify usage for object type X. Since object type maythen be inferred from the context, object types X and Yneed not be included in a specifier for an object of typeX.9.3.9 The terminator of the final identifier is optional.This allows a single object identifier to be used as asimple object specifier. As a result, however, it may benecessary to provide string delimiters to preventpremature termination of string parsing in the event anidentifier contains one or more embedded spaces.9.3.10 Scope can be applied to any set of hierarchicalrelationships, given a minimum set of requirements forpublic objects: an object always knows its own type (ObjType), an object always knows its own identifier(s)(including ObjID), an owner object knows the types of objects that areits components and/or contents, or that it otherwise'),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 18 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E39-0703 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2003 10 supervises, and is able to determine their identifiers(see GetType, Section 11.6), an owner object is able to determine the types andidentifiers of its owned objects. Figure 5Hierarchical Relationships in the Factory 9.4 Multiple Inheritance Hierarchy  Multiplehierarchical inheritance may be required as an optionalcapability for pointing to a specific object that providesthe same services from the inherited objects. Usually,inherited services are implemented by the domainobject such that specifying overrides of attributes orservices from inherited objects is not required.Sometimes the capability to override specifiedattributes and services from inherited object isnecessary to resolve duplicated attribute names orservices or to allow duplicated names in user extendedobjects.9.4.1 If Andy an object TypeA inherits from objectTypeB and TypeC and a service requestor is focusingservices or attributes of the object TypeB rather thanthose with the same name in the object TypeC, thefollowing text string form could specify the focusedpart of the object Andy:TypeA@TypeB:Andy9.4.2 If any names of service and/or attribute thatTypeB provides are the same as those provided byTypeA or TypeC, then, the object Andy will have to bespecified with the complete explanation from thesupplier as how the object handles the exception andthe differences from the original attribute or services.So, the above expression is the same as TypeA:Andywithout notes to describe difference. 10 Additional Operations10.1 This section defines operations that are commonto many types of public objects but are not required forall types of public objects. These operations are notrequired for OSS compliance. However, they may berequired for support of specific object types defined byother standards that use OSS services.10.2 Create and Delete  Creation and deletion areoptional services for object lifecycle management.Object definitions may specify conditions under whichthe services are supported. Objects may be createdand/or deleted in other ways. For example, the creationand deletion of certain types of persistent objects maybe outside of the scope of OSS services, while transientobjects may be created and/or deleted automatically bytheir owners as the result of other activities.10.2.1 Create  The create operation creates aninstance of an object type.10.2.1.1 Initial settings for one or more attributes maybe specified by the service user. Initial settings may berequired, prohibited, or optional, depending upon thespecific object type. The ability to set attribute valuesthrough the create operation shall be clearly identifiedas part of the object definition for those objectssupporting the create operation. For example, the abilityto set the value of the object identifier ObjID may berequired, optional, or prohibited, depending upon thetype of object.10.2.1.2 The object definition may also specifyattributes of the new object instantiation that arereturned to the service user by the service provider.10.2.1.3 A request to create an object is invalid if itdoes not provide all required attribute settings, if itattempts to set prohibited attributes, or if it providesvalues invalid for a given attribute.10.2.1.4 The definitions of certain objects may specifythat the delete service only be provided to, or under theauthority of, the service user that requested the originalcreate operation. In this case, a private attribute (that is,an attribute not accessible through services defined inSection 11) named Delete Token shall return a uniqueinteger as an attribute of the new object. This attributeis then used in a subsequent request to delete the object.The service user may delegate this token at its owndiscretion.10.2.1.5 The create operation is invoked by the serviceCreate sent to the owner that is to instantiate thespecified object. In order for the Create service to beaccepted if no owner for the object to be created isdefined in the target entity or if it is physically outsideof the domain of the entity; the object specifier shalldefine the owner as   (an empty string). If the entity"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 19 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E39-0703 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 200311 is just the equipment rather than a component of theequipment; the owner may be defined asEquipmenteven if no such object is defined.10.2.2 Delete  The delete operation is the inverse ofthe create operation. Individual object types mayrestrict deletion based on well-defined set of criteria.For example, the definition of a type of container mayspecify that a container may only be deleted when it isempty.10.2.2.1 If an object to be deleted requires the authorityof the service user that invoked the original createoperation, then the Delete Token attribute of the targetobject shall be provided by the user of the deleteservice.10.2.2.2 A request to delete an object is invalid if itdoes not provide all required attribute settings or if itprovides values invalid for a given attribute.10.2.2.3 The delete operation is invoked by the serviceDelete sent to the object to be deleted.10.3 Attachment  When an object receives a remoterequest for an operation, it may be unable to identifythe requestor. At the same time, it may be necessary foran object to determine if certain messages were sent byits supervisor. This conflict is resolved by formalizingthe relationship between a supervised object and itssupervisor.10.3.1 Attachment is a dynamic behavioral bindingbetween two objects in a hierarchical relationshipwhere it is important that the attached (supervised)object be able to differentiate certain service requestsmade by its supervisor from other requests. An attachedobject has exactly one supervisor, as illustrated inFigure 6.10.3.2 An attached object may be detached from itscurrent supervisor, or it may be reattached to a differentsupervisor. The latter operation is used when theprevious supervisor has become damaged and is notintended as a general method for moving the objects attachment, as the former supervisor is not notified ofthe change.10.3.3 Attach  When sent to an unattached object,the attach operation creates a logical connectionbetween the object and a supervisor. The object that isbeing attached creates a unique, private, non-zeronumeric value, called an attach token. The attach tokenis treated as an attribute named AttachToken. It is aprivate attribute of the attached object, not visiblethrough basic OSS services (see Section 11).10.3.3.1 When an object is first created, it isunattached, and the value of its attach token is set to adefault value of zero. An object is attached to anotherobject as a formal relationship. The operation of attachgenerates the attach token, which is returned to theservice user. The supervisor uses this token insubsequent critical service requests to identify itself tothe attached object.10.3.3.2 The attach operation also may accept settingsfor one or more attributes of the attached object, asdefined for the attached object type. This allows thesupervisor to provide values for attributes that areotherwise regarded as read-only values and cannot beset through the SetAttr service defined in Section 11.An example of an attribute value that it is oftendesirable to access in this way is the object specifier ofthe supervisor.10.3.3.3 Requests to attach an object that attempt to setattributes shall be denied unless the attributes areamong those accessible to the supervisor and allspecified settings represent valid values of thoseattributes. The object type and identifier shall not bechanged by the supervisor.10.3.3.4 An attached object is owned by its supervisor.10.3.3.5 The attach operation is invoked by the mes-sage service Attach by an intended supervisor. Requeststo attach an already attached object shall be denied.

Theset attached attributes operation provides this capabilityto a supervisor of attached objects. The supervisoridentifies itself by using the attach token for that object.10.3.4.1 The definition of the attached object type mayrestrict the attributes that may be set by this operation.The attach set attributes operation shall be denied if theattributes or settings are invalid for this operation.10.3.4.2 The attach set attributes operation is invokedby the message service AttachSetAttr sent by theobjects supervisor and is otherwise invalid.10.3.5 Detach  The detach operation breaks thelogical connection between an attached object and itssupervisor. The attach token is reset to zero, and theobject becomes unattached.10.3.5.1 The detach operation is invoked by themessage service Detach sent by the objects supervisorand is otherwise invalid.10.3.6 Reattach  The reattach operation is similar tothe attach operation, except that it is sent only to anattached object to change the logical connection fromthe attached object to a new supervisor. This operationis used to replace a damaged supervisor. Any existingconnections to the old supervisor shall be closed. Notethe reattach operation is vulnerable to misuse.Applications supporting the reattach operation mayhave additional requirements, such as notification sentto the previous supervisor, to provide a trace of misuse.10.3.6.1 The reattach operation provides a uniqueattach token that has not been previously used by theattached object. This effectively disables its previoussupervisor.10.3.6.2 An attempt to reattach an object shall bedenied unless the attributes and settings are valid for theoperation.10.3.6.3 The reattach operation is invoked with themessage service Reattach sent to an attached object bythe objects new supervisor and is otherwise invalid.10.3.7 Attach Supervised Object  The attachsupervised object operation is invoked by a service userto request a supervisor to attach to itself a valid targetobject. If the supervised object does not already exist oris not a valid target type for the supervisor, then theattached supervised object operation shall fail. Theresults of the operation are returned to the service user.10.3.7.1 The attach supervised object operation isinvoked with the service AttachSupervisedObject. 10.3.8 Detach Supervised Object  The detachsupervised object operation is invoked by a service userto request a supervisor to detach from itself an attachedobject. The supervisor sends a detach request to thespecified attached object. Regardless of any responsefrom the specified supervised object, the supervisorshall consider it thereafter as unattached. This isrequired to allow a damaged attached object to beremoved. This operation is successful except when thetarget object is not already attached to the supervisor.10.3.8.1 The detach supervised object operation isinvoked with the service DetachSupervisedObject. 11 Services and Scenarios11.1 The services defined by OSS are contained inTable 2.Table 2 Object Services MessageService NameType Description GetAttr R Get values of specified attributesbased on attribute filters.SetAttr R Set values of specified attributesbased on attribute filters.GetAttrName R Get names of attributes of objectsowned by the service provider.GetType R Get types for objects owned by theservice provider. 11.2 Scope  Scope is supported through the objectspecifier parameter. The object specifier provides amethod for pointing to objects owned by the serviceprovider that are otherwise not accessible to the serviceuser. That is, the service provider may not providedirect services for, or to, that object. This can occurwhen an object for which the service provider offersservices is an owner object, such as an aggregate or filedirectory, as described in Section 9. In some cases, theowned object may itself be remote from the serviceprovider. For example, the owned object may beprovided by a separate system.11.2.1 The service provider may be an owner objectwith managerial responsibilities, and therefore it mayprohibit direct access to one of its component orcontained objects. In this case, requests concerning anowned object from a service consumer shall be directedto the owner object instead.11.2.2 Object services use the object specifier for theowner of the target object(s). The construction of theobject specifier is defined in Section 9."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 21 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E39-0703 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 200313 11.2.3 Object type may be omitted from the objectspecifier where it may be otherwise determined withoutambiguity. However, inclusion of type is always valid.11.3 Filtering  An attribute filter is an optional set ofone or more attribute qualifications. An attributequalification is a boolean expression that makes astatement about the presence or values of attributes in atarget object. It identifies an attribute, a qualifying valueof that attribute, and a qualifying relationship that thevalue has to the target attribute. The attribute filter is aboolean that consists of the expression formed by anAND of the set of qualifications.11.3.1 If the attribute is of text form, the qualifyingvalue may be used as a mask with the embedded wildcharacters ? (question mark) and ","*"," (asterisk). Thecharacter ? may be used within the mask to representany single character and may be repeated. The string????? represents any text string with a length of fivecharacters.11.3.2 The character ","*"," may be used in the mask torepresent a variable-length string, including a nullstring. The string ","*","x represents a string of any lengththat ends in x; the string x","*"," represents any stringthat begins with x.11.3.3 When the character ","*"," is used by itself as thestring ","*",", however, it represents any string of any non- zero length. It may also be repeated within a string, asin ","*","x","*","y","*",", which represents any string with embeddedcharacters x and y, such as abxaby, x","_","y, andxy.11.3.4 The comparison for text characters shall be caseinsensitive.11.3.5 The qualifying value specifies a qualifyingrelationship, R, between the value specified in theattribute qualification and the matching attribute ofobject instances. The qualifying value for the attributeis compared with the attribute of an instance of thetarget object to test the relationship.11.3.6 If the qualifying value has the relationship Rto the attribute of the target object, then the instancequalifies for the relationship and is included in the setof objects for which requested attributes are returned.For example, if the attribute name is Length,qualifying value is the number 5, and the qualifyingrelationship is is less than, then the Length attributesof all instances of the target object are tested. Allinstances with a Length attribute greater than 5 orequal to 5 qualify.11.4 Object Services Parameter Dictionary  Table 3defines all of the parameters, including the elements ofcomplex parameters, used in object services.

Theyaddress attribute values ofinstances of objects. Figures 7 and 8 show the messageflow for the GetAttr service. Figure 7GetAttr Message Flow Figure 8SetAttr Message Flow 11.5.1 GetAttr and SetAttr allow access to attributes ofobjects that are owned by another object and arecapable of addressing multiple levels of ownership(object hierarchy).11.5.1.1 For example, GetAttr may be used as a getdirectory request to find the identifiers of all instancesof one or more owned objects.11.5.2 GetAttr and SetAttr may be used for objects thatuse a complex identifier, such as recipes with separateattributes for name and version.11.5.3 GetAttr and SetAttr allow searching for thoseinstances of an object that satisfy certain conditionsthrough the specification of one or more qualifiers orfilters. Only attributes of those instances of the desiredobject type that satisfy the conditions defined in thefilters are returned by the service provider.11.5.3.1 The filter is familiar to users of file services asa convenient way to obtain a partial directory of files,such as files with a date later than a specified date. This is particularly useful when the list of contents may bequite long.11.5.4 The attribute value (all or a part of the list ofObjSetting) returned by the GetAttr service may beinvalid if the acknowledge code of ObjStatus indicatesa failure. In that case; the value(s) requested by theinvocation of GetAttr service may be unknown, invalidor unavailable by any reason (e.g. correspondinghardware status, lack of privilege, mutual exclusion orother requirement not fulfilled by the application).Supplier shall document all conditions or timingrequirements of any attributes if they are not alwaysavailable.11.5.5 The attribute value (all or a part of the list ofObjSetting) replied by the SetAttr service may be stillunchanged if the acknowledge code of ObjStatusindicates a failure. In that case; the attribute value maybe unchangeable, inhibited or blocked internally by anyreason (e.g. corresponding hardware status, lack ofprivilege, mutual exclusion or other requirement notfulfilled by the application. The object providing theSetAttr service shall identify whether or not it is validto change or set an attribute value. Supplier shalldocument all conditions and timing requirements ofeach attribute if they are not always allowed to be set.11.5.6 Object Specifier  This parameter is used forspecifying an owner object and may be omitted fromthe message. When included, it is a formatted textstring that conforms to the description in Section 9. Anobject specifier is rejected by service providers that donot use owner or owned objects.11.5.7 Filter  This is a optional list of qualificationsto be applied to specifed attribute and may be omittedfrom the message. When included, the complete filter isformed by a logical AND of each attribute qualificationin the list.11.5.8 Requested Attribute  The final parameter inthe GetAttr service gives the names of one or moreattributes of interest. These are the attributes whosevalues shall be returned in the response, in the orderrequested.11.5.9 Settings  In the SetAttr service, a list of one ormore attribute name/value pairs is specified. This is theset of desired attribute values.

It is a structure that consists ofan acknowledge code and a list of status parameters.The acknowledge code is used to indicate errors thatapply to the response as a whole. A status parameter is a structure consisting of a code indicating a specificerror and accompanying text providing additionalinformation.

In some cases,services that are invoked may report a failure. For example: the owner of an object shall not delete the object duringits lifecycle or while it is valid and required by another agent. Existence of an object may depend on preconditions,provided parameters, state of another object, corresponding operation, context of application, etc. Supplier shalldocument any restrictions or information regarding the validity of the additional services listed below.12.1.1 This section defines the services required for additional operations defined in Section 10.

The objectspecifier is omitted, and the object type is set to the typeof the target object. To get all of the objects attributes,both the attribute filter and the names of requestedattributes are also omitted.13.3 Determine All Objects of a Specific Type and withSpecific Characteristics  To determine subordinateobjects with specific characteristics, such as of typeModule with an identifier ObjID starting withABC, set object type to Module. In the attributefilter, set the attribute name to ObjID, set the attributevalue to ABC","*",", and set the qualifying relationship tois equal to (or omit it).13.4 Determine Specific Attributes of a Specific ObjectInstance  To determine the current value of certainattributes of a specific object, set the object typeappropriately. Either set the list of ObjID to a listcontaining the one identifier of the target instance, oralternatively, in the attribute filter, set the attributename to ObjID, set the attribute value to theidentifier, and set the qualifying relationship to isequal to (or omit it).13.5 Determine Types of Subordinate Objects  Todetermine all object types that are owned by anotherobject, the GetType service is used with the singleparameter of the object specifier of the owner. Theservice provider returns an error of Unknown objecttype if it has no types of owned objects.13.6 Determine Names of Attributes of SubordinateObjects  To determine the names of the attributes ofspecific objects owned by the service provider, theGetAttrName service is used with two parameters: theobject specifier of the owner and a list of the types ofthe target objects. The service provided returns an errorof Unknown object type if it has no types of ownedobjects. 14 Requirements for Compliance14.1 Object Services are common to all serviceresources that define public objects with operations forgetting (reading) and setting (writing) attribute valuesand for getting object types and attribute names forobjects. Object services provide common definitionsfor public objects and object services that may beincorporated into these service resources, therebyavoiding unnecessary duplication.14.2 Fundamental Requirements  All objectscompliant to any part of OSS shall be subtypes of thetop object. That is, they shall inherit (provide) theObjType and ObjID attributes as described in Section8.2.14.2.1 They shall provide documentation of theirpublic attributes in the form of an Object AttributeDefinition table as described in Section 5.2.14.2.2 They shall also provide the services GetAttr andSetAttr as defined in Section 11.5.

A1-1 Overview of Object TerminologyA1-1.1 This section provides an introduction to thebasic terminology for object models.A1-1.2 A model is an abstraction of a problem, a real-world phenomena, things, etc. for the purpose ofunderstanding it. A model typically is a simplificationthat omits nonessential details. Examples: architecturalscale models, behavioral state models.A1-1.3 An object is an entity (concept, abstraction, orreal world thing) with a particular behavior and withassociated properties (information, or attributes). Anobject type (class) refers to a group of objects that havecommon (1) properties (but not specific values), (2)behavior, (3) relationships with other objects, and (4)semantics (public interfaces). The term object may beused either to refer to a type of object or to a particularinstance of an object type.8 The notation used fordiagrams of objects used in this document is describedin Section A1-2.A1-1.4 An object model is a static graphic model ofobjects to show structure  the identity of objects, theirattributes and operations, and their relationships withone another.A1-1.5 An instance of an object is an instantiation ofan object type. For example, a specific installation ofequipment is an instance of the object typeEquipment.A1-1.6 Objects have items of associated informationcalled attributes. For example, for an objectEquipment, attributes of interest include themanufacturer, model, serial number, and a logical user-assigned name (nickname). Attributes used to uniquelyidentify a particular instance of an object type is calledan identifier. An object may have more than oneidentifier. Also, a set of more than one attribute may beused as an identifier. In the example of Equipment,name could be used as an identifier, and thecombination of manufacturer and serial number alsocould be an identifier.A1-1.7 Objects have operations that may be applied toor by an object type. Operations are functions ortransformations that are either performed by, or on, anobject. Operations of interest to Object Services areget (read) attributes, set (write) attributes, and get 8 The term object is used by some authors to only refer toinstances and by other authors as a synonym for object type. type. A service provides a service user with aninterface to the functionality of the operation.A1-1.8 A high-level model may show a particular typeof object with certain operations, while a more detailedmodel shows that a second type of object actuallyperforms one or more of the operations on the firstobject. As an example, a model might show a processprogram object with the operation delete, to showthat the delete operation is inherently associated withthe process program. A more detailed model mightshow that a process program manager actuallyperforms the operation of deleting a process program.A1-1.9 A method is an implementation of an operation(e.g., the software code that performs the operation).

OMT was developed by Rumbaugh,Blaha, et al., in Object Modeling and Design, PrenticeHall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, \xa91991. OMT has beenadopted by different standards to describe requirementsin terms of objects and relationships between objects.The purpose of this document is to provide adescription of OMT notation as a reference for suchSEMI standards and other SEMI documents.A1-2.2 Basic Notation  Figure A1-1 illustratesnotation for object type, showing object type, objectattributes, object operations, object instance, and therelationship between an object type and instance. FigureA1-2 provides an example.A1-2.2.1 Object types in OMT are shown as rectangles.The rectangle may be further subdivided into two orthree parts. The object type always appears at the top.Object attributes are shown in a second part of therectangle. Operations are shown in a third part of therectangle. High-level models often omit the operationssection and sometimes omit the attributes section.A1-2.2.2 The name of an attribute may be followed byadditional details, such as data type and initial value. A1-2.2.3 Instances of objects are shown as roundedrectangles. The instantiation relationship is shown by adotted arrow from an instance of an object type to thetype.A1-2-2.4 The example for an object type Equipmentis shown in Figure A1-2; here Etch01 is a specificreal-world installation of type Equipment.A1-2.3 Associations  An association describes a setof potential bi-directional relationships betweeninstances of objects. An association uses a formalstructure and semantics.A1-2.3.1 An association shows a specific multiplicityat both ends of the relationship. For example, a singlefactory manufacturing system may be associated withmany equipment (one-to-many). Possible multiplicitiesof association types are shown in Figure A1-3. Figure A1-3Multiplicities of Associations A1-2.3.2 Figure A1-4 shows an example of a one-to-one relationship. The name of the association (using averb) appears above the line connecting a pair ofobjects and describes the relationship that the object tothe left (or above) has to the object to the right (orbelow). Figure A1-4Association of Objects A1-2.3.3 The name of the role of each object withinthe relationship may be placed beneath the line and nearthat object. Role names are nouns. In the exampleabove, the roles might be supervisor andsubordinate. Role names are optional."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 34 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E39-0703 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2003 26 Figure A1-5Qualified Association A1-2.3.4 A qualified association, shown in Figure A1-5, uses a qualifier to reference an object. Qualifiersmay be shown to specify the identifier used by oneobject to associate with instances of the other object. IfType-1 object is Factory Host and Type-2 object isEquipment, a user-assigned name attribute may beused as a qualifier for the equipment.A1-2.3.5 Figure A1-6 illustrates a link object, wherelink attributes are placed in an object box that isattached to the association with a loop. A link objectmay be used to show attributes that are dependent onthe association between instances of one object type toinstances of another type. Figure A1-6Link Object A1-2.3.6 Figure A1-7 gives an example of a link objectfor the association Authorized On between anAuthorized User and Equipment. Figure A1-7Example of a Link Object A1-3 Generalization and InheritanceA1-3.1 Figure A1-8 shows the concept ofgeneralization. Generalization categorizes a set ofobject types and allows the abstraction of their commonfeatures into a supertype, with refinements of thesupertype shown as subtypes. The subtype may bethought of as a specialization of the supertype. For example, vehicle is a supertype with many subtypes,including aircraft, automobile, cart, and robot. Figure A1-8Non-Overlapping Subtypes A1-3.1.1 An instance of a subtype is also an instanceof its supertype. Attributes and operations of thesupertype are inherited by all the subtypes. That is, thesubtype has all of the same attributes and operations ofthe supertype, and in addition it adds attributes andoperations of its own.A1-3.1.2 The OMT notation for the generalization(supertype/subtype) relationship is shown by a solidtriangle. White triangles indicate that the subtypes arenon-overlapping; an instance of one subtype may not bean instance of another subtype.A1-3.1.3 The method for a subtype of an object mightbe different from that of the supertype or from adifferent subtype, perhaps due to more specializedknowledge that allowed a more efficientimplementation for the subtype. As an example, aGeometrical Figure object type might have theoperation draw. The methods for subtypes of circleand rectangle would differ, however.A1-3.1.4 Figure A1-10 gives an example of an agentas a generalization of various types of active entitiesthat might be found in a factory, and equipment as ageneralization of specific kinds of equipment.

The agent in this figure is a very general supertype of a factory system. Additional subtypes ofagents, not shown in the figure, could include cells, clusters, and cluster modules. Cells, with equipment ascomponents, and clusters, with modules as components, are examples of types of agents that are aggregatescomposed of other subtypes of agent.

It was availableat ",(0,o.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.semi.org"},"www.semi.org")," in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005. Originally published in 1995; last publishedJune 2003.1 Purpose1.1 Automated management and command of material processing in equipment is a crucial aspect enabling factoryautomation. This standard addresses the communications needs within the semiconductor manufacturingenvironment with respect to the processing of material in equipment.1.2 This standard specifies the application of the appropriate processing to specified material received at theprocessing agent. It describes the concepts of material processing, the behavior of the equipment in relation toprocessing, and the messaging services which are needed to accomplish the task.1.3 The communications services defined here enable standards-based interoperability of independent systems.They allow application software to be developed that can assume the existence of these services and allow softwareproducts to be developed which offer them.1.4 Implementation of automated processing management will help eliminate misprocessing of material. Theadoption of the standards described will greatly reduce the effort required to integrate compliant equipmentcomponents and reduce time to set up for processing. Compliance requires a minimal but specific set of standardservices. 2 Scope2.1 The scope of this standard is automated material processing based on discrete processing jobs. It provides thefunctionality required for process management for modules within a cluster tool. It may be applied to sub-systems ofother multi-resource equipment, as well as to host control of many types of equipment.2.2 This standard supports individual management of jobs for identical processing of material within a group andconcurrent processing of independent groups. Where material contains other material (such as carriers containingwafers), processing may be specified in terms of either material type.2.3 A simple tuning mechanism is provided for limited feedforward and feedback control between process steps. Amethod is defined for taking advantage of recipe variable parameters. This is not expected to satisfy all closed loopcontrol requirements. Other mechanisms are anticipated with greater flexibility for late tuning and handling complexdata.2.4 This standard does not provide services for receiving material for processing, or disposing of it after processingis complete. Automation of material transfer is assumed to be provided through other services, such as those definedin applicable SEMI standards.2.5 This standard presents a solution from the concepts and behavior down to the messaging services. It does notdefine the messaging protocol.2.6 A messaging service includes the identification that a message shall be exchanged and a definition of the datawhich is contained in that message. It does not include information on the structure of the message, how the data isrepresented within the message, or how the message is exchanged. This additional information is contained withinthe message protocol.2.7 The defined services may be applied to multiple protocols. Information on the mapping of processingmanagement services to special protocols (e.g., SECS-II) are added as adjunct standards.2.8 The services assume a communications environment in which a reliable connection has been establishedbetween the user of the services and the provider of the services. Establishing, maintaining, releasing a connection,and handling communication failures are beyond the scope of this standard."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 40 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E40-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2005 2 NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.

An overview of this notation is presented in an appendix of SEMI E30. The formal definition of thisnotation is presented in Science of Computer Programming 8, Statecharts: A Visual Formalism for ComplexSystems, by D. Harel, 1987.5.1.1 The Harel notation does not include the concept of creation and deletion of state models to representtransient entities. The job described in this document is such an entity, where each new job created uses a copy ofthe same state model. In this document, an oval is used to denote the creation of an entity and also the deletion ofthat entity.5.1.2 Transition tables are provided in conjunction with the state diagrams to describe explicitly the nature of eachstate transition. A transition contains columns for Transition #, Current State, Trigger, New State, Action(s). Thetrigger (column 3) for the transition occurs while in the current state. The actions (column 5) include acombination of (1) actions taken upon exit of the current state, (2) actions taken upon entry of the new state, and (3)actions taken which are most closely associated with the transition. No differentiation is made.5.1.3 The state models included in this standard are a requirement for Processing Management compliance. A statemodel consists of a state model diagram, state definitions, and a state transition table. When using SEMI E30, E53or similar style collection events, all state transitions in this standard, unless otherwise specified, shall correspond tocollection events.5.1.4 A state model represents the hosts view of the equipment, and does not necessarily describe the internalequipment operation. When using collection events, all Processing Management state model transitions shall bemapped sequentially into the appropriate internal equipment collection events that satisfy the requirements of those"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 42 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E40-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2005 4 transitions. In certain implementations, the equipment may enter a state and have already satisfied all of theconditions required by the Processing Management state models for transition to another state. In the case, theequipment makes the required transition without any additional actions in this situation.5.2 Object Attribute Representation  The object information models for standardized objects will be supported byan attribute definition table with the following column headings: Attribute Name Definition Access Requirement FormThe formal text name of the attribute. Description of the information contained. RO or RW Y or N (see below) 5.2.1 The Access column uses RO (Read Only) or RW (Read and Write) to indicate the access that service-usershave to the attribute.5.2.2 A Y or N in the requirement (Rqmt) column indicates if this attribute must be supported in order to meetfundamental compliance for the service.5.2.3 The Form column is used to indicate the format of the attribute. (See 4.1 for definitions.)5.3 Service Message Representation5.3.1 Service Resource Definition  A service resource definition table defines the specific set of messages for agiven service group, as shown in the following table: Message Service Name Type DescriptionMessage Name N or R The intent of the service. 5.3.1.1 Type can be either N = Notification or R = Request.5.3.1.2 Notification type messages are initiated by the service provider, and the provider does not expect to get aresponse from the consumer/subscriber.5.3.1.3 Request messages are initiated by a service consumer or subscriber. Request messages ask for data or anactivity from the provider. Request messages expect a specific response message (no presumption on the messagecontent).5.3.2 Service Parameter Dictionary  A service parameter dictionary table defines the parameters used in aservice, as shown in the following table: Parameter Form DescriptionParameter X Data Type A parameter called X is B in A. 5.3.2.1 A row is provided in the table for each parameter of the service. The first column contains the name of theparameter. This is followed by columns describing the form and contents of the corresponding primitive.5.3.2.2 The Form column is used to indicate the type of data contained in a parameter. (See 4.2 for definitions.)5.3.2.3 The Description column in the Service Parameter Dictionary table describes the meaning of the parameter,the values it can take on, and any inter-relationships with other parameters.5.3.2.4 To prevent the definition of numerous parameters named XxxList, this document adopts the convention ofreferring to the list as (List of) Xxx.

Its principlefunction is to ensure that material delivered to the processing resource is processed with the correct recipe. It definesthe services needed by a supervisor (service-user) to initiate and track processing of a particular material. It alsodefines commands which affect the processing operation.6.1.1 The processing resource is the entity which adds manufacturing value to the material. It may take severalforms, including the processing element of a cluster tool process module or the entity managing processing for acomplete stand-alone equipment. The processing agent is considered to be the provider of the processing services.6.1.2 Process management allows for pre-conditioning before material arrival and post-conditioning after materialdeparture. A simple tuning mechanism provides support for limited feedforward and feedback control. The tuning,applied at process initiation, sets recipe variable parameters.6.1.3 The services are fully defined in terms of the functionality provided by the processing agent (service-provider)and, as such, do not dictate the architecture of the supervisor (service-user).6.1.4 This standard describes the concepts and processing model on which the communications are based, followedby the detailed behavioral model used. It then describes the standard object attributes and message services in detail.6.2 Compliance  Compliance to this standard includes adherence to all stated requirements in this documentwhere implemented. Standard services are to be used where related functionality is required. This includes definedmessage services and state models.6.2.1 Some capabilities are not required to be supported for compliance, such as queuing, multiple concurrent jobs,material groups, manual start, pause/resume, and tuning. Required capabilities are indicated throughout thedocument and are also listed in the Fundamental Requirements section.6.2.2 A processing agent shall provide the funda-mental requirements, plus the set of optional services, appropriateto achieve effective processing management for the particular hardware architecture and automated processingrequirements. 7 Concepts7.1 Material Processing Model  Processing management ensures that the appropriate processing is applied to aparticular material by a processing resource through the definition of a process job. The process job provides a"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 44 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E40-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2005 6 widely applicable supervisory control capability for automated processing of material in equipment, irrespective ofthe particular process being used.7.1.1 This standard assumes that, given the material and the recipe specification, the processing resource is capableof independently achieving the required processing objectives.7.1.2 Processing management does not provide services for material movement, but the service-provider does needto coordinate its activities with regard to the receiving and sending of material, thereby maintaining system integrity.7.2 Process Job  The process job is a dynamic ob-ject specified by the process supervisor (service-user) to effectmaterial processing by the processing resource. The high-level job contains all the information required by theprocessing resource to achieve processing of the material, once it arrives, without further intervention by thesupervisor.7.2.1 The process job encompasses up to four sequential phases: processing resource pre-conditioning before material arrival, material and processing resource preparation for processing, material processing, and processing resource post-conditioning after material departure.7.2.2 The material processing phase is the only phase in which the material is altered and is the only required phase.7.2.3 This standard specifies services for the creation, control (pausing, aborting, etc.) and tracking of the processjob. It does not define the low-level control of processing since this is application-dependent. The processingresource performing a process job is responsible for doing whatever is appropriate to achieve its processingobjectives, as specified by the recipe and tuning parameters.7.2.4 The material specified in a process job may be the actual single material elements to be processed or acontainer, such as in the case of a cassette of wafers.7.2.5 The process job lifecycle may extend beyond the active processing of the material. It may exist from beforematerial arrival, through setup and processing, and until after material departure. This allows for materialprocessing-related pre-conditioning of the processing resource before the material is received and for processingresource post-conditioning (e.g., cleanup) after material is sent. Pre-conditioning and post-conditioning support isnot a fundamental requirement.7.2.6 The processing resource may provide process job queuing in order to offer flexibility in systems where workis pre-scheduled or the order of material arrival is unknown. Queuing is the acceptance of multiple process jobs inadvance of performing the processing activities. Queuing is generally needed to support more complex systemsrequiring concurrent and consecutive jobs (see below). The jobs are listed in the queue in the order created.Execution order may be significant, such as consecutive jobs on the same material. Queuing is not a fundamentalrequirement.7.3 Relation to Material Movement  Processing Management does not provide services for receiving material intothe processing agent domain for processing or sending the material away after processing is complete.7.3.1 Processing depends on the presence of the material, and material departure depends on process completion.There is also an interdependency requiring synchronization with material movement if processing resource pre-conditioning and post-conditioning are applied. The equipment is responsible for maintaining integrity betweenmaterial transfer and processing.7.3.2 Material movement management is outside the scope of this standard but may be achieved using applicableSEMI standards.7.4 Processing Description  The description of the processing to be applied by the Process Job is crucial. Thedescription may be supplied in the form of a Process Recipe (see SEMI E42) or a Process Program (see SEMI E30).This specification will define mes-sages referencing only Process Recipes. Where there are special considerationsfor using Process Programs instead of a Process Recipe, they will be noted."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 45 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E40-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 20057 7.4.1 The process job includes a processing descrip-tion (a recipe or process program) identifier that shall be uniquewithin the domain of the processing agent. The type and content of the processing description must be appropriatefor the processing resource and the type of material.7.4.2 Creation and management of recipes and process programs is outside the scope of this standard.7.5 Process Tuning  Feedforward and feedback control between process steps is becoming increasingly importantfor process tuning in stabilizing processes, such as those which lack in-situ metrology, and demand increasing yields(or performance). The process tuning requirements differ considerably with application, and there is little consensuson any particular method. It is not the intention of this standard to provide compre-hensive support for processtuning, but rather to provide a simple mechanism which may be extended. Support for recipe tuning is not afundamental requirement.7.5.1 Processing management provides a mechanism for specification of the type of recipe method to be applied.Two methods are defined in the standard: RecipeID only, and RecipeID and Variables. User-defined methods mayalso be used, requiring all com-municating entities to have a common understanding of the particular definition andapplication requirements.7.5.2 The RecipeID only method accepts the identifier of the recipe to be applied but no additional tuningparameters. The application recipe body is not precluded from defining any application tuning, but there is nostandardized support.7.5.3 The RecipeID and Variables method provides a simple process tuning mechanism at process job creation tosupport limited run to run feedforward and feedback control. It defines the VariableTuning method, which supplies alist of variable names and values in the process job create. This sets variables defined in the recipe. Each variablename shall be one of the exposed variable definitions supported in recipe management, and its value shall fall withinthe range specified in the variable definition.7.5.4 Recipe parameter names (RecipeVarName) shall be specified using the nomenclature defined for ObjectSpecification (ObjSpec) in SEMI E39 (Object Services Standard) within the scope of SEMI E40 (Note: seeOBJSPEC in SEMI E5). This use of the ObjSpec nomenclature is required to unambiguously identify parameterswithin some complex recipes (e.g., cluster tool process recipes). If the specification of a recipe parameter isunambiguous, then the form of the ObjSpec may be simplified to just the parameter name. Using the ObjSpecnomenclature for SEMI E40 recipe parameter names requires an object model to describe equipment recipestructure.7.5.5 Figure 1 shows an example of a typical set of cluster tool hierarchical recipe relationships. A processingparameter might be specified through Sequence Step AB, Process Recipe BB, Process Step CB, to ProcessParameter DB.

A single process job can control a group of material, with certain restrictions. All material in the groupneeds to be of the same type and processed identically. The processing of each material should be dependent on thearrival of the group. That is, the full material group shall be received by the equipment before processing begins andmay not depart until all processing is complete. This ensures that the process job remains a simple logical controlmechanism while maintaining robust control, good coordination with material movement, and effective materialdata tracking.7.6.1 Two common examples of allowable material group processing are:a) an equipment receiving a cassette of wafers to be processed identically. All the wafers in the group are receivedtogether, in the cassette. The processing of the wafers may or may not be simultaneous but can only proceedonce the cassette has arrived. All wafer processing shall complete before the cassette may be removed. Notethat this may alternatively be specified as a simple process job with the cassette as the material; andb) a cluster tool batch process module processing wafers together. Wafers are received singly. Processing of thewafer group in the batch chamber begins when all the wafers specified in the process job have arrived. Wafersare sent after processing is complete.7.7 Concurrent Process Jobs  Concurrent process jobs is the situation where multiple jobs are active (not queued)at the same time. A single process job is not always appropriate for concurrent processing of multiple material. Insuch cases, multiple concurrent jobs shall be supported by the processing resource. Support of concurrent processjobs is not a fundamental requirement.7.7.1 An example of concurrent wafer processing which may not be achieved with a single process job is a carouseltype cluster tool process module. The processing of a single wafer is not dependent on the arrival of the group. Inthis case, concurrent process jobs would be created, one for each wafer, even if they were to be processedidentically. This allows effective control and tracking of the process jobs.7.7.2 Processing management considers concurrent process jobs to be logically independent of one other. They aredistinguished by unique job identifiers. Concurrent jobs may not apply to the same material because the processingresource may not have more than one active process job associated with a particular material.7.7.3 There may be interdependencies between concurrent jobs due to resource availability and equipment hardwarearchitecture."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 47 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E40-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 20059 7.8 Consecutive Process Jobs  Consecutive process jobs is a situation where multiple process jobs are applied tomaterial while it is in the processing resource. The process jobs requested on the same material are maintained in theorder received, and a subsequent job becomes active once the previous one has completed material processing.7.8.1 A process job normally specifies all the processing to be applied to the material during a single visit to theprocessing resource. For example, a process job for a cluster tool would specify all the processing in the multiplesequential steps in the various process modules of the tool. Certain situations may require application of subsequentprocess jobs to material without it leaving the processing resource.7.8.2 Processing management requires that a subsequent process job on the same material does not interrupt theprevious process job processing. The previous process job terminates immediately once it completes active materialprocessing, even though the material has not left the processing resource, and it is superceded by the subsequent job.The material becomes associated with the superceding process job. This allows sequential processing and maintainsa single active association between material and process job.7.9 Process Job without Material  This standard is primarily intended for the management of material processing.However, it permits application of a process job to a processing resource which contains no processing material.This may be used to achieve processing resource conditioning which is not related to a specific material.7.9.1 The process job has the normal control characteristics, except that it has no dependency on material arrivaland terminates at the end of active processing. Support of process jobs without material is not a fundamentalrequirement. 8 Behavior8.1 This section provides a high-level definition of the communications between the supervisor and the processingresource needed to achieve material processing. It does not define the message detail, concentrating instead on theconcepts. The message detail is addressed in 10, Messaging Services.8.2 Process Job Communications8.2.1 Process Job Control Messaging  The control message flow for normal operation is presented in Figure 1.The arrows represent significant information exchange.8.2.1.1 A detailed description of each message used in normal operation follows.8.2.1.2 PR Job Create  The supervisor requests that the processing resource perform the specified process job.This request may be acted upon immediately, or queued for later execution if the processing resource is busy or theorder of material arrival unknown. If the processing resource does not support queuing or the queue is full, therequest may be rejected. The request shall supply a process specification in which the supervisor supplies suchinformation as: identification of the material to be processed, the recipe defining the processing, and whether processing will be started manually (optional, normal operation is automatic).8.2.1.2.1 Upon receipt of the PR Job Create request and before acknowledging, the processing resource checks theprocess specifications to ensure that they are valid (i.e., that the specified parameters (recipe, material, manual start)are sufficient) and have legal values for the capabilities of the processing resource. Depending on its ability to queuejobs, it may also check such dynamic information as availability of the processing resource to receive the material orpresence of correct material, etc., to determine whether to accept or reject.8.2.1.2.2 The processing resource sets the process start attribute if automatic start is requested (normal operation).8.2.1.3 PR Job Create Acknowledge  The processing resource informs the supervisor that the requested job isaccepted or rejected, and if rejected, supplies error codes and textual reasons for the failure.8.2.1.4 PR Job Setup  The processing resource reports that the process job is active and setting up for process. Itmay have been on the queue or have just been created. If the material is not already present, the processing resourceperforms any pre-conditioning required then awaits material arrival. Upon arrival of all the material, it prepares forprocessing and automatically initiates processing if the process start attribute is set."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 48 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E40-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2005 10 PROCESSING AGENT SUPERVISORPR JOB CREATE PR JOB CREATE ACK PR JOB SETUP PR JOB PROCESSING PR JOB PROC COMPLETE PR JOB COMPLETE pre-conditioning,material arrivalprocessingthe materialmaterial departure,post-conditioning queued Figure 2Process Job Message Flow 8.2.1.5 PR Job Processing  The processing resource reports that material processing has commenced.8.2.1.6 PR Job Processing Complete  The processing resource reports that material processing is completed andthat the material is available for removal.8.2.1.7 PR Job Complete  The processing resource declares the process job to be complete once it has completedprocessing the material, the material has departed, and any required processing resource post-conditioning hascompleted. This message is also used when a process job ends abnormally. The message provides information on thesuccess or failure of the processing and, if failed, supplies error codes and textual reasons for the failure.8.2.2 Process Job Informational Events  There are process job related events which may be of significance to theservice-user. These are designated as collection events and shall be available for event reporting. This sectiondescribes those collection events and shows how they fit into the chronology of a process job. These collectionevents, as specified by the PRJobEvent service, shall be implemented per definition of one of the followingstandards, SEMI E30, SEMI E40, SEMI E53 or similar style events, as required by the service-user. The equipmentmay also optionally implement the collection events per the remaining standards. However, the service-user shallonly utilize one of the standards for collection event implementations. The selection mechanism by the service-useris equipment specific. For example, it may be part of an equipment power-on process or via an equipment specificequipment constant.8.2.2.1 If SEMI E30, SEMI E53 or similar style collection events are used for PRJobEvent, the equipment may alsoimplement equivalent events for the process job milestones as defined by the PRJobAlert service.8.2.2.2 Collection event messages provide valuable information but are not strictly required to perform materialprocessing. Therefore, it is expected that some message protocol implementations will provide a method by whichthe service-user may disable those events which are not needed in a particular implementation. For SEMI E40 styleevents, the activation for disabling the events is user specific. For SEMI E30, SEMI E53 or similar style events, theactivation is as defined in those standards.8.2.2.3 PR Job Waiting for Material  The processing resource reports that all required pre-conditioning hascompleted and that it cannot proceed until the process job material arrives. It is considered to be awaiting materialarrival if it is not aware of activities in progress with the aim of receiving all or part of the material. This event maybe generated only during process job setup. This event requires, at a minimum, PRJobID and Timestamp as its data.8.2.2.4 PR Job State Change  The processing resource reports that it has changed state. All state transitions in thestate model Figure 4 shall trigger this collection event. These events require, at a minimum, variables PRJobID,PRJobState, and TimeStamp (SEMI E30).8.2.3 Process Job Extended Messaging  In this section, the extended messaging of Abort/Stop/Cancel,Pause/Resume and manual Start Process is added to the normal messaging described above. The only extendedfunctionality required to be supported in processing management is Abort.8.2.3.1 A detailed description of each message used in extended operation follows."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 49 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E40-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 200511 8.2.3.2 PR Job Abort  The supervisor may command the processing resource to abort a process job at any time.The goal of the abort command is to end the process job activities as quickly as possible. This includes halting allprocessing of material in progress, which may result in an unknown material condition. Abort is intended for usewhen serious problems are detected and further damage needs to be prevented. The abort command terminates theprocess job. In many cases, error recovery may be required before normal operation may continue and subsequentjobs can be executed. For processing equipment a part of the error recovery procedure may require the removal ofsubstrates belonging to the aborted process job that still reside in the equipment. This is determined by theprocessing agent, which may use applicable service standards to handle the exception.8.2.3.2.1 The abort command takes precedence over the stop, cancel, and pause commands. If the specified processjob is queued, the abort command acts identically to a cancel command.8.2.3.3 PR Job Stop  The supervisor may command the processing resource to stop a process job at any time. Thestop command terminates the job in an orderly manner. The object of the stop command is to cease the currentactivity at the next safe, convenient point, preserving material integrity. In the situation of processing equipment,this convenient point may require that all related substrates are sent to their output destination. This implies that eachmaterial is either processed as specified in the recipe or not at all. As stop terminates the job, a new process job isneeded to continue processing the material in the processing resource. If restart of the same job is needed, pause andresume should be used instead of stop. A new job is required if additional processing is needed after a job is stopped.8.2.3.3.1 If the specified process job is queued, the stop command acts identically to a cancel command.8.2.3.4 PR Job Cancel  The supervisor may cancel a process job which has not yet become active (e.g., a jobwhich is queued). Cancel is used when the supervisor would like to remove a process job  to reschedule, forexample  but does not want to affect process job activities already in-progress. A cancelled job is removed fromthe queue and ceases to exist. No physical action is associated with canceling a process job. If the specified processjob is active, the processing resource shall reject this command.8.2.3.5 PR Job Pause  The supervisor may issue a command to pause a process job at any time. A pausecommand shall cause the processing resource to continue to the first safe, continual, pausing place and then ceaseactivity. The activity may cease only at points that allow for resumption of the activity (see the resume command)such that material integrity is maintained and the processing goals are accomplished. Note that a paused process jobmay be aborted or stopped as an alternative to the resume command. In this case, the stop command may cause theequivalent of a resume in order to ensure material integrity (either fully processed or not processed at all) upontermination of the process job.8.2.3.6 PR Job Resume  The resume command is used to continue a previously paused process job activity.8.2.3.7 PR Job Create  The PR Job Create request as previously described is for normal automatic process joboperation. If the process start attribute is not set, the processing resource waits for a manual start from the supervisorbefore processing the material. The control message flow for manual start is presented in Figure 3.8.2.3.8 PR Job Waiting for Start  The processing resource is ready to process once the material has arrived andhas been prepared for processing. The processing resource reports that it is ready to process and is waiting for start,if the process job PRProcessStart attribute is not set. The PRProcessStart attribute is not set if the job is defined tostart manually and the start command has not yet been received. The WAITING FOR START state shall be a safecondition which maintains material integrity. If the process job is stopped or aborted while in this state, the materialwill not have been altered.8.2.3.9 PR Job Start Process  The supervisor which has defined a process job to start manually issues a PR JobStart Process to allow processing of the material to proceed when the processing resource is ready. The start may beissued at any time after process job creation. On receiving the start command, the processing resource sets theprocess start attribute and starts processing if it is already in the WAITING FOR START state."),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"<","!-- Page 50 --",">"),(0,o.yg)("p",null,"SEMI E40-0705 \xa9 SEMI 1995, 2005 12 Figure 3Manual Start Message Flow 8.2.3.10 PR Job Start Acknowledge  The processing resource responds to the supervisor that the requested startprocess is accepted or rejected and, if rejected, supplies errorcodes and textual reasons for failure.8.3 Process Job State Model  The process job is a transient entity. It is created on request of the supervisor,executes, and then is deleted by the processing resource. The job usually spans the time period from shortly beforematerial is physically delivered to the processing resource, through the processing, and until shortly after material istaken away.8.3.1 Process Job State Model Diagram  Figure 4 shows the Process Job State Model diagram.8.3.2 Process Job State Descriptions  The detailed state definitions follow.8.3.2.1 ABORTING (ACTIVE Substate)  While the PR Job is in the ABORTING substate, the processing resourceis performing an abort or an optional error recovery procedure. The abort procedure will cause immediatetermination of the processing. It is the responsibility of the processing resource to cease physical activity as quicklyas possible, having achieved a safe condition.NOTE 1: For processing equipment the termination may have to be followed by an error recovery procedure with whichremaining substrates can be brought to the output destination.8.3.2.2 ACTIVE  ACTIVE is the parent state of all substates where the context of an active process job executionexists.8.3.2.3 EXECUTING (ACTIVE Substate)  EXECUTING is the parent state of those substates that refer to thepreparation and execution of a process job.8.3.2.4 SETTING UP (EXECUTING Substate)  While the PR Job is in the SETTING UP substate, the processingresource performs pre-conditioning, awaits material arrival, and prepares for material processing. Pre-conditioningincludes all operations in the processing resource, which are required by the recipe in advance of material arrival.8.3.2.4.1 In cases where the material is already present, it is simply prepared for processing. If pre-conditioning(without material present) is required to achieve the processing goals specified by the recipe, the job fails andterminates.8.3.2.5 PAUSE (ACTIVE Substate)  While the PR Job is in the PAUSE substate the processing resource issuspending or has suspended activity.")))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
