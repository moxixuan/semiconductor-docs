adhesive  tape  as  received  from  the  vendor,
laminate and cure it according to the method
described in Section 8.2. In addition, remove
all  copper  foil  by  etching,  and  dry  for  30
minutes at 80 ± 5°C. As shown in Figure 5,</p><p>SEMI G76-0299 © SEMI 1999 11
use  a  sample  with  a  length  of  200  mm  and
width  of  50  mm,  and  mark  a  line  in  the  TD
direction  at  125  mm  from  the  bottom.  With
the   mark   line   facing   outward,   wrap   the
sample  around  the  pole  and  hold  in  place
with tape within 76 mm about the mark line.
Remove  the  pole  to  leave  a  tube  of  the
sample. Prepare 2 groups of 5 pieces each.
(3) Preparation   Leave  one  group  of  samples
in  normal  condition  for  48  hours.  Heat  the
other group at 70 ± 1°C for 168 hours, place
them   in   the   dessicator   with   dehydrated
hydrated  calcium  and  keep  for  more  than  4
hours at 23°C.
(4)    Test   Perform  the  following  test  on  the
two groups of samples prepared as described
in Section 8.7.6, (3) above:
(a)  As  shown  in  Figure  6,  fix  the  sample
perpendicular  in  the  ring  stand  with  the
clamps,  with  the  tip  of  the  burner  10
mm  below  the  edge  of  the  sample,  and
the  absorbent  cotton  placed  horizontal
at 300 mm below the edge.
(b)  Light  the  burner  away  from  the  sample,
and adjust to a blue flame of 20 ± 1 mm
long. Keeping the length at 20 ± 1 mm,
make  sure  there  is  no  yellow  flame  at
the tip.
(c) Apply the flame to the center of the edge
of   the   sample   for   3   seconds.   Then
remove the flame to more than 150 mm
away,   and   record   the   flaming   time.
When  the  flame  burns  out,  apply  the
flame  to  the  edge  of  the  sample  for  3
seconds  and  pull  away  again.  Measure
the  flaming  time  it  takes  to  reach  the
clamp   as   well   as   the   glowing   time.
Also,   record   whether   the   absorbent
cotton  has  caught  fire  or  not.  When
there  are  molten  particles  or  burning
material drippings from the sample, it is
acceptable  to  tip  the  burner  45°  and
move the flame from the bottom edge to
avoid  material  dripping  on  the  burner.
In   this   case,   the   distance   from   the
bottom  edge  of  the  sample  to  the  tip  of
the burner should still be 10 mm.

SPECIFICATION FOR FRAME CASSETTE FOR 300 MM WAFERS
This test method was technically approved by the Global Assembly &amp; Packaging Committee and is the direct
responsibility  of  the  Japanese  Packaging  Committee.  Current  edition  approved  by  the  Japanese  Regional
Standards  Committee  on  March  17,  1999.    Initially  available  at  <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a>  May  1999;  to  be  published
June 1999.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1   The  purpose  of  this  document   is  to  specify  the
mechanical features for a 300 mm wafer frame cassette
used  between  the  wafer  mounting  process  and  the  die-
bonding process.
2  Scope</li><li>1   This  standard  is  intended  to  se t  an  appropriate
level  of  specification  that  places  minimal  limits  on
innovation       while       ensuring       modularity       and
interchangeability at all mechanical interfaces.</li><li>2  Only the physical interfaces fo r the frame cassette
are   specified;   no   materials   requirements   or   micro-
contamination    limits    are    given.    However,    this
specification  was  written  to  allow  for  both  metal  and
plastic frame cassette designs.</li><li>3   This  specification  defines  a  30 0  mm  wafer  frame
cassette that is intended for both manual and automated
transport.    The    frame    cassette    has    the    following
components   and   sub-components   (“  ”   indicates   an
optional component):</li><li>3.1  Top
robotic handling flange (optional)</li></ol><ul><li>top cover</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>3.2  Interior</li></ol><ul><li>frame supports for 13 or 25 tape frames</li><li>frame restraint</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>3.3  Sides
human handles (optional)</li><li>3.4  Rear</li></ol><ul><li>rear cover</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>3.5  Bottom</li></ol><ul><li>2 bottom conveyor rails running along the
sides of the frame cassette
3 features that mate with kinematic coupling
pins and provide a 10 mm lead-in (optional)
4 frame cassette sending pads (optional)

4  Terminology</li><li>1   bilaterial  datum  plane
 a  ve rtical  plane  that
bisects the tape frames and that is perpendicular to both
the  horizontal  and  facial  datum  planes  (as  defined  in
SEMI E57).</li><li>2   conveyor  rails
 parallel  surf aces  on  the  bottom
of  the  cassette  for  supporting  the  cassette  on  roller
conveyors.</li><li>3  facial datum plane  a vertica l plane that bisects
the  tape  frames  and  that  is  parallel  to  the  front  side  of
the  frame  cassette  (where  tape  frames  are  removed  or
inserted).  On  tool  load  ports,  it  is  also  parallel  to  the
load  face  plane  specified  in  SEMI  E15  on  the  side  of
the   tool   where   the   frame   cassette   is   loaded   and
unloaded (as defined in SEMI E57).</li><li>4  frame cassette  an open stru cture that holds one
or more tape frames.</li><li>5  horizontal datum plane  a ho rizontal plane from
which  projects  the  kinematic  coupling  pins  on  which
the  frame  cassette  sits.  On  tool  load  ports,  it  is  at  the
load  height  specified  in  SEMI  E15  and  might  not  be
physically  realized  as  a  surface  (as  defined  in  SEMI
E57).</li></ol><p>SEMI G77-0699 © SEMI 19992
4. 6   robotic  handling  flange   hor izontal  projection
on  the  top  of  the  frame  cassette  for  lifting  and  rotating
the frame cassette.
4. 7   tape  frame   the  frame  which   applies  the  wafer
tape to the wafer and retains the wafer.
4. 8   wafer  tape   an  adhesive  plas tic  tape  which
retains  the  wafer  or  diced  chip.  It  is  used  between  the
mounting process and die-bonding process.
5  Ordering Information
5. 1   Intended  use   This  documen t  is  intended  to
specify    300    mm    wafer    frame    cassettes    over    a
reasonable   lifetime   of   use,   not   just   those   in   new
condition.   For   this   reason,   the   purchaser   needs   to
specify a time period as well as the number and type of
uses to which the frame cassettes will be put. It is under
these conditions that the frame cassettes must remain in
compliance with the requirements listed in Section 6.
6  Requirements
6. 1  Dimensions  The frame cass ette dimensions are
shown  in  Figures  1  through  5  and  listed  in  Table  1.  In
all  figures,  the  heaviest  lines  are  used  for  surfaces  that
have  tolerances  (not  surfaces  that  have  only  maximum
or only minimum dimensions).
6. 2  Tape Frame Orientation  Th e tape frames must
be  horizontal  when  the  frame  cassette  is  placed  on  the
load port.
6. 3   Center  of  Tape  Frames    Wh en  a  tape  frame  is
stored in the frame cassette, the center of the tape frame
should be within the radius of 2 mm from the center of
the junction of the bilaterial datum plane and the facial
datum plane.
6. 4  Top and Rear Covers  Both  top and rear covers
are   required.   With   the   covers   in   place,   the   frame
cassette must conform to all dimensions listed in Table</p><h1>1</h1><ol><li></li><li>5   Number  of  Slots   The  frame   cassette  has  an
option of either 13 or 25 slots.</li><li>6   Kinematic  Couplings  (optiona l)   The  physical
alignment  mechanism  from  the  frame  cassette  to  the
tool  load  port  (or  a  nest  on  a  vehicle  or  in  a  stocker)
consists  of  features  (not  specified  in  this  document)  on
the   top   entity   that   mate   with   three   or   six   pins
underneath   as   defined   in   SEMI   E57.   Most   of   the
dimensions  of  the  frame  cassette  are  determined  with
respect to the three orthogonal datum planes defined in
that  standard:  the  Horizontal  Datum  Plane,  the  facial
datum plane, and the bilateral datum plane.</li><li>6.1   The  three  features  that  mate  w ith  the  pins  must
provide   a   lead-in   capability   that   corrects   a   frame
cassette misalignment of up to 10 mm in any horizontal
direction,   although   15   mm   is   recommended   for
ergonomic  reasons.  However,  it  is  recommended  that
robotics placing cassettes on kinematic couplings use as
little of this lead-in capability as possible to avoid wear.</li><li>7  Human Handles (optional)    All  handles  for  use
by   humans   must   either   be   contained   within   the
maximum  outer  dimensions  of  the  frame  cassette,  be
detached  when  not  in  use,  or  be  retractable  into  the
maximum  outer  dimensions  when  not  in  use.  Handles
for  use  by  humans  (if  present)  must  follow  SEMI  S8
and  shall  require  the  use  of  both  hands  (each  using  a
full  wrap-around  grip,  given  the  minimum  clearance
requirement   in   SEMI   E15.1).   Automation   handling
features shall not be considered for dual purpose unless
they are designed to meet SEMI S8.</li><li>8  Robotic Handling Flange (opt ional)  On the top
of  the  frame  cassette  is  an  optional  robotic  handling
flange for manipulating the frame cassette.</li><li>9   Bottom  Rails   On  the  bottom   of  the  frame
cassette  are  two  rails,  one  on  each  side  for  use  with
roller conveyors.</li><li>10   Frame  Restraint   The  frame   cassette  must
provide   a   feature   that   prevents   tape   frames   from
slipping out of the cassette during transport. The feature
must conform to all dimensions listed in Table 1.</li><li>11    Frame   Cassette   Sensing   Pads ( optional) 
When  the  cassette  is  fully  down,  the  frame  cassette
sensing  pads  (see  Figure  5)  must  be  z2  above  the
horizontal  datum  plane.  It  is  recommended  that  the
areas surrounding all of the frame cassette sensing pads
be  designed  in  conjunction  with  the  features  that  mate
with  the  kinematic  coupling  pins  so  that  a  mechanical
sensor  pin  cannot  interfere  with  the  lead-in  function  of
the kinematic couplings.</li><li>12    Cassette   Stacking   (optional)      The   frame
cassette  may  have  optional  features  to  allow  two  13
capacity  cassettes  to  be  stacked  on  top  of  each  other.
This  option  is  only  available  for  cassettes  without  a
robotic handling flange.</li></ol><p>SEMI G77-0699 © SEMI 19993

TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE
SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS
This test method was technically approved by the Global Automated Test Equipment Committee and is
the direct responsibility of the North American Automated Test Equipment Committee. Current edition
approved  by  the  North  American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  December  18,  1998.    Initially
available at <a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> April 1999; to be published June 1999.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1   To  define  the  terms  and  provid e  a  means  of
comparative, or relative measurement for the automated
wafer  prober  functions:  Accuracy,  Repeatability  and
Throughput.
2  Scope</li><li>1    This   method   may   be   used   to   ev aluate   the
performance of a single automated wafer prober, or as a
means to compare many probers.  The probers that this
document addresses are defined as fully automated; that
is,  having  automatic  material  handling,  alignment  and
probing capabilities.
3  Limitations</li><li>1  This test and comparison meth od is not intended to
represent   a   statistically   complete   methodology   for
measuring   the   performance   of   an   automated   wafer
prober.  Its  correct  use  is  a  practical  means  to  compare
the  stepping  capabilities  of  wafer  probers  within  a
specific end user’s environment.</li><li>2   The  definitions  of  the  terms  “R epeatability”  and
“Accuracy”   as   used   in   this   document   are   not   in
accordance  with  those  of  the  National  Conference  of
Standards Laboratories (NCSL) nor are they intended to
be.  They  are  to  be  used  solely  for  the  purpose  of  this
document and have no other intended uses.</li><li>3   It  is  difficult  to  characterize  an d  eliminate  high
temperature  contributions  to  positional  error  such  as
probe    needle    ‘float’.        Therefore,    it    is    strongly
recommended  that  the  same  probe  card  be  used  to
evaluate all of the probers being considered.</li><li>4  It is recommended that the pro be card is verified to
be  in  the  same  condition  (i.e.  evaluated  for  positional
accuracy  and  overall  functional  condition)  both  before
and after the conclusion of each test.</li><li>5   Bump  placement  on  a  semicon d uctor  device  is
generally located ± 0.001&quot; with respect to their nominal
location.    Vertical  probe  cards  used  to  probe  bumps
have an inherent amount of needle drift.  Therefore care
must  be  exercised  in  using  vertical  probe  cards  on
bump    devices    as    a    means    of    prober    accuracy
measurement.

σ  limit — a statistically deriv ed measurement of
process   variation.      A   process   that   allows   a   ±   3σ
deviation will allow 2.7 parts per thousand to be outside
the established bounds.</li><li>2  accuracy  —  the  ability  of  an  a utomatic  wafer
prober  to  index  its  chuck,  and  attached  wafer,  from  an
initial   position   to   a   subsequent   position   and   make
contact  with  a  static  probe  tip  at  a  nominal  location  on
the  wafer.  In  the  context  of  this  method,  accuracy  is
defined as average die offset.</li><li>2.1   Average  die  offset  is  the  perpe ndicular  distance
measured from the centerline of the die pad to a parallel
line  that  statistically  represents  the  scrub  mark  data
point distribution center (see Figure 1). Each data point
shown in this figure represents only the center value of
accumulated scrub marks produced by operation of this
method.</li><li>2.2   It  should  be  noted  that  accurac y  established  by
this  method  is  characteristic  of  the  system,  which  in
total represents both the automated prober as well as its
probe   card.   Finally,   this   method   establishes   two
accuracy  values,  a  value  for  pads  along  the  X  and  Y
axes of the die. These axis directions are arbitrary.</li><li>2.3  It should be noted that if fully  automated prober
set-up   modes   are   not   used   for   probe-needle-to-pad
alignment  during  testing,  the  possibility  of  operator
error   should   be   considered   as   a   variable   when
evaluating system accuracy.</li><li>3  automatic    wafer    prober    —    dev ice    that

pads or interconnect bumps on a semiconductor device
to a set of test needles attached to a probe card.
5. 4  bonding pad — exposed metal lic contact area on a
semiconductor  device  that  is  surrounded  by  dielectric
passivation.    This  is  the  point  at  which  a  temporary
interconnect is made for wafer level test, and permanent
interconnect for packaging.
5. 5  bumps —  metallic  elevated  co ntact  area  on  a
semiconductor device that is used in place of a bonding
pad.      A   die   that   is   designed   to   use   this   type   of
connection  is  commonly  called  a  ‘flip  chip’  or  direct
chip attach.
5. 6  die —  individual  semiconduct or  device.    For  the
purposes   of   this   method,   the   dice   have   not   been
singulated,  and  are  still  in  the  form  of  a  wafer.    Used
interchangeably  (in  the  context  of  wafer  sort)  with  the
acronym DUT (Device Under Test).
5. 7  overdrive —  distance  in  Z  whi ch  the  wafer  is
driven   beyond   a   user   defined   initial   contact   point,
typically ‘first electrical contact’.
5. 8  overhead test — semiconducto r test method where
the  test  head  is  mounted  directly  over  the  prober,  with
the  goal  of  shortening  the  distance  between  the  pin
electronics   and   the   probe   card.      The   connection
between   the   test   head   and   the   prober   is   generally
through a device called a Prober Tester Interface (PTI)
5. 9  pin  electronics  —  tester  hardw are  that  creates  the
test signals used to challenge the DUT.
5. 10  probe  card  —  printed  wiring  b oard  or  ceramic
substrate with permanently attached needles or contacts
that are aligned at the time of manufacture to match the
contact pattern on a Die.  Common types of probe cards
are:
• Blade
• Peripheral / Cantilever (AKA Epoxy Ring)
• Vertical (AKA Area Array or Cobra™)
5. 11  probe  card  planarity  and  align ment  —  a  user-
specified position of the probe tips in ‘x’, ‘y’ and ‘z’.
5. 12  probe  needles  —  the  contact  p oints  between  the
probe  card  and  the  bonding  pads.    These  are  typically
manufactured from one of the following materials:
• Beryllium copper
• Tungsten
• Tungsten-rhenium alloy
• Paliney
5. 13  prober    tester    interface    (PTI)    —    signal-
transmitting  electro-mechanical  device  that  connects
the pin cards in the tester to the probe card.
5. 14  repeatability —  Figure  1  is  em pirical  data  and
represents  a  statistically  significant  sample  of  scrub
marks.  This  data  reveals  that  probe  needles  may  not
make  contact  consistently  to  the  same  point  die  to  die.
Recall   that   accuracy   is   defined   in   this   method   as
average die offset. Thus, repeatability simply represents
the three-sigma distribution value for average die offset.
Repeatability  will  represent  99.7%  or  a  three-sigma
distribution value for the accumulated offset data points
obtained through use of this method.

5. 14.1  The X-Y plotted centroids of t hese scrub marks
will be found to form a “cloud” of points, densest in the
center, and thinning out towards the edges.
5. 14.2   Repeatability  is  the  radius  of  th at  cloud  or
“cluster” of probe marks, as defined by the 3 σ or other
user  defined  limit  of  that  cloud.    The  error  in  the
placement  of  the  center  of  that  cloud,  relative  to  its
nominal   target,   is   defined   as   the   automatic   wafer
prober’s “Accuracy”. (See Figure 1)
5. 15  set point — the value to which  a control system’s
input device has been set, as opposed to the actual value
to  which  the  control  system  has  driven  the  controlled
variable.    For  example,  the  input  setting  to  the  wafer
chuck  temperature  controller,  as  opposed  to  the  actual,
independently   measured   temperature   of   the   wafer
chuck.
5. 16  soak time — time between a p iece of equipment’s
reaching the set point temperature and use of that piece
of equipment.</p><p>SEMI G78-0699 © SEMI 19993
5. 17  scrub  mark  — mark left by the probe in the
bonding  pad  or  bump  after  the  probe  card  has  touched
down on the wafer.
5. 18  temperature  testing  —  testing   of  devices  at  a
controlled temperature level other than ambient.
5. 19  test  —  one  complete  run-throu gh  of  the  data
collection  portion  of  this  document  on  one  automated
wafer prober.
5. 20  tester —  specialized  computer   controlled  system
designed to test integrated circuits.
5. 21  prober  communications  protoc ol  (see  Section
9. 6) —  means  of  transmitting  data  between  the  tester
and the prober.  Common methods are:
• TTL
• RS-232c
• GPIB
5. 22  test  head  —  package  of  electro nics  (part  of  the
Tester)     which     interacts     both     electrically     and
mechanically with the probe card, typically through the
Prober Tester Interface (PTI).
5. 23  throughput — rate at which di e can be cycled, by
the  automatic  wafer  prober,  for  the  purpose  of  being
tested.  It is inherent in the functionality of an automatic
wafer   prober   (or   any   other   motorized   positioning
device)  that  accuracy,  repeatability  and  throughput  are
intimately and inseparably related.
5. 24  touch  down  —  contact  betwee n  the  probe  card
and  the  wafer.    This  user  may  choose  to  define  this  as
either first electrical or first mechanical contact.
5. 25  wafer —  semiconductor  substr ate  upon  which
multiple die are fabricated.
5. 26  wafer   boat   or   wafer   cassette   —   carrier   for
multiple wafers.
5. 27  wafer  chuck  —  platform  withi n  an  automatic
wafer  prober  that  supports  and  transports  the  wafer.
The   chuck   may   contain   the   means   for   controlled
temperature testing.
5. 28  x, y, z and
θ —  motions  relativ e  to  the  center  of
the Probe Card when standing in front of the Prober:
• Motion  to  the  right  is  motion  in  the  positive  X-
direction.
• Motion towards the back of the prober is motion in
the positive Y-direction.
• Motion  away  from  the  floor  is  the  positive  Z-
direction.
• Motion  revolving  around  a  Z-axis  passing  through
the center of the probe card is θ-motion.  Motion in
the  counter-clockwise  direction  when  facing  down
from  above  the  prober  is  motion  in  the  positive  θ-
direction.
5. 29  z-clearance — distance betwe en the user defined
initial  contact  point  and  the  top  surface  of  the  wafer
during that portion of the wafer prober’s cycle when the
wafer chuck is moving the wafer between DUTs.
6  Summary of Method
6. 1  Objective –  A  SEMI  Probe  Sta ndards  Task  Force
has  defined  this  method.    That  task  force  consisted  of
members from semiconductor wafer probe system users
and wafer probe system suppliers.  This method, in part
a guide to collection of data, is aimed at a specific set of
wafer  probe  system  parameters:  accuracy,  repeatability
and  throughput.    This  method  is  a  tool  that  creates
comparative  data.  That  data  will  act  as  a  criterion  by
which  multiple  wafer  probe  systems  can  be  judged
competitively.
6. 2  Probe System Accuracy and T hroughput – A wafer
probe  system  will  have  needle  placement  error  due  to
the   probe   system   electromechanical   systems,   and
additional needle placement error due to the probe card
physical   alignment   of   the   needles.   The   degree   of
accuracy  to  which  the  probe  system  can  place  the
chuck, the effectiveness of the probe system&#x27;s bond pad
to  needle  alignment,  the  physical  alignment  of  the
probe  card  needles  in  their  X  and  Y  plane,  and  the
probe   system&#x27;s   vision   resolution   and   accuracy   (x
microns  of  distance  per  pixel)  will  be  the  factors  that
influence     a     probe     system&#x27;s     overall     placement
performance.
6. 2.1     Probe    system    comparative    acc uracy    and
repeatability are established in this method using probe
mark data acquired manually with a vision system or, if
available, through use of an automated probe mark data
analysis  system.  Acquired  data  is  analyzed  with  the
Probe  Mark  Data  Analysis  algorithm  contained  in  this
method.
6. 2.1.1  The intention of this data colle ction exercise is
not  to  make  a  deterministic  conclusion  establishing  a
probe system’s accuracy. Data analysis results are only
meaningful  in  the  context  of  a  comparative  analysis  of
multiple probe systems.
6. 2.2   Probe  system  throughput  is  be st  determined
using   time   measurements   made   using   a   stopwatch.
Other approaches can be applied, such as:
• the  time  stamp  and  log  file  (if  available)  on  the
probe system under evaluation.
• time   tracking   within   the   device   test   program
employed for testing the prober.
6. 2.3  Any of these approaches is via ble for measuring
time intervals during probe system operation.  That data</p><p>SEMI G78-0699 © SEMI 19994
is to be entered into the data collection table as part of
the application of this method.
6. 2.4  The algorithm collects data fro m 9 wafers out of
a lot of 10.  Three setups are performed using 3 wafers
per setup. All dice will be probed, but data will be taken
only on twelve of the die on each wafer.   Twenty-four
pads on each die are evaluated (see Figure 4).  Overall,
2592 die pads are analyzed in a lot.
6. 2.5  When all the data is collected  and analyzed, each
probe  system  will  have  an  average  die  offset  value.
This  will  be  a  comparative  representation  of  accuracy
consisting of average offsets for all evaluated die.  This
comparative representation of accuracy is a measure of
how  accurate  the  probe  systems  place  the  chuck,  and
thus  the  probe  needles,  to  the  center  point  on  the  die
pads,  consistent  with  normal  operation  of  the  probe
systems.
6. 2.6   In  general,  when  the  probe  ma rks  are  viewed
across   all   dice,   there   will   be   a   data   spread,   or
distribution     of     error     points     for     each     wafer.
Repeatability  is  the  ±  3σ  variation  of  all  die  offsets,
identified   in   this   method   as   the   3σ   calculation   of
Normalized Die Offset.
6. 3  Probe  Card  Issues  –  Probe  car d  construction
variability  and  probe  card  usage  at  temperatures  other
than   ambient   are   important   considerations.      The
following sources of error should be kept in mind:
• In  a  hot  chuck  environment  the  probe  card  and
needles  will  experience  a  high  percentage  of  the
elevated chuck temperature.  The material selection
for  the  probe  card  will  determine  how  it  expands
and   contracts   due   to   the   temperatures   applied.
Probe systems can be equipped with programmable
preheat  (soak)  times.    Longer  preheat  times  will
reduce   probe   card   variability   while   decreasing
throughput.
• Needle  construction  can  result  in  excessive  error
due  to  bending  of  the  needles  when  excessive
probe  system  z-stage  overdrive  is  applied.    The
number  of  needles  and  the  selection  of  needle
technology,   i.e.,   cantilever   versus   vertical,   is
another  variable,  having  a  noticeable  influence  on
measurement results.
• Since each user of this method is not confined to a
standard  for  probe  card  construction,  the  user  of
this  method  is  advised  to  choose  a  probe  card  and
vendor  with  good  integrity,  and  to  use  that  same
probe    card    when    evaluating    multiple    probe
systems.  The assertion here is that the same probe
card used to evaluate multiple systems will react in
a  repeatable  manner  under  varying  environmental
conditions.    This  assumes  there  is  no  excessive
probe   card   needle   wear   during   the   multiple
evaluations,  and  that  needle  alignment  is  verified
or    achieved    before    each    execution    of    the
procedure.
6. 3.1  Probe mark scrub length can v ary due to several
factors including:
 variations  in  the  flatness  of  the  chuck  and
stage travel that are not compensated by the z-
sensor mapping algorithms
 by hard spots in the aluminum pads, or
 by variations in probe tip geometry, etc.
6. 3.2   To  minimize  the  impact  of  this   variation  in  the
probe  mark  analysis  algorithm,  use  only  scrub  mark
location  data  that  is  taken  normal  to  the  direction  of
scrub.  Distances  measured  normal  to  the  orientation  of
the    scrub    mark    are    generally    accepted    to    be
significantly   more   stable   than   that   which   is   taken
parallel to the scrub mark (see Figure 2).
6. 3.3   In  summary,  the  probe  card  its elf  can  be  a
limiting factor when making needle placement accuracy
measurements,   especially   at   varying   environmental
conditions.      Material   selection,   vendor   to   vendor
variation,  construction  of  a  probe  card  (blade,  epoxy
ring,     vertical,     etc.),     especially     with     varying
environmental    conditions,    will    create    inconsistent
analysis    results,    unless    care    is    taken    with    the
application  of  this  method.    The  precautions  discussed
here  are  meant  to  promote  consistent  and  accurate
evaluation results for this method.
6. 3.4   Nevertheless,  the  precautions  m entioned  here
could   ALSO   be   an   important   basis   for   using   this
method.    As  an  example,  a  probe  card  is  typically
designed  for  XY  positional  placement  and  planarity,
and    is    expected    to    meet    customer    specification
requirements in normal operation at room temperatures.
This  method  could  serve  as  a  means  of  establishing
numerical   results   that   represents   the   effects   that
temperature  or  probe  card  construction  variability  have
on probe card specification requirements.
6. 4   The  PMA  Algorithm  –  A  best-f it  rectangle  can  be
drawn   around   the   scrub   mark   and   the   passivation
opening for each pad, reference Figure 3.
NOTE:  Applying  a  best-fit  rectangle  around  the  passivation
opening   may   prove   difficult   for   certain   vision   systems.
Application of the best-fit rectangle around the die pad metal
is an acceptable alternative. The center position of the best-fit
rectangle  around  the  scrub  mark  will  represent  the  center  of
the scrub mark. The center of the die pad is the center of the
best—fit  rectangle  around  the  passivation  opening.    The
distance between the two centers is the pad offset.  Pad offset
is  computed  from  the  four  values  left, right, top,  and  bottom,
reference Figure 2.</p><p>SEMI G78-0699 © SEMI 19995

Scrub Mark Analysis
6. 4.1 Vision   system   measurements   w ill   be   made
establishing  offset  distances  from  the  die  pad  center  to
the  scrub  mark.      The  stability  of  the  measurement  is
greater when made perpendicular to the direction of the
scrub  mark.  This  will  establish  X  and  Y  offsets  via
measurement of offsets for pads in the X and Y plane of
the die.
6. 4.2   Once  the  offsets  are  establishe d,  a  two-step
procedure  will  manipulate  1296  X  and  1296  Y  offset
values.    The  end  result  of  the  algorithm  will  be  a
relative measure of the total probe system accuracy and
repeatability for the pads analyzed.  Figure 5 represents
a visual summary of the method.
6. 5  Considerations  of  Scale  —  Wh en  evaluating  the
suitability  of  a  particular  probe  system  to  probe  a
particular  size  of  bond  pad,  or  to  probe  accurately  at  a
particular pad-to-pad pitch, a good rule of thumb is that
the   prober’s   positional   accuracy,   as   stated   in   its
specifications,  should  be  1/10  that  of  the  scale  of  the
features to be probed.  For example, if the probe system
being  evaluated  has  an  overall  placement  accuracy  of
5μm, it would be inappropriate to analyze wafers using
this  method  and  this  probe  system  for  dice  that  have
pads  less  than  50  μm  square  (this  would  be  less  than
10x).
6. 5.1    Regardless,   when   this   method    is   used   for
evaluation  of  multiple  systems,  it  is  essential  that  die
and bond pad size/pitch consistency be maintained from
evaluation   to   evaluation   if   the   results   are   to   be
meaningful.
6. 5.2   The  same  10×  rule  applies  to  t he  vision  system
or automated Probe Mark Analysis system employed to
make   the   pad   offset   measurements.   These   systems
should  have  a  pixel  resolution  that  is  at  least  10×  finer
than  the  die  pad  dimensions  associated  with  the  scrub
marks being measured.
6. 6  Conclusion —  It  is  assumed  th at  the  user  of  this
method  has  a  wafer  probe  system  or  systems,  or  is
planning  to  make  a  selection  from  the  various  systems
available  in  the  market  place,  and  requires  objective
comparative  analysis  for  accuracy,  repeatability  and
throughput.
6. 6.1   It  should  be  clear  that  this  met hod  employs  a
three-step    process    of    probing,    probe    mark    data
collection, and data analysis.
6. 6.2   When  probing,  every  die  on  ea ch  of  the  ten
wafers  is  to  be  “tested”  and  probed.    Of  those  ten
wafers, the last nine with 12 die per wafer will be used
for scrub mark data collection.  At least 24 pads per die
will  be  used  for  the  analysis.    The  first  wafer  is  meant
only  to  allow  stabilization  for  the  probe  system  and  its
probe card.</p><p>SEMI G78-0699 © SEMI 19996
Figure 4
Recommended Dice and Pads to be used for Data Collection
6. 6.3 It  is  important  that  the  wafers  u sed  with  this
method  are  probed  only  once,  or  else  multiple  scrub
marks  may  be  difficult  for  the  measurement  system  to
deal  with  and  will  most  likely  influence  the  analysis
results. This method assumes the wafer is ideal, having
no die skew due to wafer process anomalies.
NOTE:  It  is  possible  that  a  not  so  perfect  probe  tip  to  pad
alignment  (PTTPA)  may  create  misleading  results  for  this
method.  It  is  recommended  that  PTTPA  be  done  on  die
located at the edge of the wafer, as shown in Figure 4. This is
opposed  to  having  PTTPA  done  on  die  in  the  center  of  the
wafer.  An  offset  error  incurred  in  the  context  of  a  PTTPA
done in the center may result in an incremental and continuing
error as testing moves across the wafer. With this method that
error may be averaged-out.
6. 6.4   Probe  system  index  time  is  dev ice  and  probe
system   dependent.      Probe   system   index   time   is
determined    by    acceleration,    maximum    achievable
velocity,  and  distance  traveled  die  to  die  by  the  chuck.
Thus,  the  device  type  chosen  for  use  with  this  method
should    be    representative    of    typical    die    size    if
meaningful  index  time  and  throughput  data  are  to  be
gathered.</p><p>SEMI G78-0699 © SEMI 19997
6. 6.5   If  the  results  of  this  method  tu rn  out  to  be
unfavorable, the user has the option of applying a more
detailed,   enhanced   data   analysis   application   of   this
method.  That  application  is  contained  in  Appendix  1.
The   enhanced   method   uses   the   same   data,   but   it
requires  more  manipulation  of  the  data  during  data
analysis.      The   detail   contained   in   the   enhanced
algorithm  will  provide  the  user  with  greater  insight  as
to  the  cause  of  unfavorable  results  related  to  the  probe
system  under  evaluation.    A  summary  of  the  enhanced
method is shown in Figure 6.
6. 7  Alternatives —  What  has  been   left  undefined  to
this  point  is  availability  of  an  automated  approach  to
data  collection  per  the  requirements  of  this  method.
Regardless,     data     collection     can     be     manually
accomplished.    The  manual  process  is  laborious  and
requires   a   video   measuring   system   to   make   offset
measurements  on  the  die  pads,  and  a  spreadsheet  to
analyze the resulting data.
6. 7.1   If  manual  operation  is  not  desi rable  or  practical,
automated Probe Mark Analysis Systems do exist in the
market place as an item to be purchased.  Providers are
also  available  to  accept  probed  wafers  and  execute
probe mark analysis under contract as a service.
NOTE: A  Final  Note  to  the  User  of  This  Method —  This
method  provides  sufficient  data  for  sophisticated  analysis  of
probe  system  performance  across  die-to-die,  wafer-to-wafer,
and setup-to-setup.  It also provides a simple metric.  It is easy
to  make  comparisons  with  simple  &quot;single  number&quot;  metrics,
but   that   has   the   potential   for   oversight,   distortion   and
subsequent  inappropriate  comparisons.    The  test  engineer,
working with the probe system supplier, must be the ultimate
judge  of  the  applicability  of  this  method  and  the  correct
interpretation of the results.

7  Required Hardware Check list (see Figure 7)
 Wafer prober (if the test plan includes either hot or
cold     chuck     testing,     the     prober     must     be
appropriately equipped).
 A   planarized   and   aligned   probe   card   which
matches  the  selected  wafers,  accompanied  by  a
metrology  tool  printout  of  the  ‘x’,  ‘y’  and  ‘z’
positions  of  all  of  the  probe  tips  to  be  used  for
probe mark analysis.  Note:  The probe card should
be  measured  for  alignment,  but  not  ”tweaked”,
immediately  prior  to  and  after  the  conclusion  of
each subsequent test.
 Untested wafers
 A special “test program” with a fixed “test” time.
 Tester or PC that will run the “test program”.  If a
PC   is   used   to   simulate   the   tester,   it   must   be
equipped    with    the    appropriate    hardware    for
communication with the wafer prober.
 A  stopwatch,  with  0.1  second  resolution.    The
stopwatch is to have “split” capability.
Note  that  the  user  of  this  method  may  choose  at
their  discretion  to  utilize  any  other  time  stamp
logging technology at their disposal, so long as the
computational  overhead  of  this  logging  has  no
effect upon the throughput of the prober.
8  Requirements (see Figure  7)
8. 1  Qualified  Prober  —  Before  in itiating  the  test
process,   the   wafer   prober   is   to   be   certified   by   a
representative  of  the  prober  manufacturer  to  be  fully
operational.
8. 2  Qualified Personnel — The in dividual running the
wafer prober for the test procedure must be certified or
otherwise qualified to operate the prober being tested.
9  Test conditions (see Figu re 7)
9. 1  Test  Time  —  a  fixed  “device  te st  time”  will  be
used  during  these  tests.    The  recommended  value  for
this test time is 1.0 seconds.
9. 2  Accuracy and Repeatability vs . Throughput — The
person  or  manufacturer  running  this  test  may  make  a
choice  (or  choices)  as  to  how  they  elect  to  balance
accuracy and repeatability with throughput, but all three
tests  must  be  run  simultaneously.  This  will  generate  a
set  of  numbers  defining  a  particular  prober&#x27;s  accuracy
and repeatability at a given throughput (or a throughput
at a given accuracy and repeatability).  All adjustments
to  the  prober  are  to  be  made  using  standard,  end-user-
adjustable  settings,  and  all  prober  settings  associated
with a particular throughput / accuracy and repeatability
combination are to be included in the final report.
9. 3  Temperature — This test can b e conducted at any
temperature,  however,  numerous  variable  can  distort
the  results  if  run  at  a  temperature  other  than  ambient,
i.e.  probe  tip  drift  due  to  an  increase  or  decrease  in
temperature.
• Cautionary  Note:  If  the  tests  are  performed  at
temperatures other than ambient, the user must use
the  same  probe  card  and  wafer  type  for  all  tests
across  all  test  platforms  to  ensure  uniformity  of
results.
9. 4  Probe  Card  Type  —  All  types   of  probe  cards
(blade, peripheral / cantilever or vertical) may be used,
so long as they leave a visible scrub mark.
• Cautionary note: Some vertical probe cards exhibit
an  inherent  amount  of  ‘x’  -  ‘y’  needle  drift.    The
user  should  verify  the  intrinsic  repeatability  of  the
probe  card  before  using  it  to  characterize  the
prober.

9. 5  Probe   Card   Condition   —   a   me trology   tool
printout  verifying  the  ‘x’,  ‘y’  and  ‘z’  position  of  each
probe is within the users specification must accompany
the probe card.
9. 6  Tester  –  Prober  Communicatio ns  —  The  type  of
communications  method  used  between  the  prober  and
the  tester  is  left  up  to  the  user  of  this  test  method.
Because communication overhead varies with protocol,
the  same  hardware  and  “test  program”  (modified  as
necessary  to  communicate  to  the  prober  under  test)
must be used for all tests.
9. 7  Presence  of  the  PTI  —  During   the  test,  the  probe
card  must  have  loading  similar  to  that  applied  by  the
normal   “in   use”   application   such   as   a   Probe   Test
Interface  (PTI)  or  Direct  Docking  Pogo     Stack.  The
force exerted on the probe card by the PTI will stabilize
the  probe  card,  improving  the  repeatability  of  the  data
collected.
9. 8  Wafer Cassette —  For  the  purp oses  of  these  tests,
a cassette of wafers is defined as containing ten wafers.
Ensure the wafers are placed in the same slots for each
test.
10  Test Procedure (see Figur es 8 and 9)

10. 6      Start     probing     process     and     stop watch
simultaneously.
10. 7    The   “test   program”   must   perfo r m   automatic
alignment of the probe card to the wafer prior to wafer
#’s 1, 2, 5, and 8.
NOTE:  While  not  required,  it  is  recommended  that  the  PTI
and  Probe  Card  be  removed  and  re-installed  prior  to  each  of
the automatic alignment steps to simulate whatever locational
error  might  be  induced  by  manipulation  of  the  interface  and
the probe card.

A1-1  Probe Mark Data Analysis   Algorithm:
A1-1.1  Introduction
A1-1.1.1  The Probe Mark Analysis syst em recognizes the edge of the bond pad passivation opening and the probe
mark, draws a best-fit rectangle around the probe mark and passivation opening, and returns the four distances, Left,
Right, Bottom and Top to a text file.  The center position of the best-fit rectangle can be used to represent the center
of  the  scrub  mark.  An  offset  of  this  center  of  scrub  mark  from  the  center  of  the  bond  pad  can  be  calculated  as

A1-1.2.1  We will use a sampling schem e of 9 wafers per lot, (3 setups per lot, 3 wafers per setup), 12 die per wafer
and  24  pads  per  die.  The  first  step  of  doing  data  analysis  is  to  obtain  the  offsets  for  all  the  pads  that  have  been

A1-1.3.1  Discussion of Average Die Off set
A1-1.3.1.1   Based  on  the  sample  described ,  there  will  be  an  Average  Die  Offset-X  and  Average  Die  Offset  Y  for
each  of  the  108  die  sampled.  This  value  is  probably  the  most  descriptive,  especially  when  graphed  (see  example
graphs).    Both  X  and  Y-graphs  will  most  likely  resemble  a  sine  wave.    This  is  due  to  wafer  rotation.    As  you
serpentine  across  the  wafer  there  will  be  a  slight  offset  from  die  to  die.    Since  the  selected  sample  dice  are  in  the
center  and  around  the  edges  of  the  wafer,  you  can  see  the  progression  of  the  offset  as  you  move  farther  from  the
center of the wafer.  The X and Y graphs are usually about 90º out of phase.
A1-1.3.1.2
Other  qualitative  information  c an  also  be  gathered  by  visually  looking  at  the  graphs  of  this  data.    One
can determine whether the accuracy is varying wafer to wafer (each set of 12 data points is a wafer) or set-up to set-
up  (each  set  of  36  data  points  is  a  set-up)  or  just  drifting  over  time.    Drift  over  time  is  sometimes  caused  by
temperature stabilization issues within the prober mechanism.  Subsequent steps will quantify how much variability
is caused by each.</p><p>SEMI G78-0699 © SEMI 199915

A1-1.4.1  Discussion of Normalized (by  die) Pad Offset
A1-1.4.1.1  This step helps to quantify how  much error is caused by the prober vs. the probe card.  The probe card
usually does NOT impact average offset of a die, just the variability within a die.  In this equation, we subtract the
average die offset (presumed prober error) from each pad in that die.  This data is then used for the next step.
A1-1.5
Step 3 — Calculate P-P-X or P -P-Y = 3σ of Normalized (by die) Pad Offset (4).
A1-1.5.1
All the normalized pad offsets  in the same lot (no matter on which die, on which wafer the pad resides)
are  treated  on  an  equal  basis.  In  our  example,  a  total  of  2592  pads  are  sampled  in  a  lot.  All  1296  x-direction  and
1296  y-direction  pads  of
Normalized  (by  die)  Pad  Offset  will  be  used  to  calculate  a  3σ  variation  which  is  called
Pad-to-Pad variation
(P-P-X and P-P-Y).
A1-1.5.2  Discussion of P-P-X or P-P-Y  (Pad-to-Pad Variation in the X-direction or Pad-to-Pad-Variation in the Y-
direction)
A1-1.5.2.1   These  values  describe  how  mu ch  variability  there  is  within  all  the  pads  in  the  lot.    This  value  is
frequently attributed to probe tip variation in X, Y, and Z.  Although probe tips do change and wear over time, their
unloaded  position  usually  does  not  change  dramatically  within  one  lot.    This  value  does  not  help  tremendously  in
describing prober accuracy nor should it be used for any sort of probecard metrology.  However, be sure to perform
a  mental  reality  check  to  verify  that  it  is  somewhere  near  (within  an  order  of  magnitude  of)  your  probe  card  X/Y
probe needle position specification.

A1-1.6.1  Discussion of Average Wafer O ffset
A1-1.6.1.1  This equation will result in nin e values for Average Wafer Offset-X and nine for Average Wafer Offset-
Y.  These numbers could also be graphed to look for trends from wafer to wafer (this is not included on the example
graphs).  If there is a consistent trend in one direction possible causes are:
•
wafer loading error
•
cumulative stepping error, and
•
temperature stability errors</p><p>SEMI G78-0699 © SEMI 199916

A1-1.7.1  Discussion of Normalized (by  wafer) Die Offset
A1-1.7.1.1  This normalization step is a pr ecursor to calculating a 3σ variation value.  To calculate the true Die-to-
Die variation, any wafer-to-wafer induced error is subtracted out from the by-die-data.  This data is used in the next
step.
A1-1.8
Step 6 — Calculate D-D-X or  D-D-Y = 3σ of Normalized (by wafer) Die Offset (6)
A1-1.8.1
These normalized die offsets a re again treated on the equal basis. A 3σ value is calculated and becomes
our Die-to-Die Variation
(D-D-X, D-D-Y).
A1-1.8.2  Discussion  of  D-D-X  or  D-D-Y   (Die-to-Die  3σ  variation  in  the  X-direction,  Die-to-Die  3σ  variation  in
the Y-direction)
A1-1.8.2.1  This equation will result in the  3σ variation of the average die offsets from Die-to-Die in both X- and
Y-directions.  If this number is very large, there should be concern about the repeatability of the prober.

A1-1.9.1.1   These  equations  will  produce  s ix  values,  three  for  Average-  (by  Setup)  Offset-in-the-X-direction  and
three  for  Average-  (by  Setup)  Offset-in-the-Y-direction.    These  values  describe  the  average  offset  of  all  of  the  die
“tested” with a particular setup.

A1-1.11  Step 9 — Calculate W-W-X o r W-W-Y = 3σ of Normalized (by setup) Wafer Offset (8).
A1-1.11.1
A 3σ variation will be calculat ed based on the normalized wafer offset and will be cited as the Wafer-to-
Wafer variation (W-W-X, W-W-Y).
A1-1.11.2  Discusssion  of  W-W-X  or  W-W -Y  (Wafer-to-Wafer  variation  in  the  X-direction,  Wafer-to-Wafer
variation in the Y-direction)
A1-1.11.2.1   This  equation  will  produce  a  v alue  for  the  3σ  variation  from  Wafer-to-Wafer  in  the  X  and  Y
directions.    If  this  number  were  large,  it  would  tend  to  indicate  that  the  prober  does  not  behave  repeatably  from
wafer-to-wafer.  Possible causes are:
•
loading problems
•
temperature stability issues, and
•
wafer rotation issues

A1-1.12.1.1  This will be one of the values  added to the graph.  This is simply the average of all of the average die
offsets in the X-direction and all of the average die offsets in the Y-direction.  If one needed to pick a single number
in X and Y to describe the accuracy of the prober – this is the one.  This can be very misleading though – what this
number really tells you is what value the distribution is centered around.  Refer to the graph to get a visual sense of
this data.

A1-1.15.1  Discussion of Normalized (by  lot) Die Offset
A1-1.15.1.1   This  step  is  useful  if  you  need   to  compare  the  variation  between  several  different  lots.    It  is  not
completely necessary for the next step, since subtracting a constant from a string of numbers does not change the 3σ
variation, only the center point.

A1-1.16.1
Discussion fo TTLX or TTLY
A1-1.16.1.1   This  is  the  value  for  determini ng  (with  3σ  confidence)  whether  your  probe  marks  will  always  fall
within your desired spec.   They are the hatch-marked lines.
A1-1.17
Step  15  —  This  normalized  di e  offset  includes  Die-to-Die,  Wafer-to-Wafer,  and  Setup-to-Setup  offsets
thus a 3σ variation of this offset will be called Total Prober
Variation (TTLX and TTLY).
A1-1.17.1  Calculate Total Prober Error  Range (3σ).
LOTX + TTLX,  LOTX  - TTLX = Total Prober X-Error Range (3σ)
LOTY + TTLY,  LOTY  - TTLY = Total Prober Y-Error Range (3σ)

A1-1.18
Discussion of Graphs (one exa mple for X <!-- -->[Figure X]<!-- --> and one for Y <!-- -->[Figure Y]<!-- -->)
A1-1.18.1  Average Lot X-Offset is the va lue from Step 10.  This number shows where the probe mark distribution
is centered (the accuracy of the prober).
A1-1.18.2
Average Lot X-Offset +3σ is t he result from step 10 + the result from step 14
A1-1.18.3  Average Lot X-Offset -3σ is th e result from step 10 – the result from step 14
A1-1.18.4  These two lines show the ± 3σ  range of your distribution.  This describes the repeatability of the prober.
NOTE:  There will always be explainable and unexplainable accuracy and repeatability errors on a prober.  If these two lines fall
within your desired
specification, you will probably not have any problems.  The example graph for X-offset illustrates a well-
behaved, or “passing” prober.  The example graph for Y-offset, on the other hand, is representative of a prober which failed to
meet the desired accuracy specification.
A1-1.18.5  The upper and lower desired s pecification limits have been added to the graphs.
A1-1.18.6
The final piece of data added t o the graph is the Average Die Offset.  This, as stated in Step 1, is very
good at illustrating any trends throughout the lot.</p><p>SEMI G78-0699 © SEMI 199919
A1-1.18.7  Tips for graph making:
•
Add gridlines across the X-axis to separate wafers.
•
Print all graphs (X and Y, different lots, different probers) with the same scale in X and Y.
•
Add a legend to your graphs, so that they will be readable by your “audience” as well as yourself.

NOTE  1:  The  term  “input”  as  it  appears  in  this  document
refers to the device under test.
6  Test Methods
6. 1  See Figure 1.
NOTE 2: A verification procedure to complement this Overall
Digital  Timing  Accuracy  Specification  is  currently  being
developed as a SEMI draft document.
6. 2  Explanation of Figure 1 — Th is figure is meant to
graphically  describe  Overall  Timing  Accuracy  and  its
constituent   components.      Overall   Timing   Accuracy
(OTA)   is   made   up   of   three   components,   and   by
definition  is  the  aggregate  timing  error  comprised  of
input  edge  placement  accuracy  (see  Section  7.1.1),
output edge placement accuracy (see Section 7.1.2), and
input to output timing accuracy (see Section 7.1.3).  It’s
important   to   note   that   the   OTA   specification   and
associated graphical representation shown in Figure 1 is
meant to encompass timing delay errors across multiple
machines,  as  well  as  multiple  calibrations  for  a  single
machine over time.
6. 2.1   Our  experience  in  dealing  with    multiple-pin
automated  test  systems  reveals  that  not  all  input  drive
circuits can place a drive edge at exactly the same point
in  time  relative  to  a  common  reference.    The  same  is
true for output compare circuits when placing compare
edges.    Thus,  these  edges  tend  to  have  an  (error)
distribution around some average value relative to their
intended placement.  This is due in part to the inherent
anomalies associated with electronic circuits that make-
up  these  edge  placement  elements.    The  distribution  of
edge  error  is  graphically  shown  for  input  (see  Section
7. 1.1)  and  output  edge  (see  Section  7.1.2)  signals  in
Figure 1.
6. 2.2     Drive    Input    to    Compare    Outpu t    Timing
Accuracy  (Section  7.1.3)  can  be  described  in  different
ways.    It  is  easy  to  think  of  this  parameter,  per  the
definition  given  in  this  document,  Section  7.1.3,  as
simply  the  relative  time  difference  (skew)  between  the
drive  delay  timing  error  distribution  and  the  compare
delay timing error distribution for a particular machine.
But  this  parameter,  once  established  for  a  machine,  is
not  necessarily  constant.    For  example,  this  parameter
can  change  from  one  calibration  of  a  machine  at  a
particular  time,  to  something  different,  as  a  result  of  a
subsequent  calibration  of  that  same  machine.    As  well,
this  parameter  can  also  be  considered  as  a  machine  to
machine accuracy parameter, not necessarily having the
same  value  between  any  two  machines  of  the  same
kind.
6. 2.3  Thus, on each machine and at  different points in
time for the same machine the Drive Input to Compare
Output  Timing  skew  can  be  uniquely  different  per
machine.   That   difference   being   influenced   by   the
various  machine  anomalies  that  contribute  to  machine
error  including  the  not  so  perfect  results  of  a  periodic
edge calibration.

6. 2.4   Examination  of  the  OTA  defin ition  in  the  con-
text  of  Figure  1,  that  being  the  general  case  and  not  a
single  point  timing  evaluation,  reveals  that  the  overall
timing accuracy time value is the time line indicated by
“A”  and  the  time  line  indicated  by  “B”.    In  a  single
point  AC  timing  evaluation,  OTA  is  determined  as  a
distribution  of  edges  associated  with  time  line  “A”  or
time line “B”, depending upon the relationship between
the  drive  edge  values  and  compare  edge  values  (see
Section 7.1.3) at that point in time.

TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMING
ACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT
This  test  method  was  technically  approved  by  the  Global  Automated  Test  Equipment  Committee  and  is  the
direct responsibility of the North American Automated Test Equipment Committee. Current edition approved
by  the  North  American  Regional  Standards  Committee  on  September  3,  1999.  Initially  available  at
<a href="http://www.semi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.semi.org</a> December 1999; to be published February 2000.
1  Purpose</p><ol><li>1   This  procedure  will  define  a  st andard  process
whereby  any  logic  integrated  circuit  (IC)  ATE  system
can  be  evaluated  for  parameters  that  makeup  an  AC
timing accuracy specification.</li><li>2   Application  of  this  procedure  w ill  simplify  ATE
comparisons,  reduce  specification  ambiguity,  simplify
user acceptance procedures, simplify ATE performance
monitoring,  and  provide  a  common  validation  criteria
for ATE suppliers.
2  Scope</li><li>1   This  procedure  is  intended  for   analysis  of  timing
accuracy specifications for all semiconductor automatic
test   equipment   (ATE)   capable   of   digital   functional
testing.    The  extent  of  the  analysis  includes  overall
timing accuracy and the primary components of overall
timing  accuracy  as  defined  in  the  definition  section  of
this document.</li><li>2   This  procedure  does  not  includ e  analysis  of  the
following   parameters   associated   with   ATE   timing
accuracy:
• minimum driver pulse width,
• comparator bandwidth,
• I/O round trip delay,
• test fixturing errors,
• device insertion errors,
• time measurement unit (TMU) accuracy, and
• ATE  capability  or  performance  beyond  AC  timing
accuracy.</li><li>3     Application    of    this    procedure    c an    reduce
equipment acceptance time resulting in savings for both
the end-users and ATE suppliers.</li><li>4   This  standard  does  not  purport   to  address  safety
issues,   if   any,   associated   with   its   use.   It   is   the
responsibility  of  the  users  of  this  standard  to  establish
appropriate  safety  and  health  practices  and  determine
the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
3  Limitations</li><li>1    The   following   limitations   are   i nherent   to   this
procedure:</li><li>1.1  The tolerances of each measur ement used in the
procedure are listed in each test, where appropriate.</li><li>1.2  The verification methods do n ot include varying
environmental  conditions,  so  results  may  not  reflect
performance at environmental limits.</li><li>1.2.1   Due  to  execution  time  limits,  t he  verification
procedure  does  not  represent  an  exhaustive  analysis.
The number of data points analyzed is intended to pro-
vide  a  minimum  representative  assessment  of  AC  tim-
ing accuracy parameters in a practical amount of time.</li><li>1.3   This  method  uses  only  edge  co mpare  mode  and
non-multiplexed   operation   in   providing   a   minimum
representative assessment of AC timing accuracy.</li><li>1.4   This  method  does  not  determin e  the  effects  that
duty cycle variations have on AC timing accuracy.</li><li>1.5   Not  being  an  exhaustive  analy sis  this  method
avoids  comprehensive  testing  as  might  be  expected  for
complex AC timing functions such as on-the-fly (OTF)
timing.    This  method  was  defined  with  the  intention  of
keeping    the    data    gathering    practical    such    that
meaningful results are obtained in a reasonable amount
of  time.    In  the  case  of  timing-on-the  fly  a  routine  is
contained in this method and can be used as a reference
parameter for comparative purposes when systems with
on-the-fly  timing  are  analyzed.    Thus  only  the  most
fundamental  AC  timing  results  are  produced  and  OTF
timing  is  not  included  as  part  of  the  overall  timing
accuracy (OTA) results.</li><li>1.6   Discretion  is  advised  when  int erpreting  OTA
results  obtained  from  this  method.  Self-analysis  cannot
allow for all error components to be isolated. Thus good
(compliant) method results should be viewed with cau-
tion  as  potentially  compliant.  On  the  other  hand,  poor
(non-compliant)  method  results  are  a  strong  indication
that   the   system   under   evaluation   is   questionable
regarding its accuracy and most likely non-compliant.</li></ol><p>SEMI G80-0200 © SEMI 20002

6  Summary of Method
6. 1   This  procedure  provides  a  hier archical,  generic
method   of   analyzing   ATE   timing   accuracy.      The
hierarchy  supports  two  levels  of  specification  analysis.
Broad,  composite  net  results  are  available  by  using  the
ATE for self-analysis in Level 1.
6. 2   At  this  level,  a  large  amount  o f  data  can  be  effi-
ciently  collected,  representing  the  net  conformance  to
overall timing accuracy specifications.  This technique,
however,  precludes  isolation  and  detailed  analysis  of
specific  accuracy  components.    Therefore,  a  second
level  of  analysis,  incorporating  external  instruments  is
included. While the first level provides efficient, broad
analysis,   the   second   level   provides   less   efficient,
detailed analysis.
6. 3   Results  from  the  analyses  are  s aved  in  a  standard
format  to  facilitate  further  use  for  application  specific
data reduction.  The minimum format is:
test #,     channel #, min value,     max value

7  Requirements
7. 1   Acceptance  Tests  —  Before  in itiating  the  test
process, the ATE under evaluation is to be certified by
a  representative  of  the  manufacturer  or  end-user  to  be
fully operational.
7. 2    Personnel   Qualification   —   Th e   individual(s)
operating the ATE under evaluation must be certified or
otherwise  qualified  to  operate  this  equipment,  and  be
familiar with the procedures for performing the analysis
called-out in this document.
7. 3  Supplemental Equipment —  T he  following  equip-
ment  is  required:  A  digital  sampling  oscilloscope  with</p><blockquote><p>10 GHz bandwidth, probes with &gt; 1 GHz bandwidth,
500   ohm   input   impedance,   2.5   pF   ±   0.5pF   input
capacitance,  and  &lt;  0.125&quot;  ground  lead.    It  is  important
that this equipment requirement step be met. Tolerances
called-out   in   various   steps   of   this   procedure   were
chosen  to  be  consistent  with  the  general  equipment
specified in this equipment specification requirement.
7. 4   This  Procedure  —  It  is  highly   recommended  that
the user of this method read this document (SEMI G80)
in its entirety.
7. 5   System — Test system usage  will be available on
a continuous basis and uninterrupted during the allotted
time needed to perform this timing analysis procedure.
7. 6   Application  Program  — It  is  r equired  that  an
application  program  be  written  to  perform  the  steps
called-out in this procedure. That program will act as a
means of reliable and consistent interaction between the
tester  and  supplemental  equipment.    In  so  executing,
that  program  will  also  facilitate  the  data  collection
process  that  will  ultimately  lead  to  the  timing  analysis
conclusions this procedure produces.
7. 7  The Method — The recommen ded procedure, con-
tained primarily in Section 10 of this document, is gen-
erically  written  and  will  serve  as  a  guide  in  producing
the  required  program,  written  in  the  test  application
software language of the system under evaluation.
7. 8   ATE System  Performance  (Loa d)  Boards  —  To
collect   data   two   performance/load   boards   will   be
required.    For  one  of  these  performance  boards  it  is
recommended  that  adjacent  tester  channels  be  shorted
together   with   minimum   and   equal   length   intercon-
nections.  This  board  will  facilitate  the  data  collection
process for Level 1 and in part for Level 2.  The second
board   is   to   have   an   open   driver   to   comparator
connection  and  will  be  used  for  Level  2  drive  input
timing tests.  Reference Figures 1 and 4.
7. 9   Exceptions  —  It  is  expected  th at  the  user  of  this
method  execute  the  procedures  as  described  in  this
document.  If the method user should choose to deviate
from  the  procedures  recommended  in  this  document  it
is   expected   that   an   appropriate   description   of   that
deviation   be   entered   in   the   EXCEPTIONS   PAGE
provided in Appendix 3.
8  Test Conditions
8. 1   Environmental  —  It  is  a  requir ement  that  the
procedure   called-out   in   this   document   be   executed
within the intended environmental operating conditions
specified   by   the   equipment   supplier.      Operating
temperature  requirements  specified  by  the  equipment
supplier must be maintained.
8. 2   Optional  Execution  —  The  use r  of  this  procedure
may consider rerunning this procedure at environmental
(temperature) extremes other than nominal.
8. 3    Warm-up   Period   —   It   is   essen tial   that   all
equipment  used  or  under  evaluation  be  allowed  to
warm-up    in    accordance    with    the    manufacturer’s
specified requirements for equipment stabilization.
8. 4   Optional  Data  Collection  —  D ata  may  be  taken
immediately after equipment calibration.  However, the
user  of  this  procedure  may  wish  to  take  additional  data
at subsequent time intervals, but within the known good
calibration window for the system under evaluation.
9  Preparation of Apparatus
9. 1  Equipment Configuration — T he equipment under
evaluation   must   be   configured   for   its   normal   and
intended  operation.    No  special  considerations  such  as
additional cooling or removal of equipment skins are to
be undertaken.
9. 2   Equipment  Calibration  —  The   equipment  under
evaluation  must  be  fully  calibrated  before  this  proce-
dure  is  executed.    No  special  calibration  is  to  be</p></blockquote><p>SEMI G80-0200 © SEMI 20004
performed  and  the  equipment  is  to  be  configured  for
normal and intended operation.
9. 3   Supplemental  Equipment  Calib ration  — External
equipment   used   for   level   2   data   collection   in   this
procedure must be verified for proper calibration.
10  Test Method Procedure
10. 1   The  procedure  is  comprised  of   Level  1  tests  and
Level  2  tests.  Any  ATE  capability  described  in  the
following  tests  that  is  not  available  on  the  ATE  under
analysis    is    not    required    for    compliance    to    the
procedure,   but   should   be   noted   in   the   verification
results Table 1 and Table 2.
10. 2  Each test system is different; t hus this procedure
is  generic.  Regardless,  it  will  provide  comprehensive
results  when  the  specific  application  is  created  using
this procedure as a guide.  Per the requirements, a load
board and application program written to accommodate
the procedure should be in place when the procedure is
executed.  This  procedure  is  to  be  executed  per  the
requirements  outlined  in  Section  7  of  this  document.
When  these  requirements  are  met,  the  following  steps
will comprise the step by step process for execution of

in  Sections  10.3.1,  10.3.4,  10.3.5,  and  10.3.6  for  Level
1  as  well  as  Sections  10.4.1,  10.4.2,  10.4.3,  10.4.4,</li><li>4.5, and 10.4.6  for Level 2.</li><li>Execute the method to completion. The application

and store that for later analysis.</li><li>This procedure calls for various time measurements
to  be  made  at  specified  voltage  points  or  signal  levels.
The user is encouraged to maintain these values to keep
the  method  results  constants  when  system  to  system
comparisons  are  being  made.    Regardless,  he  is  free  to
adjust these measurement points or levels to accommo-
date specific integrated circuit technology requirements
important   to   that   product   and   the   system   being
analyzed.    When  that  occurs  documentation  of  those
procedure  variations  must  be  entered  in  Appendix  3
(Exceptions Page).</li><li>Best  results  from  this  procedure  are  achieved  if  a
consistent   measurement   methodology   is   maintained.
This  is  important  when  making  time  measurements
relative to a particular transition point on a signal edge.
This  method  recommends  that  when  signal  measure-
ments  are  specified  at  a  particular  transition  point,  i.e.,

10. 3   Level  1  Tests  —  Level  1  tests  a re  intended  to
efficiently  gather  a  large  amount  of  data  by  taking
advantage of the self-analysis ability of the ATE.  This
is  accomplished  by  shorting  adjacent  tester  channels
together  on  a  performance  board  with  minimum,  equal
length  interconnections,  and  using  one  channel  to  test
the  other.    Reference  Figure  1.  Execution  speed  and
system resource coverage are of primary importance for
Level  1.    Level  1  is  intended  to  analyze  specification
conformance  as  opposed  to  diagnose  system  failures.
All  measurements  are  normalized  to  “zero”  in  order  to
facilitate subsequent data reduction/analysis.  Level 1 is
intended   to   collect   data   only.   Data   reduction   and
processing are to be done off-line in order to maximize
data collection efficiency.
10. 3.1   Timing  Linearity  Test  —  This   test  is  used  to
establish drive input to compare output timing accuracy
by   “stretching”   the   test   cycle   in   minimum   cycle
programming  increments  while  using  fixed  percentage
delays and pulse widths as the method  sweeps through
various  timing  conditions.    The  test  pattern  should  be
written  to  switch  all  even  or  odd  pins  simultaneously,
and for all transitions and associated strobes to occur at
least 100 times for each data point.
10. 3.2  For clarification all drive edge s are detected in
parallel in pairs.  The intention is to sweep the compare
edge  and  detect  the  earliest  occurrence  of  a  drive  edge
with the latest compare edge, as well as detect the latest
occurrence  of  a  drive  edge  with  the  earliest  compare
edge.

Pairs of adjacent tester pins can be shorted together
with   a   minimum   length   interconnect   on   the
performance board.
A   reference   for   the   oscilloscope   measurement   is
required.        That    reference    can    be    any    signal
synchronized   to   the   test   system&#x27;s   timing.   The
reference  signal  chosen  should  be  consistent  and
stable. Examples of this may be another tester pin or
master oscillator reference signal.

Level 2 Verification
10. 4  Level 2 Tests — The efficiency  of data collection
with  Level  1  tests  may  preclude  isolation  of  certain
specification components.  The self-analysis procedures
may also mask some error terms that contribute to other
specification  components.  Therefore,  Level  2  modules
are  intended  to  supplement  Level  1  results  by  using
external     instruments     to     distinguish     individual
specification  components  and  provide  detailed  analysis</p><p>SEMI G80-0200 © SEMI 20008
of  potentially  masked  results.    The  use  of  external
instruments    facilitates    independent    observation    of
individual  parameters,  but  requires  physical  movement
of  a  probe  (unless  automated  with  robotics),  which
results  in  less  efficient  data  collection.          Reference

an
external  instrument  must  be  used  to  isolate  the  driver
input  timing  error  from  compare  output  timing  error.
An  external  instrument  is  also  required  to  identify  pin
to pin “skew” beyond adjacent pins, since Level 1 only
uses  adjacent  pin  pairs  for  analysis.    This  requires
independent   measurements   of   representative   driver
input     timing     conditions.          The     reference     for
measurement  of  driver  input  timing  error  is  a  high
bandwidth-digital  sampling  oscilloscope.    Exhaustive
testing  of  all  pins  is  impractical,  so  a  reduced  set  of
representative  conditions  is  used.    A  non-binary  pin
sampling  increment  is  used  to  ensure  that  traditional
binary    architectural    boundaries    are    crossed.    The
tolerance  for  the  driver  input  timing  error  test  is  ±

10. 4.2   Compare  Output  Timing  Error   Test  —  Since
the compare output timing error cannot be distinguished
from  driver  input  timing  error  with  Level  1  tests,  an

output timing error from driver input timing error.  This
requires   independent   measurement   of   representative</p><p>9 See APPENDIX 2, Section A2-1.3 and Appendix 2, Examples for an

to  provide  a  synchronous  reference  signal  by  shorting
adjacent  tester  channels  together  on  a  performance
board  with  minimum,  equal  length  interconnections.
The  actual  delay  of  the  driver  signal  is  verified  with  a
high  bandwidth-digital  sampling  oscilloscope.    (See
Figure 4.)
NOTE 2: If a signal reflection is present at the midpoint of the
observed signal (due to a long distance from the performance
board  to  the  tester  receiver),  then  the  25%  point  of  the
reference  driver  waveform  should  be  used,  instead  of  the
midpoint - as specified below.
10. 4.2.1   Exhaustive  testing  of  all  pins  i s  impractical,
so  a  reduced  set  of  representative  conditions  are  used.
A non-binary pin sampling increment is used to ensure
that   traditional   binary   architectural   boundaries   are
crossed.

the test flow:
for amplitude = 3V
for pin = 1 to n by 3
for test_cycle = min, 2<em>min, 3</em>min, 10*min
for format_delay = 50% of test_cycle
for format = NR
for edge = rising, falling

NOTE 3: Midpoint detection of the NR drive signal should be
done via a compare edge sweep technique.
10. 4.3   Driver  Transition  Time  Test  —   Since  driver
transition time errors can be masked by compare timing
errors    and    comparator    bandwidth    limitations,    an
external   instrument   is   required   to   measure   driver
transition  time  errors.  The  reference  used  for  driver
transition   time   measurements   is   a   high   bandwidth-
digital sampling oscilloscope.
