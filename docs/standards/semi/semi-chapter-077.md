SEMI F12-0998 © SEMI 1993, 19981 SEMI F12-0998TEST METHOD TO DETERMINE THE SEALING CAPABILITIES OFFITTINGS, MADE OF FLUOROCARBON MATERIAL, AFTER BEINGSUBJECTED TO A HEAT CYCLE 1 Purpose1.1 This method provides a unifor m procedure todetermine the sealing capabilities of fluorocarbon resinfittings, after they have been subjected to an elevatedambient temperature and cooled to room temperature(hereafter referred to as a Heat Cycle). 2 Scope2.1 This method can be used to ch aracterize thethermal characteristics of tube fitting connections onthe basis of test data obtained under the conditionsdescribed herein, but the results are not intended toimply a performance rating.2.2 When using this test method, a fitting bodytemperature range of 23°  125°C (73°  257°F) shouldbe maintained.2.3 Tube defined in this method is made offluorocarbon materials.2.4 Tube fittings defined in this m ethod are made offluorocarbon materials for all parts in contact with theinternal fluid. Parts such as nuts and grippers are notlimited to being made of a fluorocarbon material.2.5 Only the seal between the tube and tube fittingbeing evaluated is within the scope of this document.All other seals are beyond the scope of this document.2.6 When using this method for m aking comparisonsbetween various tube fitting manufacturers, the usermust be specific in the selection of the tube and tubefittings to be evaluated.NOTE: The International System of Units (SI) is used as thestandard unit of measure in this document. The U.S.Customary Units are in parentheses for reference purposesonly and have been rounded to the nearest whole value. 3 Summary of Method3.1 Measure the leakage of the tub e fitting connectionafter being exposed to a heat cycle by subjecting thefitting to an internal pressure with nitrogen. 4 Significance and Use4.1 In the manufacturing of semic onductor products,many types of hazardous chemicals and solvents arerequired. As a result, tubing and various fittings madeof fluorocarbon materials (which are chemically resistant to these fluids) are used to transport thosefluids. It is important to control the testing processwhen evaluating various fitting designs, so that accuratecomparisons of the sealing capabilities of tube fittingconnections can be made.4.2 It is the intent of this method t o provide aprocedure which evaluates the sealing capability of thetube fitting connection when subjected to a change inambient temperature.4.3 The results obtained when usin g this method areapplicable only to conditions that specifically duplicatethe procedures used within this method.4.4 When using this test method, i t is assumed that thetest specimens are truly representative of the materialand manufacturing process specified for that product.Departure from this assumption could introducediscrepancies that are greater than those introduced bydeparture from the details of the procedure outlined inthis method. 5 Terminology5.1 Acronyms5.1.1 O.D.

SEMI F13-1101 © SEMI 1993, 2001 2 5 Terminology5.1 automatic shut-off (ASO)  A remotely actuatedvalve, preferably the cylinder valve, but possibly avalve located close to the cylinder valve, which canisolate the product as close to the cylinder valve aspossible. It may also be a device which attaches to thecylinder valve stem or handle to close the valve.5.2 compressed gas association (CGA) Organization that sets standards for the handling andsafe use of gases. Used in this document to refer to thecylinder valve outlet connection for each product asdesignated by the CGA.5.3 cylinder  A pressure vessel designed forpressures higher than 276 kPa (40 pounds per squareinch absolute) and having a circular cross section. Itdoes not include a portable tank, multi-unit tank cartank, cargo tank, or tank car. It also refers to non-DOTlow pressure containers used for liquid product havinglow vapor pressure.5.4 gas source control equipment (GSCE)  Refers tothe equipment assembly beginning at the product exitfrom the cylinder valve to the beginning of thedistribution piping leading to the point of use (POU).These assemblies are usually mounted on panels andare sometimes referred to as process panel systems.5.5 hazardous production material (HPM)  A solid,liquid, or gas that has a degree-of-hazard rating inhealth, flammability, or reactivity of Class 3 or 4 asranked by NFPA 704 and which is used directly inresearch, laboratory, or production processes whichhave, as their end product, materials which are nothazardous.5.6 high pressure isolation (HPI) valve  A shut-offvalve located on the high-pressure side of a gas pipingsystem that, when closed, isolates the purged volumefrom the pressure regulator and other downstreamcomponents.5.7 low pressure isolation (LPI) valve  A shut-offvalve located on the low-pressure side of a gas systemthat, when closed, isolates the purged volume from thedistribution piping and all other downstreamcomponents.5.8 point of use (POU)  Refers to the manufacturingtool which uses the product. Point of use isdistinguished from the GSCE by having its own designcriteria, separate function, and physical separation fromthe GSCE.5.9 product  Refers to the gas phase in the cylinder. 6 Configuration6.1 Manual/Auto Operation6.1.1 Manual equipment without automation isadequate if it includes an ASO plus excess flow device.(Where required, per UFC articles 51 and 80.)Automated purging is generally more efficient thanmanual purging and is, therefore, recommended. TheASO function is achieved if the ASO valveautomatically defaults to a closed position via apneumatically actuated valve, or separate actuator thatwill close a manual cylinder valve. Either methodshould be fail-safe (default to a closed position on lossof power and/or pneumatics). This could also beinitiated by any number of abnormal circumstances.6.1.2 Fully Automatic  This is a broad category ofdesigns using any number of transducers, remotelyoperated valves, and logic to accomplish safeguarding,monitoring, and automatic purging. Extension of thisapproach to central data collection, analysis, andreporting via computers and special programs offers thecapability of further reducing hazards and enhancingsafety.6.2 Cylinder Connections6.2.1 Compressed gas cylinders are connected to thepanel equipment using the connection on the outlet ofthe cylinder valve. The appropriate regulatory agencyhas designated one or more connections for eachproduct gas.6.2.2 Other containers for liquid or low vapor pressurematerials may require the connection of two fittings.One of these is used to admit gas, which eitherpressurizes the product, allowing liquid withdrawal, orabsorbs the product, allowing withdrawal of a gas-phase mixture of the product and the gas. The otherfitting is used for withdrawal. The types and labeling ofthe connections vary among suppliers.6.2.3 High Pressure Pigtail  A semi-flexibleassembly of piping, subjected to cylinder pressure,which is used to connect the cylinder to the rigidlymounted components on the panel. The intent of thisflexible assembly is to accommodate the location of thecylinder outlet.6.2.4 No Pigtail  An alternate acceptable methodallows cylinders to be elevated or lowered to match thefixed height of the connection point on fixed panelequipment.6.3 Cross Contamination6.3.1 Purge Gas Cylinder Contamination by ProcessGas  Purge gas is supplied from cylinders, with eachpurge gas cylinder limited to a single process gas panelor several panels using the same process gas class or

&lt;!-- Page 9 --&gt;

SEMI F13-1101 © SEMI 1993, 20013 different mixture ratios of the same process gas class. Acheck valve should be installed in each line connectingthe purge gas to the process panel equipment.6.3.2 Process Gas Cylinder Contamination by PurgeGas  The purpose of purging is to remove air orresidual process gas from the panel equipment (or partof it) back to the internal cavity of the closed cylindervalve.WARNING: Check valves are not acceptable in thispart of the process gas system because purging wouldbe defeated. Cross contamination can only be preventedby safeguards which assure complete cylinder valveclosure and process gas venting, before purging begins.6.4 Materials  All materials furnished should bemanufactured to nationally recognized standards.Metals used for the wetted surfaces should be type 3l6Lstainless steel, or other materials that provide equal orimproved compatibility with the gas in service.Nonmetallic seals that are used in valve or regulatorseats must also be compatible with the product inservice.6.5 Joints  All welded joints should be butt welded(no socket welds) and should comply with SEMI F3.Connection fittings should be face seal type.6.6 Particle Control  Particle contamination iscontrolled through the proper selection of componentsand system hardware, good design practices, clean fabrication methods, and proper operation of thesystem.6.7 Internal Volume  The internal cavities should beconfigured for minimum surface area and internalvolume to enhance purging. Dead end legs should beeliminated or kept to a minimum volume and length.6.8 Maintainability  Planned maintenance or forcedrepair is facilitated or inhibited by specific designconcepts and features. From a safety point of view, it ismandatory to be able to purge the entire GSCE (allcavities) and to have a downstream shutoff (lowpressure isolation valve) and disconnect fitting. 7 Performance Recommendations7.1 Functional Recommendations7.1.1 The ASO should be designed to close based onan alarm or fail signal from an auxiliary component. Itshould be designed to fail closed and should have aworking pressure at least 1.1 times the product cylinderpressure. If a pressure sensor is located between theASO and the cylinder valve, as depicted in Figure 1, itshould also have a working pressure at least 1.1 timesthe product cylinder pressure.7.1.2 Pressure Reduction  Gases are mostcommonly required at POU at less than 100 psig.Cylinder pressure is reduced to the lower pressure by agas pressure regulator, when necessary. CONNECTION Figure 1Typical Gas Source Control System

&lt;!-- Page 10 --&gt;

SEMI F13-1101 © SEMI 1993, 2001 4 7.1.3 Excess Pressure Control  Provisions should bemade to protect the distribution piping and processequipment from excessive pressure. This protectionmay include a pressure transducer, pressure switch, orindicating transmitter connected to close the ASO, arelief valve piped into the exhaust, or a redundantpressure regulator with primary regulator failureindication.7.1.4 Cylinder Contents  The product remaining inthe cylinder is determined by gas pressure measured byeither a pressure transducer or gauge, or in the case ofmaterial in liquid/vapor phase, by the cylinder weightmeasured by a scale.7.1.5 Delivery Pressure  The pressure delivered bythe regulator is displayed by a pressure indicator. Thiscan be either a gauge or transducer readout.7.1.6 Filters  Particles from ambient sources,entering with the product or generated by the systemelements, can be captured by including one or morefilters at a variety of locations within the system. Thispractice tends to protect the components and theprocess.7.1.7 Purge Gas Connection  A purge gasconnection is provided via a branched connection toadmit clean, dry, inert purge gas through an on-offvalve. This is commonly located between the cylinderconnection and high pressure isolation valve in thepanel system. Gas purging is used for installation of anew system, before disconnecting a spent cylinder, afterconnecting a fresh cylinder, and for removal ofequipment for maintenance purposes.7.1.8 Vent Outlets  The normal purpose of the ventvalves is to discharge process gas, air, and purge gas inconjunction with purging operations. Under specialcircumstances, they are used to reduce pressure in theequipment and/or transfer product. One or more ventsmay be used at various locations, and downstreamventing may be either atmospheric pressure or vacuumfrom a venturi or pump. Vacuum venting is stronglyrecommended.7.1.9 High Pressure Indication  A pressure indicatorin common with the high pressure line connected to thecylinder valve is required to indicate the presence ofresidual process gas, or an open or leaking cylinder orpanel valve. It also shows application of adequate purgegas pressure, and, in cases where vacuum-assistedpurging is employed, an indication of the vacuum levelshould be included.7.1.10 Cylinder Connection Makeup  After a freshcylinder has been connected, the integrity of thecylinder valve connection can be tested with the use ofthe pressure indicator mentioned in Section 7.1.9. 7.2 Failure Modes  Any one of a number ofconditions will require emergency action. Some aremore serious than others. In some cases, theconsequence is shutdown of the panel equipment andventing to a properly controlled discharge system.These failures should be addressed in the hardware andoperational design phase of the system.7.2.1 Excessive Delivery Pressure  Due toequipment malfunction or operator error.7.2.2 Leaking fitting or component malfunction mayrequire gas detection monitor.7.2.3 Excess Flow  This can be the result of operatorerror or catastrophic conditions, such as a sheareddelivery line.7.2.4 Cabinet exhaust failure.7.2.5 Mechanical failure of panel equipment parts ordownstream equipment.7.2.6 Destruction to plant through fire, explosion,earthquake, crash, etc.7.2.7 Inadvertent mishandling of distributionequipment.7.2.8 Process tool problems.7.2.9 Control system failure.7.2.10 System Abuse/Misuse  Source gas quality mayaffect service life and operability of the system. Poorgas product quality may cause a reduction inperformance of the system that can lead to prematurehardware component failures. 8 Acceptance Test8.1 All gas source control equipment should undergoan acceptance test, agreed to and understood by thecustomer and supplier, before it is delivered. This testshould ensure that all control and operational functionsperform as required by the customers and/or suppliersspecifications. 9 Qualification Test9.1 GSCE should be qualified at its installed locationwith an inert gas prior to installing the process gascylinder. This test should include the operation of allcontrol and hardware functions, interface with theprocess tool and all interconnected safety devices,systems, and alarms. This should also include a systemwide leak test of all possible leak points, such as fittingsand welds.

A1-1 ScopeA1-1.1 Under special circumstances, it may benecessary to cease using a product and remove it fromthe cabinet to a safer and/or less populatedenvironment. This can be done in a number of ways.A1-1.2 If the cylinder valve cannot be opened orclosed, the gas supplier must be notified. Priorarrangements between the supplier and user ofprocedures should be in place, so that the requiredactions can be readily accomplished. A1-2 Transfer Out of CylinderA1-2.1 Close the low pressure isolation valve,disconnect at the downstream side of either of the ventvalves and connect to a suitable receiver with means ofpumping if required. This depends upon knowledgeableoperators, and the procedure to be followed must reflectthe features of the particular GSCE and the product tobe transferred. Extreme caution must be observed. A1-3 Removal of the CylinderA1-3.1 A cylinder with a faulty or questionablecylinder valve may have to be removed. When aredundant valve and disconnect is installed in thepigtail, it may be closed, disconnected, and removedwith the cylinder with relative ease and security. Whena redundant valve is not present and a particular designallows it, the purge inlet valve, vent valve, and the HPisolation valve may be closed and removed with thepigtail still connected to the questionable cylinder.Adequate purging should precede this procedure.

SEMI F15-93 (Reapproved 1104)TEST METHOD FOR ENCLOSURES USING SULFUR HEXAFLUORIDETRACER GAS AND GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY This Test Method was technically reapproved by the Global Gases Committee and is the direct responsibilityof the North American Gases Committee. Current edition approved by the North American RegionalStandards Committee on July 11, 2004. Initially available on www.semi.org September 2004; to bepublished November 2004. Originally published in 1993; last published June 1999. 1 Purpose1.1 The purpose of this test method is to provide astandardized method to test the ability of enclosures tocontain gases and vapors and a standardized format torecord and document test results. 2 Scope2.1 This test method applies to any enclosure thatpossesses a local exhaust (secondary ventilation)system.2.2 In this test method, the tracer gas of choice is sulfurhexafluoride (SF6). It is recognized that other gaseshave been used as tracers, but for the purposes of thistest method, tracer gas means SF6.NOTICE: This standard does not purport to addresssafety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is theresponsibility of the users of this standard to establishappropriate safety and health practices and determinethe applicability of regulatory or other limitations priorto use. 3 Limitations3.1 This test method is intended to test the containmentability of a local exhaust system within an enclosureunder the manufacturers specified operatingconditions. Thus, test data obtained by means of thistest method apply only to the local exhaust conditionsthat existed within the enclosure during the testing.Extrapolation of the test data to other exhaust operatingconditions is not usually possible.3.2 Use of this test method requires knowledge of theprinciples of gas analysis as well as flow and pressuremeasurement, gas chromatographic instrumentation,and gas sampling techniques.3.3 An acceptable enclosure, as determined in Section7.1, does not imply a safe condition for routineequipment operation with a leak and/or a tubing/fittingfailure. An acceptable enclosure is one that will containpotential worst case leaks in an emergency, non-routinesituation. The fact that an enclosure is acceptable doesnot imply that the enclosure is safe to operate when ahazardous gas leak has been detected. 4 Referenced Standards4.1 SEMI StandardSEMI S2  Environmental, Health, and SafetyGuidelines for Semiconductor ManufacturingEquipment 4.2 ASTM Standards1 ASTM E 260  Practice for Packed Column GasChromatographyASTM E 697  Practice for Use of Electron CaptureDetectors in Gas Chromatography 4.3 NFPA Standard2 NFPA 704  Standard System for the Identification ofthe Fire Hazards of Materials for Emergency ResponseNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documentscited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology5.1 Definitions5.1.1 equivalent release concentration (ERC)  thetheoretical concentration of a process gas that would bemeasured outside an enclosure in the event of a processline failure.

6 Summary of Method6.1 A test is performed by releasing tracer gas at aconstant flow rate within an enclosure to simulate aworst case leak and then measuring on the periphery ofthe enclosure for the presence or absence of tracer. Thelack of measurable tracer indicates that the release ofpotentially hazardous gases or vapors within theenclosure at the tracer injection point(s) will not resultin their migration to the outside of the enclosure. Gassamples are taken by means of disposable syringes,sample bags, or sample vials. Gas samples areanalyzed by means of electron capture gaschromatography. 7 Procedure7.1 Test Design7.1.1 Determine the type of enclosure to be tested, suchas: non-access, access, vacuum pump, equipmentcabinet, or other.7.1.2 Determine the volume of the enclosure.7.1.3 Measure the exhaust flow rate from theenclosure.7.1.4 Calculate the air changes per minute of theenclosure by dividing the exhaust flow rate (Section7.1.3) by the enclosure volume (Section 7.1.2).7.1.5 Calculate the time at which the tracerconcentration in the enclosure will achieve approximateequilibrium. Concentration equilibrium occurs whenthe tracer concentration in the enclosure stops changingas a function of time for a constant tracer release rate.Divide 3 by the air changes per minute to establish thistime. Use this as the time to take the first sample afterinitiating a test. Appendix 1 provides a derivation ofthe equilibrium time.NOTE 1: This test method is intended to test the containmentability of the local exhaust system within an enclosure whenoperated according to the manufacturers specifications. Thus,testing should be performed with the local exhaust operatingunder its manufacturer's recommended conditions.7.1.6 If an excess flow control system is used,determine the trip point for each hazardous gas used. Ifdifferent gases are used in the enclosure, the largest trippoint should be used to calculate the tracer release flowrate.7.1.7 If no excess flow system or flow-restrictingorifice is used, the maximum accidental release ratemust be calculated from the known maximum systempressure and either valve coefficients or tubing ID. Anequation for flow through straight tubing is provided inAppendix 2. 7.1.8 In the absence of guidance in the above twosections, a standard test is the release of tracer gasthrough 6.35 mm (0.25 inch) OD by 0.89 mm (0.035inch) wall tubing at a rate of 28 standard liters perminute (slpm) (1 scfm). Appendix 3 derives a generalequation, A3-7, that can be used when this is not thecase.7.2 Reagents and Materials  Use SF6 diluted in aninert gas, such as nitrogen or argon, as the tracer source,to minimize measurement difficulties associated withsmall leaks of pure SF6 from the supply cylinder and itsassociated piping.7.3 Sampling7.3.1 In selecting the location of samples collectedoutside the enclosure, consider 1) potential leak points,2) the direction of the release, and 3) laminar flowcharacteristics in the area surrounding the enclosure.Samples should be collected from all sides of theenclosure, downstream in the prevailing room air flow,and in the operating personnel occupancy areas.7.3.2 The time required for the enclosure to reachequilibrium should be considered when establishing thetime to begin sampling. The first sample after initiatingtracer flow should be taken at the enclosure equilibriumtime. Collect additional samples at 1 to 2 minuteintervals until the tracer source is shut off. One sampleshould be taken 1 minute after the tracer source is shutoff. The test duration can be changed to accommodatea particular test.7.3.3 Collect background (baseline) samples from thearea surrounding the enclosure at predeterminedlocations. When logistics permit, analyze thebackground samples before releasing the tracer gas. Ifbackground levels above approximately 1 ppb aredetected, evaluate the integrity of the SF6 tracerdelivery system, and postpone the test until theconcentration is less than 1 ppb. Other sources of SF6in the immediate test area may also cause thisbackground.NOTE 2: If testing is performed with an SF6 background, thebackground concentration must be measured and subtractedfrom any subsequently measured tracer concentration value.7.3.4 Release tracer gas within the enclosure beingtested by means of an injection manifold, shownschematically in Figure 1. The tracer injectionmanifold must be capable of measuring flow rates to anaccuracy of ± 5%. The tracer gas delivery line must berouted into the enclosure and attached to a potentialleak point without violating the integrity of theenclosure.NOTE 3: To minimize tracer gas contamination of the areasurrounding an enclosure during a test, the end of the tracer SEMI F15-93 © SEMI 1993, 2004 2

&lt;!-- Page 18 --&gt;

injection line should be capped, except when performing aninjection test.7.3.5 Perform several tests with differing directions ofrelease relative to any opening or penetration in theenclosure. The location and direction of the releaseshall effectively simulate an actual gas release ortubing/fitting failure within the enclosure. A worst casefailure can be simulated by locating the tracer injectionpoint at the potential leak location closest to apenetration or opening within the enclosure with thedirection of tracer injection pointed directly at theopening or penetration.7.3.6 After initiation of tracer injection, collect grab airsamples from the area surrounding the enclosure atpredetermined times and locations. These samplesshould be analyzed immediately after collection. If thisis not possible, they should be sealed. Label thesamples as to time and location. Samples may be takenwith: a) Containers that are non-absorbent, inert, andthat have low permeability (such as polyvinyl fluoridefilm or polyester film sample bags or polyethylene,polypropylene, nylon, or glass bottles) or b) disposablesyringes. Disposable syringes can be used to injectsamples into the gas chromatograph directly.7.3.7 Record: a) the actual (measured) tracer gasrelease rate, b) the actual SF6 concentration in the tracergas being used, and c) the actual release time during atest.7.3.8 Collect air samples as described in Section 7.3.6,and analyze them for the presence or absence of tracergas using a gas chromatograph. The measurement of anon-zero tracer concentration in the area surrounding anenclosure indicates incomplete containment ofcontaminants within the enclosure.7.3.9 Analyze samples according to ASTM E 260 andASTM E 697 in conjunction with the chromatographmanufacturer's operating procedures. Samples may beanalyzed immediately after a test, or they may be storedfor future analysis. Experience has shown nodegradation of concentration in polypropylene syringeswhen stored for several months as long as the needle orsyringe is plugged. Polypropylene syringes should bediscarded after one use to eliminate the possibility ofcross contamination of samples. 8 Calculations and Interpretation of Results8.1 The maximum concentration of SF6 measured in asample collected outside the enclosure is used tocalculate the Equivalent Release Concentration (ERC)by the following formula: ERC = Conc. of process gas  Measured SF6 Conc.Tracer Injection gas conc. 8.1.1 The above formula assumes the process gastubing that fails is the same diameter as the tracer gasinjection tubing. Appendix 3 contains a generalequation that can be used when this is not the case.8.2 Compare the Equivalent Release Concentration tothe hazardous process gas TLV or PEL, whichever islower. If the ERC is above the prescribed limits, theenclosure is not considered to be acceptable; if the ERCis less than or equal to the prescribed limit, theenclosure is considered acceptable. SEMI S2recommends appropriate control limits for an enclosure. 9 Reporting Results9.1 Present all results in tabular form in a mannerwhich unambiguously notes those enclosure(s) that donot satisfy the criteria of SEMI S2. The exhaustoperating conditions during each test must be providedalong with each measured ERC value.9.2 Describe tracer gas injection points withinindividual enclosures to detail location and proximity toopenings, penetrations, exhaust grillwork, accesspanels, and other potential leakage sites, such that worstcase leak conditions have been simulated.9.3 Describe the unit being tested by manufacturer,model number, and serial number to provideidentification of the unit being tested.9.4 Tabulate and record the name, supplyconcentration, maximum flow rate, and TLV or PEL foreach hazardous gas or vapor used within each enclosurebeing tested.

APPENDIX 1EQUILIBRIUM TIME FOR TRACER INJECTIONNOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI F15 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures. A1-1A1-1.1 If a tracer gas is injected at a constant rate intoan enclosure that possesses a constant ventilation rate,the concentration as a function of time is given asC(t) = (F/q) \[1 - exp&#123;-(q/V)t&#125;\] (A1 -1)where C t( ) = Concentration within the enclosureF = Injection rate of tracer gasq = Ventilation rate of enclosureV = Volume of enclosuret = Elapsed time since initiating injection A1-1.2 Note that the term (q/V) contained in theexponential is the air change rate. In order for theconcentration C(t) to be constant, the exponential termmust be approximately zero. This is generally taken asthe time when the exponential term is equal to e-3. Thetime at which this occurs can be found by setting (q/V)t= 3 and solving for t. Thus,(q / V )t = 3 A1- 2( ) from which it follows that the equilibrium time is givenas,t = 3/(q/V) (A1- 3)t = 3(V/q) (A1- 4) SEMI F15-93 © SEMI 1993, 20045

APPENDIX 3GENERAL EQUATION RELATING PROCESS GAS FLOW RATE TOTRACER INJECTION RATENOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI F15-93 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures. A3-1A3-1.1 In this appendix, a general equation relatingprocess gas flow rate, tracer injection flow rate, andmeasured SF6 concentration outside an enclosure to theERC is provided. In the following, Q and L are givenin volume units per unit time. Concentrations C aregiven in units of either vol./vol. or %. Whatever unitsare chosen should be used consistently in Equation A3-7.A3-1.2 Let the tracer injection rate into a volume be Qand the ventilation rate in this volume is L. Atequilibrium, the concentration of tracer within thisvolume is Q/L = Csource. If, in the laboratory, onemeasures a concentration of tracer gas Clab, then theDilution Ratio, D, can be calculated as equal toClab/Csource \]tracer = Dtracer (A3-1)For any conserved chemical species, D is constant.Thus, for a process gas released within the volume, onecan form an analogous ratioClab/Csource \]process = Dprocess (A3-2)For all conserved chemical species, D is constant, henceDtracer = Dprocess (A3-3)From this, one can formClab/Csource \]tracer = Clab/Csource \]process (A3-4)so thatClab/Csource \]tracer  Csource \]process = Clab \]process (A3-5)Here Clab \]process is the previously identified ERC.For releases in the same test volume, this equation canbe written&#123;Clab \]tracer  (Q/L)\]process&#125;/ (Q/L)\]tracer = ERC (A3-6)Since the ventilation rate is the sameClab \]tracer  Qprocess / Qtracer = ERC (A3-7)A3-1.2.1 This equation allows the calculation of ERCwhen simulating a leak within an enclosure using adifferent diameter tubing or different flowrate. In thecase where the flowrates (or tubing size and injectionpressure) are the same for the tracer and the processgas, Equation A3-7 simplifies to that in Section 5.1.

Such a controlled 1 American Society for Testing and Materials, 100 Barr HarborDrive, West Conshohoken, PA 19428-29592 Plastic Pipe Institute, 355 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY10017 environment may be accomplished by immersing thespecimens in a controlled-temperature water or air bath.The time-to-failure is measured.5.1.2 D 2837  The procedure for e stimating long-term hydrostatic strength is essentially an extrapolation,with respect to time, of a stress-time regression linebased on data obtained in accordance with ASTM D1598. Stress-failure time plots are obtained for theselected temperature and environment: theextrapolation is made in such a manner that the long-term hydrostatic strength is estimated for theseconditions.5.2 PPI Technical Report5.2.1 TR-3/92  These policies and procedures are fordevelopment of recommendations for thermoplasticpipe compounds based on test data from good qualitypipes made by specific processing techniques. Theserecommendations may or may not be valid for pipesmade by differing processing techniques. 6 Comments6.1 The Hydrostatic Stress Comm ittee of the PlasticPipe Institute (PPI) has recommended a minimumsafety factor of 200% based on the hydrostatic designbasis. The safety factor is intended to make allowancefor manufacturing and testing variables such as normalvariations in the material, manufacturing process,dimensions, and in the evaluation procedures (ASTM D2837 and D 1598).6.2 Application conditions also ne ed to be taken intoconsideration and may require an increased safetyfactor. For example, with liquid hydrocarbons and otherchemicals, temperature can have a disproportionaleffect on the long-term performance of the tubing orpipe. No general safety factor has been established forthese types of services, so each case should be designedon its own merit.NOTE: It is strongly recommended that the user of pipe/tubeconfirm that the product has been tested per ASTM D 1598, D2837, and TR-3/92 to ensure a proper pressure rating.

SEMI F20-0305 © SEMI 1995, 20055 APPENDIX 1THE EFFECTS OF SULFUR ON GTA WELDING OF 316L STAINLESSSTEEL NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI F20 and was approved by full letter ballotprocedures. A1-2 Effects of SulfurA1-2.1 AISI Type 316L austenitic stainless steel is the preferred material for components of gas supply systems forsemiconductor fabrication. The composition of 316L specified in Table I of ASTM A 182/A 182M, ASTM A 240,ASTM A 269, ASTM A 276, ASTM A 479/A 479M, or ASTM A 632, has a maximum of 0.030 percent Sulfur;however several properties affecting the manufacture and applications of 316L can vary significantly over this rangeof Sulfur content. Therefore a lower Sulfur maximum is specified in SEMI F20, as listed in 6.3.2 and Table 1 of6.3.3.A1-2.2 Sulfur has a very low solubility in austenitic stainless steels, thus in these alloys it exists as discreteinclusions of Manganese Sulfide, with some solubility for Chromium as well as other trace elements. Theseinclusions can initiate pits and other defects on electropolished surfaces, increasing in number with increasing Sulfurcontent.A1-2.3 The Manganese Sulfide inclusions improve the machinability of stainless steel; compositions intended formachining have Sulfur compositions near the 0.030 percent maximum, whereas stainless steels with very low Sulfurlevels require lower feeds and speeds and will cause reduced tool life during machining.A1-2.4 Sulfur also strongly affects welding of stainless steel; variation of Sulfur from very low contents to themaximum permitted can increase weld bead penetration by approximately a factor of two for similar weldparameters.A1-2.5 The effects of Sulfur are summarized in Table A1-1. A1-2 Welding Effects of SulfurA1-2.1 Two effects are observed on welding with variations in Sulfur level:A1-2.1.1 As Sulfur is reduced the heat input required for full penetration increases.A1-2.1.2 As Sulfur is reduced below approximately 0.005 percent there is a marked change in weld pool dynamics,causing the weld pool to become wider and shallower2.Table A1-1  Effects of Sulfur on Austenitic Stainless Steels As Sulfur increases from zero to the 0.030% maximum permitted: Effects ResultsMachinability improves.  Lower machining costs for machined parts. Inclusion density increases.  More pits, stringers, other defects on surface. Decreased corrosion resistance, particularly on end grains. Welding penetration increases.  Weld settings must be reset when changing lots. Problems welding materials with dissimilar Sulfur contents. 2 K. Watanabe and K.

SEMI F20-0305 © SEMI 1995, 2005 6 As Sulfur increases from zero to the 0.030% maximum permitted:Solidification temperature range increases.  Increased segregation in weld. Rougher weld bead surface. A1-2.1.3 The latter effect is due to a reversal of the convection currents in the weld pool at approximately 0.005percent Sulfur. At Sulfur levels significantly above 0.005 percent the convective currents flow downward from thearc, causing deep penetration as illustrated in Figure A1-1, whereas at Sulfur levels well below about 0.005 percentthe convective currents flow outward from the arc, causing a wider weld pool and shallower penetration asillustrated in Figure A1-23. Figure A1-1Convection Currents in the Weld Pool During Welding of Stainless Steel with &gt;&gt;0.005% Sulfur Levels Figure A1-2Convection Currents in the Weld Pool During Welding of Stainless Steel with &lt;&lt;0.005% Sulfur Levels A1-2.1.4 Serious problems can occur when attempting to weld two pieces of stainless steel with substantiallydifferent Sulfur contents. The weld pool can become asymmetric, favoring the low Sulfur side, and cause the root ofthe weld to shift away from the joint, as illustrated in Figure A1-3. Figure A1-3The Weld Pool is Asymmetric When Welding Stainless Steel Pieces with Significantly Different Sulfur Levels A1-2.1.5 In order to minimize this effect it is desirable to match Sulfur contents in components to be welded towithin ± 0.007 percentage points. Greater differences in Sulfur contents require very careful weld set-up to ensurefull penetration to the root of the joint. 3 Pollard, B., The Effects of Minor Elements on the Welding Characteristics of Stainless Steel, Welding Research Supplement, 202 (Sept 1988).

SEMI F20-0305 © SEMI 1995, 20057 A1-2.1.6 These effects lead to the following recommendations to ensure optimum weld quality when weldingstainless steel:A1-2.1.6.3 Check compositions of pieces to be welded. Match Sulfur contents to within ± 0.007 percentage points.A1-2.1.6.3 Welding of pieces with very low Sulfur (&lt; 0.003 % approximately) may require additional attention tothe establishment of appropriate weld settings to achieve full, uniform penetration. It is recommended that productwith wall thickness &gt; 0.100 inch approximately be restricted to &gt; 0.003 % Sulfur.A1-2.1.6.3 Establish weld settings for piece lots to be welded; recheck whenever changing lots.

SEMI F20-0305 © SEMI 1995, 2005 8 APPENDIX 2THE EFFECTS OF COPPER AS A TRACE ELEMENT ON GTAWELDING OF 316L STAINLESS STEELNOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI F20 and was approved by full letter ballotprocedures. A2-1 Copper in Stainless SteelA2-1.1 Copper is a residual or unspecified element in AISI 316L. It is not an intentional addition, but is present inany heat of material as a result of the composition of the furnace charge materials used, which are typicallyprimarily scrap with elemental and master alloy additions to achieve the composition desired. Levels of unspecifiedelements such as Copper are permitted up to 0.50% maximum by AMS 2248E4. Copper content can only bereduced in the melt by dilution. Over time, as more scrap material is recycled, the residual levels of copper in heatsof AISI 316L is anticipated to increase.A2-1.2 Copper is an austenite phase stabilizer. It also has been shown to improve the resistance of austeniticstainless steels to stress corrosion cracking in chloride solutions. A2-2 Effects of Copper on WeldingA2-2.1 In welding, copper is a surface-active element (like S, O, and Se) and has been shown to contributesignificantly to weld bead meander. Like manganese, it will volatilize during welding and redeposit downstream ofthe weld, providing a site for the initiation of corrosion in some conditions. Some end users may restrict copper as apotential source of weld contamination or corrosion.A2-2.2 A correlation was noted between increased copper content and weld bead meander in a wafer fab project5.Five heats of 0.25 in. tubing were evaluated. Copper was very prominent in the HAZ of one heat (0.47% Cu and0.011% S) which had a bead meander problem when welded. Another heat with the same sulfur content and a lowercopper content (0.03% Cu) did not exhibit bead meander. Another heat (0.31% Cu and 0.010% S) showed oxidationafter welding. All welds were performed in argon.A2-2.3 In a study of 28 heats of tubing from 0.25 to 2.0 inch in diameter, copper ranged from 0.05 to 0.41%6. Ofthe 28 heats tested, 10 had copper contents above 0.25%, and among the nine heats of 2.0 in. diameter tubing, allhad copper levels above 0.22%, with four of the heats above 0.25%. Cosmetically unacceptable welds (slag,discoloration and/or bead meander) occurred on heats with: 0.26% Cu, 0.005% S; 0.28% Cu, 0.009% S; and 0.41%Cu, 0.005% S. Conversely, cosmetically acceptable welds were performed on a heat with 0.3% Cu and 0.011% S.All welds were performed using argon.A2-2.4 Data was presented at a SEMI Workshop and repeated here concerning the effect of copper content andshield gas interactions on weldability7. Two examples of heats of AISI 316L tubing, 2.5 in. in diameter, with coppercontents above 0.3%, demonstrated that adding hydrogen to the argon shield gas adversely affected the weldabilityof the tubing (see Figure A2-1). This same effect was not noted in heats of tubing with copper levels below 0.3%. Inaddition, the weld electrodes undergo severe degradation when welding tubing with copper contents above 0.3% andusing Ar/H 2 shield gas (see Figure A2-2).A2-2.5 Based on the above information, the following conclusions can be made:A2-2.5.1 The copper restriction in SEMI F20 currently stands at 0.30%. This restriction is due to weldabilityeffects. 4 Aerospace Materials Specification (AMS) 2248E, "Chemical Check Analysis Limits: Corrosion and Heat Resisting Steels and Alloys,Maraging and Other Highly Alloyed Steels, and Iron Alloys," SAE International, Warrendale, PA; issued 15 January 1960, Revised 1 October1993, 6 pp5 R.

(a) 2.5 in. tubing, Cu content 0.37%. Beadmeander condition became evident with additionof H2 to shield gas. (b) 2.5 in. tubing, Cu content 0.34%. Beadmeander condition became evident with additionof H 2 to shield gas, worsened with each weld.
